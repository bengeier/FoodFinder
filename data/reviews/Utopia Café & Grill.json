{"text":"Utopia Cafe and Grill is aptly named. Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.

It was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.

Needless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!

And if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.

I started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.

Between the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.

On a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.

If Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.

For a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).

Utopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal."}
{"text":"Pretty good, could have used a little more spice options. 

I'll go back"}
{"text":"I'm not one to wait in line...for anything...ever. However I found myself doing that very thing at Utopia last Sunday. A 30 minute wait for a 3 person table, which at any other place would drive me mad. 

That seemed paltry by the time I saw down and ate the food. What a delight. Everything was impeccable. I could look up synonyms for impeccable and just recite those but you get the point. 

Don't let the small front dining area fool you (it fooled me), there are more tables in the back so just bail on the line. Wait it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant after finding out our previous choice of restaurants changed menu offerings. We were in the area walking on the street and asked a guy in his thirties carrying a six pack of a craft beer for a restaurant suggestion.  He said he eats at the Utopia and you can't go wrong.
He was right. 
My wife had the grilled salmon which she enjoyed and said was fresh.  I had a salmon burrito which was delicious.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I wanted to try to eat a little healthier and it hit the mark.
My son got the steak.  He ordered it medium rare and it came out too rare for him to eat, so he sent it back without any problems and it came back just the way he wanted it.

They served the dinners with a side, my son had the french fried potatoes which he enjoyed a great deal.  We all received a very generous helping of salad which was excellent.

This is a restaurant we would make one of our regulars if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 would be best fitting. Really cute place, definately a hip spot to take a girl out on a date, and very affordable. The menu is simple, but effective. A hipster diner? A couple beers on tap, and a very tasty lamb burger. We also ordered the spring rolls and samosas, both of which where absolutely forgettable. The food is not fantastic all around, but there are some gems in the menu, and a friendly and inviting atmosphere makes you want to stay for maybe one extra pint."}
{"text":"I've been to Utopia several times and have always enjoyed it. Although it looks tiny from the street, there's also a covered patio in the back so don't let a line-up (which there often are) deter you, as the line generally moves along nicely. 

The food is unpretentious but with enough flair to give it that special touch to make you think it was totally worth going out for dinner rather than stay in. The fact that there are an abundance of vegetarian options is the icing on the cake. I almost always order the crispy brie as an appetizer. You can't go wrong with melted cheese, fried in rice paper, served with raspberry sauce. Yum! The burgers are delicious, the salads imaginative, and the sandwiches have the perfect combinations. The flavoured mayos make a great dipping sauce for the fries. I have yet to try the desserts but I believe they're made in-house.

On the downside I wish the lighting were a bit better on the patio, it's quite dark at most tables. Like, too dark to read the menu without a flashlight the other night. Also, while I like the fries I don't love them. Perhaps that's just my personal preference as shoestring tend to be my favourite. I will definitely go back, fairly regularly I might add."}
{"text":"Decent little place with plenty of options
Service can be a little surly but they are packed so can afford to be rude 
Veggie burger was the only thing I had that was bad but that's my fault for not sticking to the lamb burger which is great"}
{"text":"For those of you who just want to dine out alone one night and you're afraid of being seen as \"the person who's dining alone, poor them\"... just come to Utopia.  It's warm and inviting and has a simple little menu.  The atmosphere is classy but unpretentious.  I came here one Sunday evening, brought a book, ordered a simple dish (i don't remember what it was, but it was simple enough that I could read my book), and my glass of wine and found it to be very cozy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I havent yelped about Utopia until now...it's one of my regular joints...or perhaps I am one of its regulars?...anyway, I have never been disappointed.  Occasionally the service is slow but I am not in a rush so it doesn't bother me.
I HIGHLY recommend the fish and chips...salmon fish and chips!  Great for boosting your Omega 3's.  They have a pretty fair wine list for a cafe.  
Also, they always seem busy which is good for turn over...not fond of fod that's been sitting around a few days."}
{"text":"I've heard so many rave reviews of this place that I may have walked in with over-inflated expectations.  I was dining in a group of four, two of us vegetarians and the other two were pretty serious meat-eaters so we figured that Utopia would be the perfect compromise.  

I had the vegetarian burger and fries. The burger was huge, juicy and reminiscent of meat --sometimes I find that off-putting but the burger here is very tasty.  The fries, not so much.  They were dry and bland, at least compared to what I was anticipating from a place that is so renowned for poutine.  I can't remember what my dining companions ordered.  Everyone seemed to like their food, but nobody raved about it.  

The atmosphere is the main drawback for me.  Utopia is ALWAYS crowded and I get it, the place is popular therefore it's always packed.  But still, given that crowds are the norm you'd think the servers would be accustomed to working in this environment but they seemed really flustered and we were ignored for the most part.  The small size and large number of patrons also means that there is both little room for the servers to move and that the restaurant is inordinately loud, which makes it very difficult to have dinner conversation.

Overall, the food was decent and I wouldn't mind giving Utopia another chance but I'm not sure if it's worth it to wait for a table and slow service.  If I ever walk by and see some free tables I might just pop in again."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp burrito! It's my go to. The hot sauce on the table is amazing on the rice. The chicken and feta burrito is great as well! Love this place and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food **** Service*** Ambience***

We went to this place after we read about it on blogto looking for the best veg poutine in town. The poutine exceeded our expectations. It was certainly one of the best that u have had. 
I ordered the fish and chips with the side of poutine. The fish and chips too was one the best I have had. The 2 salmon fillets were well  reader and deep fried. It was delicious. 

However, the vegetarian sandwich that my wife got was not the best. They had some good foccacia but they toasted the sandwich so hard, it ruined the experience. The filling was OK... nothing too great. But the portion sizes were huge.

What we disliked the most was how long the service took."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it was packed so it took awhile to get a table but that was to be expected. This place is a casual little restaurant that has a cute patio at the back that goes along with a live atmosphere and friendly servers. The menu is vast here and they have a wide variety of options. Everything from burritos, sandwiches, burgers, quesadillas etc. They keep it simple and really cater to vegetarians (any meat dishes can be substituted for soy) - they have really good vegetarian options. Great prices for large portions but service is quite slow since food took a bit long arriving. I recommend patrons to stick with the Tex-Mex dishes such as the Nachos (which were amazing - vegetarian or not), Burritos and/or Quesadillas as their other dishes such as the burgers did not impress. Their patties are served dry and tasteless together with a cold/hard bun."}
{"text":"My first time here for a friend's birthday. Amazing staff, great vibes, o-k food. My friends ordered nachos and there was WAY too much salt on them. And I'm not just talking \"salted tortilla chips\". There were literally CLUMPS of salt in the dish. 
I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Brie sandwich. I'm not sure if it was the heat or the food, but I felt sick after a few bites. And I'm the type to eat all the way through. The food definitely took longer than it should have, since it was not that busy there (only a few parties like mine, but not everyone ordered their food at the same time). 
The portions are huge, definitely worth the price. I may come back and give it a second shot when the weather is cooler and I don't have to be checking for heat stroke while eating."}
{"text":"The chickpea and potato burrito is my go to every time, it is soo damn good.  Again, the poutine here is also top notch with the veggie gravy.  

Okay, I like this place and am happy to have it in the neigbourhood, but every time I do take out they mess up my order."}
{"text":"Large portions! Had a girl's lunch out here and shared a plate of nachos and some drinks among 3 of us and that was the perfect portion!"}
{"text":"Lunch at 1pm on a Sunday: Service was very slow. My food was just ok and my french fries were serviced cold. Won't be going back. Nothing noteworthy here except that they seemed to be one of the few places on college open for brunch."}
{"text":"We've been for brunch at Utopia a few times & the food has always been consistent. The food is fine. The service is usually pretty good. It doesn't break the bank. The portions are a bit to big. I'm grasping for something to say here.....

I have to confess the only reason that I go here is because it is the only place that one of my friend West End friends wants to go for brunch repeatably. Perhaps I should ask him why it's worth a repeat for brunch :s 

**There are lots of places to go for brunch on the West end, people**"}
{"text":"overwhelming selection of wraps, burgers, salads, and sandwiches.

they have good onion rings and don't chince on the quantity. 

service is friendly and prompt. 

I just keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  The prices are great, the portions are huge and the staff is always friendly.  It's too bad it's not bigger because there is often a line of people waiting to be seated.  
I usually get the chickpea and potato burrito or the grilled chicken salad.  If you love fries, definitely try them here.  They have salt and pepper and are delicious.  The portions are so big that often I have some to to take home and the entrees are less than $10.
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The hubby and I wanted a good burger Sat night and of course looked to blogTO for suggestions. We picked Utopia for several reasons: 1) close to where we live and 2) had heard positive reviews from others. Great recommendation!

We both had burgers, but the menu is full of so many other varieties of burritos, quesadillas, and salads. I'm not a huge fan of big menu and would recommend they shorter it a bit. The hubby got the Utopia burger and I got the chicken burger. Both were delicious, juicy, and we loved the ingredients added. 

The service is so-so, but the quality of the burger makes up for it. I'm a huge fries fan. Can't resist not eating fries and omg, they are good. At first I thought they needed salt added. Glad I didn't add any. As I continued to meat my burger and fries, no additional salt was needed. 

We will be back. Might try something else on the menu, but it may be hard to stray from trying another burger."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great veggie options and always tasty. Yes it can get pretty busy and packed to the gills but a little patience goes a long way. Prices are great and the value is high.  Personal fav is the crispy veggie chicken wrap and they fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday with the husband. Ordered chips and salsa and salad. When the food came out the patrons at the table beside us started panicking and trying to warn us of something -- it took us a moment to realize that a GIANT EXOTIC BUG (cricket-like, about the size of my thumb) walked from the salad plate onto the table. The gentleman serving us was nice but strikingly indifferent -- his response upon bringing the second salad was that the bug probably was in their shipping boxes and that \"this sort of thing is out of our control\". We did get a discount on the second salad and once the bill came, an apology...but perhaps we were hoping that kind of experience would get *at least* the salad free of charge? We politely paid (for some reason even left a little tip- we are Canadian after all, haha) but resolved never to come again...and to post a review."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Utopia given the great reviews there are for this place. However, I left feeling a little undecided.

The menu is enormous, which isn't necessarily a good thing for indecisive people like myself. But there definitely is something for everyone here - pages worth of salads, burritos, sandwiches and burgers, including some veggie options. I finally narrowed it down to burritos and asked the server for some recommendations. She said she loved anything with steak in it, so I went with the Steak & Cheddar burrito - - marinated grilled striploin, cheddar, grilled onions, lettuce, green onion mayo and salsa ($12.50). Not sure if I'd call it a burrito... more like a wrap. Name aside, it was quite tasty. My only complaint was that the mixture of the mayo and salsa got a little watery and started dripping out of my burrito.

All the burritos come with Costa Rican black bean rice and your choice of either a sesame slaw or field mix salad. Since I was in the mood for something unhealthy, I decided to substitute all of that for a side of fries. More like a mountain of fries, actually. The portions were enormous! The fries were a bit thicker than what I prefer, but underneath the mountain of fries I was able to find some smaller crispy bits. 

Anyways, since the server had such high praise for their steak, my friend ordered the Steak Sandwich - striploin served on a Panini topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and green onion mayo with a side of fries ($9.50). On paper, this sounded exactly the same as what I had ordered. Surprisingly it was incredibly bland. Not recommended. If you're feeling something with steak in it, skip the sandwich and go for the burrito.

Like I said, this experience left me feeling a little undecided about Utopia. A hit and a miss."}
{"text":"Nothing much can be added to the praise.
An amazing 'Utopian Burger' with eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms - goat, swiss, and cheddar cheese - with a massive side of beautiful onion rings. 

A rare find."}
{"text":"Space:

Looks modest from the street, but it's pretty nice inside, and not as tight as it looks (though it looks tight).  I was first drawn in via the large open air window in the front.  Often, when I come here, I sit at the bar.  It's central located, but never in the way of the staff or other customers.

There is a very nice patio in the back, which I did not even realize existed until my second visit.  Incognito!

Service:

Great.  Friendly staff who give excellent food-related advice and recommendations.  In fact, it was a bartender here who first recommending KLB Raspberry Wheat to me when I asked what beer I should have.  I've never looked back.

Food:

It's great.  Boasting a wide variety of very tasty burgers and burritos -- as well as, of course, less heart-attack-inducing fare -- makes this place an instant win in my books.  The burgers quickly become delicious catastrophes on your plate -- which all good burgers should.

Rating:

Five las estrellas.  I love the people working here, the atmosphere, and, importantly, the food."}
{"text":"Two simple words. 

Veggie souvlaki.

Soy protein on a skewer garnished with spices, cooked to perfection, served Greek style, in a pita with tzatziki.  If you add the hot sauce they bring to the table it's borderline orgasmic.

I love the back patio. Toronto hipsters at their best. 

The service is stellar. When our waiter inadvertently brought out the wrong beer, in the true spirit of Canadiana, he apologized profusely. 

Take the pickiest eater in the world here and he/she will find something to love.... for breakfast, lunch AND dinner. 

Well, except for that friend of mine who was on some sort of 'dietary cleanse,\" but she doesn't count. 

Easy on the wallet and located in the heart of Little Italy so you can grab drinks afterwards or go for a stroll. 

At peak hours the line-up is plenty. 

It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Utopia is known to serve good burgers, burritos, salads, and their not so pricey beers! Although I have only got the chance to order their burgers and nachos most of the time, b/c their menu is quite big and many to choose from. 

I had their staple burger: Utopia! Burger meat with grilled eggplant, roasted red pepper, zucchini, with feta cheese and cheddar. The bun was massive! The burger did taste a bit dry for me, and the bun was so big that I only manage to fit half the burger in my mouth. There were lots of fries which is optional if you wanna get charged extra. For the price you pay, this place is a good place to dine with an open view no window.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Cute place with great atmosphere, delicious food, great service, reasonable prices, great location. What more can you ask for?! I really think I found my utopia.

They have deals every weekday, check them out on the website! Also, their specials are written on a chalkboard near the front."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and I LOVED it!!!
Great atmosphere, great location and the food is absolutely delicious!!!
Really good service too!

I'm a bit of a tough case... being a strict vegetarian with a fish allergy, and they more than accommodated me. Utopia has a huge menu with a variety of different food. I went with 2 other people and everyone loved everything :)

I can't wait to go back! 

Maybe this weekend? :)"}
{"text":"Fun, casual and longstanding. Great place to have on College St.  I've always liked the fries and salad.."}
{"text":"Utopia is, hands down, my favourite food in Toronto.

I struggle to walk by it without running in to get the vegetarian souvlaki and vegetarian poutine. Which is troublesome because I lived in the hood for 5 years and my veggie poutine/souvlaki addiction was starting to show in the waistline....

Whether you do or do not eat meant, this restaurant is great. It's amazing to go with a group of friends who are vegan/vegetarian/meatatarians and know that everyone will find something they love.

HOWEVER...

The service is atrocious. Don't bother asking for no onions. They will forget. Don't bother asking for ketchup. It will not make it to your table before your fries are cold. The service is so bad in fact, that when we went with my boyfriends parents, they flat out forgot his parents order. We had to tell them THREE TIMES (after my bf and I got food) that they had most certainly order full meals for themselves. That's not the first time that's happened while I'm there.

But I guess that says something about their food. Because I work in service, I find it terribly annoying to be around shit service. But their food is so good that I over look it for the souvlaki."}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation from a dude that I work with, and have been coming back since.

This place has a pretty hip, relaxed atmosphere and decor. The staff are young, cool and very nice. The menu consists of mainly sandwiches, Mexican fare and BURGERS! The burgers are what I come for, and they offer a variety that ranges in toppings and choice of burger meat. The burgers are very large, juicy and tasty. The side of fries is also quite generous. They have a concise selection of beers on tap, and they go well with the food. 

This is a great joint for a nice dinner date. The atmosphere and food are fantastic."}
{"text":"Looks like the prices have gotten higher and the wait has gotten longer.  The food's still great--this place is an excellent choice for when you're trying to accommodate both carnivores and vegetarians--and the servers are friendly and prompt, but it takes forever to get a table, and once seated, to get your food.  At least the huge portions justify the wait."}
{"text":"I've been to Utopia many times, but I have never reviewed it. I used to reallly enjoy this place, but I think it's probably more enjoyable in the summer or for take-out only. 

As a vegetarian, I've always been a fan of their menu because you can subsitute crispy soy protein or grilled soy in any burrito. They also have veggie burgers, veggie gravy and soy cheese. 

I've had the plain burrito with grilled soy instead of chicken, the curried chick pea and potato burrito and the white bean/tofu quesadillas. I reallly enjoyed both burritos but I found the quesadillas to be quite bland and boring.  The curried burrito looks like mashed sweet potatoes stuffed inside a quesadilla. It's huge and comes with a side of fabulous mango chutney. The vegetarian burrito comes with fake sausage-like meat. Like other reviewers have mentioned, they have a killer hot sauce. 

The portionsof each are massive and come with a choice of two sides. I recommend the salad. The rice and beans is good, but the burritos/quesadillas are so large and filling, it's really just wasted stomach space. They also make a pretty tasty coleslaw.

The restaurant loses on ambience - it's always packed, the tables are very close together, the tables are picnic furniture, it's freezing in the winter, the heaters go on and off, and when it started snowing, the roof started dripping on me. The service is also extremely poor. It's not just slow, they're just poor servers. Our waiter cleared half the table and then disappeared for about 15 minutes even though we were all obviously done. 

I'd give it four stars in the summer, three in the winter.
I also recommend going early - it's always SO busy."}
{"text":"Kitchen open until 1am. Portions are very large, maybe a bit too large in the way of fries. All the employees were friendly, service was very good. 
Decent priced for what you get. $11 for a lamb burger with goat cheese and so many hand cut fries I couldn't finish. $11.50 for bacon cheddar burger, add avacado for $1 extra again with a ton of fries. Beers and cocktails were $5-6.
With a decent tip we spent $60 for two people.
Lamb burger was a bit dry, lamb is lean but maybe they should have a tomato jam or something to ad some juice to it. Maybe next time I'll add avacado or try a different burger.
I would go back. Place is small, so is great for takeout or groups of 4 or less. 

They loose a star because their main way of ventilation is to have the big front bay window open and the location next door has a small fence which every two minutes someone new is leaning on having a smoke blowing it right into Utopia. Utopia should put up signs that smoking is not permitted infront of their establishment between certain hours."}
{"text":"In my search for an amazing Burger, I had the luck to come by Utopia after the recommendation of a friend.

Their specialty Utopia Burger is an addiction. Grilled eggplant, zucchini, sautéed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, with a delicious patty -- My craving wakes up every time I think about it!

Their other sides: Fries, Poutine, Quesadillas, and nachos are nothing to scoff at either.

Service isn't always awesome, with long waits for drinks or simply getting your order. 

Nonetheless, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to this place with low expectations. Afterall, how good can a mexican resto be in TO?! I've been spoiled by the authentic close to south of the border mexican food in san diego, so I prepared myself to be surprised.

When I got there, my friends were already seated on the patio. The menu was very diverse. From salads, to sandwiches, poutine, burgers, and burritos. I opted for the chicken and grilled shrimp burrito with a side of fries and salad. I especially requested avocado for an extra 1$. The order was 13$ + 1$.

The food came and it did not disappoint. The burrito was to die for. Very tasty and succulent. Hard to imagine it came from a cramped small kitchen and two chefs which you pass by on your way to the back patio.

The wait staff was busy but attentive. We got water and drinks prompty. Even our to go order was quickly processed.

The quality was up to my standards. I don't think you could go wrong with any menu items. Their burgers were of generous portion made from fresh sirloin. 

My friend got some soup and burrito to go ($9 just for the burrito with no sides). Apparently they have really good sweet potato soup. At this time, their soup of the day was gazpacchio (?).

I would definitely go back to try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"I was really underwhelmed.  Everything on the menu looked decent, and the dish itself did too.  

First- the dish was too packed with food (a small dish).  Very hard to actually eat.  This seems like a good thing, but the food was mostly bland.  My grilled chicken wrap was soaked in sauces on the inside, and yet I could hardly taste a thing.  The fried were decent, but the salad was just basic mixed greens (no additions). 

 I'm getting real tired of places using only mixed greens as some sort of fancy dish.  There needs to be some other chopped veggies in it.  Even iceberg lettuce comes with more effort.

Service was a solid 'mediocre'.  Though she didn't once ask how 'everything was tasting'. I wonder why..."}
{"text":"I thought we would check this place out because of the great reviews on Yelp.  I was looking forward to trying the veg poutine, as well as few other items, as we checked out the menu online ahead of time.

The place was busy, but no line outside.  We got seated at the only table left...a small two seater by the cook's area.  Service was so bad, we had to leave after sitting for 15 min with our menus and never being asked if we would like to order drinks.  Waitress was a bitch, maybe just an off day for her or that time of the month, whatever the case she rudley told us (when we asked if we could possibly get a table up front by the window when one opened up) that no table would be opening up anytime soon as everyone had just gotten their menu...WOW!  We had already been sitting their a good 5 or 10 min and we were the last to be seated so I guess everyone had been sitting for quite some time with their menus as well.

My hubby was hungry as hell and a cold beer or even a glass of water would have sufficed until we could get some food on our table.

The music in this tiny restaurant was blaring a little too loudly for such a small, cramped area.  And I was not crazy about being able to watch the two cooks prepare the food from our table...they looked like total jokers and I'm not sure I'd want my food prepared or handled by them.

Won't go back."}
{"text":"Utopia is a great name for this place, a gem nestled cozily in Little Italy.  One great fact is that they offer tons of lovely vegetarian options, which means that you can bring a mixed group of omnivores and veggie people and still keep everyone happy.  Also, I feel like overall the dining experience is that of a slightly higher priced restaurant, which is always a nice surprise.

I know that they have a beautiful varied menu with lots of great choices, but I am cursed with being so in love with one particular dish at the moment that I can't manage to branch out to something different.  Even though there are so many other tempting items on the menu.  Maybe next time?

I tend to go to Utopia in the afternoon, generally a brunchy weekend visit.  I'll usually get a coffee to start and then order the Chicken Club.  I know that sounds so incredibly boring, but honestly it's delicious.  It comes on a slim, tender french stick baguette, chopped into three decent sized portions.   The sandwich comes topped with swiss cheese, deliciously seasoned grilled chicken, bacon, red pepper mayo, salad greens, tomatoes and red onions.  And on the side, some of Utopia's golden crispy perfect fries.  I will usually get a side of the green onion or garlic dill mayo for the fries, and maybe a glass of white wine (because nothing goes better with fries than white wine, lol).  

For the rest of the menu I can only plead ignorance, other than to say my friend ALWAYS gets the veggie chicken burrito and I have tried it and can say that, yes, it is tasty and wow does that veggie chicken taste good!  

The staff are also great, casual but very professional and good at checking in on you.  They're happy to make recommendations too.  In the summer, there's a really nice back patio.  Overall the place is a bit too tiny, but that's part of the coziness and charm of the place - except when you get there at the wrong time and have to wait for a table.

In a word, though, lovely."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I have never had a bad meal.. It's always delicious and is perfect if your vegan/vegetarian and want amazing food!"}
{"text":"I am shocked that this place has the number of stars that it does considering my experience and what people have been only too eager to tell me about THEIR experiences. C'mon people, this is what Yelp's about. 

I have been going to Utopia for years, generally for take-out as I find the service to be sluggish and when this place is hopping (which is around any meal time) it's extremely difficult to hear the person across the table from you. Last night, I dined in (not my first time for this either). My experience was horrifying. Utopia is NOT a utopia!!

I understand when places are having their dinner rush they may not be able to take your order promptly (heck, I WORK in the service industry, I know what it's like), but to not even bring a glass of water for 36 minutes? That is not a difficult service to do for your customers. When we finally ordered (40 minutes after arriving which we were still cool with), we had to wait yet another 20 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. At this point the dinner crowd was gone and we were one of only 3 tables left (one of which was just enjoying a few beverages).

Our plates were delivered and the server was gone before we could even ask for hot sauce. When I looked at my plate I realized that my vegetarian souvlaki (sans taztiki because I'm a vegan who is actually allergic to animal products - an allergy that was shared with the server), had been...
1) Dropped on the floor. That's right. There were actually bits of dirt on my food. 
2) The tortilla was mangled (possibly from the fall).
3) AND it was cold. 
I hailed the server as soon as I saw her and showed her my meal, asking if I could have another one.

\"I guess. Sorry.\" 

She went back to the kitchen with the plate never bothering to ask if there was anything she could bring me to tide me over until my meal was ready. After all, we had been there for about an hour and a half at this point.

ANOTHER 15 minutes later, my plate arrived again. This time with Tzatiki sauce on it. There were no servers around to hail (ours had seemed to vanish) so I took it to the front to tell them that my meal had been made incorrectly and I couldn't eat it. Once again, I mentioned that I had notified my server that I had a food allergy which is why I DIDN'T want the sauce. The girl at the front just looked at me and stated that she hadn't taken my order, what did I expect HER to do about it and basically gave some pretty shitty attitude. 

Maybe you could give me the correct meal complimentary at this point, give me a side of some sort to tide me over and be polite. Just sayin'.

At this point I had decided that this hassle really wasn't worth it anymore and I no longer felt like enjoying a nice meal...I wasn't going to get one anyway. We decided to leave, but not before the girl at the front stomped back to dish out more attitude and sarcasm. When we tried to settle up my friend's meal with our assigned server we got major attitude from her as well because she didn't take debit at the back of the restaurant. Obviously no tip!

Thanks a lot Utopia for such a bloody \"great\" experience! I will NOT be going back and I will make sure to tell everyone what a horrible dining experience this was."}
{"text":"Utopia is my best friend.  We're best friends.  I've never had a bad dining experience in all the times I've gone.  Utopia and I sit around, drink wine or beer and tell amusing little stories and we might make fun of people who act douchey in non-douchey situations.  No wonder why Utopia's stuck around for so long.  Utopia can be your best friend too.  Go now.  Have their melted brie with raspberry couli.  Eat their burgers and salads.  Laugh and be merry."}
{"text":"Been a fan for years. Located in one of the cooler parts of Toronto.  I've only had the vegetarian fare, but it's great. Some of the best fries in the city and the veggie gravy is a bonus. The patio in the back has atmosphere.
Tends to get busy during peak times so be prepared. Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Staff does fluctuate from time to time but I always order my lamb burger with onion fries. Love it and I always use their tangy sauce and I mix it with ketchup to make a good kicker sauce for my burger and fries. Everyone that I brought tried the mixture and they thought it was good. 

Price for food is reasonable, service is good if it's not busy or under staffed. Only complaint is during peak times when they are extremely busy, service does slow down."}
{"text":"Always a pretty solid plate at Utopia for a reasonable price. Don't expect to be blown away though. I find the service friendly enough. I haven't had a burrito here yet but the burgers and sandwiches are tasty (Though the steak sandwich was a letdown the one time I ordered it) Good fries and the free poutine upgrade on Tuesdays is pretty tasty but afterwards I'm always thinking...why? Why did I do that to my body??!! WHY???? 

The only complaint I have is why did they put that big stupid tv in the back? Is it not bad enough that hipsters can't have a fucking meal with another person without glancing at their phone every minute? Do we now really need to watch CP24 (bah!) constantly? Conversation can be a wonderful thing, lose that damn tv!"}
{"text":"The variety on this menu is endless. The patio is where u wanna sit. It is so nice and cozy, at night its the perfect spot for u and ur friends or a nice romatic spot that a couple can chill. Food, where to begin.lol the japanese style fried chicken, is a must try. Its a little dry, but it really makes up for in flavour.  The crab cakes, wow! It just melts in ur mouth and it actually has real crab meat pieces. This is what I look for in a crab cake :) oh man, there poutine selection is big, and I just went with lamb cause come on.lol its lamb! Nothing here over powered the lamb and it was a very good blend of meat cheese and Potatoe. As my main meal I got a lamb burrito. The rice and peas, was a little dry and not so much in flavour. The coleslaw was more of a summer blend, which is not particularly my favorite, since I like mayo.lol but the burrito, dam... It was good and and big portion too. This place is near UofT and if I went to school there, easily one of my lunch spots. Service was at par.lol no complaints there.lol"}
{"text":"Seriously great burgers, with so many mix and match topping and sauce options. Also great to see that they are one of the few places I've found that sell Bellwoods and Burdock beers by the bottle. Recommended."}
{"text":"Talk about the best tasting burritos I've had so far. (sorry burrito Boyz but you're still my #1 2am fix :-) ) I definitely plan on coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place is different than most pubs, in fact I'd hesitate to call it a pub at all, but it had average service, great food, and an agreeable atmosphere.

I'd advise sitting in the back of the restaurant, during either season, and ordering whatever you see on the menu that sounds appealing to you. All of it looks, smells, and tastes great. I particularly recommend the bison burger."}
{"text":"4.5*

I went on a very busy Thursday night after hearing great things about the hamburgers.

And boy did they deliver!
I chose the regular burger with bacon and fries. I don't think I will have to eat for another week!!

The burger was cooked to perfection, pair that with the fresh lettuce, tomato, 3 sauces, cheese and the bacon and it was heaven!

I could only manage to get through 3 quarters of the burger and fries, before my stomach said no more, even though I wanted to keep going it was that good!

Only taking marks off due to slow service, but they can be forgiven as it was at capacity with minimal waiting staff."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but the food was good and the portions were enormous. 

My table of four were early so we avoided the rush of people that seemed to swarm in at 6:30 sharp. Before we knew it the place was full, and with that comes slightly slower service. 

I had the veggie poutine app, and it was massive. A veggie burger second with a \"side salad\" that would rival most meal sized greens. Another in our party had a side of fries with his burger and it was equally as massive as my salad. My boyfriend had a burrito with a side of black bean rice and sesame slaw. The burrito and rice were great, but next time we'll opt for a salad in place of the slaw. It was just a bit too sesame-y for us. 

The next time my boyfriend and I will get one plate and share it."}
{"text":"my most favourite meal in the whole wide world - a big fat juicy greasy budget with oozing melted cheese with a plate of sky high fries - fit for my last supper! 

I've been dreaming about going to Utopia - have heard such GREAT things about it. So this trip was highly anticipated and long long overdue - given my love for burgers especially.

Sad to report that the visit was disappointing perhaps because my expectations were high - only for the food really, i hadn't heard much else about anything else at Utopia so i was there for just the food. And i have to say i've had better burgers in the city, unfortunately.

Starters - the place is adorable. A wonderful little place with a huge back patio which i wouldn't have known existed till i saw all this activity going there. When we arrived there were only two tables at the front so we missed the patio. The service was friendly but VERY slow. That may have been because there were only 2 cooks there in a very tiny kitchen which was in the main room - it was fascinating to see all these meals come out of that small a space. I kept saying there should've been at least one more chef but to be honest i cannot imagine where he or she would fit - they would have to overflow on to our table - the closest to the kitchen.

I ordered the Utopia burger - i figured it would have to good as it is the signature and my husb ordered the kissing cousins burger.
Utopia burger with beef you get a choice of meats, chicken, beef or lamb - it had a load of toppings grilled veggies - papers and EGGPLANT (my other most favourite food). The burger itself wasn't as juicy as i would have liked and bun was too much bread and not toasted at all - i like mine toasted.

The kissing cousins burger was lamb with a goat cheese topping. Creamy topping, juicier burger but still missing the umph. There is nothing extraordinary about the fries either - in fact food truck fries are better.

Overall, the ambience was great for this burger joint. the menu was spectacular and large - most people seemed to be ordering burritos so i guess i'll be trying those for the next visit. As for the burger - i will have to give it another try, another time."}
{"text":"We've all heard it before...

\"You're alone on a deserted island, with only one possible food for the rest of your life. What food would you choose?\"

Well, friends, Utopia is the correct answer. 

As a vegetarian, I am incredibly impressed with all of their options, and my carnivorous friends have never had any complaints. 

Their nachos come on top of a giant tortilla shell, which means you can fold up all your left over toppings and have ANOTHER meal. Their burritos outperform anything on the menu and I am hard pressed to find another combination of flavours that satisfy me like a Utopia burrito.  

They even serve Dad's Root Beer (might I suggest you try it with a shot of Jåger).


Overall, the food is what makes this place. You will have to wait for a table if you go for dinner or brunch (if you get a table right away, consider yourself lucky), but it is well worth it. 

The three most commonly used words amongst all of my friends? 

\"I want Utopia.\""}
{"text":"I once LOVED Utopia, but in the last few years the quality of food has gone down tremendously. Before they would use only chicken breast in their burritos and now it's filled with what looks like scraps from someone's leftovers."}
{"text":"I'm a simple gal when it comes to food. I love chicken and I love cheese, so its no surprise that once I finally got a look at the menu I ordered the chicken goat cheese burrito.  I was all in for tasting some yummy cheap goodness since I heard so much about Utopia.  Little did I know that I'd be sitting there for almost an hour before the food arrived.  While the food was gloooorious, I'm pretty sure that my opinion was influenced by the fact that I was in semi-starvation mode and would have even resorted to eating my napkin if I had waited any longer.  With that being said, I'm willing to give this place another shot, but will be better prepared for the possibility of being subject to starvation mode again."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  It's one of the few places that I always recommend.   Always lots of food, super tasty, and reasonably priced.  The only negative is that place is the tiny places and barely any elbow room.   But it's about the food.  And this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before and live in Toronto then I urge you to go! I'll even come with you.

We'd seen the place advertised in tourist guides that said it offers some of the best food in the city. I'm usually skeptical of this kind of stuff. This time it hit the nail on the head.

FOOD was amazing. I had the South Western Burger and the bun was immense plus the filling inside it. The fries sealed the deal.

BEER prices are fair and more than cheap enough to stay for a few after you've eaten.

ATMOSPHERE is jovial and the back patio is a hidden gem along College Street.

Make sure you get down here!"}
{"text":"Fail-proof nachos, good poutine and good burritos. Laid back atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the hype is about.  We went this evening for dinner and were disappointed.  If people are queued up for up to a 30min wait then definitely this place should be worth it.  I should've known otherwise because while they don't take reservations, you can't even leave your name once you've queue up.  Thirty minute wait, sure I'll just stand here in the cold instead of possibly waiting at the tiny bar or better yet, grab a quick drink down the way.  No, you or someone in your party MUST wait in the queue like an ass.  

We finally are seated and after seeing the enormous dishes going by of basic fare - burgers and burritos with mounds of fries - we were starving.  The bartender recommended the burgers, including the veg burger.  Now, I love me a well made veggie burger, one that's lightly crisp on the outside, hand formed with little chunks oddly sticking out.  But what I received was an overpriced Gardenburger with side of avocado.  The side of fries were enough for two people.  But they were slightly over fried.  At least they had malt vinegar.  And pear cider, otherwise I'd give it 1 star.  Everyone else had mediocre meals, exceptions were for the merguez and brie (!) and veggie nachos.  

Based on what other reviews have said, perhaps this was an off day but I wouldn't give it a second chance.   

One of the staff said it had been around for 18 years.  Back in NYC, with food like this,  not even 2months."}
{"text":"I love Utopia and have pretty much made most of my pals addicted to it as well.

After growing up a vegetarian where my menu options always seemed to be salad, pasta, or a cardboardish veggie burger I was overwhelmed/overjoyed at having a choice of the whole menu at Utopia.
They will basically make anything on the menu vegetarian, vegan or with whatever meat you prefer, which is rad. Plus the price is right - burgers and burritos are all in the $8-13 range with fries or salad, so even my stingy pals are stoked on the quality/ amt of food.

Best veggie burgers I've had in the city - and there's like 12 options to choose from. My personal fave is the Southwest veggie with guacamole - yum!

Usually my biggest dilemma is what to choose because I'm not used to all the options. I've probably been to Utopia about 7-10 times and i alternate between a veggie burger and something else just so I try as much as possible ha. I've never had a bad meal here, although once a friend got a burrito that was a bit burnt, but they replaced it with a fresh one.

The other great thing about Utopia is that it's great for anyone - it's the perfect place when my Albertan meat-eating family comes to visit because they love the regular burgers and meaty burritos. A place where everyone in my family can eat and not be disappointed is a rare find ha. And it's a cute little place in a nice neighbourhood that doesn't sketch out mom, which is an added bonus.

Biggest complaint about Utopia - the size of the place! I wish I could go with big groups of friends, but because the place is so small and so popular it's best to go with 4 people or less. And waiting in the line is a bit of pain, but it's worth it.

It would probably be a cute date spot especially for lunch or brunch, although beware looking like a neanderthal as you shovel in the yummy food ;)"}
{"text":"Been here many times and always enjoyed the food.   The portion they give if very generous.   The price is pretty good for the portion they give.  My favorite is the fried chicken avocado burrito.   I recommend come early as it tends to get busy."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great burritos, great salads!  I am sure the rest of the varied menu is terrific as well, but I never get any further!

This is my go to place when I am craving a great Greek salad.  A Greek salad shouldn't be a hard thing to find  downtown right?  but sadly it is...

Utopia delivers with just the right ratio of lettuce to tomato to feta to olive with great seasoning and dressing.  Perfection!

This is a pretty awesome place to go with a group of particular eaters.  Loads of vegetarian and healthy options while also offering something for the gravy, fried and meaty set as well.  Everyone's a winner!

Tables up front are packed in pretty tight, but cummon that's part of the fun.  This place is hustlin and bustlin and busy with tables turning over thanks to an experienced and more than capable serving staff.  Wait your turn and you will be justly rewarded with a great meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try some place different for brunch this past Sunday.  We ventured to Little Italy and noticed Utopia had a near full house - always a good sign, we thought.  The atmosphere seemed nice and we got a good table near the window.  Once the surly, unsmiling (miserable) waiter came to our table - the good feelings ended.  It was 1:05 pm when we ordered our meal (bacon and eggs).  At 1:45 we still had not been served.  I finally went up to the waiter and asked for a status. He snarled that one of the dishes was ready and he was waiting for the other.  I went back to the table and we waited another few minutes.  All the time, the one dish was sitting on the ledge (not heated) getting cold.  The waiter then took a phone call and that was it.  For the first time in my life - I threw down a $5 dollar bill for the coffee we had been served and we stalked out.  By then we were famished and went into the first place we could find - Cafe Diplomatico.  The breakfast was only so-so - but the service was fast and incredibly pleasant.  One more thing - we also noticed that we were not the only one's unhappy with our experience and meal at Utopia - most of the people were only eating half of their meals.  One of the worst restaurant experiences of our lives!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service, mediocre food. Really doubting how clean this place is, a cook was on her phone with her gloves on (yum). Giving two stars for the vegan options and for the decent fries."}
{"text":"Judging from all the reviews it's going to be a hit or miss based on what you order and from whom you are ordering it from.  

Service:  5/5 

As soon as I walked in the door to a pretty packed dining area I was immediately greeted by our server, Signe.   She was obviously very busy, however; she managed to get us a table, menus and a glass of water.   As soon as my guest and I made our decision on food choices, Signe was there to take out order with a delightful smile.   The table was clean and shortly after placing our orders, utensils were brought over.   During our meal, she checked on us to ensure that we had everything and that everything was to our satisfaction.   

Food: 2/5 

My guest ordered the homemade burger with fries.  I ordered the Bison Burger with onion rings.   Portion wise they are good size plates.  There was no doubt we were not walking out of here hungry.  However; the French fries were lukewarm as we're the onion rings and the Bison burger was overcooked.  It was dry and crumbly on the palate.  Thankfully the condiments added some taste and moisture to this meal.   We finished our meal with a chocolate espresso cheese cake.  One piece will definitely feed 2 people.  It was tasty and presented well.  

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place.  It's got a very cozy feel to it and is a great place if you are on a date.   

The price isn't too bad.  $35.48  two burgers, fries and onion rings with desert.   

However; if you are in the mood for burger and fries, I'm gonna recommend Harvey's.   They make much better burgers, their fries and onion rings are hot when they are served, and they are at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Went Rouge by offering fries or greens with each dish instead if their cajun rice which was their differentiator. Now clumped into the middle and unnoticeable offerings of College Street..."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. There are plenty of other options in the neighbourhood. I ordered the daily special steak sandwich and it was terrible. The nachos sucked too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch with a friend. I ordered the omlette of the day and she got the standard breakfast. Everything was standard breakfast fare but just a little too bland. Service is friendly and fuss free."}
{"text":"whole back room space
huge nachos
good appetizers (karaage is great, brie-filled pastries are good, crab cakes are alright but have great sauce)"}
{"text":"Quality spot that lived up to Yelp billing. Service was ok, but nothing brilliant. It's tough to rate a place like this that doesn't have one unique dish that it's defined by. I got the Smoked Benny which was pretty sound and definitely filing enough."}
{"text":"Awesome value.

Great for your vegetarian friends, too. 

Tasty. Be sure to load on that orange hot sauce on the table.

Burritos are the way to go....although the salmon quinoa is interesting sounding...it can be somewhat dry.

The back patio is usually packed- so go to dinner a littler earlier than usual."}
{"text":"We came here on the recomendation of my friend's hunky eye doctor. **sigh** Who said he loved the burgers at this place, and since we were in the area and hungry,we decided to give it a shot. 

It is a rather small place, but it has a really nice patio out back which we sat on this beautiful and sweltering hot day. There was only one server for the whole place, yet the service wasn't too slow and she was attentive and friendly.  We decided on the crispy chicken and avocado burrito, and the Utopia burger and this was the veredict:

Utopia burger- tender, moist and delicious! It comes with the works (tomato,pickle,onion,green onion mayo) plus 3 cheeses ( I think they were asiago, cheddar and havarti) plus grilled veggies (eggplant,zuchinni and red peppers). It was huge! I had a hard time taking a bite because it was so loaded with toppings, I could barely get my mouth around it, and it came with crispy, golden french fries.

Crispy chicken avocado burrito- very good also, but the leafy greens  in it got soggy from all the sauce and mustard seed mayo it had in it, and I really don't like soggy lettuce. Otherwise, the chicken was crispy and had good flavour, and the avocado was creamy and delicious, all in all a really good combination. The burrito comes with rice and beans and your choice of either slaw or salad. I got the salad and it was good, though nothing exciting. Just greens with a balsamic vinagrette, the rice and beans were bland, and I couldn't bring myself to eat them.

The servings are really big, I cant immagine ever being able to eat a whole burrito, with rice,beans and salad. There are lots of options on the menu including meal sized salads, quesadillas, sandwiches, and a huge list of burritos and burgers. They also have a board with specials. 

I'm excited to come back here and try some of the other things on their menu, maybe one day we'll catch the hunky doctor here during his lunch break :)"}
{"text":"What happened to Utopia? This used to be one of my fave lunch spots on College St. They had the best food and wonderful wait staff but yesterday my experience was not so great. They have changed the menu and the food we got was bland and the salad was drenched in a tasteless oil.  Don't think I will return to this spot I used to love so much."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.  I went with a friend to check out what the big whoop is.  I had eggplant parmesan burrito with their sesame seed cole slaw.  Very filling but I found the cole slaw a bit ho hum (not much flavour).   We waited a while for our food and our hostess did not check up on us but I guess that is to be expected because this place is so busy.  The hostess seats you and takes your order but it's actually someone from the kitchen that plops your order on your table."}
{"text":"Great veggie options! We had the veggie chicken burrito and veggie souvlaki! Definitely try their green hot sauce.  I believe they make it in-house."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**

Nothing says \"middle of spring\" like lunch on College, on a Monday with friends. 

Utopia's a cute little place. I found the staff just attentive enough and consistent with bringing our food out on time.

I REALLY liked my meal. I had a lamb sausage-and-brie burrito (which actually looked more like a wrap). Mmm - SO tasty. Also loved the rice and peas (yum! almost like mom's!), and the generous helping of freshly made coleslaw.

I also had a lava cake for dessert. Or rather, had a third of a lava cake. I actually thought there'd be ooey-gooey chocolate in the middle. But it was firm all the way through, and super-rich. Plus, I had no room after the \"burrito\", so I'm savin' it for later!

The pricing also seemed fair: my lunch entree was $12, and the lava cake was $5.

The only minor quibble: because it's such a small establishment, the tables were close together. As a result, I almost felt like I was being a little loud/obnoxious to the two young women sitting about a foot away from me. I know there's nothing that can be done about that. Maybe I'll have to  come back here when the back patio's open.

It's probably because I went for lunch after 1 p.m., but I honestly have no complaints about this place. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Eh.  I went here for lunch based on someone's recommendation.  I went online first to view the menu and was excited about all of the options that looked tasty, but I didn't decide what to get until arriving.   Chicken and goat cheese burrito?  It sounded delicious so I got it to-go and came back twenty minutes later.  The front of the restaurant is rather cramped, but seemed like a good place to people-watch.  You have to make your way past the tight table sot order at the bar and whenever I was there (however brief) there were always people cramped at the bar.  That being said, I've heard that the patio is quite nice and I didn't actually sit down to eat, just an FYI.  Honestly, I was hoping to be blown away by this food after a grueling few hours attempting to put together some furniture.  I was a little disappointed.  The chicken was quite good and the burrito itself wasn't bad, but I was really hoping that the goat cheese would be more prominent.  I couldn't really tasted it, it was more just a texture of mushy substance in the burrito rather than part of the flavor, which was a bit of a disappointment.  

Update: Decided to head here for the veggie nachos on the advice of aforementioned \"friend\", which did not disappoint! If I could bump it up a half a star I would, but I can't bring myself to give it another star based on my previous experience."}
{"text":"Cute little patio at the back. It's covered so it's good for all year round. Decided to come here bc of the positive reviews. 
Food was regular, we had a quick burger there. Fries were yummy. 
Overall, its a super casual and chill place for chatting and hanging out for dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Really good prices, huge portions, dope beer selection, home-made hot sauce, and a surprising amount of space. What's not to love?

I came here on a Saturday morning and had their breakfast burger - which is just a regular burger with an egg. It's not as good/unique as Grapefruit Moon's, but a solid greasy thing that I immensely enjoyed.

I've heard great things about their nachos - thank you Bunz community - so I will be back. According to other recent reviews, food quality has tapered recently, so I'll be cautious when I do"}
{"text":"Had lunch here not long ago and it was delicious. Upon entering the little space, you know you're in for something good otherwise why would all these people be here? 

My friend and I got the last table before a huge lunch rush came flowing in and out. It took us a little while to get situated with the large menu, get our drinks etc. But the waitress definitely redeemed herself when an incredibly loud, obnoxious man came in and sat at the table beside us. In a moment of sheer fate another table opened up and we could not move fast enough. When I caught the waitress' eye to indicate our movement, after a millisecond she just gave me a knowing nod and smile in a way that said, \"Yes, I feel your pain and I'll get all the goods to the right place\". 

Now let's get to the goods. Shrimp burrito! Perfectly cooked shrimp, melty cheese, great spices going on and a perfect portion for me. I wiped my plate clean, the black bean rice AND the salad. Both additions were fresh and great to eat when having a burrito break. My friend's Mediterranean burger was juicy and delicious with it's tzatziki, feta and other toppings. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again, I feel like the name \"Utopia\" is a lot of pressure to place on the shoulders of one restaurant. Don't get me wrong, Utopia is really, really good. Just saying utopian is pretty strong word to be throwing around. Go, eat some heavenly things."}
{"text":"We have been (mostly happy) customers of utopia for many years but my most recent experience compels me to warn others. First off; cockroaches. Second of all, in their new menu their good life salad is $12 for a large, which is about half the size of the old one. Third of all the server is smug, unapologetic and kind of annoying.

Last time i went she brought my companion the completely wrong dish and \"oh, the kitchen must've got it wrong\". Okay fine. It had already been a long time at this point so the server brings us my friend's fries in a basket. Half hour later - half an hour, two other tables full - the sandwich is slammed down on our table without apology. Nothing is comp'd, my salad with added chicken and cost almost $20 and was small and had barely any of the toppings it used to. I won't be going back; slow, pestilent, condescending and now overpriced? What happened?!"}
{"text":"While some say Utopia is hit and miss, I've always found it to be on point. J'adore the patio in the back where you can enjoy a nice day and tuck into one of their gourmet burritos. The selections are plentiful and I often find myself humming and hawing about whether to get the chicken goat cheese burrito or the the \"Goucho,\" which just happens to be packed with marinated grilled beef and onions, sauteed mushrooms, feta cheese, and topped with a zesty chimichurri sauce. Drool. The fun doesn't stop at the burritos. Utopia also boasts a wide variety of fresh salads and homemade burgers that you can wash down with any one of their chilled beers or cocktails if you felt so inclined. The menu is tantalizing, the staff are friendly, and you could very well leave feeling slightly euphoric...or should I say utopic?"}
{"text":"I headed to Utopia Cafe & Grill with a few friends for lunch.  When we walked in, we were instantly greeted by the staff and directed to their heated back patio!  How awesome to be seated in a patio environment in the winter.

Menu

Extensive - they have various offerings on upscale pub food.  This is a great place for vegetarians, they had many veggie dishes.

Food

Appetizer

Veggie nachos - they were great, huge portion!  The three of us could not finish what they brought out.  The extra guacamole we got was fabulous, we could not get enough of it.  I would order this again!

Entree

Bison Burger - huge burger, juicy and right ratio of toppings to meat.  I got half fries and half coleslaw with my burger.  The fries were great, perfectly seasoned.  Coleslaw was ok, on the bland side.  I would try their other burger options my next visit.

My friends were great satisfied with their meals.  One of my friends had a gluten allergy and the waitress offered options my friend options on their menu.

Service

Great service.  No complaints.

Overall, Utopia is a great food and service.  I will be back for sure in the future!"}
{"text":"Ein großartiges kleines Burger Restaurant mitten auf der College Street.
U-Bahn Station Bloor Street, dann noch ne ganze Ecke zu laufen, einfach die College Street runter, lohnt sich aber wirklich.
Sehr leckere Burger, Pommes, Fajitas etc. und die Dips sind einmalig und außergewöhnlich (Garlic-Lemongras, wo gibt's denn sowas?:) )
Vorher unbedingt reservieren, ist wirklich sehr klein dort, kaum 30 Plätze meiner Einschätzung nach, mit großen Gruppen also eher ungeeignet.
Ansonsten: Uneingeschränkt empfehlenswert, wenn der große Burger-Hunger kommt!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night when the place had only one other couple in it but it quickly filled up after we arrived with other couples and larger groups.  Everything on the menu sounds pretty appetizing and I settled on sweet potato and grilled chicken quesadilla.  I wasn't expecting the serving sizes to be so large but I was brought a plate overflowing with food.  The quesadilla itself was large but also the sides served with it plentiful, rice & beans with sesame seed coleslaw.  The quesadilla was delicious although I wish there was more chicken in it and the sides were mediocre.  You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck here."}
{"text":"This place is indeed a vegetarian-friendly utopia. 
One of my favorite spots for a burrito, poutine, and half a liter of wine!

I love this place!

It's easy to understand why this place is so popular.
With the dim lighting, it's casual, comfortable, but still nice enough to take a date (well, if you can eat a burrito neatly, that's a pretty special skill).  

The menu is so extensive, there's something for everyone! 
I didn't even know there could be so many types of burritos.
Also, there are vegetarian options galore!

The poutine is tasty, the fries were perfectly crispy, the gravy salty.
The gravy is good for a vegetarian gravy!

I had the crispy salmon burrito stuffed with salmon, onions, lettuce, etc.
Sesame slaw isn't too creamy and a bit tart which is perfect.

This place is my go-to place on College for a casual meal!
I could go for a grilled eggplant burrito right now..."}
{"text":"Have been to this spot twice with different people and it was great both times. The prices are reasonable, the service is spot on, the menu is extensive, the portions are huge (either make sure you're super hungry or prepare to bring some home with you) and the food is so yummy!  I can vouch for the mushroom salad, the mushroom, pesto and goat cheese panini (you have to get those fries!) and the sangria but I doubt there's anything on the menu that isn't amazing. The only thing I wish is that the draft beer menu was larger and included some regular beers. I would recommend sitting at the back as there seems to be more space."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with a group of friends. I'm happy one of them recommended us to come, we had a good time- such a casual relaxing place to hangout on a Friday evening close to all the action of College Street. Plus the waiter was super chill. 

 While it was recommended to have the burger, I kept seeing people ordering the nachos and I just had to have some. Huge portion with a good amount of cheese and toppings. And of course we had to wash it down with some local beers.  One friend had the chicken pesto panino and the other the fish tacos. Both were happy with their choices. 

It was getting busy around 8pm, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I've been to Utopia a number of times, and each and every time I have had a good meal (nachos are good, burritos are very good, but the burgers are best).  My only complaint is that the service can be very slow, even when they are not busy.  Also, the last time I was there, my friend and I watched a cockroach make its way up the wall beside our table on the back patio.  We pointed out our unexpected guest to the owner/waitress, and she took our names and e-mail addresses to enter us in a contest for a free meal - ha ha!  Good recovery!  Never did win the contest though - ha!"}
{"text":"Food was so-so. Service was good. It's the usual brunch fare for the prices they charge. I tried the chicken and waffles which was not good. I might have enjoyed Eggos and KFC chicken a little more. The crispy Brie with raspberry coulis was really tasty. I would recommend 3 order of that per person."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of our favourites to go to. We ordered online a few weeks ago, and tried to get in contact regarding our disappointing meal (Burned black nachos, packaging that turned all into a soggy mush upon arrival, poor presentation and boxes of sloppy food). Our email was kind, and just offered a delivery packaging suggestion that would potentially avoid ruining the quality of the food offered.

We received no response at all. We were not looking for a discount, refund or anything, just acknowledgement that we received a disappointing, expensive \"meal\".

We will not order online again, and have not set foot in the restaurant since (We made frequent visits in the past).

Overall, the food is good, but our bad customer relations experience has turned us away from ever wanting to go back."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted in this review. We recently visited Utopia on Friday night and while the food was good, the service by far was the worst I have experienced in Toronto. We ordered 3 items, which the waitress forgot 2 of them. Imagine going out for dinner with 3 people and only one person gets their meal. We ordered the nachos, which was the waitress forgot initially but rang them up after we pointed out the mistake when she was bringing out one of the main courses. The nachos were a good but would be better with some fresh veggies to add a different level of flavour. The shrimp burrito was also tasty although the salad was quite wilted. Overall, while the food was good, the service was so bad that I will not visit this place again. Avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"My first visit to Utopia was on a very busy night.  They appear to be one of those places that is always busy, so I had very high expectations.

We were lucky enough to find places at the bar to wait for our table and enjoyed beverages and a light appetizer, while others were squished at the doorway.

I'm glad we were given lots of time with the menu while waiting, as there are way too many good options to choose from.  I was torn between their grilled vegetable sandwich and a good burger, so I combined the two and got the burger topped with grilled vegetables.  The burger was way too big for my appetite and I only got through half of it, but the portion I had was delicious.  The burger was juicy and they were generous with the vegetables.  The fries on the side were also good, but I hardly had room for them.

Very reasonable prices and no complaints about the service.  I will be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My only real complaint about Utopia is that it's not close enough to my house.

It's casual and cozy, and it's the perfect place to take a friend (veggie or meat-eater) for lunch or brunch.  It's open for dinner, too, but I tend to go there more during the day.  I've had many a hangover meal there, in fact.....

The best thing about the menu is the substitute option: vegetarians and vegans can sub in soy-based protein (breaded faux chicken or grilled soy nugget thingies, like the So Soya stuff), and even soy cheese, for the standard animal products.  And the servers are all very savvy to veggie needs.

If I feel like being reeeally naughty, I order a vegan version of the chicken quesadilla with the grilled soy & soy cheese, and ask for fries instead of the salad & rice and beans.  I'm not saying it's a healthy meal by any means, but holy crap is it good!!!

The menu has a lot of unique burrito and sandwich-y type fare, plus meal-sized salads and burgers, etc.  The prices are good and the portions are excellent.  And did I mention that the gravy at Utopia is vegetarian and delicious as hell?!!  I'm not sure if it's vegan....will have to double-check that.  So far, it's been one of those \"don't ask/don't tell\" things for me.  Shhhh....

Also, the bottles of yummy Utopia hot sauce on every table are more-flavour-than-heat, and go well with practically everything.

I've probably eaten at Utopia 50 times (hey - I like what I like!), and the food and service have always been great.  The food does take a little while to prepare, but that's ok by me, since I'm going there for good food, not fast food."}
{"text":"Giant serving and wholesome food.  The prices are actually quite reasonable and the service is spot on.  They don't take reservations and the place can fill up fast so make sure you are ready to wait or go at 430.  

My favourite item is the brie wrap in pastry with raspberry dipping sauce, so yummy.  Definitely great place."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for the first time tonight. We were very happy with our meals.

I had the roasted veggie and goat cheese burrito and he had the buffalo burrito.

My burrito was very good, chock full of grilled veggies and goat cheese. I was actually surprised by the amount of goat cheese as I'm used to places skimping on it.  The rice and beans had a nice kick to them and the salad was tasty as well. The salad was more about the flavor of the lettuce mix than about the dressing. A good idea considering all the strong flavors that were coming from the other two items.

My husband liked his meal as well. Evidenced by his extremely empty plate!

Our server was also very nice and friendly.

The prices are beyond reasonable and I love the large variety of veggie and meaty dishes. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm a huge fan of good vegetarian fare. This place has definitely earned a place in our restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"YUM! I used to only order the lamb burrito. Then I used to only order the tandoori chicken sandwich. Now I only order the seared tuna sandwich with wasabi mayo. All the other food is great too but with this kind of selection it hard not to be overwhelmed.

Also noteworthy is the lamb sausage poutine with brie. And that they'll vegetarian-ize any dish.

Just be warned this place gets busy. 
Be prepared to wait for a table during prime hours."}
{"text":"So I wasn't totally impressed, and was disappointed because I had heard such good things!

Mostly I was disappointed with the service - we practically had none! It took a long time to even get water, and once we finally flagged our server to take our orders, the food took a fair amount of time. Even worse, once we had our food, we didn't see our server for a solid hour. Only two of the five of us had our plates cleared, and yet AGAIN we had to ask our server to come over, so we could request our bills.

It was also really cold, and the ceiling seemed to be dripping...

I think the back section of the restaurant where we were would be nicer in the summer, there was a greenhouse-like roof. 

The food was decent, fair pricing (I had a burger that was $9), apps weren't too much, they had a lengthy menu (diverse, veggie options, burritos, burgers, sandwiches), AND what appeared to be a good dessert menu. We left, because of the dripping...

I would go back in the summer, and give Utopia a second chance."}
{"text":"Utopia Café & Grill is a great lunch option and the burgers are TO DIE FOR! The grill also offers several vegetarian options and a few Tex-Mex dishes - Something for just about anyone. The outdoor patio is heated, which is great for chilly Toronto days or nights. They offer a full bar with great service.

The atmosphere was casual and comfortable. We had a few beers at the bar while we waited for a table. The barstaff was friendly and fun. They provided recommendations, which included the burgers and the fresh salads. We were seated pretty quickly.We decided to try the burgers and veggie nachos. We'll try the salads another day.

The burgers were amazing, as predicted. The veggie nachos were pretty good, too. The burgers came with a generous order of fries, which I always appreciate. The fries are well-done, which I also appreciate. In addition, the Café offers malt vinegar and pear cider. Both are great complements to their fries.

This Café has apparently been in business for 18 years. Their burgers are perhaps the reason why. Some of the best burgers I have ever had in my life! Absolutely amazing.

Utopia Café and Grill also offers burritos. We saw a few being delivered to patrons seated around us. They looked great, but none in my party ventured to order a burrito during our visit. The next time I go to the Café, I will try one of their burritos, though.

The waitstaff was helpful and friendly. We never had to wait for drink refills or condiments. For a great, casual lunch spot where you can get a little Tex-Mex, salads, nachos and great burgers, we highly recommend Utopia Café and Grill for a nice, casual laid-back lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing customer service. TONS of options for vegetarians. Great prices."}
{"text":"It is too bad that although Canada is a free country, men are still not legally allowed to marry burgers. Because if I could, I would have married the double-pattie bison burger that they serve up at this place. Damn, it is big, sexy, and delish. 

I haven't tried other stuff on the menu, but seriously, their burgers are out of this world."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone likes this place. We went for dinner a couple of weeks ago and the experience was just awful. The service was slow and rude, the food was barely edible (ordered a burrito and some crab cakes), and the portions left a lot to be desired for the price. If I owned/managed this place I would be ashamed of my myself for this poor excuse of a restaurant. From the reviews I have read, it sounds like it was once great but then it was sold to someone who doesn't know what they are doing which sucks. Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Ahh Utopia! This has always been my go-to spot for meeting up with old friends. I love the vibe it has. There are two main eating areas, one in the front that is smaller and then they have a bigger area in the back which is a covered heated patio. If you're looking for burritos or burgers this place had a plethora of really tasty ones. Also if you have any veggie friends there are a good amount of options for them too! My all time favourites to get are the chicken and goat cheese burrito and the baked chicken pesto panini, Yum! 

 If I was to write this review even a year ago I'd say for sure 4 or 5 stars but sadly after my last experience I'd have to give it a good ol' A-OK. Recently the service has gone down a lot, I remember holding long convos with the servers and joking around with them, but the last time I went everyone was pretty sassy(not in a fun way) and cold. Also I remember the rice being wayyyyyy better, I feel like something has changed and that scares me! 

I will for sure be back though because I do really like this place, 'till then my friends!"}
{"text":"Tables were tightly packed. Noise level rose as the few aisles of the front room filled with people waiting for tables in the supposedly spacious back room, so it wasn't until after we'd missed our movie and were walking back to the car that I could ask how my partner's burrito was.

\"It wasn't a burrito, it was a wrap with bland chicken and something else, but I'm not sure what that something was. Usually grilled chicken burrito means the chicken is grilled, not the burrito.\"

I had ordered the Lamb Sausage Poutine, but what came was not the creative take on a classic I was expecting. The merguez and brie were fine, but just sprinkled on top, out of place, unintegrated. It was like a random combination of foods in one container. After the top layer was gone, I was left eating generic gravy-soaked squishiness.

Yes, I said container, not dish. When one's food comes in a checkered paper lined basket, one expects it to come quickly. My mistake.

Bonus: We came home stinking of grease."}
{"text":"This place might entice you if you are looking reasonably priced drinks and passable food. 
The place is spartan to say the least and unfortunately on a scorcher of day I visited the seating area was unbearable. One can try and make it manageable by having some cold drinks but as one can imagine it will carry one only so far.
The beer selection is mainly mainstream and I ended up having a corona. 
Now for the food I had a steak sandwich (my first choice was unavailable). The portions are big but the quality of the food left a lot to be desired. 
I don't think I will venture here again.
2 Stars."}
{"text":"I had the utopia burger with fries and it was so good! They also had a drink special of 9 dollars for a pitcher so my friend and I shared."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love busy little restaurants like this. I've seen Michael Douglas come out of here before so you know it has to be good. On this particular occasion, a friend and I started off with the Lamb Sausage Poutine. Highly recommended. Let me tell you, now that I have had a poutine made with lamb sausage and brie cheese, I don't know if I can go back to regular poutine. I have had the burritos here before and its probably what this place is most known for. They are excellent and I probably don't have to say much about them. So I decided to have the bison burger this time and my friend had the lamb burger. They were both excellent and I highly recommend them. This place doesn't just make great burritos. 

Now, the service. I have read lots of people complaining about it but every time I have gone, its been pretty busy and they have like one server taking all the orders. She does a hell of a job, in my opinion. It's not easy in that little place. I think a little understanding and patience on your part will make your experience a lot more enjoyable. For me, it just means more time for my friends and I to hang out. If you're in a hurry, please go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I used to live around the corner from this place, and with all the options along this strip in Collage i found myself coming back time and time again.

Excellent burgers and wraps/burritos.  Because this place is relatively small there can be waits to get in, so be prepared for that eventuality or try to show up outside of peak hours. 

I would recommend pretty much all of the burgers, and any wrap that includes any combination of shrimp, chicken, steak and cheese are my favorite.  Also pay special attention to the daily special, one of the most outstanding burgers iv had here was a duck burger."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I highly recommend the burgers and poutine. Very nice atmosphere and good beer section. Pricing is very fair and standard for drinks. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I seriously adore this place. When I used to live on Euclid this was my go to place to meet friends for a bite, or to order takeout from after a late night out. It seems to be open (kitchen included) til after midnight- and the food is super tasty. The burgers are yummmmy and the burritos are too. All fresh & local ingredients- not over the top with grease. So delicious- so fresh and amazing service to boot. A tiny little patio in the back is heated in the colder weather and partly sheltered for rainy days. I wish it was bigger- but in all honesty it's something they cant fix- its just a preference I have.
I can't wait to return- I miss this place."}
{"text":"This place is not good and I feel terrible giving this restaurant a 1-star rating because that's just a super low blow. I'm sure the chefs, servers and owners are trying their best to keep the business going. I mean, OF COURSE they want the restaurant to succeed, and of course this and that, but at the end of the day, a business is a business so I apologize in advantage for this really negative review. 

I came here with a large group for lunch and I did not expect much, or anything at all. 

Just by looking at their menu, I could tell that this restaurant wasn't the greatest. I personally am not a fan of going to restaurants just to eat overpriced and oily sandwiches, burgers and paninis, especially if they're so deep fried and greasey, but Utopia won the majority vote.  

And here were some questions I had while looking at the menu beforehand: 
1. Why do some of the entrees have the word \"dinner\" in them? Am I NOT supposed to order those items for lunch? So why is it on their lunch menu then? Or is dinner just a fancy word for addressing something as an entree, but it is already under the heading \"entree.\" In my opinion, I just think adding the word \"dinner\" to describe a dish is incredibly outdated and reminds me of frozen dinner. I mean DINNER? WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?  
2. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPETIZERS AND STARTERS???
3. There is a typo on the menu. Try to spot it. 

So, why is the rating so low? 

1. As my group went around ordering, about half of the items on the menu were UNAVAILABLE and we got to the restaurant when it just opened! My group of 13 arrived around 11:35 and the restaurant OPENED at 11:30. There were so many unavailable items that it seemed TYPICAL for this restaurant to run out of x or y or z. So, why not take those items out of the menu? Why not focus on perfecting other menu items? A lot of people had to reorder beers, as a group we had to reorder the starters and appetizers (STILL don't know the difference between them. I guess \"starters\" are more for sharing?????), and no surprise, there was an item in the dessert menu that was unavailable. I understand that this is the type of restaurant to only have 2 chefs in the kitchen and maybe their food isn't that good, but it has a patio and it's cheaper than \"nicer\" restaurants and bars, and blah blah blah, but I don't know, it's just not for me. It's about money and time. There are so many bars and restaurants in Toronto, and if I can't get the food I want, then I'll just go somewhere else.  

2. For the \"appetizers\" and \"starters\", we got the chicken karaage, the spanakopita and the mushroom and pesto quesadilla. I really enjoyed the spanakopita, although I did think the spinach was just a little bit under seasoned, but the quesadilla! OH MY GLOB. It just looked unappetizing and when the last quesadilla was left on the plate, no one wanted to eat it because the whole plate was drenched in oil! What the heck?? How much oil do they use and why was it so drenched? 

3. For my main dish, I ordered a veggie burger with avocado, crispy onions, grilled onions, onions, garlic dill mayo and the sriracha mayo. Oh my goodness, I literally just remembered that I asked for jalapeños, but they didn't give me jalapeños. But, the biggest problem was that the whole thing was SO OVERSEASONED. I could barley taste the individual ingredients because it was COVERED with salt and pepper. I could see each individual pepper and salt grains in my food!! My fries were also seasoned to such an extreme and no one else had seasoning on their fries. Inconsistency! The veggie burger itself tasted really bad too, but I couldn't really tell because the shit was so salty and peppery that I was too busy chugging water after each bite. I really think I drank more of their water than eat their food. 

4. Some of their portions were just way too big and I don't think this was a good thing because I saw a lot of food get sent back and inevitably, tossed. Not only would Utopia be losing money, but it is also a waste of food. I don't think it looks good when uneaten food gets returned back to the kitchen. Someone in my group ordered poutine and it was just massive AF and half eaten. A bunch of people only ate half of their sandwiches because the portions were just too big. When portions are too big, people are also less likely to eat them. 

5. Someone mentioned their burger was dry, someone else's panini was really burnt. Someone else got the crab cake dinner and it looked like a bunch of fries and three frozen crab cakes. Someone ordered a shrimp burrito and said the seasoning was weird. JUST UGH!!!  I'm not disappointed, because this is the exact kind of food I'd figured I'd get. 

Some good things about the place? 
1. The atmosphere is nice, I guess. It's really casual. 

TLDR; Not Utopia. If you come here, just come for the spanakopita if they so happen to have it that day."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots for an easy-going meal, good beer, and a fun time.

The only real downside can be the wait during a busy dinner hour, but since they've expanded the back room that wait is a lot less frequent.

There are several excellent vegetarian options that are delicious and they can alter most non-vegetarian items if you prefer fake chicken, fake sausage, or a veggie patty. Their fake chicken is my personal favourite. Most dishes come with a variety of sides from which you choose (coleslaw, salad, fries, rice) and all are delicious. 

The service is stellar, fairly relaxed and friendly. On the odd busy night, I occasionally feel a little rushed near the end of the meal but this is to be expected when there is a line of 10 waiting at the door. 

The beer selection is limited by the number of taps they have but they typically have my favourite beers on tap so I don't mind much. 

On top of all this, the prices are extremely good for a nicer than average, funner than average, and friendlier than normal restaurant."}
{"text":"The tables and chairs are uncomfortably close together. The din of the open kitchen, the music and the crowd is overwhelming. You'll probably take a few elbows to the face from your server or the other customers. If you are seated (lucky you) you will be crowded and jostled by people who are waiting for their turn. Abandon all hope for leaving your table to use the washroom. The last time I came here, I waited almost an hour on the street (at my dining companion's insistence) just for a cramped spot at the bar. 

There's a good reason why Utopia is one of the busiest and most popular restaurants around. The food is excellent. The big, meaty burgers are perfectly topped, and there are burritos, quesadillas, fancy salads and sandwiches, too. The meals come with an unusual but delicious sesame coleslaw. The taste palette is similar to Fresh: veggie-friendly with loads of seasoning. Share a mound of nachos in lieu of a meal (you'll never get through it all alone!) or, get the onion rings with a pot of specialty mayo for dipping (green onion, jalapeno, garlic dill, roasted red pepper dijon, wasabi, or mint). 

I'd recommend a weekday lunch visit to Utopia - the crowd insanity is much diminished. Since I can't enjoy eating in such cramped quarters, I prefer to get Utopia's take-out. Then I can savour my meal without having to dodge nacho-wielding hipsters."}
{"text":"Love the poutine. Love it.
The natchos are over the top yummy but be sure to order when you have 2 or 3 people eating them. Its huge. 
Great veggie burger, and the chicken burrito, amazing. 
Just remember, you're not here to eat healthy. When you're ready to pig out, go to Utopia. If you're on a diet, or having a health conscious day...don't go there."}
{"text":"No frills, good food, reasonable prices - what's not to like?

I came here after I heard about the burritos from a few friends.  We almost ordered the nachos after seeing another table get them.  I realized this would have been way too much food after I got my burrito .  The portions here are generous.  I had the friend chicken and avocado burrito.  This was amazing - on my top 3 burritos ever in Toronto.  It almost tastes like a Mcdonalds McChicken (not sure if that's a good thing, but it was to me).  You'll get a decent sized burrito, even more rice and beans and salad.

Service is meh, but the job gets done.  $3 wine on Monday after 5pm.  I heard this place gets really busy, but we came in on a late Monday afternoon so it was dead.  I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Come in here regularly to have a quick meal in or take something out. Food is always phenomenal, service is always great. Great little gem along that stretch of College!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mother and sister, all of who had never been before. We sat in the back enclosed heated patio and each ordered something different. My mom got the chicken and brie panini, I got the chicken and goat cheese burrito and my sister got a chicken and kale salad. Overall, we were very impressed by the food and it's value. They host specials on a daily basis and they're too tempting not to get. For instance, we came on Tall Can Tuesdays (and free poutine upgrades as sides). I caved and enjoyed both specials. I will def go back as they have tons of other delicious menu items I'd love to give a try!"}
{"text":"Everything is good here, except for the mouse I saw in the bathroom downstairs and I haven't been back since. The reality is every downtown restaurant probably has some mice or bugs, the buildings are old and shitty and it's almost impossible to solve entirely....doesn't mean I want to eat there again tho."}
{"text":"Price to deliciousness ratio cannot be beat!  Amazing dishes, incredible portions, most meals under $10!  Can easily have a bill reach under 30$ for two people (before tax and drinks) and have enough lefts overs for a significant midnight snack.  

Environment's also a highlight, hip but not (too) pretentious, although some of the employees have a bit of that vibe.  But overall the place is usually packed, and the crowd is a great eclectic mix.  

Gotta do it."}
{"text":"Really yummy burritos and a great selection!  I had a cheddar cheese and steak burrito and the portion was massive.  It came with rice and peas and salad.  It was quite good.  I have two complaints: 1) the burrito was a bit drippy, and I hate when burritos get soggy.  2) Some of the rice was very hard, as if it was from the bottom of a gigantic pot.  Aside from these two minor issues, I enjoyed my time here.  They also have a cute back patio.

The recipes were great, loved the taste of the burrito.  I also enjoyed the glass of red wine I had.  I will definitely be back to try something else out here!  I want to make it to 4 star status with this place."}
{"text":"A favourite place to go for either lunch or dinner in my area.  I've never had a meal here I didn't love and that's saying something considering the giant menu they have PLUS their delicious daily specials.  Love the burgers, wraps and veggie poutine!

They've recently re-done their back patio and made it a little nicer to sit at while their inside tables remain as comfy but close together as they always have.  The service is also friendly and helpful, which considering how busy they tend to be...is always impressive.  You almost always have to wait for a table but it never takes too long and the waiters do everything they can to make you comfy - whether putting you at the bar or just updating you on how long it will be.

My only complaint (and it's a small one) is how hot it gets if you get a seat inside (in any season) due to the number of people crammed inside and the kitchen being so close to the tables.  But the food is so good, it makes up for it...especially if you get one of the coveted window seats!"}
{"text":"Utopia: Definition: a place of ideal perfection .... 

Well, Utopia Cafe isn't perfection, per se, but it is one the best places in Little Italy for a weekend brunch get-together or a yummy lunch burrito. 

 Served Saturdays and Sundays from 12-4pm, the brunch is cheap (about $10/person) and offers a great selection including a delicious smoked salmon and swiss omelette, a Morocan breakfast and the classic steak and eggs for a protein-rich fix. This is one of the few breakfast menus that is filling, but doesn't feel like your soaking yourself in a vat of grease and bacon chunks. Mmmmm, bacon....

 As for lunch, I've always enjoyed their burrito menu. There are about 15 choices including grilled chickpea, eggplant and shrimp-which are all de-lish and range in price from $9.99-$11.99. Or, if you aren't into burritos, other great meal ideas at Utopia are burgers and quesadillas.

 What I truly recommend at Utopia is their brunch-you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had a recent visit and still giving it 4 stars although there is definitely some room for improvement.  I'm not a regular customer but I've been a few times before.

The place used to have food and drink specials - they seem to be gone, which is a shame.  It's a good thing it's still very reasonably priced otherwise I would probably cross it off the list.  It'd be nice to see some of their favorite deals return.

Service this time that we went was super slow and she only had two tables.  Painfully slow - we could barely get our bill out of the server.  No idea where she kept going or what she was doing, all we know is she wasn't anywhere near the front room most the night.

Food quality is still superb - arguably the best nachos in Toronto (although the chicken was a little fake tasting this time..)   The starters that we ordered were still excellent as well.

I'll still to continue to be an infrequent customer here and stop by while in the area."}
{"text":"Really good food at really cheap prices. The price to portion ratio is amazing. This is one of my regular spots in the city. I highly recommend their burgers or burritos."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and have yet to be disappointed.  Prices are touch higher here than average, but you en

Le Burger is a deliciously juicy patty smothered with spicy Dijon, red peppers and brie.  A bit messy, but the sauce has a nice little tangy kick to it that'll surprise your first bite.  I rarely eat fries that come with burgers, 'cuz well they usually suck, but here, they had great flavour and had a great ratio of extra crispy burnt fries to non burnt.

The kissing cousins burger is a big favourite, the combo of a lamb burger topped with goat cheese is something to get your mouth excited.  Definitely not your typical burger.

Pretty much everything I've tried on the menu has been fairly consistent in quality.  I could go into more detail about every item I've eaten, but what's the point?  They've all ranged from pretty good to great , so I have confidence you can't really go wrong here.

My only grip about the place is the waiting time.  It's a pretty popular, so you might have to wait 10-15 min on any given night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place in Toronto.
Always amazing customer service, food and drinks! I took my husband for first time and he loves it!! ( He's little picky about burgers..) I had Mushroom&Pasto Casadia for first time here and it was so good. I liked it. Probably we will come back when we cme to Toronto."}
{"text":"I took a chance on Utopia, based solely on the star rating and the scant offerings for quiet dinner date spots in Bathurst-Spadina area. Utopia far exceeded my expectations.

My date and I both ordered the quesadillas - mine was mushrooms and pesto, hers was grilled chicken and sweet potatoe - and I grabbed some of their Rasberry Wheat beer.

The portions were huge for a measly $12 or so. The quesadillas were crispy, delicious, and didn't send ingredients everywhere when I bit into them. It also came with a hefty helping of mexican style rice and some spinach salad (you can also swap that out for fries or something). I came there hungry, with my date feeling a little peckish, and neither of us could finish our food.

The seating could've been more intimate, with the small place being populated by a dozen or so tables with nice wooden chairs, but the lighting and low noise level made it surprisingly cozy.

The servers were also top notch. It's one of those situations where they check up on you at the right times, without being too pesky or too hard to flag down.

Also, the Raspberry beer was top notch. They may not have had a ton of beers on tap, but I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good food at good prices.

This places is nice if you want to have s conversation and still have a bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"I abide by the old adage that we \"eat with our eyes,\" and I do appreciate when a place puts a bit of an emphasis on presentation, not that I frequently eat in places that make a practice of this.  But with that said it does go a long way when a slice of lemon comes perched on the edge of an ice filled water glass or a wrap is cut neatly on a bias and stacked against a bed of fries and not just plopped on a plate.  I relish the collective gasp of a table when certain crowd pleaser's make a grand entrance and at Utopia everything is aesthetically pleasing.  Simple, yet elegant in it's own way, and yes the portions are more than generous.

When I first frequented Utopia a few weeks back it had been on my to do list for a few months prior.  It came highly recommended by a roommate whose track record on food had been pretty solid,  I was told to order the panko crusted salmon burrito, which I did and my girlfriend ordered the poutine and a mushroom/goat cheese salad.  The poutine was EXCEPTIONAL!! I didn't think that veggie gravy could do the trick, but it did.  the cheese curds were plentiful and the fries retained their satisfying crunch despite being drenched in amazing gravy.

However I was a bit disappointed with the panko crusted salmon.  The portion was incredibly generous and coming to the table it did generate the aforementioned gasps of pleasure that a good looking plate of food should, yet unfortunately it didn't quite live up to it's potential.  It was definitely passable, but wasn't memorable in any way.  And in this case looks were deceiving, like a beautiful girl with a vacuous stare and a hollow heart.  You want it to work so badly, but question whether it ever can or will, and this is my current predicament with Utopia."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during a walking tour of Toronto, and I can't think of a more delicious way to re-fuel!

Thank goodness we were told by a friend ahead of time that they had excellent burgers, because we may have had trouble with the large and diverse menu otherwise.

My husband and I shared the Utopia burger with lamb. I always figure that if a place is willing to put their name on something, you can't go wrong. And in this case, I was right. You could tell that the meat was very good quality and very lean. The multiple cheeses and roasted veggies made up for any dryness. The bun was HUGE. 

I have to admit the fries looked better than they tasted...it seemed like they may have been sitting around for a bit. They were very plentiful, however, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy them by the fistful : )

Combined with beers, the burger and fries was PLENTY of food for two people, and we walked out more than satisfied. Great lunch place- will definitely return if I am ever in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Celebration dinner with family
Visited Utopia in early May to celebrate a birthday. The parking is a bit of hassle but not a biggie. The restaurant was packed, but they took about 5-10 minutes to set up a table for 5. The restaurant is not set up for groups larger than 4. The sitting was a bit uncomfortable. Once in the we were attended right way. 

All 5 of were vegetarians to begin with and they have tons of veggie options that was one of the reasons why we visited this establishment based on the reviews. Had veggie nachos to begin with. Not the best we have had but still made it to top 5. 

We had three burgers on the table - Utopia, Swiss & Mushroom and Southwestern all with Poutine - an extra charge of $3 for each. There is just way too much food on plate for one to finish. So order poutine only if you think you can finish it. All the burgers were devoured. There was also a Vegetarian Souvlaki with fries and a Crispy Veggie Chicken burrito with Salad. I would say the Souvlaki and Veggie Chicken Burrito were the best with the Souvlaki a slightly better edge. Good balance of Veggie Chicken and veggies. 

We also shared a creme brule. Had a nice crunch on top and a creamy custard which was not very sweet. Nice way to end the meal. 

The service and wait staff were prompt and courteous. It does get cool in the back yard covered patio. They closed one of the \"windows\" after a while. They need better chairs as well. All in all a good trip from western suburb and worth the drive. Would definitely go back and recommend to my friends and families. A good place for vegetarians for sure."}
{"text":"Always a wicked spot for cheap and delicious food. I usually try something different all the time. The burgers here are amazing, the burritos are too. The vegetarian options are galore. I'm, also a huge fan of the soups, always hot and spicy"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but something major has changed! I always used to get a burrito but the last three times I've ordered or been in the burritos has been disgusting. Like, inedible mush. The poutine is still great, that's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one. But I have to scratch this place now. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. And it's been three times. I'm not eating here again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident.  Had a delicious lamb burger and the best sweet potato and ginger soup ever.  The poutine was okay (prefer a more meaty broth) and enjoyed the meal with a raspberry wheat beer.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 3 times now and I gotta up their score to a 4. Their panini's/sandwiches are really tasty. I think I was just thrown off on my first visit wen all I got was a simple Greek salad. I ordered their mushroom, pesto and goat cheese sandwich with a side of poutine,  and couldn't complain about any of it. Again, there was enough to take home leftovers. Its a great spot :)"}
{"text":"Decent food. Awful service. We arrived on a weekday around 8:30 PM, and were seriously looking for good eats after a long day at work. 

We ordered right away: a) steak nachos (an extra $4 for steak), and b) the Utopia chicken club. Although the restaurant wasn't too busy (it was a weekday evening, after all), it took about 45-50 minutes for our food to arrive, without any explanation. Without giving ourselves time to think, we dove in and ate right away (a hungry stomach is a hungry stomach, after all). The food was decent, and the steak was nice and perfectly cooked. Portion sizes were also very generous! No complaints there. However, while the wait time for food was long, the wait time for the bill was another story. After our food came, we didn't see our server at all. No sign of her. No inkling of her. Until, about 35 minutes later, she casually walked by, and didn't bother stopping when we waved and signalled for the bill (honestly, we could have dined and dashed, I don't think anyone would have noticed!) After waiting 45-55 minutes for our bill (I know, we waited that long, not very smart of us), we gave up, walked into the tiny corridor leading into the kitchen, and signalled one of the cooks that we needed our bill. 

With tax and (a small) tip, our total came to around $40.00 - we won't be back. Don't think I can spare another extra hour of waiting to hand over money, just to physically walk into the restaurant's kitchen asking for my bill. No thank you!"}
{"text":"YES!!!!!

If you're hungry Utopia does not disappoint. The menu is huge, bordering on too many choices and the Kitchen staff are cool about substitutions (if you can find a combination of ingredients not already on their menu). I would say however, the rice and beans could use a bit more...something in the flavor dept., but that's me stretching to find something to critique. Service is always quick and attentive, and help to get you seated as quick as possible. The burritos are brick sized, and happily sit like one too, and their nachos rival any on the block.  

The patio is nice in the back but a little bit drafty in the winter. That's ok though, you're about to have some meat/cheese sweats in a minute anways... They also have drink specials daily for the lush in you, most notably $3.50 glass of wine mondays? 

A very solid bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times, and every single time I'm here, both I and the person I'm eating with are super pleased with the food and the service.  I've never had a single complaint about anything here -- every single waiter and waitress that's ever served me has been wonderful and helpful (I came to eat here last night and David was our waiter -- probably one of the nicest waiters I've ever had, a big thumbs up to him).

And, perhaps more importantly, every single meal I've had here has been really great.  I suggest the chicken and sweet potato burrito!  Also, I generally don't care for atmosphere in restaurants, but Utopia has a super lovely patio out back, and a really nice, cozy but elegant feel on the inside.

A+ for everything."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian-friendly casual fare. They will make anything on the menu for you with mock meat. Their burgers and burritos are fantastic and they take condiments to the next level.

They have lots of different flavored mayos. The wasabi and red pepper ones are both fantastic. The gravy is also great - and vegetarian. And be sure to try the hot sauce at every table.

The one downside for me is the wait. Not the amount of time, you have to expect that from most \"hot\" places. But that despite the popularity, the staff always seems completely unprepared to deal with the lineup - and the venue is set up in such a way that there is no waiting area, making an ever increasing amount of people wait in the doorway."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm still so on the fence about Utopia. 

The first time I experienced Utopia was through a takeout order. I went into the restaurant and asked if it was possible to order a grilled veggie with crispy protein added to the sandwich (which the hostess said she could do at an extra charge), with no mayo. Well I got the sandwich home, and there was mayo on it, and a couple of onions, plus the crispy protein. I don't think paying $10.00 for a GRILLED VEGGIE sandwich is quite right when in my mind and according to the menu, the grilled veggies consist of roasted red peppers, eggplant, etc. However, the sandwich was delicious. But I was annoyed.

When my sister came into town I decided we could go there as her boyfriend (who is a meat-eater) was incredibly hungry, I thought it would be quick, and would allow for both the vegetarians and the meat-eaters to be satisfied. We sat on the back patio and our waiter was terrific. He was very nice. The food came quickly, was piled high with fries. I had the veggie burger and it was okay, but lacked in flavor or spices or something, and I found it tough to eat.. like, how a steak can be tough to eat? My sister ordered the grilled veggie sandwich and it came as I had assumed originally it should, with lots of veggies and she seemed to like it.

I keep going to Utopia though. The spring rolls are really good, and I generally like the service. Probably the reason I keep going back is because the menu it stocked full of what I consider to be my comfort food. Lots of finger foods, fries, onion rings, and veggie options galore. And while I really didn't like the coleslaw (no flavor), I know I must order the crispy veggie chicken burrito before I do or do not give Utopia my final kiss of approval. But I know I'll be back. Within a five minutes' walking distance, and a stocked menu, how can I resist?"}
{"text":"Great food - no really, Great!

Be warned tho, it's small and gets very busy esp in the summer between 7 and 9."}
{"text":"Utopia remains one of my favourite spots on the College strip, with a rather large yet well-executed menu, full of creative pairings and lesser-known ingredients. Both the burritos and burgers are quite massive and especially tasty, it's hard to find one that won't satisfy. There are a few misses (I found the vegetarian souvlaki bland), but many more hit the spot very well. Wine and beer on offer also fit that description, but the liquor selection is excellent and very well priced. Knob Creek for $6? Yes please.

Utopia has done an excellent job catering to both meat eaters and vegetarians alike, from the look of things, aided I'm sure by an almost interchangeable menu. As some have noted, the service is a bit relaxed. From repeated observation, it's not that they're bad, simply not under much pressure, it seems. Once, say, empty water glasses are noticed, they're immediately filled, and every single person who works there is quite friendly. It's often full up, which is a testament to the value and quality, and a warning to show up early; but not too early, I still want my seat, after all.

Of worthy note; the espresso here tastes like happiness."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with two friends. We got there at around 7:30 and waited half hour for a table on the roofed in \"patio,\" which is essentially the same as eating indoors. 

We got there and it took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, even though she walked past it numerous times. When she finally came by we ordered drinks and appetizers. Big mistake. Once our apps arrived,  I asked the person who brought them to us if we could order, and was told \"I'm not your server I don't take orders.\" I replied as politely as possible, \"Ok - well if you don't mind could you tell our server we'd like to order?\" She tells me \"she's right over there\" and points off somewhere in the distance. 

We finish our apps, and another 20 minutes goes by. Mind you, the server had passed our table twice during this time, and I tried to flag her down and she either ignored me or might have be deaf. 

Finally she emerges to take our order. I ordered the chicken quasadillas (which were actually quite good.) Another 20 minutes later our food finally arrives. I must say, everything we ordered was really good, and very reasonably priced. The portions were quite large, and the menu has a great variety of things to choose from.

Once we were done eating, we waited patiently for our server to bring us the bill. The person who brought our appetizers came by twice to refill our water, and I didn't want to ask her to get our server again because of what she had told me last time. Our server eventually gets there, we ask her for our bill, she leaves and I see her pouring a tray of drinks to take to another table. 

Now it is not normal by any means, for it to take 10 minutes to bring a bill to a damn table. Once the bill got there, I'm not even gonna say how long it took for her to take our credit cards, but it got to the point where I was waving the stupid thing in her face, which still seemed to have no affect. 

Frustrated out of my mind, I went up to another server and asked her to charge me.

Needless to say, the food was pretty good, and it's unfortunate that the service was the most atrocious service I've received for as long as I can remember. I probably won't be back here for a while."}
{"text":"The Nachos here are AMAZING... well, my advice is to order them with extra cheese with the salsa on the side.

I've been eating here for years and never had a problem with the food - the only thing I'll critique is that the servers will sometimes forget to bring extras (bottles of hot sauce etc) and there's always a 1hr+ wait most nights.."}
{"text":"Tried their Utopia burger. What can I say about it? Hmm....it is only the most majestic and best tasting burger I've had in my life. It was like eating freedom brought down by a flaming eagle the size of a mountain and served on a platter made of thunder clouds. Unfortunately, nothing in this life is perfect and even the Utopia burger is subject to criticism. The problem was that it had so many toppings and meat, handling the burger required so much dexterity that it would probably require its own certificate course. After much practice, I've managed to perfect this art and can fully enjoy everything this burger has to offer. I have to admit, my life has gotten exponentially better since then. Oh it also includes a serving of fries that deserve a review of their own."}
{"text":"I love this place. We eat here probably more than any other restaurant in Little Italy, and the menu is quite extensive yet affordable (most plates are $9-$15) and delicious. Originally I wasn't going to write a review for this place as I'd hate to see the lineups for tables increase even more than what they can be at times already, but I guess its time to move past my fears as I'm pretty sure the secret is already out given they've been open for more than a decade.

Their Bacon Cheddar Burger is my favourite burger in the city (and I eat a lot of hamburgers). It is a massive half pound patty with a whole lot of great toppings and a side of their tasty crispy fries. For $12 its a steal.
Their sandwiches and burritos are also pretty awesome, and while the menu hasn't changed in years (why mess with a good thing, right?), they do have specials each day. I was able to try a Hawaiian Chicken Burger (grilled chicken breast, fresh sliced pineapple, bacon, etc) a week or so back and was quite impressed by it. 
On the appetizer front try the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers with pomegranate molasses and walnuts served with grilled naan) but save some to dip your french fries in too. Also, the Chicken Karaage is quite delicious as well for a more meat based intro to your dining experience.
And like most Toronto restaurants, they do take advantage of the brunch craze with a nice selection of omelets, breakfast burritos, and other things that can be washed down with a tasty pint of KLB Raspberry Wheat Ale.

The only reason I'm not going to give this place 5 stars is that the service can be a bit spotty at times. Aside from that, nothing but love for Utopia!"}
{"text":"Met a couple of school chums here for a weekday lunch, and had a decent experience. We met at 12:30 on a Wednesday, and there was no wait for a table (though I wouldn't have expected one, given the time).  It was a gorgeous spring day, so my chums and I opted for the covered patio seating, which was perfect. Shady, but not so dark that we couldn't enjoy the perfect weather. Service was speedy and friendly, which was a great thing because as soon as we saw giant plates of nachos being served to other diners, we had to have them right away. They certainly didn't disappoint: toasted chips piled sky-high with cheese, chicken, crema, beans, and more cheese. Delicious, and more than enough for three to split and still have food left over. Quality was good, but nothing to write home about. I also tried to be healthy and opted for a side greek salad, which was decent. For a side salad, the portion was quite large. Impressive.

I might visit Utopia again just to hang on their patio. I had a decent experience -- nothing earth shattering, but nothing bad that would prevent me from going back."}
{"text":"What is this place? Tex-Mex? Burgers? Indian influenced? Poutine? Feisty Caesars? It's all of these. All. Of. Them. How'd they squish such a hefty menu into such a small kitchen? Ye be warned: It might take you some time to digest the choice. Never have I been so conflicted between two different cuisines. In the course of 10 minutes I had changed my mind a number of times, swaying between a burrito and a burger. How is this possible?

The staff here gets it. Our server saw the look of decision-making fear in our eyes and guided us through some of her favourites. Finally, I settled in with a Utopia Burger, which includes the works, grilled veggies, mushrooms, onions, 3 kinds of cheese, and of course, the patty. With all of the choices, I forgot I even had a choice of chicken, beef, lamb, bison or veggie. I was happy with my juicy beef burger. And thank goodness I went bunless, I'm 100% certain this could never be a handheld meal. My fork and knife barely worked through the mountain of toppings and it took me a number of bites before I found my way to the patty. It was dense. 

It got pretty cramped in here as we devoured our meals. Tables fill fast. If you're nestled into a corner, be prepared to suck in your extra food pounds and wrestle your way past other tables to get out."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I'm gonna be real with you, which I always am. I have to say, I was OVERWHELMED WITH DISAPPOINTMENT with these other reviews!  

I ordered from Utopia via UberEats so I didn't have direct contact with this alleged salty waiter... Word on the Yelp street is, this dude's got a 'tude.  Anyway, I'm not mad about it cuz it MUST be the perfect amount of sass to make that Chicken Karachi taste so so succulent.  And for only $5??? Once I ordered 2 boxes of chicken for $10--it was TOO MUCH...much too much. But it was tasty! It's next level delicious.  Like, I would eat this chicken for breakfast just so I could have it as much as possible.

Also the poutine wasn't the best poutine I've ever had, but it was sooo HUGE. I'm talkin' thicc cut fries and THICC cheese curds. When the UberEats driver delivered it, he was using both arms to haul it--SO HEAVY.  The cheese curds need to be chopped up a little it because they're as big as an adult ring finger.  It's TOO MUCH. 

Anyway, overall, I thank my fellow yelpers for the heads up.  Wont be droppin' by the location anytime soon, but the FOOD THO... That poutine is 2-3 meals. I'mma keep ordering via UberEats. Deep fried chicken is good for me right? Cuz of the protein?

4 stars! @nishaJD"}
{"text":"What an awesome find! My first vegetarian poutine was everything I'd hoped for. My veggie burger was scorched beyond deliciousness. The layer of jalapenos did my my face numb, but what you do you expect from a Southwest burger? (Lightweight status: confirmed.)

And despite having the potential to be uber-hipster I was given nothing but smiles and helpfulness from the staff. Is this just Canada in general, or Utopia living up to its name? Regardless, I might have to apply for citizenship."}
{"text":"utopia:  a more ironic name i cannot recall.  

it's a shame about this place.  i've eaten here at least a dozen times and utopia has done nothing but go downhill.  menu has great potential.  oodles of vegetarian options.  but, my food and my guest's food were both room temp. at best.  restaurant itself is...filthy.  pieces of dried food stuck on the wall beside our table.  dust and grime so thick on the sugar caddy, i literally carved my initials into it.  

apart from the aforementioned, my next complaint is the serving staff.  they have one lone server working the whole restaurant.  there is a \"server assistant\" helping out as well.  the server assistant is basically there to bus dirties and refill water.  if you ask for anything else, she politely gestures toward the server.  there is NO way one server can adequately look after 20-ish tables.  constantly waiting for...everything.  and this is not a fluke, or a call-in-sick shortstaffed situation, this is the keep-labour-costs-down norm.  they've got it running like a machine, i suppose.  and if you want your experience to feel machinated, that's great.  i'm not interested in water down, drink order, food order, check back, check down.  i can dine at home for free and get better service from my boyfriend.  

last, and perhaps most profound, was the \"manager\", mark (marc?).  after asking our server to speak to the manager, i could see him across the room rehearsing the load of bs he was about to spew forth.  without so much as a \"hi\", \"hello\", \"how are you\", \"you asked to speak to the manager?\", mark came up to the table and quickly pointed out that my concern (i won't get into the sordid tale b/c i don't feel like having a mini-stroke at recounting the details) was both unfounded and a nuisance, and then promptly and passive-aggressively, walked away without my saying a single syllable.  wow.  that was the manager.  i hope the owner knows who he's got at the helm when he's away.  

so, in sum, delicious sounding (stress:  \"sounding\") menu items, room temperature food, robotic yet ironically slow service, no attention to detail, grimy environment and a manager that plumb doesn't give a rat's arse.  the bf and i now refer to this place as \"dystopia\"."}
{"text":"3.5! 

Whoa! Heated patio ftw! 
Definitely good service: had my water refilled every 15 minutes or so. Plus, not that long of a wait for food.

Good food (poutine with goats cheese and yummy gravy?! nachos the size of a mini asteroid? quesadilla with pesto and muuuushrooms & amazingly fresh salad + rice?! + chai latte!!!) in generous portions (couldn't fit in dessert... we just died). I must say, the chai latte reminded me of Butter Beer[1]. 

I'd definitely like to come back to try some of their other stuff (e.g. dessert and burritos... :D). 


[1] From Harry Potter :D The cup and the foam!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving Utopia 3 stars is because I ordered their Nachos and it was not very good.  A huge portion loaded with goodies and the cheese nicely melted on the top, but the underneath of the dish was actually cold.  My wife ordered one of their signature salads and it was amazing so next time I will definitely  order one of their signature dishes with hopes of rating Utopia higher.  The service could be a little better."}
{"text":"Ok went last night Friday around 1030p (Nov), with my sis (vegetarian) and our friend (vegan) + me (hungry carnivore)

Atmosphere:
swankier than expected from the outside. It is a bit 'cozy' but I never went further into the restaurant than my seat right at the front windows and my back was to the rest of the place so I didn't look around much. There is music playing at a level that will make you raise your voice a little, but no shouting necessary. Dim lighting, dark walls setting the mood. 
Great for a date, for a few friends, but with the cramped quarters it is not a place to bring a large group [note I have not seen the back patio or back of restaurant but assume it maintains a similar space]

Service:
For us - great. Our waitress brought waters before greeting us (in my opinion a good tip when your busy, slows down chances of complaint). We order three hot teas, and she kept them coming throughout the night consistently. She knew we were clearly newcomers to the restaurant and needed to review the menu and didn't rush us and and took our orders and executed them to the T.  Our plates were cleared promptly as we ate, she didn't over bother us, but yet was never too far to ask for an extra side of mushroom gravy for the fries. This is me should be a standard of dining service - she didn't go above and beyond, but did her job and service well. Thank you girl

Food/Drinks:
Only had water and hot tea, but they were...well water and hot tea, can you really do these wrong?
Food wise I say YES! They got it really right. Having vegan/veggie friends and being a well-versed carnivore can make eating out together and all being able to properly enjoy meals difficult. This menu had SO many options that were veggie/vegan friendly as well as so many options of meats dishes for me. A true rarity in my experience. Normally My sis has to choose from either the salmon, shrimp or vegetable medley mess and thats it.
I ordered the lamb burger and for $11.00 I was fearful of the norm of course. Will it taste good? Look good? most importantly be bigger than the size & thickness of a toonie?? And it was! It was fresh off the grill, surprisingly thick, well cooked and not burned, and most of all delicious!! My sis ordered I think the veggie sausage burrito and our friend a veggie burger of sorts but ALL of us thoroughly enjoyed our entrees. I'd say the biggest downfall of the meals was the fries. Plenty of them, but I love when restaurants of this standard give nice steak fries. Cannot wait to try out the Bison burger and the Le Brie burger next!

Bang for my Buck?
YES
For all 3 of us our total was $37. And we all went home full. I reccommend it, great locale, there seems to be some velvet rope club right next door and the streetcar drops off directly in front. I shall return even just for takeout.


*****
Update -
Went back last week to get some take-out. 
Ordered the Bison burger, definitely not as great as the lamb, but sill very worth the money. Only issue I had, was it a just a bit dry. The meat is leaner and I guess I just prefer that deliciously fatty lamb.
We sat (before realizing we just wanted to go home and eat) in the back patio, it was well warmed for the winter winter, plenty of tables and our waiter for 10 minutes was a sweet guy. 
Yes I will be a returning customer here :)"}
{"text":"Took a $15 taxi down to check this place out more than an hour before they close. Turns out they close whenever they feel like it. Staff we unfriendly and not helpful when I walked in. Ended up in the street trying to discover other options on my phone. Make sure to check this place out, as long as you are OK with the fact that their hours of operation is more of a guideline than a rule."}
{"text":"I have this thing for Lamb so as soon I saw the Lamb Sausage and Brie poutine I knew I had to order it. At first sight I wasn't sure that the brie cheese would work out too well. But as the cheese mixed with the gravy, it got WAY better. Combined with the lamb sausage which had the perfect peppery kick to it, I was ready have a heart attack right then and there.

Service was a tad disappointing as for we were ignored for the first 10-15 minutes. Waitresses were slow to bring us water and menus (when other people seemed to have no such trouble)."}
{"text":"** 3.5 Stars **

So first off, I have to say the back room Utopia has is awesome, I walked in and was disappointed that all 4 tables at the front were taken and then I noticed a bunch of people in the back. A little step closer and I found a nice warm room drenched in sunlight and for 6 months of the year, this is as close to a patio as you'd get in Toronto. 

Once sitting down and having a look at the menu I can pretty much sum the whole thing up in 3 words: Salads, Burritos and Burgers... and a whole lot of each kind! Just imagine a kind of burrito and burger and they've probably thought of the flavour combination, not to mention that you can add your own \"gourmet\" toppings. The food was pretty good for the price (most burritos and burgers around $10) but the rice and slaw that came with my burrito was pretty crappy. 

Service unfortunately was really slow.. I think we were there from 2:40 - 4:30 and all we had was a burger and burrito (I can be described as a duck when I'm hungry... a.k.a.I like to devour my food without the whole chewing part).

All in all a pretty cool place to grab a burger but not much more that."}
{"text":"Another late night at the office and my hubby agreed to pick me up something for dinner..... so another salad it was.. but where?

Blog TO recommended this place and I love seared tuna so that's what I got. 
S brought it to me in a lovely Utopia cafe paper bag, and inside was a takeout box, biodegradable utensils, and a plastic container with marker drawn happy face containing my balsamic mushrooms (part of the dressing).

I opened the salad box to find probably the largest salad I've seen in my life. Honestly, it was as large as the boxed salad you buy in a grocery store. It looked fresh with lots of tomatoes inside, in addition to several slices of lemon for the tuna. Because the salad looked so big, the chunk of salad looked pretty small, but it was actually a pretty decent size of tuna steak. Slightly raw in the middle, I would have preferred the salad to be less seared.

The mushrooms were so incredibly large... i was very very happy because I don't get to eat mushes very often (s doesn't like them so it's not in our kitchen!). But they were still delicious.

I was told by S that when he arrived at the cafe, the people were extremely nice, offered him a drink as he waited for the take out order.

My coworker also says this place is often and it will be good to come back for a sit down meal.

I'm a pretty big salad eater, and this is one of the very few times I didn't finish my greens. shocking isn't it.?"}
{"text":"One of those places that people in the know already know about.  Some of the best wraps in the city. I'm a confirmed carnivor who has walked away satisfied with their veggie dishes.  If you are looking for animal though they have a great burger."}
{"text":"4 stars for the excellent service :) Lovely people in there. Sadly, the food I had was blah. I picked a gross and unhealthy dish (veggie chili cheese fries) so I should have expected it wouldn't be awesome. I didn't even bother to complain because again, it's just one of those dishes you either love or hate. I DO enjoy their veggie burritos and should have stuck with that. Forgive them for any mishaps because for every bad dish (which is probably just a matter of taste) there are 4 good ones."}
{"text":"Since the last time I was here, it feels like the menu has changed. While there is an overwhelming selection of burritos, they also have satisfying salads and soups. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a red curried lentil (?) and a small Greek salad. The soup was delicious!  I loved lentil soup!

Funny story, I sat there for 30 min waiting for my salad to come out. No one asked me how I was doing or if I wanted anything else. I called a server and told her I was waiting for my salad. She gave me a perplexed look; came back and told me none had been sent to the kitchen!  Considering my first server threw the business card on the table when I asked for the wi fi password, I was not surprised my order was overlooked. Thankfully, the 2nd server was more gracious and quickly sent the order to the kitchen.

The salad was on the house. Because they rectified their mistake, I am rating them highly."}
{"text":"Utopia is another great place in toronto for great food at a reasonable price. you will deffinetly feel like you are getting value at this place.

A Latin and Mexican/pub fusion. Serving gollo pinto (Costa Rican rice and beans) with most meals selections.  Huge selections of burritos, burgers, Quesadillas with interesting ingredients 

Fav's include the chicken/feta burritos, utopia nachos (as big as your head) and their buffalo burger!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place... When it's nice outside you can't beat eating their delicious food with a cold drink on the patio. I tend to get their burritos a lot and I have never been disappointed. I am getting hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"I wish there are more places like Utopia in the city where both meat eaters and vegetarians can dine together happily.  No, you wont find any fine dining here but the food is great, price is right and the servers always seems happy.  i love eating at the back patio and the fact that its mostly covered doesn't bother me at all as Toronto doesn't have the best patio weather anyway.  Sometimes it can be VERY busy so be prepared to wait for a table but if you luck out, you might get a table right away."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark list for awhile.  My boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to come here for dinner.  It's right on College, so great for people watching.  We walked in and were greeted by our friendly server.

Apparently the back bar was closing so we couldn't go back there.  To be honest if she hadn't mentioned it I wouldn't have even noticed it.  That was fine though, we were happy to sit in the front.  It's small (about 7-8 tables), but you're not stuck close together.  Once we sat down we looked and could see the back area down a hallway, it looked pretty happenin' for a Monday night.  Friendly attentive service 

I like the menu here because there is a really good variety of food.  We both opted for a burger and were really happy with our decision.  I had the lamb burger.  It was a bit dry for my liking, but it still tasted great and they made up for it with generous toppings.  The fries were AMAZING.  Crispy, seasoned and the dipping sauces we ordered were delicious.  Probably some of the best fries I've ever had.  The portion sizes were great for the price, I had a little snack to take home which tasted just as good when I ate it a few hours later.  lol  

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love the back Patio area. Great spot for a hearty lunch. Come hungry. The crispy chicken burrito is always my go-to. Didn't realize until recently that you can substitute the mixed greens for other options. Bonus!

The staff is always friendly and on point. Consistently what it is."}
{"text":"I love Utopia.

This is my go to when I am entertaining out of towners. They have such a wide variety on the menu, and everything my friends and I have ever tried was great! (Burritos, real and fake burgers, utopia nachos w/tufu, poutine)

Also, didn't realize how cheap it was. Went there with a group of four, we all got a pint of beer and one my friends had three shots of tequila (alki?). Anyhow, we left full of great food with a buzz on, and our bill was around 60 bones. It doesn't get much better than that!

Back patio is where its at. Sometimes you gotta wait. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fried Chicken dinner. The Chicken was ok. It wasn't at all what I expected when you think of Fried Chicken. 
The \"slaw\" was very unappealing and not very flavorful at all. 
The fries were ok and our food took forever to arrive. But they apologized for the wait so...oh well."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place gets good reviews. But maybe my mother and I came on an off day. My mom said her veggie burger was terrible, but my nachos were okay, I've had better though. I'm sure this place has other good things, but we didn't have the greatest time on that particular day...

Sorry, Utopia, not the paradise we were expecting. :/"}
{"text":"I thought that was okay. Wasn't that impressed. Their own made chips were good but the dip was okay. They were smart to put the tiny already made chicken that's also used for appetizer for the burger too. I didn't like it though. The taste was good but the chicken were into too many pieces that it was hard to eat. Overall it was alright. Nothing really special here"}
{"text":"Visited Utopia on a Saturday morning for Brunch. We ordered Americanos to start, which were delicious. Also ordered a Oyako poutine, and Utopia Breakfast with scrambled eggs. That's where the good stuff ends. For some odd reason, they only offer scrambled or poached eggs. The poached eggs looked like little hockey pucks, cooked in the form of a ladle... From where we were sitting by the bar, we had a view of their kitchenette and a roach strutting its stuff on the tile floor. We notified the waitress who stared at the critter and in her hesitation, let it scurry under the stove. We saw her tell the chef, who said \"it is what it is\". I honestly don't know why I continued to wait for my food after that. Appetite was completely ruined. The food is okay, but not THAT good that I can overlook a roach in the middle of the restaurant. I mean, come on, they have traps for these."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a cold Saturday evening with two of my friends.  My friend told me that the burgers here were DELICIOUS, so I had to go.

We were sat at the bar initially, and we had a couple of beers.  About 15 minutes later, we were seated at the back (heated patio?).  It was a little bit TOO hot for me in my opinion (I was seated underneath the heaters). 

We first ordered a poutine to share - definite recommend.  I had ordered myself a crispy salmon burrito.  Sadly, wasn't as good as I hoped.  Mainly because the salmon wasn't as crispy a I hoped it to be.  However, the sesame slaw was amazing.  In regards to my friends - they said the burgers were really good.  Perhaps I shall go again just to try myself some burgers."}
{"text":"We arrived here on a snowy Saturday evening around 6ish hoping to be the only couple canoodling over wine and apps. Turns out we were just in time to grab one of the last available tables? interesting....

so the evening began with 1/2 liter of chardonnay, poutine, tofu cream croquettes, and it was simply divine. We had no room for dinner after that but why stop a good thing right? 

Next up we ordered Mediterranean burger and chicken with coat cheese wrap made with grilled veggie soy chicken. the only thing that was blah on the plate was maybe the salad (too much vinaigrette). Everything else was delish! also, watching the snow fall as we ate and sipped on our wine was fun. They also dimmed the lights and turned up the music a bit to create this lounge atmosphere which was good but if you're looking for candle light romance then no luckily we weren't =)

I *must* dock a star for serving poutine in a (gasp!) basket lined with paper, comeon I know you folks have a bowl back there - is it too much to ask for?

As we got our leftover food to go, the only thought on our minds was must-come-back-and-try-other-things !"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was decent. I would go back for the waffles Benny. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Utopia should have been my last meal of my Toronto trip rather than one of my first. The experience lives up to its name almost too well, jading all meals that followed.

Think five pages of sandwiches, burritos, quesadillas and nachos of all shapes, sizes and ingredients, each under $10 (for the most part) and each able to be made with vegetarian 'meats'.

I'm still longing for just one more bite of that breaded 'chicken' burrito...I've never been more mad about getting full than that day. It was cheesy, saucy hotness and I'm pretty sure I was minutes away from doing dirty-bad things to it had there been fewer witnesses.

Utopia also has an incredible sense of humour. Order something with the 'handful of fries' and you'll know what I mean. You'll also then be able to feed a family of five."}
{"text":"You know when someone is like, \"I don't know what I feel like? I could eat something for sure I just don't know what. What do you guys want? I guess I don't want Indian but I'll eat pretty much whatever\"? Either stop being friends with that person OR take them to Utopia. There's something for everyone I bet. I wouldn't know I only get the fried chicken avocado burrito which is actually more like a wrap. Still real good. Bring your annoying friend they'll love it."}
{"text":"To start with, it doesn't look like much from the outside. There's barely enough room in the front of the place to swing a dead cat, and it's kind of underlit, but it opens up a bit in the back so claustrophobics needn't fear. It has a definite hipsterish feel, at least on a Saturday night around 9:00 before it becomes bar time, and it can get fairly crowded around then so I would recommend shooting for a late dinner, maybe 9:30 or so when the place starts to open up. 

As for the food, well, frankly it's kickass. My date had the tuna panini (which for the record isn't grilled), I had the salmon fish and chips (crusted in panko!!!), and both are strongly recommended.  Shared app was the gourmet poutine, which was a very strong veggie-friendly entry that might have benefited from a touch more cheese. Many very appetizing veggie options are on the menu, without the dead animal selection suffering at all for it. The beer selection leaves a little something to be desired, particularly as the taps go, but it's not as though you can't go take care of that angle after you finish your fine, very reasonably-priced meal; I was, at the time, a  sucker for Kawartha Lakes' Raspberry Wheat, though, so its place on the draught menu meant we were pleased as punch. 

Overall an excellent place to get a bite if you go at the right time and don't mind the environment/lighting."}
{"text":"Cool place... Lousy service and so so food.

Haven't been here in a couple years.  Tried it again today and was sadly disappointed.  Initially we were welcomed warmly and all the as good.  Things deteriorated from there.  Took awhile to get a drink order in... Despite only one other customer inside and the waitress walking right by us.

Finally got the drink order in and a little later a food order.  Drinks were good but the waitress forgot her first item... My girlfriends lemon with her beer.  It's a weird request and many places forget it so it's understandable.

Food took awhile but not a horrendous wait.  But it also came with problems.  My burrito, steak and cheese, was bland.  Good steak, well cooked, but let down by everything around it.  Hoped the hot sauce would help but was left stunned that they are managing to sell bottles of it at all given how bland it tastes.  The final problem was the crunchy rice, I suspect it sat to long drying out in the warmer and not under cooked but can't be sure.  Overall a disappointing meal but for he price I would not be writing a negative review if that was it.

We were mainly there for my girlfriend who loves that type of menu.  But her order was so bad she had to send it back.  She got the chicken & Brie panini with the side upgraded to a poutine.  The sandwich was like a salt lick and the fries came with no curds and gravy.  She tried to catch the waitresses eye for a few minutes but eventually just put the full plate to the side of the table, in plain view, not being eaten for the rest of the meal.  We both finished our beers and I finished my burrito but no one came to check on us.  I eventually flagged a different waiter to wrap up my leftovers and get the bill paid and our waitress turned up.  It was her final words to me that really inflamed my temper.  She told me we should have let her know about the problems...  Guess if we had her cell number, or were willing to chase her down we might have.  But one expects a basic level of service.  To not check on diners post food delivery, or before they're both empty on drinks, and then put the onus on them?!?!? Ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Utopia makes a great casual meal.  I ordered the daily special, which was a lamb burger with goat cheese, apple horseradish relish, wasabi mayo, onions, lettuce and tomato, and a huge side of homemade fries.  My friend ordered the \"Kissing Cousins\" (clever) which was also a lamb burger with goat cheese, but without the wasabi mayo and the relish mentioned above.

Although my burger seemed a little heavy on the goat cheese, the entire combination was a fantastic taste explosion, and I especially enjoyed the generous spread of apple horseradish relish.  My friend also loved his burger, and enjoyed the fresh salad that he had on the side instead of the fries.  My fries were hot and crispy.  I also had a glass of red wine which went great with my burger.  Utopia has a small but reasonable cocktail menu, and 12 or so wines that are available by the glass or bottle.

This was a great experience - the food was hot and delicious, the service was fast, and the environment was comfortable.  My friend did have to send his meal back because the goat cheese had been forgotten, but that was quickly rectified.  We were full for hours afterwards, and the total bill after tax and tip (including my glass of wine) was under $40."}
{"text":"I love Utopia. There's not a long list of reasons why either. I was easily impressed and all it takes is the best homemade veggie burger in town, the crispiest hot french fries, and that they were open late when everything else in Toronto wasn't!

I'm usually not this easy to please, but that damn veggie burger did it!
I can't eat most of the stuff on the menu being vegan, but I still make sure I check out what everyone eats around me... and it ALL looked incredible. This place is reliable. Just forget about the fact that you might have to wait forever on the street depending on what time you go and that you might get snobby looks from the servers. It'll be worth the wait and scowls."}
{"text":"Haven't been here recently but recall an excellent experience, particular their nachos which were packed with toppings and was a generous portion. Restaurant is quite small with a nice patio in the back for the summer nights."}
{"text":"It is with great sadness that I write this review, because based on the poutine alone, I would have absolutely given it five stars. Unfortunately, both of my experiences at this restaurant were accompanied by the terrible service of the manager/server/resident grouchy pants and it completely ruined our impression of Utopia. 

First the good: you've already heard my rave review of the poutine. But there are plenty of other scrumptious options on the menu as well, from brunch items to burgers to veggie options. They also have cocktails, beer, and wine, and a super cute back patio! 

Now to the sour: from the first time my friend and I walked into this place, we received the stink eye from the guy who would end up being our host and server. At first he told us it would be a long wait, then we pointed out the people who were leaving a 2 person table and he reluctantly let us wait to grab it. He was absolutely stone-faced the whole time he took our orders, and when we asked if it was possible to put egg whites on a cocktail that my friend ordered, he looked at us like we were insane. Oh well, we kind of laughed about it and went about enjoying our food. 

The next day, we brought some other friends with us to try this amazing poutine we had, hoping he wouldn't be there. Sadly, he was. When I walked into the place, he straight out told us we couldn't eat there. What if we waited for a table on the street? we asked. Nope. Too crowded and would be crowded for too long. I've never heard a host at a restaurant say it would be unequivocally impossible for us to spend money for their product and service. Who does that?! We walked out of there sad and feeling rejected, and a boutique owner we talked to sympathized with us and suggested we go to Kalendar down the street (review to come soon), where we were treated much more nicely. 

From the crowds and reviews for this place, it looks like the guy doesn't have to worry too much about improving his attitude, but for this two-time visitor it meant a 3-star reduction!"}
{"text":"This place is a winner.

After walking by this spot numerous times, having a couple friends recommend and even having a few order take out, I finally visited the restaurant with a group of friends.

I had a Bison burger, and burritos (including the veggie option) seemed to be a common order at our table. To be able to sit down at a restaurant, a group of people with different diets (veg, gluten free, meat eater) and everyone was happy with their meal.. makes this place a winner."}
{"text":"I came here during some kind of burger week where they had a sausage burger as one of their specials...in all honest I think I expected too much from this place judging by the reviews....it wasn't a bad burger but it wasn't special, nothing spark my taste buds, the portions are huge but I thought that my friends were a bit overcooked...in addition I wasn't informed of a surcharge for coleslaw as the waitress never mentioned it, my first and last time here, too bad"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The vibe is great and we always seem to come back as its open a bit later which is nice!"}
{"text":"Here is my problem, I mean my ONLY real problem, the true bane of my petty existence: I don't eat beef.  But Newton's law has provided me with a simple solution.  One word... Utopia.

No, I don't mean a place that Jude Law escorts me to a room where Johnny Depp is slicing up pieces of aromatic French Cheese to place gently into my mouth only after Matthew McConaughey has finished drawing my lavender-infused bath.  I do mean, however, the restaurant Utopia on cool College St., where you get any kind of burger - veggie, beef, chicken, or lamb - with any kind of topping and condiment you want.  Utopia also has a reasonably priced and abundant selection of burritos -from beef to tuna -, quesadillas, and salads and they are all delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and even though they have a year round patio in the back there are a lot of burger craving hipsters out there and therefore there is, for the most part, always a wait.  So children bring your patient caps with you, it's worth it.

Utopia is, for all intents and purposes, a utopia (I know obvious), at least ,that is, for me."}
{"text":"I've been here four times now. Tons of great options, huge portions, and great price. Some things on the menu are amazing (seared tuna anything), and some are not so great (so many mushrooms in the mushroom, goat cheese, pesto panini. Bread was a bit too cooked as well). 

This restaurant is fantastic for a quick, \"I can't decide\" place because it has so many meat and veggie options. Despite its few shortcomings, as any restaurant would have, it's worth noting that I've never had a bad experience here. Servers are always nice, food always tastes fresh, and vibe is plentiful. But don't get their espresso."}
{"text":"The beautiful Spanish waitress is unfortunately gone and her replacement is not anywhere near as pleasant or personable. But the quality of the food is still amazing. I don't eat here often, but whenever I do I'm always very happy. Their burritos are phenomenal and I always go home with a bottle of their \"OUCH\" homemade hot sauce."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 on a Friday night and had to wait forever for a table (more than an hour, maybe closer to 2h). We were eventually seated in the covered patio section and sat in plastic patio chairs. I didn't wait that long to sit in a plastic patio chair.

I had heard that the nachos were great here, so we got several platters and shared them. They were ok. The chips were burned, and there were notable dry spots without topping coverage. Good topping coverage on nachos is crucial!

Not inclined to return. Too bad."}
{"text":"I realize this place has already been reviewed numerous times, but I had to comment on the \"bad service\" thing here.  I went to Utopia last night for dinner with friends and it was great!  I had to wave down the wait staff a few times but I didn't mind because they were always friendly and fairly prompt afterward with bringing the order. I was expecting terrible service based on the reviews but it wasn't bad at all.  

I shared the Mumahari Dip roasted pepper with pomegranite molasses and walnuts served with grilled naan, the White Bean & Tofu Quesadilla slow simmered white beans & crumbled organic tofu in a spicy southwestern style sauce with cheddar & monterey jack and salsa, and the Chicken Goat Cheese Burrito marinated grilled chicken breast, goat cheese, sweet grilled peppers, grilled onions, lettuce, green onion mayo and salsa...everything was delicious!!!   

Bottom line: if you're in the mood to dine and dash, flagging down the server works wonders and they don't get offended. I think they don't like to rush people; the casual atmosphere isn't necessarily \"bad\" service. The food here was all exceptionally tasty and well-priced for the enormous portions, which are great to share or take home for later."}
{"text":"Utopia is delicious and perfect for those who eat meat and who won't and especially for when those two types of people want to dine together with no compromises! 

The food is cheap and the beer and wine list is decent. The service is also pretty great as the place is fairly small so there aren't many tables to worry about, but that's also the downside since the place is small, you need to show up early or wait a while for seating because they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"It's bad when you come home stinking of grease.

Boiled chicken in a wrap is not a burrito.

Friendly service. Kitchen EXCEEDINGLY slow.

People breathing down your neck standing behind you waiting for a table. 

Loud."}
{"text":"There is nothing particularly wrong with Utopia, neither anything awe-inspiring. Yet, so many people gave them lots of stars - that's fantastic! I guess I've missed something - so here's an opportunity to visit the place once again and maybe finally understand how good it is...

But meanwhile, just my current opinion:

Food? Yes, it was there. And it was ok. But not like I was running in circles and yelling of joy after trying it.

Ambient? Positive, with a pronounced local'ish feeling, like, you expect the people from neighbouring tables know each other.

Service? Polite, a bit on the slower side in our case, but not to be really annoyed.

Portion size? Good enough. Not overwhelming, nah, just absolutely normal.

I guess that \"absolutely normal\" would be my overall mark for Utopia. And that's not bad at all."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and don't feel like cooking head down to Utopia for a decent meal at a decent price. Everything about this restaurant is decent, the service, the location, and the menu. It's great for picky eaters because the menu has a wide variety of staples like burritos, burgers, and salads. I've had the bison burger which was meh and the fried chicken and avocado burrito which was great. For about $15 you can get a burger/burrito and drink, which is super reasonable. I also give the service props for recognizing that my burger was cold and replacing it with a brand new one."}
{"text":"Utopia is another Yelp discovery for me and I'm so glad I found it. Large portions of delicious, simple comfort food that will please vegetarians and meat eaters alike. A casual and fun atmosphere. Reasonable, though not dirt cheap, prices. You can't go wrong.

The menu is large and consists primarily of many variations on burritos, quesadillas, burgers, and sandwiches. There are plenty of options for omnivores and vegetarians. Thankfully, the veggie options aren't your typical hippy rabbit food; no sprouts here.

To start we had the delicious (and vegetarian) poutine ($4.95); tons of gravy and cheese curds on a pile of decent fries. While not the best poutine I've ever had it was damn good and certainly the best veggie poutine.

For mains we ordered the Curried Chickpea & Potato Burrito as well as the Grilled Eggplant Quesadilla. The burrito was basically a huge samosa; good, but after a few bites I wasn't feeling it. The quesadilla was soooo good; perfect grilled eggplants and a delicious sauce.

The portions are huge and you'll definitely be packing up food to take home. Service is not the quickest ever but what's the rush?"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in the city. Service has always been great and the food has always been delicious! I will say that I've had a few experiences with takeout packaging mangling my wrap but it wasn't a big deal for me."}
{"text":"Utopia is definitely a great spot to eat, especially if you're eating with a group who have eclectic taste. The menu is comprised of a slew of delicious apps (TOFU CROQUETTES! ), burgers, burritos and a few mains. I've eaten here many a times and had most of their menu. The burritos are unique and have a gourmet mix of  ingredients (goat cheese and lamb?). The panko crusted salmon is amazing! As is their veggie burger... Most meals come with salad and rice, or coleslaw. These sides are all bad. very very bad. Which is why I'm giving utopia a 3. Their food is great but they really skimp out on providing anything worth eating as a side. 
That being said (bad sides aside) the food is generally consistent and quite a good deal, as most menu items are between 8-13 $. There's a great back patio that's covered and heated in the winter too!"}
{"text":"After arriving to Toronto, I came here with my girlfriend for our first meal thanks to a recommendation from our new roommate. 

The staff was friendly, timely and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was great - big windows on a sunny warm Toronto day gave great light to small hip space with a laid-back vibe. Even the other guests were helpful. 

Being from literally the opposite side of the contenant (Southern California), we were unfamiliar with poutine, something that is rather common here. I've never had it before, but this was awesome. Tip: Do not expect to be hungry after this comes out unless there are at least 3-4 people at your table. I didn't realize how big this would be, nor did I realize how irresistible this would be.

Also had something called a Kissing Cousins burger. Name aside, this lamb burger was just what I was looking for. Goat cheese, some greens and the hot sauce on the table completed this bad boy. Only could eat half of it between the two of us. Took the rest home for a late night snack. 

Overall, this was a lovely introduction to Toronto cuisine. Couple beers and a good meal for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed, for the second time over. 

I know that a lot of people rave and love this place but I don't really get why. As a non-meat eater, my options were not plentiful. Luckily I wasn't hungry and only ordered the small greek salad ($5) this time. I was okay. Last time I went, I had the vege sandwhich and again, was not impressed. I'd rather eat a Subway vege sub over this sandwich. My friend ordered a burger and liked it so perhaps the other options are good especially for the price point. 
If you go here, go here because of the price, not because of the food!"}
{"text":"Since you're reading this, you undoubtedly already know that word-of-mouth is better than any other form of advertising a business can do. Utopia is one of the few restaurants that has repeatedly been highly recommended by friends outside of Yelp for years now. However, it was not until very recently that I finally committed to joining the long disorganized queue out front to find out what all the fuss was about. Boy, was the food worth the wait!  

Despite the fact that the dining room itself is quite small and tight in spots, the weather which was arguably on the very verge of being too chilly still allowed the back patio to be seated as well on the evening of our visit. Luckily, we were able to snag a tiny two-top right beyond the door (and the cool gusts of wind that our server kept sternly telling eager queuers to stay outside and keep out) . The dim mood lighting and great choices of full albums (it was Belle and Sebastien's newest \"Write About Love\" and TV on the Radio's \"Return to Cookie Mountain\" that night) made for an enjoyable atmosphere to chew and chat to.

My super juicy medium-rare 8 oz steak and crispy (as promised) fries were sided with a generous handful of well dressed mixed greens and a large pot of satisfyingly flavourful gravy to dip into. My dinner date's grilled tuna salad was huge and reportedly surprisingly filling.

Although the food and ambiance were excellent, the service was the only thing that wasn't tops. Trying to figure out how the (non-existent) wait list worked outside was something of a puzzle. The guests who dared venture inside to see if they could put their name on a list were immediately (and apparently somewhat rudely) told to go back outside and just wait.

When we dared enter the front door ourselves, we were told firsthand quite abruptly to go back and wait outside. Frankly, we were a little bit confused as we i) had not checked in yet, ii) had seen a table open up, iii) were the next in line, and iv) saw a couple of girls who had just shown up walk right past the line. 

Once seated, our orders were taken and served quickly, but we were never checked on again. No water was ever served and my empty wine glass (which I had wanted refilled) stayed as parched as my throat for the remainder of the meal. By the time we finally got our server's attention to come take away our crusty plates and bring the bill, we had decided to go elsewhere for more drinks.

If you're lucky (or can just look past the service), Utopia does have great food, great ambiance, and fantastic prices."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, particularly the appetizer dip made from red peppers, maple syrup, and pecans.  

However, the practice of ignoring the waiting customers jammed in the tiny entrance in the hopes they will just go away (many did) was a real turn-off.  Yes, you're busy, we get it.  Taking a name so we can leave or telling us how long it might be would be appreciated.  We must have stood in the door for 15 minutes before any staff members materialized to seat us, even though a table had been vacated during our wait."}
{"text":"Oh hey Utopia, what's up? (I also greet my bike this way and any other inanimate objects that I really like) Oh what? You're awesome? I thought so. 

This place is my go to restaurant when I want guaranteed goodness in my belly. I've gone here many times and each experience has been excellent. The staff are friendly despite the constant business and the atmosphere and food make for an enjoyable meal. I've been working my way through the burgers and right now the lamb is my fave. It's pretty popular so expect to wait ten/twenty minutes or so during peak fooding hours. 

Everything great about this place has already been said but I just had to add in my five stars to the mix."}
{"text":"Second time here, same slow service. Waited over half hour before food served. 

We ordered poutine, soup of the day and a burger. And all of them came in cold because the server forget to serve it. He only start serving them when I asked. Obviously forgotten us. 

The food quality is so-so. The tomato soup, is dense and taste like tomato sauce. The poutine is drown with gravy ( especially the bottom of it), and being cold doesn't help. And the burger is alright, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Ordered the omlet special. Big omlet deep fried home fries, salad and suussages. It was a big meal and I enjoyed it. Also the waiter made sure I always had water. And my hangover apprechated it."}
{"text":"The poutine will f'n rocks your socks off. The burger I had was amazing. The atmosphere is awesome and really laid back. Prices won't hurt your wallet. Service was excellent!

I'm looking forward to going back and using their patio. I'll probably make my experience there a lot better (not that I had a bad one!)"}
{"text":"The burrito I ordered has no flavour and was extremely salty. The rice it came with was pretty good however. Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading Utopia to a 3 star.

I went here last weekend for the first time since last summer (I used to be a regular).

Prices have increased....by about $2 on average. Most of the burritos are now $13 plus tax.

The waiting time is just as ridiculous as ever....OH MY GOD. It's agonizing waiting so long for food. I think we waited about 45 minutes this time from placing our order to receiving our food. Combine that with a 30 min wait for a table and a 25 min wait for the waitress to take our order = about 2.5 hours to eat a burrito and salad.

Yes, the food is good, and the price increase would have been justifiable with improved service time, but the waiting is still bad.

Don't get me wrong - the servers are very good here. I'm 100% sure it's the kitchen that is the bottleneck - it's a TINY area that can barely squeeze two chubby hipster chefs working tightly against each other. They need to renovate, increase the kitchen size that can accommodate another 2 chefs. I hope they sort it out."}

Since my first review two months ago, Utopia has become my favourite spot for comfort food by some distance. 
Although the wait times for the food have been a little higher than normal on some days, the service still remains on the good side, and this has especially been true in the back room. 

The food has not disappointed a single time. The goat cheese and fried chicken burritos are both delicious. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the rise/beans side which is pretty subpar, but that's not why you order the dish!

What has really led to the writing of this review however is the Utopia Nachos platter. From the perfectly cooked chunks of steak, to the delicious guac and the cheesy tortilla base, Utopia has managed to consistently serve up the best nachos I've had anywhere. Oh and just to note, this will feed at least two people."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend, reading the reviews that say this place is awesome, and because we had a coupon in the Entertainment Book.

I wasn't expecting the place to be as small as it was, with only a few tables in the front (is a little crowded, and the back being a bit nicer, but I wouldn't call it a patio since it is totally covered. Be warned that this place is quite busy and don't be surprised if you end up waiting.

For our meal I had to try the things that everyone goes all ga-ga over; the poutine, the burger, and the burrito. My wife and I shared the gourmet poutine. The verdict was a positive one. It was really good, although I thought the gravy was a little salty, and the goat cheese gave the poutine a different cheese dimension. After eating this I would like to try the regular poutine to see how cheesy it is.

My wife ordered the Groucho burrito and I had a regular burger. My wife really enjoyed the burrito. It comes with coleslaw made with sesame oil and a bean and rice mix. I found that rice to be very bland. It was kind of dry and felt like it needed a sauce or something on it. As for my burger it was ok. Maybe I'm not as big as a burger fan as I thought, but the burger patty itself seemed to fall apart. That could mean that it was homemade, but I would say for me the burger is average and would rather have the burrito.

This place is a great value for the money you pay for your meals, with portions to make you full after you're done, but I don't share the same sentiment with the many Utopia lovers out there."}
{"text":"So much food, so little money! Great selection. Great place to take vegetarian friends if you yourself are not vegetarian."}
{"text":"Wandered into Utopia randomly and was this a pleasant surprise or what! The place is intimate yet casual; music at a good enough level, and great dim lighting. The menu was extremely vegetarian friendly (jackpot!). And the service was great. 

The onion rings were the best I've ever had. Yes, EVER. Try them with the jalapeno mayo, heaven. They have other flavored options as well, and I'm sure they're all winners. 

We went with the Utopia burger w/ veggie patty and it was huge. They mean it when they say \"heaping portions\" on the website.. we split the one burger between the two of us. The burger itself was great except it was piled high with so many things that some bites were an overwhelming mix of flavors and textures. That said, it did taste good for the most part! I'll definitely go back to try some other combos."}
{"text":"A food-loving friend and I decided to hit up Utopia for a late lunch one weekend, as the menu appealed to our diet restrictions - I'm a vegetarian and she's gluten-free. We arrived and were seated in the back patio area, which we both found incredibly rustic and charming. 

After reading rave reviews about the poutine, I had to try it, and ordered a poutine appetizer followed by the vegetarian souvlaki. Portions are huge and the food was indeed delicious - the poutine lived up to its reputation and my \"souvlaki\" was moist, tender, and well-seasoned.

Our server was a bit abrupt, which was a little unnerving, but she got the job done. I think that the prices are reasonable and there is an extensive selection of options for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I would definitely recommend a meal at Utopia, and look forward to my next visit (hopefully with a friendlier server)!"}
{"text":"Generous portions at a reasonable price? Count me in! Everything on the menu looks sooo good but after dining here, I think their specialties are the giant burritos. I ended up getting the Fried Chicken Dinner and both the chicken and fries were crisp. They were great with the wasabi mayo which provided just a bit of a kick.
I tried the poutine and it was good too, but the gravy wasn't hot enough for the cheese curds to melt, sadface. 

Will definitely be back to try the burritos!"}
{"text":"I visited Utopia Cafe based on the reviews of our fellow yelpers.. I think I have high expectations and I was a little disappointed..

We were there on a Saturday night at around 10 PM, The place was quiet.. no wait.. and we got great services!! Yes the services were excellent, our waitress was really attentive.

The veggie burger we ordered was really juicy.. I think this is the 2nd time in my life to eat a veggie burger. If they all tasted like that, I think I would always order one.

Tzatziki with grilled naan that we order is not too good.. I can eat that, but nothing I get excited about..... the naan was a little burnt.

The portion of the food was huge!! We could not even finish everything....

Maybe next time I would go read through all the previous reviews and takes some notes so I know what better to order!!"}
{"text":"Um. Hello. Heated Patio? Renovated? I'm so there.

Yes, they renovated their heated patio so it doesn't feel like a greenhouse, but like it's just an extension of the actual restaurant! And that means more people can eat there!!! And it's SOOOO good.

Utopia has great burgers, great wraps, great apps and great snacks. Literally my only complaint is that the place gets busy as hell and lineups out the door are common on a Saturday night.

Everyone else has summed up how great it is to be able to pick a burger and make it veggie, beef, bison or lamb, and you know it's delicious no matter which way you go. 

My favourite meal: The Southwestern Burger with poutine and beer. Yeah, I like to get really fat. Apparently the nachos are delicious as well so I'll be trying those next time!"}
{"text":"Utopia is my very own make-shift paradise in which herbivores and carnivores can come together and break bread. My guarantee is that there's something here to please everyone. Head to the back because their patio is lovely. Although it's not as airy on a humid day - it's still more spacious and brighter than the front.

If you're a meat-lover, try their juicy burgers with their fresh ingredients. I love the Kissing Cousins burger. If you're a vegetarian, feel free to sub any burgers for a veggie patty free of charge. Also a must-try is their veggie poutine which is heavenly with its cheese curds and gravy. It's one of my favourite items! I'm also a fan of their Classic Rueben sandwich, grilled cheese (so cheesy!), and curried sweet potato soup. They are so generous with all their portions it's unbelievable! Friends have tried their burritos, salads, and nachos and have said good things.

The servers are friendly, but depending on how busy it gets you may have to wait a while for your food. It's understandable why there's a crowd because they offer some pretty sweet deals. They have $8 lunch specials (soup, sandwich, and side) on Mon-Thurs from 11-3 pm. They also have plenty of dinner specials each day of the week so be sure to check them out before ordering."}
{"text":"I'm upset to rate Utopia this low, but it is absolutely deserved. Utopia was once one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, and a go-to burger spot where the waitress would remember the entire table's orders without writing anything down. My Utopia Breakfast Burger was even featured on Taste Toronto's Instagram a few years back! The service today has gone downhill substantially. There is no care left from the wait staff.
One particular instance, I biked to my sister's house (who lives on Clinton), and wanted to grab a quick burger. I stopped by Utopia, and mentioned to the waiter who was behind the bar that I was looking to grab take out. Before I had asked him, he was literally doing nothing. After I asked, he didn't ask what I wanted, didn't hand me a menu or take my order, instead he went out of his way to refill water at each table at the front and back of the restaurant, and check on patrons. So I sat at the bar waiting for a while for him to come back, which felt like an eternity before I eventually left without being served. I'm guessing it's because I had helmet hair??
I gave that experience the benefit of the doubt, as I came back a few weeks later for brunch. Service was slow and confusing, my drink was forgotten, and getting our check took extremely long. I eventually told the waitress that I'd go to the front to pay because I had an appointment I needed to run to. When I got to the front, it turned out that same waitress took the machine to the back for someone else... more waiting.
If you want a burger for take out, go to Rudy Burger down the street. It's cheaper, faster, and better. If you're willing to sit through slow nonchalant service, come to Utopia. If their service improves, then paying the extra few dollars may be worthwhile. Right now it is not."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 classic burger is the best. Huge. Juicy. Fresh. $9.50

Waiting time: 2/5 . Have to stay in front of ppl for 20 min. 

Place is small

Will come back. it worth it 

:)"}
{"text":"Utopia's still got it. Stopped here on an overcast Saturday afternoon to grab a late lunch and I was thoroughly satisfied by the Utopian experience. Our server picked up on my reluctance to grab a beer, and adroitly suggested a Caesar. Yes! Because I was carb loading for a (as it would turn out, ill-fated) run the next day, I opted for a chick pea and potato burrito. I was gently upsold on adding shrimp to the mix, and was not disappointed.

The burrito was quite unlike any I have had before. It's more like a dosa really; the shell is cooked until it's crispy and it was folded into a smart triangle. They provided a brown tamarind chutney for dipping which was a nice touch. There was also a salad nearby but it was completely unmemorable. You don't win friends with salad, anyway."}
{"text":"Massive portions. Full of flavour and real well priced. Doesn't feel too fresh but we enjoyed the atmosphere. 

Service was a bit slow. It took about 30min to get our food. 

Overall a good spot."}
{"text":"Utopia is one of those places where you can never really go wrong! Their menu selection is pretty extensive, with options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, like some others have mentioned. You won't just get your average burger or burrito here, gourmet toppings and unconventional fillings make these meals well worth the already inexpensive price. 

And yes, it's usually packed, and yes you will usually have to wait, but I'd say that's a mark of a good restaurant. It's gotta be worth it if everyone wants in, right? Their patio area is a bonus in the warmer months, and it's the perfect place to spend a few hours devouring a delicious meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Portions are very generous. 

We ordered Steak nachos which were great, but took more than 30 min to arrive.

I ordered the burrito which was great, but the rice and coleslaw that came with it were pretty bad. It also took forever to come, we waiting a LONG time.

All in all the food is decent, but the service is EXTREMELY slow. Be prepared to spend at least 1 hour from the moment you order your main course till you're served.

The problem of this place may be the kitchen...?. Seems very small for a restaurant that size.

Waitstaff weren't bad, not too friendly but not bad either.

Although the food was OK, it's not worth the wait. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"File under One More Thing About Canada That I love.  Basically, file it under O unless you have a section with just a shimmering red heart drawn on the tab with a gel pen.

I am currently in Toronto for a few days for work.  One night #2 my boyfriend and I headed to Utopia based on a reco from a pescatarian friend of mine.  I knew when I saw the solar power lighting and the line out the front door that I was about to have a Double Rainbow Moment, or #drm.

Vegetarian restaurants full of beautiful people, odd hipsters, and good wine always make me happy.  When the food is delicious it's an even bigger win.  What can I say?  WINNER WINNER TOFU DINNER!!!!!

The vegetarian poutine was STUPID GOOD.  Three days later I'm still thinking about it.  The tofu and white bean quesadilla?  Spicy enough to be a party on my tongue, but mild enough to not require any watering down to get it down the hatch.  And don't even get me started on the tofu cream croquettes.  Ordinarily not a fan of fried food, I demolished two of the croquettes and secretly hoped my boyfriend would see how much I liked them and donate one of his to my cause.  He did not, but last week he bought me a KitchenAid, so I can't hold a grudge.

The vegie burger actually DID resemble meat.  It was not the best vegie burger I've ever had in my life (I like mine a bit more puffy and eclectic with things like beets and chickpeas backed in), but it was a solid 7 or 8 out of ten.

We got the bill for our 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees and it only came to $48.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  There was only one appropriate response: We went back the next night.

On night #2 we both got burritos and shared the squash soup.  The soup was mind blowing.  The burritos were healthy and toasted.  I like my burritos a bit more bloated, calorie-laden, and steamed.  I think that's just a Toronto burrito vs. San Diego burrito thing.  Overall the meal was a 9 out of 10.

I'm still in Toronto and going somewhere else tonight, but you know what...I'm sitting at work at 3:53pm and all I can think about is that effing poutine.  I think I might have a 3rd trip to Utopia in me before I head back stateside."}
{"text":"Went here because I was really craving Nachos and blogto listed it as one of \"Toronto's best.\" I find blogto can miss the mark sometimes picking trendy over yummy but they were right with this one. Got the Utopia Nacho's and was not disappointed. HUGE plate of Nachos you will want to share. Layered cheese, chicken steak, beans, fried jalapeño peppers, guac, salsa and sour cream. I may have missed some toppings. Anyhow, the chicken was great and seasoning was good but I really have to comment on the steak, both my partner and I thought it was phenomenal as a topping, tender, not at all chewy and super yummy I think i'd order steak nacho's if I came here again. 

Food aside, atmosphere was great and cozy. Service was good. A bit of a wait but it was a Friday night with no rezo's. Maybe waited 10 min for a table of 2? Fun part of town also. 

Price was good Nachos, 3 beers and a glass of wine was around 47. 

That is all I can think of! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Utopia and I have gone straight from second base to home plate - yesterday they kicked things up several notches with the ultimate: GOURMET POUTINE.

Seriously - the most solid poutine (meat or otherwise) I've ever had. Mushrooms (how they managed to make ME like mushrooms is still a mystery) and goat cheese on top of a mountain of veggie gravy, cheese curds and perfectly crispy fries for only $6.95. The appetizer portion is enough food for four people. The kitchen is open till 1am, so go here after a College Street crawl and satisfy your poutine craving!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here occasionally since I lived nearby in Kensington Market (mid-2000's). I used to love this place - it had a funky, casual charm about it and decent food. But I came here recently and it's like it changed drastically...probably the newer menu (the old one was paper, the new one laminated with fewer choices). Portions seemed smaller than they used to, and blander. The service was never really that good whether it was busy or not, but at least you could fill up on its pub-style food. The back patio is dark and depressing so I prefer the main seating area. The burritos used to come with a good rice and salad side, now it just comes with the runty salad. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and seemed more like a pita, the sweet potato and other ingredients all mushed up and indistinguishable inside. My friend's fries were jagged, small and borderline burnt. The burgers looked puny and frozen compared to the restaurant's heyday. Something is amiss, which is saddening because this place used to be such a joy to eat in. I hope they get their sh*t together and bring it up to standard!"}
{"text":"Utopia, or Utops, as I lovingly call her is always there for me. 

She has a bit of an identity crisis going on, but who doesn't. This place has tex-mex, veggie, comfort food, burgers, and more. It's a huge menu. I've never had anything bad here, and I especially enjoy their veggie gravy poutine and various types of quesadillas. 

Last night I went here with friends and had the fried chicken and avocado burrito. It was delicious, but I always forget I don't really like their coleslaw (sesame oil-y) or their rice (not spicy like other tex-mex rice, often undercooked.) They let you sub in other things at minimal costs, so this is totally my bad for being disappointed in my sides (again). 

The service here is always good, though last night was a bit strange. Our server was quite twitchy... and worked at a wizard-like speed. Example: I asked for a side of sour cream, and ten seconds* after asking one of my supper mates said \"I'm going to ask for a side of guac.\" I replied \"Get him when he comes back with my sour cream.\" She then pointed out that he'd already dropped it next to my plate without me noticing. How. Did. He. Do. That?! I literally gasped.

This place was a fancy date night in Uni when I was super-poor, and is a wallet-safe night out with friends now that I am slightly less poor. Enjoy!

*Slight exaggeration."}
{"text":"I've always been skeptical when walking by this place. It wasn't until I came here for brunch with a friend that I was pleasantly surprised. The front part of the restaurant is tiny but there is a covered back patio space which is huge. Plus the drinks selection and menu intrigued me. 

Brunch was pretty good and affordable. I'm excited to come back here again to try more of the menu and to get my drink on. 

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Service is usually pretty slow, but the food is fab! They serve up a delicious vegetarian poutine and the rest of the menu is pretty good as well. Its a great place for lunch, if you have the time."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and food at this place. The nachos and the bison burger are highly recommended. Service is prompt and courteous. Might have to go earlier on the weekends, otherwise be prepared to wait in the doorway or out front."}
