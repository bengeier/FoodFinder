{"text":"Fresh cool and fast, percent for hot summer day when you need something quick easy.  I like the variety of meat options compared to Ahi Poki bowl, plus they have lobster as an option & three different size bowls.  The sauces are unique the spicy wasbi I as very delicious"}
{"text":"The Veggie bowl was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! The staff was friendly and the restaurant was very clean!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to see what's going on here and was pleasantly impressed with the freshness of all of the food items. Fresh fish, across the board. Sampled the lobster ( a must get) among other fish and you can taste the freshness with every bite. 

Today is day one and I recommend Koi if you like sushi and healthy eating. The nice thing here is you can pile on healthy greens, vegetables, and fish on a bed of white or brown rice.

Chris thanks for your outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Probably the best poke place I've tried! Fresh ingredients and impeccable service, what more could you ask for! 10/10 would recommend and come again!"}
{"text":"We have a winner! As the race for the best poke in Gilbert seems to be in full swing, Koi has definitely  taken the lead - soundly. The bases are more diverse - shredded kale, shredded brussel sprouts along with the rice and standard mixed greens. For the gluten free crowd that has been feeling frustrated at the lack of GF options, this place has you covered. Nearly everything is gluten-free with the exception of the crab salad and seaweed salad. The place where they really show the next level is in their proteins which include lobster with champagne butter. The customer service is outstanding, the drinks are healthy and delicious. Also, getting a big thank you from the customers is their rewards program that keeps track of how often you come in and the bowls you buy. Thank you, Koi! This has been sorely lacking in the Poke craze. Definitely a fan, definitely coming back, and definitely plan on being a regular."}
{"text":"With all the new poke joints opening up I could not remember if I had been to Koi previously. Then I realized Koi only had 5 reviews and was told it had only been open for 1 week. It deserves stellar reviews and I hope it is around for the long term.

A medium bowl will get you 3 generous scoops of protein and Koi is the only place I know of that has LOBSTER ($4 extra). I will indulge in the future. The other protein options were the usual tuna, marinated tuna, salmon, shrimp, octopus, tofu, yellowtail (extra) and probably a couple of things I am missing. At 9pm on a Saturday night everything was still fresh.

Koi is very generous with their toppings, you can have as much of everything as there is no limit. This is also a plus. The only extra charge is $2 for avocado. A couple of unique toppings are kale and shaved brussels sprouts which are quite tasty!

Most poke joints are missing a decent beverage selection with only a soda dispenser. Koi has 4 varieties of freshly brewed iced teas (besides the soda machine). I am in love with the blackberry green tea! I also noticed cold pressed juices in their refrigerator. 

Koi has only been open 1 week and is impeccably clean. The staff is super friendly and there is a rewards program. I will definitely be coming back. The prices are also cheaper than other poke places."}
