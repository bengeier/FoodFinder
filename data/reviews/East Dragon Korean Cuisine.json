{"text":"Sham!  Yet another korean restaurant owned,  runned and ruined by Chinese. This is my second time here. The first time was here it was bearable. Was in the area second time around. I had to use my hand sanitizer to clean the table because it was filthy. They have manually written on each of their menus price increases. Our cokes were warm like they were sitting the box and took them out. I asked for Kimchi fried rice and they said they were out of Kimchi.   Out of Kimchi? No true korean establishment would be out of Kimchi. So my husband ordered spicy squid with rice and I opted for the LA galbi Bento box. Pathetic serving of banchan consisting of 4 pieces of daikon scoop of tasteless mashed potato salad and glass noodles with no seasoning. My hubby's dish came out extremely fast and they served him immediately.  Bland,  watery,  no sense of Korean spices detected. My food finally arrived in a traditional bento box that was half empty. 5 small iceberg lettuce pieces with a small clunk of some sort of salad dressing,  gigantic amount of rice,  galbi that was cut up and was the saddest,  thinnest I've ever seen with no marinate topped with a quail egg and a slice of orange. Fried egg on top of LA galbi?   Anyways,  neither of us finished our meals and didn't leave a tip. Never going back. If I could give him no stars I would."}
{"text":"Used to be decent a couple of years ago...

But, prices have gone up, food quantities have gone down, the extra niceties are barely there, and the quality has gone to the grave...!!!"}
{"text":"Truly 2.5 stars.  Appears that management has changed and the hours of operation have also changed and not displayed anywhere for the customers to see.  The portion size has gone down and even the noon existent service has also taken a nose dive.  Many of the listed items are not available and hope they realize what they are doing sooner than later."}
