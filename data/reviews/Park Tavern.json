{"text":"I wouldn't go here ever again was invited wish just stayed at the Niko's across the way the Tavern is a dirty place the staff are clueless and rude food is yuk and tastes like S_ _T staying far away from this place a guy was drunk peeing by the entance by cars disgusting place full of Trashy employees."}
{"text":"This place has the best patio bar in North Royalton.  The staff is very friendly and the food is really good!  The new owners are bringing this place back to a top notch local bar!"}
{"text":"The Park Tavern is within walking distance from my apartments which means I go there from time to time instead of risking a DUI heading elsewhere.  (although there are plenty of cops on this corner waiting for people from other bars to pass.)  It has a pool table with one fair condition stick, the rest as of right now have no tips.  The crowd is mostly older and folks.  I have not had the food but i hear it is tasty.  Music selection is good for a jukebox.  Bartenders are often nice and accommodating.

There is a new patio out back that looks awesome for when it finally warms up.  I think there will even be a bar out there. Looking forward to checking it out"}
{"text":"Owner is an ass....it's Tuesday the taco and nacho special ended at 5 but he sits next to me eating the special.    I know as an owner it's your right. NOT. Bar is packed barmaid behind everyone waiting for food and drinks as he sits.  Step up buddy!   All these people will walk out while you sit and talk to the drunk guy."}
{"text":"I will rate the customer service since i didnt even get to order any food since the server never came back to take my order"}
{"text":"Quite neighborhood bar.  Really nice outdoor patio!!!  Cheap drink prices (except shots).  Beer list could be better.  Friendly, attentive bartenders. The food looks good, but I haven't eaten here yet."}
{"text":"Getting anything here is impossible. Always out of what is ordered and the service is slow. Wait staff seems to struggle even with the place half full. The only upside is a nice patio and bar setup."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, and awesome staff! Such a cool hidden bar away from the busy mall."}
{"text":"We came across this place trying to kill some time between appointments. Best Burger Ever All Time !!! everything we ordered was fantastic including the best perogies I ever had. We will return often!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service started out with great service by server Desiree she checked in on us frequently as did other staff.  The food came out a bit slow but definateky was worth it.   I would have taken a picture of chicken quesadilla but I ate it!  The pepperoni added a great touch. Did I mention husband enjoyed jalapeno burger and his dollar draft."}
{"text":"My first experience at this bar was this past Saturday.  I live in the adjacent subdivision and this bar is literally about 100 meters from my backyard.  Couldn't ask for a better location for a decent drinking hole than that.  Wife and I walked there and although the place wasn't all that lively, I liked it.  I liked the ambiance, the interior design, the relatively comfortable seating and the friendly bar tenders.  However, and you all knew this was coming, there was (is) this douchebag, supposedly a bartender, that was acting like a total fool, cussing about various things (loudly), kept changing the music to his liking, and just being loud and obnoxious like he was on something.  I saw him drinking as well which looked to be alcoholic but I can't be sure.  If he was on the clock and drinking, then I'm puzzled as to why he's allowed to do that.  He may have been off-shift, but he was going behind the bar making drinks for himself and changing music like he owned the place.  On a good note, the food was okay and the two young bar tenders that served us was excellent.  My wife and I want to love this place and frequent it often, but if that idiot is there the next time we go, that's it!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times the food was great and the service was too. Between the four who went we have had two types of wings, burgers and the French dip. All were excellent as were the fries.
Nice indoor and outdoor seating. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the place I like to go when I want to feel like I'm bothering the bar tenders by asking for a drink."}
{"text":"I always stop when i go to strongsville mall. Mickey is my favorite bartender in the area. She is about her business and i love her swag! Food is good but the frosty drafts are my best friends!"}
{"text":"Love Park Tavern. Had the best black and blue burgers tonight on special for only $8.  Cheers to the chefs Anthony and Jaime.  Really good onion rings as well.  Great service with Karli.  We'll be there back!"}
{"text":"Be aware of your final bill, this place double charged us for food and drinks that our friends already paid for before they left, then the bartender had told us not to worry because he charged them for our bill, we didn't feel that was right but knew we would could pay them back when we seen them. So when we wanted to leave we received our final bill, we had everything that our friends already paid for and we called them to find out what their bill was and it was the same bill that we were being charged for, so needless to say we thought we had a new hang out, but will never step foot into this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"The food was great and it's a very nice neighborhood place to hang out. We had the French dip and bacon burger- both were outstanding. The staff was friendly, but not very observant as far as providing timely service/refills. Other than that, it's a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Went last night with some friends. Sat for 15 minutes without acknowledgement. Had to ask for menus. Another 15 minutes to get a beer. Order onion rings which were way too expensive for what you get ($9). Food was okay nothing special. If my kid is skating I'll stop for a beer but I don't think I'll go out of my way to stop specifically for dinner."}
{"text":"We were scouring yelp looking for a new place to go to and found the Park Tavern. Wasn't sure since it was apart of the Ice Arena but it was actually pretty nice and you really didn't notice (unless you went and looked) that they were together. 

The location is nice and the inside is modern and updated. They have a decent size patio with the fancy garage doors that open up to the bar where you can also sit. While we were there there was a live band outside. The band was pretty good and the type of music was enjoyable, HOWEVER it was WAY TOO LOUD! We were sitting at the bar, inside, and as far from the music as you could get and kept saying how it wasn't even worth trying to have a conversation with how loud it was. Even the staff was having difficulty talking without asking again. We initially wanted to sit outside but were glad there weren't seats with how loud it was. 

We went just to get some beers but also got the chips and dips appetizer. The pita was really good and we LOVED the hummus! It was on point.  They also had an olive tapenade dip that was great. The tzatziki was good but nothing special, especially after it got warm. 

The regular menu was outdated the waitress said, so most the drinks on it they didn't have as listed. So that was kind of weird. Someone down the bar got chicken fingers from the kids menu and they looked so good and were also the largest kids portion I've ever seen! (That's what I'd get if we went again!)

Overall, we were surprised with how nice the location was and it didn't feel like you were at the ice arena. There was a big park nearby and it is dog friendly here. We just had beer and one appetizer but were happy with both. They had live music on this Saturday, however it was WAY to loud. The music being to loud and the menu being outdated were a bit disappointing because we couldn't hang out as friends without yelling and didn't know what they actually had. I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again in the future and giving it another shot. This is a good family atmosphere and there were a few family's there with the kids tagging along with a Shirley temple or two ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local \"dive\" bars. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside screams \"welcome home\". They don't have much to offer for craft beer, but they always keep a tap handle of Rhinegeist \"Truth\" IPA available, which I find to be one of the best IPA's brewed in Ohio. The food is standard bar fare, but plenty tasty and very reasonably priced. Plenty of parking, but seating can become scarce once a few groups of people show up. Live music and karaoke nights round out the entertainment. All in all, a good place for an evening with friends"}
{"text":"A nice little neighborhood bar & grill in North Royalton. It has a unique patio in the rear of the building. With mature trees and a cool outside bar with an enclosed big screen television. The patio could use a little polish though. It is a bit cluttered and unkempt. 
The inside is typical for a neighborhood pub,  with an L-shaped bar, and lots of tables. Plenty of TV's and a cozy vibe. The food is good and plentiful. The prices are reasonable. 
The only thing that limits my rating to 4 stars is the DISGUSTING urine soaked men's restroom. With a single urinal,  a single toilet stall (that's missing it's door), no lock for a single person sized restroom. There is also no soap in the men's room! Which is essential for such a filthy  restroom. Seriously people... fix your men's room! 
When a public use facility is that dirty,  it makes me think... \"How clean could the inaccessible kitchen be?\". 
I'm told the women's restroom is the opposite,  clean & well stocked. I think I'll use that one next time I go there..."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood bar this is IT! Perfect for a bite to eat with a couple drinks on the weekend or quick stop in while in AZ Ice. Just opened within the month and so far have gone twice! Also Crossroads Park has a dog park so it's perfect to come in and sit on the patio with the pups!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but worth the visit. Nice bar and dining area. Large patio. On Saturday they had a band playing. Nice chill spot. Good selection of beers on draft. We sat at the bar Ellie served us. Very Fast and friendly service. We never had to wait to get a drink. Ellie recommended the turkey burger which I ended up ordering. It was really good. My friend had the tavern burger he said was good also. Cool spot I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where you can act as 'silly' as you want and no judgements are passed.  If you're in the area, it's an interesting place to check out.  They're not trying to impress anyone, but they get the job done."}
{"text":"We sat for almost ten minutes and seemed invisible and watched several staff members look at us but none acknowledged us.  Finally got our order placed and the waitress literally carried one drink at a time to our party of five.  The bathroom is shared with the ice skating rink and to say they are filthy would be kind.  Finally the check came and it was near Vegas pricing,  crazy for what we got.  First and last time here."}
{"text":"99 cent steak Wednesday was like finding 5 bucks in your pocket as you do this week's laundry.  Needless to say, it was a pleasant surprise. 8oz sirloin strip steak cooked to order and correctly I might add. You do have to buy two sides which actually at minimum is $1.25 each. So a steak meal for $3.50 is alright with me. The steak is actually a decent cut of meat. It was actually a better steak than Vegas's Hard Rock hotel's steak special. The bar tender was very nice. Guy in the bar offered to get us popcorn out of the popcorn machine since he was getting some for himself. Very friendly. Bar inside is an old school typical bar setting with TV and juke box. Outside has a nice patio to enjoy warmer weather when we get it here in Cleveland. I'm coming here again for more steak. Found out they have specials like this everyday. 25 cent beers during browns games. I may have found a new hang out.  Viva Park Tavern."}
