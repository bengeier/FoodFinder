{"text":"Restaurant has a very cool rustic vibe. I had the Cobb salad which was super fresh and huge. Also, French fries are amazing! Great place if you want to bring your dog as the patio is pooch friendly!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. totally disappointed. Our poor server was so nervous and had to go find out the answer to any question we asked (how is the fish prepared, what do you have for dessert, do you have any sauce for this, etc.) his answer for how the fish is prepared... \"the chef said they just throw it on the grill with some salt and pepper\" REALLY! The Cesar salad was drenched in dressing that did not have the bite of cesar dressing...more of a flavorless ranch. My salt and pepper fish was actually good, boring but good after I got a lemon to squeeze on it but the dessert tasted old and very pre made (some peanut butter brownie that had zero peanut butter taste). We overheard another server telling his table that they have had to revise the menu a few times because of all the complaints they got and that is why none of the servers know anything. yikes. On a positive note, the place is gorgeous, fabulous job decorating and creating a cool ambience. Too bad the food didn't match the great décor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food for date night, a family night out, or to watch a game at the bar!  And what REALLY stands out to my wife and I after multiple visits is the superior service from the staff!  We've had a different server each time, and they've all really done a great job to make sure we had an excellent experience every time! We'll definitely keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"We had seen this restaurant and it looked nice.  The menu online looked good.  We know a couple who had eaten here and enjoyed it. Due to our schedule, our nights eating together are limited, and we decided to give B&B a try.  From the minute we walked in, it was a disaster.  They were confused where to seat us.  The table wobbled and it took a good 15-20 minutes to have it corrected.  We ordered dinner, and they came back 5 minutes later stating they were out of baked potatoes (on a Saturday evening at 6 PM?  Potatoes?), so we made another selection.  20 minutes later they brought either someone else's dinner to us or a completely wrong order.  10 minutes later, they told us that they had made a mistake with my meal and were re-making it now and would redo my wife's ribs.  At that point, we figured they would just toss her already cooked ribs back in the oven.  We left without eating after an hour.  The restaurant itself was only about 40% full on a Saturday night as we were leaving, and things started to make sense.  The servers and manager were friendly and apologetic throughout, which was nice, but to make that many mistakes in one dinner at a nice restaurant is inexcusable."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations.

Beautiful restaurant.

However...

Stopped in for happy hour, the beer seemed very warm and somewhat flat.  Probably having some problems with refrigeration, but we're also in Arizona so I gave them a pass on this.

We ordered the happy hour mussels and chicken wings.  Disastrous.  

A good number of the mussels had cracked shells so  We didn't know if they were pried open or just roughly handled.  The texture of the mussels were chewy and the flavor was extraordinarily \"fishy\" and somewhat funky.  Maybe they were woefully overcooked or maybe I should have known better by ordering mussels when it's 95F, it's Scottsdale and it's a sunday.  Did not finish the dish because it wasn't worth the risk.

The wings had a good texture, but had all of the spice and flavor of a BF Goodrich tire.  The only time in history I've actually considered adding salt to Buffalo wings just to get a little zip.  Texture good, flavor terrible and well, overcooked.

Mediocre, expensive experience and I'm glad we didn't order entrees because if the appetizers were this marginal, I'm sure the steak would be as well.

Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"This was our first visit with many more to come.  We were met and seated immediately by Chelsea who turned out to be a marvelous waitress.  I ordered my usual Gin Martini that sets up my palate (Ahem!), we then ordered sandwiches for lunch with soup and fries on the side.  Now, you can go to any sandwich shop and order a burger or french dip; however, these orders were special and prepared perfectly.  My wife enjoyed her beef soup and the French dip.  I ordered the house favorite Ale House Burger that I just loved, the beef, the bacon, the carmilized onions and the cheese just meshed into the most delectable flavor.  The restaurant itself is large and really classy with modern décor and divided into four areas of your choice; Bar and lounge area, regular dining area, group or party dining room, and a large patio; choose your spot to enjoy your individual desired dining experience.  The dinner menu offers a variety of entrees that sound delectable.  We will be back with our friends; we just have to share a good thing when we find one.  Wonderful place, wonderful people and wonderful food; what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and was looking forward to it. This is a cool place with good ambience and music. The 'host' guy that seats people was a super snob and purposely rude and talking down to us. The rest of the staff was fine."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for so long, wish I had not waited!  Love the contemporary atmosphere.  Started with a blackberry mule (yummmmmy!) then had the steak salad.  I am not usually a big beef eater but this was so good!  I will be back for more.
P.S. Bathrooms were cool as was the decor and flooring too (hey, these things are important to me!)
P.P.S.  Forgot to mention the service, great!  Very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Went with friends for a very early New Year's Eve dinner, warm reception and prompt seating. The starters were good (soup of the day- broccoli & blue cheese, corn chowder, tomato bisque. Entrees (rib eye, short ribs, both with charred Brussels sprouts, meat  loaf with mac&cheese, bleu burger with Caesar salad) were all tasty but the presentation was plain and boring. Our server, David, was excellent but because of the upcoming party crowd we felt rushed. 
It's in my neighborhood so would definitely return."}
{"text":"Really love this place, great staff always happy  at the bar Mike,Danny Krysten and Sabrina are some of the best In the valley. Food is good had brunch land it was very yummy. Also have live music on Wednesday and some weekends  managers are good and it has a new owner great guy.
The one manager is a bit rude (David) not sure why he's on the floor, never says hi or welcome and is very rude (must not like Scottsdale or his job lol) the happy place lol"}
{"text":"Be advised of bait and switch at happy hour.  And they pour you $17.00 glass of wine instead of happy hour $5.00.."}
{"text":"Ok this is my first time writing a yelp review. After visiting Black & Bleu for the second time I just had to say something. This place has great ambience,and consistently great food.  The crab cakes are the best I've ever had. The Salmon was cooked to perfection You have your choice of indoor or outdoor seating.  The wait staff are super friendly. This place  is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"I visited this amazing American grill today...I had the half chicken which is smoked in house has to be one of the best chicken dish in town! Boy it was enormous!  I will definitely be coming back and the servers were great too :)"}
{"text":"We went to Black and Bleu for Easter Brunch.  The restaurant was beautiful, however it was evident quickly that they were not prepared.  They had mimosas ready and plenty of beverages.  However, they had a table full of room temperature and clearly purchased bread products and a fruit tray.  They had an omelet station with two burners and a line of 8-10 deep waiting to order an omelet.  They had a table for waffles, but there were no waffles ready.  They were clearly being made in the back kitchen one by one and being brought out. Lastly they had a pork and prime rib carving station with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. All of which was cold, not room temperature because it's on a burner, no cold.  My first pass at the brunch warranted a plate of fruit and an untoasted plain bagel with cream cheese. Needless to say we will not be returning and I can not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to B&B.  We loved the atmosphere and the acoustic guitar with Neil Diamond songs which catered to the mixed-age crowd there for Happy Hour.  

On the personnel side: everyone we met in person was terrific!  However, we made a phone reservation earlier in the day with a rather scattered-sounding young man, and not surprisingly (given his casual surfer dude conversation style), it was not recorded in the restaurant's digital bookings.  No problem for Natasha, the hostess.  She couldn't have been more accommodating and seated us in a booth, which we preferred.  She also told the Business Manager that we were first time customers, and he stopped by to say welcome, which was a nice touch!  Bobbie Jo, our server, was attentive, professional, and very friendly.  Although she was busy covering most of the seating in the front of the bar area, she stopped by to see how we were doing several times.  Even the young men who delivered our dinners and wrapped up my leftovers were very friendly and said goodbye when we left.  This made the dining experience very pleasant and relaxing!!

Regarding the food:  This was a mixed bag for us.  First, there was no Prime Rib (we were told that they didn't get it on the smoker early enough to be ready??), and my husband really wanted to try it.  Second, the Rib Eye Steak, though priced upwards of $25 was small and thin.  Can't remember whether the ounces were quoted on the menu, but they should be so that diners are prepared for the petite size of the cut.  Having said that, by husband said it was cooked to his preference and delicious tasting.  The Pork BB Ribs were excellent, and they spanned the length of the plate, so much so that they dwarfed the rib eye steak my husband had.  They were falling off the bone and nice and smoky. 

It was a $100 tab for the two of us, with one happy hour-priced appetizer, two small dinner salads, 2 entrees, and 3 drinks @ $11/ea.  Maybe a 3 $$$ restaurant?  

We will definitely return to B&B and hopefully get to try the prime rib and one of the delicious-sounding salads."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, we have had a couple of really bad experiences here.  BUT, the food is excellent the place is beautiful and 9 out of 10 of the servers are amazing.  The management has always done an amazing job at correcting any situation that arises.  It is local, it is fun, it is new and it has growing pains and we get it.  We go 1-2x a week and will continue to.  The filet bites are the best, the Black and Blue burger, wedge and beef steak tomato!  YUP!  Wish they didn't get rid of the shrimp cocktail and probably a little soon to increase prices, but it won't stop us from going.  We bring people all the time.  They try hard all of the time.  Give them a chance and if they get it wrong, give them a chance to get it right...cause they will!  And ask for David, cause he is the Bomb!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was better then than it is now! During the so called \"rocky opening,\" someone else referred to, management was on their game and the restaurant seemed very well-put-together, organized, and ready for business! That's most definitely a different story now! I don't know what happened with the management and just staff in general that was there in the beginning but it's all gone way down hill. Just like the other two restaurants in that complex, Stone & Vine, and Salt & Lime I think it's called, service is horrible and staff clearly has no direction from their leaders! Restaurant is in shambles and not to mention the fact that they've changed their menu countless times now - that tells me there's some serious work that needs to be done in back of the house as well! I don't think I'll be going back - already have been there three times now and clearly nothing seems to be getting better. In addition, I find that with management struggling to get this restaurant off the ground, maybe they should work on actually doing that and not standing around socializing and sitting at the bar - yes, management sitting at the bar. Only glim of hope: the 4 of us ate for around $100 and the food was decent. I wish them luck but overall, it generally is not worth the trip and definitely not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Black and Bleu is one of our family's favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous but the servers are truly the heart of the restaurant. They go out of their way to make sure you have the best experience possible. Brandon is an amazing server that gives my daughter special attention every time we are there. Brandon takes service to the next level. If you want great food, great drinks and a fun environment you must check out Black and Bleu. Ask for Brandon! Mike, Addison and Ky are great servers too! 

Food Recommendations: Caesar Salad, Cobb Salad, Salmon BLT and Filet bites are a must!"}
{"text":"Great place in several regards
1. Good $6 kids meals (though only 4 choices) with drink
2. Best burgers around - my fav is the Hatch burger
3. Great french fries
4. Great beer
5. Superb patio (apparently it is dog friendly too though rarely see dogs there)
6. Thursdays burger meal + 22 oz draft beer for $13"}
{"text":"I guess the measure of any restaurant is how often you go back. Well, I first visited Black & Bleu a few weeks ago after it opened. It was good, not great. 

Went back a few weeks ago and something changed. The ribs appetizers are unbeatable. Steaks and fish are A to A+. Salads are on it. Service impeccable. 

Been back 5 times since I went there are a second time and I can see the crowds growing steadily. If you like a good social crowd, go to hang out in bar area on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. Great spot that's getting discovered fast."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant under the recommendation of a friend who lives in the area, being from Southern California myself  I had no idea what to expect. So excited to report we found an absolute gem in Black and Bleu. My husband and I had an amazing experience. We each had the Ahi salad and it was incredibly fresh and delicious. The wAiter Paul was extremely attentive to our every need making us feel like we were VIP. I've never been to a restaurant where the waiter made food suggestions to us that literally made us want to order one of everything he spoke about.  Can't wait to visit the area again because this will be our first stop when we come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by the bar for a drink after dinner (elsewhere) on April 19.  Initial service was great.  A little slow with the bill.  Got a message from my credit card company stating I had left a 15.00 tip for a 12.95 bill.  I did not leave that.  I left a message on Black and Bleu phone and got no response.

Update:  Lexie worked with me to credit my card $15.00."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Dallas and expected only a mediocre steak, but what I received was an amazing cut of beef cooked to perfection! I ordered the ribeye which is a hearty 12oz, so come hungry. Their signature drink the Black Martini is also amazing! I will be back! Please branch out to Dallas! Amazing service Erica!"}
{"text":"Our first time and we are impressed. We each had a burger...the black & blue and the hatch chili, both were delish. Great fries too. Love the decor and we had a very good server! We'll come back!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! Our server Bobbi Jo was wonderful and the food and drinks were delicious. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal.  Recently my husband & I met a friend for dinner.  She had never been to Black & Bleu, and we wanted to try out the new dinner menu.  The appetizers we ordered were great (we are huge fans of the pretzel bites and the Ahi crudo), and the dinner selections were delicious as well.  My husband and friend both ordered the Alehouse Burger, which they enjoyed.  We have ordered the filet & the short ribs in the past, and both have always been well prepared.  I would suggest checking Black & Bleu out soon  They have new lunch and brunch menu's if you can't make it in for dinner.  They also have live entertainment several nights a week, as well as lots of TV's for all of you sport lovers!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location several times in its past iterations, not so good.  What a pleasant surprise to eat there today!  My Cuban sandwich was better than most I've had in Florida.  It was so good, in fact, that, even though I was quite full after the first half, I are the whole darn thing, just because it was so delicious!  My husband really enjoyed his beef quesadilla as well.  Our server, Lisa, was delightful.  we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered Take out from here. My jumbalaya was a Joke and my boyfriend steak wasn't any better. Let's just say my order was $72 & I ended up throwing it out after the first bite. NEVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"Twice here.  First time went on a Saturday...no happy hour :-(  but the other places in that location have happy hour.  Anyway, I ordered the baked clams which I did not care for, the overpowering flavor of tomato paste left literally a bad taste in my mouth.  When asking the wait staff about the menu, the place etc.  they were clueless  

Second time was a bit better, the sliders had quality meat, just needed flavor.  No drinks on happy hour menu, just beer and wine.  

Will try one more time."}
{"text":"Have eaten in the bar twice now.   Food is very good but service is spotty.  First time it was great so we came back. Second time on a Sunday night it was very weak. Definitely need some improvement in this area."}
{"text":"First let me say, I have never taken the time to write a review on anything ~ but for some reason this place torqued me besides just being disappointed after coming here with a date on a Friday (1-21-2015) and again on Sunday... 

On Friday we had their Drunken Shrimp appetizer that was VERY disappointing, it included six Sysco mid-sized shrimp, nothing special.  (food review (D)   Then we tried to enjoy the small steamed artichoke which was uncut and meatless. (food review (C-)   JUST our opinions :-)   

Then on Sunday, since there are several  televisions lining the bar and the staff was wearing football jerseys I assumed that this was going to be a place to enjoy the championship football game.  

I was wrong, I got there around noon to watch the Bronco game, surprisingly only three other people was there watching the game and the blonde bartender was locked up with talking to her \"mahn cheese\" sitting at bar ...  (Service review (D) 
 
After ordering a beer I asked the bartender to turn up the volume of the championship game...  she told me the \"Owner\" would not permit that, that she was only permitted to do so if the Cardinals was playing.  I left after one beer leaving the others comatose with boredom. (atmosphere review (D)

Overall it is my opinion that this place is lacking a theme..  offering its customers a generic lackluster twang to it. You will find the food to be over price because of the neighborhood but there is no value to it. (Menu review (D)    Why does this matter? because this is Scottsdale, were restaurants  come and go ever month and this place has no staying power. :-)  

Overall I would suggest any NEW investors stay away since this place is no way staying afloat by its self. With that said IT IS MY prediction that this place will go the way of Union Brewery and Squid Ink restaurant without receiving a new influx of income from the investors once the lease is up. But that's just my opinions and I include that in case your feel the need to buy a gift card. 

I'm sorry about my one thumb texting of this review off my phone because I had to relocate to  Scottsdale Brewery to watch the game which was packed with happy cheerful customers and good food for the price.      

But please these are just my knee jerk opinions, I'm not bitter nor angered in anyway just disappointed because I had high hopes for this place.. Now I just want to warn others of my experience and hope for improvements. 

Note to my Dearest Lexie,  I would suggest not to banter with the customers and since you've open the door on this subject, stop wasting your family money feeding this Red Dragon of a restaurant and let this place to die.

{"text":"Black and Blue helped me host the most wonderful Rehearsal Dinner for my son and his fiance. We had over 50 people attend. The staff helped set up the room. The room couldnt have been prettier. The staff was awesome. I worked with Scott who was patient and caring. He really held my hand through the whole planning journey!  The food was delicious! Service was excellent! If I could,  I would give them 10 stars!!!
Thank you Black and Blue! Thank you Scott. Cant wait to book another party with you! Your support will never be forgotten!!!"}
{"text":"Four of us went on a Saturday night. The service was so poor we will not return. The server took 10 minutes to arrive and never gave his name all night. Our appetizer was MIA so we asked a roaming manger named Dave for help and although the appetizer showed up Dave was not very concerned. The food was average when combined with really bad service we will go else where next time."}
{"text":"I wasn't concerned about the price of my burger and fries at $13, but expected good quality. The burger was over cooked and dry. The fries were not warm and very greasy. We danced and burped up all night. It was the second time it happened to us, eating the same meal. Therefore, it doesn't seem likely that we will be returning for more indigestion. The entertainment has seem to gone down hill, which is what originally got us there. There is much better dance music elsewhere. Think twice about what's out there for entertainment.    Jo Ann"}
{"text":"It was our 1st time dining at B&B and we really enjoyed it. The food is great & the server,  Ally was terrific!  She was so personable as was the manager & owner. They spent time chatting which made it feel like we were regulars. The prime rib was something special. It is cold smoked for hours before final cooking which makes it super tender. We plan to visit again soon & often."}
{"text":"I liked it.

This is a new place in a physically difficult structure---too much space. You could have 100 people in it and it will look empty. That is the one turn-off to this location, and I think that is what has really hurt it's predecessors (South Beach, Renegade).

We visited with friends last night and the food and service hit a huge home run!! 

We did the drinks and appetizer route. Yes, drinks are a bit too expensive. But, the food is off the charts. Lamb chops were meaty and perfectly cooked on a home made cole slaw that we all ate and then our friend wanted to lick the plate.

The spinach artichoke dip with toasted french roll bread was full of real artichoke and real spinach. The baked clams were to die for. The beef sliders did not last long--we devoured them whole. Finally, the charcouterie plate had some extraordinary cheeses and meats (we couldn't finish it) and then we called off the charge into grazing because we were pleasantly stuffed.

I think the food prices and quality are exceptional. The service (Luke) was top-notch. The location is excellent (not very far from my home).

I would not think of this as a steakhouse, I would say more of a high-end foodie joint. It seems that if they can find some way to overcome that sort of \"empty\" feeling due to such a large amount of floor space, they will knock it out of the park.

I definitely recommend giving this new place a try. I know we will be there again very soon."}
{"text":"We had a birthday lunch at Black and Bleu grill today.  Our waiter, Brandon was so pleasant and helpful.  Our lunches were delicious....I think we've found a \"go to\" place when we're craving a burger.  My husband had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was delicious as well.  We loved the restaurant setting....so glad we have a great place to go near our home.  We'll be back often to try other menu options!"}
{"text":"Its no wonder this place closed.  The douche bags who i worked with that owned it, wouldnt pay their bills.  No, I am not a disgruntled employee, I was a supplier.  If you have to work with or for these a-holes, beware.  You will get stiffed one way or another."}
{"text":"Great service, good background music. Having a burger and it's great. Lots of TV's with variety of sports. Quiet enough to speak but music is loud enough to hear. Great Happy Hour and fun staff."}
{"text":"This place was great! Excellent atmosphere very cool decor and bar area. Wait staff was attentive and very polite. Food was quite delicious and had us in and out fairly quick.(We stopped over for lunch so had limited time) Overall I have no complaints a great addition to North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try this neighborhood gem after reading other reviews.  We are glad we took a chance - the service we received from Kristen was great and the food was very good.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place!
Great food, great atmosphere (the patio is beautiful), very sweet staff, good music. I had good service and the food I chose was outstanding. I'll absolutely be going back. Eating at this place was exactly what i needed after a long work week. The calamari was prepared very differently than I had ever seen but it was yummy and I appreciated the uniqueness. Caesar salad was good, the artichoke dip was VERY good and the shrimp scampi was to die for.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Feeling pretty bummed tonight. Came in with friends and family to find that they completely changed the menu again. Our house favorites are gone, average entree price went up about $10. We grabbed some drinks and got great service, but went somewhere else for food. This is probably our last visit here."}
{"text":"Went there again and this time sat in the bar. Love it! Me and a friend had salads that were excellent. Really good! The service was very friendly and prompt. This place is really on track! I can really recommend them!"}
{"text":"Business dinner was disappointing. Steak was cooked perfect if you like cold steak ........served warm to cold. Flavor was good but was not hot like my favorite steak house serves. Menu is busy, hard to read and they need to focus on what they do well which is undetermined at this point. No fancy bread before, during our meal. Priced high for the product, location and service. Mixologist makes a good and different selection of drinks. I would return for the drinks. Staff needs training how to serve. I had to fight to keep my salad plate as staff kept trying to take it without asking. I would return for the pumpkin desert and cheesecake desert. Maybe they should be a drinks and desert restaurant? Love the other restaurants run by this owner so what happened here?"}
{"text":"First visit was during the 'soft' opening, loved the small portions & alternative menu. Disappointed to learn it was now an American Sports grill. Stayed away until tonight when we tried it again on the strength of a $20 voucher.
Really good evening, menu uninspiring but what we ordered was good - Ahi  Tuna Sliders, short ribs & shared a cheesecake for desert. Good value including 2 drinks. Will definitely go back if only to get a drink at the bar. Shame the menu has conformed to the boring sports bar stereotype & they didn't stick with the original concept!"}
{"text":"OK, this place has only been open a week. However, if it wants to be known as a \"steakhouse,\" it will be competing with Mastro's, Fleming's, Grill 44 and Ruth's Chris among others. Measured alongside these restaurants, Black & Bleu's management has a lot of work to do.

The menu is a little bit of this and that. It creates the impression that this eatery has an identity crisis. Most steakhouses will bring out a basket of warm bread or rolls. At Black & Bleu, we had to ask for bread THREE times. In the end, we were brought two slices of toasted white sandwich bread more suitable for toast points than anything else -- and with NO butter. All this in a \"steakhouse\" charging $44 for a 14 oz ribeye and $42 for lamb chops.

The wine list is relatively small and mediocre, There are a number of cabernets and pinot noirs but only one merlot. On the bright side, the barmaids are easy on the eyes and the broiler station knows their stuff. Our flatiron steak and NY Strip came out exactly as we ordered. That said, the Lobster Bisque was scorched and the grilled asparagus was limp. In the restaurant world, it's inexcusable to serve your patrons burned soup.

Service was needlessly slow. The waitstaff does not know the menu. Example: they constantly referred to \"crabcakes\" when, in fact, the dish was a single crabcake. The entire waitstaff needs to be trained in the basics. Yes, Virginia, diners should be served from the left and plates removed from the right. The waitstaff has yet to master this basic tenet of service. See: www.chefalbrich.com/etiquette/ 

In sum, the menu needs to be rethought and the staff trained in proper service. Until that time, competing as a \"steakhouse\" in a market that has so many first-class steakhouses will doom Black & Bleu."}
{"text":"Just left there after dinner, and I am super impressed. Our waiter was Jarric (sp) and he was extremely friendly and a wonderful server. 

We started with the filet bites, they were perfectly seasoned, and prepared. The two sauces that came with accompanied it perfectly.

My mother in law ordered the pork chop, and was silent until it was devoured. She said it was fantastic. My 9 year old ordered the Jambalaya, and was warned it was quite spicy. He maned up and are quite a bit of it. I had a few bites and it was a very strong cayenne flavor. I'm not too knowledgeable on the dish, so I don't want to really rate that dish.

Husband ordered the Black and Bleu salad, and I loved it! It was fantastic! He raved about the dressing. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST! I ordered the shrimp and grits..so yummy! It is one of my favorite dishes, and it didn't disappoint.

My little one (15 months) was spoiled! They brought him a BEAUTIFUL dish of fresh fruit! I was jealous! Amazing staff, food and atmosphere! 

Mother in law said it will be in her rotation from now on."}
{"text":"My wife booked a reservation for Valentine's Day on the Yelp app, we had a reservation for 7:00 pm. When we arrived the place was half empty. They said we didn't have a reservation, even after we showed them our confirmation they still didn't apologized they just looked at their iPad. I asked them to seat us because the place was half empty they just stared at their iPad. 

I left because they were so bad at showing any remorse or customer service. I wasn't going to spend 100 dollars there. Think twice about reservations especially on a busy night, I doubt they will be honored.

Also my wife posted a review and the owner harassed her. Horrible management."}
{"text":"We love the place, our Server Josh was very attentive! I had the Bleu Burger with the Caesar Salad. . Excellent, could use more Bleu cheese. . we  live in the neighborhood, it is a great addition to our regulars, Ling and Louies and Stone and Vine!! Will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Live nearby and tried them for happy hour and was very pleasantly surprised. We had heard mixed reviews before so weren't too sure. Anyway we all liked the items we ordered, especially the beef brisket sliders!  Our server, Erica, was great and took time to explain the menu. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the north Scottsdale restaurant options. The food was great. We got the charcuterie, French Dip, salmon, and the kale salad. Each dish was excellent.

Cody was our server, and was one of the most fun servers we have ever had. We will definitely be returning, and bringing others along with us. A++"}
{"text":"This review is all based upon the service... The food itself was not bad. Other than my chicken which was cold on the inside. We had to get the menus for ourselves, we eventually got to order about 20min after. The food took over 1 hour to get to us during lunch time. The place was not busy, the server took forever to even check on our table. Just very disappointing service, I would've said something about the cold chicken, but I was scared how long it would take to heat back up."}
{"text":"Just ok

Cheesy bread & garlic bread were DRY!
Mussels & shrimp were fresh??
Service was ok. 

No wow, not terrible, will try again, but not hopeful it will stay open.

Bar and patio are very nice! Live music is great."}
{"text":"My old review was removed for lack of content. Here is my second attempt with more detail: 

We ordered a few appetizers. The ahi crudo was tasteless and needed salt. I got an overwhelming taste of sesame oil. The artichoke was overcooked to the point where the heart was mush and the lemon mousse tasted like miracle whip and synthetic ingredients. The filet bites were inedible--not quality meat and tasted like it was cooked in coconut oil. The calamari was cold and mushy. It was as if they fried it then nuked it in the microwave due to sitting too long. The Barrata was the only semi enjoyable appetizer. Granted, Barrata is hard to mess up, and most of the ingredients on the plate a monkey could put together. We opted out of ordering dinner and left. All four restaurants in the plaza are bad. Hopefully there will be some improvement soon to the quality of food."}
{"text":"So happy Lisa our server recommended the double breasted pork chop. Amazing! Moist and the glaze was good enough to lick the plate. Seriously -have not had a better chop in years. A definite must."}
{"text":"Yet another update for Black and Bleu....we finally did return to give it a second try. We didn't say who we were when we went in, and the service was excellent.( see previous review) By the end of the evening, the lovely manager Emma came over and made us feel very welcome and she was very gracious. We split a few appetizers and they were all good, as was the wine that we sipped along with them.
Thank you Black and Bleu, and glad we returned to give you another try!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this local restaurant twice. Carefully read all the reviews and we were a little cautious about trying Black and Bleu but glad we did. Our party of four tried both soups and declared them excellent. The sea bass was tender and flavorful, the steak bites melted in your mouth. My husband had the short ribs and loved them and the other gentleman in our group enjoyed the blackened pork chop. The restaurant agreeably swapped out vegetable offerings and made sure our water and iced tea were always filled. Definitely recommend this restaurant and suggest those who had a poor experience; give it a second try."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant again after six visits 2 being ok ,, waited 6 months to re visit seriously shocked they were still
In business & hopeful things changed.. Only to find not so .. Seriously if we had not had happy hour prices \" which we had not had previously in past visits \" this was by far the worst overall food experience thankfully I didn't rape us cost wise we left $50 out the door for 2 people , one glass of wine ,two appetizers and one dessert..and to top it off the bathroom stunk like nasty sewage seriously the worst smell I've ever smelled ever.:"}
{"text":"Had a great visit to Stone & Vine's sister restaurant today. The weather was perfect for patio seating and I was able to bring my dog which is a huge perk! There's a great lunch menu with a lot of different items. 
I got the fish & chips... A nice option was to substitute the side, I still chose to go with the old standard. The portions were a nice size for lunch. The cod was cooked perfectly. They did a remix on traditional tartar sauce which was interesting! 
The service was great. I was greeted promptly by my bartender Lisa and things were on point for the rest of the visit. My drink was kept full and she even brought out a water bowl for my pup. 
The atmosphere inside is one of the better I've seen. I love all the amazing lighting fixtures and they spared no details. 
I will definitely be back again soon, perhaps to try out the dinner menu. 
Oh and I would give five stars but Yelp hates that for some reason."}
{"text":"We put our experience in our server's (Michael) hands and pretty much let him order for us. His recommendations were great!  Fillet bite starters were amazing. Burgers were a cut above what you'd expect and I think I'd walk a mile over broken glass to have another skillet cookie!  Michael made the experience truly enjoyable. We will be back."}
{"text":"Our experience could have been better. We hadn't been here since the ownership and name changed. seemed a good idea to check it out. Our waiter was running the entire meal. I don't know if the place is understaffed or if someone didn't show up. Drinks were forgotten and food delayed. We still tipped him 20% since he was working hard. My wife liked her burger but her sweet potato fries (that cost an extra dollar) were not good. Her cheesecake dessert was good. I am not sure the burger was worth $13.  My salad was ok but at $15 a high price for a few pieces of steak, one of which was gristle, plus greens and onion. The person doing salad prep forgot the dressing which didn't help. There were some interesting beers. Our friends liked their food. After counting my beers plus two cheesecake, lunch for  fourwas $103. Before beer it would have been over $20 per person, including dessert  for two of four which seems a lot. We may try this again but not soon.  There is obviously a following."}
{"text":"Our first time and definitely will return ... Excellent service by Ally ... And acoustic music was excellent ... Our entrees, party of 6, were all excellent... And bread pudding was amazing !!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant.  Really good Happy Hour!   Brandon is a great server!  Liked the filet bites, burgers and salads.  Very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and not crowded considering the busy restaurant scene in Scottsdale... Went in with moderate expectations which were achieved if not slightly exceeded. The filet mignon appetizer bites were absolutely delicious. Pretzel cheese fondue- also good. For an entrée - the grilled salmon with roasted vegetables was seasoned quite well and cooked to perfection. Our table also ordered cheeseburgers which they thought were OK. Nice happy hour on cocktails and drinks. Friendly and attentive staff. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Won't go back.   Ate in the \"dining room\" because the patio was booked ( note....tables were empty the entire time we were there).  Dining room was just an extension of the bar...music was loud and made difficult to chat around a booth seating arrangement.  
Food was meh.  First burger was over done and poor. Shrimp caeser salad was ok...however several of the shrimp were still grey in color and not cooked.  Replaced burger with French Dip.   Better..but kept having to ask for the dipping sauce they forgot.  
There is a reason why this place was half empty..and the rest of the strip malls restaurants were packed.  Lesson learned.  
Will not be surprised if a \"for lease\" sign goes up soon.  

Listen folks...simple lessons...good food...differentiate your seating based on areas, and when you have to keep apologizing...send the manager over to actually do something about it.  No one is going to speak up when someone glances by and says \" everyone ok\"?  
Will not be going back...."}
{"text":"Wow!  Chef nailed the shortrib!!! My hubby is an Exec Chef and he luved it.  affordable, nice portions, good service.  I had muscles....GONE YUMMY.  Worth the visit"}
{"text":"I dinned at Black and Bleu last week and I can honestly say it was the best burger I have ever eaten. The service was quick and friendly. The order was brought to use exactly as asked for and cooked to perfection. My entire party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and we agreed it was not only the most delicious food we had enjoyed in a long time, but the service and price were amazing We cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, decided to have a drink in the bar and when we asked the host about sitting in the bar she told us we can order drinks but no food? Awkward but funny. Still went into the bar for a drink and we were given menus (YIPEE, we get to eat!) Ordered spinach dip, crab cakes, ahi tuna sliders and one or two other items off the appetizer section.) Food was great but the portions were SO TINY (like super tiny) for the prices charged. Really disappointed in the size, left hungry. The martinis were really good. Would I come back? Yes but I would just order a meal instead of the appetizers. I would say give it a try as the food is good. Only suggestion I have is the music in the bar was SUPER loud."}
{"text":"Went for the second time again this week and shared the hummus appetizer and my husband and I each had the Ahi Wrap. Both were delicious. I had been in earlier this week and a friend had the Ahi wrap and said how great it was, so we had to go back and try it. Our new favorite. In a spinach tortilla, great seasonings, lots of ahi. Getting hungry just thinking of it! Service as always was wonderful."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago and had a very good meal so we decided to try it again. This time something simple like a couple of burgers and beers and the food really hit the spot. We enjoyed the friendly service from Alec. We definitely will be back, it's great to have this place so close to home."}
{"text":"Great steaks, burgers, local craft brew selection, and custom martinis! 

My family and I celebrated the purchase our new home here with steaks for me and wife and a burger for my son. 

I ordered the Filet and my wife ordered the Ribeye. Both were amazing! Great seasoning and wonderful flavors. My steak was under done - I ordered it Med-Rare but the steak was cooked rare.

The desert was comped because of our celebration. 

Overall, a great restaurant and recommended for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we had the chicken wrap, The Santa Fe cheeseburger and the chicken sandwich which were all equally delicious. Mike our server was very attentive and cordial. Their lunch menu on the weekends is really great as they have nine item for nine dollars with a lot of great selections to choose from and then another mini lunch menu that also was quite diversified.   Are no shortage of options and just really great atmosphere and food"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and decided to give Black & Bleu a try. The service was excellent and the food superb. My Mom was with and we were both extremely impressed. I would recommend this location top both locals and visitors in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. We had a resie and sat on the patio. The atmosphere is so warm, creative decor, lovely textures. We had HH pretzels and crab cakes...amazing. Ahi salad and the rib eye for dinner. Both exceptional. Salad dressing was overlooked but they brought some. Mike was generous and spot on helping us with our service as it appeared our server was in training and just sort of gave up on our table during service. We then had another server jump in who was great as well. Just made for confusing table timing all around. We will be back for sure next time we come to Scottsdale. Nice final evening in the sun."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and was extremely disappointed. We ordered the hummus for an appetizer and it was only mediocre. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it just wasn't quite as well throughout out as it should have been. The roll was too thick so it overpowered the other ingredients. Additionally it was missing something...needs avocado and/or bacon. My date ordered the mac-and-cheese with chicken and it was dry with little chicken; she was extremely disappointed. I had at least hopped for some good craft beer but nothing outside of the more mainstream \"craft\" brews. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Four of us had a lovely meal including the bbq brisket special and the filet bites.  We were very impressed!  We drank a lovely red blend from the small wine suggestions.  It was perfect.  Our server was Ally who was wonderful and knowledgeable. When we asked about the grape varieties in our red blend she googled it for us and reported back.  Above and beyond!  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at B&B, the food was good and the people were friendly.   The only complaint we have is that the restaurant has a sewage smell that lingers.  They need to have a plumber come and fix it.   It really destroys the whole experience."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I've been here a handful of times and the food is great. Try the Ale house burger. Seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had. The Cobb salad is also delicious if looking for something lighter. My man loves the French dip. There is always a place to sit at the bar which is our favorite place to be. Live music on Wednesdays is superb. Service is fast and bartenders are friendly (Danny and mike!). I just can't say enough good things about this place! Just come already, but don't take my seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!! I have been to strip clubs that had better food. No bread. Expensive meals. I ordered \"ahi sliders\" and they were gross; the fish was white and the bread was cold. I sent it back after the first bite. Everyone else I went with said their meal was terrible and cooked the wrong way. My friends ordered fish and steak and it comes with a small side salad on a salad plate, but nothing else on the plate with the meat...just a small steak/fish on a big ol' plate. The service was terrible as well."}
{"text":"Great martinis on happy hour!! Great atmosphere and food. I got the filet tips which are a type of appetizer. Bartender was friendly and great area in general."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere. Fantastic ambiance and can watch sports, listen to nice music and have wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Ok...very negative in the beginning but happy to report a major turn around...good for them, great service and food! YES!!!!!"}
{"text":"had such high hopes as we really enjoy their surrounding restaurants in the same plaza.  Liked the decor, so we sat down to our booth when the waiting began.  Finally ordered cocktails, we like rocks, there was more ice in the glass than booze and then they were $9.50 each, basically a shots worth.  Ordered the sea bass, must not have been Chilean, paid $26 bucks for over cooked fish and you only get one side included which we ordered the asparagus which was burnt on the grill.  Come on $26 bucks for a palm sized piece of fish???  I wanted to really support this place but we will not be going back.  I'll stick to Stone and Vine....."}
{"text":"The food, decor and staff here is amazing! It really has the presence of an upscale classy restaurant with a local touch. The food and drinks are locally sourced and the quality is better than what you would expect for the price range. The owners, Lexie and Matt, are really genuine people who listen to your feedback and go out of their way so you have a pleasant experience. Try the Upscale Burger, you cant get anything like this anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Our server Slooty killed it! Great experience. Appreciate her keeping it real."}
{"text":"I was in the first week they were open and had a great experience. It was great to see a mid-priced steakhouse in the area. The prices are definitely easier on the wallet than Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, etc. The food was very good, and was a portion large enough to split (we had the Ribeye, which included sides). I really like the decor as well - very tasteful and clean. I'm going back tonight!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to take this opportunity to recommend Black & Bleu American Grill.  Zach, Server, always provides first class service and the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"Happy hour 3-7. This place has finally picked up steam and figured it out. Food and service very good. Seems like there is two crowds...happy hour crowd and later night parties crowd. Good tunes. Lots of space in bar and restaurant. Great huge outdoor dog friendly patio but not till it's cooler out. If no parking in front, plenty of parking around back. Good neighbors hangout to meet, eat, drink, party!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service- Ally made our night. We will be back next time we visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on October 24, 2014.  We were very impressed!  We had the Kale Caesar and also the Spinach Salad.  Both of them had very fresh ingredients, the dressing was perfect and the presentation was nice.  We had the Lamb Chops (they were only $24.00, not $42.00 as stated by a previous reviewer) and they were cooked perfect in a Coconut Curry sauce.  We found ourselves saying \"mmmmm\" many times as we were eating.  We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon which was adequately priced.
We have been talking about this food since we went and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Well, we live in the area and looking forward to the re-opening of this restaurant after our daughter and son-in-law said it was good but very expensive.
Went tonight and the food was good - not great happy hour prices. My husband will only drink Beefeater Martinis. The drink was excellent but was $13! Lower shelf gin and straight up with no vermouth is $13. We can get it cheaper at upscale restaurants like the Sanctuary!
The service was spotty. We had to engage 2 different bartenders for service. 
They are portraying themselves as an upscale restaurant yet the surrounding restaurants in same shopping center have much better service.
Wouldn't rush back"}
{"text":"Loved the decor and atmosphere, the server Lisa was sweet and friendly and appetizers were great, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Our first and last time here.  Invited two friends, as well.  Eight appetizers:  all inedible.  The chef must be practicing cooking.  Beef bites tasted like liver; chicken so over done it couldn't be cut with a knife; crab cakes with so much filler you'd have to guess what it was.  Dropped a rib on the floor; told two waiters not to trip on it.  They acknowledged with \"thank you\" but never picked it up.  Told the server that I am allergic to dairy.  Found out she didn't know that cheese was a dairy product. And paid dearly for this experience even at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This place has a high end curb appeal with low grade dog food inside!  It's a glorified sports bar with food to match. If I want to watch football and eat a hamburger I'll go back. This food was awful. Trout is not fresh, it's frozen and terrible. Steak has zero flavor. We spent over $100 and it was garbage. Bar is loud, don't go if you are trying to romance someone, won't work. I was there 4 months ago and walked out, someone said give them another try they've really improved, bull. DON\"T GO!!!  This owner has Stone and Vine and is great, What happened here, this place isn't close to being good. They need to decide if they're a sports bar which the area doesn't need or they are a great steak house which is needed. Listen up owner, pay attention to these reviews as they are spot on. Close off the bar and cut the noise as it's like eating in a gymnasium, try table cloths to soften the feel, give people clean forks after they eat their salad, you're better then this and the people in the area deserve better!  Your prices are stupid high for that crap, peole don't mind paying a high price for quality so serve quality and charge like you are or just cut prices and serve that crap and go out of business. Going like you are you'll be closed before long."}
{"text":"Still not sure why I've been here 3 times. Guess I thought things might change for the better. Food is still horrible. Service has gotten slightly better however. 3rd times a charm, won't be back."}
{"text":"Problem solved! Update...I spoke with the manager Scott and got the answers I needed regarding my overcharged bill. Scott was very professional and rectified the problem immediately.  I'm very happy with this outcome.
Thank you Scott for your professionalism.
Kris"}
{"text":"I like this place. Pleasant staff, good food. Nice surroundings. The one time we had a screw up (long delay on meal) manager came to our table before we even complained and gave us a complimentary dessert and $20 giftcard. Since then have had good experiences.

Only complaints is that I think the prices are a tad higher than I'd expect, and music inside always seems to be on the loud side. Overall, though, an enjoyable place."}
{"text":"Service with Michael was perfect.  My husband had the ale burger which had great flavor and the fries were excellent.  I had the brisket sliders which were good but not great.  The sliders need more sauce or at.least a side of the sauce so you can add more if need be.  The atmosphere is fantastic and this place has happy hour daily from 11-6 and close to home!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night. First restaurant in a long time (for us) that knows how to cook a rare steak. Service was great even though it was \"training\" night. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the decor... BLEU me away from the minute we walked inside for lunch. Somebody put some thought, creativity and cash into the design of this place... modern AND classic, stylish and hip. Our server was sweet and attentive and always made sure we had everything we needed but was never hovering. (I hate hovering). I had the black house salad  (the server said they recently changed it) & it was amazing. Big portions of grilled steak with asparagus, tomato, onion on greens with bleu cheeses crumbles. It was big and delicious. My \"date\" had the Black and Bleu burger which was similar in many ways to my salad and she loved it. Couldn't eat it all in one sitting but was happy to take a 1/4 back home for a snack later. From start to finish this place is a new fave! We'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"My family and I booked a reservation for Easter brunch $50 per person and the set up was comparable to a continental breakfast at your local motel. What a disgrace! Tiny pastries, chopped up fruit, and soggy waffles. Really?! The omelet station was backed up so they offered to take orders and prepare them in the back so we didn't have to wait in line... Oh how nice! No, not really. The first omelet received wasn't even what we ordered. They said they would remake it which took over 20 minutes to come out and the vegetables weren't cooked and the eggs were overcooked. You could tell everyone was disappointed. There wasn't even dessert until some other parties complained and so they through out some last minute mini cakes. The highlight was the mimosas served in plastic flutes that probably came from party city.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: Spoke with the owner Lexie - She was very apologetic for the service we experienced. Unfortunately there were things that happened that day that were completely out of the Staff's control and they did the best they could with what they had. She was more than willing to work with us to make up for what had happened and we came to a great agreement. Considering the majority of reviews they have are above average, we would be willing to give them a second shot."}
{"text":"CLOSED.  went there today for lunch, was told rent went unpaid and staff was told Friday that Sat. was the last day open."}
{"text":"Overall, I wasn't very impressed with Black & Blue. I went for lunch recently with three co-workers. When we arrived, the place was empty except for one couple sitting outside. Since it was a nice day, we decided to sit outside as well. Our waiter seemed nice enough, bringing us water and taking our drink order. As for entrees, three of us ordered three different burgers and one co-worker ordered pasta. Since the place was dead, I thought our food would arrive quickly... but it didn't. While we waited, the couple next to us sent their food back and complained about their drinks (cocktails at lunch). The waiter apologized and offered a redo but the couple just grumbled instead. Nothing was really resolved, but it left me a little uncomfortable as the couple kept grumbling the rest of lunch while the waiter tried to make up for it. 

Eventually, our plates arrived. Everyone ordered their burgers medium rare and all were served medium to well. My burger, the Ale House Burger, had caramelized onions, bacon jam, fontina cheese, and garlic aioli. In theory, it sounded delicious. However the bacon jam was awful. I did not enjoy my burger. My two co-workers ordered the All American and the Hatch Chili. The All American was standard - cheddar with bacon. Nothing special. I was told the Hatch Chili was good but overcooked. As for the pasta dish, the Southwest Alfredo Pasta, my coworker thought it was good. It looked pretty appetizing and a rather large portion for lunch. 

We asked the check be split into two upfront, but when the check came, the waiter was slightly confused. It was probably because he was so focused on trying to make the other couple happy that he forgot about us. Thus, we waited around for another 10 minutes while he figured it out. We finally paid and were on our way. Overall, I was not impressed with my burger and the entire atmosphere/vibe was just off. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a large reception.  Service was very good throughout the evening, friendly and attentive. 

We had a large buffet with heavy appetizers and most were ok. Refills for the buffet did not come out very fast and did not stay warm for very long. 

I think the place is worth a try for couples or a family but not sure I would recommend it for a large party."}
{"text":"After seeing the response from Lexie for our Mediocre meal on 9/26/15. 

Yes that was our group. When we arrived they were set up for 10 of us and very pleasant about seeing us as a group. As you can see In the second sentence of my review I said we called ahead, talked to management, I explained we were couples and there would be separate checks.and asked if it was OK to all use coupons (I was told if it does not say 1 per table it is fine) and it did not! This was YOUR coupon off YOUR site. I do not think just having that many people in the group should have made the food mediocre? If that is why the food was that way then the entire restaurant must have been getting mediocre food. I do know the table next to us which was 2 couples were complaining about their food too. That is why our waitress was so long talking to the other table with our checks in hand. She was trying pacify them with what they had ordered and saying it was their fault for ordering things cooked the way they did. I also know that she was told we all had the 20% off coupon and that it would be separate checks before we ordered.  She was all smiles and told us it would be fine. Having a group of 10 should not have made our time in the restaurant run so long either. We ordered drinks  the minute we sat down. The food order was put in as soon as the drinks were brought back. The restaurant was almost empty on our side so there were not that many tables. It truly was MEDIOCRE food and poor service regardless of how you try to spin it."}
{"text":"My first-time here today and far from the last.
Attentive server, superb food, and dog-friendly patio just put BB on my rotation. 

Also, kudos to the manager for responding to so many Yelp reviewers.

It frustrates me how Yelpers, particularly those bent on defaming with their doleful attitude and writer's prowess of an eight-year-old, give a restaurant one chance to make good or else look out - the wrath of Khan is upon the eatery.

I'm not sure I could hold back my responses to some of these idiots the way the manager has so artfully done. 
In and of itself, this speaks volumes about B & B.
You've got my vote."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner and had the all American burger and it was fabulous! My server Addysen was amazing and very attentive, she has a very upbeat and bright personality. She made my experience awesome and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice experience at Black and Bleu. Our waiter was friendly and personable. Our food was good quality.  I had the lamb chops which were very well prepared and my husband said his steak was excellent. We really enjoyed the ambiance in the main dining room, which I would describe as urban cowboy without loosing the level of sophistication one would hope for while going out for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Great night out to celebrate my 27th birthday. Food was amazing, the atmosphere was very laid back, but still has a high end feel. The service was fantastic. Drinks stayed full the whole time. Filet bites were the highlight of the meal followed by the cookie skillet desert. Great for groups. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. New chef came from the famous monties steak house in Tempe. Ribeye was great!! The pork chop that Lisa recommended was a perfect 10 also!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the wine awesome, and our waiter Candace was the best!! Highly recommend this restaurant.. Come in and request Candace"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great.  Went there for the variety on the menu since there were 8 of us.  I must say I was very surprised with I got there because the place has a bowling ally feel complete with laminated menus.
Our waiter Derek was a hoot. Great service, supper funny and helped us order his favorites which were on point.  Food was yummy although the portions were a bit large and presentation on plating needed work. 
We were not aware on Saturday nights it turns into a geriatric singles club but, we had a ball.  The live music was great and we had a ball dancing."}
{"text":"We were headed to Stone & Vine and saw Black & Bleu.  We decided to give it a chance.  I ordered the Green Chili Burger cooked medium.  My wife order the Caesar Salad and a grill cheese for the kid.  The burger came out with the patty and green chili but nothing else.  I asked for lettuce and tomato.  My first bite was not great.  I notice the cook burnt the burger and tried to cover it with cheese.  With the toddler ready to roll, it's hard to send back.  The pretzel bites and IPA were good.  Unlikely to return for dinner but would get a beer there."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant. A steakhouse in this area is desperately needed. Advertised as a moderately priced upscale steakhouse, this restaurant is instead desperately in need of a concept/identity. We visited this restaurant at 7:45 on Saturday. The restaurant was almost most empty. RED FLAG, especially since the owner's other restaurants in the same plaza (which we love!) were crazy busy. The restaurant decor is gorgeous but it definitely does not have the more intimate, classy \"steakhouse\" atmosphere we were hoping for/anticipated. Instead, it felt much more like an overly decorated sports bar complete with flat screens, football games and loud music which seemed to echo across the expanse of space. Upon arrival, the hostess tried (unsuccessfully) to seat us at a high top table in the bar. I guess she just assumed we were there just for drinks?? After being seated in the overly large open dining room, I asked to see a specialty drink menu. They don't have one. \"The drink menu is still being worked on\". Big miss as liquor is where a restaurant makes its profits.Interestingly, there were only a couple people seated at the bar. The menu was also a surprise as it seemed more geared towards appetizers/salads, burgers, and sandwiches than steaks or other grilled dinner entrees. There were a few high priced steaks/grilled meats on the menu but they appeared as an afterthought. Seeing this, we decided that this restaurant was more of a \"bar\" than a place where we should consider dropping $33 for a filet dinner.So,very disappointed, we opted to go with the steak sandwich which ended up taking very long to come out of the kitchen despite the lack of guests. The sandwich was bland and disappointing. No taste, at all. Where is the seasoning or the \"special sauce\" to bring attention to your kitchen? I could have (and should have) made this sandwich at home as it was just a thin grilled piece of meat with a slab of cheese melted on it along with the normal LTM combo on an overly large, dry roll. The steak sandwich at Jersey Mike's is far better tasting than this sandwich for less $$. My husband ordered a side of \"corn off the cob\" and it had a vinegar taste??? As a side note-While waiting for our meal to arrive, another table was seated. While they ordered immediately, they appeared very agitated as they waited approx 45 min for their food to arrive. Our check for two drinks, soup, and two steak sandwiches came in at a hefty $74. So much for \"moderately priced\". To survive, Black & Blue has a lot of work to do. Most important, they need to decide if they want to be a bar or a steakhouse. Then, they need a better menu and a chef who can cook. I don't see this restaurant lasting long as it is operated today."}
{"text":"I am having the BEST experience at Black and Blue on the patio! I seriosly don't get out much, but I will 'venture back here! The food is excellent...and (for me) the exceptional waitstaff Zach and Michael make the experience worth talking about!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of this place after reading the reviews on here but a friend recommended it. I am so glad I went! It seems they have changed even more of the menu since the \"reopening \" and everything was great. The service was exceptional our waiter Nick was one of the best waiters I have ever had.  He really went above and beyond and was just a really nice guy. We started with the crab cakes and mussels, both were delicious, the mussels had a little kick to them which I love and the crab cakes had big chunks of crab meat and was topped with ginger. I had the American burger with a pretzel bun as my entrée  and it was so good I had to force myself to not eat the entire thing. I can not wait to go back and try more of their food! Such a great surprise that the service was awesome (which seems to be lacking lately in Scottsdale) and so was the food."}
{"text":"Came in Wednesday night with the family. There was live music that was enjoyable for everyone. I had the shrimp scampi and it was absolutely delicious! Perfect portion size and amazing taste. Our server was very knowledgable and helpful. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. The service was good, cool atmosphere, AMAZING PRIME RIB. Seriously. I can't stop thinking about it. My girlfriend also loved her salmon, said it was the best she has ever eaten.  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"My husband is visiting a new client in Phoenix so we decided to explore Scottsdale restaurants.  We are so glad we decided to dine at Black & Bleu.  The hostess Natasha was delightful and friendly.  Our server Shannon was truly amazing, always showing up when we needed something.  We even met Brandon the owner.  Now, about the food:  the ribeye was cooked exactly to taste and the vegetable medley was steamed perfectly.  We didn't make it to dessert because we were too full.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here this week. It was DEAD. The bartender said it gets busy at night, but their \"lunch rush\" was one other table. Beautiful ambience with awesome metal curtains that I really want!

My companion and I shared the grilled cheese and fries, and the strawberry fields salad (spinach, strawberries, nuts, goat cheese).  Fresh and tasty  salad but I wouldn't go out of my to come here for it. The grilled cheese was a bit disappointing though. There are two great aspects of a grilled cheese. One is the crunch of when you bite on the crisp top layer of bread, and the other is when you pull the sandwich and have to deal with melting cheese falling down your face. The top of the bread was soft and cheese wasn't \"melty\" enough. So it was a little unsuccessful. The fries reminded me of frozen seasoned supermarket fries. I think they could try harder so 3 stars. 

UPDATE:  I went again today and food was awesome!  We shared the short rib sandwich ( it had macaroni and cheese on it!!!!!!!) and the sausage and peppers sandwich. Both were so good I have to wonder if my last meal there was just an off day?  Based on today's meal, I would give it 5 stars, so I'll average this visit with my last and assign 4 stars."}
{"text":"Very pretty. Nice decor.

DO NOT order the veggie burger!  It is mushy and tastes like canned mushroom soup.

The fries were great. Compliments to the chef.

The steak sandwich was barely edible...I could not chew it (I do have all my teeth). 

Caesar salad was decent. Chef gets a light pat on the back for this dish.

The wine tasted like wine. For $7 I couldn't ask for more. Compliments to whoever poured it.

Water was very moist.

Service was fine."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I work in the same complex and have not eaten here in awhile. After hearing they revamped the menu and hired a new chef I needed to try it out. I ordered one of their spinach wraps during lunch and I cannot say enough great things. I went in with 3 other co workers and everything we had was amazing. I will definitely be back more often. Jimmy is the new chef and he has definitely turned the place around not to mention the decor is very beautiful."}
{"text":"Went here for live music on Wednesdays. The group was great and had a good atmosphere of people. If I could give the food and service more than 5 stars I would. I had the filet bites and they were worth the price! So glad there is a place in my neighborhood where I can enjoy great food, great live music, and great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and great service. Had the Ale House burger and it was absolutely scrumptious...The bartenders are very friendly and helpful and make great mojitos. Wishing Black and Bleu a lot of success!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at my favorite restaurant. Awesome food and customer service.  Derek our waiter was excellent and very helpful in helping the way around the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Our server Paul provided excellent service. The décor of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"First let me tell you I do not work for Black & Bleu and I don't even live in Scottsdale.  My wife and I went to the Black & Bleu on a whim.  We are from Gig Harbor WA and looked for a steakhouse and saw this place when we were cruising by.  My wife is not a big steak/beef person -- she is a take it or leave it sort of person; this comes into play here in a second.  So to appease me she agreed to stop in, assuming she would be ordering some seafood or chicken.  Again to appease me she agreed to order the Filet Bites for our appetizer -- I love this woman.  The bites were amazing.  So amazing my WIFE ordered a SECOND helping (that in itself about blew me away).  Onward, I had the rib-eye steak.  I know it's tough to screw up rib-eye but what I have found in my many years (65) chefs can't seem to get the steak right.  I like a medium-rare steak.  Most chefs make it bleeding rare -- nasty!  I like it red, not bleeding so when you put the fork in it the cow screams -- no no no!.  But the steak at Black & Bleu was PERFECT!!!  Man was that good.  Every bite melted in my mouth.  Plus the blue cheese butter on top is something I want to put on my steaks from now on, as well because it was the perfect condiment.  The chef, Jimmy, is amazing an cooks up a great meal -- this place is not to be missed by locals and alike.

Our waiter, Josh was great.  Did a wonderful job of making sure we had all we needed and made great recommendations.  His timing with us was perfect -- never hovering just there at the right times to make sure all was well.  

The manager, Scott, came by and we let him know how pleased we were and we will ALWAYS make it a stop for us when we are in town.

All in all it was a perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is pretty ordinary.  Not great but not bad.  

As one reviewer noted, the physical structure is really big.  It seems like you are eating in an empty barn - a nicely decorated barn, but still big.

We sat on the patio this latest time.  Very pleasant, although the music was too loud and blaring.  It was distracting rather than adding to the ambiance.  In addition, you could occasionally get smoke for the cigar bar a few doors down.  Also, there was a whiff either of the sewer or maybe excess propane from the fireplace.

The food was okay.  We had appetizers.  The server told us the crab cakes were great, very little filler and lots of crab meat.  Nope.  Just the opposite.  It was filler all the way.

The tuna sliders were excellent, although you have to like ginger and Dijon mustard a lot.  I do, so I thought there were excellent,  But they are heavy on the ginger and Dijon.

We also had the Brussels sprouts.  Again, the server said they were excellent, sautéed with bacon, etc.  Well, there was no bacon in sight, and they could have been cooked a little more and a little more evenly.  

Lastly, we had the tenderloin bits.  They were good, but only when you added one or both of the tasty sauces that came with them.  But they were pretty good.

Overall, there does not seem to be anything special about this place.  Just a run of the mill big box steak house."}
{"text":"Had lunch when it opened. Serves were very personable and made the dining experience even better. Food and cocktails were top notch."}
{"text":"The server was very informative almost to a fault. She basically convinced us to share something instead of having our own meals. It worked out for us because we were not starving. The ahi tuna wrap was amazing! I will definitely be back for that. We had mash potatoes as a side, they were fine but for $7 I would not order them again. The only bad part about our visit was the band. They are supposed to be a blues duo but they were terrible, and I like blues! We left as soon as we finished eating because we couldn't stand the music any longer."}
{"text":"Not the worst meal I've had, but pretty close. I got the Ahi Salad and it was so bland and the fish was low quality. The dressing was gross and ruined the salad.
Service was ok, but they ran out of vodka?! Strange, sense they have a massive bar. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Good quick service for a large party/private room with a party of about 20.  The food options were pretty standard but everything tasted good and was hot.  Minus one star because the wait staff was a bit gray on the bar offerings for specials, drafts, liquor varieties, etc."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife an 5 year old on a Friday at 5:15.   Really wanted to sit on the patio but the three open tables were \"Reserved.\"   Annoyed that these same three tables were still open when we left - the main room was mostly empty at this time. 

Kids menu is good and our son liked the chicken fingers & fries.   We ordered two of the seared ahi tuna salad and requested cooking 'medium'  - but they were quite disappointing.  Server indicated they are about 6oz of tuna.    The salads were simply some greens with an array of very thin sliced pre-cooked tuna that had no flavor at all (bordering on not so fresh). There was nowhere near 6oz worth, either.  The tuna wasn't edible in my book and I'm usually not too picky (pushed it to the side and ate the greens).  The server seemed new and obviously didn't know this dish - he should have told us that this was pre-cooked and from the fridge when we told him how we wanted it cooked.  The manager couldn't comment on it either, but offered to replace the order.   Unfortunately, that wasn't much of an option as our 5yo wouldn't have the patience to start over with waiting for new dishes - I'm sure other parents can relate.    They did bring out a grilled chicken breast for us.   Left hungry and annoyed that we were still charged for one salad - because a lousy meal is still worth 50%?  

Also, it was difficult to read the menu.  I know my eyes aren't as good as they used to be, but all the descriptions were in tiny italic print and many in a light blue font.  

We were here previously about a year ago and enjoyed it then.  They used to a have a grilled mahi mahi sandwich that we liked, but it's no longer served.  I've had the steak salad and burgers in the past which were very good.  However, won't be rushing back - there are so many good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place keeps closing and opening up as a very similar restaurant. But I hope they make it this time. I only had an appetizer and a drink and it was good."}
{"text":"2nd time here & I'll be back! The burgers are divine. The steak salad was tasty but the meat was fatty. Drunken shrimp was delish but we got it without the garlic cheese bread because we eat mostly gluten-free - great flavor but definitely needed the bread or rice to soak up the yummy sauce."}
