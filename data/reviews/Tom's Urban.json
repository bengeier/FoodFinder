{"text":"I came for happy hour and it has been my best experience on the Vegas strip. The food was good but what stood out was the service. The hostess was friendly, the supervisor went around to tables to see if people were happy with their meals but our server, Michael, was the BEST!!!! If you can request for him-DO IT. I've had enough bad restaurant experiences to really appreciate a good one in Vegas. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is a follow up review of Tom's Urban Las Vegas and my second five star rating.  Ate here last September and loved every bite. Decided to eat here again on our next trip in May and brought along another couple who had never been here before.  Made reservations online but were able to get in 45 minutes early.  We were nervous wondering if we would get the same high quality service and food we had the first time. We were not disappointed!  Server and Maggie was attentive, friendly and helpful with menu questions. The potstickers were as good as I remembered-soft, tasty little pockets of goodness with a yummy dipping sauce. I was so excited to eat them I forgot to take a picture so my only photo was of an empty plate. Our friends tried the nachos which they loved and we also tried the brussel sprouts, which were the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  Charred but not bitter, and the sauce was full of flavor but not too spicy or sweet.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the shade and the stripside sights and sounds. We took advantage of the 4:00 happy hour prices so even the overall bill was better than expected. Tom's Urban is definitely on our \"go-to\" list when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ron Chocolate is the best ever. Had the Mule Kick and it was off the chain. Changed the T.V channel to what we wanted to watch and accommodated our every need."}
{"text":"I will comment on the service not the food. We were seated right away at 3pm. The place is nearly empty. We placed our drink orders shortly and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks. We then ordered food and waited over 30 minutes for it to come out. The waitress forgot our napkins. I am writing this review at 3:58pm sitting in their patio with flies, bees, pigeons flying everywhere and deeply regretting spending $50 for an abysmal two person dining experience. Let's see how long I'll have to wait for the requested check to come."}
{"text":"Just ate here. Horribly slow service. Drinks came out 1 at a time! Food delivery was over an hour. Cold food and not all meals were delivered. Unbelievable that we had to pay for this dis-service and subpar food!"}
{"text":"Amazing find with great atmosphere, food and service. A must stop for brunch with extensive cocktail list and beer selection. Ask for Jennifer as your server!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...0 stars!  Tom's Urban was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years!  Ordered a glass of champagne as it was my birthday, took 15 minutes to arrive then wasn't the kind I'd ordered.  Had to literally flag someone down because the staff were so inattentive.  Finally got my champagne.  Ordered food, when it was finally delivered, it wasn't as I'd ordered (I didn't make a bunch of high maintenance substitutions, just chose options from their menu).  The plate looked so completely unappetizing that I did not want the meal corrected, I just said forget it.  I couldn't have eaten what they delivered anyway, there wasn't any flatware on the table other than a knife and oversized soup spoon.  Ugh!  This place sucks, there are far better choices along the strip."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try a meal here because there was an intriguing happy hour concept. During certain hours, the prices of drinks and food would vary, from lowest prices about 4 pm, and higher prices into the evening. We got there about 6 pm, when the price for a selected menu was $6 each item, and the price of a drink was $7. These were supposed to be happy hour, or discounted, prices. The regular price for a draft of domestic beer was $7. I assumed the happy hour price would be less than $7, so I ordered 2 Buds. The price turned out to be $7 each. No discount at all. On the food menu, the regular price for the steak street tacos was $18, The price for the happy hour was $6. That looked like a good deal, so I ordered it. Several minutes later, the server brought out a corn tortilla, about the size of a small bagel. On it was a tiny amount of cheese, and a little spoonful of meat. I asked the waitress if this was the regular price, and she said the regular price of $18 was for three of these minuscule servings.  I pointed out that each would then be $6, which was the happy hour price. In other words, for the happy hour you get one taco for $6, but the regular price was 3 for $18, which is $6. So, the beer and the taco were exactly the same price for the happy hour and the regular menu. Very Deceptive. My advice - before ordering at this restaurant, be very careful. They really offer no happy hour deals. By the way, the taco was OK, but not worth $6. I would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban isn't super impressive inside or anything (think upscale sports bar),  but the food was good (for Vegas pricing).   I had a drink called Gin and Juice (cucumbers, strawberries, gin, and splash of soda). It was honestly probably one of my favorite drinks ever. I had the Thai salmon as my entree. It came with plentiful veggies and a large filet, but the sauce was very spicy. Too spicy for my liking, as it made it not enjoyable to eat. The fish was cooked perfectly however, and it was still a delicious meal.   They serve breakfast all day, and this seemed to probably be the way to go. Apparently they make their own PopTarts!   It was chilly when we went, but the patio looks like a fun place to eat out on. They do have heating lamps, but it was a bit too chilly in November for us to brave it outside.  Overall, this is one of the most memorable meals i had in Vegas. Prices are a bit crazy, but it's Vegas...and unlike most of the restaurants you leave without feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"Didn't know anything about this restaurant but we were looking for s good breakfast and the menu looked good the previous yelp reviews were decent.  Happy to say our meal was delicious and satisfying. I ordered the 3 little pigs omelette and my fiance ordered bacon and eggs.  Service was great and the food was plentiful, piping hot and tasty.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Don't try and use an MGM gift card at this place because they won't take it even though the gift card is supposed to be for dining. I guess you can't call what they serve their food. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great for groups (9 of us), awesome food...we all ordered separate things and every one loved their food. Real winners were the sin city burger, brussel sprouts, and my strawberry margarita. Also, our friend got 50% off his meal this month for having his name start with a T! Wait staff was awesome and the interior is fun to look at! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is the best bar and grill in Las Vegas the hot bar tender with suspenders made a prickly pearl drink that was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Sami F. Helped us navigate the menu and make good choices. Thanks Sami!!"}
{"text":"They closed over half an hour before the posted time. Super disappointed we didn't get to eat here."}
{"text":"Try the shrimp and avocado salad and the lobster roll. Overall, great food, atmosphere, and music. Try sitting on the patio and watch people pass by on the strip. Great spot in the afternoon as the patio is totally shaded and they have great tv's for watching games."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and every employee we encountered was extremely nice and friendly. Our burgers were great and especially the \"big ass egg roll\"!"}
{"text":"Love the decor, open space, bloody marys & cheesy/crunchy hashbrowns. Food was lukewarm -- seems like food was sitting under heat lamps for awhile. Filet mignon breakfast medallions were eh (medium-rare was extra well done) & breakfast burrito was dry. Service was exceptional. Paulina rocks!"}
{"text":"The food was alright but I was not overly impressed with this restaurant.  We came in on a night where there was a fight and also a concert so naturally it was loud and busy. Still, they were able to seat us right away which was great after a day of travel.  Our waiter however was very slow, not very personable, and to be brutally honest, quite clueless.  For the menu... I was extremely disappointed to see that the only plant based options were sides like sweet potato fries and edamame. I think that it is very important for a restaurant to have at least one vegan option for those of us with dairy and meat sensitivities (or for those of us who also just don't want to consume animal products for ethical reasons). I ended up having a pizza. I got the truffle, portobello mushroom, and arugula pizza - it was pretty good but my stomach was most definitely not happy with me afterwards."}
{"text":"Ok so this is not tom from MySpace! This place is amaze balls. The food (philly cheesesteak/ filet sliders) made me forget about my dangerous/ flavorful drinks from Nathan at the bar, which were exceptional! The manager brought us a special drink called Area 51 that had fireball in it and it was soo good! Recommended this place and thank you to my friend spencer for recommending it! ;)!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the NYNY and I was looking for a place that wasn't super crowded and had a bar with lots of options and good food. This place has both! There are so many beers on tap, it's like a dream come true. Every food item we had was an elevated version of itself. We had some fondue and it wasn't just some fondue with nasty ass cheese. No, this fondue was delectable and it left me wanting more. The next time I went there I got the breakfast burrito...and it is more than enough for 2 people! Holy cow! It was also very delicious. Any time I go back to Vegas, this is my go to stop. I absolutely love Tom's Urban. Always had quick service too, and happy servers."}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurants in Las Vegas from the nicest steakhouses to hot dog stands and yet still my dining experiences have always been enjoyable due to the competitive environment of satisfying customers. Went to this place at 10 pm on a Saturday night. Although the place was practically empty, We were seated and we sat there for almost 10 minutes and was not greeted by a waiter or provided water. Several times they made eye contact with my husband and I and not once did they come by to take our order. Never coming back here again and it would be nothing short of a miracle if this place is still there in another few months if they don't fix themselves."}
{"text":"Was just going to have lunch there and check it out. After sitting for 10 mins and no one even taking our drink order we decided to leave. It was not even busy. We got up and walked away from our table and someone eating there even said good choice. I'm not going to pay the prices they have on their menu and not have attentive service. Had heard the food was good which is why we came.....bad service will ruin the business!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner during my best friends Batchelor party trip. It was a very hectic couple days trying to entertain 22 other guys for 3 days/nights. I called Tom Urban's to make a reservation the day of and the manager went out of her way to pull some strings to make everything happen.  The food and location were amazing.  They were only second to to the service and drinks.  From the phone to make the reservation to the second we left, we felt welcome and very well taken care of. Which for a group of regular guys from New Hampshire in Vegas... That's pretty unheard of! Thank you I'll be back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not so good food. American hamburger seemed like the hamburger patty was gotten out of the warming drawer although they commented that it was made fresh to order. Really...then how come the cheese wasn't even melted and the hamburger was lukewarm when served. Texas BBQ sandwich didn't fair as well. Ever had those bbq sandwiched served in your high school lunch? Yup...brought back memories. Better order the liquor after your meal to wash this all down. Why the 2 stars....the salad that came with my bbq sandwich was fresh and the calamari so so...."}
{"text":"The lobster and shrimp mac n cheese was amazing and recommended by our wonderful server, Ivanna! She was super friendly and even made a special non alcoholic drink for me! Great experience and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Asthetically this place is amazing and is easily matched by the cuisine. If you're coming from out of town or you're a regular definitely dive into the shrimp and grits (southern boy stamp of approval) the ribs are nothing short of meat falling off of the bone, and the Brussel Sprouts won't disappoint. All in all awesome evening and the staff was excellent 10/10!"}
{"text":"Where there were at least 8 open tables when arriving, we were told there were 2 parties ahead of us.  When I asked the hostess what about the open tables, she replied \"there aren't as many tables open as it seems\" whatever that means.    After waiting for 15 minutes for an \"open\" table, we were seated in one of the tables that had been empty the whole time.  Note, if you want to have a conversation with the people you are with make sure to sit close, the music is super loud.    We ordered drinks and our food. Drinks came in about 10 minutes, which consisted of a Pepsi and an iced tea.  Our food didn't come out for 45 minutes and when it arrived it was obvious that it had been done for a while and forgotten in back.  Since we were hungry we ate and just wanted to leave.  Mind you the waitress, who I believe was named Ashley, never came around once to refresh our drinks until we were done and wanting the check. Had the food been hot and the music been a little less blaring, would easily give 4 stars.  But was a terrible experience that won't be repeated ever."}
{"text":"Three words : Prime. Rib. Sliders. By far the greatest slider I have every eaten. Literally wishing I had one right now. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch! Lots of beer options on tap and the food portions are large. Highly recommend server Nate. Walked all the way from Mirage and the experience was totally worth the long walk."}
{"text":"Celebrating my birthday week, my family took to Tom Urban, what a wonderful experience, I honestly though it would be another strip restaurant. The service was great and the food was really good!!! We tried a little bit of everything and it was awesome. Our server Miranda what a personality she is awesome, the manager Damielle ( I hope I spell it right, lol that's due to the never ending delicious drinks I kept getting from our bartender ILAN , I might have not correctly written their names down) The manager kept coming over making sure we were having a great time and everything was nice and hot and our drinks nice and cool!!!!!! I totally will be back for another fun night at Tom Urban!!! Thank You staff!!! J"}
{"text":"Server was very nice and gave us advise as to where to go on our vacation. Food was great and the atmosphere was great. Bottomless mimosas... why not, And let's have one to go"}
{"text":"The crispy duck wings are the best.  Also enjoyed the prime rib sliders.   I highly recommend both.  Our server Paul was great!"}
{"text":"Very good meal and great service from Eddie, who repeatedly went the extra mile just because. Joe, his manager, also made a strong impression and was sincerely grateful for my favorable comments about Eddie. Overall excellent experience and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Good tacos, no complaints. Average vegas prices. Decent beer list including a few regional selections. Getting sat took a very long time as hostess seemed to be distracted socializing and needed reminding that we were waiting, after which our table magically \"just opened up.\" Service was very attentive and prompt. Our food came quickly and was cooked & played well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late dinner here tonight and loved the atmosphere. Food was really good with a nice variety ordered by our party. Everybody was very happy with their selection and the sizable portions. Our server, Eddie, was fantastic and took very good care of us. Overall we had a great experience and highly recommend this place.   Thanks Eddie for making us very happy customers!"}
{"text":"Came out for Cinco De Mayo.   Host was great but service at table was horrible.  Cheryl our waitress was horrible. Worst attitude and very dismissive.   Good came out cold. Had the mahi tacos / steak tacos / Brussel sprout and macn cheese. Both sets of tacos came out cold. Not happy especially for what they charge - you get a SINGLE taco for $5 during Beat the clock time. Wow. Ripoff   Ordered drinks and glass came with a very apparent chip in the glass.   We are locals and honestly we will most likely never be back here.  Way too many places on the strip where the   I would stay away."}
{"text":"Took 20 mins after being seated to get a menu. 25 more mins to get a burger - one that was previously frozen and came with greasy fries. All for $25.   Not a good value. Not sure why the 4 star rating. Try another place for burgers..."}
{"text":"Unbelieve eggs benny! All you can drink mimosa's too?!?! What a great spot, got a sick view of the strip from their patio too! Nate was the best server ive had on my trip as well, really personable and just a great guy/server. Must recommend to others. Im new to yelp but this was too good not to throw a bone their way!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas over the past couple days and stopped by toms urban to see what it was like.. Amazing!!! Everything we ordered was great The mahi salad  The polenta and cheese grits!  Lobster and shrimp mac and cheese was the best on the menu. Not too cheesy. Very generous on portions of both meats.  The shrimp po boy sliders went amazing with the side of garlic fries  Toms Urban is great. Wish they had one in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"Our first time staying at New York New York and we had a great time,   We eat @ Tom's Urban twice during our stay.  The food was great and so was the service!  Our waiter recommended the eggs benedict and they were really the best I've ever had,  Next visit to Las Vegas my husband and I will definitely return to Tom's Urban!"}
{"text":"Busy but quickly seated and attended to. Food was excellent! Lemon poppyseed pancakes were delish and not overly sweet. Though we were seated outside under the sun without much shade, the misters were on and our server Kyle was very attentive refilling our drinks to keep us cool.  Kyle was also very personable and offered tips from a local's perspective! Overall great brunch! I would recommend to anyone in town! Next time I'm back, I'll try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Our server Sam was awesome. She made sure we understood the menu and made the perfect recommendations. We will definitely dine at Tom Urban's next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We were on our last night of our trip and ended up at Tom's Urban at the NYNY in Las Vegas.  We had a party of 10 and were tired and hungry.  We ordered the Nachos for appetizers (yummy!!!).  Everyone enjoyed their dinner too. To top it off, Michael, our waiter was wonderful.  He made us laugh and was so easy to talk to.  He gave us good suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed.  Kudos Michael!!!!"}
{"text":"What a Hidden Gem!!! My husband and I were walking down the strip and stumbled upon Tom's Urban and decided to sit down and eat. We were seated by a friendly host at a table on the patio (which is literally connected to the Brooklyn Bridge) and greeted almost immediately by our awesome server Nathan! We tried both of his recommendations and both were equally delicious. I had the filet mignon steak sliders, which had hollandaise sauce on top that really accented the very tender steak. My husband had the sin city burger and said it could easily be the best burger he's ever had. Smothered in BBQ sauce, topped with crispy onions, bacon, and fried egg. His burger came with sweet potato fries, with an amazing chipotle cinnamon rub and some kind of Jamaican jerk ketchup. Definitely not use to finding such great service on the strip with such great food to come with it. We will definitely be back and will be requesting Nathan again!!"}
{"text":"What a waste of space. The \"service\" is abominable, do not use your time in Vegas at this place. Overpriced food attempting to be chic, horrible selection of beers unless you're a metrosexual hipster that pretends to love swill and horse water (a euphemism).   Honestly, I'd be surprised if any of the food isn't prepackaged. It might as well be the cardboard packaging itself, as both my wife's and my food were totally bland and utterly tasteless.  Again, the service... Don't go here unless you enjoy being ignored. And if you do wish to be ignored, why not go across the street to Dick's Last Resort where there is at least comedy entertainment value. Whoever imagined this place was sorely mistaken. Don't be fooled, the menu items appear palatable and creative, they aren't. The service appears friendly and expedient, it isn't. People were dissatisfied in droves.   Eat here if you want to take part in disappearing Vegas history, because this place is about to be demolished for something bigger, better, and grander.  Bleecccchhh!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast. Food was good. Service was okay. Maybe breakfast is not their specialty. Ordered the Denver omelette which was great, but they were out of ham. Bacon was good though. The hash browns were about half cheese and really good!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had and the best server ever. Michael was personable, knowledgable, honest, and perfect.   Enjoy your meal and enjoy your experience with Michael even more!  Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"Pretty good prices for Vegas and outdoor seating offers a nice break from the smokey casinos."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Came in here un planned. Was in Vegas and was looking for a good steak and eggs breakfast, so while walking the strip passed by and seen the menu and their filet mignon and eggs was just what I was looking for. The portions and the food was so good! Will definitely be stopping by when in Vegas. Sit in the patio area enjoy the sprinklers and enjoy the people passing."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the menu. We were told it was good for tapas but they didn't have much. Pricy for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Jennifer rocks!!! She is awesome, very friendly, the best server!! The bottomless mimosas were the bomb!! And the hostesses Corine and Marissa are so nice and sweet, they're the best hostesses!!"}
{"text":"Good flavor, nice drinks, and plenty of sass! This place is new and so, we think there is much room to push it to the limit."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service from our server. Really felt as if she enjoys her job. Will be stopping by on our next trip to Las Vegas. Thanks Carmen for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"We stopped here with friends because they had a comp for a buy one get one free beer. Didn't know what to expect.  The menu was large and had a lot of choices. I was craving a burger so I ordered the Sin City. I have to start by saying this meal was at the end of a long Vegas weekend but it was the best burger I've ever had. The beef was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The rest of the ingredients blended amazingly together. It was my first experience with Tom's but I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food.  This was my second time coming to Tom's Urban - the service was so great this is quickly turning into my go-to place to bring family and friends from out of town.  Location is perfect - spits you out right to the south end of the strip when you're done eating.  This is the 2nd time we had the same server too!  Nate was awesome - super friendly (super tall!!) and made great recommendations, I mean hello!!! Bottomless Mimosas for $18??? Don't mind if I do!  We've been sat indoors and outdoors - both experiences great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for some good food and drinks. I definitely recommend the bottomless mimosas. Paulina was great! Not only is she beautiful, but she is a top notch server. My friend loved the breakfast burrito she recommended. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"#BrunchMunch Maggie walked into my life one morning on a 105 degree Las Vegas day...and everything changed. She was an amazing waitress, and food was delicious. Her manager was a bit lackluster but tried to totally redeem himself by saying corporate is really into Yelp. Is this supposed to help??? Anywho, food, drinks and Maggie were awesome."}
{"text":"Maggie is awesome... The food was good too. I had the Benedict and is Beneficial to my tummy."}
{"text":"It's a Monday evening in Las Vegas. The streets are practically as barren as this restaurant. Although they are polite, I was told I needed a reservation. I have been here on a weekend several times without reservation, no problem.  Hmmm curious. I'm thinking I may not return"}
{"text":"Went to Tom's Urban in Las Vegas for Super Bowl party.  Food was excellent and service was top notch.  Big kudos to Darlene and Spencer for their wonderful customer service.  You guys were awesome!"}
{"text":"Live Toms Urban. We visit Vegas 3-4 times a year and the Bloody's are the best. They recently changed the mix from a handmade to a \"pre-mix\" and they aren't the same. The bartenders are still the best but they need to bring back the old school handmade Bloody mix. If you love bloody Mary's like me, ask for the original"}
{"text":"Located in New York, New York casino on the ground level. Has a patio where birds fly inside freely. A bird dropped a bomb on our table, lucky for us before drinks and food arrived. Oyr servwr Tori was great. She moved us to another area no problem.  My dining companion had a bloody mary and the steak breakfast burrito (very tasty). Their drink didn't have enough ice in it and it was warm. My m'lady mimosa was good. We had a Brussels sprouts starter/side. If you've been to Roast in Detroit and had their Brussel sprouts, nothing else compares. I had the spicy crispy chicken and cornbread pancake. Chicken had good flavor, but pancake got cold quickly. The maple syrup on the side added a good sweetness. Would come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here to redeem a MyVegas reward with my girlfriend for a buy one, get one free of a Tom's size beer. The beer was HUGE so it was a really good deal. I also got a burger which was pretty good too, but nothing to write home about. Service was really good too-beers were poured right when needed them and food came out quickly. Only negative is that it was a little pricy, but other than that, well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after visiting family from out of town and checking out The Strip. I can never pass up a nice plate of buttermilk pancakes. Service was great! Very accommodating despite my indecisive ordering skills. My pancakes were delicious, and huge!! Next time I'm in town I plan to come back here and give that Mac & Cheese a try!"}
{"text":"Lemon poppy blueberry pancakes and a traditional breakfast shared between hubs and I. Very good for casual dining. Server was eager and nice. The seating was a bit crappy for  two people so minus one star."}
{"text":"If you are on the strip walking around trying to find a place to eat, please start walking towards New York New York and walk into Tom's Urban. You will thank me later. This is my new spot to drop in for amazingly filling foods. I came in with a group of hungry girlfriends, and we left stuffed and ready to lay by the pool. We started off with bellinis that were absolutely perfect to hydrate from the Vegas heat. For food starters we got a bunch of the small plates to share, and the duck wings were amazing! If you are unsure of duck you have to try them. The sauce is a perfect sticky stick to the duck sauce, and you have to eat the slaw with it. Absolutely yum! Brussels sprouts, fried pickles, and spicy edamame were equally as amazing. I highly recommend the fried pickles because they are the ones you want and expect- perfect crispness and not dry at all. Okay being 7 girls ready to eat we ate, but we couldn't conquer because the portions are absolutely huge! I had the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese.... To Die For!!! It's baked, comes out in a skillet, and each bite will have seafood all the way till the end. One of the girls had the Hangover Slop, she said it's a must and didn't want to stop. I saw one of the girls having the eggs benedict and I was blown away at how huge the English muffins were. They could hold up to the thicker slices of ham on top!  Thank you Erron, Lina, and Carmen for the amazing customer service. You guys had the best recommendations. Lina was the sweetest for constantly refilling my water. It's so hot in Vegas and needed to rehydrate. Erron was our manager who came out to see how we were. Thank you being so kind and your awesome vibes.  Oh P.S. the homemade poptarts are a freaking must!!!!!  Coming back tomorrow... Or dinner..."}
{"text":"Post \"Ka\" cirque de soliel we decided to roll in for some light appetizers and a .  Great beer selection, plenty of southern cal craft beer choices.  We got the street tacos, mixed and matched to taste the variety, all were on point. Chicken potstickers were hit perfectly as well, great meal late night, I definitely recommend. Kaitlyn our server was amazing, constantly Checking on Us, made it a great experience. We will be returning"}
{"text":"We were drawn in by the great patio on the strip -- and it didn't hurt that the Yelp reviews were good.   Most in our group thought the food was great (one thought his green chile burrito was just OK).    I highly recommend the street tacos and pineapple upside down cake."}
{"text":"Amazing service from the moment I walked in. Corine was very welcoming when greeting and sitting us. We did not have a long wait and usually on Las Vegas Boulevard everything is so packed. Our server was Carmen and she was amazing. She checked up on us made sure we were doing okay the food was great and we did not feel rushed. Great restaurant! Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you the food is good. Our waitress was the best. I will come back. Rosa is the best ask for her"}
{"text":"This was our first time here , and our waitress paulina was great ! She attened us real good. She was always smiling when she came to our table. she was Very initiative and always made sure we had everything we needed and if our food was good. She recommended some good appetizers and they were great ! If you come to this restaurant, I suggest you request her ! I'm sure other waiters/waitress are good. But with her smiling all the time when she came to our table made a big difference in our night here in las Vegas."}
{"text":"My bf and I went there for dinner while in Vegas; everything was as expected. The food was good and tasty and we sat outside. That's definitely a plus. Service was very good as well as the ambiance and condition of the dinner. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Superb service! This place did not disappoint. The food was delicious and came with big portions. Make sure you say hi to the bartender Natalie, she was so nice and accommodating. One of the best places I've been on the strip."}
{"text":"Great casual food at a reasonable price.  Very friendly and gracious service. The Ghost Pepper Wings and Banh Mi tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Waited 15 minutes without even being acknowledged.  At 3 other tables received attention. Too many options in Vegas to put up with such poor customer service."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Food was good. Service was great. Good variety of food options as well. Our server Carmen was very attentive"}
{"text":"My partner and I were super excited to visit this restaurant after reading such great reviews. Service, or lack of was just horrible, first off the hostess was very rude and once we were seated, we waited for 20 mins and no one asked us if we wanted water or any cocktails. After sitting and waiting for 20 minutes we ended up leaving the restaurant.  Too bad because the restaurant has a really nice  ambiance and food looked good."}
{"text":"Good food plus bottomless mimosa! Our waiter, Charles was on point.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! I was seated immediately and had coffee and water shortly thereafter (It was 8:30 on a Wednesday). The service was perfect: attentive, not annoying. My coffee was always full and hot. I ordered the beach bum omelet with hash browns and sourdough toast. Huge portions, great flavor and not stupid expensive: $23 with tip and tax. The clean and modern atmosphere was very comfortable and there's a large outdoor seating area. I will be back."}
{"text":"No host present when we arrived. Once we were seated, no server ever showed up, so we went and sat at the bar. Bartender was very nice and let is sample a few beers. Food was very average and overpriced by 3 to 4 dollars. I would not go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone based on our experience. Very cool decor though."}
{"text":"Pretty cool new spot at NYNY. Typically don't come down to the strip to watch sports but came for the NCAA games.  We tried to call ahead for a table but they weren't taking any reservations.  Think it was because of St Patricks Day and March Madness.  No biggie though.  We grabbed shots and beers at the bar while we waited for a table since there was 6 of us.  Great beer selection and cool patio which was packed.  So, not really sure if it's a sports bar but there's lots of TVs and the host set us up with a great spot where we could see multiple games all at once which was cool.  Big food menu with lots to choose from.  Pretty awesome they serve breakfast all day.  I got the steak & eggs and lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes.   Both were on point and the portions were huge.  Way too much food!  Other guys got burgers, pork belly tacos, buffalo wings, steak and fries .  Gotta try the sin city burger next time.  It had a fried egg, fried onions, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Looked delicious and my buddy said he loved it.    For how busy they were, service was good too.  Our server Zooey was super cool.  2 of the steak dishes were over cooked so we had to send back.  She was very accommodating.  Of course they were too rare the 2nd time.  We're a fairly high maintenance crew though.  And I was good because my steak was cooked perfect.  Lol.  A manager did come by to apologize since they weren't to our liking even on the 2nd try.  He ended up bringing us a couple pop tarts (yeah, they have pop tarts!), a Fireball milkshake, a caramel Kraken milkshake and he took the steaks off our bill.  Pretty cool.  I've never had a milkshake with liquor in it.  Yummy stuff   Aside from the steak incident, everything was really good.  Interesting food with lots to choose from.  Cool vibe.  Good service.  Will definitely be back again soon"}
{"text":"There some in - depth reviews already on here, so I won't repeat and just provide a summary. My brother visiting wanted to try Shake Shack next door, but the thought of standing in line in 105 degree heat was not an option. We ended up at Tom's Urban after looking at the reviews. Brother had one of their burgers (sorry, I can't remember which one). He said it was very good and it was  cooked to order (med rare). I ordered steak and eggs. The filet medallions were excellent. I had ordered my eggs over easy and one of the egg yolks had broke. Next thing I know, a server brings me perfect over easy eggs, since the ones I had on my plate were not as they should be. WOW, that is very nice customer service. I wish I could remember her name...our server was so friendly, as were the rest of the staff we encountered; especially the guy that brought me more eggs. We were disappointed that some beers on their beer list was not avsilable, but we made do. It was a great place for my brother and I to enjoy the people watching and chat."}
{"text":"Came in to Tom's to eat on a Tuesday night and was met with a minor  disappointment to find out one of my favorite items was no longer on the menu. Well to my surprise Maggie my waitress went out of her way to go up the chain of command and find front of the house manager Joe who went and found us a guy who could replicate the old recipe for the shrimp and grits that we came here for. The next thing I know, the kitchen manager, Hancock, is personally delivering the original dish to our table and it was fantastic. I cannot say enough great things about the people who went above and beyond to make our dining experience great. Thank you to the entire staff tonight."}
{"text":"Was here for Brunch. Eggs Benedict was perfect as was my husbands breakfast burrito. Bloody Mary was excellent too!!"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday and talk about an overrated disappointment! Our food was cold and terribly prepared. Ordered two happy hour items (the fries and hummus) and it was obvious both had been sitting out for awhile... Fries limp and cold... The pita with the hummus was dried out. Blurgs! I then ordered the steak sandwich (can't remember exact item name) that I asked for medium rare. Gross... Chewy meat on a bun surrounded with unappetizing lettuce that had weird dollops of what looked like mayonnaise. Is that the best they could do for an entree that was over $20?! Sad.   The only positive were two things: The service staff and the drinks. I would give Tom Urban's another chance to prove me wrong... So get your act together please! Make it a priority to have pride in your food and what comes out of the kitchen, hot and fresh... My impression must be changed but now the ball is in your court!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Everything was flavored amazingly, especially the wings!!!  Perfect spot to eat on the strip! Our server, Maha, was so sweet, knowledgeable of menu, attentive & personable! Ask to be seated in her section & you will have such a great eating experience!!!"}
{"text":"Toms Urban is definitely a great place, outdoor seating shows a great view of the strip and passerby. EDDIE was a great server! Food should be coming soon and we`re both excited for it. Thanks for being an awesome dude Eddie!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, atmosphere is really cool, service at the bar is horrible-the girls don't ask if you want refill on cocktail or beer, they didn't bring us plates for our shared appetizers, and didn't check back once after our food was delivered."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to walk out because no one came to take my order after the hostess seated me."}
{"text":"Went for a drink to people watch from their porch.  The people watching is the only reason I give them even 1 star.  I ordered a Tom's Backyard Lemonade-- rum & \"fresh lemonade\"  My husband ordered a Mojo-jito that was supposed to have \"fresh lime\" juice in it, trust me there was nothing fresh in either drink.  Could possibly be the worst drinks ever!  We ordered the steak street tacos to split and they were equally revolting.  The tortilla was stale, the meat cold and impossibly chewy.  If you have to go here-get a bottle beer and skip the food."}
{"text":"After walking around New York street (indoor LV), we decided to stay in for lunch and came across to Tom's Urban, we were \"Lure in \"by the such pleasant host :) The menu is very simple; my son had Sin City Beef burger. :)  It was made is a juicy way mouth-watering delicious. (He said) The burger was perfectly prepared with fresh ground beef, toppings with onion rings and baby crunchy fries. I did not have much since the breakfast still hunting me , but my Brussels sprouts was prepared in the way unforgettable good . The sever keeps coming back for my hot H2O with lemon (I don't drink cold) It was a simple but very delicious lunch in New York!"}
{"text":"Nice bar/restaurant in the New York New York hotel, very quick service, the food is very good. Extensive menu ranging from street tacos to a New York strip. Lots of tables, room for large parties. Large Tvs all over the place, would definitely return again. The lobster Mac and cheese is delicious."}
{"text":"Eddie rocks ! Great food - great service! Great place good atmosphere!  Loved the chicken and the beer mugs"}
{"text":"me and my family drive 400 miles to share with the kids the pleasure in the shrimp and grits. ..... only to discover the menu had changed and it was no longer on the menu. not only were me and my husband disappointed but it honestly ruined the rest of the trip! highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this restaurant. The green chilli burger was perfect, the jerk ketchup was surprisingly delicious. The cocktails were excellent,  and the waitress was more than helpful and knowledgeable. Overall I loved the dining experience, and I look forward to returning for lunch and drinks!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing here!!  Pop tarts are a must!! The deserts are all great and service is wonderful"}
{"text":"Lousy service.  Was there 20 minutes before got any service at all. Food came about an hour after we got there. Only 3 other tables so not like it was busy. Saturday morning. Ordered the breakfast plate. Food was average but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and I knew I wanted to try it when we drove by. The decor is hip and modern and we weren't seated on top of anyone else which is always a plus. Our waiter was friendly and helpful but not really attentive. I'm pretty sure we had to ask for a drink refill.  Anyway, the food was good. It is a bit pricey even for the strip. I had the lobster sliders and polenta grits.  My grits were amazing! The sliders were good. Too much bread though. I pretty much left the entire second bun. My partner had the fried chicken. It was surprising because it's like chicken nuggets and I think it's just called fried chicken.   Oh, and a fireball milkshake. Can't really go wrong there! All in all 3.5 stars and nothing to complain about. Not sure I will go back though."}
{"text":"Our server was Emmanuel and he was awesome!!! It was my friend's birthday and he made it very special. The service was good and he didn't make us wait to refill our drinks, making sure we were alright and constantly checking on us! We will definitely come back here and look for Emmanuel. He made our night!"}
{"text":"Duck wings are legit.  Great service. Great view of strip and we were moved to a different table and received our 1st round of drinks for free."}
{"text":"Nice place, nice food, nice view but unfortunately very poor customer service . The waiter was really rude and literally yelled at me. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place with a great atmosphere and staff. We tried this place about 2 months ago when we visited last and this weekend my wife and I came back 3 more times and tried something new each time and everything we had tasted amazing. The street tacos, burgers, nachos, breakfast burrito, it was all delicious. Glad to find out there is another location closer to us in L.A. for us to go to. We had Michael for our server today and he was great. Very knowledgeable about the strip and fun to talk to, great member to be on that staff hands down. The drinks at the bar are also on point. There is thousands of places to eat on the strip but this is our go to for sure. Thanks for never letting us down."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5 pm on a Sunday and were promptly seated on the patio overlooking the Strip. Our server, Ashley, was fast, friendly and knowledgeable, providing many suggestions to help us navigate the huge and varied menu.   Crispy duck wings. OMG. The best thing I've eaten our entire stay in Las Vegas. The pork belly taco and buttery shrimp and lobster taco were excellent! The Mahi Mahi taco was not so good unfortunately. The fish was cold, hard, and tasteless. I told the server and she quickly brought me another pork belly taco to replace it.   Pretty pricey but a great experience! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my third time too Vegas and I am so mad I never came here. By far my favorite restaurant. Portions are huge, food is delicious and great drink price."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! Randy our server was super friendly and really attentive, we sat in the patio because the weather was perfect for it and they had misters to compliment it great for people watching, we had the duck wings and they were delicious the peanut slaw that came with it made them even better, my friend had the bacardi coconut shake it looked so good I had to to try it and OMG!!! SoGOOD!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good for breakfast but my only beef is that they don't open until 7 but not much in Vegas is open early.  I'm from the east coast and I'm always up early.  I got the Filet Mignon Benedict and it was perfectly cooked and tasted great and I thought it was a really good deal @ only $22.  Also they have bottomless mimosas til 11am for only $19 good deal.  Their Bloody Mary menu looked good but overpriced @ $13.50 each."}
{"text":"XL pickled Chicken Nashville was great. But most of all our server Frances was amazing. We've had 3 flights canceled, have been waiting and dealing with horrible flight representatives ... What a reprieve from the stress of today. Always came by with a genuinely happy  attitude to serve our table, cordial with explaining menu options and attentive to our needs and every requests. Bravo."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite places to eat and hang out when I come and visit. Kudos to the chef on the Avocado Shrimp Salad, it was really fresh and well composed. The best part was the patio seating and our server, I think his name was Nate. It was a really cool atmosphere and his service was on point. He was really personable, not like your typical Robot server you generally get. After we finished our apps, the main course came right on queue. Seriously great service and overall experience. Two recommendations: 1- Whoever made the menu (food and drink), keep them! 2- Higher more people like Nate (phenomenal server)"}
{"text":"The best pork belly tacos I've ever had Service was amazing I don't remember our waitress name but she did mention moving to Vegas to open this restaurant. She was super nice and made tons of delicious suggestions  thank you blondie!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service.!!!! Great ambiance their patio is a great location to people watch."}
{"text":"Order the Buffalo Chicken Sliders....amazing flavor.  The most unique homemade pop tarts are over the top delicious.  The Mule with special ginger beer is amazing.  And the crusted mahi-mahi is amazing.  The patio is beautiful and perfect for great weather days!"}
{"text":"Came here during a slow period and had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich ($15). It was just \"ok\". I felt the meat was a little overcooked and dry, while the sauce was nothing special. The service was fine, although they only had a greeter on the street side of the restaurant and when I entered in from the casino side, I had to wander around a little before someone offered to seat me. With so many other eating options on the Strip, I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Lobster & Shrimp Tacos. Nice spot for people watching. Service was a little bit slow but we weren't in rush."}
{"text":"Today my friends and I were pulled in from the strip to do a taste taste with drinks. Angelo,  Tyson and Darlene were awesome, gave us great service and very outgoing.  Drinks were awesome and Food was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast this morning and had an awesome experience! Our server Sam F. was awesome. She was very attentive and engaging. She answered all the questions we had about the menu and Vegas. The food was great too! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great atmosphere and great food on the strip!"}
{"text":"First let start by saying that by far one of the best spots for people watching on the patio.. we sat on the patio bar and ate with Natalie for breakfast.. he gave us some options  that we went with.. and we're happy for her.. we love this end of the strip and plan on coming again next trip"}
{"text":"Was here on a 4 day Vegas getaway with a girlfriend and we came back twice because we couldn't stop eating the grits!  Our server, Nate, was off the charts as far as service - SO personable, professional, knowledgable, and adorable to boot!  Awesome location and the patio environment is comfortable and entertaining.  We didn't find one thing we didn't enjoy on the menu . . . And bottomless Mimosas are WORTH it - total bargain from 6AM-1PM daily :) #NateistheBOMB"}
{"text":"Got ribs - they were pretty good.  Service not that great, they have a hard ass policy about not splitting checks for parties over 6.  the problem is that we are on per diem.  Dont come here for group meals"}
{"text":"First time at Tom's and I'll come back in a heartbeat! Food was great. Calamari, Sin City Burger, and the kale salad were delicious! The service was equally impressive. Darlene pulled double duty tending bar and serving us. Very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"We had ghost pepper wings(ok), filet Minton sliders(ok), grilled jalapeño edamame(mushy, over cooked, seemed steamed, disgustingly jalapeño favored), chicken pot stockers( came cold, very rubbery, different than pot stickers from asian restaurants), pork belly buns (soggy buns fall apart when you bite, mostly eating pork fat and shredded veggies). Server was cool tho I just wish the food came to my table hot, that probably would've helped. This place is so mediocre in a great location."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Tom's. Great draft beer selection! It was my first time in and I will definitely return on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Could have been that they were not prepared or hungover from the CES conventions. However, this place was incredibly overrated. Kitchen with less than 20 tables in the restaurant was backed up by an hour. Wait was 30 minutes to sit when clearly there was multiple tables open. After sitting 15 minutes to get drinks. Food came 1 hour later. So all in all was my burger that good? Not exactly. I would say In -N - Out for 75% less than our bill is just as good if not better.   It could be the fact the were an hour late on food service so they hurried through to make it. But being on the strip with competition of the best restaurants to eat in the casinos I would have expected more."}
{"text":"Well, food good, not excellent but good. Service lacking. About 20 mins with a table full of empty plates and glasses before we received check. Just hard to get excited about Vegas prices for a lackluster experience."}
{"text":"This is the best resturant that I have been to on the Vegas Strip. It started with the hostess Malana who was kind and courteous and remembered my fiancee. Our server Micheal was amazing! I cant say enough about how great he was. He made my fiancee nice. She said she was so amazed at how great he was. He was enganging and attentive. The food was so good! The manager Jerome came by and made sure everything was good and made sure we were comfortable. This place is the best on the strip! I hope when I come back to Vegas these great people are working. Please stop by this resturant! The Adoba Chicken Tacos are so good!"}
{"text":"This review is based on service only. We had Kyle as our server and he was amazing! He was friendly, helpful, even caring when he saw that I was freezing under the a.c. and offered  to move to a more comfortable table. He made us feel super comfortable and was always checking in on us making sure we were ok. He made our entire brunch experience AMAZING! I wish there was more waiters like Kyle! Tom's urban is very lucky to have Kyle!"}
{"text":"Best service in town.  TV's everywhere so there isn't a bad seat in the place."}
{"text":"Went back to Toms Urban Friday May 1st. We again had wonderful food and way better service. There were 6 of us and drink orders were taken promptly and our food order was mostly accurate ( my wife was brought steak nachos instead of steak tacos ) but that was a minor glitch compared to last time. We all enjoyed the food and I was happy I gave Toms Urban a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Loved it in Denver, but it is even better in Vegas.  The bar by the strip is a great place to hang and in warmer weather to people watch.  The food is great and not the same stuff you get everywhere else.  The staff seems to be happy to be there and happy you are there.  Ask your bartender to make his/her best drink and enjoy.  You have got to try the Hangover Slopper."}
{"text":"went there because we were drawn in by how good the menu sounded. Food was terrible. Worst food I've had In Vegas. Was excited to try the duck wings as I've had them other places before. The sauce was overpowering and you couldn't taste the actual wings. I ordered the Cleveland hot brown which was a pile of soggy meat covered in cheese. I don't know what the flavor was supposed to be but it was not to my taste. The garlic fries on the side tasted like eating a pure garlic clove. Gave this place 2 stars because the service was quick and our server felt bad I didn't like my food so she took it off the bill."}
{"text":"Had breakfast and it was AWESOME!  Wait staff was a little slow and we were just a few of their customers. Bottomless Mimosa was worth it but those too were slow to arrive."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch and because I was really wanting to try their dark and stormy. The dark and stormy was pretty standard, and very boozy - no complaints here. I ended up having the Treehugger eggs benedict with bacon. This was possibly the tastiest eggs benny I have ever had. We sat at the bar and had a good conversation with the very friendly bartender. Food and drinks came out quickly. The only reason this review isn't five stars is just due to the fact that the meal ended up being a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Had the Portobello + swiss burger and this is what a burger should be. Great taste and the fries went perfect with it. I'll be back to handle the rest of the menu ASAP!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got a lovely waitress, forget her name though. We had the pulled pork sandwich and the blt lobster roll. The pulled pork was really good! Loved the cole slaw, had big apple chunks that added texture. The lobster roll was really good too, but would have liked some more flavour and bigger pieces of lobster. Loved the overall vibe and decor! Would come back again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome! Had basic two eggs, hash browns, sausage & toast. Also got kids portion lemon poppyseed blueberry pancake. Hash browns & pancake were 10's! Everything else was very good. Great service this morning. Was also there for dinner and street tacos were very good!"}
{"text":"So I guess I spoke too early? We had such a good experience yesterday at breakfast we decided to give it a whirl for dinner. We got seated right away. It wasn't that busy. Perfect I thought, \"I'm starving!\" So we go through the menu... I'm getting the Sin City burger! My girl even figured out what she wanted.... So far it's been about 7 minutes. No one has taken our drink order, said \"hi I'll be right there\" nothing.... The people next to us got their food, changed their minds, asked for it to go, got boxes for everything, got their check, paid and left and still we sat there... Feeling kinda dumb at this point.  It has now been almost 10 to 13 minutes with no service what so ever!  So I asked my girl if she wanted to go and she what I was thinking \"yeah let's go. They don't seem to care that we are here.\"  So we got up and left. No one said a word. So FAIL today Toms . So we ended up at New York pizzeria."}
{"text":"Great food,great drinks and great atmosphere!! I will recommend Tom's to all my friends. A Must Go!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Delicious breakfast. The Toms Party Starter was great! We loved our server Tina. She rocks!"}
{"text":"Had a tough time getting seated with the ditsy hostess.... she seemed scattered and unhappy to be there. She was busy talking with her co worker instead of getting us out of the cold weather, then she actually checked her phone before greeting us!! Server said her name was Yasmin, Brunette looked young probably 21, I asked her if she was having a nice holiday week and she replied 'Well I'm here....so...4 people?'. The food was okay but not exceptional especially with the high prices...but it is right on the strip with a good view. Server was nice enough but not really engaging. Lots of other places to go to so you aren't missing out by skipping this spot."}
{"text":"So, 6 of us sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant. It took, let me see, about 20 minutes of someone to attend to us for just a presence of a server to talk to us. We asked about happy hour, server LISA said it won't be until 11pm. Ok fine so we decided to let her know that we will think about it and she said she will be right back. Literally NO one was on this restaurant. We had our mind set and ready to order. We asked a gentleman to ask for our server because it was time to order. (11pm happy our time). We kept waiting hoping Lisa would come, but she was just standing with her Co worker at our eye site looking at us and not doing anything at all. It's past 15 minutes, no water, no service we all decided to just leave the place. Being LOCAL checking out this new place. That was a terrible service.. in which this is being in the strip, expectations of good customer service should be implemented. Therefore, we went to CPK next door and received phenomenal customer service from Austin."}
{"text":"We arrived and sat on the patio. Our server took a few minutes to come to our table. They were pretty steady so we understood. He finally came over and we could tell right away how uninterested he was at doing his job. He was not friendly or welcoming at all. He took our drink and food order and thats about it. We received our food and he never checked on us or asked how everything was. We got finished with a couple of our plates and we sat them on the chair next to us because we didnt have room on the table. Our server walked by numerous times and failed to stop and pick them up. We even saw a manager that was standing right next to our table. He seemed more content socializing and hugging all over the hostesses instead of making sure things were ok and that our dirty dishes which at this point were attracting flies were removed. When the server would ask if we were ok it was just passing by not coming by the table. He finally dropped our check and when he finally ran our card and brought it back he didnt even thank us. Overall TERRIBLE service and terrible management."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! I ordered the truffle portabello burger with garlic fries and was MORE than satisfied. the burger was a perfect medium rare, nice and juicy with a ton of flavor. Nate was an awesome server, extremely personable, and if you get the bottomless mimosas, he will make sure you get your moneys worth!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. The food is amazing you must try the brusslesprouts. Big restaurant so you don't have to wait that long. Fun place to watch  football, hockey, and soccer(football). Patio is beautiful and fun environment. For desserts I honestly truthfully, you need, it's a must you have got to try the home made pop tarts, I can't even begin to describe how amazing it is, you need to eat them while they are warm. It tastes like heaven"}
{"text":"The had good review so we decided to go there for the last night in Vegas. The service was just awful. We waited for almost an hour for our very simple food to arrive. A different waiter came up to us asking if we got our food yet and was surprised that we haven't. Apparently, kitchen messed up our order and so they gave us extra tacos( which we didn't even finish as we didn't want to eat much). Our drinks took forever and the waiter was clearly having troubles with other customers. We constantly saw that people were coming up to him and com playing about something. In the end they messed up with our check and overcharged us. The waiter said that he couldn't find his manager so he decided to give us cash instead . He was really rude. It was just really bad timing I guess"}
{"text":"Street tacos really good. German sized beer a huge plus. Service a little slow good thing we were not in a hurry. I would go back."}
{"text":"Seriously the greatest food! The sat us quickly and got our orders. The waiter took a while To give Us everything but the food was good and so we're the drinks. I ordered the lettuce wrapped tacos and a Moscow mule. Both delicious."}
{"text":"6 of us stopped in for breakfast.  The weather was perfect so we opted for patio.  The hostess didn't seem happy to see our group as she squeezed 2 tables and arranged a few chairs to accommodate us.  As a group we had the urban breakfast platter, killer chilaquiles, colorado hot brown & the urban slopper.  We all like to share so everyone can try a few different items.  It was all very good but the hot brown got the majority vote.  One in the group picked a shake called the Kraken, unbelievable!! That shake was so good we all ended up with one & wondered how we could get a kraken IV drip to wheel around with us on the strip.  After the initial seating experience, it was awesome.  Great table service, atmosphere, food & drink."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted pancakes in the middle of the day, but everyone else wanted lunch!  Great service, great food.  Came with a party of three we had carnitas tacos, carnitas ruban sandwich with garlic fries, and buttermilk pancakes. Everything was cooked well, and delicious!  Our server was on top of our tea refulls and the food was also served in good time. The atmosphere was nice, table and seating was clean. Very glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Service was awesome!!!! My favorite is the avocado and shrimp salad it is the best!!! The Sin City punch is the best drink!!!! So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Very cool environment with good service!  The highlight was the Crispy Duck Wings!  The lowlight was the hard to eat Brussels Sprouts, due to the way they were prepared.  The Alcoholic Milkshakes were definitely a plus as well!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual breakfast joint after a long night out and we were not disappointed in the slightest. The cheese on the hash browns, the strong coffee, and the excellent service completely made this my new favorite breakfast in Las Vegas. Maggie was the sweetest and most efficient server also. I would go back just for her..AND the adult milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Four stars are for the Blueberry pop tart. It was delicious and something I would never usually consider.  My margarita pizza however was terrible. It was dry, hard and smaller than I expected. There was virtually no flavor to it.   My husband said his burrito was pretty good though.   Just stay away from the pizza and I think you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with a wonderful server for breakfast today! I had the urban breakfast platter that was delicious and reasonably priced! My server Maha was very attentive, knowledgable about the food and suggested this item! She was friendly, funny and very pleasant and attentive to my needs! This was my first time eating here and I will be back tomorrow to ask for my same server!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Was expecting more based on a friends  referral but the food was average and the service was slow and left me disappointed. $38 for a steak so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts small plate was on point but overall would not return to this spot."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday based on recommendation for good food and place to watch football games. Very large menu and everything we ordered was fantastic (both from breakfast menu and regular). Definitely recommend this spot and will be returning."}
{"text":"To sum up Tom's Urban in 3 words: Excellent customer service.  Came here before we had to go to the airport.  After waiting for an hour, the manager approached us and told us that it did not usually take this long to get our food and comped our meal.  The portions were large and the food above average.  Outside seating provides a lot of people-watching opportunities."}
{"text":"I decided to venture out of my Vegas comfort zone and grab a bite to eat at Tom's because it's in the hotel I stayed in.   It's a nice looking spot with a great outside patio. It's probably a great spot for people watching and drinks.  However, the lunch service was poor and the food was mediocre. No one in our group of 6 was impressed with either. In particular, the fig jam and cheese sandwich was bland and the fries that came with it were undercooked.   With so many good restaurants on the strip, I should've keep on looking. Then again, nothing ventured, nothing gained."}
{"text":"Personally, would not come here ever again.  I visit NY NY Hotel & Casino multiple times a year and decided to give this place a try for lunch.  The hostess was rude and her attitude appeared as you were bothering her.  The waiter seemed more interested in sitting with the table behind us chit chatting for a good five minutes per visit instead of taking our order or checking on how we were doing.  We got a glass of ice water that had cilantro stuck on the glass.  Decided on ordering one of \"Tom's Favs\" which was their steak nachos and also their mahi mahi fish tacos.  Nothing special about the nachos...it had multi color tortilla chips, cheddar cheese sauce, SOME shredded cheese, leftover steak (you can taste that it wasn't fresh), a tiny serving each of guacamole paste and dressing, sour cream, and a little bit of salsa.  The fish tacos were extremely dry...no sauce or anything to go with it.  Just the fish, some lettuce or cabbage and a lime wedge on top of a corn tortilla.  Overall, the atmosphere was nice, but the table set ups were kinda weird.  I guess they want to be \"different\" and to each their own.  I think it could be a happening place if their service and food was better.  For the price you pay ($21.95 for a burger by itself) you would think this place would be more upscale and have amazing food to brag about, but it's not and they don't."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Las Vegas has tons of good places to eat but don't let that deter you.   The food was great! And the drinks were fantastic and strong. You should order \"She's My Niece\" (they changed the name but they shouldn't have) or \"WTF\" but really, they are probably all good. Also the sweet potato fries were nothing short of the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten.   Beyond the food, I loved the atmosphere; it was casual and fun looking. The music was eclectic and fantastic, it was like having my iPod on shuffle back before streaming music.   And our waitress Davina, was quite entertaining and nice. The service at many places during CES was boring and not great, likely because it was busy, but this place - wonderful. She really made the experience.   I came in with reasonable expectations and was blown away.   It's great."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service!!  Thanks Eddie!!  Eddie went above and beyond to make our meal great, including tracking down some hot tea and honey since our 9 year old wasn't feeling well."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. Service was impeccable. Our waiter Paul and the other staff were very attentive. The place is clearly well staffed, as they all seemed to work well together even with a high volume of customers. Meal was delicious and well prepared.My avacado cheddar omelet was nicely seasoned, with a hint of rosemary.  My husband and I both loved the creamy grits as our side.  Portions were more than generous."}
{"text":"I am a local, and very rarely venture off to the strip.  We went to see Billy Joel at the new Arena, and decided to grab a midnight snack once the concert let out. We opted for Toms. The restaurant wasn't too busy, which was perfect after being surrounded by thousands of people singing at the top of their lungs. The menu is quite large, and filled with all kinds of treats. We decided to go family style which was advised by our server - Miranda. She was super helpful with the menu, and directed us the right way.  We really loved the vibe of toms!!!  The manager came over to check on us, she even sat and chatted with my wife about the concert.  We were treated as though we were regulars, and trust me, after this awesome experience, staff, and food - we will be! Great job Toms!"}
{"text":"We stayed at NewYork New York, and were thrilled to find this restaurant in our hotel.  Our first experience was so good, we went back 3 times during our 4 night stay.  Each time the servers and managers were wonderful.  We spent a morning with Charles, who was a great breakfast server.  He never let anyones endless mimosa glass get too low, and his recommendations were spot on.  We try to go to Las Vegas every year, and we will definitely be stopping at Tom's Urban no matter what hotel we stay at!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience last night. Was seated for 15 minutes before a server appeared. Had to ask for utensils, napkins, and water. Once order was placed, it took 27 minutes to be brought to our table. During the 27 minutes I complained to the hostess 3 times before a manager appeared . She had no excuses for the service and did discount my bill. The server never once said \"I'm sorry\". Many opportunities to, as he passed my table numerous times. I am a Las Vegas resident, I will not bring any out of town visitors to this restaurant. One more thing, restrooms are \"one holers\", amazing for a restaurant of this size. Lines all the time."}
{"text":"Thank you Lori for the really great service when we were in on the 16th for breakfast. I was with my daughter and her boyfriend.  You really made our morning, great service, attitude and sense of humour! Everyone there took very good care of us!  Thanks again Lori!! Oh food was great too"}
{"text":"Good food- unique menu- good drinks.  The staff at Toms is what made this place.  Everyone we asked, \"what's good here?\"  They had recommendations- and best of all- they said what they DON'T like- which, honestly... I don't think anyone at any other restaurant has ever said to me.  It made a huge difference knowing what to avoid.  I had the chicken &pancake- savory sweet.  Get the sauce on the side!  Wow- it's HOT!  It is not buffalo sauce... it's much hotter.  We also had the Brussel sprouts, and the steak nachos- yum!  Someone had the potsticker salad which he was practically licking the plate- looked amazing!  Someone else had the Figgy piggy sandwich- fog spread, ham, cheese grilled... didn't even leave me a bite!?  I had the sangria rojo- great taste!  My 4 star is that I don't like how expensive the food/drinks are.  I understand- you're in business- and the restaurant is not likely affiliated with the casino- and the rent is probably astronomical... BUT- $9 for a sangria mixed drink? $6 and it would have been 5 stars here, folks."}
{"text":"Great staff and even better food. Burgers and tacos were both great. Sin City burger was my favorite and I'd order it again."}
{"text":"Go next door to shake shack! We were told it would be 10 minutes for a table. We were a larger group so we were ok with waiting. It took 30 minutes to sit down in an empty restaurant. It took another hour to get out food. Again... an empty restaurant. Then a meal didn't come for 1 person in the party and a burger was undercooked for another. Our drinks were left at the bar to the point we had to get up and get them ourselves. Still no real apology from anyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and my breakfast burrito was delicious. The view of the strip was great and I loved getting to sit outside."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here had a piggy omelette and the French toast. The food was great, large portions, and we had great service. I definitely recommend this as a breakfast stop especially for hotel guests. Even without a promotion or coupon we had breakfast for two, both of us had food left over and we were out less than $30."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar and Steve waited on us. He was very attentive and over all a pleasure. The kitchen was slow and it took a while for food to come out but he made sure to check in on us to make sure we didn't need anything. The Brussels sprouts were awesome as were the fries 2 way. We had a couple of drinks that were awesome as well, one was the mule and the other was a gin, cucumber and strawberry drink."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here in Vegas, we've had 4 dishes (all excellent)...great food, exceptional service...definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very slow service; all the customers just sit around waiting for servers.  I wonder who manages this dump.  Should have left because food took forever and sucked.  Don't go here.  Better places around the corner!!!"}
{"text":"Food: Came in to watch the game and ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was fantastic. However the garlic fries were below average, thankfully the bartender noticed and replaced them with regular fries without me even asking! Drinks were solid and not watered down.   Staff: Steph was my bartender and she was awesome! Bundle of personality and super attentive to customers. She was cracking jokes and made the entire experience at toms something to remember."}
{"text":"A great location for our early breakfast (at 7 am) due to jetlag. My husband and I managed to share a portion as they are large but tasted really well. And the pancakes for our child was delicious and came with tasty berries. All in all, we will come back!"}
{"text":"Although I said I would never go back, my wife loves the duck wings here so we decided to give it another go. The place was relatively empty for a Friday evening so I was a little worried that there was a problem. We sat at the main bar and were immediately greeted by Danni who was very friendly, upbeat and professional.  Bar service was excellent.  Dani got our drinks right away and checked back with us regularly to see if we were ready for another round or needed anything else. We ended up ordering some appetizers (duck wings and sliders).  The one thing that has not changed about this pace is the inordinate amount of time it takes to get food from the kitchen to the table. I didn't time it but the place was 75% empty and it must have taken 20-30 minutes to get two appetizers.  When the food finally did arrive it was hot and fresh and very good so no problems with quality.  I ended up telling Dani about the last review I did and told her how much we appreciated the professional service we were receiving from her.  Dani let us know that she was the bar manager, which we were both glad to hear since that will hopefully influence the overall performance of the staff at the bar.  There was another bartender on that night (Stephanie?) who was also very friendly and professional so it looks like Dani is managing her team well.  Dani also bought us a round of drinks which was a very classy thing to do. It was definitely a better experience this time than we had in January but if it were not for Dani I would on the fence because of the slooow food service. At this point, I'd say it was overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Cheryl is the best waitress ever. She was funny, responsive, talented and sweet. She took great care of us!  We came in and got 50% off of one of our party's check because her name starts with a \"T\". What a great deal! I think that's just for February, but still, it was a fantastic surprise. It encouraged her to get a 5 shot souvenir shaker. Yeah, we're going to have to roll her out of here."}
{"text":"Here in Vegas for a conference and I am exhausted after a long day!! Came into Toms Urban for dinner and I'm glad I did. The food is fantastic!! And server Eddie was terrific! Very pleasant attitude and went above and beyond to make sure everything was just right."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try a different place for Breakfast and decided to try Tom's Urban.  Should have probably left when our coffee arrived in dirty cups (I had to wipe the red lip stick off my rim, so it was pretty obvious they weren't clean cups). I ordered an Omelet and my wife Eggs Benedict.  My omelet was editable, but the toast seemed to be made from day old bread and left under the warmer too long. My wife's meal was way too dry (the pork meat was very dried out), and she ended up just picking the egg off the top. Maybe Breakfast wasn't their thing... However, the issues we experienced would translate to any meal at this place.  We won't be back.  Also, this place is VERY expensive. breakfast for two cost us over $70..."}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow as it seemed our poor waitress was one of only a few working and they were really busy. However, we were in no hurry and enjoying the Sunday morning breakfast on the porch. She was great and very friendly. The food was OUTSTANDING!  The chicken tacos were so good I plan to eat them every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The only reason why I didn't give this a higher score really came down to customer service we went there around 11:30 on a Tuesday night for a late night snack. We checked out the menu it was really awesome good variety and we could sit on the patio which was right on the strip! The sweet potato fries and eggs were good milkshakes were also good but on the pricy side. The part that sucked was the wait and miscommunication among servers. We had a total of 3 servers. One apparently was cut and left without letting us know or anyone else I guess as we had to ask someone for our bill after a good half hour of watching server after server walk by us. It's to bad we would have loved to go back but it wasn't worth it when there are so many great restaurants with servers that go out of their way to help you.  Update Even though our experience in the restaurant was poor I appreciate that Mr.Winter contacted me personally via email and addressed my concerns. My husband and I will give Tom's Urban another go and hopefully we can really enjoy our experience, after all it is a pretty trendy little restaurant with a great location!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the drinks were great. The bottomless mimosas/bellinis can't be beat! But the best part was the service!!! Our server Nate was always on top of it. The only thing that prevents this from being 5 stars is the price.  #NateTheGreat"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, short wait times. I'll come back again! I had the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese - large portion size and so creamy. I couldn't finish it all!"}
{"text":"Great place and our waiter, Mr. Chocolate, was the best. My wife had the salmon and I had the adobo tacos. Very delicious"}
{"text":"Eddie was awesome and had great recommendations from beer wine and food amazing service ! Hitting this place up when ever we are here . No wait . Top service"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Tom's Urban about middle of the afternoon and it was pretty slow.  The service was very prompt and friendly. 5/5  We ordered:  Pork belly steam buns- Great bread texture and flavor.  I wanted more but there were only 2 per order.  Street tacos- pork, steak, and chicken. The chicken was average and the pork had great flavor but a little too salty for my taste.  The steak had great flavor and my favorite of the 3.  Pineapple upside down cake- Unique twist, as the cake is drizzled with caramel and mango sauce. The mango is quite differentiating. It was delicious! Would definitely order again.   The prices are higher than expected for the type of menu, but normal for Vegas. Would come back."}
{"text":"We had a casual lunch at the bar at Tom's Urban.  The owner happened to be quietly sitting next to us so maybe that's why but the service was great.  They have decent beers aside from the crappy regular options, cocktails are nice and the food is bar style but pretty decent. Definitely a good spot for a casual lunch or dinner and even better when the weather is nice and you can sit outside!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great breakfast/brunch place on the strip? You can go ahead and scroll past this one! Horribly slow service, and she was a quiet talker to boot. It took us 15 minutes just to get our first coffee pour. Hashbrowns and toast very under done and under buttered. Their saving grace and the reason they get 2 stars instead of 1...the homemade pop tarts."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 all approved. It is a cool spot, service was good. Food was tasty, a wide selection of interesting items...AND they serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus! I also enjoyed the bacon bourbon bloody mary and house made pop tarts :) Overall, a good experience and I will certainly return."}
{"text":"I did greatly enjoy my meal, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming.  Highly recommend getting the home made pop tart, and do not share.   The server was a bit unprepared to handle an allergy for my group. We had a member of our party with a gluten allergy and she asked if he was actually allergic or just avoiding. (Not an actual question one should ask)"}
{"text":"Urban bloody mary & Huevos Benedicto...so good!!!! Perfect for Sunday brunch. Outside seating and the nice weather was the cherry on top. Rosa you rock!!!!"}
{"text":"So sad. I ordered the goat cheese and arugula salad to go. When I arrived at my destination to dig in to my salad, there was no goat cheese and hardly any green apple but ample red pepper. The arugula is spicy enough on its own. If you have goat cheese in the name, you gotta put it on the salad!"}
{"text":"I don't know how full this review might be but needless to say i went in with my friends and waited to be served for about 10 minutes and no one even looked at us or offered us a menu. The worst part was that it was pretty dead. The bartenders just kept passing by cleaning and asking customers with beer and food how they were doing. Terrible first impression. Will not even attempt to come in again."}
{"text":"Terrible food lettuce was wilted - hamburger ordered was raw. Complained to the waitress that ordered a salad never got it. Fell on deaf ears they don't care."}
{"text":"Food was OK, horrible horrible service though. Only reason these guys are in business is due to their location. Your location is good, and they get a lot of walking traffic from the arena nearby. If you like people watching, sit on the patio. You will see a lot of things. But the food is mediocre at best, and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"There is literally nothing redeeming about this restaurant except it's location. I ordered the breakfast BLT... that came without bacon. Maybe the most pathetic sandwich the world has ever seen. And when I pointed this out to the waitress she told me she'd just bring me some bacon because taking it back would take too long. So she brought me three (3) small pieces of bacon... I actually had to ask the manager for more bacon to make it a decent sandwich. And then they all acted put out and rude for the rest of our meal and didn't offer anything to make it right.   Oh! And for this HUGE restaurant on the Strip you have to wait in line to use the single toilet restroom. How is that even up to code?  Avoid this place like the plague..."}
{"text":"I love this new spot! A very unique twist on traditional American food with a great atmosphere and staff. I was surprised by how large the restaurant is when inside. A big bar area is in the middle but there is also a huge amount of sitting elsewhere that make this a great place for groups or even to bring kids. Our waiter (wish I could remember his name) was so awesome with my son and was super friendly. My husband and I shared the sliders and the pepperoni pizza... Both were awesome! The portion sizes looked pretty tiny but were surprisingly filling. A little pricy but that's to be expected when dining on the strip. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Toms Urban has to be one of the best restaurants on The Strip! My fiancé had the ribs and he said they were so delicious. The meat literally kept falling off the bone! I had the Bacon Avocado burger and it was equally delicious. We definitely recommend that every one check this place out the next time they're in Vegas and be sure to ask for Chester to be your server! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Eddie was a great waiter with an excellent personality. He was attentive and friendly. Would definitely recommend coming here for dinner make sure you sit in Eddie's section."}
{"text":"This place is fucking garbage bad service. Especially the bartending area, I found a cockroach in my burger."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place with a good amount of options. There's no kid menu, but they offered about 5 breakfast and lunch/dinner options. They don't have particularly vegan/gluten-free options, but I was able to price together a good lunch with a side salad, Brussels sprouts, and hummus. They subbed the flatbread for tortilla chips for me as well. They were flexible with the menu, which was nice. Atmosphere is nice with some relevant music going. The beer and cocktails menu is huge, and they offered coconut water cocktails. Overall I found it to be pretty good for my family's diverse needs (mine gluten-free/vegan, my husband's carnivore tendencies, and my son's desires for pancakes all day)."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Had the huevos Benedict and they were awful. only the spice of Chile made it tolerable and compensated for the lack of real taste. waited twenty minutes for the waitress to even take our order. mind you she was delightful afterwards, which I'm thankful for. the outside looks good to sit in but the cushions are sullied with every past meal. come here to drink and people watch. go to Denny's for a better meal. oh and the hashed browns have no potato... they are all cheese."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in her for breakfast our first morning in town.  The food was simply amazing, the bottomless mimosa is the way to go but what made our experience most memorable was the server.  Big shout out to Amy!! Thank you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Went to eat on a tuesday afternoon and it wasnt too busy. We walked in because the outdoor dining area was right on the strip and looked like a great place to have lunch, and then we asked to sit inside, go figure. Our hostess Amariah was very friendly and suggested a few items that we tried. We were not dissapointed. The shrimp and grits was first and it was a wonderful dish. It was a tasting plate big enough for two people. For entrees we had the colorado hot brown and the street taco plate. Both were large, although pricey dishes. They were excellent and everything was cooked perfectly. I was planning on ordering one of the many different milkshakes but was too full after my meal, i guess i have a reason to go back now. Great lunch. Would be 5 stars if it wasnt so pricey."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Slow, but friendly service. Chopped salad was attractively presented but proportionally too much cabbage & not enough protein. Dressing on the side was tasty but unoriginal."}
{"text":"The service, food, atmosphere and staff at Tom's Urban are beyond amazing!  You literally cannot go wrong any time of day here.  Anything you could possibly be craving is on the menu.  The food quality does not disappoint.  The staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  I was there during a football game and hung around a little longer than usual.  I didn't feel rushed out like most strip side venues, too eager to turn the table.  Erron, the GM, personally stopped by each table, which was a plus.  I'd highly recommend this place to anyone.  Plus, the curbside views can't be beat!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pancakes, veggie omelette and service. best breakfast in Vegas - hands down.  Ask for Rpsa. Corinne who greets you at the front is super too!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the drinks were great, and the experience was GREAT! I loved the Southern Charmer drink I ordered! This is definitely going to be a Vegas tradition for me!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was bomb! Breakfast burritos with steak is a must! The staff is exteremly friendly and helpful! Hands down great experience! Make this a stop on your Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this 1 star, except they have a great deal on bottomless mimosas.  We have been going here since the place opened.  It use to be our go to place.  Service has gone down hill.  I was told I can't order the hashbrowns with cheese (I know I can I have many times in the past).  When delivered I asked the food runner \"when did they stop doing them without cheese\". I was told by him 100% can be done without cheese and went back and got a fresh order.  Bartender took forever to come over to us (too busy cutting limes to even look up at the only 2 people pretty sitting in front of her).  Another server told the a bartender \"a lot people are now at your bar\"  he replied \"they can wait\".  This was Super Bowl Sunday.  Get with the program. They even opened 15 minutes late.  Three people were waiting to get the price for the Super Bowl party and we could hear the phone ringing and they never picked up.  I rarely write reviews.  Felt I had this review was needed.  So many place in Vegas to go, I would avoid this one."}
{"text":"Let's just say, fireball milkshakes, bottomless mimosas, great food, joyful, helpful servers...what more can you ask for?!  Be sure to ask for Nate as a server he is the bomb dot com! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"This was disappointing! We started out strong with a wonderful host staff that greeted and seated us, however from there things went down hill. For a Friday morning the restaurant is slow so we expected quick service, we didn't get it, as a result our food came out slow and cold. The breakfast burrito was bland, the breakfast nachos so cold when they arrive the cheese had congealed. The one bright spot was the breakfast platter, which would have been fantastic except the toast was cold. Great atmosphere, nice people, poor service, cold food."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give Tom's Urban a poor review but honestly their food is mediocre at best and not worth the money. Skip this place and go to another restaurant right next door on the Strip. So sad because the patio has a great view of the strip but the food is pathetically pricey and unoriginal especially given what it is. Sadly, I have a gluten allergy and when I asked about their options, I had two choices. I opted for the grilled salmon mango salad and when they brought it to the table, I got a bland piece of salmon served with white leaf cabbage and cucumbers. That's it. Where's my mango? Clearly no flavor of any kind. So I asked if I could have some GF dressing plus a few spinach leaves & tomatoes. No dressing choices for me and they charged $2 for a super tiny portion of spinach. Just awful. If you're into deep fried, buttered, super salty, bland food drenched in sauce then maybe this place will strike your fancy. But in Vegas, come on.... You have to do better than that. Up your game and add some creative options so that others can enjoy tasty food too. Discover flavor in the kitchen and add some creativity to your food. Only way to survive in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time visitor at Tom's Urban. I'm not usually a breakfast eater especially in Vegas and had read the reviews and decided to give it a try. 1st off the breakfast potatoes were to die for. We were in the door right after opening and were greeted by the hostess who was extremely personable and spent a few minutes making the wife and I welcome after seating us. Tina was our server and gets a 5 out of 5 in my book. Food was great. not real busy this morning so we had the manager come by and visit for a moment and was much appreciated. I have to give a 4 only because I don't ever give 5s. except for Tina. stop in I definitely recommend breakfast. sorry for the ramble, bottomless Mimosa's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On vacation with my family and I'm restaurant hopping. Decided to stop in at Tom's to try a appetizer. I settled for the Mac-N-Cheese(they are pricey, especially for the portion sizes). The atmosphere is really cool, good music, plenty of tvs, and CLEAN. Growing up in the Midwest and living in the south for some time I was a bit skeptical because I like REAL mac-n-cheese. The mac-n-cheese was just a tad bit runny, just a little. It came with pick de gallo, pork green chilis, and green onions. The combination of different flavors wasn't bad at all. On a scale of 1-5 I give it a 4.4  I would recommend this place. Can't wait to try something different during my next visit."}
{"text":"My first review!!   Relatively new to Las Vegas, not much of a strip fan or into the scene. A co-worker recommended Tom's so I thought I would give it a try with a friend.   The food was great but the service is the reason I will be coming back. Our server Dom was fantastic, he was friendly but not fake, well versed on the menu and made great suggestions. He checked on us multiple times and actually seemed to care if we liked our food. I have had a ton of bad service in restaurants that were supposed to be \"nice\", so I would easily recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best breakfast for a fair price in Vegas. I ordered the bacon avocado and cheddar omelet. It was a four egg omelet and came with hash browns and toast for 13.50. The omelet was cooked perfectly folded American style and they did not skip on the toppings. Each bite including the edges had bacon. The hash browns were the BEST hash browns I have ever had. They were crispy and not super greasy they were filled with a cheese that I forget the name of and I ate most of them before I realized how much I had eaten. I also received the wheat toast which came with preserves. Not sure if it is house made but it was absolutely delicious even the table next to ours was blown away. My girlfriend ordered the traditional breakfast which was 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns, and toast. I can't remember the price of hers. But she also ordered one pancake ala carte. The traditional breakfast for her was perfect same type of hash browns and the eggs were cooked with out being watery or over cooked. The bacon she ordered came out crisp and perfect. The pancake she got was the size of the plate and came with a salted caramel butter and warm maple syrup. I tried the salted caramel butter myself and was instantly a fan. I usually do not like caramel but this was balanced enough that the caramel flavor was not over powering.   The service we received from Nicole was wonderful she gave us a \"tour\" of the menu when we first arrived. And was always there when we needed her. We never had to ask for refills on anything. She even grabbed me more cream after my 3rd cup of coffee without me asking.   This place has become my new favorite in Vegas and will continue to return on any future trips. Wish I could give this place more stars."}
{"text":"Great place with a view of Strip, good food, excellent service! Sat on patio during happy hour, loved the hummus. My server, Ruth, was sweet and very personable. She kept refills coming on my iced tea on a very hot June day despite being quite busy. Was very happy with the value for the money on the food and the food quality was great. Was nice to be in a place I could just relax with a server who was kind and prompt. Nice job, Toms Urban!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, I had the Big Ass Egg Roll, and our server was wonderful. It was a small wait on a table which was okay. I collected my first social security check waiting on the food we ordered to arrive at the table and I was 49 when we sat down."}
{"text":"Update: manager refunded us for the burrito after we told them. Updated rating from 2 stars to 3.  Food: this has to be said upfront. We ordered the burrito, but unfortunately it came back cold. We told them and they took it back to \"remake\"- again cold. I think these are pre-made burritos because the outside was always hot but the inside always cold.. Like when you microwave a hot pocket! Also: carnitas sandwich had no shredded pork- purely ham.  Ambiance: urban eatery- just what you'd expect from the name :P  Price: overpriced for what you get. $17+ burgers; couple small plate items for $7-9. They're nothing unique in terms of their dishes (buffalo chicken sliders, Brussels sprouts, etc). Not to mention the poor quality control.  Service: they took back the burrito when we told them it was cold. But you'd think they'd check to make sure it didn't happen again..."}
{"text":"Waiter did not ask about burger doneness, so it came well done as a default. Ordered a chicken dish - waiter did not ask about side and just brought a random side- which was very good- but should ask what is wanted. Chicken was very good- $24 - so it should be. Regular fries come out instead of sweet potato fries. Burger ordered without cheese came with cheese- so that person did not get served at the same time because they had to redo.. So, overall there is a hiccup in the steps of ordering and serving what was ordered- which made the otherwise enjoyable dinner more administrative and instructive then it needs to be."}
{"text":"String parsley fries were stone cold and cooked poorly, I had their steak al carbon tacos and those were okay, cold too but somewhat tasty, my coworker has their philly cheese sandwich and that was super SALTY!"}
{"text":"All good things for me. I think this is a fun, hip, modern spot to have brunch or dinner on the NY NY Strip. Huge space inside along with a large outdoor patio and bar. Great place to hang with a group of friends. Has tons of televisions around to watch sports or have a laugh watching clips of funny/cute animal and kid videos (like I did).   The food was good. They have a variety of platters to choose from - wings, burgers, pizza, sliders, sandwiches, etc. All the fave American dishes! Average price range is $14+. My cousin ordered the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake. That was pretty tasty; each bite of the crispy chicken with cornbread was buttery and sweet. I had the campfire s'mores (wasn't hungry) and it was delicious! Enough to feed 4 people. I didn't have an issue with our service, thankfully."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent service & delicious food!!! Honey BBQ wings are great (coleslaw with it was  too) & the Philly French dip sandwich was REALLY good.  Our waitress Maha was OUTSTANDING!! One of the best servers I've ever had! She was awesome with our 2 year old too & so sweet service & food was so great, this will be our go- to spot in Vegas every year. We'll definitely go back again on this visit too."}
{"text":"Terrible food. The menu items look great on paper but are bland and very off tasting in real life. I got the lobster tacos - rubbery taco, bland insides, had to layer on the hot sauce. Cold side of fries. My daughter got the \"caramel butter\" French toast - the \"butter\" tasted like a glob of lard - definitely not butter. Not sure what is going on here. We guessed this place is better for its bar."}
{"text":"The food was good, but nothing to write home about, and overpriced for what you get. My kids devoured all of their kids' meais, and really enjoyed the kids' menus. The location on the Strip is nice and gives a good view of the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The service, however, was lousy. Our waiter was friendly, but not at all attentive. When I ordered my cocktail, I also asked for a glass of water. It never showed up, and no one refilled my wife's water glass. We had to remind our server about one of the entrees that probably would not have showed up had we not asked. At one point, our server came by to do the \"How is everything?\" but he failed to slow down, stop, make eye contact, or give us an opportunity to say anything in response. That was rude. I can tell he felt really busy, but I don't think he should have been. The place was NOT busy. We were sitting on the patio, where about half the tables were occupied, but inside, only about 10% of the tables were occupied. Not going back."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of these, but if I'm back in Vegas, this will definitely be on my visit again list. Stayed at New York New York, found this the night before we left. Drinks were absolutely amazing, Berin, our server was right on top of things all night, even as it got busy. Loved the service and food so much we came back to recover the next morning :)"}
{"text":"Great brunch and breakfast options without the buffet wait. Skillets, omelets, pancakes, Benedict's and more. Atmosphere is casual with many TV's and 80's music."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food and very slow service. The only redeeming quality here is the ambiance. My husband and I came here for breakfast because it was close to our hotel. We were seated right away but it took over 40 mins to receive our food after ordering. The waiter brought me my coffee but didn't bring me any cream or sugar, my breakfast burrito was dry and lacking flavor, and my husband's steak was overcooked. Our waiter was very unenthused and seemed out of it. Definitely won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"First time at Tom Urban and food was just ok. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. No complaints on the service. The place was empty and we did get our food fast. The drinks were just ok. I ordered an Old Fashion and it was watered down and the other drink a Mexican Mule was too sweet. I ordered the Carnitas Cuban Sandwich. The sandwich was more like a ham sandwich. Carnitas to me means fried chunks of pork not a slice of ham. The other entree we got was the chimicheree steak which was ok. Not much flavor to it but the the meat was soft. We were too hungry to complain and ask for something else so we just went with it."}
{"text":"We tried to have lunch here.  Waited for over 15 minutes, no service and the place was half empty.  Tom C if you or your people monitor YELP you should be embarrassed...."}
{"text":"We stop in here for dinner prior to Vegas Golden Knights home games. Great food, outstanding beer selection, friendly servers!!!"}
{"text":"i've had better food and service in my previous visit not sure if there short of staff or if their just overwhelmed the large amount of customers either way ive had better"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is a long wait. I mean it took more than 20 min to get the check cashed out...."}
{"text":"Keep walking.. $23 sandwich and stand in line for 1 toilet! Waitress is either hung over or hates her job! If you're going to pay this much at least have decent restrooms! I used the men's restroom because a line for women's. The staff told me to go to Casino and use the bathrooms there. Do Not Come Here!"}
{"text":"Great experience, GREAT service!!  Philadelphia cheese steak is a giant beef sandwich   Definitely share unless you're starving!  Garlic fries are outstanding!! Paulina was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Got the filet mignon benedict. This was mediocre at best. Food was lukewarm. Hash brown had a cheesy topping, mostly mushy, without the crispness. The medallions was chewy... And the muffin it was on tasted like it was from the grocery store.   The egg was done nicely though."}
{"text":"We ate at Tom's Urban at New York New York. The service was slow and the menu overpriced. The food was average, nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Over cooked eggs Benedict. Disappointed in my experience. Got very excited for tree hugger eggs Benedict that I saw on Yelp. Server was pleasant enough. Hostess sat us against the back wall behind a rolling TV and many tables were open. She did move us one over when we asked. Food took a very long time to come out. There were under 20 people seated. As I stated before eggs were over cooked. Hollandaise was minimal not very tasty. English muffin was too dry to eat as eggs didn't run and lack of sauce. Best part was the \"hash brown \" which is really shredded potato in a pan with melted cheese. Not very warm. Server didn't ask questions when the eggs and muffin were left on my plate and I said \"I'm done with what I can eat\". She did ask if we needed anything but it was before I had tried my eggs. Needless to say we won't be back. Oh yea there were a few black flies and a few birds."}
{"text":"What a shame that the staff has to be SO snotty because it has the potential to be a fun place with good food but I can't take the SNOTTY girls at the hostess stand or the manager.  About a month ago the waitress was awesome, was being glared down by her mgr (female) and made us feel uncomfortable and sorry for her.  Last night we were late for a reservation but NO attempt to help us was provided but a SNOTTY 'sorry'.  We thought we'd go to the bar and decide what our next plan would be. Instead, we were 'chased' to the door, stopped (rudely) and (in my face) was told that if we wanted to go the bar to try and order food it was be 45 minutes!!  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know I couldn't go in and have a drink!!    SEEEE YAAA   FOR GOOD THIS TIME!  Not sure why you think you're better than everyone but I'm \"OUT\" and all my friends at work will be as well."}
{"text":"The service was great and the atmosphere is very nice.  However, my breakfast was so-so.  The Beach Bum omelet was tasty, but the hash browns and toast were so hard!  I managed to crunch through a couple of pieces of toast, but I could only handle a half bite of the hash browns.  This place isn't cheap, so I expected better."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service is 5 star. The food wasn't as good as I expected.   Sat at the bar that was closest to the boulevard. No problem getting a seat or being waited on. There was another large bar on the opposite side too. The  sandwiches come with a choice of either garlic or sweet potato fries. I ordered the Cuban (without onions) with sweet potato fries and my husband ordered the prime rib philly with sweet potato fries. Both of our fries were only Luke warm. Hubby liked his sandwich but didn't care for the juice to dip it in. It was thick like a gravy. I did not care for mine at all. It barely had any pork on it and a excessive amount of mustard that overpowered everything. It also had onions on it that I picked off & didn't say anything. The bartender noticed all the onions on my plate and he offered me a cocktail because they screwed up. I thought that was pretty nice of him. Usually people just pick up your plate and say nothing. We'd go back again for drinks but probably skip the food."}
{"text":"Wow!  What great service and food!  Vegan?  No problem.  Compliments to Chef Hancock who graciously prepared a glorious, delicious vegan pizza (off the menu).  I would go on and on about how delicious it was (spinach, portobello mushrooms... The list goes on) BUT, talk about a place that celebrates humanity, hospitality and the enjoyment of life... Best in Vegas!  Thanks Michael and Hancock!  Perfect end to a perfect evening."}
{"text":"I'm a local. The food was good but the service was horrible! First the frozen machines wasn't on so we couldn't get anything frozen. Second I had to send my drink back and requested a raspberry martini  the waitress came back with a peach martini and asked if I can do a peach martini because they were out of raspberries. chick that's like ordering fish tacos and coming out with steak tacos because your out of fish. She was rude and horrible!"}
{"text":"Meh. Figgy Piggy was decent but hashbrowns were cold.  Anything covered in cheese should come out hot."}
{"text":"The Chimichurri Steak was overcooked while the meat was very chewy and lacked flavor. The sides were bland and the service was poor. Our server disappeared after the food finally came out and did not come back to check on us. The pineapple upside down cake was tasty but I cannot recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"So I went to Tom's Urban last night for the first time and was seated out on the patio. Our server said her name was Michele (with one L lol) and she was fantastic. Great energy from her, nothing but polite, knowledgeable and fast working. Service throughout the place was top notch and the food was amazing. Those duck wings were so tender and juicy, probably the best I've had. All in all, fantastic experience. Thanks everyone at Tom's for giving us a great dining experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday night and the place was quiet. Sat at the bar and service was great! Menu's a bit convoluted, \"where're the dinner entrees, is this breakfast only, small plate versus appetizer etc etc.\"  I went with two small plates -- carnitas mac and bbq duck legs. Both were great!! ...but I was still hungry.  Between the two small plates and two ipa drafts I rang up a $45 tab.  Draft beer options were impressive (30+ on tap). Docked a star for pricey-ness. To sum it up -- great gasto pub food at inflated prices. I'd imagine  a dinner for two would run $100+ I'd happily go back!"}
{"text":"Drinks, duck wings, chopped salad, & shrimp avocado salad were good. Shrimp avocado needed more shrimp! Friendly and good service, kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Monte Carlo so decided to try Toms again and like the last time the food was awesome and the service was just as good. This time I had the mac and cheese and the burger sliders. Best mac and cheese I ever had. Next time I think I'm going to try the tacos. Kudos to you guys!"}
{"text":"Despite some rocky service and so-so food, I'm bumping this place up a star because I can see a lot of happy hour potential and I had one of the best mixed drinks ever!  I met a friend here for dinner and we were initially seated on the patio, but after no one acknowledged us within 15 minutes, we decided to move inside. Good thing we did, because we were promptly served and our waiter (Berin?) was fantastic.  My friend is vegetarian, which is part of the reason I selected Tom's Urban. They have a large vegetarian menu along with plenty of food for meat eaters like me. But we both stuck with the veggies, splitting spicy edamame ($6.50), a small kale Caesar salad ($4.50), a hummus duo ($9), and roasted Brussels sprouts ($6.50 on the menu, but free with a Yelp check-in!). Not a fan of the edamame, which was WAY too salty, and the salad and Brussels sprouts were pretty pedestrian. But the hummus duo was really flavorful and came with carrots and celery as well as pita chips, which was great for a low-carb eater like myself.  My friend nursed a pint of Stella Artois ($9.50), but I was Ubering home and decided to sample a few of their $14.50 mixed drinks. Started with a Mule Kick, which is basically a Moscow Mule, and ended with two Tai Chi Chai Teas, which I can only describe as Christmas in July. (Yeah, I know it's November as I write this...) This drink would be perfect on the patio on a hot Vegas day: a spicy mix of coconut water rum, lime juice, ginger, and bitters that's allegedly only 110 calories. Two was not enough, but my budget couldn't afford more. Just wish I had skipped the Mule and started with the Tea!  We were there on the weekend, so we didn't get to experience their progressive happy hour, but next time I'm in the area, I'll be back. Drink and food specials are from 4 to 7, and the prices rise every hour. I'm not sure if that Tai Chi Chai Tea is on the menu, but I could definitely do some damage if that's the case--and, if not, it's worth paying full price for that tasty concoction!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink. Good vibes and atmosphere. Eddie was our server and took care of us in a timely matter. We will most definitely come back to visit when we are back in LV."}
{"text":"Great service and food!!! I would recommend while in Vegas, go visit! Portion sizes and taste was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place...happy hour time-or they call it Beat the clock, no bueno!! It says not offered during arena events...the arena is like way behind the hotel. I would understand it's not offered if a band was playing on the bridge on Las Vegas Blvd....but come on...really?? The arena is like .5 a mile away..lol!!"}
{"text":"Great food & cold beer. What's not to love? The only thing I found was the overly loud music. Not a great place for deep conversation, but perfect for an awesome burger."}
{"text":"Went here before our show during happy hour special. Service was great and our waitress Paige was very helpful and made sure we were well taken care of. Food was very good. Have no complaints."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. The food, the drinks, the environment, location, and staff were all great. Loved the music that was playing for morning brunch and a great people watching spot."}
{"text":"In need of a seat and a little bit of alcohol after perusing the strip for some time we decided to accomplish both of our needs at the outside bar at Tom's Urban.  Although our experience did not entail too much (we had a spiked shake and a couple beers) it was a very pleasant one.  The atmosphere here is pretty relaxed and the design and architecture kept the eyes busy.  The setup is actually quite ingenious to me as it flows very seamlessly from inside to outside.    The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The hostess working that day was able to answer our questions with a smile and the bartender was personable and efficient.   Not a bad place to stop in and get a couple drinks and from the looks of the food probably more.  It was unfortunate that we had already eaten."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. Server was awesome but food was  not great. Rather would have went somewhere else for the price."}
{"text":"Strolled in the other day and the food smelled great so we picked up some seats and were greeted by a one of the most down to earth servers named Nathan. He recommended the philly and I'm very glad he did! Every bite was more enjoyable than the last! Everything about this place was amazing. The atmosphere, location, food, service, and let's not forget about the beer selection either. 10/10 I highly recommend grabbing yourself a cheese steak soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before a show at New York New York just because of location. Thought it would be a simple American restaurant. Menu was large, but food was just okay. I had the Cuban sandwich and there was hardly any pork on it. I was looking forward to the garlic fries, but they had WAY too much garlic in them. My wife had the Lobster mac and cheese and said it tasted like it was made with Velveta.  Mojito was not the best (tasted watered down) and way overpriced for the amount of alcohol it contained. Too many other good places to eat rather than waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Pretty good (though expensive) food and great atmosphere outside. Our group got the hot wings, steak sliders, and avocado shrimp salad, which were all solid. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of 10 dressed up girls before we went out for a night of clubbing. Had one of the best restaurant experiences I've personally ever had, and it's shocking that it happened at a hotel like New York New York.  Service: 5/5: Our waitress was Ana, who was really nice, and provided really helpful service.  Staff is funny, chatty, friendly, and extremely helpful. They asked us about our day and tried to even make the most out of our trip.  Are here on a Wednesday, so he restaurant was a little slow, and the restaurant was clearly overstaffed, so we got a lot of attention. Upon asking why we were in Vegas, we informed them that Two of us had Birthdays. (One turning 22 and the other 23).  We were given 2 FREE rounds of shots: a raspberry lemon drop and a chocolate cake, and both were DELICIOUS! (That's a total of 20 free shots).   Food: 4.5/5 The pricing is pretty reasonable for Vegas. $15-25 per person. The food was pretty good too, and the portion sizes are fair. The shoestring garlic fries were delicious.  Another thing to know is this place is fairly vegetarian friendly (at least relative to the rest of Las Vegas.) The items were clearly labeled with a (v) icon."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.   1. Food was great, cheesy hashbrowns went great with my custom omlet 2. Service was with a great smile all around, greeter and servers took great care of us 3. Loved the patio and decor, nice modern place and everyone's plate I was eyeballing looked amazing.  Conveniently located just outside New York New York and great atmosphere. Highly recommend to anyone local or traveling!"}
{"text":"My first time here was in June 2016 and I thought they were the end all be all on my trip. I ate there 3 times in 5 days.   I had buffalo wings, pancakes, and shrimp and grits.   I went again in August of 2017, still good as last year.   It's so hot that they have sprinklers spewing a light mist on you to cool you off. HOWEVER, I'm a black woman with black hair and my hair doesn't do well WET! It is a nice gesture but they could at least have it in a timer to go off periodically NOT continuously. This didn't happen in 2016. The waitress said they couldn't turn it off because it's on a timer. So for that, I'm taking away a star."}
{"text":"I was able to immediately get a patio seat for breakfast, which was great.  I was stuck with either having the sun in my face or sitting in the chilly shade, but I also could've just worn warmer clothing.  The people watching outside New York New York was a nice way to pass the time.  I ordered the urban breakfast platter.  My sunny side up eggs were cooked well, though the bacon was quite oily and chewy.  The sourdough toast was a little light on the butter but had a great chew.  The standouts were the amazing asadero hash browns and the little cup of preserves for the toast.  I would definitely go back for the cheesy goodness of those potatoes, and the sweetness of the preserves was a perfect compliment to the salty toast, especially after it had been dipped in egg yolk.  It's probably partially because I was seated on the patio when it was very windy and chilly in the shade, but my only real complaint is that the temperature of my food was off.  The cheese was solidified on the hash browns, the toast has hardened into sharp rock-hard shards, and the bacon was not crispy.  Perhaps my food was waiting at the pass longer than it should have been?  Service was otherwise great, my water stayed filled, and my request for a new ketchup bottle was taken care of promptly.  I feel their prices are very reasonable considering their location, especially when compared to the prices many of the casino's cafes are charging."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my friend. We already had an early dinner, so we just wanted to have couple appetizers and enjoy the views from the patio. Our server Jeannie recommended the fillet mignon sliders (that was a great recommendation) and we also ordered the Brussel sprouts and the upside down cake.  The fillet mignon sliders were so juicy and almost melt in your mouth. The Brussel sprouts had a nice charred and a great caramelized flavor.   The dessert was not as much of a wow, but maybe because the appetizers so great that our expections got too nigh!!!    I would have given a 4 star review if it wasn't for the amazing job the staff did. Oh and the manager was also making sure that we had a great experience. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Allison and Adam were incredible tonight. As my experience is extremely lengthy ( being a bar manager) I could not find better customer service if I tried. Great individuals with the company mindset to succeed and grow. Cheers to these guys who made my last night as a single man absolutely incredible. Cheers to Allison and Adam, you have a truly amazing work ethic and it was a blast. Feel like I've known you for years after one conversation!"}
{"text":"Man, good reviews and the place looked nice but what a disappointment.   First the place was basically empty and yet they had a 20 min wait. No problem, I know how that works, I worked in a restaurant for years. Understaffed on a Sunday morning NBD. Then we get seated at the bar, cool we're in Vegas and I'm gonna want an Irish coffee, sounds great to me! The bar tender has the whole area to himself but there weren't that many people there so I figured it shouldn't be too bad but I guess I was wrong.   We ordered two waters and two Irish coffees. He forgot the waters but serves the Irish coffees. I try to get his attention but it was near impossible. Maybe this guy was new? I'm not sure but he took forever to do everything. It was taking about 10 minutes to get his attention and I really needed some water before diving into my Irish coffee since I had a slight headache (probably from being dehydrated) so I leave the bar and walk to the deli to buy a bottle of water.   Then it took at least another 10 minutes to get our order taken and he was putting the order in right in front of us as we were telling him our order. After 35 minutes of waiting for our food we realized it's probably not a back up in the kitchen that's taking it so long... so we ask the bar tender (again, took forever to get his attention) to check on our food. He comes back and doesn't even say anything to us first but looks in the computer. Ya know... I was a server before, I know the \"oh shit I didn't put it in\" look and that's ok, that stuff happens. But that only happened when I was hammered with too many tables which this guy did not have.   By this point I was done with this bartender whom I had so much patience with up until that point. While waiting for our food another table had sat down and was ignored so long that they got up and left. Another table also sat down and while the bartender started to put their order into the computer they left too. It was just so bizarre that he didn't have that many tables and he didn't have that many drink orders to make for the rest of the restaurant yet everything was taking forever and he didn't seem to be in a rush at all. His demeanor was very sluggish for a bartender.   Anyway after looking in the computer he looks up at us and says \"I don't know what happened but the kitchen doesn't have the ticket, can you tell me your order again.\" So either he forgot to press \"send order\" or the kitchen dropped the ticket somewhere. Either way, at that point of waiting approximately 40 minutes for food the manager needs to get involved and something should be given up, free app or like 10% off the bill. Doesn't matter what it is as long as SOMETHING is given. This guy doesn't even think to ask and that's when I realized he's just naturally bad at this job.   I would have asked for a manager but we were so hungry that we were fed up and didn't want to wait any longer. I asked for the bill and for two Irish coffee's it was $22. WHAT A RIP OFF.   We went to a crepe place right across from them and had food within 3 minutes and it was DELICIOUS.   The next time we're in Vegas I think we'll try this place again, but we definitely won't sit at the bar. I hate to judge a place after only one visit, and we didn't even try the food, so we'll be back. Hopefully the second time will be much better!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, we would like to thank Eddie our Server.  A must try! Burgers are the best. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome beer selection. The largest beer size they serve is 40oz. The 40oz is served in a cool two handed beer mug. Food was great. I came in with a party of 8 and was impressed with how attentive they were with our group. Eric and Jonathan made sure we were taken care of. I ordered the cheese burger sliders and thought they were perfectly prepared. Our food came out hot and fresh. The meat on my sliders were juicy and flavorful. I suggest you save room for dessert. Their brownie cookies and smores dessert was amazing! And it was large enough to share with the table."}
{"text":"I just want to take the time to give my server Eddie 10/10! He was very helpful with the menu items. It was me with  about 7 others and even for us being \"annoying\" he was still patient with us. All of our food was amazing we got the sliders & pizza with some starters. I would come back again just to have Eddie as my server again. Thank you for the amazing service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Vast menu which is good if you're with a group since it's easier to please everyone. They also have a nice drink menu (alcoholic and non alcoholic). Stopped here on the way to a concert at the T-Mobile arena. It was a fun place to people watch, eat some great garlic fries, and sip on a bloody Mary before the show started. Pricey but really what place on the strip isn't? I don't go to the strip often but when family and friends visit we'll stop in."}
{"text":"My wife and I were trying to find Shake Shack and saw a pretty long line. She proposed we try Tom's instead because they were right next door and also had tables on the patio facing the strip. What a pleasant happenstance. Our server Nate was awesome, and recommended the philly sandwich. Just a warning, this is a huge chunk of meat. It had a melty Havarti Cheese and a beef demi glaze to dip it in. My wife ordered the pull pork sandwhich soaked in a tasty bbq sauce and topped with their homemade coleslaw, like every pull pork should be! For being a new restaurant, these guys got it going on! A+ for food quality and service."}
{"text":"Kind staff and delicious food. They have happy hour starting at 4. Ordered mai tai and it was delicious. Ordered the edamame, rosemary lemon tater tots, pot stickers and taco. All apps are 4$ prices goes up w/ the hour"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports. Has big menu to choose from and lots of different cocktails. TVs all over."}
{"text":"Wow! So many options and what a great addition to the NYNY! Easy peasy access , cool strip patio and all new Vegas .  The food is plentiful and there are so many options it's almost hard to concentrate ! We took the homemade pop tart to go , cherry , and it was so flakey but not to sweet.  Great snack and early morning breakfast! Service was cool and Dani the manager was more than accommodating ! My in town family who never go to the strip even loved it!! I will always make the time to visit !"}
{"text":"This place replaced ESPN sports. The music videos and sport channels were decent but  they were out of Fanta Orange soda and two other items we wanted. We were also told that we could watch the Knicks basketball game before we came in but the manager told us he could not get it. NBA League Pass?? NOT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out since the reviews looked good, really nice outside area, right on the strip. Wish we had sat the bar though, service was slow and didn't improve much.  Other than that, the menu was great, a lot of great options. I went with a house margarita, was pretty good. For food I got the Almost Chicago Dog, it was massive. Lots of toppings and the dog was thick and juicy, no homo. Fries were good too, thin style, a tad undercooked, but didn't stop me from eating them. Had a few beers, selection was pretty decent.  I'd recommend stopping in if you're in Vegas for the first time."}
{"text":"We came here thinking it would be bomb. However, as soon as they were lucky enough to received the arrival of the The Molde's you got two hostess standing there no greet, no nothing, my husband had to yell at the hostess to get some attention. We got seated at a dirty ass table, and when I say dirty I mean, the seats had stains on them, the benches were full of spill marks and barf. We sat down and we realized we're too good for this dirty ass place. And walked the hell on out. Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Cool looking place but we went in around 10pm, Wasn't busy at all. It took a while for anyone to acknowledge us. When we were finally seated she handed us some menus and that was the last time we saw anyone from the restaurant. Waited 15-20 for someone to at least tell us they would be with us shortly but they never came so we left."}
{"text":"I gave Tom's Urban another chance and boy am I happy I did!! Not only was the service excellent this time but the food was to die for! I had lobster and shrimp tacos and lobster and shrimp Mac n cheese. Beautifully plated, perfectly spiced and the portions were huge. I was lucky enough to bring some back for a late night snack.  Shoutout to Rebecca my server and John the manager. A perfect dinner before the show!! Also John informed me that they are opening a Tom's Urban in a casino in Washington!! Next time I am at the Iliana I will be bringing my family to Tom's!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Food was good and atmosphere even better  can't say enough about sever Bo."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is next door to the NYNY hotel on the Strip. It was early enough for breakfast but after checking out the menu my wife and I decided on a delicious shrimp, spinach, and avocado salad and filet mignon sliders; not exactly bacon and eggs but the menu is so diverse and fun we were inspired to expand the breakfast horizon. I recommend everything about this restaurant, from the strip-people-watching on the patio, to the helpful and friendly service from the staff, to the quality of the food. It's not really a restaurant that is going to show up on Zagat, but it is high quality, clean, very well done with a successful system for service and quality food. Very relaxed easy vibe and inviting. Go there. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast since it was opened at 6:30am.  The kids enjoyed it and the food was good. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was that they don't offer free refills.  You can get charged $12 for an iced tea if you have two glass.  The kids liked the pop tart $6.95 and pancake (ask for kid's size).  It comes with one pancake instead of three for $6.95, where as the three is $11.95.    I had the traditional eggs with bacon, toast and home fries.  The kids ate all my home fries.  Tip:  Remember to ask what the favor of the pop tart is before ordering since it changes daily.    Also, if you are not fond of the sun shinning directly into your eyes, make sure you ask for a shaded area.  We were there when the sun was upcoming up on the east and my son could barely keep his eyes open since the sun was shining right at him."}
{"text":"Nothing really spectacular. We came here because it was in our hotel and way too hot out to walk around. I ordered the breakfast burrito with bacon. It's huge. But lacking. The bacon is crispy little bits hardly satisfying and the egg looked like it was precooked and then tossed in. It wasn't hot when it came out. I only ate about a third of it before I couldn't stomach anymore. My husband ordered the breakfast Cubano. Also very big and much better than my choice.  The pop tart was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to come here, the prices are a bit high ($14 for 6 chicken wings) but considering we're in Vegas, there aren't many cheaper options.   The tacos are great because you can mix & match, I chose a Bahn Mi, Vindaloo, and Adobo chicken. The Bahn Mi tacos are to die for!!! I wish I would've just ordered 3 of them. The other two were fine, just couldn't beat the Bahn Mi. Yum!   My SO said his burger was perfect and it filled him up itself, but he ate all of the fries anyways because they were amazing.  Location is perfect, I don't think there is a bad seat in the entire restaurant and the atmosphere is perfect for brunch or an early lunch. The specials are pretty good too in the evening.  Would've given 5 stars, but it's a bit pricey ($8.5 for a Budweiser...) and our waitress took quite a while to acknowledge us (it was a busy Friday though)."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday night at 6pm for dinner. Atmosphere was upscale sports bar. They had TV's with music videos playing which I liked. Food was really good, we had the buffalo chicken sliders, the mac n cheese pot and the BBQ pork sandwich. They advertise happy hour here, but weren't offering it because there was a concert at the T-Mobile arena. Dumb. Waitress wasn't super friendly, come here for the food, reasonable price for Vegas."}
{"text":"The French fries two ways and crispy brussel sprouts are amazing! Good selection of beers on draft. Frankie was our bartender. He was friendly and did a fantastic job. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast after a long night of boozing to grab a bite and keep the party going. Sat out on the patio area. They have plenty of fans and misters to keep you cool. Great area on strip for people watching. JoAnn our server was awesome. She made several recommendations and even questioned my manhood when I ordered a regular sized beer so I manned up and a red bull vodka to show her. Haha! I ordered a few more after too. She was super cool. I stopped by a week later but didn't run into her.  The food is great. I ordered an egg white omelette and they brought me a regular one but they fixed it. Took a while but manager came by and told me my meal was on the house. Sweet! I still had to pay for drinks but I was like nothing beats free. I ordered a kale salad with it as well; just cutting carbs. I did share the house made pop tart which was off the hook.  After a long fun day at the pool I brought my friends here for dinner. Sat on the patio on the strip. That was very entertaining bc of all the debauchery happening. It's Vegas so it's a normal Friday night. All of the food was delicious.  Stopped by on my 3rd morning and ate at bar area. Laurie took care of me. She was awesome! She knows her golf courses in the area and gave me a bunch of recommendations for my golf trip the following week. Funny thing happened again when I ordered the egg white omelette. They brought me a regular one. They fixed it but I payed for it this time. It was 8am and some guy was doing shots at the bar. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and the food was great. Best part was the service. I stopped by again a week later to see Laurie but she was off. I had a great time golfing. Thanks, Laurie. P.S. Badlands was brutal."}
{"text":"This place is so inconsistent. We had four two-for-one 33 oz beer specials, so we went there two different days. The first day, they gave us four 22 oz beers for free instead of giving us four 33 oz beers and making us pay for two. The second day, they told us that they weren't sure how the coupons worked, but that they would figure it out and make it work. Then, halfway through drinking our beers, they said the coupons don't work, but that they would give us one beer for free. Really, we only had to pay for one extra beer, but it was frustrating that they told us that we could use it and then told us we couldn't after we had already ordered. Service was also very slow, despite that only a quarter of the bar was full. They also had to comp an entire table near us because of bad service."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here this evening. Was promptly greeted by hostess with a smile and shown to our seats. Miranda was our server and couldn't have been more amazing! She was so great, very attentive, and so kind to our 4 year old daughter. The food was amazing. I had the lobster roll which wasn't overly slathered in mayo, it was full of huge lobster chunks and perfect. My hubby had the prime rib French dip sandwich (simply delicious). My daughter had the pancake which was huge, ask for the kids portion and they will give you two pancakes at a discounted price. My daughter is very picky about her food and she loved the pancake, also ate almost all of my garlic French fries that came with the lobster roll. The food was amazing, but the staff made the whole experience spectacular! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant inside New York New York Casino in Vegas ist excellent. We were staying next door at MGM Park & had a couple meals there because the food was delicious! I would definitely recommend it & revisit whenever we're back in the area!"}
{"text":"It was VGK Game night so we checked it. Food was very sub par and prices high. Service was so so. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Located on the strip, I was looking to eat at a place that would cure my hangover. I saw on their menu toms hangover plate. It was chili on top of a burger. It was good but also disgusting at the same time. The chili was cold but the burger was cooked nicely. It was weird. It came with fried eggs on top and one of the eggs had no runny yolk (too fried). Service was okay. It should've been better considering there was not a lot of people."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast  I had the breakfast burrito with carnitas, and my hubby had the urban platter. He really enjoyed the homemade pop tart. I would go back to try another meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beer selection and service. We had beef nachos and a burger and it was the best meal we've had all vacation. We love how it has such a 'Denver' vibe, made us feel that much closer to home :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for being Vegas! I was able to get a good salad after eating like crap all weekend! My son had the Lobster Mac&Cheese, so good!! We ordered a few other things, everything was delish"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant from outside. Stopped here for dinner. The ambiance is very interesting, it has a beautifully designed and cozy patio. But then I saw that the tables and chairs were dirty, which was a great disappointment for me. What a great mistake. However..... We decided to give it a try.  The service was very slow. We had to wait about 15 minutes before the server approached us to take our order and it took almost an hour for our food to arrive. The food was OK but not worth what we paid for. They never refilled our drinks.   Overall, very pricey for average food and BAD service."}
{"text":"The food here is so unique and delicious!  I ordered the Filet Mignon Steak Sliders (which were amazing) and the French Fries Two Ways (a must-have!).  The filet mignon was so tender that it literally broke apart as you bit into the slider.  The butter-toasted brioche buns and the unique hollandaise sauce enhanced the flavor of this dish.  YOU HAVE TO GET THE FRENCH FRIES TWO WAYS because you need to try both of the fries they offer here.  They are so different, yet equally delectable.  It also comes with two different kinds of ketchup (Moroccan and Caribbean) that compliment their respective fries perfectly.  My friends tried the Big Ass Egg Roll and the Steak Burrito.  Both of them were pretty good.  The Big Ass Egg Roll is basically a huge deep fried burrito, which would get tiring to eat after awhile unless you love fried foods.  I had two cocktails: the Ultimate Peach Cosmo and the Skyy High Roller. The Ultimat Peach Cosmo is a little sweet, but was still delicious.  I loved both of them and would recommend them.  The service could use a bit of work, but I think it is just because they recently opened and are still working on the kinks.  I would definitely return here again, especially to try out the outdoor patio bar area when the weather gets warmer!"}
{"text":"We hit happy hour....the food was amazing and they give the same size portions at happy hour that they do at regular time.  Drink was very good!  Service was awesome too.  Definitely hitting this place up when we go back!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the happy hour upsell!  Happy hour urban marg -$7 \"Medium\" urban marg - $23.50   The server won't be up front about the difference here, but better to get 3 smaller drinks for less than a medium. Same with beer, didn't offer the \"happy hour\" size despite our menus being open to that page he asked \"22 oz or 40 oz?\".   The only reason for two stars is for the bartender, who attempted to correct the server's misleading ways."}
{"text":"Food was decent and reasonable prices. We had the buttermilk pancakes and breakfast burrito- burrito was a bit difficult to eat, but good had good flavor and was good.  The hostess was rude to us and another group she was seating. The waitress seem to be in a hurry to get us to leave and it wasn't even busy. We did not feel comfortable taking our time to eat.  Overall food was good, but service not so much."}
{"text":"Came in at 1pm on Monday  (today). Waited forever to be served. The patio heaters were not on and it was freezing so we asked to be moved inside, took 3 times to ask them and finally they moved us. Waited 45 mins for cold stale fries, gross soup and tater tots. And they were slow! Also had attitude coming off of staff. Disappointed I wasted time here. Also I am watching a lady try to find someone so she can pay. Plenty of slacking staff and not busy..."}
{"text":"Jennifer and Corine are the BEST EVER...first of all, they are f'n gorgeous, secondly, hospitality is above all others. This place not only rocks the best of 80's music, the best, the servers are phenomenal...hey Bear, Jennifer and Korine!!! Come here...every Las Vegas vaca should experience Tom's Urban!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were searching for a place to eat after a long day of traveling and we stumbles upon this gem. We were starving, but we wanted to eat something light for the day clubs in Vegas, so this place was the perfect place. They had some great selections of salads that were HUGE. It filled us up and was so flavorful. I got the cob salad. It was filled with great ingredients. It had cabbage, blue cheese, bacon bits, avocado, corn and so much more. It didn't even need a lot of the salad dressing because it was so flavorful.  My sister got a salmon salad and this was soooo good. It was on a bed of cabbage and the dressing was slightly spicy.  The server was very friendly and made sure she took care of us.  They had a really delicious breakfast menu too. I wanted to come for breakfast, but never found the time to come back. I wanted to try their breakfast pop tarts.  A very good option if you're starving in Vegas. It is pretty pricey though, but I feel like everything on the strip is around that price. So you should come check it out!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time, for lunch today and woah! The burger craving that I DIDN'T even know that I had... was cured.   It didn't start with the burger though... first we had an order of the chicken pot stickers as a starter. Pretty dang good. The dipping sauce served with it was great - not too sweet, not to spicy...it was kind of syrup-y but not in a bad way! The chicken in the potsticker had a nice flavor to it that thr sauce really compliments.  The burger... I had not had a burger with a fried egg as a topping, not before, not ever. After hearing my boss rave about the Korean burger, I instantly found myself searching for a burger, in general. The server (very polite and attentive) recommended the Sin City burger so I went with it. It looked good when it was brought to my table and I noticed that it was something that I wanted to finish, but might not make it (large burger) ha! I did get my burger sans bacon and onions, and I'm now regretting omitting the bacon. I had been worried about the bbq sauce conflicting with the egg... but I wanted to try it as it was (as much as I could do, diet wise) so I left it and holy bbq! It went so well! The bbq especially complimented the grill produced crunch that the burger had around the outside. I think I've found my new favorite specialty burger :)"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! Starving at 6 AM and couldn't find another breakfast place near us that was open. Total life safer! Big dinning area and lots of options to choose from. I know it was only 6 but I decided to start off with the big ass beer. Got the engine running the right way. The Brussels sprouts were sautéed very nicely and the cubano sandwich was awesome!! Very huge and hardy. The bahn mi tacos were good but I would suggest having lettuce wrap as the option instead of tortillas"}
{"text":"While the location is nice, right on the strip, the food and service is lacking. I ordered the margarita pizza which was under cooked pizza dough with sauce and a cheese stick. It was served cold. Tim the waiter almost got tomato sauce on his arm when he reached in front of me to refill my water glass. But if you want a overpriced drink on the strip This is the place to go"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban was exactly what I needed. I wanted a fun atmosphere with great food and drinks and that's what I got. I had the ribs which were pretty amazing. Very tender a slathered with an awesome bbq sauce. The atmosphere was cool yet casual. A great place to socialize.  The service was attentive and very helpful wth recommendations.  I would absolutely come here again.  They have so many items that I'm excited to try."}
{"text":"The service was cool until we got out food.. Ordered the Al Carbon nachos.. We waited almost 30 minutes for nachos.. When they get here.. Nachos are microwaved over.. Over microwaved.. Overcooked.. It didnt even look appetizing... We out! Popeyes here we come!"}
{"text":"We went here later at night (10 pm) when visiting the New York New York.  Pros:  They sat us in our own quiet corner,  Cons: Service was poor, our waitress was not good about checking on us.  I had the steamed bun sliders - it was not what I had expected.. (its a combo of a steamed bun and a slider) ..  My boyfriend had the black bean burger. It was huge, but had poor texture (was falling apart and dry).  We ordered sweet potato fries but got regular fries. Once we got the waitress's attention she did bring us the right ones. They were both good.  The adult shake was quite good, and it would be the only thing I would go back for.  Not our best meal in vegas.  Decor was fun.. I wonder if we had sat in the bar, while loud, it seemed to have better service.  They had a happy hour that would start in an hour, perhaps we caught them at the lull of the night before the late night crowd came in."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Cubano sandwhich was terrific. Highly recommend. The pop tart was served cold."}
{"text":"Im prepping for a bodybuilding show, so i had to eat pretty simple, but a lot of the things on the menu (i couldnt have) all looked amazing, especially the burgers! That being said, my roasted chicken and kale was pretty good and I would definitely eat here frequently while not on a prep diet! Nice ambience and service as well. No wait"}
{"text":"Ok came here Mayweather fight weekend so I'm a little late writing my review, let me first say we had the best waiter ever.  I don't know how I forgot his name, I'm bad with it don't judge me LOL.  But, anyway he was very tentative to our needs he recommended several things that we ended up trying, the Green Chile Smothered burrito, Shrimp & grits, Urban Chopped Salad & There Famous Mac & Cheese.  Everything was sooooooo good, well worth the money.  I'm going back to Las Vegas this weekend for my birthday so I for sure will be returning here on my visit."}
{"text":"OK. So we came here because my friend and I were in the area because we wanted to see Zumanity. I got the tom's butcher steak. now it didn't really label what kind of cut it was but they stated it was a butcher cut so I said what the heck.  Come to find out it was a shoulder cut. Not really what I was expecting but it looked good. The chef properly prepared it. It was cooked to a rare and cut on a bias. Unfortunately there was not enough salt on the steak to taste good but there was pink sea salt shaker on the tablet which provided a mild salty taste. The steak was beautifully cooked. The salad was nothing to write home about. It was a blue cheese salad with baby romaine lettuce that complimented the steak well. the bread that the steak was sitting on was so delicious. Usually I don't eat those thingsbut somehow they made it taste good.  Now I got garlic fries and these are pretty good. I have to admit that the garlic taste was very splotchy. Some of the fries had a parm taste. Some had a garlic taste. some had both and some had none? but overall it tasted phenomenally.  I probably would have gone for the nyny strip next time because I could choose my side, but  this was nothing bad. The environment was nice and urban/beachy. awesome 80s\90s music was playing in the background with music videos. Totally would go here again."}
{"text":"Must visit !!!! Great food, cocktails, and staff!!We love the lobster and shrimp Mac n cheese, the shrimp po boy sliders, or the steak nachos. All breakfast items are also on point!! Great location to look out onto Las Vegas Blvd too!! Check it out"}
{"text":"After seeing long brunch lines farther north on The Strip, I eventually walked far enough to see this place.  I was just looking for a place that I could sit immediately, fortunately, it turned out to be a good spot.    I had the Beach Bum Omelet, it was quite good.  It needed salt, but the server brought some once I requested it.  I was sitting at the bar, not a table.  The coffee was fine, nothing special.  Hash browns and sourdough toast come with my omelet.  They were both fine, nothing special.  It took almost 30 minutes for my food to come out, wasn't particularly busy, so I don't really know what's up with that.  I liked the atmosphere, it didn't feel so much Vegas and felt more like a \"normal\" gastropub in another big city.  The service was good, especially to be at a bar setting at 11am.  I thought the price was actually fairly reasonable considering the location!"}
{"text":"We were in the NY NY Casino around dinner time and saw Tom's Urban. I looked at the menu and saw they had Frog Legs and Grits, whoa, I'm in. My plate was mounded with legs and, if I had been staying at a hotel with a fridge, I would have asked for a to go box. As it was I forced my self, lol, to eat them all. We will be back on our next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"We tried several different small plates and loved them all.  You must try the duck wings and the brussel sprouts... Amazing!    Great view of the strip from the patio."}
{"text":"Came here for some late nite drinks at the bar. Amanda was the best bartender! The drinks were good and the atmosphere was amazing for some late nite hang out. We want to come here and try some food next time!"}
{"text":"This was a decent option, nothing special but it was the only place that was opened for breakfast in the area so thumbs up for that.  I was in Vegas for a convention and I like to eat....a lot so I wanted breakfast.  After calling around and staying at the Tropicana, this was the only place open.  We went and it was fine.  We were the only ones there and the food took a little longer than expected which made us laugh.  We probably were the only ones in vegas up at that time.  I have no complaints about the omelet it was great, but the potatoes were covered in cheese.  While most people wouldn't complain, I couldn't handle that so early.  It was a nice spot for a quiet breakfast, don't expect anything special but it was decent."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and Amazing food as long as you get pass the host stand. I have been wanting to go to Toms since I first heard about it. Finally on New Years Day around 4:55pm we went. I didn't have a reservation so the host told me that she couldn't even tell me a quote time. An hour? Two Hours? Nope. So we walked away. Lucky for the Internet, I logged on Open Tables and made a reservation for 5:15pm! You should have seen the surprised look on the face of both \"hosts\" when my infinite wait time suddenly turned into 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"It's an amazing restaurant but mainly because Emanuel our waiter was amazing !!! From the beginning to the end!  Thank you for providing us this amazing service and if we come back to Vegas ! No when we come back we will be back ! Food was amazing but the food isn't nothing if the service isn't and it was ! Definitely would recommend anyone staying at vegas to swing by and come enjoy your food and drinks here !"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Tom's Urban in general. I was first exposed via a Yelp event in Los Angeles and I was glad to see Tom's Urban at New York New York!   My must-order Tom's Urban menu item is the Figgy Piggy (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, brie, havarti, Croatian fig jam on grilled sourdough). It's a grilled cheese with jam and bacon basically. The balance of flavors are perfect with the savory cheese and bacon and sweet jam. Delicious.   We also ordered: *fried pickles: tasty, but even better because they were free with a Yelp check-in!  *urban chopped salad (Baby kale, romaine, cabbage, avocado, bacon, ham, grilled chicken, edamame, cucumbers, tomatoes, goat cheese, green chile ranch, rosemary flatbread) - such a big portion! It was full of great ingredients & it was super tasty. I enjoyed the rosemary flatbread as well.   121/365"}
{"text":"There is just way too much going on here. Massive restaurant with multiple seating areas (yet spotty service) and a gigantic menu that spans several cuisines- none of them particularly strong. This may be a decent-enough option for all-hours dining on the Strip, but as a local, it's not a place I'll seek out to revisit.  The killer shrimp and grits dish I experienced at a Yelp event fell flat when I came back and received a bland, boring version with cold, flavorless shrimp. The duck wings are a delight, but the regular wings were dry and unappetizing. The prime rib philly was the only version of prime rib I've ever seen my guy refuse to take more than a few bites of: it was overly salty, tough, and generally not appealing. The drinks were okay, they just took our entire meal to get.  All in all, I'm not impressed. Pare down the menu, retrain your servers, and try again. If I'm in the area in need of a quick, tasty bite, I'll be heading to Shake Shack instead... and it's not because I'm a big burger fan."}
{"text":"Our server was what made our visit the best. Food was good, yes, but there are few and far between experiences that I've absolutely fell in love with and this is one of them. Thank you MAHA!!! Your are amazing"}
{"text":"The breakfast potatoes are delicious but the eggs Benedict were flavorless. The ham had zero flavor. How does that happens? The mac and cheese was really, really good and the polenta grits were okay. summary, we had a hit and miss experience."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban was even better than we expected.    I took my fiance here for his birthday dinner.  We made an early reservation for 5:00pm on a Friday.  It was perfect for us because we don't like crowded restaurants.   Our server Shwan, was great! He helped us pick out a couple of beers which we enjoyed very much.    We had the Sin City Burger and the Street Tacos plate.  The burger was delicious! Well cooked and the flavors really came together.  The fried egg was interesting and egg-citing!!! (sorry)  The egg had an earthy, home style flavor which complemented the richness of the bbq sauce and fried onions.  I ordered the 5 taco place which included one of each kind of taco on the menu.  My favorite was the pork belly taco based on the mingling of sweet and tangy flavors.  The pork belly was a little bit off putting visually but it is like a think cut bacon.    The taco I enjoyed the least was the shrimp and lobster.  The sauces and fixings on the taco were overpowering to the lobster and shrimp. They were too heavy.  The shrimp and lobster would have been lovely with just a little pico de gallo, perhaps a tiny amount of butter sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  I ended up picking out the lobster and leaving the rest of the taco.    Finally were surprised with a free birthday dessert.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I wish we were able to return next week."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at toms urban. Great food great atmosphere. The only thing I dislike is that there's one bathroom. Other than that good experience."}
{"text":"Service was slightly below average. Food was nothing special. It was sufficient sustenance a decent menu."}
{"text":"Customer service was great! I got the Adobe chicken street tacos with Pico on the side and nothing else on it. Because that's how street tacos are suppose to be, duh! The adobe chicken was so bomb! That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this new place (new to us). The hubs ordered two beers, I ordered a mix drink. We had 6 wings and the 3 steak tacos on fries. Our bill was $76!!!! The wings were fatty and not good at all. I think my husband ate two. The steak didn't seem like steak (imagine Taco Bell steak and that's what it taste like, and the fries looked like they were frozen and not fresh cut. Our waitress was awesome, that's the ONLY reason I'm giving them two stars! After a tip, we were really upset we paid over $90 for a meal that you could of gotten at Taco Bell or Sheetz for $10! VERY VERY Disappointed!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, this is one of the worst experiences I have had on the strip. Exceptionally low quality food, mediocre service, poor serving choices (plastic cups!?), and WAY overpriced. Avoid at all costs.   First of all, EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE. Yes it's on the strip and yes I understand it's a tourist trap, but I'm not a tourist I'm a local. If you're a local, stay far away from this place. There are spots on the strip that don't charge exorbitant prices just because they can. This is not one of those spots. This place just wants your money.  I ordered \"Al Carbon\" steak nachos and a milkshake. Let's start with the milkshake.  First, it came out in a plastic cup. A Solo cup-sized plastic cup, and it wasn't full. Second, it is quite thick, and comes with the same straws they use for the water. I can't drink it without the straw because I'll look like some kind of milk-mustached 3 year old. I can't use a spoon because there weren't any on the table. I can't use the straw it came with because the straw is far too small and the shake is much too thick. A buddy of mine grabbed me a big straw from the restaurant next door on his way in. The flavor was not good, just super sweet. A low-quality shake for sure. And on top of not being able to drink it, and not being very good, and being a very small quantity of shake in a plastic cup, it costs $8. WHAT A JOKE.  Steak nachos were awful. The meat was overcooked and poorly seasoned. The quality of the meat itself was extremely low. I asked for no cilantro, it came out covered in cilantro. The cheese and cheese sauce combination was terrible. The chips were cheap junk. There is nothing good to say about them. They also cost $18.  Our server was nice enough; she made a couple jokes and we got along fine, but she really didn't care about us as customers. She saw when she came by to refill drinks that I hadn't touched my nachos. (Because they were awful.) She never asked if they were alright (they were disgusting), she never asked if anything was wrong with them (they were covered in cilantro after I asked her for none), in fact the only thing she ever asked me about them was if I was finished. She didn't ask if I wanted a box when she came to take them away, so she obviously knew I was unhappy with them. Same lack of interest for all the others I was with."}
{"text":"I LOVE the location of Tom's Urban, its right on the strip and they have outdoor seating so you can people watch- which is highly entertaining in Vegas!  I ate here twice, both times off the late night menu.  The food was really good!  Tacos were really good and their French Fries duo- YUM!  The service kinda sucked.  They were slow and the food took a long time, which was really annoying because it was late at night, the restaurant wasn't busy, I was with a friend, and we each only got tacos and fries.  Slow service really annoys me, so that why I only gave it 3 starts, food however was 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great value! Had dinner here last night and the buffalo Chicken sliders were delicious with chopped up celery on each slider. Having brunch today with bottomless mimosas and the omelette is fantastic with 4 eggs and you can make it your own. The grits are perfect!  The best part is our server SAM - she is on point and very attentive with a fantastic personality!  This is a definite must stop when in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Eddie was awesome. He knew the menu very well made great recommendations and was happy to accommodate all of our requests for food allergies/preferences. Food was delicious. Prices are higher than what you're used to but in line with the rest of the strip."}
{"text":"Have been to toms urban 3 times in my last 2 trips to vegas. We always go for breakfast and it's AMAZING. the bottomless mimosas are worth the money. The staff is polite and do everything they can to meet your every demand. Will always keep coming back to toms every trip to vegas."}
{"text":"I'd say this restaurant was okay. Our group arrived at the outside entrance and asked for a table in which the hostess replied she didn't have anything, even though the restaurant had about 10 open tables just on the patio itself. She said the bar was available so we sat there, it was windy and a little cold outside. Later I found out there was a huge bar inside with about 20 seats available, which she would have mentioned that so we weren't as cold.   Our bartender was nice and our drinks delivered in a timely manner. Our food, however, came out all at different times. We had 5 in our group and each plate came out 5-7 minutes separate from each other which I thought was super weird. The food was ok, nothing too crazy. My pulled pork sandwich was a little dry but the sweet potato fries were great.   The restaurant itself is huge. From the inside of NYNY it looked small until you actually walked in. There is plenty of bar space and indoor outdoor tables. The menu had quite a selection and the cocktails were tasty. I just wished the service was a bit better."}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast on the strip. Stopped in here for a late breakfast before getting a flight on a Sunday. Breakfast burrito is huge and delicious. Eggs Benedict is cooked well. They offer healthy options like egg white omelettes too."}
{"text":"Have a 430 reservation- arrived at 415- wouldn't seat us in a totally empty restaurant until our reservation time- not off to a good start-I just didn't think the food was that good. I had the lobster mac & cheese. It legitimately tasted like boxed macaroni and cheese with supermarket shrimp thrown on the top of it. I found exactly one piece of lobster. Our waitress was wonderful. But she was the only bright spot of the entire evening--"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, quick service, well priced, nice outside seating to people watch (always fun in Vegas). Would recommend toms for brunch or late afternoon casual dinning."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/brunch yesterday. Was able to grab a spot in the bar. We had a Bourbon Bacon Mary which was pretty good. We ordered our food of breakfast burritos which took 45 minutes to an hour to come out. I had the breakfast burrito with steak (+$3) while my girlfriend had one with bacon. Mine was dissapointing for it barely had any steak in it, mostly egg. Not a great experience when you wait almost an hour for food and it comes out being below par."}
{"text":"We were both disappointed by our dinner at Tom's Urban.  The nachos had some kind of mystery cheese slurry on them and the cocktails were disappointing.  Salad was ok, but nothing to write home about. We did think the service was good, so that's a plus, but there are better food options on the strip."}
{"text":"Just ate here, Kelly the waitresses was awesome. We had the Cactus Ass Kick, Sin City Punch, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoe fries, Filet Mignon Sliders and Toms Butcher Steak..EXCELLENT...BEST DINING Experience..."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, chat, and just enjoy. The hostess is very friendly and kind. She even remembered me after my second visit.  The outdoor seating on a nice sunny day is beautiful. Just be aware that if you get a seat in the sun, it could get uncomfortably hot. Although they have most sprinklers to help cool down the area.  The waiters/waitresses are quick and friendly and they have your order out very quickly. The food is great and if you check in, you can receive a free order of fried pickles or brussell sprouts.  Seating: A in the shade. B+ in the sun Service: A+ Food: A"}
{"text":"Mehh... breakfast wasn't the best. I had the Urban platter that came with hasbrowns, 2 eggs, toast and bacon. The hasbrowns were extremely dry and tasted like they were thawed out. The eggs were okay. The bacon was maybe half inch strips, only two slices. The toast was the best thing on the platter. The jam was good too. I probably wouldn't go back to eat there."}
{"text":"Not even 'okay' food. I would not eat here again.  My sliders consisted of: hard bread, thin burger meat, a pickle in the burger and a pickle on top of the burger. So strange. McDonalds would have tasted better. I also ordered the Cesar. It tasted bitter with too much added kale, and they didn't even mix the dressing into the salad.  We  had to wait 30 minutes+ for our food on a day they weren't busy.  There are so many options on the strip. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great drinks and appetizers while watching the Wild. Shelby (TU!) is an awesome server!!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience, music, and feel but the food was really below average. We had the tacos fried pickles and some drinks.  drinks were small food was a small.   Only thing going for was location."}
{"text":"Delightful dining on the strip!  After a Yelp event, I had to come back to try it again.  It was early afternoon and not very busy.  We were seated immediately when our server was promptly over.  He was very attentive and friendly.  It was also nice of the manager to stop by our table to check on our experience. Great service!   Since I loved it so much the first time, we ordered the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip.  This comes with your choice of sweet potato fries or garlic fries.  This sandwich did not disappoint.  Mounds of shaved prime rib were piled high with melted havarti cheese on a brioche roll.  Yum.  Although we also ordered the Hot One Pizza, the sandwich would have been more than enough.  The shoestring garlic fries on the side had a great flavor although very greasy.  The hot one pizza is good with all of the spicy toppings they include - spicy giardiniera, jalapeños, spicy pepperoni and spicy oil.  Just make sure you have some water nearby.    We wouldn't hesitate stopping back in again.  Great location in NY NY with a great menu!"}
{"text":"Love the food service and everything.   Out of all the ny restaurants in vegas this is a must try"}
{"text":"I make it a point to stop visit Tom's Urban whenever I'm in Las Vegas. My recent visit was the best one yet.  The food is fantastic, especially the buffalo chicken sliders, and the service is better than many of the upscale restaurants in town.  Our server, Michael, was probably the best server I have ever had in terms of friendliness, recommendations, and speed."}
{"text":"As a tourist with a 16 year old vegan daughter we were looking for a fun lunch.  tom's Urban did not disappoint.  Great food, interesting cocktails, and good service also.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Place is nice inside, but that's it. We sat at the bar (which was dead, with 3 bartenders) and it took us 15 minutes to order drinks, 30 minutes to order food. The food was mediocre at best. We got the philly prime and the sin city burger. Both of which were similar quality to that of a lunchable. Too bad to, the place has a lot of potential. I love New York New York but will never go to Tom Urbans again."}
{"text":"Most of the restaurants had shut down for the night.  We came across Tom's Urban and scrambled in to satisfy some early AM cravings.  We sampled the carnitas taco trio, the pulled pork sandwich and garlic fries. Overall, the food was good, but not over the top.    Our server, Josh (sporting an aggressive undercut hairstyle), did a fine job.  He advised us the restaurant had only been open a couple of days.  When I mentioned I'd post one of the first Yelp reviews of the place, his eyes got a little buggy.  He asked what I would write and I told him I'd make sure to mention he did a great job of taking care of us.  Like any new restaurant, I expect Tom's Urban is trying to find it's legs. This place has a great location and potential.  I'll give Tom's Urban 3 stars for the food and dining experience and 1 star for feeding me when I really needed some late night chow."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had the opportunity to try multiple items on the menu. I enjoy their tacos, they are pretty tasty. I would say that my only complain is that the food was not that warm both times."}
{"text":"First timer and I must say.. Very interesting taste with this Bacon Bloody Mary thing for brunch. Too early was it? But the Brussel sprouts were amazing as well as the shrimp sliders if your into something a bit light."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing they had lobster & shrimp mac n cheese and that's all I ordered when I sat at the bar. It took a few minutes for the bar tender to stop her conversation and actually pay attention to me. My order came out fast and the first thing I noticed was, you do not get a lot for your money. The taste was very cheesy but that's it, it could use a spice or two to compliment the seafood."}
{"text":"Stopped in late after a show. Happy hour has $5 margarita and $5 chicken tacos. Had one of each. They were good - we sat in the bar because it was practically empty. Bartender - who waited on us - had a scowl on his face the whole time. Didn't seem happy to be there."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent service here this past weekend. The food was excellent also. And to the wise: if you check in here, you get a free appetizer which could be fried pickles or the crispy brussels sprouts. They have quite a large selection of bottles and draft beer, and the food selection is outstanding considering there are about six or seven pages of sandwiches, flatbread, salads, etc. No matter what you were in the mood for, you'll definitely find something. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it is extremely pricey to eat here, which is to be expected since it is in the New York New York hotel and resort. A major bonus about this place is the outdoor seating which makes for great people watching on the strip!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here during out last visit to Las Vegas. We started with the Xiangxiang Crispy Duck wings and they were really great. Sweet with a little hit of heat and just the right amount of crunch. The serving was of four wings but they were large drumettes, not the mid-sections, like I somehow imaged they'd be. We were contemplating ordering the calamari and our server steered us away from them, saying they weren't all that great. Kudos for the honesty - you don't get that from waitstaff very often.   Next, we put in an order for the Butter Poached Lobster and Shrimp tacos. We had high hopes and weren't disappointed in the least. A chipotle aioli played great against a crema with cilantro and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The two of us hadn't eaten since breakfast and were starving and wanted to try one more thing, so we wrapped up with an order of Shrimp and Grits. Again, the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The grits were the right consistency, but were a little underseasoned - nothing a couple of grinds of sea salt couldn't rectify.  We're in Vegas three or four times a year and definitely plan to make Tom's Urban a regular stop. There are plenty of great places to eat in town, but this one not only has a fun, eclectic menu, but it's executed well."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here after 40 minutes and finally got water. They finally brought our drinks...again after 40 minute...but forget one drink. So of course that means the drink was never ordered! Omg she just came with the drink! I'm guessing our food will be another hour and I'll be shocked if it's correct. Can I please give zero stars??? This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Lots of variety and really fun atmosphere! We had street tacos, sliders and wings and it totally hit the spot for our group! Lots of beer options too! Paige was a delight. Our family orite was the tater tots and lemon aoili."}
{"text":"This was a really good food experience. I had the filet mignon sliders, and wow, so delicious. Pricey though, that's the only downfall. Our server Miranda was amazing. The nachos were good and had pieces of tender steak on it (could have used a few more strips especially when sharing with 3 people. I also want to mention that restaurants like this in Vegas HAVE TO START SERVING SMIRNOFF ICE!!! Not everyone likes beer! It's a true story"}
{"text":"The menu looked fantastic and I was excited to go after seeing the 4.5 star reviews. I do want to acknowledge the great service I received! My waitress was friendly and made sure we were taken care of. However, there were items on the menu not available (nitro iced coffee w/ baileys) and the omelette my waitress recommended was so disappointing. The eggs were hard and dry. The hashbrowns were more like skinny french fries with solidified cheese on top. And my sourdough toast was rock hard (no butter available and it broke in large pieces like stale bread). I might come back for the fried pickles and teriyaki chicken dumplings appetizers (thank you, Yelp coupon!), but I will not buy breakfast items again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here to eat. He ordered a steak and I ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos. My husbands steak had no flavor to it whatsoever. It tasted like they only cooked the meat and it wasn't fresh. The Tacos were the same. The meat was fried and tasted very dull, had no flavor to it. Worst place to eat on our whole 4 day trip by far. I'm sure what keeps their doors open are their drinks, unfortunately we wouldn't know since we had drinks while walking the strip."}
{"text":"Great food!! We had breakfast here and it was delicious! Staff was super friendly and restaurant is very modern and comfy."}
{"text":"Great Service and delicious food, the lobster and shrimp Mac and Cheese is the Bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive. Had three Bloody Mary's that ended up being over 22 each!!! I looked and could not see any gold flakes so not sure why so pricey.  Food was so so. Definitely a tourist trap and not recommended."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast at Tom's Urban today and we were seated next to a very difficult customer. Our waiter Kyle was not only great to us but he also handled the difficult (and very racist) man expertly. He was kind and professional during the whole ordeal. He also was very generous with bottomless mimosas which we enjoyed. Five Aviva legs. This was our second time at Tom's Urban and we will be back for more! Also get the breakfast burrito it is scrumptious."}
{"text":"Huge menu selection  Had a barbecue, bacon, cheese burger Was really good Sat outside on strip and had a nice relaxing meal Good beer selection  Fried pickles were amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Rude server. Not welcoming at all.. They dont care about the customer. They have a nice interior and a cute outdoor sitting but terrible service!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time during the Beat the Clock specials and we had the following:  Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Ginger Chicken potstickers, Pork Belly Banh Mi and Mahi Mahi tacos.  Loved the Brussel Sprouts and Potstickers, and the portions are really good for the price.  The sauce that comes with the Brussel Sprouts was delicious but I preferred to eat the Potstickers without the sauce. The tacos only come with one taco, but the Banh Mi was very flavorful and hubby liked that better than the Mahi Mahi.  Delicious food and great prices if you can get the Beat the Clock!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have been here twice, and each time the food and service has been spot on! Be sure to ask for a seat outside to enjoy a great view of the strip with your meal, and hope that you get Eddie as your server :-) Oh, and if you're thinking of getting the al carbon steak nachos be prepares to share, they're pretty sizeable!"}
{"text":"....update to my review. We went back today for an early meal before the Miss USA pageant. The food as always was great. Colorado Calamari and Mini Mac & Cheese Pot for appetizer, Toms Butcher Steak and BLT Lobster Roll for main course. Our service by Rosa was prompt and exemplary. Also, thank you Doug from the corporate office for wanting us to give their staff a second chance to make up for their slow service."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waiter was friendly. Hash browns were $5 and they are enough for one person so for a side I thought that was extremely high. And $9 pancakes ??? Little much if you ask me but I would forsure eat here again !"}
{"text":"Food was great. Eddie was a great server. Patio is nice. It's a little pricey but can be justified by the delicious food and relaxing ambience."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant was so terrible!!! I had 4 different servers and even they where confused about what tables they had. The food was cold and horrible for the prices that they charge.  All around bad experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a local here in Vegas and came down to the strip to entertain some friends and family . We decided to dine at Tom Urbans inside the  NYNY and we're immediately  greeted by a manager name Joe  and were seated at the bar . Our bartender Jeff greeted us with a big smile eventhough he was busy he took the time to go over some of their specialty cocktails my favorite was their version of the Moscow mule and my girlfriend had a peach cosmo . After few a few drinks we all got hungry and decided to dine at the patio . The patio is outdoor overlooking the strip with beautiful views  . Our waitress Miranda was hands down the sweetest and nicest waitress I've been served by she was attentive and always had our water filled and the food was amazing and came out quickly . The favorite dishes of the night were the truffle pizza , carnitas  nachos and the Cuban sandwich :) . Overall it was an amazing experience , highly recommend to anyone on the strip looking for great spot yo watch games over great food, drinks and service ."}
{"text":"Screw other negative reviews, go make up your own mind.. I had mixed thoughts about coming in with bad and good reviews but I said what the heck let me see what the buzz is about! Had the Avocado Bacon burger and it was cooked to perfection with quick attentiveness by Frances, we had great service with all smiles...Even the MGR checked in with us to see if everything was good and that's what it's all about. (GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE) I finally found a place to come back too! Til next time Toms Urban Cafe   Check them out! Great service!! Ask for Frances"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Tom's Urban, so much so that I even stopped here twice during my visit in Vegas.  The first time I had a bunch of snacks as my meal: roasted edamame w jalapeños, kale salad side, chicken potstickers and cheesy polenta side. I was happy my eclectic choices.   What's extra great was that they had a sparkling wine that was delicious and only $7 a glass with a nice pour.   This place was extremely comfortable temperature-wise because they have shaded outdoor seating with nearby misters to keep you cool and indoor seating if you opt to go inside. I found a little spot at the end of the bar where it's a perfect balance of not too cool from inside air conditioning yet not too hot from being fully outside. And lots of activity for people watching! As well as TVs if there's a sport you needed to catch.   Both bartenders that's served me had great personalities. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We came to Toms Urban to watch the USC game. Joanna the hostess went out of her way to accommodate us so we could watch the game comfortably. Excellent employee. Thank you Joanna.  Also our waitress Ruth was very pleasant. She was great to us. Thank you Ruth!    We will be back."}
{"text":"We will be returning this weekend, so hopefully I can update this review with a better experience."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome way to start your day on the strip! Marie is the absolute best! She will not let you wait for anything, has your order set almost before you make it! Thank you Marie for your awesome service today!! Highly recommend bottomless mimosas and beach bum omelette!"}
{"text":"Upon entering from the LV Blvd side, the patio looked nice and relaxing as they were all filled up.  We walked up, were greeted by the hostess and seated right away.  Checking out the bars, monitors, modern tables, and the overall roominess of the place made for a great layout.    Our server was April, and she did an excellent job!  Presented the menus, made a few good suggestions, and followed up with us as we grubbed on our order.  Here's the goods we had: ~ Colorado Hot Brown: ($21) Slices of turkey and ham sitting on top of a piece of sourdough bread, but imagine it smothered with a pork green chili sauce and tomato.  This is no sandwich mind you!  And finally to add on top, sprinkles of melted pepper jack and cheddar cheese, and applewood-smoked bacon.  Served with you choice of shoestring garlic fries or sweet potato fries.  I chose the yummy crispy garlic shoestring fries.  As for the Hot Brown itself, it wasn't bad at all.  A tad salty.  There was also bit of heat with the nice chili sauce, but overall a great combo of meat.  Almost stew-like.  ~ Truffled Maine Lobster Roll: ($22) Maine lobster with a truffled mayo on a butter-toasted brioche roll.  Not bad not bad!  I gotta say it was nice and lobster meaty.  In comparison, I also tried a lobster roll from Phillip's Seafood at Ceasar's.  Now the textures were quite similar, but Tom's roll just beat them out.  It's gotta be the truffle flavor!  If you can't decide, choose this.  Now, I can't say that I totally fell in love with the place, but I can't say I hated it either.  With only an average taste, the prices sorta speak for themselves when browsing through the menu.  IMO, this was a straight 3.5 star experience simply because of the good clean atmosphere and great service, but I'm being generous by rounding up.   ~ Would I be back to try something different?  Yes.   ~ Is it worth a try?  Check the menu, and if price isn't your issue, then Yes.  There's a lot of good looking items on that menu."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and the treehouse eggs Benedict was delicious.  I ordered it with bacon $2 extra but worth it.  Lots of avocado.  Came back for drinks and apps and loved the duck wings.  Try the Pineapple Cider."}
{"text":"Eveytime I am in Vegas this is a breakfast staple. Great service coupled with delicious food. The eggs are cooked to perfection every time.....every time. Give it a chance..."}
{"text":"Over priced with absolutely horrible pathetic terrible service with average food at best the wait staff has the personality of being tortured just to be there, not only did we wait 10+min just for a waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink but every table around us was no different, we witnessed one table just get up and leave with one table having to go find somebody to wait in them, You're better off going to the food court. Multiple time of year Vegas visitors here and we will never again even think about this dump"}
{"text":"Really great bar food and nice outdoor seating make this an ideal spot for a leisurely meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I really enjoyed the food. We came for breakfast and I had their Eggs Benedict and they were delicious. Place is very nice and our waitress was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Neat place! I stopped by for breakfast and was very pleased with everything!   I had the Lemon Poppyseed Blueberry pancakes with sweet cream and was yummy. Had a very unique flavor and the pancakes where soft and delicious!   The place itself is nice, and has outdoor and indoor seating. Also, the service was great! The server was    attentive and available, but not the over your-shoulder type, which is perfect.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"went here twice while 4 days in Vegas, for late breakfast.   Eggs Benedict with avocado  Breakfast burrito with carnitas  both dishes tasty, well prepared and high quality   portions will satisfy the hungry,   price is good value for overall quality and taste"}
{"text":"Amazing sliders!!! Both the honey-chicken ones and the prime rib sliders.   The bloody Marys were just okay. I didn't realize that in the world of bloody Marys, you now have to specify if you actually want it spicy. As a result, ours was a bit bland, so we tried to spice it up with some table condiments. Our server checked on us, and we told him it was kind of blah, so he offered to take it back to the bartender. He actually returned with the same glass; half doctored-up by us, and half doctored-up by the bartender, and it was awful! Strange method for fixing up a broken cocktail. I'd expect a bit more care and quality from a bartender.  Also, the service here really took quite a while. Four cocktails and two appetizers for four people took us easily over an hour. We waited quite a while for our check, too."}
{"text":"The food was incredible, and our waiter, Michael, was really amazing! He made us feel so welcome and like we have been friends forever! Awesome dining experience!"}
{"text":"First and foremost.... Michael is AMAZING! Hands down, the best service we have gotten since we have been here. Delightful personality, reads his guests well and truly gets to know them. He made fabulous recommendations for both myself (carnivore) and my vegan pal.  The menu is impressive.   Definitely do the philly cheese steak and for sure the shrimp and lobster tacos.  Holy heaven!  I'm sad we don't have a Tom's Urban or a server as great as Michael back home.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"They have a diverse menu and a really cool atmosphere. My husband and I both had the Chimichurri Steak Frites.  It was so good and very big portions.  It was 2 full size pieces of Argentinean style skirt steak, topped with a herb chimichurri sauce and garlic fries.  Honestly, it's enough for two people to share.  I also had the pomegranite/lime iced tea which was yummy.  They have flat screen TV's all around. You can access the restaurant from the strip or inside New York New York Hotel/Casino.  The prices were average for Las Vegas but the food was well worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful patio. Wonderful waitress. Beer prices are extremely high but I guess that goes with the real estate that it is attqched to being on the main drag in Vegas.  Nachos where huge and the salads where fresh"}
{"text":"Crap. I had a simple two poached eggs with sausage hash browns and avocado. The eggs were inedible, they used so much vinegar when poaching them that they were sour, gummy, and left a film on my teeth. The \"secret\" to poached eggs is actually just using fresh eggs, you dont even need vinegar and if you do use it, it's just a smidge, they shouldn't taste like vinegar. The hash browns which I swear had a (v) on the menu were actually a blob of fried and congealed cheese with some shoestring potatoes in there. I'm not vegan but I don't eat dairy so I was unpleasantly surprised when I got my food. My husband got the bacon skillet which was not as scary as my order but very greasy and although he could typically eat like a horse he picked around and left half which says something. Place was slow when we were there and the waitress was very nice and only charged me for the avocado which is all I wound up eating."}
{"text":"This was definitely the most unpleasant meal we had while visiting Las Vegas.   I could talk about the rude hostess, the long wait, or the vanishing server but I think I will focus on the food.   The food itself is about the same quality as a Denny's. We started with a pizza as an appetizer, and it tasted like something purchased in the frozen food aisle and warmed up in a microwave. I expect food to be overpriced in Vegas, but at the very least it should taste good.  We should have known better after the pizza experience, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to order the street tacos. They were miniature, cold, and barely edible. Quite honestly, these tacos were insulting to tacos everywhere.  After realizing how awful the food was, we went next door to Shake Shack. After our experience at Tom's Urban, Shake Shack tasted like heaven.  I have never felt the need to write a Yelp review until my meal at Tom's Urban. I'm trying really hard to think of one positive thing to say...but I am drawing a blank. If you want to stay open in a city with so many great restaurants, you'll have to do better."}
{"text":"Drinks were on point, food was generous and delicious. Service was friendly and respectful. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is located on the main strip in Las Vegas and have a beautiful outdoor seating area which is ideal for drinks and a lazy brunch while enjoying the Vegas weather!  We were seated inside for our lunch on this occasion which was a bit chilly on account of the air conditioning (however it was extremely hot outside so this maybe wasn't a bad thing), the waitress was so nice and friendly and gave advice on the cocktails and meals available, she also gave us loads of time to decide without pressuring us to order.  I opted for the shrimp po boy sliders, my partner ordered the stack of ribs and the rest ordered the sin city burgers! There was no side with my meal which made it feel quite small, whereas all the other meals came with fries etc.  The cocktail I went for was the sangria rojo which was delicious and some of my party went for the sin city punch, we were divided on that one-some loved it and some hated it lol  All in all this is a lovely wee place for a meal and a drink...next time I'd choose to sit outside for the nice weather."}
{"text":"The pancakes were absolutely amazing, not your typical pancakes definitely recommend having a go at this place"}
{"text":"Today me and my girlfriend decided to try something different and eat out on the strip, which we never do, but to our delight we were encountered an amazing experience at tom's!! We were attended by Michelle and we sat out on the balcony which felt amazing outside! The food came with quick waitress time and she gave us great service and a smile to boot! Thanks Michelle we will definitely return thanks to your amazing service tonight!"}
{"text":"Consistency is key in a restaurant so this year during our annual trip to Vegas we stayed at NYNY and decided to eat every main meal at Tom's to see if it was as good this  year as it was last year.  Items consumed included cheeseburger sliders (incredibly juicy, usually at places those little patties are dried out because they're small but these had juice running down my arm.. no lie!).. the spicy fried chicken and cornbread pancake (delicious and definitely spicy).. figgy piggy (lovely combination).. honey bbq chicken sliders (yum).. ginger chicken potstickers (crisp on bottom, soft inside like it's supposed to be & great dipping sauce) and we finally tried some desserts: the pineapple upside down cake (delicious albeit small) and the ridiculously ENORMOUS brownie/cookie/s'mores dessert which was decadent over the top but a decent value for $10 (easily would serve 4 people).. service was absolutely fine by 5 different servers (we had 5 meals there) so not sure why I see so many issues on their YELP page about service. We never had to wait long for anything, water was promptly filled, managers stopped by to check in and make sure needs were met.  So, our 2016 visit wasn't a fluke. 5 stars for 5 different meals. The only thing that would be cool is a frequent diner discount. haha Looking forward to going back again next year if not sooner!"}
{"text":"I was here as part of a larger party (7) for dinner. We were seated promptly, with a reservation, and the service was was initially fine. First round of drinks and our food were timely (although one order was completely wrong), but then he disappeared! I had to go to the bar multiple times to get water refills, which is unacceptable. Forgot ordering another round...   I got the cheeseburger sliders and they were just fine. Nothing at all special, but ok. I tried a bite of the steak tacos and they were much better but still nothing to justify the price.   Overall, I may come back for drinks and people watching (patio overlooks the strip), but I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"My lady and I came to this restaurant for our Valentine dinner date and had a wonderful experience. Our service Eddie was exceptional he was very attentive quick knowledgeable and had an amazing attitude I'm giving it 5 stars because I'l it was an all-around great experience with awesome food"}
{"text":"Checked in to New York, New York; after a long flight we were starving! Sat down right away and ordered the sim city burger and fired pickles. Eddies recommendation was on point! Best server around, request him if possible. Good spot"}
{"text":"Great place to people watch.... The food is eclectic and a wide range of alcoholic beverages for everyones taste.  I had the Toms Cup and the Veggie Omelet with Polenta Cheese Grits.  I ended up  having to have two servings of grits, they were great.   Jeannie was our server and has the best personality with a killer smile. Ken had the chiliquiles better than what we get at home.   I would highly recommend this establishment for a memorable trip to the strip in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A large group of my friends ate here before the Billy Joel concert and wine tasting a couple weeks ago and the service was AH-mazing! This place has high-end comfort/bar food and it didn't let us down. The servers were on point with checking in on our needs without being overly attentive. We had one minor issue and \"Hancock\" handled it immediately! he was such a character and made sure we were taken care of and even came and checked on us before we were finished.  My only disappointment was that I forgot to order the gourmet pop tart! hahaha!"}
{"text":"Delicious and HUGE portions. Atmosphere is great but the customer service is beyond wonderful. Not only was our server, Maha just fantastic by constantly checking on us, great conversation, but so did the managers. All of the food was seriously so scrumptious that we are coming back tomorrow for lunch. This is now on our must eat places when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"wonderful staff & great food.  With check in , we got FREE fried pickles - it was delicious."}
{"text":"My experience  didn't start too good at this place. It was filthy and as soon as I went to seat down I got my hands and clothes dirty from sauce left on the seat probably  from people that was there before. Not that the place was busy and for sure they would have enough time to clean up after people's mess. The host did not care and I had to dig my purse to find something to clean up myself. I tried to seat somewhere else and realize this whole place were dirty. I didn't want to take any chances to eat there and I left with my family.  Heading off to Brio, always a good experience there."}
{"text":"Came here last time I was in Vegas for brunch and had to come back. The breakfast burrito is spectacular. Both times I have gotten it with the carnitas but my boyfriend likes the steak or sausage. I also enjoy it with goat cheese instead of the recommended cheddar and jack. When you order it the first thing you will think is, \"there's no way I'm going to finish this,\" but trust me...it's so good you will."}
{"text":"Very hearty breakfast portions, so much so that I could take half of it home and eat it the next day. Created my own omelet (bacon, red peppers, goat cheese) and it was tasty. Hash browns were also good. Definitely large enough to split and save money."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the family - pancakes ridiculously large (10 & 14yo boys didn't eat enough to finish one serve) and they didn't seem to enjoy them that much.  My eggs were cooked nicely, but the potatoes were under done. The meal was way too big.  We could have shared the serves and saved $$$.  Like Las Vegas in general, overpriced."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food  Good service too!  Ordered:  Lobster and shrimp tacos New York 16 oz Strip Crispy shrimp and Fried chicken (more like chicken tenders)  Nothing wow'd; but overall good Nice big screens for the game"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to meet up at Toms Urban the other night after work for some cocktails and laughs. We met at the bar and decided just to stay and order food instead of sitting at a table. I have to say that the best part of our night was the service we received from our bartender, Juan. JUAN is the BOMB! He went above and beyond to make sure that all of our needs were met. He was on top of everything from all the signature cocktails we ordered to the numerous small plates we devoured. He was so attentive and seemed to genuinely care about experience there. He is also very easy on the eyes!! I love that the bartenders were wearing bowties and suspenders! All of the cocktails and small plates were delicious! We all agreed to make Tom's Urban our new hangout!"}
{"text":"Loved Toms Urban. I've been to both the Denver and LA versions and this one has the best of both mixed in.  Started off with the Brussels sprouts which were amazing. I'm not normally a Brussels sprouts fan so I was wary when they were recommended.  Glad I choose to get them they were awesome. Next I had a chicken burrito. It was very good, just flat out a good burrito.  For dessert I had three things with my group. We had the cheesecake, excellent crust and a good taste throughout, also the pineapple upside down cake was very good as well.  Finally on a hunch I order pop tarts which are not on the dessert menu.  All I can say is that you have to try them, very unique and very good.  Overall a great experience, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and our server Miranda was the best. Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"Great location, right next to the Brooklyn bridge. Ordered the banh mi burger with garlic fries. The flavors was good tasted just like a real banh mi. But the bun itself was hard, guess it was almost like a Pretzel bun without the actual taste of one. Def needed to toast the bun or use another type of bun. The fries had really good taste with the garlic and butter. To top it off the ketchup salsa was on point with the fries.   Overall experience pricing was little high, food was decent, scenery was nice and location was perfect."}
{"text":"First time here. Food is excellent and the portions are huge. Had to ask for a doggie bag"}
{"text":"Arrived right as the place opened and were seated at a small two-top, even though the place was empty. Couldn't ask to change since she dropped our menus and ran. Tried the cherry house made pop tart and the classic eggs Benedict. Both were good but not amazing. Pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"First visit here for dinner. Decided to dine on the outside patio because it was a nice evening; such a great choice.  The food was reasonably priced and the menu had a variety of options. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"SERVICE IS AWFUL: The hostess MARISSA told us there was no wait ... 30 minutes later she told us it would be another 30 to 45 minutes. I tried to get a Bloody Mary from the bar from VICTORIA in the meantime and one of the customers had to tell her, \"that girl has been waiting for a long time\". I ordered and she proceeded to serve everyone but me. Turn around time 20 min at the bar. TIME TO GET SEATED, ONE HOUR FOR 4 PEOPLE.  To her defense, our waitress did try to manage expectations in terms of wait time, she was attentive and comped us a drink.   FOOD WAS COLD AND SUB PAR: eggs Benedict, nothing special. Shrimp salad, spinach was okay but the shrimp was GROSS. Tacos, corn tortilla was hard and yet somehow soggy.   SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY AND ENERGY to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight at Tom's! Pickled fried chicken and half rack of ribs were amazing. Chicken was juicy and just the right amount of crispy/salty goodness. Ribs were fall off the bone tender and good flavor. Love the flavored ketchups and fresh fries. The atmosphere is inviting and our server was excellent, not sure her name but she is originally from Poland. We will definitely be back to take advantage of breakfast and or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Apparently they just hire cooks, not chefs. Because I'm fairly certain no chef would pass this sad dish off as avocado toast. To be fair, this is not on their menu, but damn."}
{"text":"Shelby was our server as we watched the Wild win. She was efficient, so friendly, and energetic. She made our time her so enjoyable as we had drinks and apps. Thank you. '"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is in a great location on the strip and also near the T mobile arena so easy access to enjoy a drink or dinner after an event. The outdoor area is really nice too! The bartenders/servers outside are great too! will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant right on the strip. Great food at reasonable prices. (For Vegas) Loved that it opened up to the strip. Great people watching. I want to give a shout out to Charles our server for breakfast. Great server with tons of positive energy. I also want to thank the manager who always made a point to say hi to us. If you go for breakfast do yourself a favor and get the bacon infused bourbon Bloody Mary. Damn good!!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't like writing bad reviews, but unfortunately we did not have a good experience here last night. When we arrived, they were very busy. We had a reservation, but had to wait 30 minutes for our table. The hostess seemed very overwhelmed and forgot about us multiple times. She even asked my name multiple times to confirm the reservation. Once we were finally seated we ordered beer and water. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. At that time we asked to put in our appetizer and dinner order to try and speed up the process (we were going to a hockey game and didn't want to be late). 45 minutes later we received our food. It was frustrating because others around us who ordered after us, ate and left before we even got our food. Some guests in our party never even received their food. We had to ask for the check and leave, because we were going to be late for the game. We asked our server to take the food we never received off of our bill. He was hesitant at first, but finally agreed. He argued with us, and then realized he made a mistake. We will stick to Shake Shack and Bruxie's from now on."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. All of the food was ice cold and clearly made with low quality ingredients. Should have gone to shake shake next door."}
{"text":"Really really liked this place.  A needed edition to New York New York's dining options.  Especially for breakfast options as I do not like any of the others.  The portions were extremely large and there were many interesting and enjoyable things on the menu.  The truffled lobster roll was relish as were the crispy brussel sprouts and fries two ways.  In fact we like this place so much we went there four times during our stay.   I guarantee you will not go hungry here and the quality and service are worth the price.  Speaking of the price this is one of the more reasonable options on the strip!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good and the service was friendly. Most of our party ordered omelettes and we all loved them!  I got a veggie omelette and added bacon with a side kale salad. It was really good!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my son. We had the kids dill brined chicken fingers and the cuban sandwich. The service was great and the food was awesome. The only reason I took a star away was because of the $17 beer. Yes, it was a 40oz but come on.... it's beer.   I would recommend this place to friends visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Discovered this place across from MGM on Saturday afternoon. The 4 of us had  great meals. Shrimp and grits were fantastic, pancakes were yummy, and the service was slow but good.  We went back today and ordered pancakes, tacos, hamburger and  meat lovers salad with flatbread- between the four of us. The meat lovers salad had very little chicken, ham and maybe a few crumbs of bacon.  No dressing or flatbread was brought with it and when I asked for the dressing and flatbread was rudely told they were out of flatbread. So, I asked for something else and was offered english muffins or sourdough. I choose sourdough and 15 minutes later was brought pita bread and the dressing.  The burger was literally raw and should have been medium, tacos were editable but not wonderful and the pancakes were okay. There are so many other great choices in Vegas that there is  no need to pay for mediocre food and rude service."}
{"text":"Jeannie was our server and let us start by saying she was just absolute awesome! We have eaten at a few resturants in Vegas this trip and have had nothing but bad experiences but this experience was GREAT. She was very attentive and sweet and didn't act like we were a burden like some servers we have been getting this trip. If you come here and Jeanine serves you you will not be disappointed. GREAT FOOD GREAT SERVICE A+"}
{"text":"First off, great showing of customer service by Tom's Urban reaching out to me after my last visit and encouraging me to come back. And second, I'm so glad I did come back.  On our return visit: - 'A' on the cocktails. Perfectly made and tasty. Tip: Get the bacon bourbon bloody mary. - 'A' on the service. Michael was a wonderful server. Friendly, helpful, attentive, funny, etc. The complete opposite of our last experience. - 'A' on the food. We left full and very pleased with our food decisions.  The mac 'n' cheese pot was superb. Far better than I even remembered from my very first visit. And the green chile was even better. It was spicier and more flavorful. And the macaroni was perfectly cooked and was full of cheesy goodness. This is one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas. It's officially in my top 5.  The buffalo wings were great. They're of average size, but very good quality. Cooked well - not too greasy, not too crispy. Excellent sauce coverage. I just wish they were spicier. But the flavors are good and will please those who aren't super spicy fans. (Unfortunately, the ghost pepper sauce was not available as apparently it's not all that popular. Otherwise, we would've been eating those wings.) We opted for both the blue cheese and green chile ranch dipping sauces. Both were excellent. So all needs in my wings were met - quality, sauciness, and good dipping sauces.  The hangover slopper was huge and delicious. This is the regular slopper, but with a fried egg on top. And a runny egg always makes everything even better. We were actually asked how we wanted our burger cooked this time. And it came out nice and edible. And again, the green chile was even better than before. I practically wanted to lick the plate. It was some seriously delicious green chile. And it's awesomely enjoyed when there's a burger and fried egg involved. This is a tasty dish. And it's definitely big enough to share.  All in all, we had an excellent return visit. This spot is back on the list of my favs. If you're looking for tasty comfort food with a twist in a laid-back, enjoyable environment, Tom's Urban is a wonderful choice. And if you like mac 'n' cheese, wings, and/or green chile, you've got to come here."}
{"text":"Food took over 45 min to finally get to the table, but was good."}
{"text":"We had the Honey BBQ wings scale of 1 to 5( 3.5)  shrimp Po Boy and Brussel Sprouts scale of 1 to 5 (1.5) and one other member had the Big Ass Egg Roll scale  1 to 5 (-2) not good at all ...the Fries 2 ways hmmm....how about get it right 1 way first ... very thin and hard.... not busy an service was still slow... most likely wont be back.."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy when I got there. We were asked if we would mind waiting because the servers were overwhelmed so we stood there talking to the hostess for a few minutes. She could barely talk and kept apologizing for it, but she was terrific made some suggestions and was super friendly, once we finally got a table I ordered the urban slopper per the hostess's recommendation and it didn't disappoint. Service was slow and the food took a while to get out but Mariah came by often to check on us. Didn't catch the servers name but she was running around a lot and seemed a little over extended so I can understand. All in all I work nearby and would probably come back"}
{"text":"Location right on the strip. Great for people watching and soaking up the morning sun. Very wide variety breakfast menu. Ordered the Figgy Piggy; one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! The grits were also cheesy and creamy and out of this world good. Coffee also very rich dark roast excellent taste. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The vibe is casual and up beat and the seating is comfortable.  The service is friendly but mediocre. We went for a late dinner (about 9:30) on a Sat. night. The place was busy but not full, yet no server came to our table. After 10 min., we flagged down a passing waiter who said it wasn't his station but he'd be happy to serve us. The portions are reasonable to generous, the prices are also reasonable for casual dining and cheap for Vegas. Once the food got to us, I forgave the questionable start.    The food is fabulous!  I had the \"Sticky\" Belly Steamed Buns appetizer and the Sadler's Texas Pulled Pork BBQ.  Both were well seasoned and delicious!  The entree came with shoestring garlic fries which were skinny, crisp and garlicky and accompanied by a distinct homemade ketchup.  My friend had sweet potato fries and that was accompanied by a different ketchup. Each side is paired with its own variation of homemade ketchup.   The pulled pork was cooked perfectly with just right amount of BBQ sauce so that's the tasty but the bread doesn't get mushy. I had half the next day and it was still delicious and not mushy. Am considering going back tonight!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING  Get your attention? This horrible review follows up my NY, NY review I just finished. What a way to end my already horrible CES stay in Vegas.  I had a comp from MLIFE -- because I dropped $2k on the tables -- that I figured I should use before I leave. Tom Urban was the new spot at New York, New York so I thought, why not?  The comp was $49 dollars, which was plenty to have breakfast, even if I decided to get the most expensive thing on the menu.  I ordered the Filet Mignon and Eggs and a side of pancakes, because, why not? The filet mignon and eggs came out at a decent time, but not the pancakes. I went to cut into my steak only to realize I didn't have a steak knife. So after waiting 5-minutes my waitress to come back to check on me, and for me to ask for a damn knife, I picked away at the eggs and potatoes. They were just.. ok.  I finally get my knife and cut into the filet mignon medallions. They were bloody red, which wasn't what I ordered. I asked for medium and it was far too rare.  At this point I'm just annoyed, even if this wasn't my money paying for the meal. Now 20-minutes into my meal and the pancakes are still missing. You can tell the waitress forgot to put in that order with the way she was talking to the other help. When I finally receive the pancakes I noticed one is missing, but say nothing. I knew I wasn't going to be eating all of them, but wanted to at least taste them.  About 15-minutes after eating the pancakes and finishing up the rest of my meal a waiter comes over and says, \"I'm so sorry, you were suppose to have 3 pancakes, not 2. I'm going to bring another one over to you.\" In which I said, are you serious?  Now on to the fun part. The food poisoning. I'm going to go ahead and say it was the meat. The filet mignon was not good.. at all. I only took a few bites of it, and that's all I can think about making me sick.  To the management of Tom Urban: I know you're new and all, but that's no excuse for shit service and bad food."}
{"text":"Just wanna drop a quick thank you to our awesome waiter Eric for taking great care of us while visiting this spot. Dude makes you feel like you're at his home. We'll definitely be back here for some good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Can't give it a 5.  We had a fun time here.  Great outdoor seating with a view of the strip.  People watching heaven! ;)  Cocktails were good and good selection of beers.  One beer sent back because it was flat - no biggie, got a new one.  We had the fries two ways, (but they came out cold - sent back for a reheat) pot stickers, edamame, and brussel sprouts to start - all really good.  Dinner we had - Sin City burger, lobster/shrimp mac and cheese and a breakfast burrito.  No complaints on the food.  Waitress was a little ditzy and not all that we ordered came out as expected but nothing to write home about and not a reason not to go back.  Sh!t happens.  Big place, super cool decor and seating.  We will def be back."}
{"text":"The arugula salad with goat cheese had about a tablespoon of pepper flakes on it. It was close to inedible. I would go back, but next time I'd order it without any pepper."}
{"text":"Menu looks very appetizing, the realization is that the kitchen does not perform well.  We ordered from the small bites menu, and two of the selections were not up to standard.  The flatbread on the humus selection first served was cold, tough and chewy.  We asked for a re-do of the flatbread and the result was great, the bread was warm, tasty and as it should have been in the first place.  The other disappointment was the fries two ways.  The regular fries with truffle oil were delicious, but the sweet potato fries were a disaster.  They were not hot, not crispy, and not tasty.  Fail.  The lobster sliders contained well prepared lobster salad, but the buns were almost a copy of the flatbread failure.  They tasted old and stale. This kitchen needs to do much better on the First try in order to retain business!!"}
{"text":"I think this is a pretty decent value for a restaurant on the strip, with a strip view for people watching. The two of us just got a salad and the side Mac n cheese , which was more than enough. The salad was huge , the total was around 22 dollars ! Service was good. Food was very decent."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on our way out of Vegas.  We loved our table outside so we could people-watch as tourists strolled by.  They didn't have many veggie options (which was a surprise), so I got seafood. The food was pretty good, though the scene is the main reason to come here.  Very relaxing too."}
{"text":"Sloooow service and mediocre food. Ordered the overpriced lobster roll which turned out to be imitation lobster. Everything else was just as bland. The only thing we liked was the Mama Birch burger, and the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here one Vegas morning and it did the trick but had some issues for sure. Nothing amazing. I ordered over easy eggs and they were fully cooked - not a single bit of runny yolk. Hash browns are actually just a bucket of cheese with a few potatoes which they don't tell you at all on the menu. So if you don't eat cheese like me be sure to ask for one. Sent them back and they forgot, brought back out after everyone's food was totally done so I didn't even get to enjoy them. Toast needs butter! Dry as the desert. Final complaint is there are no turkey breakfast meats."}
{"text":"Service was awesome... April was our waitress...extremely nice, attentive, and worked with a sense of urgency..the garlic fries are better than Gilroy garlic fries...and the lobster roll was awesome..."}
{"text":"They don't serve food at the little tables on the left side of the patio just beverages and the wait can be a tad long if you wish to sit outside--and face it we ALL want to sit outside.   The hostess gals were super duper nice and I was able to snag a high top for brunch with my man.  They offer a nice check in deal and we took advantage of getting some friend pickles that were delicious little salt bombs of flavor.  They had some nice beers available and I ordered up the standard food of eggs, toast, and bacon.  We also indulged in one of those homemade pop tart pastries.  Not too shabby...."}
{"text":"I order the fish tacos.......almost no fish.....they would be broke fast where I come from. $17, honestly I left hungry.....no beans or rice with.  Service was slow but very friendly.  Great spot to watch people go by.  Very expensive for so little food."}
{"text":"Average food.  Ordered a mac n cheese with bacon and jalapenos.  The food was ok and a small portion for 8$.  Server was great and attentive to refill water.  Sat outside which was nice for people watching."}
{"text":"Awesome food,staff and atmosphere. Eat the picked brine chicken! Had my taste buds dancing"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with a large group after seeing KA. There were 10 in our party. Everyone enjoyed their food, service was great for us (fast seating, good service, drinks kept coming). I still wish I hadn't had a moscow mule (my fridge is now full of ginger beer and my cabinet full of vodka).   The highlight for me was definitely the braised short ribs and cheddar polenta. so delicious and satisfying in the way that only something with real fat in it can be. Even thinking about it my mouth is watering. I wish I were in vegas more often so I could go through the rest of the menu. I recommend going with at least three friends so you can all have something different and try each others. Take your time and enjoy their cocktails, they were all great."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if that was an option. Awful, horrible, horrendous, disappointing...pick your adjective. This place had by far the WORST service in all of Vegas. I expect more fron Taco Bell! We waited over an hour for sliders...yes, sliders! Food was okay.  By the time we ate we were over it. 1/2 off our bill comped didn't make up for the lack of service. Bartender was MIA. Servers were lazily sitting around. One was even dropping F bombs at the end of the bar...nice talk sugar lips! Wanted to like this spot but hated it. Will NEVER be back. Horrible. Is it wrong  that I hope it goes out of business for something better."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks.  Only had the \"Al carbon steak\" nachos,  but they were so so good.  Not enough steak,  but that was expected.  Back to the drinks,  the Tom Collins,  was amazing ....had cucumber and mint, so refreshing! Cactus Ass Kick was also delicious,  but quite rum-y.. . Still good tho"}
{"text":"Horrible,horrible slow slow service. We got there for breakfast. 20 minutes at least for the food to come out. 10 minutes to order, 10 to even pay the bill. Food was fine but the service here is a MAJOR deterrent. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night ! No reservation , got seated quickly. Service was top notch ( thank you Paige ) . Wife and I had some small plates , Duck wings , Brussels sprouts , and lettuce cups ! All delicious , lettuce cups were probably the best with the wings a close second and the Brussels sprouts were delicious. Had a few cocktails , Tom Collins and the gin and juice - both solid choices. Try this place, definitely worth it if your in this area."}
{"text":"Big Ass Eggroll was on top!  Perfect mixture of an Eggroll and chimichanga.. Spice blend was completely Asian inspired and executed to perfection!  Word to your mother"}
{"text":"I had really been looking forward to trying Tom's because I had been in Vegas a year earlier and waits were so long that I didn't stay but figured the food must be great.  Booked a reservation this time.  Ambiance is nice as well as view from patio but food was so mediocre.  Husband and I shared pork belly Banh Mi tacos and a Cuban sandwich.  Not the normal meat preparation for Banh Mi, more of a thick slice of fatty ham, flavor was OK but nothing we would eat again.  Cuban was decent but far from the best Cuban I've had.  What really turned me off to Tom's was the drunk couple sitting in the patio harassing and insulting people walking by on the street and in the restaurant.  I'm sure the drunk woman must pride herself on how many bars she's been kicked out of because she kept asking the waitress if she was going to get kicked out.  By the time I left she was still not kicked out.  For a higher end restaurant it cheapened the feel and shows poor management."}
{"text":"The breakfast is excellent, omelette is awesomely catered to my desired flavor. Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and top notch service!!! Make sure you sit at Spenser's bar - he is so dedicated and caring, he will make sure your experience was nothing less than amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Considering I went here every day for breakfast I would say it's pretty fantastic.  Drinks are good (yet pricey even beer but what isn't in Vegas), food however, is not terribly overpriced."}
{"text":"Yummy little sandwich - the lobster was pretty darn good, the bread was not good enough for this meal. If the bread would have been fresher, fluffier, and probably butterier this would have been a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Stopped by here before we started our day. I wasn't too hungry for a big breakfast plate so I figure I order the pizza. I should have just paid a couple more dollars for the breakfast plate instead. Would have been more worth it.  The pizza was about 11 inches cut up in 4 peices. It was soft and chewy and tasted very generic. I make better pizza in the oven buying it from the store.   If I ever came back, I know not to at least get the pizza.  My guy had burger and garlic fries.  I didn't care for the fries but they were VERY greasy! So just a heads up for that one."}
{"text":"Nice. Not the best but comfortable. Dick wings were good. Everything else was just ok. Drinks on par and service was good."}
{"text":"Our server Chester was amazing!!! Very attentive and friendly. Food was great! Breakfast is served all day. I ordered the Urban Breakfast and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped by on Saturday night before we went to a concert at T-Mobile Arena.    We love sitting at the bar, as that is where all the fun people are.  The bartender was excellent and made a wonderful suggestions and drinks.    We just had four/five \"small plates,\" tapas style.  Everything was tasty, well presented, and well made.    We will come back."}
{"text":"had a very nice breakfast here yesterday. ordered the breakfast platter and their specialty made pop tart. the presentation and flavors were good as well as the preparation of them. also liked the decor of the restaurant. our server took good care of us as well. i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon avocado burger and garlic fries. The food was mildly warm. The fries did not taste like garlic and my burger was missing avocado. Top it off they still charged me for the avocado and never offered to remove it from the bill. We had to ask them to make the adjustment. Service was mediocre. No refill on coffee but water they did refill. We will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Glad I stoped here everything was so delicious. From drinks to brunch  platter and garlic fries that I had to reorder 2 times. Very good and friendly waiters. Environment was fun they had music playing loud."}
{"text":"How did this place even get 4.5 stars? Tom's Urban serves terrible and overpriced food. Stick with Shake Shack next door."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. They have these small spot lights above that a blinding me. As for food, I got the Urban breakfast and I literally got two small strips of bacon. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Meh, in a word, that's what I'd tell people about Toms Urban. It's cheaper to stay at the Mandarin, than it is to drink at Toms Urban. Ask for the hangover slopper anything but well done and you'll get it, WELL DONE. I mean it was an insult to beef everywhere to call that burger medium. The cowboy calamari was good the sauces were better. The service was on the slower side and drinks did stay empty for a few minutes. I get that it's a strip restaurant but the food has plenty of room for improvement. So meh, Toms Urban, you most definitely were not worth my money."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, had to try it.  It was close to our hotel, MGM Signature.  Reminds me kind of  Eureka! restaurant, a chain in California.  I had the Vindaloo tacos and my husband had buffalo chicken sliders.   Both were delish.   My only very minor complaint was the wine list wasn't good at all.  The only chard they had was Talbot which isn't my fav.  Also, my tacos were lukewarm like they were sitting out for awhile. Service was great.  Will come again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great rustic urban atmosphere at NYNY in Las Vegas.  We tried the duck wings, which were get out of town good, and the cold lobster sliders, also equally amazing.  My husband found an IPA and a DBA on the beer list that he really liked, but I went with one of their Rum infused shakes (the salted caramel one).  AMAZING!  This was a quick stop in to snack, but I am interested in returning for a meal.  The only negative was since we were in at an off our (which really shouldn't exist in Vegas) the service wasn't the best, but not enough to ruin our meal."}
{"text":"Typical Las Vegas \"open late\" Las Vegas hotel restaurant with everything including the kitchen sink on the menu.  The menu is huge and every item has some sort of twist to it.  Twists are cool when they are seldom, sometimes you just want regular recipes.  With such a big menu and being very hungry I was surprised how long it look me to find something that sounded good to me.  I finally did though.  I got the buffalo chicken sliders and my date got the all American sliders.  She liked hers and I liked mine but there was nothing standout about them.  My fries were a bit flavorless though and definitely lukewarm.  The waiter was good and prompt and the meal definitely wasn't bad, it was just average, as the amount of stars given suggests."}
{"text":"My beautiful Canadian-ish homegirl and I were walking around the strip trying to find a place for brunch.   I suggested Tom's Urban because my hubby and I walked by it the night prior when we walked over to shake shack.  Tom's urban's location is great, right on the strip, patio, with lots of people watching from every corner.  We were seated in a nice spot where we were able to enjoy the music and watch the hungovers make their way around vegas.  At the time we went, around 1030a, the whole menu was available which made it difficult to choose a meal.  She's vegetarian though, so it does help with narrowing our options.  We decided to share the veggie omelet which came with toast and hashbrowns. And we also ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes. Our dishes came fairly quickly and those plates were huge--definitely meant for sharing.  Our omelet was full of veggies and nicely cooked. I especially liked that it wasn't greasy like many omelets can be. The potatoes and toast were also awesome sides.    I think my friend and I would agree, however, that the star of that meal was the plate of pancakes. Those pancakes were light, very fluffy and very tasty even without the butter or syrup.  At some point, we were just picking at the pancakes!!   So good. so good."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban lovin' in Vegas.~   Impressive restaurant just like the the one at LA Live!! Our server gave fantastic service and was on top of everything. We opted for the outdoor front patio dining which was nice even on the warm scorching Memorial Day I was here. I ordered the *Gigante Breakfast Cuban* which has carnitas, ham, hash browns, fried eggs, swiss cheese, yellow mustard, pickled onion, inside of the butter-toasted sourdough and I got the shoestring garlic fries. Filling and amazing breakfast sandwich as the name says it all.. so yummy!! I also opted for the unlimited mimosas at an extra charge. Drinks kept flowing, food was delicious, and overall it was a wonderful summery perfect holiday when I brunched at Tom's.;D"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and fun. Perfect way to start a Sunday Funday.. They have bottomless mimosas and they mean it."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and brunch during our trip and enjoyed the food both times.  For dinner, we had the Ginger Chicken Potstickers, a burger, and the BLT Lobster Roll (this was my favorite!).  We were happy with the food so we came back for brunch a different day, where we had the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake (spicy) and the Beach Bum omelet sandwich.  All were delicious and portions were large!  Prices are extremely fair.  One star off for slow service.  Both times we were there it wasn't busy, but it took awhile for someone to come over to take our orders, to receive our food, and to get the check.  I had to flag someone down to come to our table, and the dining experience was more drawn out than it should be."}
{"text":"We freaking love Ashley she is the best.  Love this place and service is tops. My husband and I strolled in and were sort pleased with our drinks and food.  Well be back for dinner hope Ashley is still here"}
{"text":"Were not courteous when we wanted to sit in a different spot then in a corner with no views of the strip or televisions.    Brussels sprouts had no seasoning or flavor.  It seems like they forgot salt or garlic while preparing them.    Chopped salad was not very tasteful at all.  It seemed very bland.  The size was good but the taste should come with the size.    The arugula and mushroom and truffle pizza was blah.   I was looking forward to a nice size pizza and it was small with no flavor.   Again no seasoning.     Michael the waiter was awesome.  Very personable and funny.     Shawn the waiter was very plain and boring.   No personality.    And no manager acknowledged our disappointment in the food.  It really felt like no one cares about us and how our food was."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere, awesome service and amazing food! We are here with kids so it's great to have a place with lots of casual options but still offer for a sophisticated palate and our server Eddie rocked with suggestions and service. Extensive beer menu and lots of TVS to enjoy March Madness too! It's a win all-around."}
{"text":"This is a small chain restaurant (been to the location in Denver) with ample seating and a wide variety of offerings on the menu located inside New York, New York. If you're looking for a spot with decent food in large portions, this is your spot. They do everything well-- but nothing is finger-lickin good where you dream about one bite of that speciality entree for months to come.   We came here for brunch and I ordered the Beach Bum omelette, which was pretty tasty... wish I it was topped with more than 3 slices of avocado, though. It also came with sides of toast and hash browns. This dish could definitely serve 2! Hash browns were a bit mediocre (lukewarm and unseasoned) but not enough to get me riled up. Overall, a good place with quick service. Only complaint I have is that for such a large place, the bathrooms are single occupancy for each gender, so lines can get long!   Service: 5/5 Ambience: 4/5  Pricing: 5/5"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! We came for breakfast and it was really good. I had the tree hugger with bacon...the avacado was amazing and everything else was perfect. The cheese grits were the best I have had. The staff was friendly and the drinks were great. I highly recommend coming here no disappointments."}
{"text":"Good god! Doesn't matter what you get here, it is all amazingly delicious. Ginger Chicken Potstickers were to die for, mini Mac and cheese was great (has pork and chili in it), ribs were bomb and the cheesesteak was out of this world. Do yourselves a favor and just eat here!!"}
{"text":"I visited this location today for lunch with my wife because we were intrigued by the outdoor deck and the interesting menu.   Beyond the cool decor and deck I am not impressed and here's why: I ordered the hummus plate and kale romaine side salad. At first glance everything looked great until I realized every piece of baby kale was yellow, limp, and spotted. I never return food but there was no way I was paying for a salad only to pick half of the greens out. Kale looks like that after 2 weeks in the fridge - gross! The vegetable issues didn't stop there, unfortunately. Every piece of celery and carrot on my humans plate was dry, cracking, and had clearly been cut days ago and stored. Any good chef or kitchen manager knows if you cut celery and carrots in advance they need to be stored in water. Come on, Tom's Urban.   My wife did enjoy the flavors of her cornbread pancake and spicy fried chicken, but I wouldn't recommend trusting any of the fresh items at this restaurant as they seem to think it's ok to serve produce that should have been in the garbage weeks ago."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! The best hash browns I've ever had to be exact. The servers here are amazing and very friendly. Def recommended this spot to all!"}
{"text":"I give this place no stars! We walked in and promptly seated with no hello and no water. The servers that were working saw us and didn't acknowledge us. We waited 15 min before I acknowledged them. The customer services at this restaurant is not of good quality! They need help."}
{"text":"Our dinner consisted of a rum and diet, a 22 ounce Coors light, a pepperoni Pizza, garlic fries, chicken adobo street tacos.  The pizza was great! The garlic fries were lacking garlic as in next to nothing. The adobo had no adobo flavor that I was used to having spent time in the Philippines.   Now for the real surprise......that 22 ounce draft Coors light cost me $10. Come on man, that's ridiculous.   I would probably not go there again.   My rating of 3 is generous because of the pizza"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but our server was so nice and very quick. I split a pizza and 50/50 fries. ..both were really good. Price want too bad either.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible service.   We were seated at our table and it took maybe 10 minutes before a waitress even came to our table. It took forever for her to finally bring out waters and coffee -- almost as long as our meal, and then she forgot to bring out cream/sugar and we were almost done our meals by the time we were able to flag her down. We didn't have utensils -- which seemed to be happening to several other customers --  and since our waitress was nowhere to be found, I had to go find another waitress. I politely asked for utensils and she barely even acknowledged me and had an annoyed look on her face. I could maybe understand this type of service if the restaurant was really busy and understaffed, but it didn't appear that way.  After eating, we noticed that the container on our table that held our utensils had some disgusting, dried up fries stuck to the bottom of it. So we realized we had ate off of the forks that were placed on top of that.  There were birds flying around inside the restaurant, and eating off of the floor, which I didn't really mind since it was kind of entertaining, but I'm sure other customers weren't as happy when they were flapping above their tables.  Overall, would probably be 4 stars with better service and cleanliness, because the food was good and decently priced for The Strip."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch around Noon on a rainy Sunday. There was no wait, so we were seated immediately. We attributed that to the restaurant being very new.  The decor of the restaurant is awesome. It's immediately apparent a lot of thought and money has gone into designing a space that's comfortable and fun. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the foods on their menu.  We ordered the Crispy Duck Wings, Ginger Chicken Pot Stickers, \"Sticky\" Belly Steamed Buns and the Carnitas Cuban Sandwich. Although on the pricey side, their food is definitely flavorful. We really enjoyed all of the dishes. Only the duck wings gave us a slight pause. The wings were good, but I would have liked to have been able to taste the duck a little bit more. The sauce was somewhat overpowering. But overall, an excellent culinary experience."}
{"text":"We ate brunch here in a Sunday. I have pretty high expectations for brunch and love my brunch places in Denver. Despite being directly on the strip, the food was really tasty and we ate it all and talked about it the rest of the day."}
{"text":"The salad was wonderful, but do not, I repeat do not, order the low cal coconut water cocktail, especially do not order a double. The drink was allegedly a double but contained no alcohol... wasn't trying to get drunk or anything ... I'm a lightweight, if I have one glass of wine I feel it. So I thought maybe the drink was alcohol free but for $22 absolutely not worth it. You have been warned. I know it's Vegas, but I still feel ripped off.  ***** Update: thank you for your kind response, I will absolutely take you up on your offer! Like a lot of people, I hate to complain about a unique drink, maybe others like it like this- who knows, maybe it's low cal because the alcohol is very light, not like a regular drink. Anyway- thanks and Hope to see you soon. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the perfect opportunity to come back to Tom's Urban after my yelp experience with family in town visiting from the 808. We were looking for somewhere close since they were staying at Excalibur Hotel. I mentioned Tom's Urban. It great spot for family dining open area, diverse menu (even have kids menu), and something that don't see back in 808. It just walk across the street. So they were down for it. I was excited go back not that I never got my fix in or tasted enough of the menu. It always good idea go back after yelp event get honest opinion minus all the special treatment.   Me I would give it 4.5 star review. The ambience was the same vibe one that really enjoy the spacious dining room, my niece and nephews LOVED that fact had wide screens all spread out in the restaurant (one that was playing music videos; yup like they even made music videos anymore!?!?!?), so keep the kids interested cause late at night they were fading from long day of soccer tournament day, and the wood decor is awesome more so when understand the history behind it. Our server not sure if she worked the yelp event looked familiar. She was awesome, love the excitement she brings to her job, friendly, passionate, upbeat, free spirit, professional, and interactive with the kids. She notice my nephew soccer warm up jacket and was asking if they were here for soccer tournament. She plays soccer herself and was telling us about tournament she went down to AZ of recently or something. The bottom line was love the interaction she engaged with us. It make the whole experience that much more memorable plus she is very professional. We never had empty glasses answered all of my family questions since was their first time, and was on it.   Food I ended up going with familiar dish one that had at yelp event. I went with the street tacos. I went with three combination of pork belly and two al carbon. You can order one, two, three, or all five different ones. That was way too much food. It was delicious. It tasted just as good as just few days prior at yelp event. My family visiting they had couple of pizzas, grilled cheese, and chicken fingers. They all enjoyed their food. The only thing would say is the chicken fingers not that eye appealing but then again plain old chicken fingers.   The only reason fell short of yelp perfection was we must have been the only people at the restaurant. We got there late around 10pm surprise for Saturday night kind of empty. We got seated fast, server she was prompt, awesome, and on it. Once she put the order in no fault of hers took over thirty minutes. I could understand if was swamped but the place was empty. Anyway long day we were all starving so might have been short but we left the restaurant past 11pm. Server apologize. It nothing that would stop me from coming back or bringing out of town visitors for some of the ono grinds."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner because it was one of the few well rated places close to the mgm where we were staying that wasn't more than $$. Overall, my group of 8 was extremely satisfied; every one of our 8 food dishes was awesome. I personally had a turkey club that was delicious; I did not know a club sandwich could taste so good. Other notable dishes were the lobster mac n cheese, the canitas sandwich, and the big ass eggroll. Our waitress was super friendly and made sure we had a good time. It is also worth noting the prices were below most other hotel restaurants as well. I think Tom's Urban is a great choice if you are looking for great, affordable food on the strip."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!  Spicy edamame, crispy Brussel sprouts and potstickers were all highlights.  Fun atmosphere!  Think funky, upscale dinner with cocktails.  Huge menu.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to recap your vegas night out with your friends. Grab a patio table, order a bloody Mary & enjoy some perfect bar food while reminiscing about last nights events.   Located at a prime spot street view outside the NYNY its draws you and with its unique entrees you become curious.  Enjoyed an evening dinner here after stumbling upon it while walking around started with a drink. I started with the peach Cosmo which was a bit disappointing because it tasted more like lemon than peach. It wasn't too sweet though so that was a plus. Next the Bellini, not a drink I would ever order again. Its usually made with champagne but they use sparkling white wine. It was way too sweet for me to finish. Lastly the gin and juice was awesome, the muddled strawberries and cucumbers were a great added touch.   The pork rib sliders served with fried onion rings came out and looked pretty cool. Truffle oil, arugula and mushroom pizza was good! Lots of truffle oil, yummy! Cripsy brussel sprouts. Must try!!   Definitely recommend sitting on the patio if its not too hot.  I see this place more for a group gathering and catch up spot with friends, not so much a romantic or date night.   Service was average at best. A manager stopped by and checked on us but our server was not so easy to locate at time. Nonetheless, the service was average."}
{"text":"I haven't even been but I have a complete lack of enthusiasm to try after today's phone conversation. Spoke with 2 people and no one could tell me about the menu when I inquired about gluten free dining. They didn't even know if the French fries were safe and \"maybe\" they had 1-2 items available. I would have come in if I had a for sure answer. I don't require a wide range of items, but I don't  and want to risk it on a \"maybe\" and get sick because no one knows what they're talking about. Food allergies are pretty prevalent in today's world, and it's a bit shocking that you guys aren't training staff on keeping patrons safe. Have 1 or 2 items that are FOR SURE safe, and you'll get my business."}
{"text":"We are here twice during our stay. The service was great! Food was great! I had the breakfast burrito and the green chili was delicious a little spicy but very very authentic and savory! We also ordered unlimited Mimosas!! I don't like the fact that they serve in glasses premade would've been better had they just brought the wine and orange juice to the table and let us serve ourselves!  We also ordered the hangover burger and my boyfriend ate it so fast! It taste amazing! We were able to have a good meal and watch soccer at the same time! Every seat pretty much has access to watch the television!"}
{"text":"great atmosphere and great food.  i love comming here when we visit vegas. our server eddie was awesome.  he was very friendly and very responsive to our needs."}
{"text":"I am a local... This is my second time eating here... The first time, the food was great, however it took 40 minutes to get my meal and the server seemed a little, over whelmed. This time however, the food(Steak Nachos and lobster Shrimp Tacos) was still impeccable, without the 40 minute wait. We had the added bonus of having Charles(the server)  who was awesome. He noticed that he had about 4 or 5 other tables. However, he treated us like we were his only customers. Quite a contrast from before. The manager stopped by and was very nice and funny. I don't remember his name. But, he was a good looking guy with silver hair. Over all I would recommend this place to anyone! Especially after this last experience."}
{"text":"The beer and pickle chips were awesome! The bartender in the smaller bar had the personality of a rock. I don't know his name but we were there on 6/20, around 2:00, and he never asked how we are doing or would we like something else. He seemed bothered to talk to us at all! Not great customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst costumer service I have ever had... we walked up this morning to get a table and the hostess asked us if we had a reservation and we told her no. She said \" Its Saturday sweetie you can't go to brunch in Vegas without a reservation, we don't have any tables available\". We could clearly see there was about five tables open right behind her and she didn't ask or offer to put our name on the a list. She just said there was no tables... I will never go back to that place after this. Seriously so rude."}
{"text":"Pros:  - The location is great for people watching (assuming you are on the patio) - The bar tenders and wait staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful - The menu has a variety of choices  Cons: - The actual food itself (at least what I tried)  I had the Prime Rib Sliders and they were so overloaded with grease and cheese that by the time I had 1/2 of my first slider, the bottom buns for all three had disintegrated.  I was eating sliders with a fork!   Sliders!   You know... those hand held bite size sandwiches?   I stubbornly ate the meat, but I kinda regretted that when all the salt and slime hit my gut.   No bueno.  However... I had a plan.   I saw a S'mores brownie/ cookie dessert that would save the day.   Right?   Wrong!   There isn't a brownie OR cookie to be found in there.   That dang thing (pictured) is a chocolate and marshmallow dip.   If I had made it for a party, people would dip their graham crackers, have two to three dips, and it would be a winner.   As a dessert, it is just a big pile of goo.   If you have read any of my other reviews I love love love my sweets, but this was just silly.  It was sweet, but in the way of squirtin Hershey's syrup straight into your mouth Sweet.   That's not a dessert.  That's a topping.    5 Stars for the location and staff 1 Star for the food"}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Vegas Knights game, so we were there for a few hours. We sat outside which was nice, we got to see the pregame festivities coming by. Our server was pretty terrible. Anytime we needed anything we would have to flag her down. She would come out to bring food to one table & not check on any of her other tables. We started with a few small items, then we ordered a pizza. We wanted black olives on it, but we were told that they do not have them, no worries. When the pizza was brought out by someone other than our server, we asked him for Parmesan & red pepper, he seemed a little bothered by that & replied \"give me a minute\". Well after 10 minutes I just ate the pizza without it. When I saw him walk by later I said \"you never brought us our Parmesan & red pepper flakes\".  His reply was \"oh I told you're server to bring them to you\" & he turned around. No apology, no accepting any sort of responsibility, nothing. I've never had a server respond to me in that manner. I will never be back & would definitely not recommend anyone to go here. Oh also, one of the other problems is there is only ONE men's & ONE women's single stall bathroom for the whole restaurant!!! Ridiculous, I don't even see how that is legal!"}
{"text":"The Figgy Piggy dinner sandwich may be the best sandwich I've ever had. Order it and thank me later. Go with the lemon rosemary tater tots with lemon aoli for the side- they were hot, crispy, and also nom-nom. Huge drink selection. The Tom's Cupp cocktail was refreshing. Nice meal."}
{"text":"Tom's is not absolutely amazing. Just fairly good.  If you can make the \"progressive\" (or regressive) happy hour, it's worth it. The main downside is that it can get very loud inside and hard to talk with your friends. We have tried several of the small bites that were on happy hour and all were very good. The drinks are good but not great. I think they cut back on the alcohol during happy hour, but who doesn't.  Sit at the bar for faster service. The patio is nice for people watching. Best for dine and dash.  Damn, I swore I would not write a review with the words amazing or absolutely in it. /s"}
{"text":"Still the best place to come! Thank you to Victoria, Stephanie, Kyler, and Bleu! You made our vacation great!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Awesome location. Love the indoor/outdoor options. Super urban industrial interior, unique seating and crafted decor. The small plates are great! Check in on Yelp for free Brussels sprouts! MUST try the fried chicken on cornbread pancake-it's to die for!!!! Seriously I don't ever order dishes like that, but I'm so glad I did it was that good. Service was great also. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Writing my review while here because the service is so damn poor I have time.  Note:  the place is maybe 50% full.   I like the music playing.  The table wobbles big-time, we are outside.   No other tables not reserved.  Hope the food is good, I'll let you know.   This waiters tip is hovering at 15%.   I usually to 20 and more for exceptional service.     I  had to ask for more coffee as he was walking by.  He appeared perturbed.   This may become a battle of wits.  Going to try and piss him off.   ( I just showed what I've written so far to Janet, she gave me one of those looks husbands get when we aren't behaving).  Well the food arrived and looked wonderful.   Mine was not room temperature.  It was actually cold!!   I had eggs Benedict and the ham was not heated in any way.   Told the manager.  Janet's was room temperature but we are starved. She ate.  Mine went back. I never send back. Let's see if I'm charged and more importantly, how it tastes. Waiting for coffee and food. Been here 40 minutes so far.  Lol. It came out over cooked. Muffin not toasted See photos! Now 50 min here.  No check. Good thing.  One star cause I had to."}
{"text":"Tom's urban is our late night go to. The people watching on the Patio is second to none. The menu has a good selection so no matter who is hanging out, everyone can find something on the menu. It is a little pricy for some of the more common menu items , but the LARGE souvenir drinks help you feel like you've got your money's worth. The lobster rolls and sliders seem to be what we always go to. Been 10+ times and service / food has always been great!"}
{"text":"Great casual place for urban atmosphere with a good bacon Bloody Mary with awesome Carnitas Verde Mac n Cheese! Great eclectic menu. Say hi to Natalie who is awesome. Music videos add to the ambiance."}
{"text":"This place seems good, but our personal experience was meh.   We were relieved to find a place that offered a menu with more variety than just late night, greasy fast food. We were hungry & wanted to enjoy our first meal in Vegas.  We ordered a shrimp salad, duck wings & burger to share.  The salad came out first. We started eating it and realized it was all just leaves. We waited around for our waitress for approx 10 min & ended up flagging down another restaurant employee before she returned. We complained that there we shrimps to be found in the salad... He apologized and went to pass on the message.   6-8 shrimps show separately on a mini plate about 5 min later. The salad was made up of leaves, dressing and basic shrimp. Definitely a disappointment & really nothing to write home about.   The duck wings were the highlight. They were delicious. Crunchy, sweet & tangy! They are on the pricey side @ $14 for 4 & I am not a huge fan of the mound of raw cabbage they laid on. The flavors were amazing. This owns a star rating in itself.   The portobello burger was meh. The cheese was melted into some rubbery plastic inedible texture.. The mushroom and buns were dried out.  The fries were good! We enjoyed those - the sweet potato and garlic fries each came with their own \"Caribbean\" and \"Mediterranean\" ketchup dips, which were fantastic.   I think it really comes down to what you order.. I wouldn't return unless it were for their duck wings and fries."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends who were visiting from Georgia. We stopped in for lunch around 1:15. Our server Andrea seated is immediately in a comfortable booth, and got our drink orders. She brought our drinks immediately and got our food orders, making some recommendations. My friend T ordered a cuban and a kale side salad, and his wife E had the all American burger with regular fries. I got the Urban Chopped salad. Our food came out quickly, and our server was extremely attentive and friendly - I can't recall the last time I had such an excellent customer service experience dining on the strip.   My friends realized they had actually been there twice already during their visit but had eaten outside on the patio. They mentioned this to the server, and the manager Renzo even stopped over to thank them for their return visits - as he pointed out, there are so many choices in the area, it's a pretty big testament to food and service for someone on vacation to come back 3 times in a week!!  My salad was excellent! I live in the NW part of town and would venture back just for the salad! Such a great mix of flavors and textures. My friends really enjoyed their meals also! Since the lunch rush had cleared out, they paid and lingered to visit, and Andrea went above and beyond to still check on us, and offer us fresh water. It was an excellent meal, excellent service, and I will definitely be back....soon!"}
{"text":"Cute enough space to chill and watch the game. I came here for dinner and got the carnitas tacos which were decent for bar food but not great. I also ordered the kick ass cactus cocktail (I think it's called that) which was good but presentation was a little lacking. Still decent enough place and the bartenders were pretty attentative"}
{"text":"Love the décor and the vibe.  What I really love is the salted caramel French toast and the cheddar polenta grits.  Friends had the huevos rancheros and a salad.  They enjoyed their meals as well.  Really a nice spot in NYNY."}
{"text":"So this was \"follow up review\" month for me and I was certainly more than obliged to pick out Tom's Urban to make the cut since it has been a bit, but LONG overdue!  I first wanted to send out an immense thank you to two individuals who really took it upon themselves to leave the jaws of both myself and my wife's just floored with each visit since our original visit: Mr. Erron Halen (the general manager) and Dylan Taucer (group sales & marketing). Over time I guess we have gone enough to the point where we are commonly recognized by Erron and out of the thousands that come to Vegas standing out in THAT crowd is priceless and certainly a genuine thing that one can't fake. We have made Tom's Urban an annual wedding anniversary meal and after the recent visit for our 8th year he came over personally and chatted it up while I'm sure he had a million things going on and that warmed the hearts of the both of us. As for Dylan, he certainly displays why he is in the position that he's in and I'd rate him 20 stars if I could. Hands down though the level of professionalism and overall hospitality from both of them personally and with an extension to the staff we have grown to know is mind blowing. This Tom's Urban is a VERY VERY special thing that NYNY has going!  It is Yelp however and how about we touch on some of the recent findings here shall we? Your taste buds will no doubt be your best friend if ya did!  Apparently with the check in now they offer either brussels sprouts or fried pickles which was new, but I highly recommend the brussels sprouts. It'll surely make Mama proud to see you eating your vegetables and LOVING it?!? Only in Vegas. Ha-ha! While the tenderness of the veggies were appreciated what really made it pop was the asian vinaigrette. There was a pinch of it being pampered in soy sauce almost, but then there is a sweetened after taste which is to die for.  Since it was my anniversary and all nothing screamed celebration more than their 16oz NYNY Strip. In a theoretical sense I wish I could've kissed the cook that night because the seasoning on that partnered with medium rare perfection was on point! It was just enough \"moo\" to coat the tummy happily, but not too much to miss out on their famous dessert menu.   Now speaking of that segway, I now have a guiltier than sin (no pun intended), their pineapple upside down cake. Even as I type this I can STILL taste it time and time again. By far this is the best I have ever had and I'm no doubt spoiled for life, but then again I haven't ordered one anywhere since and won't. Ha-ha. What knocks me upside the head is the moistness of the cake itself. Each bite melts away and crumbles in your mouth like golden chunks of heaven. What also gets me every time is the caramelized brown sugar. I literally have tuned out the noise of the restaurant and my wife even until I finish with the last bite. She just laughs, but I swear I could take a whole cake home. Is that offered, \"Tom\"?!?    I could go on for ages, but all good things must come to an end. I am very humble and places like these especially in the times we live in are rare finds. They have treated me well over the years dining with them and that genuine compassion is what keeps us coming back. Well yeah can't forget the ever evolving menu of deliciousness as well, but you know what I mean. Leaving with a smile and a full stomach is a job well done and a job they've perfected!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great music and atmosphere! Second time here and will come back every time we come to vegas!"}
{"text":"Had an extremely pleasant experience. Ortal and Sean we're both very personable in providing exceptional service at the Las Vegas locations. My girl and I both got burgers that were made to order and arrived almost immediately. Compliments to the chef in preparing the food as the taste and presentation were exceptional. Almost the second we sat we were able to order drinks and have them delivered promptly. Their attentiveness and timeliness was above and beyond expectations. This made for excellent hospitality. Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family! Thank you again for a great experience! Definitely recommend if you are in Vegas. If the weather is great, outside is a must!"}
{"text":"This place looks great, but no one who works there really cares about anything.  Sunday: breakfast over at 11:00am (boo, no brunch)   Food: took long which would have been ok, IF our food was made correctly. It wasn't. Both burgers were cooked Rare instead of Medium. Also, they brought out the wrong burger to my friend all together... Or rather put on extra condiments that weren't listed on the menu. My mini Mac and cheese was a little soupy, tasted ok. I will say the Garlic Fries were really really good. Pizza was greasy and not crisp. You gotta be fast, or you gotta be good. --- neither happened for us today. Wasn't cheap either!   Our server was kind of a d-bag the manager wasn't too friendly. But the hostesses and food runners were helpful.  **Update** The manager tells me they are open for breakfast all day."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for my wife's birthday. We came across Tom's Urban as we were looking for a place for dinner. We were seated immediately and found the atmosphere upbeat and fun. The table we were seated at gave us a great vantage of the entire place. I had the chimmichurri steak and stick fries, which was beyond delicious. With so many beer choices, it was hard to stick to just one. We had a great time and an awesome meal. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"Came here hoping for some good breakfast food before our flight back home to San Diego. I ordered the three piglets and my boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict. I asked for mushrooms in my omelet, didn't get it. The worst was when my boyfriend cut open the egg on top of the eggs Benedict and was hoping for a nice runny egg to ooze over, that didn't happen either. I called the waiter over and told him about my mushrooms and how the egg didn't run on the Benedict, he told me \"sometimes the egg gets cooked a little longer and sometimes, they don't run.\" Didn't say anything about my mushrooms, okay that's fine.   We go on and my boyfriend looked very disappointed. The manager came back and told us he'll give us a discount. Wanted to stop him and say no thanks, take the food back instead. But hey, at least they acknowledged us. He came back with a whomping $4 off?! So I'm paying like $7 for a piece of bread and ham. Worst part is. He finished about half and threw away the rest because the egg was supposed to be the best part. Should've ordered something else. And the coffee cup and utensils were stained and dirty. Something about this place... 4 stars? When they can't even make a signature eggs Benedict. Should've went to Cocos or Dennys, or hey, even McDonald's would've sufficed."}
{"text":"Great food, great selection of beers on tap.  Perfect place before TMobile arena show. Tacos are served in corn tortillas or lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"Jamie was the fricken coolest bar tender EVER!!!! Seriously she made my night last Tuesday when she suggested the duck wings ... My life changed forever!!! She was very friendly, funny and conversational as well as professional. I will be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas and I hope she is working!   Completely impressed with the service I received.   - Miguel gauthier"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! They have a really great menu, location, atmosphere, and ambiance. I will definitely be coming back. They do all day breakfast, and they have some of the best pancakes I've EVER had. They serve them with salted caramel butter, and that makes all the difference in the world. It was a great experience for not too much money, especially for Las Vegas. Service is quick, and their pomegranate-lime iced tea is a fabulous way to start the day!"}
{"text":"The drinks were alright didn't really all the birds flying over my head while I'm trying to eat everybody's different probably wouldn't go here again though the Brusselsprouts might have been good if it had  some seasoning"}
{"text":"Food was incredible. Service was top notch. Above average beer selection! Menu was full of great food and pricing wasn't bad for the strip."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place in Las Vegas.  It is located in NYNY hotel but has an outside entrance and a lot of on strip outside eating. We chose to sit inside seeing as it was 114 degrees out. The inside is big and very modern. The restaurant was very clean. Our waiter was a very nice guy, he was attentive but not bothersome. I got the Buffalo chicken sliders and the cheesy grits on the side. The person I was with got a prime rib sandwich with fries. My food was delicious. I will say that if you do not like extremely hot food, I would not get the Buffalo sliders. They were hot but very good. The cheesy grits........ delicious. I could just eat a huge bowl of those!!!  My co worker said that the prime rib sandwich was one of the best sandwiches in general he has ever had. Now on to dessert..... the pineapple upside down cake..... yum yum yum!!  I will definitely be back to this restaurant next time I am in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Get the pizza! Seriously though, get the pizza - so freaking bomb! Pair it up with a mojito, yea baby yea"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is the perfect cure for any hangover. Our waitress Kellie was FANTASTIC!! Must go here when you're in town."}
{"text":"We were out on the strip looking for a place to eat and happened upon Tom's Urban by chance. Turned out to be one of the best meals we've had in Vegas! The food was all delicious and the portions were extremely generous. We will definitely be returning to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was so good.  Worth the money.  We sat at the bar had a few drinks.  The bartenders were very nice.  The fried pickles were delicious.  I had a huevos Benedicto and it was soooooooo good.  I demolished it lol!  So flavorful! I look forward to coming back to Vegas so this yummy food."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast the omelet and jam with the toast was unbelievable. I have been coming to Vegas for years eating breakfast all over and by far this is the best. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My summer fishing buddy back on Cape Cod in 1976 was named Tom. This was the summer after Jaws took the world by storm, so the vibe on the Cape at that time was surreal. I'd liken it to San Francisco just 7 years prior but I wasn't there at the time (Vietnam). Anyway Tom and I spent a lot of time out on this little schooner in '76 tossing back beers and talking about fishing, about the war, and about bathrooms. Typical guy stuff. Tom would join Gloria and I at Seafood Sam's for fried clams (decent bathrooms there). After the summer of '76 Tom kind of dropped off the map. We didn't have the Facebooks back then so it's not like we could easily stay in touch. The only Tweeters we had were on our quadraphonic sound system loudspeakers :)  I like to think maybe Tom moved out west and started his own restaurant chain. Typical American pub fare with beers and whatnot. Called it Tom's Urban. Turns out this Tom's Urban was started by a guy named Tom who also has a company that makes really flat griddled hamburgers. That doesn't sound like my ex-Gunnery Sergeant turned fishing buddy Tom. Trust me, my Tom wouldn't make a bathroom as despicable as the one at Tom's Urban on the strip in Vegas. We spent too much time on that little schooner off the Cape talking BRs (bathrooms) for him to have designed the literal \"S\"-hole I discovered at Tom's Urban.  Being that I was in town for the Indoor Ag-Con this past April (the \"Are container farms economically viable for commercial production\" session was riveting!) I needed to eat somewhere on the Strip relatively close to the Convention Center. Some Con buddies of mine and I (fellow green thumbs) chose to unwind after a long day of Conning with the Tom's urban Happy Hour. We requested outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the Strip near New York New York Casino and Resort. Our request was initially denied, but after a table of tourists paid their bill we were offered a great corner table on the patio.  You'll want to ask your server the location of the bathroom upon being seated. You won't see much of her during service and the beer offerings are a bit watered down (I gave up Old Style years ago, I'm a Belgian Quad man now). The sprawling bar and restaurant requires a bit of a hike to get to the bathroom. But once you find it (walk to the back, turn this-a-way, then that-a-way) you're in for a shock.  Tom's Urban, with it's seemingly hundreds of dining tables, countertops and bar seats, has ONE single-use bathroom for men. So, like, if you chose Tom's Urban as your desired destination to watch the upcoming Super Bowl (2017) you'd probably be fighting hundreds of gentleman for the privilege of relieving yourself in ONE. SINGLE. TOILET.  For what it's worth, the bathroom was quite clean and orderly. Nice tiles. Aromas of pine and citrus, with only a touch of chemical acidity. A low seated toilet (which is passable because I didn't have to sit to do my business this time) with a push-button flusher (which I later found out was also automatic, but that's besides the point). The problem with the push-button flusher is that in most men's rooms the toilet seat is ALWAYS in the upright position. It's almost impossible (with paper towels or toilet paper in hand) to hit the push-button flusher without some portion of your hand hitting the upright toilet seat. GROSS. The sink features both hot and cold faucets, with the requisite foam-y soap dispenser (whether it was anti-bacterial or not I do not know) nearby. Once again - and it seems like I always have to say this - if you're going to offer the option of air dryers, which most of today's youth prefer to a good old fashioned paper towel - you can't only have a bathroom door that opens into the bathroom. How many people do you think wash and dry their hands only to soil them again pulling the door open to exit the bathroom with their bare hands? I'll tell you who WON'T ever make that mistake. Me.  Until we can find a restaurateur who is forward-thinking enough to design an ergonomically sound bathroom that caters to the person who wants to come in contact with the least amount of surfaces possible, deplorable bathrooms like those at Tom's Urban chain of fast casual restaurants will continue to proliferate.  The Nashville Hot Chicken was delightfully spicy. The \"XL\" size was more than enough for one human male. I heard the Boulder Club was \"okay\" but \"sloppy\". The beer selection left much to be desired. Guinness and Shock Top? C'mon Tom, get your act together. Maybe next time (if they fix the bathroom issues I experienced) I'll try the mac and cheese skillet. It looked tasty."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my sisters birthday. Miranda was our server and from the time we sat down until we were leaving she made us feel special! Even though she was busy with lots of other tables she didn't miss a beat. Joe the manager and Danielle even stopped by our table a couple times to check on us. Food on point service on point and even the bartenders were on point! Thanks for the alcoholic beverages Jeff and Ilan! Toms Urban you rock!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was super good! I had a create your own omelette and the most fabulous hash browns I have ever had. The rest of my party's breakfast looked pretty tasty too! Most definitely going to have to stop back by. The environment is fun too. They play great music. Who doesn't like to boogie in your seat?"}
{"text":"Great service and and the location can't be beat. The food especially at Happy Hour pricing is a steal!! Recommendation-the New Amsterdam Mules (order 2 at a time because they are GOOD!and the Banh Mi tacos skip the tortilla and go with a lettuce cup-trust me..."}
{"text":"We had a party of 14! The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us! Eddie, our waiter was so fabulous! We was friendly, timely and just super nice! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here twice while staying in Vegas. First time was pretty good... would have given 3 stars, nothing to write home about but decent food. Second time was awful... deserved 1 star so evened it out with two.  Service was extremely slow, orders were wrong or missing items. Eggs were still raw on the avocado Benedict. Hash browns were raw and still cold. Staff were too busy to correct the mistakes quickly. Perhaps a bad day... but this place seems very hot and miss. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday evening, and had no problem getting seated quickly on their patio.  The weather was perfect for outdoor dining, and the service was top notch.  I eat out regularly, and have rarely had a waiter as perfectly attentive (kept our waters filled without always being in the way).  He had a great drink recommendation for my friend who couldn't find what she was craving.  The food was also to die for.  The Figgy Piggy sandwich was deliciously unique (fig jam, brie and other cheeses grilled together), and my friends enjoyed their spicy cornmeal pancake with friend chicken and salads.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and they have a decent beer selection, but poor service brings down rating.  Came in with a reservation for 10+, all paying separately, but server refused to issue separate checks.  Service was fine up until food delivered, then server disappeared.   Were there for over 2 hours and several people had to leave cash and book it, before the server even came back so the check could be requested.  Prime rib sliders were delicious. Bottom buns were saturated with the gravy though; they'd be better if raised up and not sitting in the gravy.  I'd be back with a small party, but would avoid if you have a large group (unless you don't mind an even bill split)."}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Monday during Spring Break. The atmosphere is nice. We waited for an almost an hour for our food, and when they brought them out they didn't cook our burgers the way we wanted. We sent them back again and they got one of the two burgers right. When we finally got to eat the food did not disapppatiooint. I got the Korean BBQ and my friend got the Truffle Portabelo+Swiss. My burger was cooked just the way I wanted, and it was so juicy. Their garlic fries we're awesome, and their ketchup had the right amount of flavour! Due to the long wait and the problems with the kitchen, the manager came out, apologized and took care of the bill. Great food, and great service!"}
{"text":"Great place. We were looking for a place to have brunch and catch World Cup. Love the decor, super place for watching sports and enjoying brunch. We chose his place based on other Yelp reviews and menu.   I wish I could give a bette rating but....we ordered the Urban Bloody Marys and although tasty, the advertised fried jalapeños did not come and when asked our server informed us they did not have them. This is not enough to penalize by two stars but then came the food. Everyone ordered something different...my food came about 10 minutes after everyone else's. At our table was the Piggy Piggy...tasty but the toasted bread was a little burnt. I ordered the Crispy Chicken and Corn Pancake. Although my chicken was wonderfully crispy and spicy, the pancake was cold. .   Service was wonderful from the hostess station to our waitress. I would definitely say give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Second time, wonderful meal. Love this place. Some dishes are rather spicy, so order carefully. I like hot, spicy and it is sometimes too much for me. Consistently good."}
{"text":"Went at lunchtime on a Thursday. Waited a while to be seated, even though the place seemed moderately attended. Ordered our food....simple breakfast items....took 45 minutes to come, and the food was cold. We asked to have things heated, but it's hard to reheat pancakes, and we didn't have the patience to wait another 45 minutes. The prices are way too expensive for cold food that takes forever to get to you. Needless to say, not going back."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! The atmosphere is really great and I love the music videos they play while you wait for your food. Service is great!   Bacon avocado burger was AmAzing. Soo delicious and flavorful and the bread was perfectly toasted. Garlic fries are so yummy and taste like a provenzal.   Carnitas tacos were also extremely delicious and perfectly seasoned. Everything tasted so fresh!!Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely return!  PS - their chile habanero hot sauce is pretty flipping good. Just go easy with it for sure.  Thank you Tom!!"}
{"text":"I came. Was told \"I'll be there in a minute\" three times by the bartender. Then someone (not the bartender) came and took my order...a pop tart and potstickers. There aren't very many people here. The bartender then came back and asked again what we ordered. The food took forever. For two basic things when not busy. Almost walked out.  If you want a refill on water, don't come here."}
{"text":"I came in for happy hour with my wife before a show at T-Mobile. We sat at the bar and waited over 10mins to order drinks and a couple appetizers. They seemed to be really short staffed as there was 1 bartender for the whole crowded bar, plus she had to make drinks for the servers. The manager was trying to help her out as best as she could  but the service was still really slow. We ordered the steak nachos which were soggy and could have used a lot more steak for the price. We also got a couple tacos that were nothing special. We will probably go elsewhere for happy hour the next time we're down that way."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Monte Carlo and decided to try Toms Urban since it was right next door. We have eaten here 3 times in the last 3 days and everything was awesome. The prices are great. The cheesy hashbrowns, grits and pancakes were amazing. We will definitely be back.  Sami was great for breakfast this morning and Michael on the midnight shift was hilarious and very personable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and service! I've been here twice this weekend. There omelets and burgers with garlic fries are a must!"}
{"text":"Nothing negative to say, ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was so Delicious! And the lobster mac and cheese which was legit with big pieces of lobster. Also you gotta try the bloody Mary's they are to die for!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Made a reservation but it was a Monday night and didn't really need it. The server was super friendly and attentive. She filled our drinks constantly. I got the chicken and cornbread pancakes. It came out wrong initially but they were super quick to fix it. They gave us free dessert to make up for it which was amazing. The chicken was super moist. The pancake was ridiculously huge and awesome. I could have totally made a second meal out of this except that I had nowhere to put leftovers. My husband got the Cuban sandwich which was also pretty good. It was nothing super out of the ordinary but it tasted good and had everything I would have expected. The chocolate cake was to die for, even after it sat in my purse for several hours and got crushed a few times. They had some really interesting items on their menu and good happy hour specials. I'd like to go back and try more things. Also, their prices were really reasonable. We had two sodas and both meals for a little over $40."}
{"text":"Do you have the drunk munchies and are close by? Yes?! Well I'd say this is your place! My bf and I stopped by after gambling, drinking, and all that fun stuff on the strip.  We decided to come here mainly because it was close to us and we didn't feel like walking to far.  The menu also seemed promising and it was!  Our server was so nice and even talked to us for a bit about the restaurant. Wish I remembered his name!  From what he said the owner was the guy who owns smash burger so it pretty neat to try the new spin on things since we've had the burgers before.  We went for the 2 fries (regular and sweet potatoes), wings, and potstickers. Everything was pretty good and definitely hit the spot! I'd say sit in the patio the atmosphere is great and you get a nice view of the strip."}
{"text":"Nice waitress and good services. Very friendly and nice cool place and was open very early for some food"}
{"text":"After an unfortunate incident during our first visit to Tom's Urban, management reached out and apologized. For that I'm thankful. I really hope they had a talk with the bartender about her customer service skills and that nobody ever has to go through what I did.  With that being said, upon our return to Las Vegas last week, we paid Tom's Urban another visit suggested by upper management to give them another chance,  & boy oh  boy, what a change and a great change at that. Redemption is a good word to use. We were greeted by the hostess, met with management; might I add they apologized for last time and was served with excellence. They surely  righted a wrong and showed us what real customer service is. Our waitress Amberly (spelling) was on point, checked on us frequently, and made sure the libations and the H20 was flowing.  Excellent come back! Two yums up it is!"}
{"text":"Bad, just bad all around.  Went there for a quick bite before the show. Told bartender and she said no problem.  Orders right away and food took 30+ minutes for sliders, fries, and fried pickles.   Sliders: Burnt to a crisp, like eating charcoal briquettes. My girlfriend actually refused to eat them.   Fried Pickles: So salty we both couldn't stand them and I'm a put salt on everything person  Fries Basket: Not bad, but were served room temp"}
{"text":"Great food, and amazing service. The lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese is huge and so amazing! If you like Brussels sprouts you have to try these and the hummus too is great! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Our server Tim was amazing! Great drink reviews and was super fast and friendly. Would go to this place again for the great service and location. We were able to sit outside on a patio bar right on the strip."}
{"text":"This place has the most unique menu Ive seen. Great ambiance and vibe here. Service and food was exceptional. Nice selection of craft beer. Urban legend is a must when in vegas"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner with hubby and adult daughter.  Our cocktails were really good.  Daughter had the ultimate peach cosmo. I had a regular Cosmo,  Hubby had the usual Grey Goose martini.  We shared the duck wings and beef nachos based on recommendation from the waiter.  Both were delicious.  We also each had a kale romaine dinner salad.  It was really small. Could have used some tomatoes or carrot or something more than just the kale and romaine.   Tgexwaiter and the guy who brought the food  were attentive and helpful.  Service was fast."}
{"text":"Update - dinner was very good. Our server made a correction to keep us happy. Just had breakfast tree hugger Benedict- food was cold. Disappointing. Service was ok."}
{"text":"What a BIG EGGROLL!!! I can't believe I ate... the... whole... thing! Eddie was awesome serving up his menu knowledge and cold bubbly on a hot July day. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The customer service here is really lacking. We were left for many minutes after ordering drinks And asking for the check. I ordered a medium rare jalapeño burger. It came out mid-well. The second time it came out well done. The manager took off the burger, but after waiting as long as I did for three diff burgers, I would've comped a drink at Least. Upon delivering our check after it was swiped, we got not a Thank you or even any eye contact. Awful experience."}
{"text":"So happy to try a new place that exceeds my expectations! Butter poached Lobster and Shrimp tacos with Blue corn tortillas lightly fried. Great sauce brings out the best of the Shrimp and Lobster! Pressed Cuban sandwich was great !  Sticky Pork Belly buns were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while in Vegas. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away. Lots of TV's that had the football game on. Server was very nice and quick. I felt the meal was just ok. I ordered the club and it was dry. Barely any mayo on it. My husband felt the same about his sandwich and too much bread. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Very hipster atmosphere with reclaimed wood and metal accents. The food was pretty good. My mom and niece both loved their burgers. I'd eat there again, but nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere sitting on the \"Brooklyn Bridge.\" The drink prices are a little high, but not unusual on the strip.  The food was outstanding. I had the frog legs, which was a huge serving. Our server suggested trying a half and half order, where half were regular and half spicy.  Both were really good, but honestly I preferred the spicy.  I also highly recommend on the drink menu that you try the cactus ass kick."}
{"text":"Super disappointing... and adding that we are locals, and ventured out to the strip, I think it makes it even worse. This was actually our 3rd time here. 1st time was a horrible experience. My husband wrote a YELP review, and the manager reached out and apologized and urged us to try again. We did, and it was fantastic. Great service, great seats outdoor, delicious drinks and fantastic food. 2nd time, not even close. Never got the 2 waters we ordered, took over 15 mins to get a beer and margarita. Once our food finally came out, it was cold. Like ice cold. We asked for forks and knives two times and finally my husband got up and walked over to the stand and grabbed two himself. We are beginning to think that this is a great spot on a super low volume day. The first time we came with the awful experience, it was just before a concert. The second time was middle of the day on a Thursday, and everything was flawless. This last time was a total disaster. Super disappointing as we will be frequenting the T-Mobile area for many hockey games and would have loved to have this be \"our place\"...."}
{"text":"It took a long time for the food and when we received it it was cold :( nothing memorable. We got the steak nachos and the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese. The food was okay. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We came in for a late small plate lunch before hitting the strip. Great food, excellent house cocktails, and friendly service from Judy! My off-menu Bulleit Rye Old Fashioned was competently executed. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Not sure how the food is tho we went in for a burger. The menus were disgusting dirty. Tammys almost seemed like it had been tossed on. Got new ones and not much better so we drank our beers and left. If they can't take care of the upfront I couldn't imagine the kitchen. Too many great places in this town to settle for 3rd rate."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars.  The ESPN Sports Bar use to be here and they replaced it with this place.  I think it is an upgrade, food wise.  The food was actually good and the service was freindly and fast.  The wait to get in was a different story.  They told us half and hour and took twice as long.  When we finally got seated, we noticed it was only half full, so why did we have to wait?  When I bought this to their attention, they said they didn't have enough waiters.  First of all, it was the weekend.  What kind of place staffs half the waiter needs on the weekend?  Then it was March Madness, the busiest weekend of the entire year.  Boneheads.  One star for the dufus management and 3.5 stars for the good food and waiter."}
{"text":"Warm beer out of the draft is not what I'm looking for when it's 100 degrees outside. Our service here is what made me give it 2 stars and not 1 star. Our waitress here was awesome. The food was not. Over priced but it's New York New York right? Food wasn't that great and not worth it at all. I wish I could go back in time and not come here."}
{"text":"Okay, we were starving and the food was definitely edible. If you are looking for \"foo foo\" food this is the place for you. We both ordered tacos; mine were the carnitas and my husband ordered the asada. The meat was good but all the extra stuff was just a bit overboard on the flavors. Next time we will go back to DJ's taco bar in the Hawaiian Marketplace where the tacos are really good for the price."}
{"text":"Great service great food!! Here on New Year's Eve with a large party Cheryl was our waitress and amazing!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a steak salad, the steak was dry not tasty very pricey  very disappointed   never again"}
{"text":"Wanted to eat a late dinner at Nine Fine Irishmen but they were no longer serving food.  Just charging a cover charge to enter for drinks.  Ended up here and the hostess looked very bored at having to help us.  We were seated and tried to order off the happy hour menu.  We were told there are no happy hour specials on Friday night.  Makes sense but this wasn't obvious unless you scrutinized the menu (both tables next to us also tried to order off the happy hour menu).    Tried the CHIMICHURRI STEAK & FRITES*.  The frites were delicious and the chimichurri steak was okay.  Friend had the Philly cheesesteak dip and it looked bad.  Even the dipping sauce looked like thick gravy.  Service wasn't very friendly but it wasn't horrible.    Lots of TV's around playing sports and music videos to keep you entertained while you wait."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Tom's Urban. We were so excited because we go to the LA location all the time. The drinks were awesome! The edamame is always my fav! The bartender Ilan was the highlight of the night. Just a super nice guy that was attentive. I would totally come stay here at New York New York again just because it has a Tom's Urban with cool staff!"}
{"text":"Just okay. If you're in Vegas with all of the amazing dining options around, this should be on the bottom half of your list of places to eat.  However, if you're around and every other restaurant is too busy...you can get a decent meal here. Some of the best fried pickles.  But, their \"best ever pop tart,\" isn't really the BEST EVER.  I was full from lunch but felt compelled to order one to go.  I was excited to have it for a mid afternoon snack while at the airport.  Let's just say I was underwhelmed and disappointed by all the hype.  I would have been u h happier with a chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Ask for Nate!! He is an awesome waiter!! Bottomless mimosas kept coming without asking! Great service, fun times! Gotta buy the pop tarts!!"}
{"text":"Only commenting on the drinks. Bar service is fine and the bartenders were perfectly friendly so zero complaints there, but the drinks are a joke. Ordered a Moscow mule which was made fine, but selling this as a \"large\" is laughable. The mug is taller with a small circumference than normal so it's probably the same volume as any other Moscow mule. They need to just sell it as a regular because claiming it's \"large\" makes receiving the drink confusing by all stretches of the imagination."}
{"text":"3 thumbs up! We had breakfast here and decided on the build your own omelette.It was perfectly done with the sliced avocado placed decoratively on top and the hash browns had melted cheese .Add to it a generous helping of toast and it all looked and tasted awesome. The price was not cheap but normal for this type of place and this type of food.I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Tom's urban location several times with my husband, both with ourselves, with friends, and with our children and grandma.  Location is at the NYNY, so it's very convenient if you are staying at that particular casino, but also easily accessible from the exterior as well.  Each time we have been here, the food and service do not fail to disappoint, although I can say that a few times the service has been exceptional.    My husband and I like the patio because of the coolness factor (both figurative and literal).  They have lots of misters, and on the hot days they are refreshing and not too overpowering.  Also, you are right on the strip, just inside the casino's replica of the Brooklyn Bridge.   This makes for great people watching, and at nighttime you have a nice view of the twinkling lights,  and sometimes a little live music from a local musician posted up nearby.  On our most recent visit it was super hot,  so we opted for a semi-patio seat, which was cool, too.  It was a little funny because they tried to sit five of us at a small table for four, but that was quickly remedied by putting two tables together.   Over the several visits at this Tom's Urban location I have had breakfast, dinner, and appetizers and enjoyed all three.  What is helpful is that the menu is very descriptive, so read it thoroughly and ask questions.  The servers and kitchen are happy to make slight accommodations.  I have tried quite a few items but one that stands out is a Mac and cheese / Chile Verde concoction.  Pretty legit mixture of the two dishes, including tender chunks of pork.  Super delicious and unique. Try it!  Last note:  they do not have a kids menu per se, but if you are like us with picky children, the All-American sliders are basically little burgers, and the have good-sized little pizzas.  Both were hits with our 7 and 8 year old.  We will be back for sure if and when we stay at the NYNY again!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas I had lunch at the Tom's Urban at the New York New York Hotel. I had the pulled pork sandwich with garlic and sweet potato fries.  Everything was so delicious. Then for dessert I had the homemade cherry poptart! Awesome!!!  But the best part of the whole experience was my server, Sam. She was beyond amazing. She was very knowledgeable regarding the menu, making several suggestions. She was very attentive during my entire meal. I will definitely be returning on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Very large portions though so don't be afraid to ask for a to-go box"}
{"text":"Great location, good food but expensive but sevice isn't very good at all. Dropped by on a whim and left significantly  poorer much later.  Took forever to get a beer after ordering. $16.00 for a burger is a bit rich."}
{"text":"A play by play of our dinner!  The drinks, marg and Long Island, super! Fried pickles, tasty! Pizza was really good! Urban salad, where it's at. Order it and don't look back.  Our waitress Paige was super duper!  10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Located in a prime location on the strip and close to t-mobile arena. The food was good - not great. The menu has amazing options and everything sounds delicious. Great twists on fusion comfort food. Nothing was over the top WOW in flavor though. The service was awesome - the hostess that seated us and our server Emmanuel were terrific. The patio seating would be better and I would request that next time - indoor seating needs some more life or vibe. The calamari appetizer dusted in cornmeal was excellent. My husband ordered the BLT Lobster Roll and it came with huge chunks of lobster meat. So good!  I had the butter poached lobster and shrimp street tacos which were not bad but just lacked flavor. We ordered the street corn on the side and it was delicious!  I would like to come back for brunch and give this place another try."}
{"text":"Great place. Had XL Pickle Chicken Nashville Hot with Grits. We also had the Rubin with Garlic Fries.  Everything tasted great. Checked in with Yelp and got the free fried pickles. Awesome, light breading  and great. Food was excellent, portions were right. Chicken had a light breading and was juicy. Grits were good, if not a little too much size wise. The only small complaint might be the garlic seasoning on the fries, a little too much for us. Otherwise, service was great, server kept our waters full and checked back often. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"What a letdown. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet and a mimosa. They cooked the living hell out of my omelet, the hash browns and the toast which leached every last bit of flavor out the whole plate. The mimosa (which was $13) was maybe 8 ounces and I would estimate it was 7oz of orange juice and 1oz of champagne. My waitress came exactly 4 times, once to take my order, once to give me my order, once to take my debit card and once to return it to me (it was not busy). On the plus side, their bar area's decor was pretty cool and has a decent view."}
{"text":"Really good food and huge portions. Had the nachos, duck wings, edamame beans, all American burger with garlic fries, all of which were DELISH! It was the best burger I've had. They have a huge selection of beer on tap, including my favorite kona big wave ($8.50/pint)."}
{"text":"The problem is they over load the servers and you have to wait for an hour for to even get a drink! It was terrible and we left. Horrible service, there are plenty of other places to go in New York that are good."}
{"text":"An overall regrettable dining experience. The hostess was unapproachable or dare I say, \"bitchy.\" Also, we had no server once we were seated - a random server came up to us to let us know, explicitly, that he wasn't our server but he will take our drink orders. As we were ready to order, we also had to place our order with our not-so-server, but we kept having to flag him down to ask questions about the menu. I was irritated since we didn't receive a proper introduction, recommendation or detailed explanation of the menu.  Unfortunately, we were seated in a booth that shares the same corner as the staff's registers - what an awkward set-up. While we waited for our dinner we heard, loud and clear, server conversations; bickering and critiquing each-other. We also couldn't avoid hearing an earful of servers singing, obnoxiously. It's not a comfortable ambiance for us to relax in each others presence, or even enjoy private conversation.  The food was laughable. There was only one dish that we could honestly recommend and it was $13 ghost pepper chicken wings. That's it? The menu seems very confused and I'm sure the chef is just as confused.  Let's go through the items we tried:  Ghost pepper wings ghost chili BBQ and green ranch chili sauce $13 -Shockingly, this was the only item of the evening that we actually enjoyed. I loved the perfect balance of sweetness and the spicy heat offered in the ghost chili BBQ sauce. The ranch consistency was watery, but the flavor was unique and delicious. The wings were cooked properly and had a decent amount of moist meat. But seriously. Wings are wings, you aren't really missing anything here. Flavor rating: 4/5  Sticky belly steamed buns $9 - Total white-boy style (in a bad way) we weren't a fan of the dry, hard bao bun, tough, overcooked thick cut bacon & weird tangy salad dressing sauce. Also, the cabbage slaw looked wilted and brown. I've had my share of tasty baos in Vegas (try: Bachi Burger, Gordon Ramsey BurGR, Fat Choy) and this sits at the very bottom of the list. This dish needs major work. Blegh. Flavor rating: 2/5  Low country shrimp and grits $10 -  A serious disappointment. The \"crispy pork belly\" was a prank that was written on the menu description. It's actually tiny bits of chopped (hard) bacon. The fishy, tiny, frozen shrimp was offensively over-salted and lacking substantial cajun flavor. The grits were dry and bland and tasted like oatmeal, plus the cheddar cheese was sparse. All amateur mistakes. Flavor rating: 2/5  Sweet potato fries with Caribbean ketchup $4 - They arrived at our table room temperature and stale; we sent them back for a re-do. I was offended that we couldn't even get freshly fried sweet potatoes and that they offered us unwelcome fries from a heat lamp. The fries were standard, the ketchup was unique - but it's still nothing to write home about. You may want to go the extra mile and request some of the green chili ranch to pair with these fries - they work well together. Flavor rating: 2/5  After a disenchanting dinner, we were ready to leave our experience far behind us. This place is not for us and probably not for you either if you appreciate your taste buds."}
{"text":"Pineapple upside down cake awesome! Ruth is the best waitress! Brussels sprouts and prime rib sliders were amazing!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was great! I enjoyed three different and interesting tacos (vindaloo chicken, lobster and shrimp, and pork belly) which really hit the spot. All toppings perfectly complimented the fillings. The others in the group all liked their burgers. My husband's Banh-Mi burger was especially interesting. The beer/cider menu is extensive.   We sat on the patio and, although it was a bit chilly, we enjoyed the scenery and people watching. Service was great! The server was kind enough to give my friend a free drink after a fry accidentally fell in her last drink, which was almost done."}
{"text":"Ioana was a wonderful server. Thank you for being so polite.  We are locals and decide to come down and do the \"tourist\" thing and you were amazing. Thanks again, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome !! From the service to the atmosphere. The staff was very engaging and helpful. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"It is inside New York New York... The dress is casual... Very spacious inside and outside I ordered the chicken and corn bread pancake... The chicken pieces were very tender easy to cut however I cannot say the same thing about the pancake it was thin but not that great kind of dry even with the syrup ."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban was a great spot for going to brunch hungover or you want a late night snack. The restaurant is large and on the first floor of the NYNY hotel. The food is amazing but the service was not that great. The server forgot my friend's Philly cheesesteak sandwich. We went there for breakfast before hitting the road so she was starving because we all hadn't eaten since the night before. She eventually got her food but it was a struggle getting a discount since the rest of the group ended up waiting longer until her breakfast was served.   I also would be wary of going here if you're looking for a quick bite. We waited longer here than any other restaurant from that weekend trip. It wasn't even that busy (we went during breakfast hours when most people are still sleeping in Vegas) and it still was a two-hour thing.   The food is good though once it comes so if you want to kick back with friends, check it out!"}
{"text":"Went to check this place out due to the awesome reviews......well. I ordered a standard eggs benny. I asked for my eggs to be poached hard and they were runny. Along with the runny eggs was a lukewarm barely toasted English muffin and cold flavorless hash browns. I wouldn't necessarily call this a good experience."}
{"text":"Best lobster and shrimp mac & cheese! We stopped in off a whim and so happy we did. They atmosphere is awesome.  Try it! Get the lobster mac. You'll love it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here recently and we really enjoyed everything !! The restaurant itself is stylish and up to date .. Our waitress was just adorable she was very helpful and very nice !! She was a cute little blonde, maybe early twenties ...  I think her name was Robin ... The menu had so many good options so I asked her what she recommends... She suggested the Sin city Burger which was a great option and she also suggested the cocktail walk of shame which made me giggle a Little ... And I will be back for that one !!! My friend ordered a philly and a beer and she said everything was good she considered ordering another to go but was too stuffed ... We will for sure be back !!!"}
{"text":"I just had the best meal at NYNY casino. Toms urban just blew all the other restaurants in the casino out of the water. I had the sticky pork belly rolls and the colorado hot brown... Amazing!  The green chili ranch sauce is the best thing ever. The other restaurants in the casino better be scared."}
{"text":"Boy... this place was very disappointing. I travelled to get to it on a recommendation from a friend, and the food was just poor. Everyone at my table of 4 felt the same way. I don't even remember what I ordered... very \"meh.\""}
{"text":"We walked in at 10:45am and a guy didn't come to our booth until 10:50... he pointed at ya and said he'll bring us water. No greeting no welcome. We won't be back for this crappy service"}
{"text":"Amazing new addition to the Las Vegas Strip.  I usually come to Vegas twice a year, and I tend to visit the same restaurants each time. Being a creature of habit, I was a bit skeptical to try a new place. Tom's Urban really out-did themselves and have now become my new favorite place to dine on the strip.  The atmosphere was great, and the staff were very friendly. I ordered the filet mignon sliders with sweet potato fries.  Oh my, were these delicious!!  My boyfriend ordered the carnitas tacos, which of course I had to have a bite.  The menu has a blend of items to satisfy the most picky eater.  We sat inside, as it was pretty cold outside, but they have an outdoor bar and patio area that will be prove to be prime people watching during my trip back to Vegas this summer.   We loved it so much, we're going to the one in LA Live tonight!"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch and EVERYTHING was fabulous! The service is AMAZING Erron, Lina, and Carmen are so nice and will take unbelievable care of you from the beginning of your experience till the moment you leave. The food is extremely tasty I don't think it would be possible for you to be disappointed with any food choice here. We had the Brussels sprouts, lobster Mac and cheese, hangover slopper, buffalo chicken sliders, edamame, fried pickles, duck wings, pot stickers, eggs Benedict, etc. clearly we tried a few things and nothing was short of absolutely delectable!! You have to try the drinks too... I mean you are in Vegas!   again you will NOT be disappointed in anything you choose here... Unless you choose not to stop in while you're in NYNY!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat breakfast & lunch. Ate here 3 times in 3 days! Huge menu, cajun frog legs and street tacos were outstanding. Great place to catch a game awesome TVs & drinks ."}
{"text":"This is a solid lunch place. We had to try their wings and found them to be fatty, not very crunchy and overall underwhelming. However, the apple/Gorgonzola salad and the BBQ chicken pizza were really good. Great spot for people watching, being outdoors and pizza :)"}
{"text":"Wow, the lemon, poppyseed blueberry pancakes are amazing! One order could feed 3.  No syrup necessary. They are fluffy, light and very tasteful.  My fiancé enjoyed the BBQ wings. The portion was not as generous. (6) to an order. We sat outside on the patio and it was very comfortable. Thus is a great spot for people watching! We would definitely return. Our waiter was delightful and thorough.  We returned on 9/1/2017. We wanted those delicious lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes! We even called 2 days before and the hostess assured us they were still on the menu. NOT TRUE! Very disappointed since I made a phone call to the restaurant prior to arriving.  Ron, our server was great but we were disappointed with our visit this time.  Had pancakes and they were ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, sat at the bar. Took awhile to get greeted and for the bar to get cleaned up in front of us. We were just handed menus the bartender didn't acknowledge us. Took quite a long time to get a drink order in. Ordered the urban Bloody Mary and it was pretty bad. Looked similar to a well Bloody Mary from the sports book. Did not have ingredients listed on menu.  Bartender had really bad costumer service, refills were scarce, getting closed out took way too long for barely anybody in the bar. She was more concerned about scoring hockey tickets from a regular than she was hospitable to people at the bar.   Ordered shrimp and grits for $23 not worth the price. Shrimp were good size and pretty spicy, it had good flavor but come on $23 for shrimp and grits.    If you're looking for a place to eat before Knights games, skip this one."}
{"text":"Update to review! The manager was nice enough to contact me and apologize for my experience, always appreciated.  We had a great experience! It was definitely busy, but the whole team was very accomodating. We ended up having a few more people with us as well, and it was no problem for them. Our friends had actually went the day before and liked it so much they wanted to come back!  The Ghost pepper wings were FANTASTIC! I love spicy foods and this was right up my alley. My husband tried them, even though we knew they were too hot for him, and he liked the flavor as well. His mouth was on fire after, but the manager came by with a glass of milk for him. Very thoughtful.   I also had the chopped salad, and it was huge! I couldn't finish it! I liked that the dressing was served on the side as well. So many times I feel salads as overdressed for my liking, and this way I am able to control that.   Dessert was the smores, and by far my favorite thing I ate my entire weekend in Vegas, I am still dreaming about it.   My companions all said there food was great and had zero complaints. One of them ordered the same lobster tacos as the previous day, but he did comment that they were a little dryer than that day before, but the pieces of lobster and shrimp were much bigger (maybe just a small ratio mishap, no one every complains about extra lobster)! He was still very happy with his meal.   Great spot to people watch, good prices, and good food."}
{"text":"Had the BahnMi burger and it was cooked to perfect medium per request. Great burger. May not be a whole 1/2 pound but everything else was perfection so I'll let it slide."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a warm weekday morning after walking the strip. Sat on the patio which is great for people watching. The service was wonderful.  I ordered the tree hugger eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was sub par and the poached egg was very undercook. Needless to say that was a disappointment. The hash browns had burnt Parmesan cheese covering it which I could do without. Hey, it's the Vegas strip so for the service alone I'll say it was ok, the food, completely overrated unfortunately."}
{"text":"First off, awesome service! Came here for an early brunch and was immediately greeted by two friendly hostesses who allowed us to choose wherever we wanted to sit. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros and got bottomless mimosas and a nitro coffee. The mimosas were brought before the first one was gone, we were checked up on by multiple staff and enjoyed sitting outside in the misters."}
{"text":"Ordered to go from the bar.  Bartender was ok but did take a while to come back to me to get my order.  Ordered a chicken potsticker salad for my daughter so was cautious because of the dressings.  So he said to not get the sriracha sauce and said the other sauces would be good.  Also got brussel sprouts.  Well, got back to our room and salad dressings were so spicy that she could not eat any of it, also the potsticker were not really steamed all the way.  They were really thick and chewy and had a gooey texture.  I had asked if we could get them fried but he said no.  Disappointed because it was a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how you screw up a margarita pizza but Tom's Urban managed to do so: the sauce was dried up and there were like five dollops of cheese on the entire pizza. My boyfriends medium burger was over cooked and our original waiter didn't show up until it was time for us to pay the bill. Spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Showed up at 5:15, hostess asked if we had a reservation. We did not, the patio was half empty but she said she'd 'see what she could do'. 5 minutes later we were seated. Took a waitress about 5 minutes to come take a drink order, another 5 minutes for waters, another 5 minutes to get a can of beer. Food came out fairly fast, and it was below-average. Garlic Parmesan fries lacked the garlic and the Parmesan. BBQ chicken sliders were lacking with the slaw. Sweet potato fries were average. Once we got our food, the waitress was non-existent. She never re-filled our waters. With all the options available in Las Vegas, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Breaks my heart to give 1 star but unfortunately 1 star is being generous.  We were looking for a restaurant with great food, in if not close to New York, New York.  After checking out the menu options we made this selection because of the wide variety. I had the Chimichuri Steak and fries, my husband had the Cuban and fries. First off, there is ZERO chimichuri sauce served with this meal. I asked the waitress if she could bring some and she advised that they do not serve chimichuri sauce anymore, only a vinaigrette dressing that is included. The steak was over done and the fries were very cold and stale. My husband was happy with the Cuban, which is my reason I am even giving one star however, again, his fries were horrible due to being cold and stale tasting. I brought this to the attention of the server she did take my meal away and took it off the bill. I would not recommend this restaurant despite the great location.  I take my food seriously and for what they are charging for this meal I wanted what was on the menu. We left and went to a fabulous Italian place in the hotel:)"}
{"text":"We didn't get service so we walked out!  It still makes me upset whenever I think about what happened to us. We tried this place last year and we liked it. Their sliders, duck wings and drinks were good so we decided to come here again this year.   Came here on 4th of July around 5:00pm. Hostess greeted us and we got a table inside. The place wasn't busy. 10 minutes later no one came to our table. No biggie. We got up and moved to the bar area (back part). Bar tender was on the other side of the bar so he couldn't see us. We called a staff walking by and asked for the menu. Another 10 minutes passed by and we saw the the staff we asked organizing the tables and utensil on the other side of the room. What the heck? She forgot about us! There were also lot of staff walking around and cleaning and no one bothered to come to us. Hhhhmmm. So upset that we just left.   When we got outside, a man who appeared to be a manager greeted us \"thank you for coming\" and I said, \"We didn't even get service\". He immediately apologized and asked us to come back and we refused. We appreciate the apology, but not coming back again.   This place will still get business because they are on the strip but do I recommend them? Absolutely not. Busy or not, I hope this place works on their customer service."}
{"text":"Great services and great omelet! The prices are good, not that expensive! Good place to have your breakfast  Cocktails are nice, I ordered Tom's cocktail. A cocktail with vodka, strawberry purée, cucumber, lime, gingerbeer and mint. Almost tasted healthy, yum!   The service during breakfast was good, friendly waiters! They refilled our cup of coffee and glasses of water regularly.   The bar keepers during the evening were unfortunately not that enthusiastic. I like when someone shows if he or she loves his or her job, but they didn't it without any passion it all."}
{"text":"Wow! Order the Sin City! It will change your life, you're welcome! Walking in, there is a nice atmosphere with a New York feel of course. Food takes a bit to come out but you can tell it is fresh to order and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 12.  The waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu.  Everyone's meal arrived cold. I would not come back."}
{"text":"We ordered extra spicy for the chicken and was amazing the quality of food was great  Best to go place and it has nice and big bar too  I"}
{"text":"From 7/7/15  Since we were staying at the New York New York Hotel, we decided to try Tom's Urban.   This restaurant has a hip, trendy vibe with its décor, music videos playing in the background, and your choice of indoor/outdoor seating.   Our server came and took our order. The service was great here. I got the Truffle Portabella and Swiss Burger, which has a truffle mayo, and spinach. It was so so good!! I was impressed with the way everything tasted here.   If I by some chance happen to be near New York New York I would come back here for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Paige was awesome and a total sweetheart! Helped us from the beginning, and all of her recommendations were on point. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The menu was fun and exciting. Our waiter Michael was awesome. My son had the Hangover Slopper. It was a delicious twist on the american burger. We were very impressed with the service as well."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches ever! I'm in Vegas for a convention and staying at the MGM. I saw an ad for Tom's Urban on the Vegas channel at the hotel and decided to try it. I like to check out menus online before going to a new restaurant, so I arrived thinking I was going to order the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, but the Philly prime rib dip sandwich jumped right off the menu just begging to be tried. Whew! What a great decision that was (although the mac and cheese may be just as amazing).   The prime rib beef was out of this world delicious, tender, juicy and full of flavor. It was served with a beef demi glace. It's thicker and richer than au jus typically served as a dip. I'd never heard of it, so I had to look it up:  Demi-glace is a rich brown sauce in French cuisine used by itself or as a base for other sauces. The term comes from the French word glace, which, used in reference to a sauce, means icing or glaze (Google is a magical thing).  For the side, I chose the lemon rosemary tots. Crispy tots served with a lemon rosemary aioli dip - genius! I gobbled those up even though I was already stuffed from eating just half of the sandwich! I'm a big eater and I was stuffed to near food coma status by the time I called it quits and I still had half a sandwich left!  Here's how good it was. I couldn't leave it on the plate, so I got a box while wondering what I was going to do with it since my hotel doesn't have a refrigerator and there was no way I would be able to finish it the same evening. The food was way too good to just throw away though, so I wandered around trying to find someone who looked hungry. I didn't want to offend anyone, but I couldn't imagine wasting that awesome sandwich. I finally found someone who reluctantly took it from me, but at least I didn't have to witness it going into the trash. I hope someone was able to enjoy the second half of the sandwich as much as I enjoyed the first (they were served cut in two pieces, so it's not like it was half eaten and not totally gross, right?).  Now I'm going to have to go back before I leave, because I still want to try that lobster shrimp mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience today!! Our waiter Nate was awesome and very friendly!! Good was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there tonight with a group of a dozen women, all with dietary restrictions. Our waiter, Michael, was amazing! He was knowledgeable about every item on the menu, and assisted everyone in selecting an appropriate and delicious choice. The food was sooo good and the portions were huge! The lovely manager, Dani, stopped at our table to see how everything was. It was absolutely perfect. Thank you Michael and Dani for the fantastic dinner experience."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I had food at this place. I was craving hamburger. First we ordered drinks. It turns out they only have drinks from one company ( once again choices are being taken away from us ) we asked for medium well done meat. They came completely pink, no dressing, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no pickles. It was about 21:00$. When we asked about that the server said I can bring you those as side order. Which we did ask for them. As soon as we ate the burgers, our stomachs started growling and immediately we had to run to the bathrooms. We had ordered two different type of hamburgers. My wife's was about 17:00 $ the jalapeño burger. None of us had breakfast nor lunch today and since we were hungry and had waited 30 minutes to be seated , we had finished more than 1/2 our burgers so, we paid for them and left.    I felt that for the first time I should write a review for a restaurant and let others know and not to waste their time and money for this place or if you still want to go, please lower your expectations way, way down so you won't be so disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict. Hash browns were a little charred on the bottom side. Not flat griddled like most, from the shape it was done in a small sauté pan. Egg had a little more of the egg white runnier than I like. Service was good."}
{"text":"Might be the worst service I've ever experienced in Vegas. I Sat down at the bar at 2p, it's now 2:11 and not one person has asked me if I want water or a cocktail or a menu. I'm gonna sit here and wait and see how long it takes these guys to help me..........."}
{"text":"Tip: skip the bar adjacent to the inside of the New York New York - the bartenders aren't terribly attentive and the other bar on the outside of the restaurant is much more fun, lively, and the service is much better and friendlier.    Overall, even though this place has that chain-y feel that usually has me running for the hills, you could do a lot worse.  Especially for how convenient it is if you're staying in the hotel.  The bottomless mimosas deal is extremely reasonable, especially given how fresh the orange juice they use is, and the crispy chicken and cornbread pancake will knock that hangover right out of you!  A pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Best duck wings EVER, the skin is amazing! Great beer selection, menu and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It's very awesome steak! I love it. the environment is good. I'm very enjoy when I had dinner in there, and I set outside. that's the best way to see the night lights on the strip road."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal, I got a sin city burger and it was probably the best meal I had all week.  We (party of 6) walked in at lunch without a reservation and was told we would have to wait even with plenty of tables open. The manager finally sat us at a table after the hostess complained to us how we didn't make a reservation.  The service was pretty good although they did forget a few things and were slow on the drink refills.  I would come back however I would make sure to have a reservation so I wouldn't have to deal with the hostess again."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't understand why they don't have more stars their service and food was incredible.  We got the colorado calamari,  Pot sticker salad  Adobe steak Nachos and the two way fries. Definitely must try's and would come back for sure!    Paige our server btw Was da Bomb!"}
{"text":"I've come here in the past and recommended friends/coworkers to this place and they have all loved it! (Tacos are unreal and drinks are awesome)   I know I should've written a review sooner about all the perfect experiences but this not so perfect experience tonight has made me want to write a review even more (as bad as that sounds).  I'm out here for work and my boyfriend tagged along and we had an issue with our order and consulted our waiter Eddie (who is awesome) and he was more than happy to get the manager, Danielle, and she was AMAZING!!! She ended up comping our bill and offered to get us drinks and another meal that I could eat. It's not often that you run into this kind of service that's willing to go ALL the way to make their customers happy ESP these days so kuddos to her!   We will def be back and def continue to recommend our friends and coworkers that come here for conferences !"}
{"text":"This isn't Denny's. This isn't a generic breakfast buffet. It's a lounge right on the strip that does brunch and other food while boasting an impressive view and even more impressive drink menu.   We stopped for breakfast after having done the buffets, Denny's and fast food on the strip earlier on the trip. We sat at the bar and were greeted by the baryend, who was exceptionally nice. It was her second day on the job there, but our drinks showed she was pretty experienced at pouring.   I ordered the poppyseed blueberry pancakes, which filled a huge plate and were bigger than my big appetite could handle. My boyfriend got the Treehugger with bacon eggs Benedict, and claims they were the best he's ever had.   The drinks were fantastic as well - The Dark and Stormier was delicious and very boozy, and the Tom's Cup had great flavour. I also tried a salted caramel rum milkshake - it would be worth a trip back just for that.   Overall, excellent place, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. One star deduction just because the price was a bit high, given the pricing of other similar places we visited."}
{"text":"Terrible menu, extremely over priced for low quality food. Have had better tacos from taco bell. If you are going to eat on the strip pick somewhere else. Save your $50+ for somewhere that will give you quality food and get your order right."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Vegas, all these strip restaurants start to look the same. I went here for a power lunch business meeting, and actually enjoyed the food.  I give 3 stars because it was deliciously average for Vegas- the burger capital of the world.  I tried their Korean-esque burger.  I forget what it's called.  Cooked to perfect medium well burger-ness.  Sweet potato fries were crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. Salted just enough to create an interesting flavor.  Ambiance: Great for happy hour or a fun, Friday night dinner.  Rather loud for a business meeting.  Service: Excellent.  Our waitress was kind and attentive.  Typical Vegas standard.  Since moving here, I have to say that overall, Vegas definitely is a hospitality town."}
{"text":"5 stars for the bloody Mary's and our server Paulina. She was fun with just the right amount of sass to put up with mine. 3 stars for the food... The breakfast burrito and steak were a bit dry for my taste.  I'd come back to have drinks (if Paulina served me)"}
{"text":"While it was a very beautiful place, it was empty and I got sat in the back of the restaurant next to the door and waitress station with no cool view what so ever ...So very hard to carry on a conversation when I have to hear 5 people behind me talking about who's working Sunday and who will pick up shifts, my waitress barely gave us time to look at the menu and after we told her we weren't ready she came back every 2 minutes 3 times. Once we finally ordered she topped off my water but not my wife's, which left her with out anything to drink for a while cause she then stopped coming for 5 minutes (bitter sweet break). As far as the food goes .... Super expensive bar food ... 75 bucks for two burgers , fries , fried calamari and one beer... The same meal at the yard house would cost 40 bucks and taste wwwaaaayyyyyy better... So thanks but no thanks I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place ,  It's Vegas so everything is pretty darn good ! Feasted on tacos and drank to many margaritas... Great atmosphere  Food portions are huge !!  So order wisely"}
{"text":"I like the brand. I like the design and furniture. I like the lighting and fixtures. I like the affordable pricing considering it's right on the Strip. What I'm not crazy about is the food. It's average at best. Sticky belly buns ($9) suffered from hard buns, overassessed pork belly and a slaw drowning in liquid reminiscent of a dirty mop soaking in a bucket. They don't have a kids menu but offered kid-sized portions of their cheese pizza (which was overcooked) and chocolate shake. On the brighter side, the ginger chicken potstickers ($8) showcased a nice sear and ample filling, while the bacon avocado burger's ($17) chargrilled, well seasoned patty between toasted brioche reminded me why I'm a fan of Smashburger (also created by restaurateur Tom Ryan). It's a simple, well executed, juicy and greasy burger that satisfies that craving. Washing it down with their Kraken spiced rum salted caramel shake ($13.50) was the perfect way to say F-you to my sometimes healthy eating habits. It was a touch heavy on alcohol (that's not really a complaint) and I was surprised to hear that waitresses are responsible for creating the shakes, not the kitchen or bar staff.  With a location right on the Strip in the boulevard/district area off of NYNY leading to the under construction arena, they'll probably stay busy. Unfortunately, it won't be because the food is a hit."}
{"text":"Nice place, looks good when you first get in. Service was good, friendly hostess, good bartender ... It was early, not too much of a crowd. Everything was good until the food arrived, menu description looks awesome but the food was just average... it was barely hot, (poached) eggs were over cooked. It's disappointing because we are paying \"Vegas\" prices, which we knew when we walked in."}
{"text":"great breakfast! nice surprise, especially since it's on the strip/located inside NY NY Hotel.  expensive but it's the location.  fresh, tasty and flavorful (try one of the benedicts  - I recommend the one with avocado and bacon!).  service was good."}
{"text":"Flying into Vegas pushing close to 11 am I'm feeling the hunger and the thirst for a cold beer.. Rolling into New York New York as I wait for my room to become available at the M Resort I check out Tom's Urban.  Upon hitting the place I grab a seat at the bar, crack down a cold brew from a local Las Vegas brewery and try the Duck Wings! Amazing taste.. not feeling to hunger to consume a big burger or something crazy these things do the job perfect! While I didn't try much more the food was great, my bar tender was very very attentive one of the best I ever met over the years (she was working Sat Jan 31st for staff that read's this) and all around the place was very cool.. I would def come back and check this place out again for a larger meal. Easy 4 star's all day."}
{"text":"We were looking for something for lunch on the strip and just wandered into Tom's.  We sat outside and were served promptly.  We ordered the nachos and buffalo chicken sliders and a few beers.  Fairly larger beer selection and the food was quite good.  The nachos were huge and more than enough for two people and the sliders were good too!  It was a pleasant surprise and a place I'd recommend if looking for lunch or dinner on the strip."}
{"text":"We didn't really know what we were hungry when we walked in. With the help of our server we chose the Sin City Burgers. This is an excellent, very large, juicy burger! The meat is quality, the egg was perfectly cooked, and the bacon was crispy! I had garlic fries and they were perfection and my husband had sweet potato fries that were great! Our sever was awesome and my husband's soda never went dry. If you are looking for a good burger this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Tom's urban is a great place to have lunch, dinner, or just a drink.. Great vibe and fast service! The open space provides a lot of light and having an entrance next to the strip makes a very convenient walk in.  The food has always been delicious, tried a few entrées from the menu but my favorite has been the CountryCrispy Shrimp with the Nashville sauce  Am definitely a huge fan of this one!!!  Overall the place is a fantastic place for anyone and everyone.  If you're anywhere around NewYorkNewYork or even just on the strip, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant in my entire existence. I go with a group of 8 girls to get lunch, and our server tells us she can give us the bottomless mimosas for $19 (which ends at 1) if she punches it in the system before 1 pm. So its 12:50 and she checks all our ID's and brings us the first round. Next thing we know, the manager walks over and tells us he can't accommodate that, after she's already charged us for it, and tells us he can bring us \"one more round to be nice\"... First off, none of us would have ordered mimosas in the first place if our server hadnt told us she would still serve us bottomless after 1 pm. So we talk to the manager again, he's completely unwilling to compromise with us and then after 15 minutes of arguing back and forth he agrees to give us two mimosas for the price of what one costs. They bring us back a round of 8 glasses of literal orange juice, thinking we wouldn't notice. As if the cheap ass manager couldn't just do one thing right. So a random bartender, Spencer, probably sees that this manager has half a brain and comes over with a bottle of champagne and fixes the problem immediately. THATS ALL WE WANTED. We just wanted what we paid for. On top of all of this, our food was cold, and everytime we asked for something, like napkins, they literally ignored our existence. One star is gracious for an experience like this. All in all, don't come to this establishment unless you're here for Spencer."}
{"text":"Good bar to watch a game in. If it's not crowded, the management will change any TV you want over to whatever game you want, which is all you really want in a sports bar.  Great selection of draft brews - the only downsides to this place are the astronomical prices for everything, which I guess is true almost anywhere on the Strip, so whattaya gonna do?  $8 for any decent beer in a 16 oz. glass.  Pro drinker tip:  There's a miniscule-to-zero discount on buying any draft beer in the 22 or 33 oz. glasses, so just buy the 16 oz.  Unless your waiter is really slow.  I found it offensive that a 90-minute Dogfish Head was priced at $13 for a 16-oz.  High prices on the Strip, fine, but that, sir, is OUTRAGEOUS!  I won't stand for it.  I had some duck wings to soak up my alcohol as well.  They were fine.  Tasted like chicken.  But bigger."}
{"text":"Best food and service that we've had all week!  Paige was great, super quick when we needed anything and picked out an amazing appetizer of Brussel Sprouts.  The beer flights are great and each is 8oz instead of the usual 4oz at most bars.  I should have just got sliders and not fries also because I was stuffed and can't eat the fries.  Highly recommend this place because the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Eddy was our server and he did a fantastic job! Keeping the drinks full, friendly, and great suggestions. This was my first time here and I will definitely be back! Thank you"}
{"text":"We have had 2 excellent meals ( and drinks) at Tom's Urban NYNY! But the best thing about this restaurant has got to be our waitress Sam R. She served us for lunch and breakfast and is such a joy! Great personality and awesome service! Her smile makes a great day even better!"}
{"text":"Deftige Gerichte und Sandwiches sind üppige Portionen die schmecken. Snacks so la la: Pommes sind sehr dünn und trocken."}
{"text":"This place was great- $20 bottomless mimosas, and i had a carnitas breakfast burrito that was good but the carnitas was really dry so i do not recommend getting it with carnitas. My boyfriend had the prime rib philly cheese steak dip and it was amaaaaaaazing! I wish i had ordered that for myself but he shared! Service was good but not great (had to flag our server down a couple of times for drink refills) but i think it was because we went on a Sunday for brunch so they were busy. We can't wait to go back on our next vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I love the Crispy Chicken and Corn Pancake! Mac and cheese was on point. Shout out to 5-star Eddy and his killer service."}
{"text":"Came to breakfast here. There was a waiting time for sitting in patio(hostess was slow and not friendly) so we sat inside. The portion sizes are good. The breakfast platter was good. The jam on toast was perfect. The omelet was delicious would recommend to sharing omelet as it comes with hash browns and toast. Would have preferred no cheese in hash browns but it was something new. Price was reasonable, give it a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We needed a break from gambling and came here at around midnight Saturday. So glad we did! I don't know who they have playing music on the weekends but that guy was pretty amazing. He could play anything and everything. We enjoyed our bahnmi lettuce wraps and tater tots while listening to the live entertainment. My only gripe is having the waiter talk me into getting a larger cocktail. I didn't look at the price but to go from a small to a large is a considerable difference! We paid $23 for a weak Mule Kick. Otherwise, everything else was great!"}
{"text":"came here to watch sports and got some drinks and apps.  the apps were delicious.  good spot on the trip to hang out."}
{"text":"My friends and I are convinced that this restaurant paid for all of these 4 or 5 star Yelp reviews because our experience was abysmal.  We came here for brunch at 10:30AM on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, which we were excited about because we thought that meant we'd be seated and would get our food pretty quickly, since we were pretty hangry. Uh, yeah, no. That couldn't have been farther from the truth.  Even though literally 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, we were told that they couldn't seat us until a half hour later. We then asked if we could just sit outside and the 'hostess' went, \"oh ok\", as if she forgot that that was an option. Since it was around 50 degrees, we asked if they could turn the heat lamps on so as not to freeze to death and got a snide remark from the hostess, \"yeah but you're gonna have to wait because we need to get someone from management to do it.\" So yeah, great service so far.  After waiting a good 10 min, our waitress finally arrived to take drink orders.   20 min later, still no heat. After giving up getting service from them, one of us just got up and turned it on.  30 min later, our drinks finally came, except for the tea that a bunch of people ordered, which apparently only came in flavors that the waitress assumed we wouldn't want, so she just decided for us that we wouldn't want it.  After the drinks came, we finally ordered our food and waited at least another 45 min to an hour for it to arrive. When it finally arrived, we were treated with burnt toast, over-cooked eggs, a lack of condiments, and more.  All in all, unless you want to spend a good 2-3 hours at a restaurant that delivers inedible food and terrible customer service, my friends and I definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  Everything was fresh and delicious. Our server was Ruth, she's the sweetest and very attentive. One of the best waiters since I've been in town. I'm definitely coming back soo!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We are season ticket holders for Golden Knights and are at the Arena often. This has become a regular spot for us to pre-game, as they have amazing deals and amazing staff!!! Aaron the GM is hands on and really makes you feel welcome. James the bartender took amazing care of us and made sure we knew about all the deals and specials. I highly recommend this coming here for some food and drinks."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and so was our bartender Kyler! Absolutely amazing service and was very knowledgeable on the menu, gave great recommendations! Try the appetizer Mac and cheese, the wontons, and the edamame. The BLT lobster roll was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Really over priced. It was okay but we could have had Dennys for half the price and same quality. Nothing special. I hear their lunch and dinner is better, maybe we'll try that in the future. Our server was a little pushy because we didn't know what we wanted right away."}
{"text":"I feel sick. Waited 45 minutes for our food to come. I think the only reason we got it was because as the waitress walked by I said \"I'm so hungry\" than magically our food appeared. The food was cold... I order a veggie omelette with toast and hashbrowns. My girlfriend ordered the cornbread pancakes and chicken.   I took a bite of my cold 45 minute cook time omelette  and there was goat cheese in it. I dispise goat cheese. I felt like I was going to throw up. On the menu it says the omelette comes with cheddar cheese not goat cheese. I informed my waitress and she magically brought  me another cold omelette and cold has browns in about 4 minutes....   So initially I waited 45 minutes now 4 for a replacement omlette. By now I lost my appetite, I feel gross. Don't go here."}
{"text":"**Review is only for BREAKFAST!   Couldn't decide whether to give this 3 or 4 stars..  Presentation of food, environment, and service is great but I've had better breakfast elsewhere. It's probably the best choice out of the places in the New York New York hotel though!   //TREEHUGGER BENEDICT (3/5): The definition of just o.k... One of my eggs had already been popped by the time the dish got to my table, the English muffins were too hard, and the hollandaise sauce has literally 0 flavor. AND it was an extra $2 to add bacon. On the bright side, the $2 were well spent because the bacon was cooked perfectly - chewy, crunchy, and not too oily. Also, the avocados were plentiful and super fresh. However, the one thing that completely saved this dish was the AMAZING HASH BROWNS! They were mixed with some cheesy goodness to make the potatoes really stringy and chewy, but not overwhelming... They were the best hash browns I've ever had at a brunch restaurant.   //LEMON POPPYSEED BLUEBERRY PANCAKES (4.5/5): Suuuuper good and something I would definitely get again! It comes with sweet cream and salted caramel butter, which offered additional flavor to the already super lemony pancakes! I have really high standards for pancakes so I was impressed - it tasted like a lemon muffin but in pancake form! I just wish the pancake was toasted a little more so that the outside would be a little crispier.   Basically, 2 defining items at this restaurant were the hash browns and the pancakes. But great service and environment! :)"}
{"text":"Great food ..Great atmosphere!   Customer service is always 5 star And the drinks are excellent especially the small punch bowl, it's definitely the best bang for your buck. Can't wait to come back again. I recommend this place to all my friends and family!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food - great service - great people-watching location (outdoor patio with heat lamps).  Very reasonably priced.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing place right on the strip.. staff are very friendly and attentive.. food is amazing.. i havr food sensitivities and they were very accommodating :)"}
{"text":"We didn't have dinner here, but we had drinks at the bar after leaving dinner at the America restaurant which is also located inside New York New York.  Drinks:  Ultimat Peach Cosmo, Sin City Punch, and Vodka and Red Bull.  Wow. Those drinks were fabulous.  The Sin City Punch was my favorite. That drink really packs a punch.  The bartender was great and had many suggestions."}
{"text":"The food was decent but unfortunately the server tried to rip us off. We were a group of 6, we came here to eat and have a few drinks on Halloween before a show, the tab was around $186, my 5 friends all put down cash and I had a card, we told our server, Bernadette, we wanted to pay cash and put the rest on my card which was about $56. I assumed this was a common thing that any server can do but when I got the receipt back she charged the whole bill to my card and tried to pocket all the cash. This is not OK! I will never go back to this place they hire SCAMMERS! We called her out and she knew exactly what she did. If you go to this place make sure to double check your bill because they will try and get over on you."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. It was pretty empty and signs all over the outside says happy hour. Little did we know, happy hour does not apply when it is March Madness.  That was fine but when the waitress told us there is a 2 drink minimum per hour because it is March Madness we were like WTF why was this not said before we for seated?!  No happy hour and a drink MINIMUM? They must be crazy. At least let customers know BEFORE getting seated that there is a drink minimum even if there are no happy hour deals.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I hit Happy Hour here, which was an interesting set up- get here early, because the prices for happy hour creep higher and higher as each hour passes.  We were excited to try a bunch of the foods off of their trendy looking menu, and for the most part, the foods were what we expected.  When It comes down to it though, the food just just good, not amazing, but still good.  We definitely got what we payed for and I don't regret coming here, but I am in no hurry to return here."}
{"text":"We had breakfast. It was good. We ordered the Salted Caramel Skillet French Toast with a side of bacon (which they forgot and brought later).  It was super sweet. The bacon helped. We also had the Figgy Piggy, a solid breakfast sandwich. And the Beach Bum, a solid omlete. Good portion sizes. The also had sides of the home made pop tarts and lemon rosemary tots. Both were great."}
{"text":"Definitely brunch here!   The atmosphere is upbeat but also perfectly chill for your hangover 'cause we know you have one. The food was very good (agreed on by all people at the table) and everything on the menu looks delicious too. The endless mimosas are the way to go and I highly recommend the breakfast burrito. Very cool looking bar and I saw they have a world of beer selections on tap so I'll have to try next time.   Great service, food, and aura. Short wait on a Sunday afternoon.   Super excited to go to the one near me in Denver! =)"}
{"text":"Loved the service, great vibe, but food a bit meh. Went simple with Prime Rib Sliders and Cheeseburger Sliders. The Prime Rib Sliders okay, but Cheeseburger Sliders had cold buns and were beyond dry. We were staying at NY/NY and wanted to like the place, but if you screw up a slider how do you try anything else?"}
{"text":"I had the All American Burger with the Garlic fries. Tasted very good at the time, too much grease though, sick later in the evening.   My friend I was with got the chicken fingers. Over done. Manager was very nice took them off the bill."}
{"text":"It is so ridiculously loud in this place you can barely hear the person sitting across from you. It's horrible!"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience... Joanne our waitress was amazing and answered all of our questions... We ordered the Denver Omelette, the Adobo Chicken Burrito and the Spinach Omelette and they were all amazing... The portions are definitely more than enough and just one of the best experiences thus far in Vegas... Will definitely keep this on the rotation for future trips..."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend that's a Vegas local.  The hostess suggested the duck wings as she seated us.  We ordered that and the Brussels sprouts.  Both were over sauced to me.  But both were oh so good.  A little less sauce and I would declare perfection.  After several beers and another dining destination in the plans, I had my eyes set on the Angus sliders.  I thought I heard angels singing.  Tender and perfectly done, pink center.  The atmosphere is great.  A perfect people watching place.  Service seemed a little slow considering the place was not packed.  But I wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere.  From the former volleyball playing moth killer to the \"that doesn't say Philippines on my arm\", the servers are friendly and attentive.  Definitely worth a second visit for me."}
{"text":"The reasoning behind this low rating are simply that I have never received worse food poisoning than I did from this restaurant. My meal was not anything exotic either, the standard breakfast platter with sausage, eggs, toast and hash, but the fact remains that the food at this restaurant made me ill beyond belief. Service was acceptable, food tasted ok but I'll never return due to how sick their food made me."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Tom's urban. I really enjoy this place for breakfast/lunch. Great food and selection, outdoor heated/misted seating. The grits are to die for, prices are just right and...Bottomless Mimosas.  Also great selection for vegetarians.  I hit in my book and I will return next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice little place with outside seating. Prices aren't too high. Only complaint we had is the food came out lukewarm. We were hungry so we didn't want to send it back and wait longer, it still tasted good. Our waiter was super nice and got us a discount because of it."}
{"text":"I saw this place on a channel in my hotel room and was intrigued by the food they offered. It looked like street foods such as: burgers, tacos, wings, etc. My friend and I walked over and got a table immediately. It was pretty empty for a Friday night. When I saw the place, it looked like a big sports bar.   I ordered the mahi mahi taco, chicken adobo taco, and a muy thai. The chicken adobo taco blew me away. The chicken was so flavorful. Really captured the adobo like flavors. the mahi mahi taco was alright. It didn't have much tuna in it and the tuna was not that flavorful. Almost couldn't taste the fish. The muy thai was tasty. First time having one and it was stronger than I thought. I felt the alcohol afterwards haha.   My friend got the roasted brussel sprouts and potstickers. The potstickers were good, but nothing special. The brussel sprouts were fantastic though. They fried them and then put it in balsamic. I thought it tasted like a soy sauce base, but it was just balsamic. Best I've ever had. Also got a cheesecake with raspberry drizzle. It was so good! the cheese part was nice and creamy. It was not overly thick, which is good because it is huge.   Prices were not too bad for a place on the strip. This place has happy hour during many hours of the day. The earlier the time, the cheaper the food. It can get down to $4 an item (ie. a taco). Check it out! It's in New York New York."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great people. Good environment. Definitely recommended to eveyone. :)"}
{"text":"Hostess refused to have tables cleaned so we could dine outside.   Another couple left stating they didn't get any service.   Save your time - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. While all the buffets and other brunch spots on the strip have super long waits, we are always seated promptly. Good vibes, large portions, great food and drinks (plus bottomless mimosas), and excellent service. We had Ashly as our server and she is incredible--super friendly, nice, and attentive. This is our go-to spot for brunch in Vegas."}
{"text":"HIGHLY HATE THIS PLACE!!!  My husband worked here when they first opened. He had an issue with management wanting to deny him time off during Christmas (which was BEFORE they even opened) But no big deal, he already had another job anyways. Needless to say its been OVER a MONTH and he still has not seen his paycheck. Managers,even the GM AND the corporate center refuse to respond to him and help identify where is paycheck is or even reissue a new one. Even when they've admitted to have seen it. But im sure we'll see a W2 though -_-   THEN my mother and I happen to eat here about 2-3 weeks ago, after catching the show to Zummanity (which was awesome!) and the service was sooo slow! I asked the gal 3x for water and kept having to remind her for napkins. Not to mention the portions are small and the chicken was on the dry side :(    UGH!!! Between the servers' 'whatever-like' service, the over priced food, and the poor management, from an ex-employees experience, Im just soo done with this place!   NEVER WILL I EVER recommend anyone to dine here or even work here!  Especially when there are so many other options on the strip. I'll take my business else where"}
{"text":"OK, I totally F'D UP! We went here after show, and I wanted to eat healthy because it was late. The stupidest thing I ever did!  As I am sitting in front of the most BLASE dry spinach salad, with boiled tasteless shrimp scattered around the edge of my plate, and everyone around me is raving about their hamburgers, steak sandwiches, and even tacos I realized....  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO EAT HEALTHY! What was I thinking? OH Vanity...I CURSE YOU!  Let me tell you, I will not make that mistake again here! Next time I am going to roll around in delicious fried goodness until my heart stops! Don't try and stop me!!  And I suggest you do the same, you will love your meal as much as the 5 people I was sitting with loved theirs!"}
{"text":"Chris was a really good sever n the food us fuckin bomb. Try the korean bbq burger is the shit. Come to the spot when u come to vegas"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. The service is very slow. Bloody Mary tastes great, but the food we ordered - taco is too spicy, salad is huge portion and egg Benedict tastes good but a bit too much grease."}
{"text":"They have bottomless Mimosas and a great view of the front side of the strip. I order the chicken with the cornbread pancake. It was decent but it gave me heartburn like no other."}
{"text":"I had one of the best experiences ever during lunch at Tom's Urban today. I decided to eat out on the patio so that I could enjoy the view and also people after all this \"Vegas\" right!! I had the pleasure of having Jez as my bartender. Not only did she make me the perfect \"spicy\" bloody bourbon Mary she also made some excellent suggestions as to what I should have for lunch. My nephew had the Lobster Mac & Cheese which is \"to die for\" I started to order the same thing but Jez twisted my arm and recommended the jalapeño bacon burger and OMG the best burger I've had in a while. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection with just the right flavors and just the right kick from the jalapeños. If your in Vegas I highly recommend you try Toms Urban for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!!"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss on the service, but the location, outdoor seating, and food is unmatched in the area.  If it's not sweltering and you want a great lunch with a side of people-watching, you can't beat Tom's.  Understand that everything will come out slower than you might want, but use that extra time to have another beer and enjoy the scenery.  Beer on tap selection is great, lots of variety on the menu, and every day there's a different flavor of house-made pop tart."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Nice atmosphere. New spot at NYNY. We will definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"You know I really liked this place especially the ambiance with the constant music videos playing and just in general how the place is laid out and organized. Definitely a late night Foodie spot with many different types of food on the menu from Chinese, Mexican & American. What really stood out was how welcoming everyone was. Hostess was friendly and our server Joey was Awesome. He gave us recommendations, told us what his favorites were and made us feel really comfortable. Definitely a place I could be a regular at. Onto the food! We didn't risk trying some of their cooler dishes, I know, we're crazy but we were both so hungry that we chose stuff that we knew we could be satisfied with.   Truffle, Portabello & Swiss Burger w/ Garlic Shoestring fries: definitely a much bigger portion than expected when ordering from a restaurant on the strip. Was cooked to a perfect medium rare as I requested, bun was soft yet held it's integrity, Swiss was melted to perfection and the truffle didn't overwhelm it. The garlic fries were also flavorful, a little on the oily side but I like them like that.  Filet Mignon & Eggs: Tender steak, hashbrows had a perfect crust on them with light heat, and the blackberry jam paired perfectly with the sourdough.   Tom's Cup in Tom's Size (basically double sized): Beefeater gin, strawberry, cucumbers, mint and lime. My boyfriend and I love all these flavors so it was a perfect drink for us. Sweet yet could still enjoy the gin. Definitely had us feeling good lol  Also, this place has a good Happy hour! M-F 3-7pm and Sun-Thurs 11pm- Close:  $3 Fireball shots  $5 select drafts  $6 well drinks  $4 urban street tacos $4 sticky belly steamed buns   I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in vegas... if only I went to Wendy's I would be so much happier which is across the street. I have very low food standards. The burger was black, my girlfriends taco was so dry it was as if she out baby powder in her mouth. Honestly I wouldn't go to this place ever again."}
{"text":"The food was not very hot when it came out. I believe they waited for one of the sides to be cooked because the side of Brussels sprouts were hot but nothing else was. And the taco shells tasted and felt old. When you folded it, they cracked and fell apart"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here. It was really good. My husband had the lemon, blueberry, poppy seed pancakes and I got the buttermilk pancakes. They were both so good! The waitress was great and she kept the bottomless mimosa's coming."}
{"text":"We were seated for 10 minutes before getting attended to.  After ordering it took a ridiculous amount of time to get our lunches.  2 pm light traffic in place, 6 tables....birds inside restaurant....fruit flies everywhere"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar from Wes.   The food was great, the burrito and that the Cubano sandwich were excellent.   Good selection of beer although I would like to see more local craft breweries selection.   Please support local breweries.  Would return."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. They were out of items. Meaning we had no specialized dip for our appetizers (which was our reason for ordering the item). It wasn't until we asked where the dips were that we are informed they were out. No comps, no apologies. Waitress also didn't have knowledge of beers offered. She didn't look new; She just looked like she didn't care."}
{"text":"We ate here last month. It was awful! Our spinach salad was a pile of spinach with tiniest bit of tomatoes and dressing. The ribs were so greasy! The side of BBQ sauce had a top coat of grease. The fries did not have much of a potato flavor. My stomach was upset after the meal. I don't know how this place will survive with all the great food spots in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good drinks and drink selection. Very average burger, with more bun than meat and toppings. Brussel sprouts are pretty good. Sweet potato fries were overcooked and lukewarm. Nothing special. Much better places to go while in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate here 3 times during our last stay in Vegas.  It was awesome.  Our first and second meals were breakfast,  the omelettes were perfect, we got the kale salad instead of the hash browns, delicious.  Our bloody mary's and coffee were both way above par.    After the UFC fights a large group of us went there for dinner and had another awesome meal.  The service was fast and smooth and everyone enjoyed their meal.  If you are near New York New York, give them a try."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5.  The chopped salad consisted of a heaping pile of cabbage with an avocado sliced on top, 5 small chunks of chicken, and slivers of bacon.  The dressing was on the side and so hot that it was almost not enjoyable.  There was not a piece of lettuce in this salad, and no eggs.  The pot sticker salad was the same way with 4 pot stickers sitting on top.  It came with 3 dipping sauces and each one was hotter than the next.  The shrimp salad was a pile of spinach with 8 small shrimp.  It was missing the avocado and anything else it was supposed to have.  The wings were good.  Very messy.  Probably wouldn't go back.  Not a good value for the money."}
{"text":"This place is a great stop on the strip for some feel good food, especially on a late night after drinking a few cocktails.  I am a fan of their simple chicken sandwich and flatbreads.  I'd definitely head back again to try their housemade pop tarts and some breakfast items."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb!  I am proud to say that I have now eaten at all three Tom's Urbans and this one takes the (pineapple upside down) cake for sure.    The seating area is open and hip and the team of servers are super friendly.    We sat at the Strip Side bar and had killer cuban sandwich and sweet potato fries.  Both were delish as was the shrimp avacado salad.  It is like a deconstructed Shrimp Louis without being drowned in dressing.    YUMYUMYUM!  Be Back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Gotta try the duck wings and the lobster shrimp Mac & cheese! So good. Large selection of specialty drinks too."}
{"text":"What an awesome time my wife and I had at Tom's Urban located in New York New York! Customer service provided my the astoundingly friendly Mike was out of this world, as he managed to give accurate descriptions of meals, personal opinions and in depth information about the restaurant and its history. Right off the bat, we began having a great visit. The food was delicious and smelled like heaven too. I would highly suggest this restaurant to a friend!"}
{"text":"Service was not good. Food was better but I waited to long. Seating is unusual at the round boths. Not comfortable while waiting for your order. I say skip this place and try other food place."}
{"text":"I can't explain the huge disparity of reviews for this place. All I can relate to you is our experience here for breakfast on 7/7/15 - and it was great!  The host at the lectern outside seated us right away. We requested seating inside, as it was already blazing hot outside. This guy had a lot of tattoos and long hair and looked like a rocker, but despite the gruff appearance, he was SO friendly and nice, we warmed up to him immediately. And our server was a doll; very attentive, brought us waters and drinks right away, went over the menu and gave good feedback on the many, many options.   I forget what hubby ordered but he liked it a lot. It was some commonplace breakfast fare. I ordered a veggie omelet which was huge, and I gave most of it to my husband. It was delicious, albeit a tad too buttery for me.   Portions were large and, we thought a great value for the prices charged.  A shout-out to the interior decor and color scheme. We really loved the vibe here: soft, cool aquas and warm ambers, suspended glass orb lighting, wood planks as art panels on the wall... it all made for a soothing, warm dining environment. A nice change of pace from the frenetic neon decors of the Strip. And it was cool how the exterior wall to the Strip was totally opened up, so this was more of an inside-outside space. Very airy and open and large.   We loved this place and our meal here and agreed, we'd definately return."}
{"text":"First time here and mad at myself for not hitting this place up earlier. Great strip people watching location and fantastic food. Great craft cocktails and fresh ingredient food. Prices are amazing for quality of food. Best part was the service. SAM R. Was our waitress and she is so amazing.  Ask for her if you come- best food and service ever. My new fav!"}
{"text":"Tons urban is good bar/restaurant.  If you stumble upon the giant orange martini glass you take a selfie you can get $2 off your order.   Our server Victoria was super sweet and helpful picking out a drink.   I joked with her she's super strong because i couldn't open the shaker to pour more of my drink. She opened with ease lol. I swear I wasn't drunk yet haha.  I had the peach Cosmo which was (super expensive) really really good!!! My experience with cosmopolitans isn't a good one but I tried  the Peach Martini here and it was delicious!!! *pic included   With the yelp app we got brussel sprouts for free with our drink. And boy oh boy were they good!!! So make sure you check in!!!  I took off a star because our interaction with the first server wasn't the best my cousin was highly disappointed. She wasnt much help in info on what was offered. So once Victoria came over it was a breath of fresh air and or experience enhanced 10 fold!  Basically if you're looking for a good drink and a free app stop here along your way down the strip."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Tom's Urban early on Tuesday evening. We liked the decor and the opportunity to sit outside for dinner. Our server Charles was extremely courteous and professional. Our food and drinks were amazing. The manager came to check on us as well. If I lived in Vegas I would definitely be back regularly, but it looks like it will have to wait until I am in town again. Thanks for the great service, food, and dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating, but that's it.  Service is terrible. We ordered several different items. Everything came at the same time. Sandwich, salads and few appetizers and of course the apps were cold.  We ordered a ginger soda. The sever didn't tell they don't offer it and went and poorer it from \"the bar area\" and came in 6oz glass.  After one refill we had to pay $12.45 for it. Her explanation was that they don't have a Bartender for the servers today and she had to go to the bar and get it from there. Didn't bring all this the to the management. They looked very careless about everything anyway.  One lady came out of no where and ask as how was everything without presentation of who she is etc. just send her away with quick ok.  Her clothes were covered with bunch of anal hair and i even didn't want to talk to her.  We live in Vegas and we go out at least few Times a week and for Vegas standards this place its a disappointment. Sorry"}
{"text":"Basic Breakfast in large room with bar and TVs visible.  Nice waitress (Carmen) but forgot my toast.  And there was no kale in my $2 additional side kale salad.  There are many other options in this hotel but I guess for a family this large eating area would be nice. No wifi"}
{"text":"It's like an over priced Yardhouse. Slightly better ingredients but overall.. very inconsistent in execution and flavor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great location, great waiters, great drink selection. The hummus, Brussel sprouts, and edamame are amazing. The BBQ chicken sliders were OK. P.O. Boy sliders were good, too. The only reason I give 4 stars is because the hostess was snobby, we had to wait a long time before being asked for our drink order, and the sliders tasted a little old."}
{"text":"Although it took a little while to find a spot to sit during brunch hour, we got great seats at the bar and had great service. Our server was able to let us sample a few great locals beers and made great Bloody Mary's. The food was a little expensive, but the portions were great. It is in the heart of the strip so you can't complain about price. We will come back. Great food and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I tried the bacon avocado burger and it was just okay. The kale side salad it came with was the single most flavorless salad I've ever eaten at a restaurant. I also tried some of the prime rib cheesesteak and it was nothing special. The au jus it came with was really thick which just didn't go right with the sandwich. I also had the duck wings which were made with a basic hoisin sauce, also nothing special. The only part of this restaurant that I really liked was their decor."}
{"text":"Carmen our service is the best waitress ever, she helped us navigate their busy menu and directed us in the best way possible. The drinks at tom urban were perfect, service ten out of ten and the food is fantastic and perfect location on the strip! Thank you Carmen"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! We started with the fried pickles, ordered the Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Chz, the Cuban sandwich and the Prime Rib French Dip. I tasted all & all were delicious. Also Sami is a great server. This should be on the short list of where to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My dad suggested we try Tom's Urban as were always looking for new places. there were so many items we wanted to order. i had to adobo chicken green chili burrito and LOVED it.   My dad is on this crazy diet right now and can make eating out a pain in the ass. He asked our waitress (Geri) several questions and she checked with the kitchen on several occasions to see how they could accommodate my dads requests. I was impressed that she didn't seem irritated at all (I work in F&B and would have been so pissy with my dad at this point). She was very helpful, patient and attentive. I normally wouldn't have written a review if this were a normal dining experience with delicious food. Geri was great and what made our night exceptional. THank you for all of your help! Dad says that when he is off of this diet this will probably become a regular spot based on the great service, location and great menu selection. I promise he won't be such a pain next time"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and good portions, however service is slow.  Our waitress sucked, not attentive.   Asked if we could get space heaters on for outside and told no.  Weather was in the low 70's with a chill factor"}
{"text":"5 Stars, 5 Stars, 5 Stars for Tom's Urban! My coworkers and I stopped in here while in Vegas for a conference. We had the most wonderful dining experience. Cocktails were out of this world! I tried the Sin City and the the Tom's Cup and they were both refreshing and sassy enough to have a silly walk back to Caesar's Hotel. The owner, Tom came by and made us feel so welcome. He made some excellent recommendations. The Cheddar Avocado Mashies are sinfully delicious. The staff treated us like movie stars and really knew the menu like the back of their hands! We had such a great time at Tom's that we went back again the next day! Great food, great atmosphere, affordable and family friendly!! Will definitely be back here ASAP and highly recommend it to EVERYONE on the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"The price is a bit pricey but it's in the NY NY so what can you expect had the Buffalo sliders they were delicious ate every last bite. Our bartender/waitress was awesome her drinks were on point. They have a very unique menu."}
{"text":"The only novel thing about this bar & restaurant is that they play music videos on their TVs in addition to sports. The food rates at the high end of average. The beer selection is pretty good. Service was friendly, but not very timely, even with what seemed to me plenty of staff and not all that many customers."}
{"text":"When we first walked in I saw some people unhappy but when we sat down the whole experience changed. Emanuel change everything around and made our experience amazing! I had the club sandwich (super refreshing) and my partner in crime had pork belly... he said they were fantastic!! Come eat"}
{"text":"3.5 bumped up to a 4.  Legit breakfast. Maybe like a fancy upscale Dennys that serves wiked good Bloody Mary's and has over 21  beers on tap.  Ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict, they were perfect. Opted for the side of asado hash browns, which ended up to be about half cup of cooked hash browns with a melted white cheese on top... good but slightly out of the ordinary.   Also shared the fig and three cheese panini, went for the piggy figgy (with bacon) which ended up meaning bacon in the panini and on the side... not sure if that's how it comes or if our waiter was off. Delish. Recommend sharing as it came with 3 halves and a side..  pick sweet potatoe fries!!  Also they have \"toms sized\" drinks. We didn't see the size differences listed on the menu so we asked our waiter what the difference was. He just said \"the size\"... Yea dude we get that part, but like the differences in ounces?? Ohhhhh, 22 vs. 16 oz. So think of Tom's size as a Venti, or about a Venti sized glass of alcoholic goodness.   They also have urban pop tarts. We missed out since they sold out, the waiter told us they were making more. But didn't give us the option to order when they were ready. Too bad!"}
{"text":"I am not commenting on the quality of food or service but find the restaurant's  self description didn't meet my expectation so I didn't eat there.   Before deciding to go to Tom's Urban, I read the restaurant description promoting itself \"serving an eclectic blend of the world's favorite street food.\" When I got to the restaurant and looked over the menu, it offered sliders, pizzas and street tacos. When I read \"world's favorite street food\" I had entirely different expectations and was expecting more international fare. I come from the perspective of having traveled abroad and eaten street food and was expecting something similar. My bad for having this expectation."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sports bar I have ever encountered in Las Vegas, which is saying a lot. I can't comment on the food, unfortunately, since the hostess decided to completely disregard my reservation and give me serious attitude. Long story short, I made a reservation requesting a view of the Golden Knights playoff game...in Vegas...I was lied to online and on the phone. The hostess put us in a corner, no view of the TV, and told me my only option was sitting there or leaving. Look, you don't want my business, that's fine...just don't lie to me on the phone or waste my time. Tom's Urban sucks, especially the hostess."}
{"text":"Amazing food. But service leaves a lot to be desired. Got the wrong order the first time which I get stuff happens and wasn't even mad about it. But one of the misters above our outside table was broken and water dropped on me, in my drinks and in my food the whole time. I told them about it and they offered to move us after we were already done. Not very great service if you ask me. Get it to go"}
{"text":"My family & I really wanted to go to Tom's Urban at L.A. Live. We even made a reservation for dinner. But, after reading reviews about how bad service was & it was really slow, I cancelled our reservation.  Here we are in Vegas & we decided to give it a try & hopefully it will be better here in Vegas....NOT!. We got seated right away, the place wasn't even full or busy. But, OMG, the service was sooo SLOW. We were waiting for almost 40 mins for our food. We asked our waiter how much longer. He said, let me check on it.....3 mins later he came out w/ our food. It's probably been ready for a while but was not served to us immediately coz our food was served lukewarm to cold. My daughter said her French toast was cold. My BLT lobster roll was already soggy, probably coz it wasn't served soon enough. The reviews I read about overall TERRIBLE SERVICE are true! I will not recommend this place at all & will not have any desire to come back."}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas with five friends during March Madness. We went to Shake Shack for a quick, casual lunch -- but there was an hour-long line there. Since the menu at Tom's Urban looked interesting (and because there was no wait to be seated), we decided to check it out. Mistake -- BIG mistake. If Tom's Urban was entered into the NCAA Tournament of Bad Service, they would be the Kentucky Wildcats of the restaurant industry. Their servers and managers were a combination of slow, inattentive, ignorant and disinterested.  At one point, we were pretty sure we were the \"before\" crowd of one of those reality TV shows about restaurants on the verge of closing because  of incompetent service. Bottom line: I will never visit one of their restaurants again...and I learned the lesson that...we should have waited the hour for Shake Shack. In keeping with the basketball theme and quoting Sir Charles: \"turble.\""}
{"text":"Great place, excellent service, food is great. They even gave us cups for the leftover beverage. And they where very quick."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food or with my drinks. The margaritas were all sweet and sour and no tequila.  I ordered the cuban sandwich and was not pleased at all. Huge letdown. My partner was also not happy with their meal. Now dont get me wrong, the patio is AWESOME and the location is great but the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and both food and drinks were a disappointment. We ordered the lobster Mac & cheese which tasted like frozen lobster and very poor quality. I also ordered a Moscow mule which wasn't too good. The ginger beer they use overpowered the entire drink. The waitress brought us stained napkins which we had to ask for a replacement. The location is good and it has nice decor but the food and drinks made it so I'd never return."}
{"text":"My experience here was a disaster.  So here goes the story...  We saw this place walking around the strip and checked out menu and it looked good so for our last meal in LV we decided to go here. We were seated right away outside with a nice view which was great, well it went downhill from there. Our waiter came and my sister and I were deciding what to get in our omelet and apparently 5 seconds was longer than he wanted to wait because he just left.  He eventually came back and we ordered. My sister and I were going to share an omelet and sweet potato fries.  My son ordered the cheeseburger  with garlic fries and my mom ordered a coke and also sweet potato fries.  The waiter wrote this down and left.  We waited over 25 minutes for our food and when it came my son had sweet potato fries instead of garlic and they forgot mine.  We told the guy who brought the food and he said no problem he will take care of it.  We also asked him for an extra plate being that we were sharing.  We never saw this guy again.  He obviously had no intention of helping nor did he relay the message to our waiter.  So we had to track our waiter down and tell him the problem and asked for a plate.  Well, it took 2 more times and  over 10 minutes to get that plate.  Then our waiter brought my son his garlic fries and we told him we still had not received our sweet potato fries.  He gave us attitude then came back with more garlic fries. Seriously WTF.  We were so annoyed.  He finally got it right, but not without making sure we knew he was annoyed, but its not our fault he got the order wrong in the first place grr.  My mom never got her coke either he totally forgot.  The food was ok, our toast was cold when it arrived. I also forgot to mention my son wanted a milk shake, but he said the machine was broken and suggested we go next store to Shake Shack,  C'mon really--get it together  We really wanted this meal to be good seeing as it was our last one of our trip, but it was a disaster.  This waiter had no social skills and really sucked at his job.    On a positive note, my son said his food was good and the sweet potato fries were yummy.  Plus, the location is nice.  However, I would never go back after the experience we had."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban has been on my \"to-eat\" list for a while now. I like to play and stay every so often at the New York New York Hotel & Casino and have walked pass this place way too many times. Just recently I decided let's end the procrastination! I arrived the other night just in time for Happy Hour! Score! On top of that there was no wait and we were seated right away! Our server was Eddie (I think that's his name) for the evening. He was great! There is nothing more that I appreciate than an attentive and honest server. When you are able to provide your own personal favorites on the menu as well as let the dining customers know what's not so good you get plenty cool points with me. Since I've never been there were two items I inquired about one being the full rack of ribs and the other the lobster roll. Both of these were explained to be \"just ok\" for taste. My theory is if I am going to pay extremely crazy prices for food I better be getting something damn delicious and well above \"just ok\". I finally made my mind up to eventually order the BBQ Bacon Jalapeno Burger Double Down Style which means double the meat and cheese! Score! With a side of sweet potato fries? Yeah I was in there like swimwear! Mouth just watered after ordering. To kill the immediate hunger me and my partner in crime decided to order the Hummus dip off the happy hour menu! If you are a hummus lover please do yourself a favor and get this to start! You won't regret it! When the burgers came out they looked amazing! My plate was just everything I thought it would be. The second burger that was ordered was the \"Sin City\" with a side of the garlic fries. Now I had to dock them a star on the fries on that plate because they were ridiculous! Cold! And you could tell they've been sitting. They lost even more points because when we brought it to our server's attention he took the plate of fries and returned within maybe 2 minutes? We are no fools I know that chef or whoever was in the kitchen just put those same fries in the hot grease and returned them to us. You can tell the difference between a fresh batch of fries or what was reheated..  After everything I still wanted desert and opted for their signature cheesecake with some raspberry sauce and whipped cream. To-go though because the burger was huge! All in all this was a pretty good visit and really enjoyed the burgers. I've heard brunch is great so I will be back to see what that's all about soon!"}
{"text":"Sadly, never coming back here again. Food was great.. Service was at best subpar. Paid $3 extra to receive 6 more ounces of beer, part of which spilled out before he delivered to my table and two inches were missing from the glass. Ordered fries which were supposed to come with two sides of specialty ketchup, never came and had to ask for it. Asked our server as well as food deliverer for water (mind you its 90+ degrees), never got it and had to ask a third time. Ordered a second round of drinks and it took THIRTY minutes to get them. Once checks came of course our server was all over it trying to get the money on HIS time. Mind you, this is a Wednesday at noon that we sat down and this was a table of two. I work in tips and can not believe the lack of frequency to see how we were doing or if we needed anything - especially during slow hours. Server was great when he was here, but sadly it wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Great Service.  The shrimp from the \"shrimp n grits\" are Bomb!! I recommend the edamame! And the husband enjoyed the duck wings."}
{"text":"Had a great time at toms and the bar staff was extremely pleasant. We went in for Saturday lunch and though I don't remember the bartenders name she took great care of us and was super hospitable(even though she is a Denver Broncos fan lol).   The manager checked in and was also super nice. The drinks tasted great and the food was also very tasty. I had the chop salad, super shareable for two, the hummus was delicious and super fresh as well, and the dumplings with hoisin sauce to compliment.   I would say only downfall is he bathroom area. Restaurant is so nice but the bathroom needs a revamp. It's not a deal breaker.   They had so many areas to sit at and three bars for drinks to consume. I will definitely be back for my next visit. Great job and hope people appreciate good service and great food. Toms Urban has me sold, I will definitely check out the LA location when I get back home. Hopefully it's just as great."}
{"text":"Dinner here was probably the worst experience I've had in Vegas this far. The service is ridiculous, we sat for over an hour at a table directly in front of the bar yet waiting for the check, being completely ignored by the staff even though the restaurant was almost completely empty. Service like that is never excusable but we wouldn't have been as mad if the food was good, but it was awful too. The garlic fries were thin and completely tasteless, the pizza was average at best, and the $8.50 Bud light draft was warm. Would recommend ANYWHERE else over this place, seriously walk down the street to Denny's and I'm sure you'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"cannot recommend  servicer was good.... but, bloody Mary not good, Caesar salad with chicken not a Caesar at all and chicken .... well weird."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with a great menu. The restaurant sits both inside the hotel, and also on the Park side of the hotel. Menu features bar and grill type food with a huge beer menu. Staff was very knowledgeable and attentive. I tried the fried pickles and a burger. The pickles were fresh and better than average. I would recommend the tater tots as a side to your burger.   The restaurants has a sports vibe with lots of tv screens. But I wouldn't classify as a sports bar. When I came for lunch on a Sunday it was very busy."}
{"text":"This place is quite average. The menu is all over the place with burgers, tacos, fake Asian food and some made up dishes. Beer list seems average. I would neither recommend Tom's nor dissuade someone from visiting. Though I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Tom's."}
{"text":"@new York New York hotel. They have late night happy hour starting at 11 pm. I believe 7$ food selection and 6$ select drinks, until 2am. Every hour gets cheaper by the dollar until 2. Drinks are good, as good as they can be anywhere else. I ordered the fried pickles and Brussels sprouts. It was way, way too salty."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Service was great, food was great. No physical kids menu but they do offer kids meals, like a cheese pizza or Mac n cheese if you ask them, which I did having our little one with us. She ended up sharing our entrees. The setting is open and clean.  Entrees: XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken- chicken bites battered crispy, swapped out the fries for tots. Dipping sauces were tasty especially the rosemary lemon aioli. Chimichurri Steak and Frites- medium rare steak bites, very tender with tasty sauce, garlic shoestring fries. We will return next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits was amazing! I went for restaurant week and it was well worth the money"}
{"text":"Food was ok but atrocious service. Super slow and we had to bring the check to the server in order to leave"}
{"text":"Food is just gross, cold. You have to wait a long time to get your food but the people are relatively nice. Would not recommend ever."}
{"text":"Saturday morning brunch around 10:30. Buddy and I both ordered the Urban Platter ... sausage, hash browns, eggs over easy, toast. Pretty basic. Except eggs were cold, hash brown was less than luke warm as was the sausage. Waitress kindly took it back. 2nd time same thing. We let the manager know that we were leaving and why. He was thoughtful enough to apologize and not charge us for the coffee. So overall service was good but ... food not so much. Kind of a key element."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today! Food is ok. I ordered urban breakfast platter. My wheat bread is super dry..even with butter on it. Hash brown is bland and dry as well. Inside of the restaurant is hot. Our waitress is a little bit of a smart ass. I asked for a napkins since there's only two and there's 4 of us. She told me she thought there's only 2 of us eating, Duh! She came back with 4 napkins and said \" I brought 2 more extras\". Like, great! I'll make an extra mess:p.  I don't think this place is a 4 star. Food and service are not that great. Just to be honest!"}
{"text":"My plate had hair on it. My omelette was greasy and weird textured and the cheese inside was not melted. I just don't get the good reviews. Bleh."}
{"text":"Went in with a party of 6 @ 4:30 pm for Happy Hour. They had us seated just short of the outside patio and boy was it LOUD.. We asked to be seated inside and they took care of it for us. Patio seemed full and very few tables in the restaurant at that early hour. After taking our drink order we didn't get them for about 15 min. Worry some. Turns out that was the last glitch of our evening.  We had 8 appetizers, enough for everyone to get at least a taste.  1. Colorado Calimari. Anaheim and Fresno chilis made it tasty. Calamari fried nicely. 2. Ginger Chicken pot stickers (5). These were very tasty and not dry with a sweet dipping sauce. 3.French Fries two ways: garlic fried and cinnamon sweet potatos. Not a fan of the spice on the sweet potato fries.  4.Mini Carnitas Mac n Cheese. My favorite dish. Carnitas shredded and cooked with the large spiral mac n cheese and green chilis. Baked in a small skillet and served bubbling hot.  5. Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. Steamed buns filled with sticky pork belly, Asian peanut slaw, cilantro, green onion. The buns were of good quality, well made. 6. Filet Mignon Sliders. (2). Tasty, tender meat, brioche bun, an asian peanut slaw with cilantro, and onion.  7. Al Carbon steak nachos. a HUGE plate of tortilla chips and lots of cheese with sliced Angus beef, pico de gallo, fresh jalapeños, sides of cilantro crema, sour cream and Guac. ( I could not find the guac?) 8. Buffalo Wings. (5) We had these but without the spices as we had sensitive some palettes. Wings fried perfectly served with a ranch sauce carrots and celery.  After the slow start the server was very attentive and we didn't feel rushed or harried.   Side note: the salad courses on the menu were huge and I would order the  Avocado Shrimp  Roasted chilled shrimp, baby spinach, chopped hard-boiled egg, tomato, cucumber, avocado, fried capers, remoulade dressing. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Lindo local, bien puesto, da a la calle en New York New York, con la vista al mini puente de Brooklyn. Lo mejor es sentarse en las mesas de ese mini-balcón, aunque también tienen mucho espacio adentro.  La comida es buena, los flatbreads muy copados y las hamburguesas poderosas (sin city burgers!). Los sliders vienen medio flojitos, pero bueno, compensan con los tacos, que son abundates.  Para tomar tienen lo normal, cervezas tiradas, importadas, pero tambien algunos ponches y tragos copados. El High Roller es buenisimo, refrescante y frutal, ideal para el clima de Vegas.  La atención es correcta, nos fueron cambiando de mozo durante la comida, y uno de ellos nos apuró más de lo deseado con la cuenta, pero fuera de eso todo bien."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Fine place for family friends or a night cap. Food is awesome especially the NYNY."}
{"text":"Ambience and setting are great sitting outside on strip right at the entrance to the golden knights hockey team tail gate. The food, meh take a pass. Although the menu is alluring with the offering, I found each item ordered lacking.  Item one was the Mexican grilled street corn. This had a peculiarly foul taste as the corn was frozen. The lobster sandwich was a rip off. Barely any lobster but tons and tons of lettuce bacon and my god the freakin bread was like a full loaf. My wife had the steak tacos which too were average.   Worst of this experience was the service. Horrible. Brought wrong beer twice and barely could find her. We waited and waited and waited.  Need an overhaul here of food quality and service."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the game ordered some drink (expensive) and their steak nachos and let me just say the steak nachos were GARBAGE practically no cheese Dry tortilla Chips and literally, I shit you NOT FOUR (4) pieces of steak worst guacamole EVER and bartender was super dead and was on his iPhone instead of asking how the food and drinks were. I'm very disappointed :("}
{"text":"We went on the opening week to see the Park, and stopped at Tom's Urban to enjoy the people watching. I had some sort of burrito with a Thai themed food, our friend had calamari and my husband had bbq chicken sliders. We had a senior waiter who was very rushed and a new trainee. The food was ok and staff were nice, but just as in Malibu, you are in a fun spot for the view, it is crowded, and the food is all right. Being locals our expectations are extremely high for there are so many off-Strip gems and world class chefs to please our palates. We would come back if we had newcomers because the staff really make the place: problem is they seem pretty overworked."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly and attentive staff. The Fig Jam and Triple Cheese grilled sandwich was super yummy."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this hot spot on the strip. Friendly staff and good food. I'll probably go a few times while I'm here! Fried pickles are really good!"}
{"text":"So we had a voucher for a buy one get one free beer so that's what brought us into Toms urban. We decided to sit outside so we could view the strip. The hostess sat us and we sat there for like 10 minutes and no one helped us. (Similar to Kristina's issue above) After waiting all that time we decided to just move to the bar and order. We didn't end up just getting the beer, our check was $80+. Food was good, don't get the buffalo wings. They were overpriced by double in my opinion. Mini mac n cheese pot was delicious. And Elaine was very helpful and friendly! She made the first incident disappear :)"}
{"text":"Awesome location right on the strip and located next to the action. Awesome server and the menu has so many options. I would recommend this place for a great bite to eat while in Vegas Baby!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place 20$ mimosas extra very strong also can't go wrong for Vegas I recommend !"}
{"text":"Had the Queso Fundiodo  (pablano chili) to start. It was great combining it with the prime rib Philli cheese steak dip. Which was out of thus world GREAT."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I come before every Knights game. So disappointed in the service tonight. No happy hour due to March Madness, I get that. Milk the tourists for all you can, Lol. Ivan, our bartender, wasn't nice at all. Never cracked a smile or said thank you. I tipped him 15% but I usually tip 30%."}
{"text":"The duck wings are great., with the spicy flavor embedded in the sweetness. The all American burger is cooked to my order, but it is just OK. The lobster shrimp macNcheese is a little grease, but does have a lot of lobster meat and shrimps. The butcher steak is totally pver cooked, and not hot at all when it is served. Our waiter is very friendly and ask the kitchen for  replacement. Our foods come in very slowly, and my kids asked me a thousand times when our food will be here. The overall service is ok, and foods are good."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place more. The menu looked amazing, it looked like a really cute hip new gastropub-esque place.  I went there for brunch with my fiancé on a Sunday. That was my first mistake: going anywhere on a Sunday afternoon. I'm really not a football fan and toms urban is right next to the NY NY sports book so of course the rowdy fans trickle into the bar to get drinks and scream at the TV over men in spandex. I just don't get football fans and I couldn't escape the game. It was on every TV in the restaurant and I think there were at least ten big screens. Anyway- The staff was nice enough but the service wasn't really that great. It wasn't that busy and it took five minutes for our server to even greet us and about ten minutes for my bloody to get to me (I was sitting right by the bar). The server forgot our napkins which wasn't a big deal but it's something worth noting when the GM had to fetch us napkins instead of our server.  On top of the staff being sort of inattentive they only serve bottomless mimosas till 1 pm, and after that a mimosa is $13. I know it's the strip but $13 for a single mimosa? A glass of champagne was between $6-$8 so why the extra 7 dollars just to add a splash of juice?? It seemed very strange to me. While on the topic of drinks they do have a lot of beers on tap, some of them local which impressed me. Always gotta support your local breweries!  The menu as mentioned earlier is spectacular. They have all day breakfast, small plates, and entrees. I ended up getting the green chile carnitas Mac & cheese pot with crispy Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was so good, cheesy without being too rich. And the carnitas was very tender and flavorful. The Brussels had a balsamic glaze and were excellent. I'm so glad to see Brussels coming back in popularity. My fiancé ordered the pickle brine fried chicken with garlic shoestring fries. I would say it's the best friend chicken I've ever next to blue ribbon fried chicken. The pickle brine was perfect and the green chile remoulade was excellent for dipping.  I would probably come back here again if a friend wanted to go with me, but definitely NOT on any Sunday's between now and February."}
{"text":"tried their chocolate milkshake and pickle brined fried chicken.   their fried chicken was overly,  loverly dry and flavorless - i was so disappointed... should've gotten the lobster mac and cheese instead... the portion size was amazing tho ... i think it was a pound of chicken? a bargain for vegas indeed! if only it were edible....   their fries on the other hand - utterly amazing! super super oily, but the garlic flavor was spectacular!   their chocolate milkshake was dreamy - so worth the 8$ lol"}
{"text":"Go see Eddie at Tom's Urban. He's the best and you and can't beat the brussel sprouts!!  If you like a little spice- don't forget to try the spicy edamame and the peppers in the Colorado calamari.  Gin and juice taste great with everything!"}
{"text":"First eatery on our Vegas trip. Came at happy hour and it was pretty quiet. Has beat the clock pricing. $4 at 4:00, $5 at 5:00 etc. Our server, Paige, was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is a relaxed, beer-focused, modern-dive-bar type place.   I stood by the hostess stand for a while until it was clear no one was coming, so I sat myself and the inside bar where it seemed a bit more quiet and relaxed. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday night, but this place was pretty empty and a fairly casual place, which is a nice departure from the glitz, glam, and LOUD that you normally find on the strip.   I was excited to see about 40 taps of draft beer. Of course, the beer was a little pricier than I am used to, but it was nice to drink something other than domestic bottles from the casino floor. I appreciated that they had a printed beer list that appeared to be up to date.   I ordered some steak nachos that were not that great. I mostly ate only the chips that had cheese baked on them, and left the other trimmings on the plate. The order is definitely large enough for 4 people to share as a hearty appetizer.  My server / bartender seemed like a really cool, chill person, but unfortunately I didn't get great service. It took a while for everything - from water, to put in a beer order, to put in a food order....I had to really intently watch her walk around the bar in order to eventually make eye contact.   It seems like with better food and service, this could have been a 3 or 4-star experience, but I was left wanting more."}
{"text":"Don't really know where to start because this has been the best experience so far. Each of us had something different and we all enjoyed our dishes. I will visit this spot again before I leave. I tried several others dishes and I hope to go with others again so we can share.    They had really good beer choices but NO HAPPY HOUR and that's the sad part because so many other places do."}
{"text":"I literally just left this restaurant... minutes ago.  I was super stoked to eat at this super cool looking restaurant.  It was after the awesome concert we went to at arena.  Has a great vibe when you first walk in. I had the lobster/shrimp mac and cheese... yum! Unfortunately, we had Ashley B. as our server.  She spent more time hanging out at the bar with her colleagues/boss than taking care of us.  Example,  we had finished our food and waited 5+ minutes for her to clear our plates and offer dessert. Yep... I wanted the pineapple upside down cake... I SUPER wanted this... she gave me the menu and went and sat at the bar again for 5ish minutes... I was so torked I changed my mind and left her a crap tip!  This is just an example of her attitude and behavior.  Now... I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's okay. Service was slow. Waitress tried very little. Food was okay. Sitting outside is okay, but be mindful of the sun, it bears down hot."}
{"text":"Food just ok. Kyle was our server and took great care of us. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I was in there yesterday eating, the food, staff and service were fantastic. The manager Danielle was phenomenal, she kept checking back often on our party to make sure everything was okay the entire time we were there. Our server Tiffany was absolutely fantastic, very knowledgable about the menu. If you're in town, I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"At the time, I didn't know I was spoiled with having one of three Toms Urban's in the United States, but somehow knowing that makes it much better. They have a lot of seating inside as well as some outdoor seating as well. Vegas doesn't have ideal weather much of the year so if they have it, take advantage of it!  I have been to the one in LA and the hometown location of Las Vegas. They both offer the same food and at roughly the same price. During my time here, I ordered a Hangover Slopper which sounded the most appealing with the burger, eggs, fries, and additional deliciousness that followed suit. I also ordered some beers, in which they have a pretty good selection for you to choose from. Our service was good with the occasional person checking up on us to see how our food was and if there was anything else that we needed throughout the night. It can be a bit pricy, so I wouldn't recommend coming here too often, but definitely a nice place you can enjoy one in a while."}
{"text":"I have been here so many and have had great experiences. That being said I have been here three times this visit to Las Vegas and our service has been terrible all three times! The food has still been solid, although I waited over an hour yesterday for a burrito and when it came out it was wrong...I am updating my review because as I write this I was told outside, \"the kitchen is backed up over an hour I can't help you right now!\" Wow, I guess it's starting to fall apart...I hope they get it back together but it's trending in the wrong direction."}

{"text":"Cool spot on the Vegas strip not your typical tourist trap they have  a great beer selection and variety of  food choices our server P was great very attentive and nice attitude we ordered the chicken wings down pretty good fried chicken and cashed in the free fries pickles (the wifes favorite). The drinks were ok happy hour so you know how that goes..."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban was a pleasant surprise I had previously bookmarked, but due mostly to very mixed reviews, had avoided. But we were checked into New York, New York. And being tired and hungry, we weren't too picky for a dinner choice.  Unlike other sports bars, Tom's Urban actually never get's to the point of being too loud for conversation. At least while we were there. And for the very first time, my wife followed my lead in the use of the free Yelp check-in items offered here. So we ended up with 2 free Brussels Sprouts appetizers to share between the 3 of us. Our youngest son joining us on this trip. And some amazing Brussels Sprouts they were! Everyone enjoyed them, and that's saying a lot for my wife and son who normally don't care for them. I've been a fan my entire life.  For our entrees, my wife went with the Baby Kale Grilled Chicken Salad. My son the 3 Steak \"Al Carbon\" Tacos. And for myself, the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake; which our helpful server stated was her favorite. We were all pleased with our choices, with my wife's only complaint being that the grilled chicken was a bit dry. My dish was amazing and I'd definitely consider ordering it again.   Tom's Urban, a very good choice for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Location : 5 If you're attending any event at the T-Mobile arena, MGM, NYNY or Monte Carlo this is in a great area, walking distance to everything.   Staff : 5  Staff is very friendly and helpful. We were there before the Knights first playoff game and we caught a lucky break and were able to order off the happy hour menu which had a cool concept  4pm-5pm : $4 drinks/5$food 5pm-6pm : $5 drinks/$6food 6pm-7pm : $6 drinks/$7 food Beat the clock!  Food : 3 I had the honey bbq sliders and my friend had the Philly cheesesteak and they were ok. The sauce in the honey bbq sliders overpowered every other flavor. Good beer options.  Will probably only drink next time and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is definitely of a quality pub.  You can get your salads for teh healthy, but also have plenty of pub items like pizza, nachos, burgers, and wings.  My favorite part about Tom's Urban is the sauces.  Fantastic dipping sauces from the Moroccan ketchup to the ghost pepper sauce on the wings.  This time around we had the ghost pepper wings and buffalo sliders.  The wings are killer.  They will burn your stomach for sure.  They will make you tear up.  They are exactly s I had hoped when ordering ghost pepper wings - 5/5.  The buffalo sliders were fine.  A little bland, plain with only celery and sauce on the chicken, but tasty nonetheless.  Beer selection definitely could be better.  I love the location and atmosphere - Tom's . Urban seriously could be a contender for best place to watch a game.  However, the beer selection is not good and doesn't tread past the usual macros.  A few good selections like Stone and Dogfish, but no rotating or even good local brews.  Food great, beer average, location terrific."}
{"text":"Food was cold and service non-existent. The server was aloof and dismissive. I had to borrow ketchup from the table next to me & waited 15 minutes for my pop tart to be heated up only to get it back cold. My husbands Bloody Mary was very good. Only thing worth the trip."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is the restaurant equivalent of The Replacements. No one actually works here, they just showed up and pretend to have jobs. It took ten minutes for a server to even realize we existed. And afterwards it was a rare thing to even see her.   Orange juice shows up in a small glass only half full and mimics the same price of other places that offer twice as much.   The Breakfast Burrito was hardly enough to make up for the service and experience I had, and at best is a few notches below homemade."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in Vegas with a New York  vibe. We ate outside with music and people watching. Enjoyed prime rib sliders and lobster / shrimp tacos- both excellent.  Extensive draft beer list with NY picks and others. We had a great time and highly recommend.  Our server Eddie was awesome and hospitable and very attentive"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after checkin in at New York New York. I was starving and was instantly taken by the hipster look of the place. Started with a Frozen Moscow Mule($23). I got a double which in retrospect, was too expensive. But very very good.   Xiang Xiang duck wings for an appetizer. They were perfectly crispy with a spicy finish that was not too much.  Then it was on to the Lobster and Shrimp Mac N Cheese!!! WTF  This was the creamiest Mac N Cheese that I have ever had.  Ever!!!! Loved every moment of it. The shrimp was cooked to perfection as well. Skimpy in the lobster though.   Would definitely come back but please be mindful. There drinks are a bit pricey for Vegas eateries."}
{"text":"Nashville Spicy Chicken and Mac and Cheese was amazing!"}
{"text":"???????????????????...???????????...???????????????????...???????????...???????????????????...???????????..."}
{"text":"Wife and I had brunch out at Tom's Urban.  We're able to sit on the patio.  It has great food and in a great location.   We shared some blueberry pancakes and the hangover slopper.  Both were really good.   Slopper was a little pricey for a breakfast burger but was delicious.    We are definitely going back to try dinner."}
{"text":"I like to go here for lunch.  This is nicely located on the strip at New York New York facing MGM Grand right next to Shake Shack.    The atmosphere is trendy/rustic.  TVs everywhere playing sports or music videos.  A popular place to be on a Friday.  The tables and booths along the wall are nice, but the booths in the middle of the floor were kind of strange.  It's circular shaped, and will probably only fit 6 people at the most.  Just my opinion, not used to these style of booths.    Favorites: Lobster Mac & Cheese and the spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken.    Spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken: fried chicken strips on another level!  super spicy and filled with dry rub spices.  Comes with parmesan garlic shoe string fries.  Super large portion that is shareable with 2 people.  Lobster Mac & Cheese:  Comes with portions or lobster and shrimp on a hot metal dish.  They are pretty generous with their seafood portions on their mac & cheese.    Not so favorite: steak in chimichurri sauce.  The steak was not tender at all, and a pain in the ass to cut.  There were very few pieces of the steak that was not chewy and somewhat good to eat, but it was tough for the most part.    Price: It's on the strip, so you may somewhat pay \"strip\" prices, but it's not too bad.  Cheaper than most places on the strip."}
{"text":"Bad service food not so good would not suggest this place at all no no no no costumer service was awful"}
{"text":"Yes!  That really sums it up.  We have been here before and my GF and I are huge fans of the Al Carbon Steak Nachos.  If you have never had them, you are seriously missing out.  They are made for 2 people as well.  This time we went with our usual share of nachos and added the buffalo Chicken sliders as well as the pork belly Mac and cheese.  WOW!  The sliders were perfect, just a hint of heat with a good tangy zesty sauce.  The pork in the Mac & Cheese was so tender and flavorful.  I would highly reccommend this place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"These 5 Stars Are for BEWARE NO stop do NOT pass go here. YES the location is prime but that's it. The service is horrible the food is disgusting. STOP now and find a different place. This place is only open because of their location. We arrived and were seated in a corner.....we waited patiently for about 15 minutes and NO ONE came to our table....finally after waiting I decided to go see if they over looked us...they did! An Asian girl with leopard print sweater approached me and said let me help you!! Great! But alas the server came to the table next to us and had a great conversation for 5 more minutes and walked away! Yes the table sat 10 minutes after us got service!!!  This place is not worth your time money or energy. The food sucks and the service is even worse. Go somewhere else like Back stage Deli open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I would rate this a five star and only wish I wasn't so hungry so I could have taken a picture. Tacos, a must. Polenta, a must. Eggs Benedict not so much. But what made this note worthy (since I hate yelp reviews) was they switched out my meal and set me up with the most yummy pork belly taco. Chester was our server and he. is. awesome.  When in Vegas, I would recommend toms urban!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Months later and I still can't forget the big ass egg roll! I will definitely make a stop here anytime I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wife and Had drinks here our first night in Vegas. The bar sits outside over looking the strip has a great energetic vibe and is great for people watching. Our last morning before we headed back to LA we had breakfast. We both ordered the same thing. Eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast. Good size portions and fresh. The highlight of the breakfast though had to be the hash browns. The only way to describe them is if you take mash potatoes added cheese rolled them up into a ball, smashed them flat and then fried them. Soooo delicious! Ended the meal with a coffee and a mimosa and called it a morning. Great new spot on the strip I'll definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"I have had the best experience here. Kyler is an amazing bartender and I enjoyed the food he suggested and then he mentioned they had bottomless mimosas so come back, when I came back the next day, I met Heidi and she was wonderful and attentive and made our time here in Vegas amazing.  I would come back to see them any time!"}
{"text":"Sat down to be served.  After 10 minutes, I decided to leave since it appeared the servers were too busy.  There didn't appear to be many being served outside.  I guess they were too tired to serve or perhaps were hoping customers would leave on their own.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"I found this 5 star review in my yelp Draft box. Honestly I don't remember this restaurant (must have been one of those nights in Vegas LOL) but since I gave it 5 Stars when I started my review I should go ahead and give kudos where kudos is due."}
{"text":"We pulled an all-nighter on an impromptu vegas trip. We scored an interesting hotel (see review on SLS) earlier that day, got ready and the spent the night/morning drinking and exploring. Makes sense we were hungry when the sun came up. We stumbled upon Tom's Urban's big ass sign and decided to give it a go. The lady who took care of us that morning was awesome! She made the best mimosas west of the Mississippi. She took time to deal with us drunken fools and did it with a smile. The breakfast was on point, big ol portions of pancakes, bacon, perfectly cooked eggs, and filet mignon (yas, for breakfast). Not sure what's up with the bad reviews. Maybe y'all just mean drunks. JK."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday and it was not busy. The only business was out on the patio and I was disappointed in the service. The food tasted good when it finally made it out. We ordered two salads, of which the ingredients were all cold and it took over 25 min, plus our waitress could never be found. There are plenty of places to eat in this town, and when I come back I will settle for the other fair."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here with no appetite and swearing I'll never drink again. Then I ordered the small mac and cheese, the shrimp po boy sliders and a bourbon bacon bloody mary.  This place is gorgeous and colorful and has a patio right on the strip. I'm glad shake shack was too packed to take us, otherwise, I wouldn't have popped my head in here. Menu is a standard $10-25 but can be more with a steak or drinks or what not. The food was great.  Mac & Cheese- this small plate isn't a small plate and it came piled with pico de gallo and shreaded meat. I've never had this twist on a mac & cheese before and not sure if I loved it. BUT I love the idea of it. On any other given day, I would order this as would anybody else. Who doesn't want a crack mac and cheese?  Shrimp po boy sliders- came with 3 of these babies. Same thing, I loved the concept. The shrimp was battered and fried and I prefer them grilled but It was still good.   The bourbon bloody mary- Was ok. 3 stars. It was more ice than blood mary and it was poorly garnished. And normally a bacon bloody mary comes with a strip of crispy bacon but this one didn't.   Anyhow, our waiter was super friendly, attentive, and asked if we needed a split check at the BEGINNING instead of the mess at the end. Greatly appreciated it."}
{"text":"My friend and I got the eggs Benedict and they didn't toast the English muffin, it was just raw bread... very odd. The chilaquiles were delicious but had way too many toppings to chip ratio.  The waitress was very inattentive to us as well and service was not great"}
{"text":"The service is horrible. We had to wait 30 minutes just for drink and almost an hour for food. When I went to tell the manager he basically shrugged us off. The food is good but not worth the time. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Good food, great location! The pop tarts were awesome, and there's a nice selection for brunch. Staff was super nice as well! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Wow. The food is so good here but the service is really bad. We went in for lunch and they were somewhat busy. I would say 3/4th of the restaurant was full so not a large rush or anything.  I ordered a caesar salad and a \"french dip sandwich.\" The server was confused because what I meant was the \"PRIME RIB PHILLY CHEESESTEAK DIP\" so she asked me to clarify if i wanted the dip with the salad and I said \"I want the sandwich as one order and the salad as a separate order. 45 minutes later she brings everyone their food and I get my salad and a side of au jus.... no sandwich. I asked the waitress where the sandwich was and she said \"oh I thought you just wanted the dip part\" ... why would i just want the dip part? I asked her to bring some extra dressing and the sandwich itself. Another 30 min later she finally brings out the sandwich after all my friends had finished eating and no extra dressing. Food here is really good, i recommend getting it to-go."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back. Came here to have a late breakfast the other day and left quite satisfied.   I had been eyeing their poppyseed blueberry pancakes for awhile now and am glad I ordered it. They are definitely made to order and they are plenty for two.   Because I can't just do sweets for breakfast, i needed something hearty as well. So we ordered the steak nachos also. Which were really good. The boy ordered steaks and eggs and the steak was amazing. No need for A1 sauce, kudos to you chef!   4stars only because I really needed a coffee and their espresso machine was broken"}
{"text":"Eddie the Server provided outstanding customer service! Provided insight on the menu and recommended food options that we (7 of us) enjoyed! For the LGBT community, ask for Eddie! Took care of us 7 queens!! Ask for the Jalapeño Popper burger for a kicking dinner before a stroll to the Fruit Loop!!!"}
{"text":"Toms urban is a great location if you are on the strip or specifically attending an even at T-Mobile arena! Really cool inside/outside bar physically on the strip walk-way which is a cool atmosphere! We sat at the bar for a few apps and were greeted promptly and offered drinks! We ordered the limoncello glazed wings which were phenomenal. I've never have wings with that particular dressing but man they were amazing to say the least. Also got the seafood Mac and cheese which was a very generous portion and tasted delicious not too much cheese where it over powered the seafood which was perfect for my linking. Obviously being on the strip the prices tend to be a little steep (which is expected) being a local, it kinda stings to pay those prices but it is what it is. If you're in the area for an event I would highly recommend checking out Tom's!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped by to get our night started, and it turned out to be even better experience than expected. Even though we only had drinks, service was great! Shout out to Sam Fusciardi for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"Well okay, more like 3 and a half stars! As a local, I tend to steer clear of anything that involves driving on the Strip, let alone on a weekend. However, after a long week, a friend and I wanted to get breakfast and mimosa-wasted-on-a-budget, so we decided to try this place out.  Tom's Urban is surprisingly large and Pinterest-looking. With its aqua and persimmon-colored orb lighting dotting the ceiling coupled with its wooden rustic paneling, it looks straight out of something from Austin, TX...I dig it.   For $18, you get bottomless mimosas, provided you get there somewhat early (the cut-off time for this deal is 1pm) I had the Classic Eggs Benedict ($13) and my friend got the Lemon Poppyseed Blueberry pancakes ($10). We split our entrees and had a good combo of savory and sweet. I have to say the pancakes were amazing! My eggs benedict looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for longer than expected (see picture), but it was still good.  Our waitress was friendly. It took awhile for the first set of mimosas to come out, but after that, they seem to keep coming. By the time we paid the check, we were both nursing bad champagne headaches. Actually, the menu states they use sparkling wine, so I'm not sure if that contributed to the intensity. Nonetheless, we got what we came for! Overall, breakfast prices are decent, but I agree with other reviewers that their other foods run a little high."}
{"text":"Being a simple man from southern New Jersey, I had never been to the Big Apple. Much to my delight I found Tom's Urban connected to the New York New York Casino. After 37 mimosas and some scrumptious to taster strudels, my belly had fallen in love with our gorgeous waitress Maggie. I long for her. She is the ying to my yang. The macaroni to my cheese. I highly recommend the tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"Was a solid little joint right off of the strip by New York New York, me and my girlfriend stumbled in before watching zumanity.   The menu was great, a lot of diversity. Some of my favorite words like \"aioli\", \"brunch\" and \"tacos\". We ended up ordering the lobster shrimp tacos which were great because you cannot go wrong. Would have loved some crazy sauce on there but I'm not complaining. We also ordered the fried pickles: great sauce and fresh tasting pickles (also ended up getting for free because of great yelp check in offers!) and the dumplings: very tasty but kind of crunchy on the edges, not exactly what I expect in dumplings. Over all good food, but minor rooms for improvement.   Accompanied my dinner with a kiwi margarita and an atomic duck IPA, always my go to duo.   Service was fast, attentive and consistent. Not a necessarily personable waiter, but that's nit picky. He took care of everything quite professionally.  The place is pretty cool, overall nice atmosphere supported by great food choices. Was not necessarily wowed by anything in particular but the place got the job done well and left no room for complaint."}
{"text":"Catching some late night grub, this place has an ideal location right next to New York, New York. The waitress was super sweet and explained the concept of the restaurant were items that are typically found on food trucks.  The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, and with the location and breeze outside we picked outside. There did seem to be some music compeition between Tom's Urban and the shake shack next door.  Thanks to Yelp, we got our choice of free fried pickles or brussel sprouts with our meal with a Yelp Check in. With a ten year old with us, fried pickles it was! They tasted pretty good for being free, but there were other starters that I would have picked over the pickles. They do not offer a Kid's Menu but the waitress automatically listed some suggestions of items on the menu as well as a grilled cheese which isn't listed. This seems to be an issue with other reviewers, but with our waitress it wasn't a problem. I order the Honey BBQ Chicken sliders, which comes with three sliders. I could only finish half of the plate, and my boyfriend and cousin took the rest.  My cousin ordered the honey bbq chicken wings which are his favorite food in the world so he gives this place ten stars. My boyfriend ordered the Tacos Al Carbon Street tacos. These are not your typical Tex-mex al carbon from Texas but he said they were interesting and then ate one of my sliders.  I really liked this place and our experience here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here in a panic as we were running out of time and walking the strip in search of a quick lunch. Looked like a decent option, with bright, hip decor, loud music and a big menu.  Unfortunately, the mediocre service and high prices made for a real letdown. We waited a while for a server to show up, and after she did, a second different server showed up and took over. I ordered the \"limoncello\" chicken wings and was pretty shocked to get 5 skimpy wings for the $14 price tag. Two thumbs up for the side of street corn that I ordered extra. It was the only redeeming part of the meal.  Though, they screwed up the order and brought me tater tots instead.  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich that came with avocado, but it was missing from the sandwich (I'm starting to think this isn't a coincidence, as this is the third time recently that the kitchen overlooks this). No biggie, except that it took a while to get it brought out.  The table next to us was having similar issues, with slow service, cold fries, and other randomness.  Maybe this place is a better option during their afternoon or late night happy hours.  At 2pm on a Saturday, it's a real drag.  No thanks."}
{"text":"My server Eddie was a great server! Awesome service and the atmosphere is great for a casual date night."}
{"text":"No wait, quick service, and our serve Eddie was the best!! We stopped here after a concert at the T-Mobile and thought it would be packed with a long wait. Surprisingly they immediately sat us on the patio. We shared fried pickles, sliders, and a side of fries. We weren't starving but needed something, and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Our waitress Kellie was absolutely amazing! The food was SO GOOD!! Get the breakfast platter with sausage- perfect cure for your Vegas size hangover."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing happy hour!! We got to sit outside and enjoy the view of the Las Vegas strip. We got the Brussels sprouts on happy hour and they were delicious. They were also really accommodating when our entree was a little to spicy and remade it for us without any question. Our server Eric was awesome, helpful and kind! Definitely a great place to checkout while on the strip."}
{"text":"The food is ahhhhmazing! If you want a great meal that doesn't break the bank, Tom's Urban is your place. Such a creative, out of the box menu. The staff is just as great. Mike made is feel right at home, like we'd known each other for years. He's very knowledgeable about the menu. Definitely add this restaurant to your plans in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience for lunch or dinner. Casual dining. I gave this place 3 stars for several reasons. My menu was not clean. Pages were sticking together as if a sugary drink spilled all over it. The waitress was too quick for me to ask for another menu so I used my husband's. We were seating against a wall in the corner. Which was fine since we don't really mind. My orange juice came in a small glass with two stir straws as if it had alcohol in it. The stir straws,evidently, was also sticky. Interestingly, the chocolate milk was given in a tall glass. My husband got the urban pop tarts. Apple filling. I got the lemon poppy seed blueberry pancakes. It took 25 minutes for us to get our food. My husband's pastry pop tart was about the size of a piece of bread. He took one bite and it was cold. He had to flag the waitress's attention to inform her his food was cold. She took it back and he had to wait a bit longer. We started to eat my pancakes together which was very good. I was pleased with it. Three large pancakes with butter and side of maple syrup. I'm a big fan of lemon poppy seeds so I was happy we enjoyed something there. Shortly later, my husband got his pastry and it was definitely warm this time! I got to try it and it was delicious. It will not be filling if you are very hungry though.  They have large round seating which I thought would be great for groups and booths. They do have portable TV stands placed around the restaurant which I like but also made maneuvering around the restaurant a little tricky."}
{"text":"Unbelievable mimosas! Paulina was a delight! Took great care of us and made sure our food was just what we asked for. I wish she could be cloned and sent to our Tom's in Denver."}
{"text":"I love me some Tom's Urban. We were here for a invitation only slot tournament and the brunch was at Tom's Urban. I've been in the restaurant on other occasions as well. The space is bright and airy. It includes bar seating, restaurant style seating, and al fresco, with some pretty cool misters for the Vegas heat. One thing I like about Tom's Urban is that the serving staff are considerate and don't mind speaking up about what their favorite dishes are in the restaurant. I've had brunch and dinner here, and both times my food was yummy. I like that Tom's takes a different/eclectic/fun approach to food. They aren't intimidated by new flavor combinations, which is so refreshing. I believe Tom's has more beers on tap than I have ever seen in my entire life in one place. Additionally, they have a well-stocked well. Seriously, look up and all around at the many variations of alcohol they have. They even have a pretty amazing happy hour. I can't say enough good things about Tom's Urban. A side note: take a selfie with the big martini glass on the other side of the casino, post it to social media, and get a discount. It's a win-win unless you're embarrassing yourself in the selfie (remember social media selfies don't stay in Vegas). Seriously, though, try Tom's Urban if you're interested in something off the beaten path with good flavor, good service, and good ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  The environment is very funky with music videos playing on all of the screens. The good was superb. I had the green chili mac and cheese and the filet mignon sliders. Both were so delicious and cooked perfectly.  Service was good and this is one of our new favorites"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for brunch and to specifically try the bourbon Bloody Mary. When we ordered it from the bartender he said they didn't have it and said it wasn't that great anyway. He seemed not to care we were excited about trying the drink he was not in a good mood. We then were seated to eat and when we asked the waiter about some brunch items he said he didn't eat meat and wouldn't eat any of this crap. I think you all need new staff who are more enthusiastic about serving your drinks and food selection. Left feeling very unsatisfied with the entire experience."}
{"text":"Disappointing all around. 16 oz watered down drinks for $15, super dry mahi tacos....asked for a side of sour cream so I could eat them. Waitress was friendly though. There's just lots of better options in the NY NY....don't waste a meal on this place!"}
{"text":"Spent $80 for breakfast for three people.  Not worth it for mediocre food.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"This place is obsessed with palette wood. I just had to get that out of the way, because there's healthy hobby, and then there is completely obsessed with covering every available inch. It looks good, but man. Maybe see a psyche about this? (I'm just saying had they served our lunch on palette boards, I would have understood.)  We had a great lunch here outdoors right on the strip. This is gastro food so don't expect much, but I would say for the dollars spent and the diversity of the menu, this is an above average strip restaurant. I definitely recommend if you're in the vicinity of New York New York and you don't want to eat indoors."}
{"text":"While staying at the New York New York, we decided to try out this place for breakfast. At first I was confused because we didn't know which side was the entrance. The hostess was super nice and friendly. I was kind of upset that they sat us in the area where they keep the sliding door open...which made it more cold. The waitress was kind of sassy...didn't really care for her. She barely checked on us and she didn't even tell us where we was suppose to pay. We could of just walked out and they wouldn't even know. The food was OK. Nothing really special about it."}
{"text":"Stopped here twice with family & friends.  We ate inside on our first visit with a party of 9 and outside on the patio with my mom.    Both visits the wait staff were friendly and helpful with making suggestions for this very particular guest!    Everyone enjoyed their food from the basic burger sliders to the Ruben, pasta dishes and salads.  My chicken pops were seasoned very well, but were DRY - ;-(.  My 2nd meal I pieced together and it was yummy!!  This is a great place for food or just drinks.  You can people watch from the bar or patio as its in an ideal location.  I highly recommend stopping through, especially with guest, as a all around easy spot to get a good in take of the strip!!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for dinner with my cousin before the VGK game. I don't know if I came on a bad day but I ordered 2 cocktails & barely tasted any alcohol in either one. I brought this up to my server too. The shrimp po' boy sliders were good & the tater tots were nice & crispy. I may or may not return"}
{"text":"Really liked this place, it would be five stars, but they are extremely short staffed due to management mishandling.  Food, drinks, atmosphere= awesome  Servers were Michael, Steven and Wes....definitely ask for one of them!"}
{"text":"Can't argue with a good happy hour! But the happy hour is based on the time of the day! 2 happy hour Mai Tai's & French Fries Both Ways all for $14 dollars. The food was $4.00the drinks were $5.00 at 4pm, 5pm up $1."}
{"text":"Tried a bunch of items on the menu.  Everything we ate was excellent.  We had amazing service from a bartender named Jeff.  He was polite, knowledgeable and there when we needed him.  He is an asset to Toms Urban"}
{"text":"I came to Tom's Urban after seeing Zarkana at Aria. I wasn't really hungry for a big dinner meal but I wanted a little something that wasn't fast food or from the food court. NYNY is one of my favorite hotel/casinos on the strip; I love that you don't get that fancy and pretentious feel you get in a lot of hotels and casinos, although I know this is what many people prefer-  but not me! I decided to sit at the smaller bar that is almost a part of the casino. The actual restaurant is bigger than I thought it was and it looks like they have a nice seating area out on their patio which is right on the strip. I ordered the pork belly tacos as I read on yelp that they were a good choice. They were excellent, some of the best tacos I've ever had. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas to get a second round of these yummy tacos and try some of the other dishes on their menu. The bartender told me this place had only been open for 2 weeks, and in my opinion they're doing a great job! Bartender was friendly and asked me about my trip without being annoying or overbearing. I didn't get a drink but my water was kept full the entire time, great and friendly service. This was my best dining experience during my trip to Vegas- would recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to place food order. 28 minutes to get the food. Restaurant only about 25% full. Waiters standing around everywhere, ours was nowhere to be found, never came back to check on us, had to flag him down to get drink refills. Which is unfortunate for him since I usually tip very well. To top it all off, all 4 of us had to run for the bathroom shortly after eating. Worst food experience I've ever had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The first morning (12/25) in Vegas we ate here and I had the eggs Benedict. They where very good! So on 12/31 we decided to eat a late lunch here. My gf ordered a cheese burger and I ordered the lobster roll. The waitress leave a to turn in our order but returns shortly after to inform us they are out of the large hamburger patties. Seems kinda like a rookie mistake for a restaurant, either that or they where hoarding them for that night. Overall tho not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"The steak nachos were the best we've had in Vegas so far! And the filet mignon sliders were absolutely Delicious!! The seating and atmosphere is airy and relaxed. Outdoor seating was great for people watching. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"My love and I came for a late breakfast today. We were seated right away and had a very sweet server. I had the original eggs Benedict ($13) and my partner had the big fluffy pancakes ($9 and some change), which came with salted caramel butter (so good!) and syrup. He added some bacon on for an up charge, and he could not stop telling me how tasty the bacon was. Be aware, the portion is huge...you get three very large pancakes! Unfortunately, he was unable to finish his meal but it was so delicious. I loved my eggs Benedict and liked the touch with the green onions garnished on there. My meal came with hash browns, which were also tasty. Additionally, I thought the prices for breakfast here were incredibly fair considering the location. We would like to try this place for lunch or dinner in the future!"}
{"text":"Uh-mazing. 1) Great hostesses. 2) A taster of 4 mixed drinks. 3) A resident magician who literally blew my mind. 4) GREAT waitress. 5) Manager (Ortal) not only checked on us, but made sure we stayed happy, and was so personable!!! Food tasted great, drinks tasted great.  I had the pork belly tacos, my sister had the avocado bacon burger with sweet potato fries. My. God. Melt in your mouth good.   Sit outside on the strip and enjoy your life!"}
{"text":"Toms is located in NYNY which we are staying at. It looks great from outside. Greeted by a friendly lady to take us to our table was a great start... This is where it began to go downhill...we waited 25 minutes to get our drinks. The servers seemed to be very confused where they were up to - 3 tables next to us all received incorrect orders. Also our waitress didn't even remember that she had taken our order which was strange. The food (steamed chicken parcels and chicken taco) were decent but definitely had better. Only decent thing was $5 beer on happy hour.   When the waitress came for the bill we had left a 3 tip on a $20 tab which I believe to be fair for the service we received but the waitress thought otherwise and wouldn't take it. It appeared that she wanted more which definitely shouldn't be the case."}
{"text":"I went to the Tom's Urban in Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, CT, opening weekend. And I was extremely pleased with everyrhing! The atmosphere was beautifully done! I was greeted at the door by Jocelyn the host who was very sweet and friendly. Our server Ryan was so knowledgeable on the entire menu which was impressive because it was opening weekend. All in all I had a great time and the staff was phenomenal!!  Looks like another great restaurant addition to Mohegan Sun! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so yummy! It was my first experience with fried pickles and now I am such a fan! The Boulder Club was very filling and delicious. I love sweet potato fries and these did not disappoint. They were criss cross cut, golden and extra crispy, just the way I like them!"}
{"text":"Pros:  My food was delicious!!! Well worth the money, quick service, the waitress was really sweet and the level of customer service is a definite plus.  I really liked the atmosphere, it was relaxing and entertaining (the scenery).    Cons:  Honestly, I only have one.  The size of my Mimosa was a true disappointment for the price of $14.50!  It had to be a little more than a half a cup BUT it tasted fresh and I enjoyed it.  I would've ordered any one but I refused to pay almost $30 for two drinks.  The bottomless Mimosa's are made with a cheaper wine so I passed on that.  Overall, It was worth it and I will gladly return!"}
{"text":"My beautiful server Rosa brought me the best chillaquilles ever. Perfect hangover food My mimosa was A1 too  coming back"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and came here twice for lunch because it was that good! Our server, Nate, was like an old soul and treated us like friends... not like a sale. Gave honest and useful recommendations. The Brussel sprouts were off the charts tasty! Our crew, over the two visits, had the Mahi street tacos, avocado and chicken salad, bacon burger, grilled chicken salad, and the fish special... we cleaned the plates. The spices, sauces, and flavors worked together to make even a burger explode with flavor! Prices were reasonable too. I highly recommend the Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"Dave was amazing! Drinks stayed full. We laughed, we cried,  we stumbled away very happy. Mmhmm ! Food and drinks 100% on point"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only has 3.8 stars it's wonderful. The staff is all smiles and the food was really good. I tried the Mac and cheese with pork on top, I wasn't sure at first but the waitress said it was good and it was. Thanks guys and gals for a great simple lunch."}
{"text":"I have dined at Toms Urban a couple times this week and must say it is awesome! The menu is very eclectic. You must try the edamame or the duck wings as an appetizer. Highly recommend the truffle burger or the chopped salad. Servers are very energetic and knowledgeable.   Toms Urban is a MUST visit!"}
{"text":"Our server was very nice and attentive.  Out of our party of 6, no one had a meal they didn't like.  Large portions.  Our only complaints were the drinks were not very strong and they do not offer soup on their menu.  We were a little disappointed our nacho appetizer took longer than usual and our entrees were quicker than usual.  There was 5 minutes in between so most of our cold nachos went uneaten."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Toms Urban and it was great. We had a salad and fish tacos and they were delicious. We sat outside by the street. The staff were very friendly. I can really recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best food ever! Wish I lived closer so I can eat here more often! This is my favorite restaurant ever !"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and location open patio overlooking the Las Vegas strip near New York New York.  Kitchen open late like 1A.M. On a Wednesday night.  Cool alternative/pop music bumping, misters, lots of beer on tap, menus has a good selection like breakfast all day, appetizers, pot stickers, tacos.  I had the sin city burger with garlic fries and it tasted wonderful!  Staff is friendly and have personality.  Good out of kitchen took a little long, but I had an overall happy experience.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Sat in their outdoor patio enjoyed pot stickers, fries, and great selection of beer. Good fun place."}
{"text":"Phew. That was a rough night. Time for some hangover food!   Shrimp sliders and mac and cheese. Awesome. The bread on my sliders was toasted well, and the sauce on the crispy shrimp was great! Their bloody mary selection is good too. I had the Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary... I mean c'mon, that's not even fair anymore. My hangover was pretty much gone after I finished everything!"}
{"text":"Tom's has a very broad (and brand new!) menu to offer which was awesome for a group of five. We all ordered something different and shared - the portions are a really good size. Our favorites were: Huevos Benedictos, BBQ chicken sliders, Lemon Blueberry poppyseed pancakes and the Tree Hugger Benedict. Everything was awesome - and those pancakes were the kicker! If you love lemon you will love these. Service was really good - everyone was nice and accommodating and the manager actually visited our table a couple of times. They even gave us some bottomless mimosas to go! I am definitely coming back here before I leave Vegas!!!  Came back a few days later and has Tina helping us this time. She was so awesome!! This time we ordered the breakfast BLT, Urban breakfast and an omelet with poblano peppers which was amazing. This place is honestly the real deal...I will be coming here every time I am in Vegas from now on!! Happy eating :)"}
{"text":"Michael, Timothy, and Miranda are EXCELLENT servers!  This place is awesome and everything is super DELISH!  The filet mignon sliders are a must have"}
{"text":"Favorite place in Vegas. Food is amazing and staff was awesome. Went 3 days in a row. Jose was an awesome waiter that truly took care of us. Steak nachos are delicious. Tom Collins cocktail was awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Good Cuban sandwich, yummy shrimp lobster tacos and a tasty peach martini made for a very satisfactory lunch at Tom's Urban in the New York New York casino.  Thank you, Eli, for your good service!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here before the Zumanity show and was extremely disappointed. We came in for happy hour with the expectation of getting a decent drink and it was not the case. The margarita was extremely sour and distasteful. I ordered another drink that include a strawberry mix and it was not good at all. The waitress had the margarita remade, however it was still horrible. Unfortunately I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic .Nachos were just great and the eggs Benedict for breakfast was excellent. A person I was with could not stop eating their French fries. If you coming from the hotel side you don't realize how big the place is so there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Stopped here needing a good hearty breakfast after a late night and got an omelet. The portions were huge but the fillings were a little light. Hash Browns were covered in cheese and a little on the crispy side which were not my favorite. Service was pretty rough - coffee only refilled once and I had to flag down a waitress for my check. It wasn't busy at all the staff was just not that attentive.   Still not a bad place, but a little overpriced and eh service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now...the first visit was not so much and the second was much better. I'm a fan of this place particularly because of the ambience/location.  It's right on the strip, you can hear the music being played by the Brooklyn Bridge DJ and the people watching is phenomenal.  My recommendations:   1.  Sit in the bar area and enjoy the water misters on a warm, summer night. 2.  Have breakfast for dinner!  My omelette was yummy! 3.  Have a frozen moscow mule (or any happy hour cocktail) and get on with the people watching.   Thank you for a fun second visit, Tom!!"}
{"text":"Dani is THE BEST bartender you could ever encounter!! The food is great, the drinks are delicious!! And the Happy hours! YES, happy hoursssss, are amazing. Dani makes the Las Vegas experiences more lustfull hahaha, with his awesome sense of humor and his personable personality! Come to Tom's Urban!!! You won't regret it! I Swear!!!"}
{"text":"I was hopeful, but ultimately not impressed. The place was not busy. There were a bunch of TVs scattered about playing 80s music videos. The novelty items that were featured as favorites or their specialties were lackluster. If I was walking by and needed a bite to eat, I'd sit on their patio for the great view. Otherwise, you might want to keep walking and just go to the Shake Shack next door."}
{"text":"This morning I dine with my dearest Sprinkle, alongside Papa and Gerty Sausage. A wise man once said, \"let's eat brunch.\" I agree!  We started with a round of coffees. Normal!  Sprinkle gets the first food - the Birthday Poptart. \"It's brown inside,\" she exclaims! \"It tastes like brown.\" I couldn't agree more, Sprinkle. In fact, the not-so-flaky pastry was filled with brownie. If I'm being frank, she seemed a bit let down, dear readers. I'm not sure if she'll rebound after this one. There weren't even sprinkles on it. The photo had promised her sprinkles...  Papa has gotten the Three Little Pigs omelette. \"The hash browns are weird. They are really thin and mostly cheese.\" \"Not bad...\" He mutters between bites.  \"This is one of my favorite times being stuffed by 3 kinds of meat.\" Care to elaborate, Papa? Perhaps it's best that this secret doesn't leave the bedroom...  Gerty ordered the Boulder Club. \"It's very tall.\" Allow me to explain; this sandwich has three slices of bread. Imagine a Big Mac, but in sandwich form (all you trolls out there that want to argue a burger is in the sandwich family, take it offline!) \"It's not anything real special,\" she says. Sorry, Gerty!  Sprinkle has received the Hangover Slopper. Whoa whoa whoa! The meaty burger is soaked in egg juice and salsa. I try to determine what is more moist: Sprinkle's watering mouth, or the meaty burger. I will say that it is a tie. \"Shmeh,\" she ultimately determines. \"Soggy, shmeh, and undercooked.\"  Two little birdies pop into the restaurant. This is a sign! Perhaps we have two new best friends. This day is complete.  I have ordered the Huevos Benedicto. I must say, this entree is quite delicious! It is a nice balance of spice and sweet. The pork is of great quality and the green chili hollondaise sauce is indeed unique! Tom of Tom's Urban, I am proud to be your tuba tooter. I will climb to the tallest building and sing the praises of your Huevos Benedicto, but I will be so high up that I'm afraid no one will hear me. Do you ever feel alone, Tom? Do long silences make you uncomfortable? Tom?  The Sausage family has had another successful outing, all thanks to Tom. He is welcome in our home anytime. We will prepare plenty of activities throughout the house - in the kitchen, yard, bedroom, etc. Thank you, Tim's Orphan!"}
{"text":"My family and I had breakfast here solely for the reason of bottomless mimosas. My sister and I shared pancakes and the Urban platter that came with eggs, sausage, and hash browns. My cousins ordered an eggs Benedict and an Urban platter as well. The pancakes were very good, fluffy and sweet. The rest of the food was just okay. Their sourdough toast was as hard as a brick and there was no butter at all on it. When asked for butter, they gave us two small packets of butter to share for our four pieces of toast. The hash browns were bland and so we added salt and pepper to make it taste like something. My cousin also said her eggs Benedict sauce was bland and it wasn't what she was expecting.  Although I did not get the bottomless mimosas myself, that was probably the saving grace of this place. All three of my family had 3 mimosas each, in which had a decent amount of alcohol to pay off for the price of them.  Overall, I recommend this place for the bottomless mimosas. The food? Not so much. The service? Decent!"}
{"text":"We are here in a Monday at 5:00pm.  The place is almost completely empty.  And yet the service is horrendous.  The table has old food stuck in between the slats.  I have to continuously call the waiter over - first to fill an empty water glass and then to ask for ketchup after he delivered a sandwich with French fries.         Our waiter (Tim) was about as bad as a waiter could be.  Inattentive, grab-assing with the other wait staff while we were trying to flag him down, and reaching across the table in front of me to reach my wife's glass (instead of walking around to her side of the table.  Really bad in so many levels.       The food was extremely mediocre - pulled pork sandwich was skimpy - roll was soggy, and the sauce was weak.  Sweet potato fries were over salted.  The Margherita pizza consisted of undercooked dough, what tasted like Ragu pizza sauce, and a melted string cheese stick.  Top this off with our waiter, Tim, serving it with his thumb firmly planted in a slice, mmmm delicious.  Not.      The music was loud and competed with different music coming from outdoor speakers beyond the patio and a street electric guitarist.  The drinks were expensive but I am giving the place 1 star because of its perfect patio location - great for people watching.  So, other than the food, the wait staff, and the pricey drinks - this place rocks."}
{"text":"This resturant is one of a kind. I'm still shocked about my experience here, and hopefully my input might possibly save you from leaving completely disappointed.   The decor and the concept of the restaurant is beautiful and fabulous. HDTVs everywhere, it's simple which would lead you to believe that they serve great food here. The service here is fast and friendly. To be honest with you, my server accidentally made a mistake on my order and I wasn't even mad at that. Everyone makes mistakes. The server was friendly, and provided excellence service. Even the manager was also around asking for feedback and checking on customers. When you have those components at a eatery it usually leads to great things.   However, I would avoid this place because the food is M E D I O C R E! What puts the cherry open top is the prices. I ordered a Carnitas Cubano, the presentation looked like a normal grilled cheese sandwich but the only thing I tasted in the sandwich was mustard. And they charged 15 dollars for a sandwich that tasted like mustard? It came with a kale salad which didn't have anything appealing to it. It also didn't have any dressing. The menu is overpriced and not worth the value. 18 dollars for nachos? The place just leads you on for a epic let down. Just to put this into perspective, Earl of Sandwich cost 7 dollars for a sandwich and its taste great. They're too many places on the strip that charge half of what Tom Urban charges for more appetizing food.   So honestly, I don't think good service nor the manager can change my mind about this place until the food actually is appetizing. I don't understand how this place is holding down a 4 star rating? This the only meal I've ever regret having in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Worst service in Vegas I have ever received. No direction, over priced drinks, and only one of the 5 bars had people working, and even at that one that was open, they had no idea what was going on. We got seated after the 50 other people that came in AFTER we were put on the list. We left shortly after finally reminding them that we needed seated. Worst place ever please save your time and head further down the strip."}
{"text":"Service just wasn't that good. I like the convenience, however, I also like ranch. I'm from California... Judge me, idc. Just do me, riight, pls. Thx."}
{"text":"A good place to have appetizers since that open until 3AM on the weekends. They have many seating a including outdoor patio. The selections of food and beer with happy hour is great. Only our server was okay, didn't talk much, but did get the job done."}
{"text":"We have been to TU twice during our stay in Vegas. Food is Amazing. The unlimited mimosas are a bargain on the strip. I hope you get Nate as your server. He's on top of it. The best service we've experienced here. #NateRules"}
{"text":"We went 2x in Vegas. Their Philly style sandwich with shredded prime rib might be the best sandwich Ive had in my whole life. Yea, I said it. It was insane. Had some dry fries which is unfortunate. Service was good. Also had an awesome bloody mary so give that a go."}
{"text":"We spent many hours here watching basketball, drinking beer and having a snack or two during March madness.  We had great service both days, the prices are very reasonable and the food we had was good."}
{"text":"Service began a bit slow. We sat at the bar and it took a while to get acknowledged. Right when I was about to get seriously annoyed, we were asked to order. Drinks are pricey. We opted for bottomless mimosas as it's a better bang for our buck. Even if we only drank two, we'd be saving money. We had early dinner plans so we shared a Cuban sandwich with a side of lemon rosemary tots and cheesy hashbrowns. The food was really good. The pork in the Cuban was tender and moist. The cheesy hashbrowns were delish. The tots were meh. The mimosas kept flowing and were quite strong. After about 4 I was a bit tipsy. If I'm in the area again I would return. Hopefully it won't take twenty minutes to place an order."}
{"text":"The team at Tom's is serious about making things right. With that being said, I will be giving them another try shortly."}
{"text":"After we were seated by the hostess, we spent 10 minutes waiting for someone to even address us with about 7 waiters and waitresses passing us by. Finally, my friend went to the bar to go get us some waters. I then got up and approached one of the waitresses and asked her if she could help us locate our waiter. Her response was \"go talk to the hostess\". Annoyed, I then asked her if she could send a manager over. She turned around and continued serving her tables. Finally the hostess came over and I asked again to speak to the manager. The manager finally came over to our table and asked \"can I help you?\". I started explaining the situation and he cut me off before I could get one sentence out and asked what we were ordering. He was uninterested in our concern, did not apologize, and made some lame excuse like the hostess shouldn't have brought us there. Our food came out quickly, but they forgot a side salad that we ordered and the food was questionably not warm. The manager never followed up at the end and clearly did not care about our concerns in the slightest. The horrible service and mediocre food is not worth stepping foot in this place."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Some of the avocado pieces in my salad were brown. Server never brought over napkins even after we asked for them. Asian items on the menu but place didn't have soy sauce. Soggy veggies with the wings. Slightly overpriced for what they were offering.  LIKE  Hostess accommodated our need to sit by an outlet to plug our laptops in. The edamame. The venue design.  The variety of menu items.  LOVE  Nothing."}
{"text":"We visited Tom's Urban earlier today for a Bloody Mary. We asked for them to be extra spicy and they were tasty! We returned for dinner with a party of 19.  We had a reservation and they accommodated us placing tables together for us in the restaurant area. They got a lot of orders wrong and it was a bit of a mess. All in all everyone enjoyed their food. Main takeaway, probably not the best local for a large party. It is a good spot for a Bloody (at inflated Vegas prices) or a bite for a smaller group."}
{"text":"Pretty good and decent price, especially in Vegas! The hashbrowns are covered in cheese and it was pretty good. Toast was a little hard.... Omelette was good. Good place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"The service was slow- perhaps our waitress was overwhelmed...my soup was cold when  I got it and had to send it back(which I never do) . My husband's burrito was small and the tortilla was hard-like it sat under a heat lamp for too long! The coffee was slow coming too- wish I had a better experience to write about because when I got my soup back the second time it was delicious! Probably the server we had was having an off day...because many people got there food around us much quicker! Oh well -not going back..."}
{"text":"The service was awful.  Waited over 30 minutes for our food. Was never checked back on. Order was incorrect and food was lukewarm. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service! Visited on their second day open and even with minor hiccups, they were very accommodating. Definitely try the garlic fries. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick lunch with my girlfriend and wasn't expecting such an awesome time. The hostess Michelle was very nice and our bartender Jared made us laugh the entire time. I had a local brew (Dirty Dog IPA) and it was one of the best beers I've ever had! The manager Tim came over to check on us and we ended up talking about the upcoming NFL season. Go Cowboys! And definitely try the Sin City Burger with a chicken patty. Delicious! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I order the classic benedict.Comes with the melted cheese on hashbrowns. The ham on the muffin was sweet and tender. Eggs poached so nicely. Highly recommend for your starter of the day. Our server Kyle was very charsimatic, he'll tell you all the good stuff. He was considerate about us. We sat in a sunny spot out outside and Kyle helped us move to a more comfortble, shady spot. He'll take real good care of you."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We ordered the barbecue sliders, fried pickles and avocado bacon burger with garlic fries. Best food I've eaten in a while. The fries were so delicious!! The burger was amazing!! And the sliders... Yum! Only thing I can complain about is the service. Our food took at least an hour to come out, but I would give this place 5 stars anyways because of the food quality and taste. I think they may have just had an off day or had someone call in...? This place is a bit expensive, but a MUST TRY if you are walking around the Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"I came here to have a drink and food, had my drink and was unsure of what I wanted and was going to leave.  But Katie the bartender suggested a couple different appetizers for me, and I went with her suggestions.   Long story short.   I stayed for more drinks and her suggestion of  appetizers.  Thank  you Katie.  I had a great experience"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a weekday.  We got the burrito and bacon avocado omelette with a Bloody Mary. For Vegas the prices were good. Good was good quality. Service was great and you can be outside. Highly recommend! We will be back for happy hour which has 4$ bites and drinks."}
{"text":"Breakfast is fantastic. I had the bacon avocado cheddar omelette with polenta grits and sourdough toast, which came with delicious raspberry jelly. The grits were out of this world. Omelette was cooked perfectly. $19 bottomless mimosas - but the mimosas are HUGE and they offer you a to-go mimosa so I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Das Tom's Urban wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt in Vegas schon zu unserem \"Stammlokal\", da es sich genau am New York New York Hotel befand, wo wir wohnten nur einen Katzensprung entfernt.  Bei Tom's kann man sowohl drinnen und klimatisiert sitzen, als auch sehr nett draussen. Gerade Abends, wenn die Sonne untergegangen ist, ist das ein super Ort, um den Abend ausklingen zulassen, die vorbeilaufenden Menschen zu beobachten und die Happy Hour mitzunehmen.  Diese gibt es zwei mal am Tag. Von 16-19 und und von 23-02 Uhr. In der ersten Phase, steigt der Preis bis 19 Uhr jeweils um einen Dollar und in der nächtlichen Phase, fällt der Preis, umso später es wird. Witzige Idee.  Die Preise sind ingesamt für Vegas aber sehr moderat und angenehmen. Die Speisenauswahl ist groß und bietet amerikanische Küche, aber auch internationale Gerichte. Das Bier-Menü ist auch hier riesig und bietet eine große Auswahl an Bieren vom Fass.  Die erste Empfehlung beim Essen sind definitiv die Lobster & Shrimp Mac'n'Cheese. Diese war der Hammer und mit dem Lobster-Fleisch und Shrimps toll. Die Portion war wirklich groß und für 19 Dollar vollkommen angemessen. Auch der Hangover Slopper war klasse. Ein Angus Beef Burger mit allem was so auf einen Burger gehört, dazu noch eine Cheese-Sauce und zwei Eiern. Auch eine Bombe, aber super lecker und mal etwas ganz Anderes, als andere Burger. Hatte ich in der Form noch nicht. Siehe meine Fotos. Ansonsten sind die Mini-Slider auch gut, drei kleine Burger für den Hunger zwischendurch.  Besonders zu empfehlen ist im Tom's auch noch der Baby Kale (Grünkohl) Salat, als Caesar Variante mit Chicken. Grünkohl als Salat ist wunderbar und hoffe, das es sich auch mehr in Deutschland durchsetzt. Super lecker, sehr gesund und geschmacklich auch mal ganz anders, als unsere Salatvarianten.  Das Tom's Urban ist also immer ein guter Anlaufpunkt für einen Drink oder ein Essen.  Der Service war übrigens durchweg sehr freundlich und super aufmerksam. Freies Wlan gibt es vom New York Hotel noch obendrauf. Was will man mehr?! :-)"}
{"text":"Food pretty good had Bahn mi tacos,spicy!!! Service, not so much...server did not ask if we wanted glasses for our beer, brought our order but no plates, had to ask for them, then when he bought them he just sat them on edge of the table and left."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch after seeing they had Lobster Mac & Cheese. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was cold and tasteless. Not to include there were giant knats flying around us as we are our food. On the other hand the Brussel sprouts were tasty but needed to be cooked more, and their cheesy polenta was delicious and so were the ribs. Over all the experience was not worth the 85 dollars we spend on our food."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I was in a party of 6 and we came on a Monday for brunch. It wasn't busy at all, we were seated right away. We were handed menus and it took awhile for our server to take our order.   We ordered a variety of dishes: salted caramel French toast, an omelette, filet mignon with eggs, two of the breakfasts, and two burgers. We ordered the french toast as an \"appetizer\"  The salted caramel french toast was average, it was warm and the caramel added just enough sweetness that I didn't need to add maple syrup.   Almost everything else was horrible. First off, it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out. If the restaurant was busy, I'd understand, but it wasn't busy at all. And when our food did come out, it was grim. We asked for eggs to be scrambled soft and they came out like hard jello. The omelette was completely cold. The hash browns that come with the meal were disgusting. I understand that they melt cheese on top of it, but it was barely edible. The filet was supposed to be medium rare, but it came out black and blue. The only average things were the burgers and that's because they were hot.  We asked for the food to be sent back. Someone came out and talked to us, but made it seem like it was our fault that the food was like that. He told us that the omelette was going to seem cold because of the avocado on top. Yes, the avocado was cold, but I didn't realize eggs and bacon were supposed to get cold because of that too. He eventually took off the breakfasts that were sent back.   Definitely wouldn't recommend this place. There's so many better places on the Strip!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and music.  Stopped in for a beer that wasn't nearly cold enough  though.  Update - thanks for the reply Dylan. No we just stopped in for one beer and both were just barely cold so figured they all were. Not a big deal...I just like really cold beer."}
{"text":"Our server Eddie is a rockstar. Fast service, food arrived quickly and it was more than we could all eat. Crispy Brussels sprouts are the family favorite. Lobster shrimp mac and cheese is good. Crispy chicken and cornbread pancake- pancake with the special butter is the best part. Lobster and shrimp tacos were fantastic. My son devoured the half rack of ribs so I didn't get to try that. Must have been good!  Good music and lots of TV's to entertain everyone in our family as our eyes wander around."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic experience with a variety of options incase you have a variety of picky eaters in the group.  Wonderful selection of super fun and different twists on traditional cuisine. We went for brunch and I had the cornbread pancake with spicy fried chicken and it was fantastic. The kids had traditional buttermilk pancakes and they all seemed pleased.  My best friend had the adobo nachos and was over impressed.  A solid decision for reasonable prices"}
{"text":"This dining experience exceeded my expectations. Especially for a meal at 12:30am on a Friday night.   As much as I enjoy eating out, I am not enthusiastic about eating out when visiting Vegas. I expect every restaurant in and near the hotels to offer decent options. I also expect most to have a cool, trendy or themed decor but that's about it. And usually the places are good, but you could easily leave just as satisfied if you had gone to the place next door instead. Or having grabbed a slice of pizza from the fast food joint. Tom's Urban has changed my mind. The food is so much more than the Vegas status quo of decent food.  The menu was pretty extensive and most items (breakfast, sandwiches and spiked milkshakes) are offered 24/7. And if you are having a difficult time choosing between the sweet potato fries and the famous shoestring garlic fries, you can get half and half. How's that for awesome and accommodating?!?!  After a long day and no plans of retreating, we decided to refuel, enjoy the sights, lights and a different location on the strip. We perused the menu and decided to stop in. From the moment we sat down until the time we left, we were pleased. And I seriously enjoyed our dining experience enough to have double back which says a lot.   The service was phenomenal, the patio seating is one of the best on the strip, the food was absolutely, positively delicious and my drink was superb. If I had to choose one word the describe this visit, it would be outstanding.   I came, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will return."}
{"text":"Went to watch game 7 we had a party of 7 and the rules about how long we could stay continued to change first it was as long as we kept ordering we could stay. That was fine then it changed to everyone must order 2 things every hour !!! How our server only came by every 2 hours lol anyway the food is extremely over priced. $14 for 6 wings smh! Food was ok drinks were not strong. And our server was not educated on the menu."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the food alone, service was better than what you can expect at a breakfast diner.  Sever removed one meal (the only one we commented on) from the bill and also poured a couple to go mimosas for the bottomless mimosas.  The Food:  Worst hash browns I have encountered.  They were undoubtedly reconstituted hash browns from a box or bag.  Many if not most breakfast joints serve these prefab potatoes and sometimes they can be decent, these were not!  I think this may be why they come with a slice of cheese melted on top, an attempt to cover the sin of botching these so badly.  The Huevos Benedicto was ok if it weren't for being cold.  It was removed from our bill.  Gigante Breakfast Cubano was the best thing we ordered, nicely grilled sourdough with a lot of ham, cheese, carnitas (I assume roasted pork shoulder), a couple eggs, pickles and mustard also the hash browns, which covered in swiss cheese and eggs and layered between the meats didn't stand out as much as when they were dried out on the side of a plate."}
{"text":"This was my second try at Tom's Urban with my wife after a failure down at the one at L.A. Live in Los Angeles.  This was slightly better but there is nothing that inspires me to return.  We ordered lunch here on Saturday 5/14 and sat right at the edge where the inside and outside meet.  The weather was great and that was probably the best part of the lunch.  Our server was nice but as has been the case with Tom's Urban twice now, the staff doesn't do a good job of keeping on their customers.  Our waters went unfilled several times and in general, while there are a lot of people running food, it seems way too scattered.  It must just be the chain in general.  We started with the Double Dip Hummus with was good but they short you on the pita bread so you end up with half of your dip left without anything to dip with.  So we ordered more pita bread which came out burnt to a crisp so that was that.    My wife ordered the Urban Street Tacos.  She to two of the shrimp and lobster and one of the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi was terrible.  She said it was basically unedible.  The other two were good however.    I ordered the Boulder Club and specifically asked for it to come without avocado and of course it arrives with a nice heaping pile of avocado on it.  It was a bit dry otherwise and the bread was over-toasted which seems to be a theme here.    Since we are 0-2 on this restaurant and that's in two different states, I doubt we will try it again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our experience, and would come back! We got here in time for the tail end happy hour (which they have different specials for each hour), and the deals were still good. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Mac and Cheese, and it was great. Was able to finish it with the help of the others in my group. We also had the brussel spouts as an app which was a great choice. Between the group we had steak street tacos, the ja Popper burger, and the Boulder Club. All the food was good. We really enjoyed our experience with Antonio as our server. For the restaurant being a chain, I would recommend as one of the better options."}
{"text":"There are so many options in Las Vegas and I have been many times and yet I just discovered this place and I can't wait to return!   Awesome breakfast and lunch options of all varieties and they have Bloody Mary's with bacon in them, so good! I went for brunch and got the Figgy Piggy sandwich which was so freaking good I wish they had this restaurant in my home state so I could get it again. It had 3 cheeses on it with a fig jam to top it off. This sandwich came with shoestring fries and the serving was so large I couldn't finish it and saved the rest for later.   I also loved the atmosphere! When we were there recently, they were playing classic 80s music videos on their tvs. Our server was also very friendly and efficient.  The menu also had really fun meal descriptions!!   Can't wait to return to LV and visit Tom's Urban!"}
{"text":"Eddie, was great!  Offered the best choices. Very informative! Atmosphere was awesome! Hoping  food will as good as the service.  Eddie said it would be!  Totally trust in Eddie!  Las Vegas, baby!"}
{"text":"Food was bad. I ordered the prime rib French dip and is was filled with grizzle and was dry. The dipping sauce was thick and the sandwich in general was flavorless. My Friends burger was dry and she at only a 1/4 of it. Too many other options available and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good.  Nice outdoor seating.  Customer service was mediocre.  We had breakfast twice while in town and tried to follow paleo.  We asked for no cheese, no bread, no browns and fruit.  Both days they did not do as we asked- ugh."}
{"text":"I went in with doubts because restaurants like this - trendy, hipster, instagrammy - usually look good but have mediocre food and are way overpriced but Tom's Urban was pretty damn good and the prices were pretty fair considering its Vegas. The mini Mac and Cheese with carnitas and green chiles was amazing, the avo bacon burger was perfectly cooked and I think these were possibly the best garlic fries I've ever had - full of flavor but not punching you in the face with garlic. I regret not saving room for their pineapple upside down cake with mango sauce, thank god there is one in LA so I can continue fattening up in 2015."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Family friendly! ! Great food.  Recommend steak nachos and barbeque bacon jalapeño burger:-)"}
{"text":"The food here is really really good! I was in Vegas for only 5 days, and had to go here twice. Their sausage and bacon are very tasty. All of the breakfast items I've tried were very delicious. My only complaint was the price of some mixed drinks. My friend ordered a drink that was $21. Obviously it's the Vegas strip, but still pricing any drink over $15 is outrageous. Other than that, the overall experience was great, and I will go again."}
{"text":"Returned after getting a comp meal from management. I enjoyed the visit, the waitress was funny and warm. My table ordered the Mac and cheese and Pop tart (apple). Both were good even though I'm not a fan of apple turnover (initially it was suppose to be cherry). The trial by fire omelette is actually spicy. I don't always believe restaurant when they say it is spicy but this one was on point. My partner ordered the chicken and corn bread pancake. It was also good. Finished the meal with the s'mores dessert. Do not order if you are only a table of two. You will need at least 8 people. It was good but very very rich."}
{"text":"The service was great! The spicy edamame was delicious and we got free fries pickles for checking in on Yelp."}
{"text":"This place is so fun with super yummy food and drinks. The employees are all so friendly and happy and the music is great.  Try to pork belly lettuce wraps! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! The decor is awesome, the service was great, the food was so yummy and plenty to share. We are going back tomorrow morning to share this time because I hate wasting. There is an area you can sit by the bar that is an indoor/outdoor feel. very spacious place. It is a great deal for Vegas. It is actually a pretty good deal anywhere. The drinks are a little pricey but was a great bloody Mary! I highly recommend trying this place  out."}
{"text":"This place has a nice selection of beer on tap. The menu has something for everyone. We got a pint of Sierra Nevada ($8) and a Tom's 32oz of Rebel IPA ($15) and a flatbread pizza ($13). The pizza was a nice plate to share. It went great with the cold beers. The bill came to about $40."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while searching for a place to have breakfast, and they weren't too busy, so why not give it a shot.  The outside patio was full, so we were happy enough to eat inside.  My husband found the seating to be somewhat uncomfortable, and said it felt like he was going to slip off the back of the chair.   As we started to review the menu we noticed that the omelettes were made with four eggs.  Holy heck, that is one big omelette, let's just share.  We went with a Denver, hash browns, and my husband got a side of grits, and I added a side of fruit.  This was plenty of food to share. I will say that the omelette was a bit overdone and dry. It was crispy around the edges.     Our server was prompt, and quick to refill my Husbands coffee.  The bloody Mary's here are also very good."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after seeing a show for a late night dinner. Our waitress was very friendly and sat us outside in the patio which is a great place to sit and watch the strip. I wasn't very hungry so just ordered the appetizer of Brussel sprouts and surprised me with how tasty they were! my husband got the 'big ass egg roll' which was basically a fried burrito. We were pretty disappointed with it. We did have to wait a long time for these two items to be served, which wasn't really a big deal to us as we were just enjoying each others company but the waitress brought out two pork belly tacos, compliments if the chef, to apologize for the wait. We were pleasantly surprised! My husband said they were better than the meal he had ordered. overall, not a bad dining experience, but not a particularly memorable or outstanding one either."}
{"text":"I had the treehugger egg Benedict and hash browns. It was delicious, manager came by to check on me and staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Not sure where the great reviews are coming from? My wife and I ate here today,  Easter Sunday and the service was horrible. Our drinking glass had dirty finger prints on the water spotted glasses... pretty gross. Food was ok but over priced for what it was. The waitress wasn't friendly at all. she seemed to have a bit of an attitude. She never really said anything or did anything to us just never said anything when laying the food on our table as she walked by... we had to ask for silver ware no big deal.... We over heard one guy say he wanted to move tables because of her. As a customer I feel employees should treat their customers with a kind greeting no matter how busy or upset they are. Not happy with this place except loved eating outside on the vegas strip."}
{"text":"Didn't like this place, too noisy when it comes to the music playing.   Food ain't that great at all, I got the margarita pizza and that tastes like tomato on uncooked dough."}
{"text":"Omg please change your music!!!! This is supposed to be a hip spot in the middle of the New York hotel in Vegas and the music was enough to make me contemplate suicide throughout the meal. The decor is also kind of trying to hard to be hip but succeeds only in looking like a dusty 70s basement.   The service was great and the food was good. We went for the happy hour at 4 where they have a variety of bites available for only $4, which in Vegas is a steal. We got the tater toes with lemon mayo, potstickers and a mahi mahi taco. All $4 and all good. I honestly might have considered coming back here for something other than snacks if the music hadn't made me want to slash my wrists with the butter knife.   Maybe if I'm ever staying at New York again I'll try and sit outside on the patio and pray they aren't blasting the same awful music they are inside. The menu has some things I'd love to try if I can stay awake."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Had the special blt with sweet potatoe fries and the toms size jerry Mai tai.  Lots of food and drink was strong and expensive.  The sandwich was outstanding and they even gave me a to go cup for my second mai tai,  not that I needed it haha"}
{"text":"Came for Happy hour.  Enjoyed the Brussel sprouts, nicely fried and not too much vinegar.  Had the the chicken potstickers, too much sauce on outside.  Pork belly taco sweet and smoky with a kick from sauce and jalepanenos, good but spendy for one taco.  I enjoyed carnitas Mac and cheese spicy but the citrus aftertaste on the carnitas may not be to everyones liking.    Service was good and had decent suggestions.  Charged too much for taco the Bartender Elaine fixed very quickly.  Great service."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive wait staff,  but seriously mediocre food and the overpriced drinks are probably some of the worst we have ever had.  The music is obnoxiously loud and when we politely asked for it to be turned down we were told that it was restaurant policy not to change the volume on the music, that people ask all the time, but \"management\" doesn't allow it.  So if people ask for the music to be turned down all the time, that truly should tell management that it is too loud!  We were there to eat and socialize, not to have pounding and blaring music so loud we had to shout our order to the server, etc.  I wanted our party of 10 to walk out at that point, but since we made a reservation and the restaurant wasn't too busy due to it being Christmas Eve, we wanted to keep things pleasant.  But we certainly will not return.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good location but slow service and food most likely will be cold by the time it gets to you. We weren't even on a day that was busy. Not worth it..."}
{"text":"Our server Tiffany was super sweet! We stopped in for a snack, beverage and people watching on the patio today. We were a little worried at first since the one hostess was a bit snotty while seating us with our kids. She acted like were homeless people with infants, not well dressed with well behaved kiddos. But Tiffany made sure to make us feel welcome! Nachos were $18 for not much but it's Vegas and everything is expensive. My margarita was wonderful and hit the spot on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon in March !"}
{"text":"We arrived during the mid-day Beat the Clock Happy Hour. Our waitress took about 10 minutes to take our order. I ordered a margarita. She forgot to ask salt or no, so I sent it back and asked if I could have one no salt; she just wiped the salt off of it. We had ordered 2 appetizers, but they came 20 minutes in between. We asked for the manager & the waitress became nicer. I felt like the length of service was designed to avoid \"Beating the Clock\"."}
{"text":"Had the prime rib philly cheese dip and it was good but the meat is fatty and au jus was Sorta gross.  Garlic fries are tossed in garlic oil or something so they're just soggy. Steak nachos don't have \"a ton of cheese\" and was just ok. Old fashions not the best either, tasted like ordering an old fashioned at a club. This plus a glas of Pinot was $69. Plus side was bartender was very cool."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Not quite the famous place as some others but you benefit from that by not having a 2 hour wait. The food was really good, mostly comfort food, and the portions were great. On my next trip to Vegas I would come here again for sure"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was terrible. Our waiter had a horrible attitude and was very unfriendly.  I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt that maybe he was having a bad day but seeing the difference how we were treated compared to the ladies sitting next to us was like night and day....was it because we were a group of gay guys? For the amount of money we spent there I expected finominal service and did not get it."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Frances. Home run recommendations: High Roller (refreshing on a scorching day), duck wings (scrumptious) upside down pineapple cake (heavenly and came out hot and fresh). The food came out quick too. BBQ ribs were soft and tasty (but not hot), didn't care for the hash browns, stick to the sweet potato fries, milk shakes are so-so.   Sit on the patio and its a great people watching. Many people take pictures in front of the resteraunt since it's near the fake NYC bridge. Don't worry  the water misters will keep u cool."}
{"text":"We'd give a 3.5 if we could! We came for brunch on a Sunday. Great deal for all you can drink mimosas- $20! Unfortunately we had to go to the bar every time to get a refill, even sitting in the bar area it was tough to get attentive service. The food was good; there was a mistake with my treehugger eggs Benedict, but they fixed it quickly!  The corrected version was delicious but a little lukewarm. The boyfriend ordered The loaded Mac n cheese and enjoyed it.  Overall fun place to eat, drink and enjoy a football game!"}
{"text":"About a decade and a half ago, this storefront was created and opened as ESPN Zone Las Vegas.  The grand opening was a star-studded event with various athletes and actors brought in for the event with live broadcasts on ESPN.  I know because I was one of the ESPN hosts flown in to do my national radio show at this grand opening and stay the entire weekend.  So many good memories from that weekend, such as me inviting a gorgeous friend named Tanysia from LA to come hang out with us and convincing Trey Wingo that she was actually Carmen Electra. (He still thinks it was her to this day)  Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame was out there too, promoting his big new sit-com on ABC. You probably don't remember it, because it was a complete disaster and was yanked off the network after a handful of episodes.   We had an awesome time, fantastic shows and fun stories such as my pal Dennis Haskins (Yes, everyone's favorite prinicipal) chasing my ESPN producer's friend from USC. I called her Dr. Lush, because she was a damn sexy dentist and she could throw back Red Bull and Vodka like a champ.  Unfortunately, the ESPN Zones in every city died off a handful of years later including this one.   Fast forward to present day and Tom's Urban has completely made this location in NYNY their own with major renovations.  Honestly, it is better than the original tenant. The ESPN Zone was too boxed in, too dark and the menu stunk. Besides, this was Vegas and because ESPN was owned by Disney, nobody could actually make a bet inside the ESPN Zone. They had to go to the sportsbook. Lame.  Tom's Urban really lightened up the place, created a significantly more comfortable atmosphere and knocked out a lot of walls, most notably the ones near the Brooklyn Bridge and Las Vegas Blvd. That is really a nice bar and patio now with great people watching and views of The Strip.  You can still easily watch sports on TV in here, but the place is so much more than that. Excellent draft beer selection, the menu has everything you would want in an American casual dining setting and the Beat the Clock weekday happy hour is also a nice touch.  Put it to you this way: Tom's Urban is everything Beerhaus around the corner is not. If you're attending a hockey game or event at the arena, walk the extra 50+ yards (take the shortcut through the casino) and get a much better experience at Tom's Urban."}
{"text":"Great people watching location. Food and service not great... Had the smothered burrito.  I don't recommend it.. The meat and tortilla was dryer than my sense of humor.  Get a drink and keep moving."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning for breakfast. Hardly anyone in there around 9:50 am. But, somehow, my classic eggs Benedict took almost 30 minutes to get to my table, and when it arrived it was barely luke warm (it had clearly been sitting for God knows how long). After waiting that long, I was hoping for a really great tasting meal, but it was just average. Not sure if it was my waiter or the kitchen that had the problem this morning, but it was enough for me to not be interested in going back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast twice here and thought it was pretty good with ample servings and great taste ! The service was great and a friendly wait staff ! I will have to try their lunch and dinner sometime ! Highly recommend dining at Tom's Urban."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban was recommended by a friend of mine. It did not disappoint. Really good menu and the prime rib sliders were the shizz. (That's teenager slang for \"good.\") But most of all our server Miranda was frickin awesome. I said we should be best friends. She seemed hesitant. But I get it. It's Vegas after all. She needs to be cautious.   I am concerned that the road trip sandwiches are available as a dine-in option. Feels like false advertising. But that's just politics."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Chris was great and very attentive to all. Bottomless mimosas at a great price.  I had the Steak Nachos and they were huge 2 people could have eaten them. They were worth the price.  This was nice getaway from the hustle of the Strip with a great view of it all. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place seemed really cool and we wanted to check it out since we leave in vegas not many times that we go to the strip. But it was a waist of time. We went to the Bar never got greeted by the bartender she looked like she wasn't very happy to be there she asked us what we wanted to drink and gave us the food menu. We order our drinks and right away I smelled bleach inside the glass I looked over the food menu but the smell of the glass started to bother me... I could not  bring myself to order anything the vibe was off the smell was just nasty it wasn't a very long visit we left right away...  We went back to our local bar and enjoyed the rest of the night.:-) finally!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Tom's Urban while we were in Vegas for New Year's. We had one of the best restaurant experiences either of us can ever remember. Our server, Blue, was on the money with everything, from drinks to menu suggestions (and boy, was he SPOT ON with his recommendations). At one point when the boyfriend spilled his beer all over the table, Blue was on top of helping clean up the mess, as well as replacing our silverware and getting us a new beer. He made sure we were taken care of for our entire meal. We were so happy, we asked to talk to the manager to give him and his employees kudos for helping making our New Year's epic and memorable.  The food was also AMAZING. We ordered a few appetizers and it was a great amount of food to fill us up. I suggest the brussel sprouts. Blue did and they are to die for.  That being said, I will be sad if I don't see a Tom's Urban opening in Salt Lake City in the next year."}
{"text":"We found the food here good, don't bother making a reservation because they won't write it down and the hostesses could be a little friendlier. Ours sighed heavily when she said good morning to us the first time we went there. The rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I recommend the pancakes."}
{"text":"I think my picky is showing, because I found this place to be just \"OK\" even though most other reviews are glowing.   Hubby and I came to get some dinner before heading out for a night of debauchery on a Saturday evening. Both of us ordered the Moscow Mule (really quite good, actually) and then he chose the lobster mac 'n cheese and I got the prime rib philly cheesesteak dip. We both liked what we ordered but when sampling the other's dinner were disappointed. Especially when we got the bill...this place is damn pricey for being a fancyish diner (my sandwich was $22).!  I'll also give credit where it is due and say that the garlic fries were pretty yummy. However, it is unlikely that we'll end up eating here again, especially with Shake Shack next door."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all positive reviews, but to each their own.   My fiancé and I came here after taking a hot air balloon ride because he had heard at his conference that this place had a really good breakfast. We get seated and 10-15 minutes goes by before anyone comes by. The waiter who came by dropped of silverware and said he'd be back, which he never was, we got a waitress instead. We order, and again 5 minutes goes by before we get coffee.  Food arrives, we eat, and it's really nothing special. My BLT breakfast sandwich and hashbrowns was not worth the 15 dollars, but my fiancé seemed to enjoy his chicken and cornbread pancake. Needless to say, for the money I paid I'm not impressed and most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here last year and it was a good experience. I am back another year and brought my cousins with me. I was talking up toms urban to them really excited to go there. As we walk up the hostess (Dark haired Mexican girl with braces). We weren't greeted and rudely seated. Sat for 20 minutes without anyone helping us. So we told her we were just gonna leave since no one even greeted us for drinks. She said and I quote \"ok bye\" fast forward to next day morning time. We walk down for breakfast. I said hi I'm back 4 please for outside. She directed us around the corner and said \"btw no outside drinks\" the beer was literally from the NYNY casino after we just put $300 on a roulette table. She is hAnds down the absolute rudest human being I have ever encountered in my life. And I am questioning the person in management/HR that thought she was even qualified to be hired in this establishment.   I am the customer, you are the host. Smiling for once in your life would do you some good."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast. Came for the bloody Mary's.. yum! Food wise.. not impressed but not bad."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good. The quality of it was poor. The service wasn't very good and it took a long time to be served the food even though it wasn't very busy. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Inexpensive for the quality and amount of food they give you. We'll  definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service car is better. All of the servers have been amazing. Tonight is Eddie. He rocked it. Thanks Eddie."}
{"text":"A late dinner while walking the strip, chicken street tacos, good flavorful portions, buffalo chicken sliders with just the right amount of spice and a bacon jalapeño burger with fries, cooked to order and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Kings game at the Las Vegas location*. They have a menu full of everything. I mean everything. It was my first time here. Big place. Nice and clean and well maintained. I don't remember exactly what I ordered at the time but their spinach salad was huge and delicious. A little more to the healthier side. I believe we ordered their wings as well along with other stuff. I will definitely try Tom's Urban again."}
{"text":"We were a group of 16, so I do appreciate a bit of the challenges that can cause. So they split us across two tables. There's a point to this.   The good - not much, sadly. The menu is quite extensive and an interesting twist on various street foods.  The location is good with entrances from the strip and from inside the hotel. The server was friendly and engaging.   The bad - the prices!  Especially on the cocktails.  $22.50 each. And the Long Island Iced Tea was horrible. Truly awful, mainly lemonade not sour mix.  The food was just okay.  I expected more flavor, more spice; it was all a bit bland.   The crazy annoying - it was very warm, so we asked about the A/C and the manager came over and said it was under the control of the hotel and there was nothing he could do. Well, calling engineering is something. Then while serving the entrees, same manager fumbled two entrees and they crashed to the floor.   The total failure - the staff said the could not split the check more than the two tables we were sitting at, not by couples.  Then when the checks were presented everything was mixed up. Drinks from Table A on Table B, appetizers from B on A.  And it took them 40 minutes to correct it. Forty minutes!  Final thought - it's an interesting concept that could be executed better. The staff's attitude is one of indifference since they cater to tourists and locals will avoid."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and I was not impressed, and neither was our neighboring table.   The 'applewood-smoked' bacon has zero flavor. I almost wanted to spit it out.   I drink peets coffee everyday and their 'peets' coffee doesn't taste like peets. It's very watered down. I asked for a fresh pot and it was still weak. Maybe the coffee is old or something because it had a hint of dirt flavor.  Our neighbor also complained that their breakfast had no flavor. They ordered a Bailey's coffee and when complaining that it doesn't taste like Bailey's the bartender came to the table to explain that they've been out of Bailey's for a week and they used something else instead.    Bottom line, their ingredients are cheap and they obviously don't care."}
{"text":"My bf and I were wondering where to go for breakfast and we chose to try Tom's Urban!!! We had passed this place while walking through the Las Vegas strip and we figured lets try it. We were so glad we did. We decided to sit outside on one of the high tables. The weather this morning was nice so it was nice to be outside. I was unsure what to order. The breakfast menu was very appealing and appetizing. I chose to order a grapefruit juice and an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms. Also instead of the home fries I ordered a fresh salad. The food was great. My bf ordered the breakfast burrito and man was that a huge portion. We had a great time. The service was nice. I shall definitely return."}
{"text":"We came here b/c of the 4 star review and left disappointed and certainly not worth the praise. This is what we ordered: 1. Truffle Portobello Swiss Burger and I expected for the high price to melt in my mouth juicy and flavorful, very slight hint of truffle from oil came thru, meat patty was a bit dry (mind you I ordered medium rare),  2. BLT Lobster roll was fishy and the bun seemed like stale left overnight bun, too thick for the lack of lobster filling 3. All American sliders were as unappetizing as it looks... worst slider buns, Hawaiian buns would have been better 4. Kids Cheese pizza - son ate it all so I guess it's decent or that he's super hungry 5. Lemon poppyseed & blueberry pancakes we the best, quite fluffy and delicious  6. Happy Hour street taco, save your stomach and money... Seriously! 7. Tom's Urban's Lemonade - nothing to write home about either.   We've definitely had better and should have went next door to Shake Shack to have better food at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Way over priced, and trying too hard. Super \"hipster\" atmosphere but the food is seriously lacking and the over all experience is not worth the price. Lazy staff and mediocre food. I ordered a burger, well done with no mushrooms. It was rare with mushrooms, and even though the bartender noticed nothing happened. I saw at least two managers just goofing off or hanging out, neither checked in with me as a guest and NONE of them smiled. They all looked miserable and I felt like I was bothering them. Never going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I visited Tom's back in 2016 for Breakfast and then I'm 2017 for lunch and both times i thoroughly enjoyed my food. This past time i visited, i ordered the lobster and shrimp Mac, and it was so good. A generous portion of shrimp and lobster were included in the dish so that's good. I also had the garlic fries which were also amazing. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great bright patio with heaters! We shared a few small plates and beers. It was so yummy! The Mac and cheese with chorizo was savory and delicious! French fries done two ways were good, but the dipping sauces were awesome. Wings were super spicy but kept me wanting more--and definitely caused me to drink more water! Potstickers were just average, nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  College football on several TVS with lots of open seating yet we were seated in a corner by a cash register. We ordered coffee and when they brought it to us we were told they had no cream. I asked for a small shot of baileys in lieu of cream and was ultimately charged $10.50 for the shot. We had to ask for silverware, water and butter for the toast. Bloody Mary's were $13.50 each, we both ordered sausage but one of us got bacon. We had to flag down our waitress for hot sauce, salt and pepper. Overall the meal was very bland, both of us had 2 eggs. Hash browns, toast and 1 Bloody Mary each and the bill was over $80. Avoid this place. Try Americas at NY NY."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague. Poorly managed and run!! 40 mins to be acknowledged after requests to be seated when there was free tables everywhere, spoke to manager Dani who found it more interesting to argue with me then apologies to her customers for the lack of customer service and poor management! If there is a lack of staff on a Saturday night  it's not my problem as a paying customer, I should be seated and served accordingly. Horrible customer service!! A joke really!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Lisa gave us attitude and she ignored our table for 40 mins- while standing around. so we left. locals NOT HAPPY don't go here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! We had breakfast and here's what you should know, come hungry. The portions are huge, I suggest you share..especially the omelets, they use 5 eggs in them. We shared 2 omelets and a side of grits between 3 people and still had left overs. Our server Chester was excellent and had very good suggestions."}
{"text":"We had some appetizers and a drink in the bar last night. The service was great, thanks Christopher! We tried the chicken dumplings and the el carbon taco, the mahi taco and the pork belly taco. They were all really good and flavorful. The pork belly was my favorite but we really enjoyed them all. It is a nice atmosphere and the people are friendly. I would come again to try more of the menu as there are a lot of interesting choices on there."}
{"text":"I was to Tom's Urban after it first opened for a Yelp event.  This was a return prior to a concert at the T-Mobile Arena and since I had a large lunch, I opted to have just a dessert as a snack to finish the food day.  The greeter asked me if I wanted to go into the main dining area or just stay at the bar area along the walkway in NY NY Hotel & Casino.  I opted for the bar.  When I told the bar keep I was just having dessert, he gave me a menu and asked if he could get me something to drink.  Opting for ice water, I was soon given a large glass of very welcome coolness.  After looking at the limited dessert selections, I asked about the pineapple upside down cake.  He said that was their best seller and most liked dessert so that's what I ordered.  I enjoyed watching the tourists going by and within a fair amount of time, a server brought the cake.  It's a good tasting cake with fine pineapple flavor.  I don't think there's anything particularly special about it.  It's good and I might get it again.    Tom's Urban is in an enviable spot with the new arena and the Park.  There is a lot of traffic here and I can see myself coming back for dinner the next time I go to a show at the arena.  The bartender was a gem!  Personable and polite, he's a credit to Tom's Urban!"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. We came here for Saturday brunch around 11AM. We wanted to sit outside on the strip so we waited for about 10 minutes which wasn't had. The atmosphere is very cool and party-like. They have loud music playing and the seating is very close together like a party. They have a nice sized brunch menu and bottomless mimosas. This is what made me come here. I did the create your own omelette and it was AMAZING and big! The mimosas were very strong. I don't know what champagne they use but...usually I do not get drunk off mimosas. All it took was three from here and I had to catch my balance a little to stand. AWESOME! Lol   The service was a little on the bad side. Our server didn't check on us much and she messed up my order. I order sausage on my omelette and she put in bacon so I had to wait for mine to be remade. No apology or anything. We also had to chase her down for our bill. But I will definitely be returning! I want to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"A completely unforgettable meal.  And I truly mean that...I have no idea what I actually ate.  We were pretty hungry after the Zumanity show so we decided to stop in.  The only plus side was that we were able to dine outside and people watch.  While the food did not leave an impression, we had a great waiter.  Fast.  Quick to refill our water glasses.  Personable."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations. After being greeted by the hostess, she had asked if we would like to sit in the lounge or in the front lounge/bar area which they would be able to seat us faster (don't know why she would say that because it was only at 15-20% capacity during our lunch visit) so not busy at all.  Our waitress (Jenn) was pleasant, took our order of a regular cheeseburger and my wife had an avocado sandwich, and I had to repeat myself stating that I wanted my burger well done, as she was walking away she turned around said \"medium well??\" :0/  No, well done as in no red please.   10min goes by.....nothing yet, ok. No problem.  20min goes by and we look over and our waitress Jenn is folding about 50 napkins.. Ok, maybe give them another 5min and ask if our food is ready.  35min goes by and by now you would think placing a patty on the grill and some French fries would be done right? Nope...   43min and we finally look over to Jenn and she's still very busy folding another 50 napkins, we get her attention and she says let me go check.. And wouldn't you know it? She comes back with our food and said \"sorry we were just waiting for the fries to finish\" wtf?!? I don't know about you but since when do fries take 43min to cook?   Food was ok, you can tell it wasn't hot and fresh off the grill and the service was below average.  Had a MUCH better service at Cabo Wabo across the street."}
{"text":"First of all the food is AMAZING. EVERYTHING I've gotten has been so good. They also have fun themed drinks that are quite tasty and a huge beer selection. My favorite thing is probably the people watching if you sit outside. All in all an awesome place to try. Even for locals!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this place. The chicken breakfast burrito was very comforting; it was so big I couldn't finish it. I also had the Garlic parmesan fries, which were decent. I expected actual garlic and Parmesan sprinkled on the fries but after I got over my expectation I was satisfied. For my early adult beverage, I had the Chateu Ste. Riesling which paired well with my burrito. My boyfriend had a build your own egg white omelette with veggies and grilled chicken, cheese/green onion grits, and their signature cheese hash browns (cooked well done). He enjoyed every bite. Our waitress service was a bit slow but overall everyone was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Homophobic assholes. Don't go here... apparently they don't serve gays. All the straight people get seated before us. Must be a cool perk. #newyorknewyork #lasvegas"}
{"text":"Customer service is really good here. They mistakenly gave me the wrong chicken burger I ordered and manager took off half price and got a free dessert. The burger was so delicious anyway and they were able to adjust what I wanted. Will be coming back for sure!! Plus they're menu has a large selection of everything!!"}
{"text":"My rating for this place is more due to the customer service. It would really not hurt them to smile a bit. Also most of the menu is full of pork related items and I don't eat pork so that kind of sucked. Lastly my Benedict I order the muffin was literally stale. Disappointed overall. Only reason for 2 star instead of 1 because there mint mojito Coffee was really good."}
{"text":"My husband ordered eggs Benedict and they didn't toast the Wolfermann's English Muffin, which is probably a crime...though when I mentioned it, they took it off the bill without me asking. The French toast was good, my daughter loved the Prime Rib Sliders, and my carnitas breakfast burrito was good and very filling...my coffee was never refilled :("}
{"text":"Stopped in while walking down Las Vegas Blvd. The service was so so and nothing very exciting."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered tacos and the meat was ice cold. How do you mess up tacos??? I guess it's meant for people who have been drinking and don't care how the food taste, just want to eat something."}
{"text":"Paige was our server. From the moment she came up she was excellent. Very bubbly and friendly service. All food was quick and prompt. Calamari is our favorite and it was so good with two yummy sauces. Super yummy, we love apps and one or two entrees. All I can say is yum!"}
{"text":"YUMMY.  Loved the food.  I have food allergies (Cassen,peanut) they had great options!  We were a party of 20 service was great.  We didn't have a reservation but they got us in fairly quickly.  They have tvs to watch games.  Service on food was great.  All our food came out pretty much at same time.  Everyone was very pleased with their food"}
{"text":"Located in New York New York.  Great food & cool vibe.   Mix playing when we were there was slick.   Friendly staff.   Good service.   A few tvs posted around the place so you might be able to catch a game or two.  Beer selection was quite extensive with many craft beer selections.   Various size & sample beers was done quite well."}
{"text":"Waited an hour in a half empty restaurant.  Food turned up as we walked out...too little too late.  Saw French Toast get sent back believe it or not. There's a million breakfast restaurants on the strip...give this one a miss."}
{"text":"I came here earlier today for some food and cold beer. Both were amazing !! Ashley was super nice and had great service. Ill definitely come back because of her service."}
{"text":"My experience was the worst, I've had better food and service from waffle house. We were told it will be a 30 min water so we sat at the bar but the restaurant didn't look busy. It took over an hour to bring our breakfast ordered food which consisted of burritos, omelets and panckes. once the food finally  came out it was cold, orders were not right, bartender service was piss poor however the mgr did take off some of the food off the bill but could've done a better job with fixing the situation.  Won't go back and will kot recommend."}
{"text":"Waitress was great but the hostess sucked.  Food was delicious. Wife had the pickle brined chicken and I had a half rack of ribs. A LOT OF FOOD.  Good simple American dishes, but with complex underlying flavors..the smoke of the ribs added that underline thread of complexity. Slow cooked meat literally falling off the bones. And that sauce---oh, that sauce--sweet, tangy, smoky, awesomeness. All these amazing threads of flavor had woven a well executed dish.  The chicken's brine marinade made it tender meat and perfectly seasoned breading."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try out a new place out while in Vegas for the weekend.  We ended up eating at this place, it was our 1st and definitely our last. The service was horrible not to mention that the waitress didn't even make eye contact with us. I had questions in regards to the menu and she made a face like I was stupid. Just ignored my question and basically told me are you going to order or if I'll come back when your ready. When she came back with my drink the glass was covered in fingerprints and food stains. I notified the hostess which seems like she felt bad. It took our waitress 15 mins to come back with my drink. When our food came out she passed by us and just said enjoy without stopping at our table. I didn't have utensils to eat my salad. We had to ask for our waitress to come to our table and ask her for them. She was aren't they in the holder umm no.. so she grabbed some from the table behind without even looking and left them on our table. We over heard other ppl at another table complain as well. Management didn't do anything..the only person that felt bad was the greeting hostess. For the price and experience I wouldn't recommend and if u do decide to eat here its at your own risk."}
{"text":"Definitely give this place stars for the ambiance and service. Hostess and wait staff were very friendly and helpful. Our waiter Michael was the best of all! He gave us honest recommendations and kept our party excited about the dining experience despite our jet lag! As for the actual food, it was a bit of a let down. Aside from the chicken lollipops the entrees lacked the meat promised in the dish. Taste is comparable to an Applebee's or Friday's. If I return I would try a sandwich or burger as I think that's what this restaurant would make best."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. I wasn't super hungry so I had the kale and romaine side salad and the Brussels sprouts. I also tried my brother-in-law's sweet potato fries and I really liked the sauce they served with it. Everything was delicious! I'm not giving it 5 stars mostly because we were waiting quite a while for our checks and they didn't seem to be very busy, and we were on a time crunch. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating other than that. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for the weekend and looking for food to eat. With its bright contrasting colours Tom Urban stood out from the bright lights of Sin City.  This restaurant was clean, quick and great service. They were playing great music and good sports channels. It's the perfect setting for a great time.  Our server Michael, may possibly be the best server of the year. He was patient and a great food advisor. He has recommended the eats and don't eats, which made of choosing from the elaborate menu so easy. It is very well appreciated when service attempts to give each and every individual the best experience at that establishment.  My choice of meal was the Korean BBQ burger. It a was mouthwatering, plentiful, delicious, and original. The burger was perfectly prepared with fresh toppings and a perfect height to width ratio. The meal comes with a side of garlic shoestring fries or sweet potato fries. This is a meal to grant a return visit. It's simply amazing.  My experience in this establishment is great and can only hope that more people can experience the same feeling I have. I'm saddened that it is not available in Toronto. However, first pits in Vegas in the future would be Toms Urban."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cuban Carnilita sandwhich and found it just the right balance of flavors and the meat very tender. Our hostess was kind enough to find us a quiet table as the loud background music just about sent us out in search of another restaurant. We discovered Tom's Urban on the last day of our trip. Wish we had found it on the first."}
{"text":"This place definitely surprised me. It's at the Nyny I'm here all the time and have not tried it. I got the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, a Cuban sandwich, and cheddar avocado mash potatoes.  I give the Cuban sandwich a 4 out of 5. It could have been better with more carnitas on it overall it was good just a little short on carnitas.  The lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese was on point! A huge portion too which made it easy to share and worth the $22 it cost. Lots of lobster and shrimp.  The mash potatoes were also good and avocado adds and extra creaminess too it. That with the Mac was a little to much cheese for me and I love cheese.  Good did take a little long to make it out and the place was not overly busy. Service was nice they could have checked on me a little more. If the prices are few dollars cheaper and service a little faster I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"What can I say ... I LOVE TOM's.  we are here 3 times during our trip to Vegas. Twice for Breakfast and 1 for lunch. We sat in the bar area, outside on the patio and the main dining area. All suited us perfectly for the mood we were in. I wish I could remember our waitresses name ( but she was from New York dark hair) She was AMAZING!!!! It was because of her we kept coming back. I highly recommend Breakfast and Bloody Mary's. 4 stars because I was a little weirded out by the open silverware on the table. So it's not switched out between customers. ( weirded out but it didn't stop me from going back ! ) it will be part of my trip during my yearly trips to Vegas"}
{"text":"Great food with a funny nice knowledgeable server (Thanks Joe)! Would recommend for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Yumm yumm yumm!"}
{"text":"I liked the potsticker salad. Packed a bit of a punch, with Siracha drizzled on (ask for it on the side if u need) Hubby got the burger with the fried egg and bacon (name ?) but it looked great and he gobbled every bite. Our fried pickles came out quickly, and were super hot. (You get these comped if you check in here, Yelpers.) They were a bit busy at lunchtime (business conference crowd) and it was a bit warm inside (they keep the patio doors open), but all in all, it was a solid 4. Loved the creativity of the food, and choices on the menu. Eat al fresco for a pleasant time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying our waitress was lovely ! So nice and very good at her job ! Secondly the food was good . Hummus for app (a little bland but still fresh and good) , hubby got the spicy chicken and cornbread pancake (very good and tasty) & I had the shrimp salad (it was fresh but just okay) . I would go back . It's a cute atmosphere & food was good ."}
{"text":"Ate here early in the morning. Just got in. The food was amazing but the service was so awful. Waited forever for drinks, asked for a few things they never arrived. Sad because the for was so yummy. Overcharged us for avocado in the tree hugger Benedict despite the fact it's supposed to come with avocado. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is our regular pre-game for Vegas Golden Knights games. The food is amazing!  This time we had Paige as our server and she was super fun and friendly. Great service Paige!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great craft beer selection including some local options and even an IPA from one of my favorite breweries in San Diego, Pizza Port. I had a few of the street tacos and they were all delicious, my only complaint is there was so much loaded in the taco the tortilla didn't hold up. I had a tough time ordering because there were a lot of good looking options on the menu. The staff were attentive and took care of everything, even when an order didn't come out right they took care of it right away. Great addition to the strip."}
{"text":"Wow! The best Prime Rib Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich that I have ever tried. Great ambiance, great place!"}
{"text":"Located inside the New York New York hotel, with bar area, inside and patio seating. Basically, a bar food menu. I found the food and service to be very average at best. The table areas were not nearly as clean, as I had hoped. They have numerous TVs, to watch sports, but don't ask them to change a specific TV to a specific sporting event. They won't oblige. It is Vegas, so expect a higher cost for average food. There are numerous other choices, along the strip. Unless you can't walk any further or are absolutely starving, then go ahead try it out. I'd personally go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is a go to spot for me now. Whenever I go to Vegas this is a spot I am going to go to. The food was so fresh! You can totally tell from my yelp pictures that I have attached. The fresh veggies in my salad was crisp from freshness. The flavor of my salmon salad was layered with loads of flavors. The Vietnamese plum sauce on the salmon was so good. The sugar in the sauce was caramelized from the cooking process.    The outdoors space is urban and bright. The seats have funky bright colors that gives the space a fun vibe. The space is airy and open. The open outdoor space has an overhead of showering water heads. The outdoor bar is open and large.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Seriously - I don't know why we even did this again. I guess I'm an optimist lol ...  This was a visit that I truly wish had been skipped. Almost 10 minutes before a waiter came over to even greet us - then all down hill from there.   A buddy and myself just wanted some quality people watching with a bit of good food and drink- the people watching was ok. The food, drink and service were an average of less than mediocre, at best. The server had little clue about the menu and even denied having items that were on the menu when asked about them.  Lol it was so bad!   Initially, when we still assumed we might trust the person serving us ... we were directed to order a drink called \"Toms Cup\". This is how found that trusting that the waiter was a bad idea. The drink was gross. Imbalanced and overly sweet - it was just unappealing. Not his fault - but seeing as they were full when we finished the meal - it would have been appropriate for him to ask why they were two nearly full drinks.   We also ordered and fig and cheese sandwich which was the best thing we had - it was served with garlic fries that were almost sufficient. The pot stickers were bland, under cooked and overall boring. Please don't get them.  Neither of us could bring ourselves to complain because we were both in the service industry, and this was honestly just terrible - to an extent that we just wanted to leave and forget about it.   To top it all off - we were still trying to eat some of the food - mainly the garlic fries that were one of the most edible things - but I also asked for the bill so we could go. The waiter brought over the bill and began to stack the food plates - (THAT WE  WERE  STILL EATING OFF OF) - on top of one another, with food still on them.. Literally while we were both still chewing.   I said \"hey man\" we were still eating that. He said \"oh\" and proceeded to unstack the plates and give me the fries that were smashed underneath the other plates. I just looked at him. The guy truly was clueless.   So it was over $50 for two unfinished drinks, terrible pot stickers and a descent fig and cheese sandwich. I will never make this mistake again. There is no excuse for bad service and mediocre food - especially at this price point. It's not going to break the bank - but it's just a waste of everyone's time and money.   Happy eating to you!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat and have a few....or a lot with friends. Music was hip hop and top pop, loved it. Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"As our one and only day on the Strip I wanted to make sure that I tried new places.  This place was actually recommended to by friend by her friend.  So this restraunt is located on the Northern side of New York New York.  This restraunt has a beautiful outside seating area with a bar and the luxury of watching the people on the strip.  This time we decided on sitting inside only because it was a rather hot October day and we had walked from where we parked at Paris Las Vegas.  This is one recommendation I do have: since you will be walking all along the strip I suggest parking in a central location so that at the end of sightseeing you don't have to walk to the other end of the strip.  So for me a day my friends do the central location was at Paris Las Vegas.   As we sat inside I noticed that the booths in the middle of the restraunt were very unique.  They were full Booth seats that wrapped around the table with an opening at each end.  I thought this was a very cool concept.   Anywho onto what you've been waiting for, THE FOOD!!  OK so sometimes you really can't help what your tummy wants and you end up getting the slider cheeseburgers.  Which I will say are amazing!! The flavor of the meat with the melted cheese and toasted bun was basically burger heaven.  It does come with a choice of garlic fries and I'm sure something else buy once my tummy heard garlic fries there was no swaying it.  Now usually when I think garlic fries I think fries with garlic salt.  Oh no not these fries. I believe they took a garlic bath and came out perfectly seasoned which means no normal ketchup for these fried spuds yes friends I'm talking special seasoned ketchup. OK sorry drooled a bit lol Another thing that I would also like to say about this amazing place was that they have an open entrance which means kind of an open wall.  I mention this because during lunch we had some little birdy friends enter and hop around.  They were so cute. This is basically a higher end comfort food place with prices that won't kill your wallet and leave something for all the souvenirs.  Highly recommend trying this place it's amazing"}
{"text":"Pros: Once we told the hostess we had a reservation, we were seated quickly. We requested indoors, rather than outdoors (it was windy & hot) and they were accommodating. The food was good. I loved the Nashville Hot Chicken; but even more than that, I loved the cornmeal pancake that was underneath the chicken. It was a large portion, so you could easily take half to-go.   Cons: People without a reservation were being turned away, and even though we had a reservation, we had to wait in a line 12 people deep at the hostess stand in order to be seated. Our waiter was not good. I ordered a mocha (it's on the menu) and he said back to me, \"A what?\" I said, \"A mocha.\" He said, \"What is that? I guess I could get you one, but our machine we use to make them is broken.\" I said, \"I guess I can't order one then, right?\" How was he thinking he was going to get one for me if the machine was broken and he didn't even seem to know what a mocha is? It was a weird interaction. He was also extremely slow to bring our check. We asked for it, because we were going to a concert after we finished eating -- which he knew, because we had told him -- and it still took him at least 15 minutes to bring our check. There are other places with similar food and better service. It's also a personal annoyance of mine when a place serves Pepsi (which I despise) and they don't also offer Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"WoW! What a different experience this was. After contact with on of the managers about my earlier review we decided tot give Tom's Urban a second change. Everybody deserves one, and we really want to like it. It's nice to see a new restaurant with Strip view in the neigbourhood of our hotel (The Signature).  We made reservations without any special request. Upon arrival (7PM) it was not very busy so we had a choice of tables: inside, at the bar or on the patio overlooking The Strip. No hard choice. Overlooking The Strip. For our standards it was a very nice evening to sit outside. And we're glad that since our first visit about 10 years ago the're much more terraces. Maybe not for July/August, but perfect in spring and autumn. Tom's Urban and the surrounding area are a big improvement.  Elizabeth made us feel right at home with some good suggestions on the eating and drinking menu. Also giving our visit a personal touch by telling us something about her passion (travelling) and here home state. Which we visited on a prior trip to the USA.  We ordered Duck Wings and Ginger Pot Stickers as an appetizer and The Chicken and NYNY Steak as entrees. With garlic fries on the Side.   The appetizers we're really nice. And if you order them: don't skip the salad under the Duck Wings. It's great! Not just decoration ;). And I even think we like Duck Wings more than the more obvious chicken.  Service was quick, friendly and genuine interested. The food was all sizzling hot upon arrival. The only thing you can say about the entrees is that the're no lady sizes. Pfff...I really digged in, but by the time I exploded I wasn't even halfway the plate.......We declined on the boxing offer. I know you've paid for it so it's yours, but we think it's not giving credits to the cook. Reheated is always less attractive and that will be your last experience, not the better earlier memory.  Biggest thing we regreted was that there was no room for dessert. And we really looked forward to the Cheesecake. Well, a good reason to return in September.  All together we had a great evening. Due to the nice food and drinks (try the pineapple cider!) and definitly because of Elizabeth. And looking around us we're not the only ones having a great evening. A lot of smiling faces around us. From staff members and guests.  We'll be back.  (Excuse any grammar or typing mistakes. I'm no native speaker)."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal at Happy Hour with tacos, Brussel sprouts (awesome!), fried pickles and sliders. Good drinks and good food and reasonable prices for happy hour especially."}
{"text":"The pop tart was pretty good, but everything else was incredibly sub par. Coffee tasted like water. I ordered the BLT breakfast sandwich with extra crispy bacon. Distinctly called out wanting the extra crispy bacon because floppy bacon makes me want to puke. My wife and I's breakfasts arrive with: 1) basically raw bacon. 2) hash browns so burnt I could hold them in one hand with no bend. 3) toast so dry and old that you couldn't bite into it.  Don't waste $75 on two sub-standard breakfasts. Go to an IHOP. The food's much better there sadly."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that I would have liked this place. So the facts are, I've ended up eating here 3 days in a row, if you know me that just doesn't happen. The main reason - the service has been outstanding. The food good and Long Island teas worth coming back for. If you're in Vegas worth trying"}
{"text":"After the Golden Knights lost the Stanley Cup championship we decided to walk over and celebrate an awesome first season at this restaurant. It was our first time dining at this restaurant. We ordered the Whiskey business cocktail, Shrimp & grits with pork belly bits, Fried frog legs, Xiangxiang crispy duck wings, fried dill pickles with green chile ranch, chicken adobo & steak nachos, and Ginger chicken potstickers (not in pic). The service was a little slow maybe due to the fact that the game just ended and our server had about 5 tables full in her section at once. The nachos were missing something they tasted plain even with the extra meat we ordered to add to it. The frog legs and the duck wings were the best."}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant inside NY NY, TU is a step above.  I had the Hangover Slop Hamburger with garlic fries and it was quite good. Prices are a little high but well worth it. Menu is very interesting and has some great food items on it.  I can't wait for my next visit to try some of them."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacons cheeseburger and it came with no bacon, friend ordered food and food took an additional 10 minutes to arrive. Garlic fries are very greasy.  Burger is average and rather eat at McDonald's, why come to Vegas and get this kind of crap!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in while trying to find a good brunch deal. Was told by the hostess it was a 20 minute wait for a table but the bar was open seating. We walk in and half the restaurant is empty and the bar had maybe 4 groups sitting at it. We sit down at the bar and do receive menus quickly, yet just as quickly my husband notices a giant glob of syrup on the bar. He asks for a wet rag to wipe it up and we have to wait about 10 minutes for someone to come wipe it up. While wiping it up the waitress asks if our drink order has been taken yet and we say no and she walks away and starts serving another customer who walked in after us. At this point having waited almost 20 minutes just to order drinks we end up leaving, since we don't have eternity to wait for breakfast. Seriously the most pathetic bar staff I've ever encountered!"}
{"text":"So far so good. Bartender was awesome. We had a check in from yelp for fried pickles. They were delicious highly reccomended. I ordered the jalapeño popper burger dh ordered the urban slopper. Jim the bartender he was awesome. Shout out to Jim.      Burger was delicious not drop left on the plate. Shoutouts all the way around. Food was great service was great. I would definitely return when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is just a tourist trap... We are locals and came before a concert. Ordered the nachos which had cold shredded cheese with hot fake cheese poured over it to make it hot... Sent it back and came back hot on the outside and still cold shredded cheese inside.. The Philly cheese steak was just Ok and the garlic fries were good and garlicky.. Next time I'll have dinner closer to home and avoid this place...  The table next to us was told they were out of 22 oz. mugs & told them the 16oz plastic cup was the same size... Just wrong... The menu looks amazing but the don't deliver..."}
{"text":"Subpar. The drinks may be decent, but the street tacos are not the great. Plus our waiter entered the wrong amount so we got 3x the amount."}
{"text":"Very very slow service, it took the server 15 minutes to come to our table just to welcome us and ask what we want to drink. And another 10 minutes to bring the drinks.  The salad was very small and when we asked why yesterday it was much bigger the server said he doesn't know . Definitely not coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and awesome location!!  Perfect people watching, TV watching and a good variety of tables, loungey chairs, high tops and bar seating!  My kind of joint really.    Service was okay - she was right on time and just as she should be.  Not super friendly, but that doesn't bother me.    Two of the four of us had sandwiches and they were enormous!  I had the carnitas tacos and they were delicious, nothing memorable, but they were good.  I loved the fried pickles and chicken wings we ordered for appetizers too!  Great options on adult beverages . . . . truly no complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Avoid! I had a pang of guilt giving my leftovers to a homeless guy. \"Duck\" wings are actually duck sauce - flavored - chicken wings. Brussels sprouts slathered in sickeningly sweet Asian sauce. Pre-mixed drink was weak &, as it became clear one should suspect here, too sweet. Service was pathetically slow for what appeared to be a slow night."}
{"text":"Not vegetarian friendly.  Not customer friendly.  I asked for water.  Basically choked on edamame. Asked. Still didn't get it. Had to go to bar and get my own water. Was not happy with the meal I got, and instead of asking what I need/want the waiter was like \"well I told you what it was\"   Hmm.  Ok.  Never going here again. Even if there's a free Brussels sprouts/fried pickle offer when you check in."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, good sports in TV, bottomless mimosas (heavy on the champagne)!!!!! Steak nachos were fantastic. Service was ok...only reason for one less star."}
{"text":"Food. Seating. Service. All excellent! Get the basket of chicken with Fries and fried pickles! Yelp Check in gives you a free pickle or brusselsprouts app :) yay! Our waiter Eddie was also excellent! Thanks again Vegas for the perfectly breaded chicken."}
{"text":"The location was great and their happy hour deals are pretty good as well. Unfortunately that's all for the positives of my experience.   Our waitress was not helpful and even rude. My vegetarian friend wanted to try one of the burgers without meat and the waitress said with tons of attitude \"it's a burger, what's the point of getting it without meat?\". For meat lovers, this is a good point. But as a waitress your job is not to judge or lecture your visitors. My friend felt bad at ordered an appetizer instead. I ordered half sweet potato fries and half regular fries with a side of the avocado chicken tacos.  The food arrived around 25 minutes later and super cold. I would've kindly asked the waitress for warmer food but she just dumped the food on our table and left as fast as she could. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. I wanted some ranch to make the food a little edible since I hate wasting food. I went up to the host and asked for ranch (our waitress was still mia) but with even more attitude she answered \"your waitress can get you that\".   Worst of all is that the you place wasn't even packed. Such a horrible experience"}
{"text":"Drinks were good and pretty strong - worth the money. The beef nachos - do not get. The description on the menu says the nachos are \"decked out\" in beef but when we received them they barely had any beef or cheese. We returned it and the chef added more beef but he told the waitress to charge us. She didn't because she knew the nachos weren't matching the description.  We won't be back, it just wasn't great."}
{"text":"We had good service, the place has a great atmosphere, and the food and drinks were very good. Take advantage of the happy hour, while it is offered."}
{"text":"Came for brunch while watching the game. Bottomless mimosas for $19 bucks is a steal, the food was AMAZING. The service was also great, the manager was the friendliest I've seen in this town, really great people and great food! Can not go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"You're in Vegas looking for a special meal. There are restaurants everywhere you look. You can't decide where you should fill your appetite. Allow me to help. Tom's Urban is a brand new, fresh, unique, delicious twist to a classic American cuisine for the whole family. The restaurant is gorgeous. Everything is modern- from the dozen flat screen televisions to the beautifully decorated walls. The staff was incredibly welcoming. We were warmly greeted at the entrance and shown to a comfortable circular booth. Our waiter, Alex was fantastic. He's the type of waiter we all enjoy- down to earth and able to answer any type of question. I was extremely impressed by the menu. All items had a unique twist, like a \"Big Ass Eggroll\" and a \"Korean BBQ Burger\". We made up our minds and ordered. The appetizer, Buffalo Wings, came. They were spectacular. A spicy chili sauce coated the six meaty wings. They were juicy inside and had a buttery finish. Definitely a wing to write home about. For the main course I enjoyed a burger and fries which were perfectly prepared. Tom's offers a half pound burger cooked to your liking. The fries were shoestring cut with a garlic finish. The food was perfect and I can't wait to come back to Tom's on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"We arrived about 1030 pm and easily were seated in a near empty restaurant, I should have taken that as a hint of what was to come. My wife ordered a mixed drink and I a beer, I chose the steak tacos and she got the ginger potstickers to open.  Pot stickers arrived and tasted like they had freezer burn, The beef in my tacos ended up being pork with a chalky fried liver texture, the salsa was just present for color. I advised the waitress that my tacos were pork, and easily shredded a chunk of the chalky substance to show her the white meat. She said it can't be pork, and looked at me like I was an idiot.  I decided I was not going to gamble on whatever else came out of the kitchen. In retrospect Toms Urban is a bar, that thaws out food served by barmaids. I will recommend it if you want a 12 ounce, 7 dollar draft domestic beer. The food is better at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Returned for a second night because the food and service was so good. Requested to sit in Jeannies section because she was such a delight the night before and we were not disappointed;) Every one in our group enjoyed the night. Keep up the good work Tom's Urban and you will continue to get great ratings!"}
{"text":"Two breakfast stops while in Vegas for a convention were completely necessary considering they served alcohol as soon as they opened. Their Bloody was ok but they couldn't keep the Irish coffee coming fast enough, day two.  Outdoor bar seating was nice considering the weather and accompanied by an attentive barkeep who offered me a sample of something on tap I was looking at.  The eggs Benedict the first day was average; the ham being the most boring part of the \"sandwich\" while the sandwich the second day (my coworker got the first day) was very good and outrageously huge.  Considering it was right off the strip and opened at 7 am, I'd make this a pretty good option if I have (yes, have) to go back to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Best experience in Vegas! We had bottomless mimosas on a Tuesday morning and my husband and I split an omelette (they are 4 egg omelettes--huge!). Our waitress Rosa was so helpful, kind, and suggested some great things to do while we were there. The manager Ron was very helpful and accommodating as well. Would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were down wanting to watch some of the games and eat some food by the strip and decided to stop in Tom's Urban and let me tell you talk about shitty service rude staff that have no personality and a manager that sits on his ass and doesn't do anything to help this is the place. With vegas being a hospitality based hub this place is awful I would not recommend coming here to even use the rest room save your time and go somewhere else, I would give this place negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"We had a great time! There was a lot of variety to choose from, and everything we ordered was delicious! Nate was awesome, he helped us figure out what to order, gave amazing service and was a lot of fun. The location along the strip was also very nice."}
{"text":"Dani was our bartender and not only did he go the extra mile with making us awesome cocktails he also made some great food recommendation. Stop over even if for just one awesome drink!"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is great and Maggie is just awesome. I've eaten here 3 times over the past few days and she has offered consistently solid recommendations from the menu. The lobster and shrimp tacos are delicious, as is the prime rib Philly, but what I am going to miss the most is the pineapple upside down cake! OMG I hate we don't have one of these in Atlanta."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 8. 5 of us ordered different things, all 5 we're hella good! Shrimp mac and chz, burrito, burgers, sliders, philly cheese were all good. Aaron the GM will guarantee good service/satisfaction! Ask for Miranda to be your server, you'll be happy"}
{"text":"We came here to watch the Warrior's game against the Rockets. We got to sit in front a good sized TV of our choice. Instead of going to a crowded bar to watch, we went here as it was not crowded. Now, I understand why it was not crowded. I was not very impressed with their choice of food but drinks and service were good. The waiter seemed discouraging on questions about their dishes. The prices for appetizers were a little too much if you ask me. We wanted to spend money on apps since we would stay to watch the game but that didn't happen..   The Colorado Calamari we ordered was small and super salty. I didn't like the breading they used or the sauce. I basically ate most of the jalapeños in the dish. We also ordered Buffalo wings. Very little for what we paid. The wings were pretty decent but it was just coated well with the buffalo sauce. Again, it had the same sauce as the Colorado Calamari that I didn't like. We didn't want to try anymore as after those two apps, it might be the same. We had their drinks. I ordered the 32oz souvenir cup with their Sin City Punch. The drink was ok. After awhile the coconut milk was separating and started to taste weird. I liked the souvenir cup but it was plastic and I paid $32 for this? I am not sure I would go back here. I can tell the food is not all that especially for the bill we got at the end. The service was the best part and able to watch the game. Go Warrior's!! =)"}
{"text":"I had called 5 minutes before we actually arrived at the restaurant and the person who picked up said that there would be a 5-30 minute wait depending on how soon we would arrive. I also mentioned that we were 7 girls and I was told that it would not effect the wait time. We were pretty happy to have finally found a restaurant that did not have and hour+ wait time so we gave it a try. Once we got there we were told that we might not be seated because we were 7 girls and they might not have a table for that many. I was pretty confused since I had just talked to that person on the phone. We did get seated after the manager helped set a table up for us. However, when we got our food the majority of us were not satisfied, but we also did not want to be rude and send it back. When the manager came over to ask us if everything was ok one of my friends explained to him what went wrong and he took care of us throughout the rest of our time there. Very nice manager and restaurant, but the service/food was not that great :("}
{"text":"Tom's is a plain sight hidden gem located in  the NYNY casino. They offer a full menu, including brunch and bottomless mimosas.  The food here is excellent, filling, and beautifully presented. My family and I opted to have the breakfast menu option. I choose the BLT-ECM( egg,cheese, mayo). It was packed full of each ingredient. They use applewood smoked bacon and fresh lettuce and tomatoes, all on toasted sourdough bread. It's also served with Asedero hash browns( asedero is a mild cheese). The sandwich was delicious. It looked and tasted amazing. So much so, both my son and my husband requested I \"cut\" a piece for them to try. The small bite they had left each of them wishing they had opted for the BLT as well!   The seating is abundant with a natural flow to the arrangement. A party of 1,4, 7, 10 could all be easily acclimated with opportunity to still remain near your party for conversation and enjoyment.  The staff are pleasant and take great care of each customer."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this restaurant since it was right on the strip but we were super disappointed. The waiter seemed kinda chill at first, chatting with us but after the initial conversation he disappeared a lot, and it wasn't that busy. The calamari we ordered was amazing but that was the only good thing about our meal. I ordered the carnitas Cuban and in the description it says there's supposed to be pickles on it but half of the sandwich did not have pickles and the carnitas lacked flavor. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib sliders, and they were messy and flavorless as well. The French fries he ordered were very oily. Overall we spent close to $80 for sub-par food. Probably will not return to this restaurant ever again"}
{"text":"We went in late for a bite to eat and practically the only other ones there but the waitress was so so sweet and the food was so good. We are so glad we stopped by and will be on our list for a light bite n happy hour when we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"During a recent Vegas trip, we decided to eat here after a long day of wandering the strip and being indecisive on what to eat and finding a lot of places closed. (Note: I would not recommend going to the strip so close to Christmas because a lot of places were closed for the holidays.) We finally decided on this place because they had a nice outdoor patio, so we could people watch. Plus, the menu was intriguing. We ordered several different items and most were really good.  Fried Pickles: these were good but the sauce that came with them really made them awesome.  Brussels Sprouts: these were good but they were too oily. Cheese Grits: these were my favorite - hot, ooey-gooey, and delicious.  Margherita Pizza: I didn't try this but my in-laws really liked it and devoured it. Treehugger Eggs Benedict: I didn't try this but my sister-in-law loved it. It had avocado instead of meat and came with hashbrowns. Apparently the hashbrowns were the best part.  Overall, I enjoyed what we ordered and the atmosphere. It wasn't really busy - which was nice - and the waitstaff were friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 8 just for the alcohol infused milkshakes. They are delicious!! Too bad the service here is absolutely horrible. The servers seemed annoyed that we only ordered shakes and we had such a hard time finding them to get our check and pay. I'll think twice before we come back again because horrible service ruins a nice time out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. My chicken tacos were ok, not great, but my friends steak nachos were amazing!! She got a drink that was delicious but 25 dollars once we got the bill. So a little pricey depending on the drink you get!"}
{"text":"Came here today despite the bad reviews and I'm sorry we did. Our waitress was not friendly at all, got our order wrong and forgot to give us part of our order. When our food came out it was wrong and we couldn't find her for 10 minutes to let her know. I had to get up and tell the hostess to please find out waitress. She finally came by 5 minutes after that. Such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding had pulled pork sandwich one of the best i had. All fresh ingredients well worth the visit. Now I'm looking to see if they have one back home..lol"}
{"text":"Breakfast: excellent food and big portions. I have a 4 egg omelet with hash browns and a side salad (instead of bread). Spiked shakes are big, expensive, sweet and good, but you probably want to share. Breakfast burrito was also delicious. 4 stars  Lunch: disappointed we missed the cutoff for breakfast so we got lunch instead. Kitchen took forever. My salad didn't come with dressing which was odd. It was the arugula salad and had more wilted spinach than arugula.  I would come back for breakfast but not lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, do not go here if you need gluten free food. I tried calling ahead of time and no one answered the phone. I then sent an email to which I never received a reply. I hoped to inquire about gluten free items. We decided to try anyway and upon entering the restaurant and speaking to the waitress when we asked about gluten free she started talking about vegan food. After some frustration, because when I want gluten free directing me to your gluten filled vegan options is not the way to go, we decided we would have to go eat elsewhere as they apparently have nothing gluten free or just didn't want to offer us any gluten free dishes. The staff is rude and incompetent. I really wonder how such a place stays in business when there is so much competition in the area? Just go elsewhere, the options are endless in Vegas, don't make this one of your stops. Of course if you like greasy cheap, low quality food then stop in. Thats all we saw when we looked at other peoples plates."}
{"text":"It just opened up and the food is delicious and the staff is friendly. It has some potential. The pineapple upside down cake dessert is to die for. Its made to order and it was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on eating here at about 1:30 am, but I think it is a solid 4 stars, maybe 4.5.  My friend and I arrived in Vegas pretty late and were looking for a meal, not just a crappy fast-food snack. We trekked from the Luxor to NY NY to find it, and I'm glad we did.  I ordered a choose your own omelet, prepared as scrambled eggs, with spinach, shallots and cheese. It came with cheesy potatoes and toast. The portion was huge, 4 eggs!, but it was tasty.  My friend ordered the Chicago dog, and she enjoyed it too. Our server was friendly, and all in all, a great dinery type place to try."}
{"text":"Happy hour is bomb!!! Food stays hot while taking your time to eat. Sweet strip view and drinks are strong not watered down! Best fried pickles and sweet potato fries!!!!!!"}
{"text":"pros:  -pancakes were perfect. -hash browns were amazing with cheese on top  -drinks were great  -service was better than any other restaurant in the strip. Waiters and manager checked on use several times.   Cons: -steak was asked to be medium and was given a well done steak.  -duck wings were tender but REALLY salty.   Overall a good restaurant. I'll probably stick to the breakfast items next time I come. The vibe of the restaurant was really calm and mellow."}
{"text":"Love Tom's! Order the small plates and share. So good. My mouth is still burning from the ghost pepper wings - in a good way. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Margo, the server my mom and I had during our visit, was awesome! She was attentive without being over-bearing and laid back without seeming like she didn't care. I would give her five stars. She helped custom make a beverage for me.  The atmosphere was nice. Not crowded - we were there on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a nice mix of music selections from various decades with cool videos as accompaniment. I like the open floor plan and decor.   The food was just okay. It was kind of non-descript and lacked flavor. I've been to farm to table restaurants that seemed to use seasoning that enhanced the natural freshness. The best item, to me, was the garlic french fries - which weren't all that garlic-y, in my opinion.  I'm glad I tried this place but I probably will not return. While the service and environment were enjoyable, I'm a foodie so I expect more in that area."}
{"text":"Came here after refusing to wait in the mile long line at shake shack.  Was skeptical at first as at first glance it looked like a tourist trap place.  But doing quick research was pleasantly surprised by some reviews.  A bit pricey but this is a nice spot with good people watching seats so ofcourse there will be a premium.  I ordered the shrimp and grits which was great.  Just wish they put more crispy pork belly in it. Also tasted some of the carne asada from my wife's nachos and it was really good."}
{"text":"Great drink menu. Food menu is creative and different for Las Vegas. I call it American fusion. A picky eater like me had no problem finding something on the menu. Service is A+ and the management seemed to care not only about the customers but the staff as well. One knock was the hostess stand. Seemed a little disorganized but it is opening week so they get a pass. Did I mention the drink menu........fireball in a milkshake!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Over all best of the best , great staff , bartender Chris was awesome and manager Jonathan was amazing as well made you feel comfortable best place to hangout"}
{"text":"Page was our server and she was on it! Quick to take our order, quick with our drinks and refills! The atmosphere was excellent a the happy hour is awesome!! Hit it up when your in the strip!!!"}
{"text":"Freaking BOMB Macaroni & Cheese and Everything Else was Awesome as well great Service again everything was OUTSTANDING"}
{"text":"The waiter was very nice and informative. However, the food, specifically brunch was horrible. It looked amazing but lacked flavor. The waiter also \"forgot\" to add bacon to my omelette."}
{"text":"Nice spot to people-watch. It was enjoyable at night outside on the patio. The pulled pork sliders were yummy, but the garlic fries that came out with them were matchstick style and cold. Asked to have them exchanged for the kale side salad which was just OK. We shared the fried pickles - don't forget to let your server know when you check in for your free fried pickles or Brussels sprouts! They were interesting, and pretty good. Beers were over $9, kind of high. Overall a fun experience with good food."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast for 2 days in row during my 4 day trip to Vegas this past summer. We scored the same waiter who was beyond awesome and kind enough to keep me a company for a bit when my husband had to jet to get ready for a wedding. The pancakes are Huge and delicious. I really enjoyed sitting outside in the shaded area drinking hot coffee when it was 95 degrees by 9am (I'm serious). The waiter and those pancakes was what made us chose this place again."}
{"text":"Restaurant located inside the New York casino on the first floor.  The waitstaff seemed to be confused with one person taking our order but then other staff coming over to get our order when it was already placed. The service was on the slower side.  For an appetizer I had the fried pickles which was a small portion but it was good. For my lunch I had the bacon polenta breakfast bowl. I really enjoyed it. The polenta was excellent.  The prices were not bad for being on the strip."}
{"text":"Great place at NYNY! Fun vibe and good food. Had the lobster/ shrimp tacos. The manager let me substitute one chicken taco with the order, which was amazing as well. So accommodating. Fun vibe, decent prices, and good food. :). Thx"}
{"text":"Good food. Good vibe. Horrible Service.   The service was so bad that I had to take 2 stars out although their food was really good! I came here with my friends for Sunday brunch during our Vegas trip. The restaurant was busy because a lot of people came here to watch the game. However, our waiter was only serving a few tables and he was neither attentive nor friendly! I think he was too busy watching the game..  The food was amazing though! We all got different things and they were all delicious! My classic egg benedict was huge and flavorful! And oh my their hash brown was exceptional! it seems like they put a layer of cheese on top of the hash brown and baked it to get that golden brown crispy edge. This place is perfect for brunch and happy hour starts at 3pm with cheap beers and appetizers!"}
{"text":"All I want to do is leave 5 star reviews. Don't you? I'm not a pretentious jerk, I just had a really bad experience at Tom's. Unfortunately it's all due to one server, Eddie.  The big issue was when the bill came and it looked like I was overcharged for my food.  I thought the $6 happy hour tacos meant that the 3 tacos that were normally $17, were $6.  What a deal!  Nope, I was wrong.  The tacos were $6 EACH, which is not a deal.  So when I called Eddie over, all he did was argue with me and tell me I was wrong and that if I wanted, he could charge me $18 instead of $17.  Huh?  Why would I want that?  Instead he just threw up his hands and said \"Fine! I'll pay for it then!  Is that what you want?\" and walked away.  Soooo as soon as he left, my friends explained to me what Eddie failed to do.  That they were $6 each on the menu.  Oh, shoot, ok!  So when he came back to basically throw the bill at us, I tried to apologize (even though he was rude and didn't deserve) and he wouldn't hear it. \"Nope, nope\" and walked away.  Good talk.  This meal could have gone one way had \"the customer is always right\" been Eddie's attitude.  Look, I used to be a server and of course the customer is wrong sometimes, but you have to leave them wanting to come back.  Unfortunately I won't be back and I won't recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable lunch. The music was great! We loved sitting outside ,watching all the people walk by.  Our waitress, Natalie, was very friendly, efficient and sweet"}
{"text":"Located in NY NY Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. The portions are huge, the prices reasonable. What else do you want? Great drinks? You got 'em! A fun Happy Hour? They gots that too.So what are you waiting for? Stop by and try the fun food on the menu. I recommend the Duck Wings! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"By far the best seafood Mac and Cheese! Gotta try the pineapple cider too. Great service."}
{"text":"The service here was awful. We were told to wait for thirty minutes and after 30 told it would be another 45 minutes. How is that okay? Bar service with Victoria was horrible. Hostess Marrissa  was not helpful or sincere at all. Food was cold, bland and not very good. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and service!!  Our server Paulina was fantastic!!! Bloody Mary's were tasty..."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is a win all around. They are located in the new, fun area at NYNY. The outdoor seating is great on a nice day and most seats have shade for the hot days. I started with the carnitas mac and cheese which was very tasty. I could have probably paired this with a salad to make a meal. My husband had the hot brown which he loved with all of the cheese and bacon. For my meal I had the sampler of all of the tacos. Each taco was delicious and unique. The pork belly taco was really good, smokey and crispy."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Tom's and were not disappointed! I had the garlic fries and pot stickers. They both were very very good. The pot stickers were cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor. The garlic fries were perfect, not too overpowering and nice and crispy. My husband had the jalapeño popper burger with sweet potato fries and he was in heaven. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"3 stars?  Lol the food here is like a trailer park mom shopped at wal-mart and microwaved everything while chainsmoking in the living room, then the wait staff looks at you like your crazy for not liking it.  Typical ignorant American cuisine.  I'd wager this restaurant will be shut down in 6months.  Terrible"}
{"text":"Attending their super bowl party. Supposed to start at 2:30. Didn't get in till 3:00. A hundred more behind us.  Bars not ready at half hour. #toms urban disaster."}
{"text":"We had a good experience at Tom's, plenty of seating and a friendly staff. We ordered 2 breakfast burritos, an omlete, and eggs benedict. No complaints except the avocado on the eggs benedict was spoiled! May be a one-time thing, but not something that should be experienced in a restaurant. We also thought it was unusual that birds from the outside would stroll into the restaurant- the doors to the outside should be kept shut if this is what happens when they are open."}
{"text":"Jeanine was great, service was incredible.  She even sang to my sister in law for her birthday.  Got to meet the owner Tom Urban.  She went above and beyond, exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Had a lunch and a breakfast there.    The lunch was good.  We had the lobster Mac and cheese and the street tacos.  Both were good but would probably try something different next time.  With lunch, we had their version of the Moscow mule. It was good, so we had several.  Our service was good.    Their breakfast was amazing (5 stars) . I had filet mignon eggs Benedict and my wife had the french toast.  We both loved both.  We won't change our order next time.  Loved it too much to try something different.  We had great service."}
{"text":"I had been here once before and loved it! That time I would have given it 4 stars this time no way the cut too many waitresses service was bad food was cold drinks were great and the patio is so cool. A little better management is necessary this place could be 5 stars the ambiance is so cool!"}
{"text":"Tom Urbans was a cool place to eat and have drinks. Very nice on the inside of the restaurant  Went during brunch hours and it was freezing in the restaurant which makes your food cool off fast, so I wasn't happy about that. I tried the Lobster &Shrimp Mac n cheese amd that was BOMB!! My husband had the 3 pig omelet with cheese hashbrown and toast he really like it. Our server was ok. She seemed kinda dry and kept disappearing on us,  but other than that it was a ok experience."}
{"text":"On the strip it's difficult to find good bang-for-buck. Tom's Urban does a great job though. The location is great for pre/post T Mobile events and the food and drink have been excellent in my 3 times at this location. Can't complain about the service. We sat at the bar facing the strip after a concert. Wasn't thrilled to get beer in plastic cups--maybe they thought we were traveling. Great selection and service. Decor is nice, would like to make it back for brunch."}
{"text":"The new bar manager is terrible. The old manager was all about customer service. The new guy need some training in that department."}
{"text":"This is now on my list of Go-To places in Vegas for Happy Hour(s) 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 pm (drink/app prices increase $1/hr). And both the drinks and apps offered are THE BEST menu items!! I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea...OMG, delicious with fried pickles, street tacos.  The place is Ginormous, with bars extending into the Casino, a bar on the street, and a bar in between. I chose the street bar, where the bartendress was WORKING HER ASS OFF, professionally serving customers while waiting for the relief bartender to appear! Most impressive.  I strongly encourage anyone wishing to visit the NY-NY side of the strip to target this place 4-5 PM.."}
{"text":"Paige was an awesome waitress. She was kind and very quick on her toes.  Every time I come to Vegas this is my go to place.  The service is amazing and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"We stopped in here and had lunch yesterday. We used the yelp app for the free fried pickles and they were done quite well. I had the chicken and pancake and here was a a little kick to it but the server did a great job saying that's exactly that you get gene you order this dish. My wife and up having the steak burrito got about halfway through it it was absolutely massive!  We sat outside this is a great spot on the strip if you just want to people watch in a pretty cool atmosphere.   Will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here today with a group of friends - Our server was great and the food was excellent. We ordered omelettes, an eggs benedict, and unlimited mimosas. The food was reasonably priced and the portions were perfect. The reason for the 2 star review is that within 10 minutes from leaving, everyone who ordered the omelettes instantly came down with food poisoning. We were all talking during lunch that we wanted to return for brunch tomorrow, but now we're a little apprehensive about the sanitation/quality control in the kitchen... Bummer because everything else was a perfect experience!"}
{"text":"We got the urban breakfast which was ok. We got a half glass of Luke warm OJ that cost 4.25. I hate feeling ripped off regardless of the city. A $42 breakfast! NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"This has potential to be a great Las Vegas hang out for watching games. They have a lot of televisions. The bar is large and there is a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.  The food was tasty and we had a good time. The issue was with the time it took to get food. I am patient when a place is busy, but this was far past acceptable. Our bartender and the manager were both attentive and took care of us while we waited. That is why they get three stars instead of one or two.  The first thing I tried was the Asadero Hash Brown. They are great. The textures and flavors are spot on. These are a very good side for any meal.  Next up were the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. These are exactly like they sound. No need for further description. The buns, meat and sauce are good. These  are a nice appetizer.  The last thing I tried was the Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. These are steamed buns filled with pork belly, Asian peanut slaw and green onion. They normally come with cilantro as well, but I hate cilantro so requested them without it.  If they can get the kitchen figured out we will certainly visit regularly during our Las Vegas visits."}
{"text":"Every time I have come here it has been a long wait. Not to get a table, but to actually get my food. So it was no surprise when it took 30 MINUTES to even get my salad. In addition when my Reuben sandwich came out, it was barely warm. The person I was having lunch with asked for the $20 food special where you get a salad, entree, side, and dessert. When he ordered the chicken entree it clearly said \"original or spicy\" to which he said he wanted it original. So of course it comes out as spicy. When the waitress came over she said \"oh, did you not see that it said spicy?\" to which we reminded her we ordered it \"original\". She then said her and her manager didn't know it came as \"original\" despite it you know, being on the menu. But never fear! They weren't going to charge us for this plate.....but wanted to make sure we still were charged for the pop tart and salad as part of the \"deal\".  So thank you, I couldn't eat my entree but glad to make sure you got the salad and pop tart out of me. Third time is the charm and it's told me to never recommend this place to anyone again."}
{"text":"I had the BC Brock soup it was amazing! Don't forget to check-in for the yummy fried pickles or Brussel Sprouts. Marie was our server she was friendly and provided excellent service. The atmosphere is perfect for chillaxin!"}
{"text":"I was visiting for work and it's a great place to eat alone since they have the bar that's still outdoors. It was during Sunday Football was I was able to catch some games and enjoy my time. The staff was friendly and easily accessible. The prices were affordable ($8-$9 beer) and the food was tasty! I got the burger with sweet potato fries - just what I was craving."}
{"text":"Rebecca was the absolute worst waitress. No personality no smile and took about 12 min just for a water to hit the table another 10 or so to get refills. The food runner ran out pop tart that they offer and had a nasty bandaid on his finger. We had no silverware to eat our food so the table next to us gave us theirs. Rebecca didn't check back once we got out food and my French toast was raw. So I had to walk back to host stand to get a Manager. John (Manager) was nice. Got a new item- pulled pork. Frys were super stale and my guests ordered garlic frys and didn't get the right ones. Terrible service and then brought us the check with all items on it. Including my French toast and new item to replace that so then had to get the check corrected and they tried to \"make it all better\" by sending dessert... it didn't work guys. One waitress to another Rebecca was not personable or attentive at all. We are locals and WILL NOT be back.  To top it off- she brought the bill back with not only the \"free\" dessert on it, but it had 3 additional items we did not order on it. So I left the correct total cash and left. Worst service I've received in a very long time."}
{"text":"A great breakfast or brunch option in Vegas, located out on the NyNy terrace.   We stopped in for Xmas morning breakfast. Were seated quickly by a very happy hostess.   Our waitress was very nice and patient with our questions. We ended up getting a couple of the huge omelettes. My gf added some special orders to hers and sadly the kitchen messed up a bit. The manager was SUPER NICE. They brought us the missing ingredients and yet he still comped the meal for her entree. Wow. What amazing service, friendly and fast to take care of it and all.   I enjoyed my breakfast. Everything was very good. Didn't expect it, but the place was a total gem.   Huge points for the music videos and great eclectic music mix. The decor is super cool and the menu was great...I'll definitely stop in and try a lunch or more savory meal.   Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Super fresh beef and greens. Medium rare burger came out as ordered.  Great service from Joe in the bar area.  Good drink recommendation and knowledgeable about dietary restrictions.  Truffle mayo and housemade ketchup are big hits!"}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast party of 20 on 2/26.  This place was amazing!  They were friendly, clean, modern, accommodating with a fun atmosphere.  The food was SO good and I got so many compliments for choosing such a great place.  The food was comfort food with a boost.  My friend and I split the bourbon bacon Bloody Mary (yum), cherry pop tart(yum) and the breakfast skillet.  The kids (ranged from 2-15 yo) loved everything they ate too. They loved the pancakes with a salted caramel butter and the hash browns.  Can't say enough about the customer service AND great food.  I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Nate was awesome the food was awesome! I love Toms, killer Tacos, killer sliders, killer Hummas, can't wait to come back, this place is great!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after getting lunch for a few drinks. Inside looks modern and inviting, but the scene is on the patio. Great place to people watch. Around 3 pm on a Saturday, this place was not very busy; probably because the specials don't come until after 4 pm. Large selection of beer on tap! Very good place to lounge casually."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and a fantastic Bloody Mary! The hash browns are not to be missed. Our server Bo, did a great job!"}
{"text":"it really wasn't that great. came here for breakfast with my family after a night of drinking -- and come on... anything after a night of drinking should taste fairly good in the morning right? nope! not here! dad got pancakes -- they were nothing special. brother got the urban breakfast platter and it was pretty filling but again, nothing great. i got the breakfast burritos and there was barely any pork in there that they claim to \"smother\" it with.  I think everything was overpriced, but honestly, it's vegas - i get it.  the one thing that saved this restaurant was the blueberry poptarts. those actually tasted amazing. also, it didn't help that the service was horrible. from the hosts trying to find us seats (even though the whole place was practically empty) to finally getting a server to even get some water, it was overall a non pleasant visit."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different from the norm on the strip, I highly recommend Tom's Urban.  The menu is creative but yet still casual and fun.    I tried the buffalo wings, ginger chicken pot stickers, kale romaine salad, and pineapple upside down cake.   The wings and pot stickers were really good, the salad came with a Tuscan dressing that was super tasty, and the pineapple upside down cake was amazing!!!  It was the best I ever tasted!!!  Drink prices are reasonable.  They also sell regular or spiked milkshakes.    You can access the restaurant directly from the strip or from inside New York New York.  It also has indoor and outdoor seating.  Tom's Urban really delivered especially considering it has only been open for few days.  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and the view for people watching was great! We loved that it sits right on the strip and you see all the action. Live DJ was a tad too loud and they also had competing music coming from the bar so maybe coordinate that a bit. The club sandwich is spot on and the tater tots with lemon sauce, delish! Our waiter Michael was a delight and fun to talk to. I would totally recommend to try it out!"}
{"text":"The...MOST AMAZING, burger ever!!! Had the Thai peanut sauce & the American. The absolute best burger our group of 4 ever had. Also the kale salad I would highly recommend as one of my favorite salads ever. In addition to this great food experience the waitress suggested the best yet hike of our trip at Zion (called the subway). Thanks so much. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Has to be the most amazing breakfast I've had in a long time!! The lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes are outstanding.  The 3 little pigs omelet awesome and very flavor able.   The polenta cheese grits are the best grits I have ever had! This is a place not to be missed.  Our server Sam was friendly, sweet, and overall fantastic!!!!!!cant wait to return for breakfast again and again while in Vegas!!!!!! Thumbs up to the chef."}
{"text":"The service we received in the bar left a lot to be desired, and the drinks were overpriced. We were quoted an hour wait outside, but got right in when we checked in inside; however, we specified that we were willing to sit either in or out, at both hostess stations. The menu looked great and I had heard rave reviewes, but the food was pretty basic. I had the Po' boy sliders and my partner has the fish tacos. The sliders had good flavour but the tacos were quite bland. Nothing was really worth the price."}
{"text":"This is a great place to give your wallet a break. They have a great happy hour menu at great prices. I had the Street Tacos & Brussel Sprouts...loved it!"}
{"text":"THIS IS UP DATE 2/26 / 18 ok to start with everything below is the same 1 Christina are seater she is just so friendly, nice just a fantastic person we my son and wife talk for a few and you could just tell My wife and I had person thank you  then there.. was are waiter Ashley anther awesome person we joked with real amazing person very helpful with are menu thank you Ashley got for fried pickles freee ######.

{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and Tom's Urban never disappoints me.  The music and atmosphere is very entertaining.  I love the Bloody Mary's.  So tasty.  I've eaten a bunch of items on the menu and can't say which is my favorite.  They were all delicious.  Ask for Miranda as your server.  She is awesome!  She knows the menu and will give you tid bits on what to eat.  She is a native Las Vegan and knows the city extremely well.  She made us laugh the entire time.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here almost a dozen times.  Sometimes during busy time service can be slow, but today Cheryl was on top of it all.  The duck wings are awesome, so were the eggs benedict, prime rib sliders and the philly cheese steak.  Love Tom's Urban, can't wait to come back.  I hope Cheryl is our server again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by here before a hockey game on Friday night. It's nice to have a place where locals can go and get great service. We were sat almost immediately and our waitress Maha was fantastic. She recommended the brussels sprouts and a Toms Backyard lemonade. Both very delicious. The Mac n cheese and BLT lobster roll is a must try!!! Thanks Maha! I hope you're working the next time we go to a game."}
{"text":"Great service the watier dave is awesome and the food is great and the atmosphere is beautiful right in the strip."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Luxor, Excalibur, or New York New York hotel, this might satisfy your cravings. Toms Urban has a sports bar vibe on the outer area of the restaurant and a classy indoor vibe on the inside (where you can bring your kids). Although they are on the pricier side, you pay for a good portion and a decent meal, unlike the surrounding overpriced and mediocre meals you might get at neighboring restaurants.  I ordered the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese with a side of crispy Brussels sprouts and my boyfriend ordered the philly cheese steak dip with garlic fries. The food wasn't out of this world to the point where I would religiously tell my friends and family to visit, but it is among the better places to dine in, especially if you are a tourist.  There is adequate parking, but as I stated before, if you are staying in any of those hotels this restaurant is walking distance.  On the plus side, if you enjoy breakfast food they serve their breakfast all day. One of the options I was eyeing was the filet mignon steak and eggs, which I'm sure would be worth the money."}
{"text":"In vegas and we were looking for something to eat. As we walked down the strip we came across this place. We walked in and got seated right away. There was a wait if you wanted to sit outsides. So we choose to get seated inside and have lunch. Our waiter was very friendly and on his toes. We looked over the menu and placed our order. Everywhere we go we always order appetizers and notice after the fact that it's to much food. Well this time was no different and not knowing that the serving sizes of the meals were so big we ordered appetizers to start the eating extravaganza.   Mini Mac & Cheese - Pork green chili carnitas with some Pico de gallo and or course mac & cheese. I do have to say it was just OK. I was expecting and nice and cheesy mac & cheese but it was a little soupy. Not what I expected but it was ok.   The Sin City - Can anyone ever go wrong with a burger. This burger was huge and had great flavor. 1/2 pound angus beef toped with american cheese, applewood smoked bacon, BBQ sauce, crispy onions and to seal the deal a fried egg. Yes you heard that right, a fried egg. That egg just add's richness to the burger. Cut the burger in half and only ate one half. IT also came with garlic fries and home made ketchup or at least it tasted home made.   Boulder Club - Now this was a big sandwich. It's a triple decker sandwich stuffed with shaved turkey, havarti cheese, slices of avocado, butter lettuce, tomato, mayo and cucumber all on toasted wheat. My wife really enjoyed it and also did not finish the sandwich because of the size and it also comes with a side of garlic fries.   If you are looking for a nice size meal on the strip stop on by Tom's Urban. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the nicer dining options in NYNY. The menu is thoughtful and creative. We ordered several appetizers and drinks and all were wonderful. I settled on the Banh Mi Lettuce Cups with pork belly and they were too spicy. The rest of the ingredients were great, but definitely need to take the spice level down a few notches."}
{"text":"We tried Toms Urban tonight... What a unique menu and amazing food!!  Our server was Ruth and she did a great job recommending several dishes.  The duck wings were amazing!!"}
{"text":"I visited the location in Denver last year and was amazed. Everything we ordered was out of this world and the service was above and beyond. So imagine my excitement when I was planning a Vegas trip and saw they had recently opened a location in Vegas! My mom and I visited the night we arrived and the location is perfect. Right on the strip, great people watching, lots of indoor and outdoor seating. We opted to sit on the patio and people watch.   We started with the Mini Mac & Cheese Pot (one of my favorites from Denver). It's gooey delicious mac and cheese with pork green chili carnitas and pico de gallo. Not as good as I remembered, but still pretty awesome! For dinner, we ordered the Avocado Shrimp and Urban Chopped salads. They were very generous portions and packed with flavor. I was starving, but couldn't even finish my salad as it was so big.   They have so many other items on their menu that I would like to try, so I will be back when visiting Denver or Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've gotten to visit for breakfast food and for Hapoy Hour. Here's what I've tried and how I think it rates!  CRISPY CHICKEN & CORNBREAD PANCAKE - A sweet cornbread pancake is topped with fried spicy boneless crispy chicken and salted caramel butter, served with a side of maple syrup. 5/5 The fried chicken is nicely seasoned and the pancake had great texture and flavor. This dish is probably my favorite!  HANGOVER SLOPPER* - Beef burger on a butter-toasted brioche bun, smothered with pork green chili, topped with queso fresco, pico de gallo, cheddar & jack, two fried eggs. 1.5/5 The bun was probably the worst part. The patty is nothing special and the pico is a little too spicy for my tastes.   CHILAQUILES A.K.A. BREAKFAST NACHOS - Tortilla chips simmered in tomatillo salsa, topped with two eggs any style, Asadero cheese, cilantro crema, queso fresco, pico de gallo. 4.5/5 How can you go wrong with chilaquiles?! Even though the pico is too spicy for me, I couldn't help but go back for more and more. I think the Cheese helped to put out the fire in my mouth...  URBAN POP TARTS - Apple Filled. 3/5 Nice filling, but not enough icing for my tastes.   BACON TWO WAYS SKILLET - Bacon and pork belly atop cheddar polenta grits plus pico de gallo and two freshly cooked eggs. 4/5 An obvious winner due to the amount of pick. Plus, the polenta was so flavorful and cheesy!!  GIGANTE BREAKFAST CUBANO - Carnitas, ham, hash browns, two fried eggs, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard, pickled onion and kosher dill, piled inside butter-toasted sourdough. 4/5 Another solid choice. Lots of meat and lots of flavor.   SALTED CARAMEL SKILLET FRENCH TOAST - Challah bread with topped with a caramel drizzle and salted caramel butter. 2/4 Skip this one as it's nothing special. The toast itself is just bleh. And there's barely enough caramel to take it anywhere.   Brussels Sprouts - 4/5 Free with check in! These are absolutely drenched in some kind of soy sauce. I happened to enjoy it.   French Fries two ways - 4/5 Half garlic fries and half sweet potato. The sweet potato didn't have a mouth seasoning for my tastes - definitely needed some salt and pepper. But the garlic fries were super solid!  Steak taco - 4/5 Hubby's favorite taco.   Adobo Taco - 4/5 My favorite Taco."}
{"text":"Aweful.   My friend and I sat at the \"outside\" bar to watch the football games.  I made a reservation for 1030.  The girl on the phone was awesome and super accommodating.  When I arrived to check in however, the girl at the front said they don't do bar reservations that it was all open seating.  Okay, so why did the other girl tell me it was fine to reserve the seats - even asked if there was a certain game on that I wanted to be put on the tv. (It was Sunday and we were there for football)    Speaking of asking what I want to watch on tv - we were snapped at when we asked to change the tvs to a different game and were told that managers pre set everything and they couldn't be switched.     The service was awful.  Everyone in that place looked like they had just rolled out of bed.  Maybe that's why they moved so incredibly slow ? My bartender, who never mentioned her name, was less than inviting.  Maybe the service industry just isn't for her ?  She seemed very overwhelmed with the three tickets in her well.   My bacon bloody was far from hand crafted.   It was poured straight from a container.  Whenever we wanted a Refill on our bottomless mimosas - that are served in a stemless wine glass - we were forced to ask.  And then wait.  I feel like all we did was wait.  20 minutes just to take our order is crazy.  Learn to multitask.  Food was alright at best.   We left at halftime.   The only reason we even stayed that long was to watch the game."}
{"text":"I called em up, made a reservation  for lunch,  6 of us strolled right in. The host,  a young man by the name of Logan sat us down and shook my hand saying thanks for coming  (impressive! Personable and sincere) our waitress  was a lovely  gal by the name of Rosa,  again,  hard working,  attentive and kind...She took our orders and kept an eye on us, our drink glasses were never empty.  The food was great.  We had the full gamut between the six of us. Lobster tacos, chimichurri skirt steak,mahi, mahi tacos, 2 orders  of brined Toms chicken (regular and Nashville spice), a cheese pizza for the young one., charred Brussel sprouts and Crispy Duck wings too and we all shared a layered  Chocolate  cake. The steak came out a little to well done, however,  the Manager Jose was so attentive,he quickly rectified  any issues with regard to the \"doneness meter\" and bam....a new order was on the table. The skinny fries were a big hit too. The Price.....one of the best around... you get your money's  worth. And it doesn't  break the bank. Overall , I loved this place.... We were gonna go to Giadas. ..but after reading the reviews  we chose Tom's  and we're glad we did. This will be a staple anytime we're  in LV."}
{"text":"Well, the food great. However, at the end of the night we were asked if we wanted to split the gratuity (we had split checks). First question.... it's a courtesy to leave a tip not a requirement. The server automatically thought we were going to give a 20% tip on top of our $115 bill. To me, that seems like requirement. He would have gotten more if I wasn't asked if we wanted to split the gratuity."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for the Depeche Mode concert at the new T-Mobil arena behind New York New York.  First off, the concert was good. Not great. The venue is nice. Everything is new and not yet banged up. We went to Tom's before the show. Very busy. Excellent location. Outdoor seating faces all the interesting pedestrian activity. Service was slow. Food ok. We started with the Brussels sprouts. Excellent. I had the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake. Very flavorful. The chicken a little TOO crispy. I'd go back to Tom's, but order something different."}
{"text":"Upscale sports bar with an eclectic menu. Unique Happy Hour specials - $4 @ 4pm, $5 @ 5pm, $6 @ 6pm and $7 at 7pm. The edamame appetizer was delicious and the shrimp po'boy sliders were AMAZING! In addition to a great menu, the craft beer selection is pretty impressive. If you're hungry for a great sandwich and a cold beer, Tom's Urban is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Was able to grab a table for 4 after a hokey game. Both drinks and food menu is extensive.. Eddie was a great server. Food was so tasty. Shrimp/grits insane. BBQ sauce on ribs was crazy good. Music was upbeat. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Dropped into this restaurant for a quick bite on a Saturday at 9 pm. Caesar was our server and he was super knowledgeable about the extensive list of beers!!! He recommended the potstickers as an appetizer and they were very good. For the main course we had the margherita pizza and it was excellent as well. The best part was definitely Caesar and his personality."}
{"text":"Stopped here 3 times during our recent trip to Las Vegas.  Had several dishes between the two of us.  Hangover Slopper was great, street tacos(sticky belly, butter poached shrimp/lobster and mahi mahi) were amazing and the Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary was a great way to start the day.   Staff was very attentive and helpful.  Prices were very fair considering the quality and portions.  This will definitely be a stop during our next trip."}
{"text":"Literally 5 stars because of Pete.  He is entertaining, courteous, and is a great waiter!!"}
{"text":"Inside the amazing New York New York lies this wondrous restaurant. Very great atmosphere and dining decor. Food was great. We had brunch and lunch. Our server was nice and efficient. There was, however, an awkward moment when what looked to be the owner or manager yelled at an employee in the middle of the restaurant. Come on, take that into the office, please."}
{"text":"Best food I've had on this trip.  Their version of the Cuban was sublime and the cheddar grits are amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Tom urbans for a good meal and also their bloody Mary's the food and Stabley Schmidt was great a lot of action in a good place to be at on a Saturday have to come to Tom's urban for a good snack and get on with the strip"}
{"text":"So first thing first make sure you check in so you can get your free fried pickles ! Tom's is a trendy place where you can have an intimate dinner or a group outing . The Cuban carnitas sandwich is to die for with the garlic fries . The applewood pulled bbq pork sandwich is moist and the slaw adds the much needed texture to elevate the sandwich we thoroughly enjoyed the environment and food selection !"}
{"text":"First time trying this spot. First off, the staff was very welcoming and sat us down right away. Place is huge with a wide selection of foods to choose from.  We started with the \"crispy\" Brussel sprouts and a small beer. When it came out, the Brussels sprouts had no crisp to it whatsoever, but atleast the taste was still pretty good. Also, my beer took almost 15 min to come out when the place was not really busy and they gave me the wrong size. I also ordered the truffle Swiss burger which was really good, but you got to eat it quick because the bread gets soggy quick. My gf order the smothered burrito with adobo chicken and it was very flavorful. The tortilla that's used for it is very thick which I didn't like too much. At the end of the order, the credit card machine was down so I had to pay cash. Luckily I had cash that day. I understand they have been opened for only 2 weeks now but still got a few kinks to fix. I'd still come back but probably try something different."}
{"text":"Love this place!! This is a \"must\" on my list when we come to Vegas now. I get the Cuban sandwich every time and I am never disappointed! Husband had the tacos and liked them as well. Can't wait for the next visit!"}
{"text":"We got calamari and beer. The calamari tasted old, cold, chewy, and fishy. The destination is great with amazing views and service was good. Just not sure how good the food really is..."}
{"text":"After being contacted by the manager, I'm adding two stars because they addressed the issue (hostess) with me, but more importantly with her. Thank you! We will try Tom's Urban again (for the first time past the front door) next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a decent place, if you're at NY NY and need a meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, though. Had the potstickers as an app, and I had the pickle brined chicken with garlic fries, and my fiancé had the Korean bbq lollipops. Her meal was definitely the best, but mine was basically a chicken strip dinner. Where it was listed as one of Toms \"faves\", I was expecting something a little more interesting."}
{"text":"I rarely write negative reviews..but man, this place is so awful that I feel like I owe it to all of you to share.  First, everyone that works here looked miserable and moved like molasses. They were not nice or friendly to guests.  The food was awful. The vegetables were swimming in grease. There was hair not in one but two of our dishes. Once we saw the hair, we just stopped eating and asked for the check. We did not bring it to our server's attention because his service was so bad, we knew there was not much he would do about it and we just did not want to deal with him."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner on a Friday. The service was very good. The food was disappointing. I ordered a dinner salad with steak and requested the steak be cooked medium. It came out well done, not even a speck of pink inside. It came pre seasoned with cracked peppercorns and there were far too many of them  so that they overpowered all the other flavors. My daughter ordered a dinner salad with chicken and said it was very lacking in flavor. A friend that moved to Vegas a year ago was with us, ordered the bacon avocado burger, and said that it was the least favorite burger he's had since living in Vegas."}
{"text":"My buddies and I were in Vegas and we decided to walk across the street from the MGM over to New York, New York for dinner.  We saw the 4 stars on Yelp and decided to make the trek.  We decided to sit outside on a beautiful night and they have a cool bar out there and lots of TVs. I ordered a beer (Pizza Port IPA) and the Cuban. I have had much better Cubans. Hardly any mustard, I couldn't even tell if there was pickle in there, it was very three star.  I tried a few of my friend's chicken tenders and fried brussel sprouts though and they were fantastic!  The kale salad was nothing special, but good.  Our service was slow, but I got a free beer because they brought the wrong one that I ordered though, so that was cool of them.  Great setting, but no way a 4 star place for my experience.  I got 2 beers and my meal and after tip it was about $40.  Great company though, so it was a fun dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the game, have some beers and apps. Had pizza, fries and the ghost pepper wings. If you like spicy then the ghost wings were amazing! I would order that again but be prepared, it's spicy! The pizza was good as well but the fries was nothing special. I was surprised at how pricey the beers were and therefore gave it three stars instead of four."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was good!  Tasty. Great atmosphere but there is no excuse for the wait to get the food.  Restaurant was empty waited 50 minutes for food.  No one offered refills.  Of you are not hungry yet or need anything to quench your thirst this is the place for you"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic atmosphere!! Outside seating  is so awesome when it's not too hot and bottomless mimosas for $20! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from my server Rosa! Food was delishes! No complaints ...def coming back when I return to vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight and Eddie is by far one of the best servers in Vegas. Highly recommend him to anybody trying to come in and eat. Great food and beer for any occasion."}
{"text":"The food & server was awesome. I had a burger & it was awesome. The prime rib slider was good too. My wife liked the jalapeño popper sandwich & she loved it. The severs were good even with my kids running around so that was pretty cool not too many kid friendly place"}
{"text":"Omg!! The place maybe be on the Strip but place is good! They have our door seating and indoor seating and it at New York New York , place was great and the sever were nice and place had a bar and u can see people walking by she. U get the outdoor seating and music is loud but its only outdoor and I had the pizza and husband had burger and frys and it was good too so we finish are food and we do t mind coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great. 3 meals in a week.  Food is unique, well done, and they are not trying to be too cute. Staff is effective and friendly.  Stop by you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Toms does great with their service and accommodations. However, their food is not very flavorful- those of us who had any egg dish found it bland. The French toast and pancakes seemed like the best options from our group."}
{"text":"Prime rib sliders were excellent. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The food and service is great!"}
{"text":"5 stars!   I actually ate here TWICE in one weekend. It was convenient because it was at the hotel (New York New York) but it's also really damn good food and drinks. As a plus - it was a cheaper option than other restaurants!   Things I loved and highly recommend:  + Their version of a Moscow Mule + FROG LEGS (...I'm so serious) + Sliders + Attentive Service + Fish tacos + Boneless pickled chicken tenders (easily shareable!)  Things that I could have passed up:  - Their Garlic and Parmesan fries. Try the tater tots instead maybe?  - Hummus Dip  These two options weren't bad necessarily but paled in comparison to the others.  Highly recommend!    Pro Tip: If the weather permits, definitely get a table outside and enjoy your food and drinks while Vegas people watching!    xo"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a snack or a meal. Micheal was very helpful and a great server. Food was on point and a great place to people watch on the strip. Great happy hour from 4-7 during the week."}
{"text":"Adam and Allison were awesome! Service and conversation were outstanding. Came out with my brother for his pre wedding celebration helped us pick out the perfect beer. Gave us plenty of tastes and hooked my brother up with a wedding shot. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great late night specials. Right on the strip with a good outdoor atmosphere. The staff was super friendly - loved our waiter...he even gave us to-go beers! :-)"}
{"text":"Great spot inside at the bar gives access to the sports book.  The bloody marys that Victoria made were an excellent hangover cure and were a great to sip away while watching the breeders cup.  Bottomless mimosas were also taken full advantage of ! $19 for 3 hours !"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: great service but sub-standard food.  Service was spot on. We were immediately seated and attended to. We ordered their crispy Brussel Sprouts as our appetizer. Sprouts had a nice flavor to them (on the sweet side) but in my opinion, should have been served in smaller chunks to give them an even crispier bite. For the entrees: we had the following:  1. Crispy chicken served with French Fries and grits. Chicken was delicious and perfectly crispy. The grits on the other hand was way too dry. My husband had a spoonful and left the rest untouched. 2. Seafood Mac and Cheese. Also very dry. Such a shame since I hardly order Mac and Cheese. I decided to treat myself and left disappointed. I ended picking the shrimp and lobster and like the grits, left the rest untouched.  I think this pretty much sums it up. With so many other restaurants to pick from, we ended in one where we left disappointed. As the saying goes: win some, lose some."}
{"text":"I went to Tom Urban based on the reviews on Yelp. I took 4 friends with me. Sadly the event was very below par for 4 of 5 meals. It took 30 minutes to get served after sitting at a partially empty bar. Two friends ordered burritos which came out cold and were made incorrectly. The other two friends order pan cakes that were also cold. We spent a total of 1 1/2 hours of our life that we can't get back. They should have paid us. Enough said and I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like the cozy feel Tom's Urban offers on such a busy thoroughfare, the Las Vegas Boulevard strip.  Our server, Michele, was so sweet and attentive!  Despite a packed restaurant, Michele made sure we wanted for nothing.  She was also kind enough to give us tips on places we should visit according to our likes.  we loved everything she suggested.  I ordered the chicken taco dish.  You get three tacos full of meat.  The food needed a little extra seasoning, but tasted great after a small dash of salt.  While the food was pretty good, I truly gave Tom's four stars because the service was impeccable.  What I appreciated second to the great service was the fact the food came out extremely fast.  Be sure to ask how each dish is prepared, as the dishes don't come out the way you would expect them to look.  For example, the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip has very, very thick slices of medium rare beef, and the Boulder Colorado Club is served open-faced in an oblong baking dish - it looks more like a bowl of lasagna.  With all the options in Las Vegas, Tom's Urban is worth a try."}
{"text":"Horrible service... Hostess at the front was on her phone as we waited for her to realize we were even there... Then server didn't come back even once between giving us our drinks and giving us the bill... Completely ignored us multiple times... Didn't expect it to be this bad with other reviews complimenting the service"}
{"text":"We had a blast at Tom's thanks to Eric our waiter. He went so far out of his way to make sure we had a flawless night.   Good food, great drinks and Eric's service made this a night to remember."}
{"text":"I like the cool decorations and open air seating to the strip. They also have a very intriguing cocktail menu. I was somewhat disappointed though, when we ordered 2 different tequila drinks to find out that the stated tequila on the menu was not used. I ordered the drink with Hornitos because that's my favorite tequila. I was disappointed when finding out from the bartender that a different tequila was used in my drink."}
{"text":"The place is really nice and calm after an afternoon on the Strip. We had the avacado shrimp salad and the calamari, both were delicious with portions big enough for two. The not-your-father's rootbeer float is epic, and new to the menu according to our server.  The drinks list is extensive, and the cocktails are great. I recommend getting the 32oz souvenir shaker!"}
{"text":"A group of friends ate here on a Saturday night after a show at T-Mobile arena. It was a quick walk and we were seated immediately. The service was fast and friendly and our food was delicious. We tried the frog legs (a little spicy), lobster mac and cheese (highly recommended), the shrimp and grits (spicy), and the fig & brie sandwhich with sweet potato fries. It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent pork belly bahn mi tacos! Went with a party of 4 and everyone enjoyed the taste of their meals.  The duck wings are definitely worth a try as well.  The only drawbacks were that the presentation and plating was sloppy.  Also avoid the skillet corn it tastes nothing like real grilled Mexican street corn.  Service was friendly and fast.  Good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio with a party of 3.  The weather was perfect and the patio cover provided just the right amount of shade for comfortable outdoor eating.   Good was incredible.  I enjoyed the Philly cheese steak which was incredible.  We also had the lobster sandwich which was rich with flavor.  Nathan was our server - very attentive and friendly and we ordered off of his suggestions and weren't disappointed.  Will definitely come back for multiple reasons bit mostly because of the quality of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"The food was just ok, not worth money.  The service was horrible. They messed up my kids order twice.  When I say no sauce on potsticker, I really do mean no sauce on my potsticker.  The food took forever. The server cried because she only received a 12% tip.  I may never visit New York New York hotel because of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best prime rib sandwich I've had.  Highly recommended along with the grits.  The drinks are pretty pricey.  $23 for a 22oz bloody Mary is kinda crazy.  Beer on the strip is always expensive especially when you like craft beer. I think it was $14 for a 22oz Lagunitas IPA.  But the food was excellent."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place!  We came in at lunchtime on a Friday and were seated right away.  Excellent seats good for people watching on the strip.   The waitress was very friendly and helpful with our  menu questions.  She did forget to bring out half our drinks but brought them quickly once we mentioned it and we noticed she did not charge us for any of our drinks which I thought was classy that we didn't even have to ask for that concession. (It was just sodas and teas etc, nothing alcoholic)   It took us forever to order because we all wanted to try everything on the menu. We finally decided and the food came out quickly and was delicious.   We all agreed it was our favorite meal during our short trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sitting here, at the bar, 15 minutes later, no service. Not even a look. Or a menu. Vegas service at its finest.  20 minutes."}
{"text":"Could not be happier when I realized the old Zone had become this super cool strip side hot spot. The patio is a great place to waste a couple hours drinking and people watching. Lots of TVs to watch the games that you can bet on in the sports book that's a quick second out the casino floor entrance. Service was outstanding and the management was on top of it. Really genuine care and passion for our overall experience.  I'll be in Vegas for 5 days and can't wait to come back. I think I found my new home away from home while on my trip. Thanks Toms!"}
{"text":"Best place we ate and drank on the strip, hands down!  Try the mac and cheese pot as an appetizer, you won't be disappointed. Also, be sure to ask to be seated in Amberly's section, she is the best waitress ever!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Seriously never go here for Super Bowl.  Or ever. It is a poorly run restaurant. Trust me. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Every time I visit the Las Vegas Strip, I have to stop at Tom's Urban. The food is fresh, the staff are friendly, and the ambiance is super inviting.  I'm not normally into spicy food, but I fell in love with their ginger potstickers and I keep coming back for more. It's the perfect small plate that will fill your belly and put the right amount of spice on your tongue.   Pair it with a side order of sweet potato fries and you have the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Manga!"}
{"text":"This location knows that you are just visiting and there is no need for good service. We stoped by one day last April and had Joseph as our server. The service was as bad as the food. We complained about he food and that the beer was severed in a hot glass making it a warm glass. The manager stoped by looked at the food and said it looked good and felt my beer glass and said it was cold enough. I would suggest you pass this place by.  Tom"}
{"text":"Last night a friend and I grabbed dinner here and it was absolutely amazing. Great food, service, and just overall an amazing atmosphere. Ashley was our server and gave us more than everything we needed. Definitely will be back. You are awesome, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Eddie is the best, come and get the tots. Totally worth it. Especially if Eddie is your server"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, priced high. Service was absolutely wretched. I'm not sure who tied our waitresses shoes but I'm certain it was not her."}
{"text":"I won't eat here again. I was seated at a table with food  on the chairs. When asked if it could be cleaned, no one ever came so I ended up cleaning it myself. All of the silverware that was place on our table was  dirty, with visible food particles. The salt shaker was broken, and there was no soap in the bathroom. I will admit that the food was good, but not worth another visit."}
{"text":"What a great place on the strip! Perfect patio strip side seating at NY NY! Great food & great view! The cornbread pancake was amazing! Thanks Toms! Please open another LA location!"}
{"text":"Not the best experience. Server got my order wrong and the boyfriends philly cheese steak is horrible. Came here cuz I thought it would be a good place to stop, but VERY sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat for over 20 min with no drink order. Table next to us was waiting over 30 min. We got up and left and went  to the Burger Bar. Had drink order within one minute of seating. Tom's urban needs more help."}
{"text":"The ghost pepper wings were perfectly sweet and spicy, the beer was cold and the service was friendly and accommodating. The garlic parsley fries were crispy and tasty.   Perfect spot for a mid afternoon snack under the misters on the strip. The rest of the menu looks interesting with quite a variety of choices, will try again."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is a great place to eat, drink, and be merry! The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are great. A special shout out to Angelo today. He is the best bar tender in Las Vegas! Stop by the patio to meet him. He made our stop really fun!"}
{"text":"Went to Monte Carlo for 800 Degrees at 10pm, only to find out that 800 degrees now closes at 10 instead of 11. Great. Looked up nearby places and chose Tom's Urban because of the 4 star review and 2 dollar signs. I disagree with both those evaluations. $18 for nachos with flimsy salty chips and hardly any cheese or meat and just bad quality ingredients overall. Server was very kind and had the nachos taken off the bill. Even so, paid $60 for 2 beers, 1 cocktail, and 2 items off the small plates menu (fries two ways and brussel sprouts) which were just okay and overpriced. My boyfriend felt sick immediately after eating here. Staff were the only highlight of this restaurant and were all friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"With all the rave reviews, I definitely expected better, Tom! Anyway yelpers, here's what you shouldn't order:   The fish in the fish taco was the driest I've literally ever had and although the slaw was tasty, I really should have thought better about ordering fish in the desert. Queso fundido appetizer came out with our entrées in the teeniest, tinyest dish with like one slice of melted cheese. That'd be fine had it been free but for $10+, it was absolutely absurd. Shrimp po boy sliders were okay in flavor (remoulade was on point!) but these were also quite dry thanks to the heavy-handed cornmeal breading.   The Bloody Mary was well balanced despite being a touch too salty for our taste. The location is great, the patio seating was lovely and the table next to us ordered breakfast which looked pretty good. I would possibly go back to try their breakfast offerings and/or sip drinks and people watch at the patio bar but definitely not for another lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"After someone from the Tom's Urban team reached out to me, I spoke with the VP of Operations regarding my experience and was delighted with the level of customer service he provided. They seem genuinely concerned with their customers' experiences and I value that a lot in a business. He offered me a free meal in the Downtown Los Angeles location (where I live) to make up for my mediocre initial visit.  Thank you so much Doug, and the Tom's Urban team! I'm excited to review the DTLA location! It's awesome to know that they take feedback so genuinely."}
{"text":"A little pricy but big portions and tasty food so it is worth it. The drinks seem very expensive but they taste great. We had the breakfast burrito (it's \"the best eggs I've ever had\" said my husband) with the 2 shot Bacon Infused Bourbon Bloody Mary and Huevos Benedicto with bottomless mimosa.  We'd definitely eat here again.  Our waitress Cheryl was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. We have kids and they have kids menu too. They are in the las vegas st front of new york hotel. Very nice clean and attractive motiff. Recommended. Ginger pot stickers are little spicy but refreshing."}
{"text":"Had some really good food, but the difference maker here was the open atmosphere and the service.  This was a perfect spot for MNF, and our bar tender, Steven, provided great service, and great conversation.  He made us feel quite welcome despite being a knights fan (Go Kings Go).  In the words of Ice Cube, \"It was a good day.\" Thanks to Steven and Toms Urban"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for a parents and team dinner...first off we made a reservation for a party of 40 people and they acted like we were a party of 2 people trying to check in. It started with when we called to check in for our reservations and they acted totally weird and asked why didn't we go through events management? Seriously why didn't you ask this 2 months ago when we made the reservations? Then when we showed up they wanted to split up our party even though the restaurant was totally dead. Even more disappointing was the management team didn't even come over to even deal with it. But to be honest our waitress Ashley B and Jose did an outstanding job getting us all in one area and taking care of us...for me they made up for all the shortcomings!   The food fell a little short in my opinion and was just ok...and pretty expensive for what you get for 4 people and 2 beers was $110 and one daughter got fries for dinner? Beers are $8.50 a piece as much as a meal!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool restaurant right on the corner of NY NY hotel.  They have an outdoor area but with 115 degree weather (no thank you)  I sat inside with a couple of friends for apps and drinks, the server was nice and very patience with my party that grew from 6ppl to 8ppl to 12ppl  Overall... good ambiance, good food, good service, that's all you need"}
{"text":"After a long turn up night in Vegas we were looking for variety menu to please our bunch, with a good vibe and more drinks..FOUND IT!!!  The Gin and Juice was amazing and everyone's drinks were delicious.  All the food was great, service great will def be back."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend for an impromptu casual dinner. The outdoor seating area and cool decor appealed to us, as did the rather varied menu.   Liked: the terrace decor with its high tables, colorful lanterns, elaborate bar with cobalt, turquoise and pink hanging bottles. Plus the view of the Vegas strip without all the noise - a nice compromise between feeling the Vegas vibe but getting a bit of peace too. It was a fresh, welcome change from stuffy and formal hotel restaurants. Also liked the fact that they did not shy away from using condiments and spices in the food: both our dishes had a nice kick to them. The soft drinks were refilled for free which was a nice surprise. Our waitress was well-informed and efficient.   Disliked/ could have been better: the food albeit tasty lacked that wow factor. My chicken tacos were not served as piping hot as I would have liked them to be (which i.a. made them look a bit trite) and the chicken carried a little too much fatty skin (I found myself examining each piece and cleaning it up before eating it). The leaves in my boyfriend's salad looked a little tired and weren't as crunchy and fresh as they could have been. My rhum and ginger beer/ lemon drink tasted ok but I would have expected the ginger beer to make it extra fizzy - instead it was kind of flat.  Overall, an ok dining experience - if I went back I'd try other dishes to get a better idea of the restaurant's true pedigree."}
{"text":"Late dinner after picking up the girl from work. Not too many options after 11:30pm, so we ended up here. The inside dining area has round booths that can probably accomodate about 8 people. Service was fast and friendly and we got our drink order pretty quickly.   I ordered the Filet Mignon Steak & Eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), and had a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Unfortunately, that was the only part of the meal that I liked. I specified over-medium for the eggs, but they came out looking fried - no chance of getting any runny yoke here. The hash browns were a bit tough. As though it were cooked by three different people. Too bad. Those things ruined an otherwise tasty dish.  My girl had the Truffled Maine Lobster Roll, which is basically a lobster sandwich. The sandwich was good - lobster tasted fresh. It would have would have been nice if they included a lemon wedge with it, so that you can squeeze it over the lobster. Also, toasting the outside would have given the texture of the sandwich a little more contrast. I didn't see if that option was on the menu, but I would ask for this if I were to order this sandwich again.  Overall, this experience was kind of meh, but I'd be willing to give this place another shot - maybe."}
{"text":"Jack of All Trades, Master of None  The service at shift change was actually rude. However, they made up for it by doing absolutely nothing. They were not busy enough to warrant that level of inattention. \"Are you gonna want more iced tea.\" as she walked off. It wasn't a question; it was a statement.   Time from seating to getting a menu - nine minutes. We were there in plenty of time to order brunch. However, this was denied since the service was pathetically slow. It was a solid 22 minutes before we received our beverages.   ...and OMG, I'm such an asshole for expecting to use the Yelp check in! No, you CANNOT TAKE MY UNLOCKED PHONE TO YOUR MANAGER! I know you're a waitress and not an IT Security Specialist, but it's not MY job to know what flipping Yelp deals your business is running.   My Pickle Brined Nashville Hot Chicken was OK. It should be about $8 cheaper. The serving size of the $6 Fried Pickles was ridiculous. (Of course, perhaps this was the Yelp Special Size.) $18 for three average tacos?  Yup.   MGM, if you're going to charge this much for this food, at least make sure the service is exceptionally good and not \"marginally there\".   Overall, an extremely poor, yet expensive experience."}
{"text":"Good breakfast for Paleo peeps! Avocado, bacon & cheddar omelette. Healthy portion of avocados. Kale salad w/olive oil! Subbed fruit for carbs w/no charge. Waitress Tina offered sub. Thank u. Would recommend & come back"}
{"text":"A big no.  Walked in with the family around 7:30 this past Thursday.  Menu looked real nice but we were not wowed with any of our food.  Prices as high, as expected on the Vegas Strip, but that could be overlooked if the food is outstanding or at least good.  I ordered the chopped salad.  Wanted it without bacon and ham (also has chicken) and was told they could not leave the ham out.  Weird, but I said okay - figured I could pick it out.  Chicken in the salad was nit grilled as stated and was very salty and processed tasting.  I am sure it was some kind of packaged pre-cooked chicken which I really hate.  I also felt that my salad was missing some other ingredients so I checked on-line later that night and I was right.  They left out the romaine, baby kale and goat cheese.  I did not ask to have these items omitted.  The other entrees were pretty lackluster but I think they contained everything they were supposed to.  We all agreed that we would not return here."}
{"text":"I have consistent issues with the drinks here -- tonight I ordered a gimlet in a very specific way, (on the rocks, how many parts liquor versus juice, and not shaken or stirred). I did this to make sure that I would be disappointed with the drink.  The drink I got had no ice, the wrong mix, and was shaken. I let the waiter know that the drink wasnt as I ordered (as I was very specific), it didn't even have ice, and the waiter started arguing with me about how I didn't really wasnt a gimlet and how what I ordered was not a real drink.  I could not have been more specific with what I was asking for and the waiter said he understood and repeated it back to me only to deliver something completely different and then argue with me."}
{"text":"My husband and 2 kids ate there when we arrived at the hotel because we were starving.  The food was really really good and the service was excellent.  Our waiter was awesome and so friendly.  I like waiters that will visit!"}
{"text":"Best omelettes ever at Toms! Nate and Lina rocked it and made our breakfast even that much better. Don't miss this place for a late breakfast on the strip."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! The service is great, April is amazing!!  Duck wings... Yummy!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and it was the best omlette I ever had... It was amazing and they gave you big portions.. the outside seating was really nice too. Would definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Found a hair in my macaroni and cheese. Ordered drinks during happy hour that were on my bill for full price. After telling my waitress, she brought a corrected ticket but then charged my card for the full (incorrect) amount. Check your receipts!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The service sucks, both slow and unpleasant. We both tried different burgers (mine had bacon and avocado on it), and we both agreed that our burgers were worse than what you get at fast foot restaurants. I ordered my burger medium but it came well done. The bun was soggy and the bacon wasn't crisp. My fries tasted stale and were probably re-fried. The best part about my burger was the avocado which they just cut up and the ketchup which had a nice kick to it but they probably just got that out of a bottle.  We both wish we had just gone to the Shake Shack next door."}
{"text":"We walk by this place all the time and finally decided to try it this morning for breakfast.  It's fabulous because the whole menu is available all day.  We got here at 9am and saw a girl eating a burger and fries.  Love it!  We got the chicken cornbread pancake and the fig grilled cheese.  Both were amazing.  We could've shared either.  Big portions.    I would suggest putting sliced pears in the grilled cheese.   I like that there were options for the side rather than just plain fries.    Service was decent.  I did have to ask for water refills and the aioli for my tater tots but it was a fun experience.   Oh and the music was rap and loud for 9am on a Monday morning.  Would've preferred different music. We weren't at a night club.    We will be back!! Want to try some other things."}
{"text":"Haven't been this satisfied at a restaurant in a long time.   I had the bacon avocado & cheese omelet with the grits and it was awesome.   I will definitely come back to this place again"}
{"text":"Top notch service. And wonderful food. I love coming here whenever I'm at New York-New York. Hits the stop just before an epic concert!"}
{"text":"If you are headed to a Golden Knights game and you want to chow down before hand, stop here for a great selection of foods and spirits.  Prompt, friendly service and a delicious reasonable priced meal for 3 of us including multiple apps and some drinks along w entrees.  Our waitress Tiffany was awesome and Erin wants to be friends with her.  Overwhelmingly pleasing experience."}
{"text":"Had an unfortunate experience late last night and will not be back. Took forever for wait staff to tear themselves away from chatting with bartender. Had to return prime rib sliders as they were fatty and unappetizing. Had to request napkins. Way over-priced and poorly run."}
{"text":"Food was ok. 5 star for awesome service by Kyle. Made our brunch very enjoyable. Will definitly return."}
{"text":"Very convenient location near the Park in Las Vegas. Entry from outside or from inside New York New York. Has indoor and outdoor area. But it's Crazy Expensive $61 for 2 draft beers and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Our First time here! We saw this place from the strip and Yelp had some pretty good reviews for it! A bit pricey but I must admit the food was very good!! I have a small appetite but love good food and the food here hit the spot. I ordered the prime rib PhillyCheese Steak Sandwich!  amazing! Worth All $23 amazing! My husband had the Bbq Bacon jalapeño burger, our daughter had the Bacon avocado burger and they loved their food as well! Rosa was waitress and she was nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  I visited this place twice while in Vegas.  I would have eaten here everyday of my 4 day visit but didn't think it was cool to do that to my companion. The Al.Carbon steak in any of.it's dishes are worth trying.  I had there steak nachos and Green Chili Smother Burrito.  Freakin awesome."}
{"text":"Today was a complete failure with service and attention. This was our 4th time and prior to today has always been acceptable, service has declined since its opening. We like the dynamic menu and convenience of the location. Our server was nice, however the food came in unsatisfactory. Presentation was awful, my our orders came in different times and we had to wait for missing side dishes. It was frustrating, the person delivering our food was giving us someone else's order and looked confused. I have never experienced this before in this location. I will NOT come back again, since it is a little pricey I expected better food, great service and prompt attention. Our receipt had this info 8/27 Check#15133276 table 375, making that we were an actual customer that dined in today. If could ask for a refund I would, but I can barely get server to assist us and just wanted to leave.I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"We had their breakfast menu . Quick to seat us, service was great even though it was 1 waitress for the entire inside portion of the restaurant. We order orange juice which is freshly squeezed, Classic Eggs Benedict and a Sausage Burrito. All very tasty portioned well. Prices not bad for breakfast on the strip."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable brunch place right on the strip!!   Thanks to the suggestion of our waiter, the BF and I decided to share an omelet. The omelets are huge so I'm really glad that we did! We ordered a make your own with avocado, bacon and goat cheese. They accidentally used cheddar instead of goat cheese, but provided us with a side of goat.   We also ordered a side of garlic fries. Yum! You can never go wrong with fries. Those two items were definitely enough to fill us up! The meal cost about $20 in total. Great price, especially for the quality and quantity of the food.   The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that the service was really slow. We didn't see our waiter for the majority of our visit. It took a really long time for a water refill or to even see anyone to ask about getting some of the goat cheese. I noticed the restaurant had a lot of empty tables but there was still a wait when we first got there so I'm assuming they were understaffed.   Even with the slow service, it was definitely a great brunch place and somewhere I'd like to come back to on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were all good.  Sat outside with the heaters on since we're from Michigan, and wanted to soak up fresh air in January.  Very cool vibe inside, the size is deceiving, its pretty big in there.  Had a bunch of different appetizers, calamari was pretty salty and when the waitress asked why we didn't eat much, we told her so.  She offered to make us a new one but we were ok with not...she insisted anyway but came back that they use Zatarains mix so they can't control the salt.  Lots of TV's to catch a game which always helps.  Would definitely go back since I usually stay at NY NY for business."}
{"text":"Met some work people here for lunch.  The restaurant here at NY NY is nice and big compared to others at the casino.  We had pretty good service and the food was good. I had the fried chicken with corn bread waffles.  This was ok, but no way near what you can get next door with their fried chicken waffle choices.  This is a good place with plenty of choices with reasonable prices for Vegas strip.   And it opens pretty late.  Good late night option for sure."}
{"text":"This place had amazing tacos and lobster and shrimp mac & cheese. It's not crazy expensive compared to other places on the strip, but it was open late enough for us to slide in and grab food.  We got seated right away the place wasn't busy. The only real complaints I have is they have tables right next to each other so it's super easy to eavesdrop on others weird conversations. It was uncomfortable having a conversation or even hearing the tables around you bickering. Especially if you're not busy spread us out.  The server was fast and friendly it was perfect for a late late late dinner."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Our waiter helped us decide what to get. We got the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and the BLT sandwich with eggs and cheese and mayo. Everything was really good!"}
{"text":"Great food, a ton of options, host was great, service was just okay. The shrimp and grits was spicy, but nothing compared to the spicy fried chicken and cornbread pancake. Oddly enough, the syrup cut the spice nicely and it was still edible, even with the burning mouth. TVs all around to satisfy the sports fans."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Tom's Urban the other night while we were visiting from Orlando for the New Years I have to say the host are amazing (she actually talked me into eating there) I was actually trying to stumble into another place. But I have to the food was amazing also my friend had the taco's and I had the prime rib sliders not only was the food and service amazing from host, server, to even the manager Aaron he is a sexy and sweet guy who is great with customer service.. I would recommend this place to eat to anyone.. so in my book they get \"two thumbs up\" check them out when your in town. We will back to Vegas in June sometime hope to visit again. -WM"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The decor was nice, so thought we'd give it a chance. Im so glad we did. I got the classic eggs benidect and it was wonderful. Our waiter was a delight as well. If you get a chance I'd definitely give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Delicious food but the bar staff was very slow. 2 bartenders with 13 guests at the bar. AND the bar top sat filthy the whole time. The experience would had been better if the bar was wiped down. I had to use beverage napkins to push leftover food away and she used the same napkin to try and pick up the  food but never wiped away the sauce and remaining food. AND yes we moved seats....the bar was still dirty. I went to the bathroom to wet towels and came back out to wipe our area. Gross"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was nice. The food is REALLY pricey and ok. Not sure if it was a new cook but the presentation was sloppy. The food seemed to be good then you taste it and it tasted like they needed to put in just a tad more effort. We ordered the pork belly bahn mi tacos and the toppings appeared to be a bit old, as it was sitting under the heat lamp too long. My daughter ordered ginger chicken pot stickers and they were soggy and greasy... not crispy and there was a pile of scallions and lettuce over it. Lol The pizza my son ordered was good  second time around cause the cook burnt the first order. Lol We did find an beer we really enjoyed. Small servings. Wouldn't go."}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing. The food was gross and there was a hair in our food, everything is overpriced, the bottomless mimosas are a waste of money because you never get a refill, our whole party couldn't sit together after waiting 2 hours for a table, our pancakes were undercooked and took an additional 30 minutes for a new plate and the new pancake was still undercooked, the server got someone's order wrong and that took an hour to receive the right plate, service is so slow, the hostess was unbelievably rude and had serious attitude when we complained about waiting so long, the management only gave us the meal with the hair in it for free but still made us pay for gross food and bottomless mimosas we didn't get. We've spent a total of 4 hours here and are still waiting to pay our food that we shouldn't be. Just terrible. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"We are from Orlando and looking for places to go. Sam our waitress was fantastic and made the experience that much better. From the drinks to the food she really nailed it. Good food cheap drinks and incredible"}
{"text":"During a girls weekend in Vegas, we enjoyed not one, not two, but three fantastic visits to Tom's Urban. It was a great place to sit outside and people watch while enjoying delicious food (potstickers and bleu chicken sliders were fantastic).  We liked it so much we decided to return the next day for breakfast (fresh mushrooms in the omelettes - YUM!!). Then we simply couldn't resist returning for a late afternoon Urban Spike Milkshake. Our waiter Nate told us to go w the Bacardi Coconut Chocolate, and he didn't steer us wrong. And Spencer was the man that made the milkshake magic!  Our only regret is not requesting an extra shot of rum. Everyone from the hostess to the bartender was great."}
{"text":"Super Big portions, great service, awesome food!!! Make sure to ask how bigs are the portions of you have kids, the pancakes were way too big for my 9 yrs old kid to eat."}
{"text":"We met Caesar, our waiter, he was just fantastic!  He knows his menu, customer care and anticipated just about any question or request we had!  A definite must our next visit!"}
{"text":"Service:  We went to the patio side and asked to seat 3 people. They seated us, but the seats outdoors are really dirty. Understood that it is outdoor seatings, but staffs should really take care of their furnitures. The only time we got service was when we were ordering and asking for the check/bill. After ordering and receiving our food/drinks, no one else came by to check on us or refilled our water. When we asked for the bill, it took about 10 minutes for them to bring it. Then, we asked for the tea to-go and that took them another 5 minutes. It honestly doesn't take that long to get a check and a drink.   Food:  Despite the service, the food was amazing. They have vegetarian and vegan options which is a huge plus for my family. The food was cooked to perfection and the portions was a decent size. One of my family member got the Eggs Benedict and I got the homemade pop tart. My family said the eggs were delicious and were cooked perfectly. My pop tart was utterly sweet, but delicious. For all the sweet tooth people out there, this is a must try."}
{"text":"I came in for bottomless mimosas and a quick breakfast and Megan changed my life! She's just an amazing server, funny, kind, and tried to actually connect with us! She was so great! I'm only visiting, but when I come back, I would definitely ask for her again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really hate leaving a bad review for this place but the service here is not acceptable. From the moment that we stepped inside, I started getting worried.  The hostess took my information to see about a table and then came back 20 minutes later and asked me \"did you put your name down already?\".  Apparently she forgot about our group... Our waitress was running around the place like a chicken with her head cut off so I am not sure if she was overworked or if waiting tables is not her thing.  It took at least 20 minutes to get 1 beer and 1 moscow mule and another 30 to get our food.  The dishes came out in different orders so the birthday boy started his burger while the rest of us were already licking our plates.  We were going to order dessert (as we were celebrating a birthday) but I was afraid that I might have to sit there for another hour.  The food is good and the vibe is cool but the service is not on par."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Good service and reasonable prices. I ordered their homemade poptart. They have daily flavors. I tried their cherry one and it was the right amount of sweet. They have good coffee too, only whole milk though."}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonably priced. Had the pork belly tacos, Mexican corn, cheese fog jam sandwich with bacon and lemon tots. Nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"we come here every vegas trip because everything is always delicious. they've updated their menu since we were last out - decided to try the Nashville Kickin Chicken Skillet (grits, cheese, nashville hot chicken) - ridiculously good. like definitely going into the order rotation! drinks were strong and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Mimosas are amazing! I got the breakfast burrito and my husband got the blueberry pancakes, both of us are big eaters and we couldn't finish. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place another try. Dough had contacted me and apologized for the bad service I had in Las Vegas. The restaurant in Los Angeles is beautiful. It really big and spacious. We had made reservations at 11pm but we arrived an hour early. When we arrived there wasn't anyone one in the front. We waited about 5 mins and the hostess helped us. She was really nice and she took us to our table. Our waitress Evelyn came and asked for our drinks. I asked for a lemonade and my husband a blue moon beer (40oz). She was really nice and gave excellent service. We decided to order Adobe chicken tacos, pizza, lobster Mac and cheese. We also ordered dessert, cheese cake! Everything was really good, beyond delicious. The chicken tacos are so perfect you can either order them with flour or corn tortillas. The lobster Mac and cheese was delicious with great favors. When we were a lot done eating the restaurant manager was also helping us. I didn't get his name but he was really nice to us. Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban had some of the best options for food on the strip. We had the lobster Mac and cheese, and the ginger potsticker salad. Both were fresh and delicious! Our waitress, Paige, was very friendly and helpful, and made the meal very enjoyable. The meal was delicious and next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Alright. Let me step on my soap box. This place isn't worthy of your time or money. Let me tell you why.  But first, I'll tell you the best thing about this place...their sauce for the calamari. Okay. Now back to the crap.   Food was terrible. Ordered a medium done burger, got charred well done. Partner ordered a well done burger got medium rare. Friend got a chicken sandwich, chicken was dry as a bone. Shrimp was slimey and garbage.  Don't waste your money. I know it's convenient being in your hotel, but seriously--I wish I would've walked down the strip more and spent my time at a place that has better service and better food. period."}
{"text":"Went to New York, Ny for a show and stumbled upon Tom's Urban. First of all, check into yelp and enjoy those free fried pickles! It was a Monday night but I made reservations on open table anyway- didn't need to. This place is huge! They have a nice outdoor bar area and good happy hour specials. I ordered a grilled cheese (with fig!) with sweet potato fries and it was delicious! Paired it with their version of a Moscow mule which was very gingery (I love ginger). Very laid back vibes and the wait staff was super attentive."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast after St. Patty's day.  I picked out this breakfast spot for my husband and I.  We both ordered water and a hot beverage.  I asked about the flavor of the URBAN POP TARTS  and she replied Cherry.   I ordered the Urban Pop Tart and the HUEVOS RANCHEROS LOCOS.  My husband ordered the of the HANGOVER SLOPPER, which states in the menu comes with 2 fried eggs.  The server asked how he would like his burger cooked and he replied Medium.   After the food was delivered, we waited for our server to return with silverware.  The fried eggs in the Hangover Burger where Not hard..  Which if my husband knew they where going to be running- he would have requested to cook the eggs hard.  He hates running eggs.  My dish was tasty! The Urban Pastry Pop Tart was actually Apple -not Cherry- and it was very good! I let the server know that it wasn't a big deal, but maybe she didn't know.  She replied with yeah, they mix up flavors.  Overall 3 star rating."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I had the ribs and the sauce was heavy and bold. Average service, they looked a little understaffed but tried their best. I would say this is an average place."}
{"text":"So much fun and awesome deals depending on the hour you come. Tasty brussel sprouts and super fun waiter, Eric!"}
{"text":"A little confused on what this restaurant is focusing their cuisine on but whatever it is, we weren't really happy with their mediocre food.  Service is ok but we've had better on the strip and better food as well.  Not worth coming back."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price. Everything is fresh and always can find a table. I ate here twice on my last visit, once late night and once for lunch. Both meals were really Good for the price. Service was very good as well. One of the few places on the south strip open after midnight."}
{"text":"Was at toms urban today and what can I say. The food was great I had the ghost pepper wings and they were great. What made the place 5 stars though was the excellent customer service. Our waitress Ashley was on point and made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I went there because I kept on seeing the commercial I'm my hotel room. So we  decided to try the duck wings as an appetizers. It was so good. Seasoned and crispy to perfection. I ordered the eggs and steak benidict, which was OK but the grits was one of the best I've ever tasted. My boo had the lobster an shrimp macaroni which was kinda bland. I would go back for the duck wings and grits tho."}
{"text":"This was the first place I came to with my girlfriend and her parents on vacation a couple weeks ago. First glance at the menu was overwhelming -- there were way too many things that sounded delicious. I wound up getting three tacos (Mix-and-Match, as you can see in the picture). If I remember correctly, I got pork (pork belly? Just shredded/carnitas? I don't remember.), lobster and shrimp, and carne asada tacos. I will say that Tom's Urban is definitely on the pricey side, but to get good food in Vegas, you tend to have to spend a lot of money, as made evident here -- the three tacos were about $20 on their own.  Our table also split a side of fries, but I forget the seasoning that was on them. Rosemary garlic or something? I'm not quite sure, but they were very good, especially with the ketchup they had -- I think it was called Moroccan ketchup, or something like that. All three tacos were fantastic, and it's hard to pick a favorite, but I'd probably vote for the seafood ones. My reason for four stars though (other than the price) is that two of the three tacos had to be eaten with a fork because they fell right through the tortillas when they were picked up. My suggestion would be to simply double up the tortillas to prevent (or lessen the chance of) that happening.  The service left a bit to be desired as it was rather slow despite it being I believe 11:30 on a Thursday, but the food was tasty enough to have me give Tom's four stars. I'd likely revisit the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great new place. Perfect example of a great bartender taking the experience up a star. Thanks Tyson for guiding our food and drink selection. Loved the shrimp and grits. Try Toms Pils for an easy to drink beer. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stayed and NY NY this week for CES conference. Found this spot. Menu had a lot going on , made me worried they would offer a lot and it would come out not so good. BUT I WAS WRONG! Loved this place. First night I had the philly and tried the duck wings... so tasty and tender. Shocked was the word.  Next day I had the Bacon Jalepeno burger. I wish I could post a video I took it was like the most juiciest meat ever used in a burger, and not an ounce of grease. I walked over the manager and he was like dude, we own SmashBurger, I was like never tried it, but now if I see it you can bet that I will eat there. I was probably one of the three burgers I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Over all loved the food but the happy hour tacos were misleading. Said we wanted happy hour tacos but when the check back was way more than the menu, were told we were served the regular \"platter\" tacos even though we wanted happy hour and were told we got a better deal if we left it and didn't argue for the happy hour price. How is it happy hour if it is more than the regular menu price?! If we had been clearly informed we would have ordered differently"}
{"text":"Had a great time during our trip to Vegas. Our server, Eddie, was awesome.  Attentive.  Super friendly.   Awesome find.    I had the lobster salad sandwich - which needed a little more lobster and a little less sandwich.  But still really good (and I'm from Massachusetts!).  Beloved ordered the crispy chicken on the cornmeal pancake.  Raved about it for days.    Sangria Was delicious.  Did not expect to be qualified for the birthday deal as both beloved and I both have a \"T\" name.  That was truly an added bonus.  Would've happily paid full price.  Cannot express how much we loved this place and want you to open up on in the actual New York, New York area (like Jersey please!!!)."}
{"text":"One of the best place to have brunch. I found out  that they serve breakfast pretty much all day.  This weekend, this place was  my go to breakfast /brunch.  I had omelettes, eggs benedict,  Colorado calamari,etc..the food and service is very good. This is a chill place with a big bar in the middle which  also have  outside dining tables. The first time I dined here was last year and dined al fresco. It was cold in Vegas this weekend so I stayed indoors.  I like the music videos shown and sports stuff in their televisions.  They serve all kinds of beers from different parts of US ( I think even from other countries). This place is inside NY NY hotel and casino,  so if you are near the area check them out!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Met Aaron, the director of operations. He was extremely friendly and very cool. Jess(?) the bartender was great. She had great recommendations for food and a couple new concoctions for drinks.  This place was right next to sports book so u can bet on games and then watch.  Great location and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Best flavors ever! Would eat the XLR pickle brined  chicken crisps!  Nashville hot if you can stand the heat.  A full pubs of white meat chicken, lightly battered with an awesome sauce.  The Moroccan ketchup is delish and so is the honey mustard.  Will chine back before we leave from our honeymoon! Glad we didn't wait for shake shack to open. And our waiter Bear was super nice too!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this joint and it didn't disappoint! I went with a large group and we shared everything. The duck wings are AMAZING!! You have to try them. I also loved the Brussel sprouts which is not normal for me!! Everything I tried was great, even fries!! I have to say that I will be having the Cuban again sometime soon! We ran into my friends boss and she never remembers my name, so I called myself Tom :-) try this joint while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was as good as expected.  We had a Cuban sandwich with the garlic fries, you actually get 3 section of the sandwich. each section is one whole piece of toast. One of the better Cubans I have had.  The Mac and cheese was one of the best I have had. The carnitas mixed in to it put in over the top.   Our server was excellent, she was very informative and very friendly.  This new addition as part of the renovation to New York New York is a welcomed one"}
{"text":"After a fun-filled night of drinking and shenanigans, it has been my experience that people go for the cheap, heavy and greasy foods to \"revive\" and rally for the next round of debauchery. Call me crazy, but I want a light-ish quality dish to bring me back to life.  Even though I come from the Los Angeles area, I have not had the opportunity to snag a bite at this place before so I was excited to give ol' Tom's a go.   Pros: Upon arriving my guest and I were promptly greeted and seated. We requested to sit outside on the patio despite it being over 100 because of the awesome mist machines they have all over that made it feel like a refreshingly warm day. Not uncomfortable at all. I ordered the tree hugger eggs benedict with the side salad and a classic urban mule (waiter warned against frozen). The food was amazing and very well done. The eggs were poached to perfection and there was just the right amount of hollandaise on the dish. The salad complimented the dish very well and was exactly what I was looking for. Tom's Urban sports a very casual and relaxing vibe after a night of craziness. The staff was very friendly and I had a positive experience overall.  Cons: However, as with most things in life there are a couple things I was not a fan of. After being seated the waiter asked if we would like a bottle of water, as if it was the only option. We said yes to the bottle and were a bit irritated to see that it was $7.00 on the bill. He made no mention of price. We also ordered a homemade poptart to start with (very tasty). Apparently they have different fillings every day and we were not told what the filling of the day was. We ended up liking it, but it is nice to know what you're getting yourself into. In addition, someone else got fresh berries atop theirs, we are not sure if they forgot ours or they requested...the world may never know. Lastly, although the food was very good it was also very expensive. I would come again, but sparingly due to the price."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food!! Our server was excellent, super friendly and down to earth. Portions are huge so me and my husband split the avocado bacon burger with garlic fries.. YUM washed it down with a few bloody Mary's. One of our fave spots to eat overlooking the LV strip!"}
{"text":"I first found this place in Denver and immediately noticed it as I was strolling around Vegas. Tom's Urban's menu has something for everyone and as with the Denver location they don't believe in doing anything small. I ordered the pickle fried chicken and it was just as good as I remembered. I wish I could pack it up and take it home with me as once you experience such a thing you wish you weren't on vacation and your taste buds could live there. The signature drinks were also very tasty and the list is at bit of overwhelming but everyone tried something different at the table and sampled each other's. I also enjoyed the staff as after we finished eating we lingered for a bit and didn't feel rushed. For the pickle fried chicken alone they have five stars. The nice staff was just Icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and good drinks.  If you are in New York New York then this place is a must.  It is not expensive either.  The most amazing thing about it is how quickly you food comes out."}
{"text":"What a great experience, even if it was at midnight! We sat in the back of restaurant at the bar. Our bartender/waitress was awesome! I believe her name was Darlene? The kitchen was going to close in 5 min so we put our order in and she made sure our food would be put in quickly!   I ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes... To die for!!! My fiancé ordered the Big Ass Egg Roll. I can't believe how delicious and freaking big this egg roll was!! The flavors of both dishes were delicious!   The environment was chill for a Sunday night, but I can def see it being extremely busy! Def would go back next time in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Maggie is the most wonderful server. Portions are big. Hint: they usually have ladies out front with BOGO coupons for breakfast Monday to Thursday. Amazing deal!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! The fried chicken fingers were the best fried chicken I've ever had. Ambiance and service is great too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We all work in the industry and we so greatly appreciated our server's knowledge of the menu and exceptional service. Our server Ruth made our lunch such a great experience - all while handling 10 other tables. Definitely a great restaurant on the strip !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Christine-Best waitress I have had in a long time. Fried pickles were sooo delicious. Menu looks fun and can't wait to try carnitas Cuban sandwich and bbq chicken sliders!"}
{"text":"Awful! Very disappointed in this place. Food was less than \"ok\". I ordered a kale Ceaser Salad, thought it would be safe enough to order but Instead I received a plate of ice burg lettuce, 3 leaves of what appeared to be arugula, and no kale. Chicken was old like it was nucked it the microwave. I couldn't even chew it it was very dried out. I was hungry and angry!!  The waiter seemed shocked until I had her look at the chicken quality. The manager came out and was apologetic so it made it a little more tolerable having to wait for a redo of the salad. Everyone in my table completed their meal while I still waited for my salad. Finally got the salad, but still never saw the baby kale. My BF ordered, The lobster and shrimp macaroni. It was alright... not worth the price, tho. At the end the waitress apologize and offered a free dessert!! So all said and done, the service was a 3... food is a 1 star!!"}
{"text":"I'd pass on this place if I were you.    The only pro is that it has a nice patio on the strip and is perfect for people watching.    The cons are that the drinks are drastically overpriced with no drink specials on weekends.  On yelp there was a free appetizer with check-in.  We checked-in and asked to use it and the server refused saying it was expired.  We had literally just opened the app and never been to Vegas before.  So there is no way we had it saved from another time.  The server said he would only give it to us if he saw my husband write a 5 star review highlighting the servers name.  Of course he did it so we could get our free appetizer but then immediately changed it because the server was such an arrogant jerk.   We spent $30 on 2 drinks that were unimpressive and a waste of good money.  I would not go back to this place since they clearly have very rude employees."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. I had the tree hugger Benedict. It was ok. The eggs were perfect but the muffin was under toasted and really thick. The hash browns were covered in cheese, which in theory was great, but it was obviously done before the eggs were and it was a little tough. The mimosa was good.   The 2 main reasons for my terrible review:   1. They had a fly problem behind the bar. It made me uncomfortable to eat with the flies so Close.  2. The bartender was not friendly.  My napkin had lipstick stains on it, and she didn't even apologize. I just asked for paper napkins and she gave me a stack of bar napkins and didn't say a word."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful early dinner experience this past week at Tom's Urban. Our server Michael was so welcoming and helpful and truly seemed to enjoy his job. We ordered the lobster mac n cheese and the butter poached lobster & shrimp tacos and they were deliciously cheesy and refreshing, respectively. We washed them down with a 33oz beer and frozen margarita, which were good values (& the margarita was on happy hour special!). Michael was funny and efficient. The outdoor patio area was nice for people watching and our hostess greeted us much faster outside, as the one inside disappeared and left 7 people at the stand who all walked away. Great food and service: We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for accommodating large groups; we had a group of 13.  What we loved about this place was the variety of American foods as well as some fusion foods.  The steak nachos were AMAZING (the steak was the best part! so tender).  I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with salted caramel butter and maple syrup and EVERYONE at the table loved it so much, they came in the next morning for breakfast.  The service was awesome; our server was a bit flustered with a large group but she managed to do well.  Awesome experience here.    Beware of night/weekend patrons.  They can get a bit tipsy in the dining area."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are pretty good, but they do NOT offer happy hour on arena event nights. This includes hockey games, so this is not a good pre-game spot."}
{"text":"1st meal of my day on a Saturday.  Me and 3 friends stopped in because they offered $20 bottomless mimosas which I think is a great deal in Vegas.  Our wait was about 5 minutes, which was pretty good, but then again, we were OK sitting inside vs. the patio which helped with the wait.  Yelp Check-In here, bonus! At the suggestion of our server we went with the fried pickles vs the brussel sprouts and were were not disappointed.  The sliced pickle batter was light and crispy and the pickles weren't overly salty.  For my meal, I went with the cheeseburger sliders and fries, finished off with a Bloody Mary.  The slider bun was a little overwhelming, so I did remove 1 side to reduce the bun size, it was fine at that point.  The Bloody Mary was actually very good, but definitely spicy.  Since I'm not a veteran \"mary\" drinker, I could only finish 3/4 of the drink, but it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We waited 40 minutes for drinks. The waitress brought one glass of water for the table of four then disappeared. The table next to us went to the bar and got their own drinks.  It was a good move because after waiting for 40 minutes we got two drinks and the waitress asked the other two what that had ordered again. Food order was wrong when it finally arrived.  It was not even busy."}
{"text":"Awful for breakfast.  Went in with a party of four.  We each ordered egg based foods, three of which were scrambled and the last being a Benedict.  All of the scrambled dishes were almost inedible, I suspect they use freeze dried eggs or something based on how terrible it was.  The Benedict was cooked correctly and while it wasn't awesome it was up to par.  Second problem was the service which was totally inattentive, I couldn't get catsup in less than 15 minutes.  The last problem was they upsold us on bottomless mimosas but left out the part about them costing almost 20 bucks each!  We left with a bill for breakfast well over $100 with bad service and terrible food."}
{"text":"Food was yummy, all things being over priced in Vegas.  Good menu with some different items like edamame which were great.  Pot stickers were super too.  We sat outside to people watch and the heaters made this work out great."}
{"text":"When in Vegas you must stop at Tom's Urban for brunch.  Bottomless Mimosas for less than you would pay for one drink elsewhere, fantastic service (THANK YOU KYLE!), and really great food.  I highly recommend the chicken and cornmeal pancake, picture your favorite fried chicken over a giant buttery corn muffin top.  So good!  They also have great Eggs Benedict and some of the best grits I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were amazing. We ordered the duck wings and calamari. AMAZING. The wait staff was very friendly and informative as well!"}
{"text":"Great place for an outside meal on the strip. We ordered 4 small plates to split between the 2 of us and it was a lot of food! The 2 to 3 per person note on the menu is deceptive. Mac and Cheese and Duck wings were amazing! So were the Tom Collins and Mule. Would come back. Service is fast."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was amazing! The server was so sweet and helpful. She took the time to explain to us what was a popular dish and was very attentive with our coffees and waters.   The decor was really cool inside. We both ordered the Breakfast Burritos and they were so delicious.   We will return next time we are in town! Recommend this place :"}
{"text":"Response to Dylan T.  for Tom's Urban:    We did send it back after waiting an hour to order & another who knows what before we got our food back.  1st time we got our tacos, it was ice cold.  2nd time, it was rare & nothing but fat.  We were so frustrated, we didn't wanna send it back a 3rd time.  The salad was also limp & old, obviously straight out of a bag.  Crappy food & service.  I live here & actually work for a sister company on the strip.  I took my cousins there from out of town, pretty embarrassed I did.  For 4 people, we paid $180!  Btw, how can the cook mess up on grilled cheese sandwich? -cold too!  I also witnessed another disappointed patron who returned their food & eventually left pissed off.  U can relay this review to your VP of Operations, Doug Winter.  It was just a terrible experience going to your property"}
{"text":"Came to have bacon bourbon Bloody Mary at Tom' Urban. At 1100 it wasn't that busy but it took forever to get served at the bar. Ordered signature Mary and it came without half of the goodies. No olive no cucumber no cream cheese on the celery as advertised. We stopped a waiter passing us to see what was supposed to be in the Mary's and he brought us some goodies. Nah to on my top list..... next!"}
{"text":"The experience is pretty cool!  Food is just OK.  But the punch bowl is amazing!!!. I would probably eat there again!"}
{"text":"GF and I are locals and visited this place on a weekend and both thought the food was fantastic!   I had the Sin City burger, and my gf had the lobster tacos.   Our server Izzy was great. He was friendly, attentive, informative and he even gave us his homemade lemonade on the house and it was great!  I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"A few of us took a trip to vegas a couple of weeks ago and on our last day we stopped at this place to grab a bite to eat before our flight.  Everything was downhill from the moment we sat down. Waitress took our order and repeated it a couple of times...  the place was empty and they seemed fully staffed so i dont know why it took 25 min to get our food. there was 5 of us and only 4 orders came out...apparently one of the orders had been burnt and they had to start all over again... Only 1 of the 5 orders came out correctly  Someone had specifically said no bacon in their burger...the burger had bacon in it Someone ordered sprite and the waitress brought out Sierra mist Someone ordered a double cheeseburger medium well and one of the patties was medium well the other one was rare which means they cooked them separately.  Anyway we were a bit annoyed so we called someone over and asked to see the manager.  Mr. Hancock came by and calmly we explained our situation to him and kept cutting us off and making excuses for all the mistakes then he proceeded to say \"well what can i do to make you NOT be hostile right now...because youre being hostile\" Which was a big NO-NO because nobody was being hostile.  Anyways long story short i think Mr. Hancock realized he approached the situation all wrong and quickly changed his attitude and took a different approach in fixing the situation instead of making excuses for everything. He comped our meal which was nice and brought out some deserts on the house. He made sure to come back to our table several times to double check everything was ok and if we needed anything else.  Furthermore,  Im not sure where the miscommunication was and how almost all our orders came out wrong, however we did appreciate the manager, Hancock salvaging our lunch and turning the situation around for us so that we were able to enjoy our last meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the duck wings. The sauce that comes on it would taste good on cardboard. So yummy, definitely recommend. I also got the Brussels sprouts, which were ok. Would I get them again? Probably not.   Service in the bar was good, but the hostesses were kinda rude."}
{"text":"I had the fried pickles and the fig and cheese sandwich. Both were really good. Service was decent.  My friend got the chopped salad and it wasn't really chopped. She didn't like it.  Overall everything seemed fresh and good.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Handles allergies very well and the food is absolutely delicious.  The service is great too."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Coffee Colorado Hot Brown - Shaved turkey and smoked pit ham on sourdough, smothered with pork green chile, pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, applewood-smoked bacon; served with sweet potato fries and jerk ketchup Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with Caramel Butter Big Carrot Cake - Six layers of carrot cake with cream cheese, pecans + fresh toasted coconut  Newly opened at New York New York, and apparently part of a trio with additional locations found in Larimer and Los Angeles, Tom's Urban is not exactly the sort of restaurant one would rush to during opening week yet with the words \"Hot Brown\" featured prominently on the breakfast menu the sprawling space spilling onto the Strip immediately became a destination, a 6:30 arrival finding the kitchen just firing up as I sat in the two-hundred-plus person room with only the GM, Bartender, and a lovely server named Melissa during a seventy-five minute stay.  Recently redesigned, with urban-rustic flourishes including unfinished ceilings with globe lights above cement floors speckled with plenty of wood and glass, the general feel of Tom's Urban is of the lively variety and with plenty of LCDs showing a variety of sports the biggest flaw is that the game volume is rendered mute, the restaurant instead opting to blare Iggy Azalea and Taylor Swift at levels clearly intended to draw in traffic from the strip.  Featuring a 'late night and breakfast' menu from 11:00pm until an hour before noon the dining options at Tom's run the gamut of 'global' cuisine and with at least fifty selections available there were tough choices to be made - Las Vegas Boulevard pricing yielding $10-for-3 flapjacks and the aforementioned Hot Brown for $21, the $3 cup of coffee kept brimming throughout the meal the only real \"bargain,\" though aside from false-maple syrup the ingredients were high quality all around.  Waiting and watching Kirk Herbstreit's mouth move while Katy Perry's voice poured from speakers overhead it was perhaps fifteen minutes before two plates arrived and greeted by the GM during that time suffice it to say that neither portion was skimpy, the bursting blueberries amongst buttermilk batter not really benefitted by upsold butter but light, fluffy, and flavorful when gilded with syrup brought from home while the \"Denver\" take on the Louisville staple was anything but authentic with a bold spice profile only serving to enhance the smoky sapor of pork alongside moist turkey on thick, buttery bread.  Originally told that desserts were only available at dinner, but pleading my case that Carrot Cake is a perfectly rational post-breakfast treat, it was with 'best I've ever had' promises from my server that the moist slice arrived and although certainly not quite matching the high standards set by Jerry's Nugget or Citizens the $9 six-layer selection was still quite impressive with a restrained spice profile still allowed to shine by keeping the frosting less sweet than most, a spin that may appeal to those desiring a more savory dessert.  Clearly suffering from Strip-style pricing (and unwilling to offer this info online) those sitting down for a meal at Tom's Urban are likely to find something they enjoy from the wide ranging menu and although several similar \"upscale American\" restaurants exist throughout Las Vegas none of them are serving a Hot Brown of any form, nor Duck Wings or an interesting selection of street tacos, before dawn."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a new friend in sweet Mary Ayala at Tom's Urban in the New York New York Hotel.  We stayed at NYNY three nights while celebrating our marriage/honeymoon and visited Mary's bar station twice, both times enjoying the amazing pot stickers and the delicious specialty drinks.  Also tried the huge Green Chile Burrito, very delicious!  Wish I'd had time to try more selections.  Hope to get a chance to return to this Tom's and/or the location in Denver soon."}
{"text":"Took forever for the hostess to bring us to our table even tho the table was set up long ago.  The waiter was polite and professional however, and made the experience much better.  Big ass egg roll was actually very good, love the spiciness but didn't really dig the fried tortilla skin"}
{"text":"Not really sure how to rate Tom's, we had gone a few times in March of 2017 and then again in September of 2017 so we're really looking forward to going back when we came in April. We had been salivating just thinking about the hash browns. It's the first place we went when we arrived on Sunday! But oh my horrible does not describe how bad they were!!!! The hash browns looked as though all they had done was thaw them and did not cook them at all. We base this on the fact they were cold, and the same color as straight out of the freezer and the cheese had never been melted. A women came over and asked how everything was and we told her the potatoes were not cooked and I had ordered Swiss cheese in my omelet and was given cheddar. She took mine back and they remade my omelet and gave me what I think were new potatoes. While the omelet was good the potatoes had not much improved they definitely were put in a skillet as the cheese had started to melt but the potatoes were lukewarm and basically raw. We had planned on eating all 3 days we were there but did not go back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the Cuban sandwich and it was amazing. We had a big group and they were to accommodate us very well. The place was real chill and it was fun with the group I went with. It was a very kid friendly place."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch around 11:30 in the morning. The staff were absolutely friendly and helpful. Great food and great value! Have definitely found my new favorite breakfast spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Eddie took great care of us. Dinner was delicious. Especially liked the pickles. The atmosphere was fun with the hockey game on too. Great time."}
{"text":"After an afternoon stroll in the strip, we ended up being all exhausted, hungry & thirsty for more alcohol..what's new? Saw this place & it sure looks inviting because of their patio bar & seating. We were greeted by a couple pretty hostesses &a seated by The awesome Michael. He's been really good & friendly to us. We were treated like VIP's and been checked in by him every 10 minutes to make sure we're still good & have everything we need.   Food is amazing, had fried calamari, Brussel sprouts & steak nachos. Ordered a punch bowl called the Grapefruit jailhouse Rita. It's super good & we've been staying here for a couple hours now -yes, writing this review while I'm seating here as some of my friends are watching the Baseball World Series which I'm not a big fan of but they have these tv's all over which makes it more entertaining.  Shout out to Michael! Restaurants need more of you!"}
{"text":"We popped by last night after looking for an outdoor restaurant. We all had great food and drinks. My husband and I had the al carbon steak nacho de which were fully loaded. A friend had the avocado  bacon burger, requested without a bun. While that was not the burger he ordered, he really enjoyed it. My gf ordered the chicken potstickers and was happy with that as well. My husband had a drink he loved. Think it was called last man walking? With tequila pineapple guava etc. it was amazing. The service was super super slow. If it was faster we would have stayed to drink. Other than that it was great. Pretty sure we will try again while we are here"}
{"text":"Just ok service. They weren't overly busy and we had to ask for napkins, along with a rather large minute wait between drink order, delivery then food order and delivery. The decor is cute, and the menu descriptions are very funny. I ordered the eggs Benedict (which by the way I am on a worldwide quest to find my fave eggs Bennie) Finally arrived at my table and there were the following issues: 1. Tomatoes were atop my eggs Benedict which I have never seen before and I hate tomatoes so I had to scrape them off which in turn scraped off the hollandaise sauce so I had to ask for another side of sauce.  2. I said sauce was lumpy which is kind of hard to understand because the hollandaise sauce is just a cream sauce. The sauce itself lacked flavor 3. I cut into my first half of the Benedict and the egg was darn near cooked all the way through. There was no run to the egg and completely over poached.  4. The ham was fine  5. The English Muffin was over done. Crusty outside then extremely chewy.   I expect a lot out of my eggs Bennie and I got a lot of nothing from this order. I was rather disappointed. They could see that I wasn't enjoying it and did not ask if something was wrong or if they could do anything else. I just pushed it around my plate and told them to take it away."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Toms Urban. We came here after our wedding last night for dinner with a party of 14. I made the reservation for 4:30 with Kaitlyn the hostess a few days before, she was so sweet and made sure we got a table on the patio we arrived a little early around 3:50 because the wedding let out sooner than expected but our table was ready and they sat us immediately! Emanuel was our server and he was so great and really made our dinner special. So thank you all for making my wedding day memorable, I couldn't have chose a better place! P.s the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I got 2 Words for you. DUCK WINGS! This place was PHENOMAL! Hospitality on the strip is honestly Unmatched across the country but Ton Urban's menu across the board is an awesome value & good eating. The shin on& grits were above par & the service for such a busy spot is admirable. I'm going back tonight"}
{"text":"From within NY NY hotel you cannot tell the full potential of Tom's.  When walking down LVB, looking for an outdoor place to get Happy for a few hours, snack and people watch I did not realize that it was the same Tom's we had walked by the day before inside the hotel.  Great outdoor patio, delicious potstickers  and edimami and draft beers (large selection!) They run their happy hour with food and drinks priced by the hour, the earlier the cheaper (from 4 to 5, then 5 to 6 and then 6 to 7)...genius.  Our server ELIZABETH was attentive and sweet while not being overbearing...almost 3 hours for 2 people our bill came to $65, SCORE!"}
{"text":"Came into town for the marathon. Got down to the restaraunt at 1015 and was told that the wait was 40 min. After an hour we were seated and once or waitress came we ordered our omelets only to be told they were out of omelets. We ordered something else and after an hour we were told that the kitchen was running behind and she would let us know when it would be coming.   Don't mind the wait but how do you run out of omelets.....and still have eggs.   Nice service but horrible wait times and would not eat again."}
{"text":"Food is advertised as \"hip and cool\". Really pretty average. Service was slow and food was on floor of Las Vegas TU. Just ate there and would not go back."}
{"text":"Best bloody Mary's ever!!!! Breakfast was excellent and the wait staff is super cool!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late night bite and saw in the menu the special that had select drinks and food for $6 and $7 between 11-12. When we got our bill the tacos were $18 and the drink was $14.50. The waitress said it doesn't apply on Saturday nights. Well, DONT PUT IN BOLD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MENU! Tacos were good, drinks are sickeningly sweet and obviously made from a pre made mix."}
{"text":"Great patio, right on the strip, and even better food. The hummus is plenty to go around, and the chicken tacos are a must-try. Thanks to my server Timothy for recommending the frozen mule!"}
{"text":"The duck wings are incredible and the cole slaw they rest on take no backseat! And those the brussel sprouts were super yummy! My server Michael made the experience EXCELLENT! You will see me again Tom Urban."}
{"text":"I was so, so disappointed but that was probably because the menu looks so good and all the descriptions are mouth-watering.   Let me back up. First, the service. Our waiter was actually really nice and explained thing to us, but we had to wait a bit to get seated in this awkward area. That was not an issue though, just something to mention. No stand to indicate where we should wait.  Next, the menu. It looked amazing! So delicious and descriptive and imaginative. Now if only they could follow through on the execution, it would have been a wonderful meal.  We ordered Calamari, small plate mac n cheese with the pork, side of creamed spinach and a burger. The calamari was the best thing by far. My BF said the burger was good, but I didn't have a bite so I can't judge. The side of creamed spinach was nice, but not great. Just sort of eh. The mac n cheese was made with american cheese. Or velveeta. Either way, it was just odd. I mean, kinda tasty in the way that I could eat it and didn't need to send it back, but not so much that I would ever order it again.  Overall, I think I may skip this place next time around, unless I read they get their act together and get some better quality food."}
{"text":"This was probably the worse experience I've had. The bartender didn't acknowledge my fiancé and I even though we sat there for 20 minutes just looking at her. The food was horrible! Burger sliders were dry, no flavor, full of mustard and just disgusting. I asked for endless mimosas, but she never came to serve me another one until like 40 mins late and says there's 10 mins left. So I asked to change my bill to just the 1 and she was upset and rolled her eyes. The fries were cold and flavorless. The only good thing was the mac n cheese, but it was also cold. I wouldn't go to this specific location again. It isn't the consumers problems that they are short on employees and tired. The bartender kept making comments to another employee about how she had to go, but had to do a lot before and she was over her shift. I expect great service since was I am paying for such."}
{"text":"Initially sat at a table and we waited 10min....no server. So.....  My son and I went to the bar and Elaine served us right away.  She is most fabulous!!!  Must be 21 to sit at the bar.  Ordered the Sin City Cooler, Shrimp Po Boy Sliders and Fries Two Ways.  Sliders could use more slaw but everything else was super fantastic.  Convenient to TMobile Arena and perfectly worth a stop for food truck type grub.  Bonus..... This place played Def Leppard High 'N Dry ...who does that?????  Tom's does!!!!"}
{"text":"Another win for this place.  Miranda, who helped us through a very difficult time, is no longer here but thank goodness for Nate! You're wonderful Nate thank you for the entertainment with the awesome food. We like you even though you're a ducks fan."}
{"text":"Ordered eggs benedict. Sauce had no kick to it. It was mainly buttery/cheesy taste. Gross."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of this place, I expected more. But service was terrible. A few people in my group ordered the bottomless mimosa and our server only came over once in the hour we had been there. When asked for a refill, our server told us they are no longer serving the bottomless mimosa. This is ridiculous. We paid $20 each for the mimosa and were ignore. It also too over an hour to get our food. After waiting for our food, I was told they forgot to order my food. It took another 40 mins to get my order. Not to mention that we had 3 people who come down late and had ordered 5 mins after the rest of the group and it too there food 30 mins longer to come than the rest of the table. When our food did arrive, it was cold, as if it had been sitting in the window for awhile. When all 11 of us agreed we had a bad experience, I know they restaurant did something wrong.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star was because the manager, Tim, did everything he could to make things right. The food also tasted good, albeit, cold. Ultimately, the damage had been done, but for the 2+ hours of miserable service, it was a relief to have Tim comp our meal. At least we left with a less of a sour taste in our mouth. I would love to recommend this place to friends and family, but after this experience, I just can't do that."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm not one to write too many reviews, but this place is great. The staff is so genuinely nice and warm... shoutout to Amberly and the food is delicious, to boot!  We're in Las Vegas for a work show and it's nice to dine in a place without the jacked up Vegas prices, too. I would come back again even if I wasn't staying at New York New York.   Bottom line: go for a casual dining experience with fantastic service!!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing amazing but it's worth a try, especially for the beat the clock specials during happy hour. You can get this special anywhere in the restaurant or patio, not just at the bar The street tacos are enjoyble and two of them are decently filling if you're just looking for a quick bite. They regular/sweet potato fries are about what you'd expect. The Moscow Mule was solid as well. Service was fine.  This isn't a must try in Vegas or anything but the beat the clock is worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good food in a great location on the strip to people watch and enjoy the sites, but their menu is way way overpriced!  The price they charge for a .50c order of edamame says it all."}
{"text":"The menu is good. The food is ok.  Our server was pleasant but the hostess was obnoxious."}
{"text":"The hamburgers with absolutely amazing! I highly recommend the green chili burger fantastic cooked medium rare to perfection love the place great atmosphere our server Izzy even serenaded us! You know it was pretty good overall great experience!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch & I just had a chicken caesar salad, which was a decent size. We also ordered the fried duck wings... It was good, but if I were to order it again, I'd get the sauce on the side. It came smothered in a glazy sauce, which was good, but a bit overpowering. The service was ok. We sat at the bar, and there seemed to be only one person working the whole bar, so it was a little slow, waiting on getting my drink filled.  I'm not sure if anything wow'd me there, so I'm not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"Amber Ly was our server this afternoon before the Golden Knights game. She was very attentive to the service and guided us through the menu. I ordered the sangria rojo, which was absolutely amazing. I'm more of a white wine drinker but the red wine was amazing.   I highly recommend this place if you're going to an event, game, or even visiting!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and Eddie from the restaurant recommended we try the lemon rosemary tots. Overall a fun experience in LV."}
{"text":"We were staying in New York New York and ended up coming to this place every day for breakfast. Our whole group enjoyed Nitro coffee every morning, it was delicious. Their breakfast omelets are giant and taste amazing. I also tried their fried chicken and cornbread - which was also a huge portion. I went back everyday for the nitro coffee not their menu. There's some good things on there, but definitely ran out of things I wanted to eat by the second time around."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated and hidden spots on the strip! The drinks are fairly cheap and they have tons to choose from and the food is very good and delicious. You have to get the homemade pop tart of the day and the lobster tacos. The garlic edamame is also amazing as is the potstickers, mac & cheese, hashbrowns, and any of the burgers. Our server, Bear, was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the menu looks amazing but unfortunately we did not have the chance to try it. We were waiting almost 30 minutes at the table and no waitress approached us. Place was not even 20% capacity and waitresses just passed us by. We felt totally ignore. We left the table and the lady at the entrance told us \"have a good night\" she did not even notice nobody offered us a drink."}
{"text":"Great food for the location & price!! Its not often that you find a really good restaurant located on the strip. They tend to cut corners to supply the demand. Well NOT here at Toms Urban!! Their food is great.   The lettuce wraps The shrimp & grits The lobster sandwich The pot stickers  All were very good!! Flavorful and well seasoned!   Kudos to Toms Urban for not cutting corners on the food preparation & taste!!!"}
{"text":"So me and a few friends cane here for lunch. .. and oh my ******* gosh.  The service was horrible.  Or waiter told us that he couldn't put a good order in before a drink order. Because he didn't want to confuse or order with the table next to us.  Wth? Then we waited over 30 mins for two burgers and a philly steak sandwich.  And there was  no apologies.  I would not recommend if you ate on a time crunch."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for dinner late Sunday and honestly had an amazing experience. I am so glad we didn't go off of some random bad reviews and gave this place a chance!!   We initially were going to go to a place further down the strip but the menu and food looked good here. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we had the most amazing service.   Mike our server was extremely knowledgeable, warm and friendly. He made our experience here perfect. Service in Vegas is sometime a hit or miss and barely ever memorable but I am pretty sure we will be requesting him the next time we come back.  We ordered the Crispy Duck Wings to start. These were delicious! They were crispy and juicy. The flavor was amazing too, just the right amount of kick. The sauce is hella sticky so ask for extra napkins.   I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, they were freaking amazing. The Shrimp were plump and juicy, the grits were creamy, luscious and cheesy. Everything went very well together with a spicy sauce and thick cut bacon bits to top it all off. My love ordered the chicken which was also pretty amazing. Crunchy and full of flavor. The chicken portion is humongous so order with care.  Mike made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal, the manager even came by to check up on us. The service was just great and the food was even better.   Mike informed us Tom's is coming to Oregon which is closer to Seattle. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Toms urban was amazing! We went there for breakfast every morning while staying at the New York New York it was great! The staff was super friendly and the food was very good. We even went back for lunch and dinner one day, and we're not disappointed. Also, the pop tarts are super bomb."}
{"text":"So came here early in night on our way out. Chris made phenomenal margarita and Long Island ice tea! We left and went on our way to experience \"the strip.\" After obnoxiously overpriced and under-liquored drinks, we ended back here and got new drinks from a new bartender and ordered food. Food was fantastic with lots of flavor and drinks were fantastic too! I'm a margarita snob so it's hard to find consistency. They are awesome here and service is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Did Sunday brunch here on my trip to Vegas. Can you say bottomless mimosas? Yessss! A little pricey for the food but as expected since it's right on the strip. We absolutely loved the outdoor seating. Comfy benches and seats made it feel very patio- like. The beer menu was fabulous. Plenty of local brews plus some standards. I opted for an omelette that was perfectly done with mushrooms, avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. It came with grits/ polenta which was excellent. My friend went with the salted caramel French toast (omg) - phenomenal! I thought it would be too sweet but it was amazing. Brunch on the weekends lasts until 4pm so you can take your time even if you slept in after last night's drinking haha. Great place I'd definitely go again while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in about 10:30pm to get some food in us. Ordered a couple of drinks, a fries 2 way, duck wings and sticky belly bun. Food and service were both decent. I remember everything tasting super sweet. Probably our fault ordering what we did. But, it was all pretty much one-note. Nothing memorable about this meal, including the service."}
{"text":"After the management reached out to me and asked me to come back and give them another try we found ourselves in vegas again and decided to give them another go. While we did not have a rude Hostess this time, she still seemed a little under trained. Our experience left us with almost the same opinion, the food is just too average for the price. We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer the big ass egg roll and a sloppy burger for an entree. Problem 1) they didn't bring the fried pickles until they brought the food at the same time.. what's the point of me ordering an appetizer to have it brought with my entree. Problem 2) the food was really average, the fry on the pickle was almost non-existent what was there was soggy the egg roll was overcooked and the sloppy Burger was a big plate that looks like throw up with a burger in the middle. Problem 3) is a bit of a good and bad, the location is nice to sit out on the patio and people watch but if you're sitting along the edge it's also close enough to be accosted by a homeless person asking for food - which we were. The positive was sitting outside during nice weather, drinking beer, and watching an MMA fight...I could probably do that anywhere else and not pay $8.50 a beer. So while I appreciate the management efforts I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"We (3) went here for breakfast and had the in house made cherry pop-tart and lemon rosemary tater tots for starters, both good but pop tart was pricey and not that many tots but Vegas strip pricing applies so was not totally unexpected. I had the figgy piggy breakfast sandwich which was very good. Wife had the salted caramel skillet French toast, she said it was pretty sweet but ordered a side of bacon and that helped cut the sweetness. Our friend had the beach bum omelet and did not have any complaints. Service was fast but did have to summon another waiter for an empty water glass."}
{"text":"Only reason why this spot doesn't get 1 star is because the service was good... Food was absolutely gross. I ordered the BBQ Thai salmon..... Which ended up being a small slab of a mess. Extremely small piece of fish and was EXTREMELY salty!!! Not to mention it was overpriced. 24$ for a gross piece of fish over salad?? So I replaced the salmon with cheeseburger sliders.... Figured that would be good and basic, hard to mess up.  You can tell the entire burger (bun, cheese, meat) was microwaved. Effing gross. Best part of my meal was the lemon water."}
{"text":"Barely giving three stars and mostly bc the ambiance is nice.   The food ranged from mediocre to meh. We shared the Cuban (passable) with garlic fries (which arrived cold and chewy). We requested fresh fries and got a second set that was even greasier and only a tad less chewy. We requested the potsticker apps to come out first but they arrived with our main meal. They were also cold and soggy. The presentation was totally unappetizing (wilted greens with sad garlic slices). The Mac and cheese with pork and green chile was the best of bunch, but definitely not memorable.   Expensive mediocre food for a casual restaurant.   They have a nice strip-view deck that will be lovely in the summer. Go for drinks and the ambiance, skip the food."}
{"text":"Really good food. Our waitress -  Lina - was terrific. Super friendly and attentive during our brunch. Strong recommendation."}
{"text":"Instead of going to yet another brunch buffet option, we thought we'd try Tom's Urban for breakfast instead.  It turned out to be a great decision. The server was attentive, the mimosas were big and plentiful, and the food tasted great.  The place has a casual but classy atmosphere and although the seating was open (i.e. tables, not booths), you didn't feel like you were eating or talking with everyone around you. I am definitely looking forward to going back and trying something off the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Over priced food (14 dollars for giant plate of lettuce, pretty rude service, and just a bad vibe in general. Go to shake shack next door"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. We got in right away. Paige was our server and she was awesome. Very friendly and helpful!  We got the hummus plate and Brussel sprouts as an appetizer."}
{"text":"This is the greatest pop tart i have ever had in my Life. The location is great and we will def be back seeing as we are locals and i work on the strip"}
{"text":"My 5stars are going to the lounge bartender, since I haven't really get to enjoy the restaurant itself.  I stop by Tom's Urban yesterday night after work for the first time. I just had couple drinks but it was nice to experience such a quality service despite of the late hours we came in. Our bartender Ilan was the greatest!!! Positive attitude, pleasant personality and oh my..that cocktail he made!!! Exactly what you need after a long evening at work!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Cornbread pankcakes ! Amazing !!!! Pretty quick service. If you check in you get a free appetizer. Good for any age."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before a show at the new arena.  Enjoyed the taco plate with shrimp and lobster while my friend had a meat taco plate.   Both were cooked perfectly and very flavorful.    Our waiter Michael was exceptional!!!   It was like we had known him forever.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have ate here.  Tonight, I had the arugula salad with goat cheese.  Our server was Case (Casey) and we were so happy with him.  He went the extra steps to ensure we had a great meal and experience.   I love the decor.  Brightly colored, orange, yellow and wood tones.  Everything was clean and the staff was right on the ball.    We recommend you come here if you are looking for a great meal and be sure to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"The breakfast portions were huge and clearly intended for someone dealing with a hangover or getting ready for a long day of drinking. :)   We just stopped by for breakfast before heading out to the Grand Canyon, so we were probably not their intended clients. But the food was descent, about what I would expect at a diner. But better than going to any of the fast food places.  Overall, a good meal but not memorable."}
{"text":"Their food was pretty good; massive nachos:). Service was okay, but was taking a long time for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Good food, hearty portions and good customer service basically sum up my experiences at Tom's Urban. Came on a Monday morning and it wasn't too busy. Our server Salina was extremely helpful, patient and courteous throughout our entire brunch. She made helpful suggestions and even took a drink off our tab, when the Watermelon Moscow Mule we ordered was a little too sweet for our liking. They made a new Mule without protest and it was perfect. I ordered the breakfast blt and my other two friends ordered benedicts. We were all thoroughly satisfied with our selections. The standouts were the polenta cheese grits (holy cow were they good!) and the cheesy hash browns. Tom's is solid!"}
{"text":"Get your tails here for breakfast, enjoy their strong coffee and bold breakfast flavors, then get you a house made pop tart for \"breakfast dessert\", because every meal deserves dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every experience is not the same as last time. It gets better.   Tonight Eddie took great care of me and my lady. After spending the evening singing and dancing at the piano bar we headed over to Tom's Urban for some late night snackies.  Had the fried pickles to start. Not disappointed. Moved onto the mini mac and cheese.  Followed by the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. Thank you \"whatever deity you pray or not pray to\" for this food!! All delicious! The mac and cheese was hot and creamy. The sliders were perfect. Hot. Spicy hot. Just like I like them.   Tom's Urban never disappoints. From the food to the staff (Thanx Eddie!). Go!"}
{"text":"We went to Tom's Urban for an after hours meal. The place was lively, extremely reasonably priced, and well staffed. We got great food and service. And they even had food options sensitive to individuals with dietary restrictions. Definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Service is slow and food is very subpar. The price doesn't make sense for what was offered."}
{"text":"Great beer list and so many choices on the menu...frog legs! Perfect stop for a big group on the central strip. Eddie was tops as a server - see if you get him."}
{"text":"Garbage. Went there with my mom. She had the shrimp and avocado salad, after which she had digestive symptoms the following day. I had the burger, which seemed to be prepared well, but was doused in ketchup and mustard. If this is the only way these people know how to season a burger, they need to get out of the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Bar food and drinks.. nice patio setup.. full bar, good beer selections and small plates.. I'd like to go back and check this place out for breakfast/brunch .. they had some interesting late night eats/early morning options that looked delicious.. the chili mac and cheese hit the spot.. a tad salty but satisfying"}
{"text":"the food isn't bad....if you can ever get a server to stop by your table to take your order for food. We've been to Tom's several different times during a visit....9am, 2am, 5pm, 8pm....and every time it takes an extremely long time for any server to approach your table - even at 2am in the morning when you stop in for a late night snack and there are only 3 other tables with customers! the last 2 times, we walked out after seeing other tables sat before us not having service for at least the 20 minutes that we sat at our table with no greeting, server, etc....who happened to walk by our table several times. Unfortunately not going to be giving them another chance after 3 tries. too bad since the food isn't bad but only had opportunity to try twice..."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Tom's for breakfast on a Tuesday morning.  We ordered the Eggs Benedict with filet.  My Filet was cooked perfectly!  My wife ordered the breakfast burrito with Steak.  Again her food was excellent!  Perfect sized portions, not too large but definitely filling.  Service was a bit slow to start but our server was very kind and checked on us frequently."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a beautiful day.   I ordered some plain two egg special. The hash browns were drenched in butter. The eggs were okay. Bacon is what kept me pushing on.   My husband had the pancakes. They were delicious. It reminded me of funnel cake because it had some crisp to it. I don't know how they did it but it was good.   Service was good. I'd come back for the service. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have the people watching of the strip there."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch two mornings in a row because I enjoyed it so much! I sat outside on the awesome patio they had. The service was excellent both times. I sat at the bar the second day and our bartender was super friendly and helpful.   I had the veggie omelet, side salad, and sourdough bread. It was an enormous amount of food so the price to food ratio was well worth it. My friend ordered their salted caramel French toast and it was crazy delicious and was also a whopping portion. You could definitely split some of these meals if your not ridiculously hungry.  They had really amazing Blood Mary's and they had a wide variety of beers and ciders on tap. You can even do a flight if you like. Definitely check this place out if you want an affordable and trendy meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nate and Eeron were awesome! Their recommendations on lunch were amazing! The philly was so tender and delicious. The fries were cooked perfectly and Nate was great in recommendations in drinks and appetizers. I have never had such amazing Brussel sprouts. The restaurant is perfectly located so you can sit inside or outside with great views and can still meet and talk with friends. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've visited this bar/restaurant twice now and have passed by several times when staying at New York New York Hotel and Casino.   My first visit was with a group of 12 people, I know, a very large party. Tom's Urban is a pretty large restaurant and there were tons of seats available but we weren't seated right away. I understand it was probably due to our group size, but we were completely content with sitting in the bar area. This was something we had to suggest before it was even an option. The vibe was fun, there are tons of TVs for sports and the food was delicious; however the service was okay. Maybe our group size was a little intimidating. We unfortunately didn't get checked on often or waters/drinks re-filled. Overall we had a great time - still cool place.   The second visit it was just my husband and I during Sunday brunch (12-2pm). It wasn't busy, many open tables and we were seated farthest from the televisions and bar. We felt like we could have easily been hidden or forgotten so we asked to sit a little closer into the restaurant for better views of the sports games and service (if needed). Unfortunately it seemed that they were incredibly understaffed because service was very slow. I felt really bad for the server and saw that she was working hard, where others in the audience just felt service was poor. We ordered a few small plates and overall enjoyed our time.   I rate this place three stars cause I think it has so much potential! Its so fun, good location, vibe, music and food. I just wish they staffed better to make the delivery and overall experience more memorable."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere on the Vegas strip. Food is pretty good with a variety of food and drink options.  Great place to relax, have a drink and take in the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Brunch and IT.Was.AMAZING. The food was delicious, I had the Veggie Benedict with bottomless mimosas. My husband had a custom omelet and the beer flight, which was a generous serving of 4 beers of your choice. We sat outside, where the view was great and the atmosphere was fun! When we were ready to leave, the server gave me a Mimosa to-go, which was awesome! Fantastic place, I'd recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Staying at New York New York...this by far is best place to hang and eat for and urban feel and meals. Waitstaff and hosts very friendly. Our server was Nate he gave us great service and tip on places we should see during our stay. Sunday fun day bottomless mimosas must."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Highly recommend the Prime Rib Philly Cheeseteak Dip and the Truffle Lobster Roll.  Both outstanding but I think the Prime Rib edged out the Lobster Roll.  Awesome service and huge portions.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food and service was both good.. they had a happy hour special that changed with hour. So get there early.  I was amazed that they had lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I was craving for some late night eats, so it's a good thing that this place closes late, however the quality of the food isn't that great. I would say that this is more of a place for happy hour drinks and food, but even that - I felt that the taste and quality of the food is quite lacking.  We ordered:  1. Lobster & Shrimp Mac n Cheese: One would think that the dish is rich and creamy with delicious seafood. The Mac n cheese was decent and flavorful, but the lobster tasted very dry and overcooked along with the shrimp. I would skip this one (3/5)  2. NYNY Strip: The steak came out burnt and dry. The picture would say otherwise, but it didn't taste so great in the mouth. It came with sweet potato fries, which were decent, along with Moroccan ketchup. The ketchup was okay. For a pricey meal, it just wasn't worth it (3/5)  Service was decent, but we could tell that they kind of wanted us out of the place - that sucks, one shouldn't feel rushed to finish eating; we are the customers! But anyways, for the price that you pay for the meal, it just doesn't match up to par with the quality you expect from the food."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food and great service from our server Paige. Really easy place to grab dinner and a drink before seeing a show at New York New York."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! When we arrived, the hostess was very friendly and even took the time to recommend some of her favorite dishes to us. You could tell she was really proud of the restaurant. We started with the French fries 2 ways... OMG. SO good! I am not usually one to order French fries as an appetizer, but I am so glad I did! The garlic shoestring fries with the jerk ketchup and the Cinnamon sweet potato fries were perfect! My one year old loved them too! For dinner, I had the \"Big A- Eggroll\" and my husband had the lobster and crab mac and cheese. Mine was good, a little spicy and tough to chew, but good flavor. I tried the Mac and cheese and it was surprisingly good! I normally think Mac and cheese is bland, but with the lobster and crab, it was great! We got a cherry homemade pop tart for dessert, and I have to say, it was the most disappointing part of the meal. It was cold and kinda soggy and the icing was too sweet. But, overall, it was a great place, good food, great service, and I'd definitely go back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Food was good enough.  Nothing superb.  The restaurant, which had JUST opened when we went was having some problems though.  There were no glasses for whatever reason, so we had to wait for quite a while for our drinks.  No big deal, our server kept us informed and did a great job at keeping us happy.    The food could be better, and I am sure that it will improve.  We had the truffled mushroom flatbread (if I can remember correctly).  It was tasty, although a bit oily.  Not to the point of being inedible, but more than to my liking.  I gave feedback to our waiter simply because if I was opening a restaurant, I would want to know as well.  Overall taste was pretty good though.    The patio here is superb for people watching!    In a nutshell, I am always understanding when a restaurant first opens.  I would try this place again."}
{"text":"First, we came here for a restaurant week dinner (local restaurants offer pre-fix menus and donate $ from each meal to 3 square), trying to get one more stop in before it ended and thought we'd try a new place and maybe gain a new favorite. We were very disappointed when we asked for the menus and were told they \"stopped doing that already\". We already paid for parking and schlepped through the casino to try this place so we stayed.  The waiter was kinda pushy suggesting I not get a happy hour drink but pay for a larger one and convinced my husband not to do a beer flight. I decided on the happy hour Tom's backyard lemonade and he got a beer he's had before. Both drinks were good, mine was plenty big enough. We got a couple happy hour bites to start and they were good, nothing special. Then we started to notice that we were swatting away flies, that was pretty annoying. Was also confusing until we realized part of the restaurant is open to the street so I guess flies just get in. I took the waiters recommendation and ordered the lobster & shrimp Mac n cheese and my husband ordered the pickle brined fried chicken with grits. The chicken and grits were both very good! My Mac n cheese was not. The pasta was cooked perfect and the cheese was tasty but overall it had a very \"fishy\" smell and taste. After finding a 3rd bite of uncleaned shrimp I couldn't handle eating any more. All I could think of was how many shrimp veins had I eaten?!?  We decided to not bother with desert. We had planned to spend $40 ea + $ on drinks for a pre-fix 3 course meal for restaurant week, our check was instead about $75."}
{"text":"Only 10 minutes left for happy hour according to the menu and video display but the medioker waiter says \"no\"its event night... no happy hour.... isn't there an event in Las Vegas every night???  not so happy with high prices and like warm fries, warm beer and less than good service!"}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch with a view of the strip. Great atmosphere!  sat outside in the patio. I have to say that our food took a very long time but the manager apologized and comped our drinks.  had eggs and sausage hash browns! Very good! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great spot.   I wish they would put the egg roll back on the menu.    Fun place to bring a group.   Ruth was awesome."}
{"text":"Very nice open patio seating on the strip outside the New York, New York Hotel & casino BUT terrible service.   Was greeted by a host who had no clue about Happy Hour and didn't even bother to find out & and get back to us."}
{"text":"Excellent food, even better service. Our server Eddie suggested the frog legs & he wasn't lying when he said they were Delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty awful. Crap service, server didn't bother to ask if we needed separate checks- we have him 2 cards assuming he'd split up our  bill based on what we ordered. Slow service, especially for how slow restaurant was and for what we ordered. Food wasn't great either. Had hummus trio. Hummus was fine but toast points I was give were stale. It was pretty gross.   I would pass on this place, better places in the same area."}
{"text":"Great service but something is up with their bottomless mimosas. I think they got everclear confused with champagne. I recommend getting a bottom aka only drink one"}
{"text":"*based on my experience*   First time at Toms Urban, right off the strip in between New York New York and Shake Shack. OMG! Food was delicious, drinks were great. Our server, Rosa, was great and friendly. Amazing customer service. The Brussels Sprouts and fried pickle appetizer was perfect! We got our food right on time, we ordered the Huevos Benedicto yumm! They came out great. Definitely will make another visit when I'm back here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. Would've given them more stars but the service was horrible and the atmosphere was uninviting. Waitress breezed by as if riding on a bullet train, took our order, messed it up. No apologies either. AARGGH!!"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas at least twice a year and always eat  at Tom's Urban. Their sin city burger is my favorite. The location is right on the sidewalk of the strip so it's a great place to people watch. Our server Paige was very friendly and made our experience even better than other visits. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service sucked. We ordered Duck Wings (YUM!), All American Sliders (sans cheese cuz lactose and I don't agree)... (also YUM), and sweet potato fries (not so yum...standard frozen out-of-the-bag). Our waiter only came when we got his attention. Other perks: great view of the strip from the patio, drinks were timely and tasty."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Tom's Urban then we went in. Just after 4pm they are switching menus but service really slow and not busy. We order the pork chili and beef tacos. The beef tacos were cold, uneventful, no taste. We swapped for the mac n cheese, which after a LONG wait came out and was hot and covered with pulled pork. The pork chili was tasty, but really thin like a soup not my expectations for chili. If you want a tasty soup it's a good choice. It was accompanied with a folded tortilla that was so hard and dried out to be inedible. Ambience is different. Roomy. Loud. Too many other good places to eat at."}
{"text":"This was honestly disappointing for Vegas. We wanted a good breakfast spot and based on reviews and the menu picked this place.  We ordered the \"Treehugger\" and the breakfast platter.  This was so average and bland I'd rather eat at a fast food joint for breakfast.  The Treehugger has avocado and it was browning on the edges.  The hash browns were almost cold and had no flavor.  The only thing decent on our played was the cheesy grits.  For $15 a plate, I'd say stay away as there are much better options around."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, a little pricey, $13 for a non fancy nothing special Bloody Mary but food is amaze service blew ass it's an inconvenience to ask anyone for anything. But the food is 5 star"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice light place to eat dinner and found toms urban. Best decision ever. Highly recommend the lobster sliders, best lobster I've had. Staff is great too. Will definitely be visiting again once we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is really good. It is located right outside of nyny hotel and casino. When you walk up its mostly all outside seating with tvs and then indoor seating with two bars inside. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day and had a good view of the strip and the TV to watch March madness. The food is on the expensive side but worth it. The portions are good sizes while the quality of food is good. The garlic fries are a must try. Our waitress was awesome and attentive, I believe her name was janiffer she had an awesome accent as well. I will eat here again and if your in town give it a try. Also if you are an M life card member give them your card so you can earn tier points!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and loved it!! The atmosphere is great and so was the food! Started with the Bloody Mary- Delish and not heavy. If you check in- get the fried pickles. They were so good!! Ordered the breakfast burrito no tortilla over hash browns with carnitas- OMG! Definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, when we first arrived it was somewhat busy but quickly emptied out. The waitress was good at first but once we ordered, never saw her again. It took an hour to get sliders (?!) unacceptable service. The only good thing is sitting outside and people watching. After we got our food, we had to track down our waitress for a refill on our drinks."}
{"text":"Come for the Crispy Duck Wings n Crispy Brussel Sprouts n stay for the great, fun, personable service. You can't go wrong with the \"Sticky\" Belly tacos or Urban Pizzas for that matter. If you're lucky enough to get Scott or Ali as your  bartender, they will take great care of you!  If you're on the floor, Zack or Anna, they are not only fast and detailed but there are a lot of fun.  I visit Las Vegas three four five times times a year and this is easily my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Lots of space, unique items on the menu, friendly staff make this place worth the time. Breakfast skillet was perfect. Being a bit of a coffee snob they could improve using a locally roasted supplier......keeping in mind the coffee here was better than most breakfast places on the strip."}
{"text":"Pretty shitty food, service, and atmosphere. Way too loud to talk to anyone at your table. They are constantly blaring the most annoying pop music. So many screens surrounding the tables, so there are a lot of distractions from your company. Took forever for our drinks to come, and many of the orders were wrong. We weren't given water till our food came out 40 mins later. The food portions are way too big and quality is mediocre at best. Something as simple as french fries were undercooked, too crispy/stale and cold. You can usually tell when there are too many items on a menu that the food itself won't be good. Barely any vegetarian options. This is my second time at Tom's Urban (went to LA one and LV now). I won't be coming back unless I have no other choice."}
{"text":"First time - local to my hotel.  Sat inside by the bar and enjoyed great service.  Wasn't really hungry but went with a Cuban Sandwich that was pretty good this far from Little Havana.  Nice crowd watching some hockey and hoops."}
{"text":"This was the first stop on the \"not a bachelorette-bachelorette party,\" and it was a hit!   Drinks were strong, food was good, and the waiter handled our 6-person party well. I recall the brussels sprouts being particularly good, but everything on the menu was solid.  I would go back for appetizers and drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"Bad service. 15 min wait to clean our table when we were already sitting there.  Brussels sprouts were ok, nachos with very little cheese. And the worst is that draft beer was hardly cold!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was poor. Asked the server if they have any flavors for their iced coffee he looked at me irritated and said this is not starbucks. Asked for cheese on my eggs got cheese on my hash browns too. Very cheesy dish, but he got lucky I was hangover and a fan of cheese so I didn't mind.   Oh also their strawberry jelly was soooo good."}
{"text":"Great sports bar, good food, good service overall.  My group sat inside and had a great view of the games going on. Ordered and waited for about 20 to 30 min before getting our food which I would say is good timing based off how busy they were. Waitress was really good at filling up our drinks before they went empty. Overall if you want to watch a game and get a bite to eat I would suggest this as one of the places to go."}
{"text":"If your out on the strip this is a great place to stop and grab some food and/or drinks. Upscale atmosphere with a unique food menu, but don't let that scare you. The food is great and the customer service follows suit. Eddie was an awesome server with great suggestions off the menu. All the staff were upbeat and friendly. My wife and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were 1st comers here, I had a tree hugger Benedict with bacon & my boyfriend had a classic Benedict .They poached my eggs to perfection, everything had so much flavor in it . & everything was just very on point . I loved the view, we sat outside & had a great view . You get to see part of the strip . It was very busy but our server Carmen always made time to attend to us & see if we needed anything . She was super nice, friendly, & knew her stuff when it came to helping us decided what to eat on the menu. Carmen was awesome ! we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Great addition to the NYNY Casino. The location has an amazing looking patio that is just begging for Spring to get here. The food is simply delicious. Big flavours. Good portions. So far they are still working out the kinks as with any new restaurant opening, but it should prove to be a go-to spot. This is their third location in 2 years so clearly they are doing something right. The menu is a mixed bag of twists on different ethnic dishes like burritos and potstickers with some good American standards with Tom's Urban flair as the base. I've only seen the day menu so far, but supposedly their breakfast plates are to die for. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and BOTTOMLESS mimosas!!! Food had large portions. After an amazing breakfast on our first day with Shane, our bartender, we decided to come back for lunch the following day. Food was just as delicious and had another amazing time! Definitely recommend splitting food. But the drinks are poured strong, and coming from a bartender this is definitely a place I would recommend! Thanks again Shane! You were awesome!   GO BRONCOS"}
{"text":"This is a convenient spot when friends have been in town and we grab a bite. However, I think the food is mediocre at best.   It's a good location and patio is nice when the weather is warm-  to sit outside and people watch. The inside of the restaurant it cute too.   But the food is just so MEH. And I've been here  enough times to say that wholeheartedly. It's so underwhelming. We're had the steak nachos a million times. There's never any steak on them, the chips at the bottom are always dry. The pizzas look (and taste) like something I can make at home. The Kale Caesar is more like a romaine/ mixed green Caesar. Which is fine, but then specify that in the menu. Potstickers are  actually good though! I'm sure you get the point here and I don't need to list every item I've ever had. I think it's a bit overpriced for the quality of the food.   I will definitely say no to friends next time they suggest going here and will offer other places in the area that are wayyy better.   Ps. They do have bottomless mimosas which I need to try and I'm sure the food  will be better after that!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp and gave it the benefit of the doubt. Started off the meal with terrible service from the waitress. While in Vegas all I've been craving was buffalo wings so that's what I ordered. I ordered a drink during happy hour and waited for my food. When it arrived I received honey bbq wings and my Mac n cheese. I sent back the honey bbq because it wasn't what I ordered. When I finally got my buffalo wings they were all cold but the plate was hot to give you the illusion your food was warm I guess. Spoke to the manager and got that taken off my tab. After this the waitress completely ignored my table. When we were finally able to ask for our checks we get it back and they charged us the full price for our drinks that were on happy hour special. Be careful! The table next to us ALSO were charged full price for their drinks when it was during happy hour. We told our terrible waitress and got our tabs changed (again). We got our tabs back and finally my receipt was correct. However my friends tab upon receiving it had the happy hour price for his drinks but when he got his card back he was charged the full price.... sketchy! Needless to say I never do this but I left no tip. Sorry service, decent Mac n cheese, cold wings, utter disappointment, trendy ambiance, sketchy tabs! All in all make sure you check your receipts and hope you get warm wings and a warm plate! Oh did I forget to mention my friend found a hair in his Mac n cheese? Yeah... that happened. Gross."}
{"text":"Brunch with family. Had the garlic fries. Bird flew in. Was eh."}
{"text":"For me, restaurants are 90% about the food. And the rest doesn't matter much.   But I have to start this review with:  Arrived Sunday night. 8pm or so.  Hostesses were not friendly AT ALL.  Bitch faces, doing me a favour by seating me.  I think they thought they were really hot? Ugh - hostess attitude is the worst.  I'm asking you if I can give you my business.  And you greet me with THAT?  They seat us at a high top table. There were PLENTY of more comfortable open tables but whatever.   Food was decent if not overpriced.  Ordered wings and had a BBQ Jalapeño Burger.  Waitress was pleasant and competent.  Service was good.   I won't be back.  But probably you should put some friendly people outside your restaurant.  Update: stomach not enjoying the digestion of this meal at the moment."}
{"text":"Loved the tacos and garlic fries at the place. Actually everything is great!! Good portion sizes Interior is clean and welcoming.  The hostess was very sweet and polite. Our server, Michael, was absolutely brillant!! He helped us alot with the food and beer suggestions, and his suggestions were spot on... Thanks Michael for making our dining an absolutely worthy experience!! It was a pleasure talking with you. Will definitely visit again when in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is in the New York New York and it's a super cute modern place. I feel like I can't give a full review as we only came for breakfast and had the basics (eggs, bacon and hash browns). The music was good and uplifting (especially after a long night in Vegas).   Probably would have given them 4 stars had the waiters been a little nicer and faster. We didn't have much contact with the 2-3 waiters who helped up. The food took quite some time to come out. We both had the simplest of breakfasts and it didn't seem that busy.  Maybe it was just a one time flook. I loved the ambiance and the food was good so I'd probably give it another shot and even recommend to try it,"}
{"text":"20 minute wait when half of the restaurant was empty so we decided to sit at the bar. It took 5-10 mins for us to get menus (I had to ask for them). Our drink and food order took long as well. Finally, when we received our food..it was cold. I order a hot melted sandwich and the cheese was not even melted (still in slice form)....Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We went back to Tom's Urban and had a great time. The price did not change, and we still think it is a little high, but as far as service and the food being worth it.... YES!"}
{"text":"I only ordered mac and cheese to go. It was FANTASTIC! It was a yummy mac n cheese with carnitas and pico de gallo on top. It's a great combination!"}
{"text":"We went here because they show Gluten Free options on the menu outside ... There is no gluten free options on the menu I had to ask items I was interested in. My steak tacos were hard and chewy... My husbands breakfast toast tasted old... The food was cold.. But the fries were amazing.  We asked for the Manager and Dannie took care of our meal and offered to rwmake our food... I would try one more try..."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban was a great choice for dinner. My sister was in town visiting, and we had just left downtown and wanted a nice sit down spot to grab a late meal. We got there around 11:30pm on a Sunday, and it was not terribly busy so no wait. The atmosphere was great, and we enjoyed the variety of music (and accompanying music videos) being played. We were able to enjoy nice conversation and admire the unique art work and decor around our booth. The menu had quite a bit of variety and it looked like there were some really unique drink options and cocktails (although we didn't order any).  We are both health conscious eaters, and I follow a strict paleo diet so I was concerned about finding options that would work for me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered tacos in lettuce cups, and that's what each of us ordered. I got the Mahi Mahi tacos, and my sister got the Poached Shrimp & Lobster tacos- both were delicious! The Mahi Mahi was so juicy, well-seasoned and flavorful! There was a guacamole and pick de gallo mixed topping that was simple and not too spicy, but really added a great pop! With fresh orange and lime to squeeze over the tacos, they were perfectly zesty, sweet, and had a lot of texture (not to mention delicious)! The Hibiscus tea was really great and refreshing too. No sweetener necessary, and it still had a great taste and sweetness.  I had a large appetite, so I was left wanting more after my 3 tacos. They didn't come with a side, which would be my only complaint about the food. For the price, I would like to have a little bit larger portions or a side included with the meal.  But the service and time waiting for food were both quick, and our server was very friendly and helpful. I had some Mlife Rewards points available to use to pay for the meal, but for some reason they were unable to process that request, so we missed out on the perk of having earned a free meal from playing so much in the casino. That was a bummer but not a big deal, and our server was very friendly and apologetic about it.  Can't wait to try it again in the future!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. Our server emberly was amazing. Super accommodating and extremely nice. Next time we are in Vegas this is a go to spot!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and sat in the bar area. Despite not being busy, service was extremely slow. It took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come by and take our drink orders after being seated by the hostess. Throughout our meal, our waiter was non-existent, only stopping by to drop off our food and the bill.  After debating on order something off the brunch menu (offered daily) and a burger/sandwich, I decided on the Banh Mi burger. Although the toppings were fresh, just because you add Asian slaw, jalapenos, cucumbers, pickled onions, and cilantro to a burger doesn't make it a Banh Mi burger. The burger patty itself was cooked as ordered, was juicy, and had lots of flavor. However, it tasted just like a regular burger. The patty was pretty thick, so I felt the toppings got lost. Jalapenos were fresh so the burger definitely had a nice kick to it. I enjoyed the brioche bun, which wasn't overly buttered. This was a good regular burger...just not what I was expecting for a Banh Mi burger. I thought the garlic fries were okay. They had way too much garlic for my liking."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place near the tropicana and found Tom's. Good tree hugger eggs Benedict for breakfast (vegetarian). I had bacon added which was also good.  Also ordered urban breakfast platter. Came with cheesy hash browns. Breakfast sausage was tasty!"}
{"text":"Great fries, but really bad burgers... cool vibe, super nice staff but food needs to be better quality for this place to survive"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. My wife and I wandered in for breakfast about 8 am, and started with bottomless mimosas. She had the classic Eggs Benedict and I ordered the carnitas breakfast burrito. Portions were large, the food was very good, and our server filled up our drinks every time it got down to 1/3 left. It was a great start to the day - and we'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"First visit to this Las Vegas restaurant and we had the best server \"Mike\" who offered honest recommendations and was super attentive.  I ordered the fried chicken with pancake and it was delicious ... highly recommend it, along with their brined  fried chicken entree.  The chopped salad is huge and the Brussel Sprouts are addictive.  We would come again"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Las Vegas and I stayed at the New York New York hotel. Tom's Urban is located in this hotel. It was a Sunday in a tourist town so I expected it to be busy. However, people with the same amount of guests (3) in their party that got there after us were seated before us and we began to get irritated.   When we were seated, we waited over 20 minutes for a waitress to even greet us, let alone take our drink orders. It took us about two hours to get our food and eat, which was a little excessive. The waitress never checked in on us after taking our orders and bringing us our checks, and one of the people in my party didn't get everything she wanted on her burger.   The food was great, and the prices were relatively acceptable for the portion sizes, but the service makes me never want to go back. It wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great Comfort Food. A yummy twist on diner food.  We came in for Sunday brunch, which they serve till 4pm for the late to wake Vegas crowd. The full lunch menu is also available. We split an omelette with cheesy hash browns and sour dough toast.  The portions were ample but not overwhelming.  The coffee is strong and our server kept our cups full.  I'd pass on the OJ not worth the $4.50 for an 8oz glass.  Tastes like it comes from a carton. Overall a pleasant brunch."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The restaurant just opened yesterday (12/29/14) but I could already tell that this is the spot to be! My boyfriend and I got tired of gambling and wanted to have a late night snack (if you call it a snack) but didn't feel like fast food. We are done walking and after a few beers/drinks at the slot machines there's no way we are driving anywhere. I know it's Vegas baby but still after all day walking from one casino to the next I'm pooped! We stumbled upon this spot coz it seems like they're still serving food and yup we were in luck coz they were! We were so happy we didn't even care to look at the menu before going in (we had no idea what kind of food they served) I thought for a second that it was a mexican restaurant coz of the hot sauce on the tables but the siracha threw me off though! Could it be Chinese? Ahhhh so the friendly hostess sat us and gave us the menu. They have burgers, tacos, sandwiches, breakfast items from pancakes to omelette and shakes as well (with alcohol may I add). So it's not Chinese after all hahaha. I ordered the filet mignon steak with eggs and toast. My boyfriend ordered the portobello mushroom swiss burger and garlic fries. And I did try to order a chocolate shake but their shake machine has not arrived yet (that's how new this place is) no biggie I can live without the shake. The food was great! My steak was cooked medium rare as I requested and melted in my mouth. My boyfriends burger was cooked medium and he ate it in less than 10 minutes. He said its one of the best burgers he had. He's a burger lover so I'll take his word for it. Over all the foods great, the service was great and we will definitely come back to eat here again when we come back to Sin City!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for years, so we finally did this trip. We had to wait a little for outside seating but we played some games out in the New York New York area and it went quick. We were seated and then it goes down hill a bit...We asked for the flavor of the homemade pop tarts and she didn't know. She said she would check and took our drink orders. She came back with drinks but states she forgot to go to kitchen..We ordered our food and told her we still wanted to know and would add them if we liked the flavor. She left and we NEVER SAW HER AGAIN for at least 30 minutes. Our food came out (by someone else) and then she showed up about 10min later. WE ASKED HER AGAIN and she goes..\" Oh Blueberry\"..Why on earth would we have to be the ones to ask her again and 10 min after we already had our food. So anyway we didn't try them which was disappointing but the other food was good. The beach bum omelet was delicious. The lunch items we saw going by looked great. We will definitely give it a try 1 more time and hope for better service."}
{"text":"We visited while in the New York New York casino, great atmosphere and our waiter was very attentive and offered great recommendations. You could tell he was excited about not only his job but the food, which is awesome to see. We had a few of the mixed drinks on the menus, some local craft beers, and for dinner the pepperoni pizza & burger with fried egg/onion strip on it. Both meals were amazing and fulfilling, burger cooked well and very juicy. Even though we didn't try any of the other eclectic items on the menu, we left very satisfied and had fun!"}
{"text":"The price for unlimited mimosas are a little steep but offer great juice choices. Eggs Benedict was awesome. Hash browns mediocre. Wait staff - awesome!!"}
{"text":"I am stumped by the amazing food and service at this restaurant! When you go to Las Vegas, you become used to subpar food/service and are usually treated like a minuscule fish in an enormous pond. When I stumbled across Toms Urban, I was actually stunned by the quality of food. Better than the MANY restaurants I've tried in Vegas by a long shot. Extremely good service to top it off. If you end up anywhere near the NY NY hotel, do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Average place.  Slow service.  Not impressed with the food either.   Not coming back."}
{"text":"A little disappointing.  Asked to turn on misters and they said it was broken and walked away.  Food a little too over cooked and drinks were meh.  Customer service lacking our server didn't even smile once."}
{"text":"Had the best time at Tom's tonight ... with no disrespect ... the best employee was the Bar back... his name was Bleu... he made it the most comforting and enjoyable time ... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Made a morning reservation for 10:30am and when the waitress came, she told us that we couldn't order omelettes because there was an issue with that station and the wait was up to 40 minutes. We changed our orders to accommodate what the waitress stated and waited. After 30 minutes we asked about our order and she said they were backed up. After 45 minutes the waitress came back and said our ticket was \"almost up\". At this point it was after 11:30 and the tables around us surprisingly enough were getting their orders. At this point I requested to speak to a manager and he immediately came up and apologized and stated he would take a discount from our check. 15 minutes later our food arrived, but from the 3 orders, all of them were cold. When finished the waitress informed us that our check had been taken care of by the manager. Also, while we were eating the table that was seated next to us that came in about 35 minutes after had a big fluffy omelette delivered. Needless to say we appreciated the waived bill and left. Definitely would recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location! Awesome stripside patio! Breakfast served all day. The Three Pig Omelette was possibly the best omelette I've ever had. The cheesy hash browns were sooo good! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Ok i had a chance to go back to Toms Urban to try it out again..Compliments of Doug Winter..I want to thk you Doug for getting back to me and giving me another chance to try out Toms..Im glad you did nad im glad i went back..I never had a problem with the food..the food was awesome...gotta try the sin city burger and the wings or one of the best wings i have ever tasted. Anyways this review is not about the food, we already know the food is good. Its about the service and overall experience. I want to say the service was top notch..Veronica, our server, was on top of it and brought was everything we needed. She came by our table asking if we needed anything and didnt ignore us. Doug Winter..thk you again and i will definitely be coming back to Toms again."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I couldn't help but try others food because of the appeal they have. They were able to accommodate a large party and in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The beers came AFTER our food. It's a Thursday and not crowded. The mahi mahi tacos taste like frozen fish sticks and the green sauce is so spicy it hurts. Seriously. Don't waist your time."}
{"text":"The food and service was great!  I was really fond of the hotdog I got really big and good.  Our server Jose was very friendly and his service was very prompt! Overall I would definitely came back to eat at this establishment"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with best veggie omelet and cheesy hash browns.  If eating with friends consider sharing the lemon blueberry pancakes. Very good service too. Rosa was our server but I think they're all great. Better yet is the cost.. extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. We woke up early on a Saturday after a long night to hit the strip before it got really busy. We were on a mission for bloody mary's and breakfast. Tom's Urban was across the street from our condo so it was a perfect location. We arrived and the hostess was this adorable gal whom I didn't catch the name of, but she was bubbly and fun. She sat us on the patio and brought us water. Our waitress arrived and took our drink order. She was able to give us recommendations on what the most popular drinks were or what she prefers. We got our first round of drinks, and my only complaint was that my bloody mary wasn't spicy enough. They didn't have a huge selection of hot sauces, but we made due. The bloody mary mix is house made and delicious. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict with the cheddar polenta grits. The grits were amazing. Super flavorful and creamy. The benedict was delicious and the eggs were poached to perfection. It was the perfect breakfast to start our day. We were all more than satisfied. The service and the food were both on point to our expectations, and I will most definitely visit on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast meal on Day #4 of our March Madness in Las Vegas trip with Mr. Booth, Mr. Bloewen, and Buxton.  Although Buxton was too hungover to drink, and he doesn't really eat any solid food, the others all had a meal.  Mr. Bloewen and I had a breakfast burrito each.  When they first came out, the first thought was, \"We both could have shared this!\"  However, it was so good, that we both ate it ourselves.  This is saying a lot, since Mr. Bloewen rarely finishes his food!  Mr. Booth made his own omelette and also seemed to enjoy it.  Best part of the meal was the $20 all you can drink mimosa's (until 2pm).  I still have no idea how we were able to drink so many of them after the prior 3 days of booze, but we did rally.  Big time...  Our server was fantastic, as we never had an empty glass.  She even gave us large \"to-go\" cups for a final mimosa that took me quite a while to finally put back.  I gladly will come here for breakfast next time I am in the area, and prefer this over the champagne brunch buffets.  If you check in on Yelp, they will give you an order of fried pickles or brussel sprouts.  Unfortunately, I don't like either.  But, since Boothie loves his pickles, Buxton insisted that we order a serving.  They were good, but nobody really ate them.  Recommended for a breakfast / brunch meal!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night. I had the steak tacos and they were small but very tasty. Service was good and my waiter who i believe name was Sean was awesome. I was able to reserve a table and had no issues upon arrival. Very wide food selection available. Will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was going on when I went there because it looks to have decent reviews. I ordered the Carnitas Cuban Sandwich and waitress said she needed to check to see but they may have run out of carnitas. She checked and came back with good news...carnitas in stock. Meal came and I noticed they decided to swap in crumbled bacon because they had in fact run out of carnitas. Why would you not just tell me to order something else?!  Also wife got eggs Benedict and they served it with a hard boiled egg on top. Never again for this place."}
{"text":"AVOID UNLESS YOU ARE HERE FOR A DRINK. we got avocado shrimp salad and sin city burger. Beef patty was disgusting so as brioche ( cheap imitation of brioche ). BBQ sauce is probably from 99cents store. Sweet potato fries is absolutely and definitely pre frozen from a supermarket. ITS TASTELESS. Salad is even worth. Shrimps were JUST BOILED. no seasoning , or anything. Boiled tasteless shrimps. Bunch of spinach, way too much dressing and yeah, 2 slices of Avocado. Guess they should change the name and take Avocado off the name. Disappointed. Service girl was good tho, very friendly and pleasant. And she is the only reason this place gets 2stars."}
{"text":"Easily accessible. Right in front of New York New York. Outside Seating. Friendly staff. Went at midnight and it was not too busy. Definitely recommend the pineapple cider. Had the lobster roll with garlic fries, duck wings, and lobster&shrimp mac and cheese. Good portions. good quality. sauce on the duck wings were delicious. Plan on coming back for breakfast and getting endless mimosas!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this five stars because our server Miranda was AMAZING. I can honestly say I have never in my 33 years had a better server. She was so patient with the 13 people I came in with, half of which were seniors, and she had the cutest and sweetest disposition. When the cooks messed up once she totally fixed it and took it off the bill. She even gave one of us free fries, too, for waiting. Oh, and the food was also delicious. Everyone loved their burgers, and I thoroughly enjoyed my jumbo fried shrimp and garlic shoestring fries. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Vegas at the New York."}
{"text":"The staff was courteous and food was great! I definitely recommend breakfast it's affordable and delicious"}
{"text":"Pancakes!!!!  I don't write a lot of reviews. Service thus far in Vegas has been sub par. Sean took care of us this morning and that is what we've been missing. Great job and Kudos!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Tom Urban in Las Vegas.. The Happy Hour specials were great!! The spicy brussel sprouts and spicy edamme beans were great!! Our was Maggie.. She was great!! Her attention to detail was phenomenal!! I will come back just for her friendly caring attitude!! I recommend Tom Urban to anyone visiting Vegas!!"}
{"text":"After a long day with the wedding we were in we all decided to meet up at the Bride and Grooms resort for a night cap and appetizers.  We were sat on the patio with a great view of the strip but that's where the fun ends.  Our server was a jerk.  He handed us menus with a happy our listed so we decided to order a couple of drinks from that.  I think it was 1 min past the time or something but he made a snarky comment about the time and that we can no longer order from the happy hour menu.  I ordered a beer and the wife ordered a mixed drink.  We also wanted to order an appetizer but it took forever for the server to come back.  Once he did we ordered the fried pickles.  We checked in on Yelp and we were given a coupon for fried pickles.  I'm not a guy that's always looking for a deal but if I have one I am going to use it.  When we got our bill the total was over $35 for 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and pickles that were in a tiny little metal serving dish.  I gave the server my yelp coupon only to get another snarky comment about how that expired in April and he's tired of people trying to use it.  I'm sorry dude.  I JUST checked in and your coupon popped up.  He said he would honor it if I went on Yelp and left him a great review.  Here's the thing.  Your service was terrible.  We all had 1 drink because you never came back.  No you do not get a great review.  Next time we are in Vegas we will skip this joint."}
{"text":"We had a coupon,  so we headed to the bar for our huge beer! Daniel was an outstanding bartender who dresses exceptionally well and takes pride in himself and his work. We enjoyed our time there and cannot wait to come back and try some food!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service. I came by myself this morning. Was seated and it wasn't even busy. 15 minutes go by no one comes over. Finally someone comes over and asks if I want anything to drink. I ask for water and another 15 minutes goes by and I finally get water. I place my order and it comes out. I have no napkin. I am finally brought over a napkin after asking. My water glass remained empty my entire meal no one ever stopped by. I flagged down the girl and asked for my check. Never again. Go somewhere else if you want basic customer service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place for brunch.  It was just like every other breakfast places, your eggs, bacon and tater place.  Minus, our \"lovely\" waitress who spoke with a very strong accent told us they were out of potatoes so we had a side salad with our brunch (breakfast).  After our food came out every other table that was seated after us received tators with their breakfast.... We will not be back.  We will explore other places."}
{"text":"From the get go as soon as I checked in I got an offer for free fried pickles or brussel sprouts *SCORE* We were casually walking around for a good place to have breakfast- we saw this place with outside seating and with the beautiful day we are having it was SO INVITING. So we walked in and ordered a table. The guy in the front super friendly, our waitress very friendly and attentive. Very extensive menu, everything looked and sounded amazing so it was hard to choose. We opted to stay under the Breakfast/Brunch menu although the entire menu was open before 10am! Even the apple juice was served in awesome glasses. The fried pickles were very good, not greasy and fried to perfection (not burnt, not soggy). The only negative was the wait time. The restaurant was not full and it still took about 30min. The french toast was amazing- no need for syrup. The hash browns with melted cheese were really good too. I rarely leave food but it was a lot of food-needless to say big portions. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Tacos, nachos, sliders.. things that are always good no matter what. NOT HERE. 16 bucks per dish literally almost made me vomit after two bites of the \"Mahi mahi\" tacos. Tasted like frozen fish sticks out of the grocery store but half the size of a fish stick, like fish stick chicken nuggets, stuck in a dry tortilla with a few sprinkles of cabbage. Fake steak on the nachos, gross melted cheese. I'd much rather have the nachos you get from a high school basketball game then wonder what this was I stuck in my mouth. Sliders bun was like an old McDonald's bun. Everything here was fake. How can they call themselves a restaurant when they serve no real food. The worst food I can remember having. And I'm not exaggerating. This is literally like my first Yelp review. I often think about doing positive reviews when restaurants thrive in outstanding customer service and exquisite food but am to lazy to actually do it. I am simply making this review as a caution to everyone out there to not step foot in this restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, menu seems good and then you get your \"food\" and I'd rather just starve for 4 days."}
{"text":"Part of the newest wing at NYNY. Found they were open for breakfast and stepped across the bridge to check 'em out. Doug had the All American with sausage -- pretty tasty. I had carnitas burrito. Pretty visually but mainly filled with rice and rolled too skinny do all you taste is tortilla.   Very clean open space. Similar to the one at LA Live.   Overall, a nice addition to the food landscape at NYNY."}
{"text":"I read about this place on fb newsfeed so i decided to try breakfast here..i got a great seat outside with view of the strip..i ordered the tree hugger eggs benedict which has avocados, poached eggs n tomatoes..comes with cheesy hashbrowns..english muffin was hard to cut thru n could've had more hollandaise sauce on top..hashbrowns were good..i also tried their take on a cherry pop tart..it was good but it could've been better if it was warm..overall food was ok but since i had friendly service which i think is important..i will give them another go n try lunch instead"}
{"text":"Everything we ate here was really good, loved the cornbread pancake. Unfortunately, the Backyard Lemonade and the Mojito-jito were both horrible and tasted like soda that's losing its carbonation. Food was good enough to come back but definitely wouldn't spend $14 a piece of drinks again."}
{"text":"If you like pork belly, or if you have never tried it,  this is your place.  The the tacos are ridiculously good. They also have Speak easy ale which goes great with the taco."}
{"text":"04/09/17  Decided to grab something to eat on a Sunday night at the New York New York Casino. It was close to midnight.  All of the other restaurants around the market were already closed except this one.    Kudos to our server Ruth who provided a great dining experience to us first timers.    My wife and I ordered the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Cheese, and the Prime Rib Sliders.   Crispy Brussels Sprouts (v) - Red peppers, Asian vinaigrette  At first we thought is was just your ordinary Brussels Sprouts until I took a sprout deep inside the bowl.  I took my first bite and thought, \"What the hell is that?!\"  I noticed that the Asian vinaigrette was sitting at the bottom and sprouts that soaked in more of this sauce took the flavor to another level.  I asked my wife to try it again with more sauce and she agreed.    Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Cheese - creamy mac & cheese with butter-poached lobster & shrimp  This is a very big portion!  A great serving size for 2 people. Once it hits your table you can see the shrimp and lobster sitting on top of the creamy macaroni.  It is a very filling dish and tastes great right off the line.  I would recommend eating it as soon as you get it so the cheese stays creamy and doesn't thicken up during your meal.  Prime Rib Sliders - Slow roasted & shaved prime rib topped with beef rosemary demi-glace, natural Havarti cheese, crispy haystack onions  You get 3 sliders with this order,  It can be a meal for 1 person or good for sharing with 2.  It was a tiny bit on the greasy side for us, but since we had the Brussels Sprouts it all worked out.  I would like to try the other options of sliders on their menu before ordering this again. With that said, this was an okay dish for us.    Overall, I give this place a 4 for the dishes and the service that was provided. I would like to go back there and try out the other items they have to offer.  This is based on our experience and our palette. So your taste buds might say otherwise."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service  Lobster roll with garlic fries -didn't really taste the truffle but it was still a delicious chunks of lobster meat suspended in mayonnaise,  the bread was a nice soft brioche, which made the sandwich very easy to eat -garlic fries were just ok,  not as flavorful as what the other reviews had made it seem like.  It may have been just a dash of garlic oil  Brussel sprouts - amazing! Best deep fried Brussel sprouts I've ever had!  Flavorful sauce, perfectly crisp but not burnt sprouts,  and good portion size  Honey bbq chicken sliders -pretty tasty although the bread could have been toasted more,  and was just a little stale/cold for my taste.   Although the sliders were breast meat,  it was not dry, and you can't go wrong with honey bbq  Honey bbq chicken wings -we were given this on the house due to a misunderstanding,  pretty standard for wings.  Overall, this is a solid place if you're people watching on a cooler evening on the strip"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with a friend. Wait staff was upbeat and friendly.. the foorld was incredible.. blueberry pancakes, veggie omelette, homemade cherry pop tarts, delicious toast.. endless mamosas.. this was a great experience, the price wasnt so bad either for being on the strip! The interrior ilhas a nice design witg cool seating arrangements. I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Searching for a restaurant still open past midnight during the week and was winning when we came into this location. Food was excellent. The Mac and cheese was very good, but mine is better . The lobster and shrimp tacos were to die for and we will be returning for them later this week! Our server, Tim, was very helpful even though they were taking last call on drinks and food around 1am. Only down side (of course) is expensive drinks. $22 bloody mary ."}
{"text":"My fiance and I needed a quick bite before heading to the airport and Tom's Urban was the closest high reviewed place near us. We were having an early dinner, so they were offering their happy hour menu. We ordered tacos (pork and chicken - $4 each), pork baos ( $4 for 2 baos), and the split order of fries. The tacos were nothing special and the pork was dry. The baos were just off, the pork belly was hard and the bao (which is normally soft) had a rough consistency on the outside. The only memorable thing about this meal was the garlic fries - those we really good. Skip the sweet potato fries and just go for the garlic ones.  Service was great though."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience! I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon shortly after landing in Las Vegas. I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty!   Well first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me.   Secondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible.   The waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse.   The mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn't think logically. This place has got to get it together."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better places I ate at in Vegas. Was there for a conference and on our longest day we had a two hour gap for lunch and were sick of the options and lines in the three main connected hotels that most conference attendees were staying in (that may or may not have been right across an outdoor walkway). We stepped up to Tom's on a whim and after a quick glance at the menu, we decided why not. Went with a group of 4, informed them we were in a bit of a hurry and they assured us their kitchen would be able to whip up the food quickly (and they did!).   Three of the four of us wound up with brunch, and one went with a lunch sandwich and we were all really pleased with our food. I got a build your own omelet, with the sourdough toast and the asiago hashbrown (which I highly recommend!). The food was cooked perfectly, exactly as I specified, and was hot and fresh. The serving was very large, definitely worth every penny of the cost. I got a latte, was better than your average diner coffee, but I could take it or leave it. The waitress we had was a sweetheart, and she split our bill without an issue. The restaurant was clean and true to their word, we were in and out with time to spare. Probably one of the better options at New York New York."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would! Disgusting! Ok, so Yelp is requiring me to write more. We asked for a table to relax, they gave us a bar table the size of a dinner plate. Two minutes later they open the comfortable seating/table section. Then, ordered BBQ Wings and Honey Wings that must have been dropped in coating over and over, when I scrapped the coating and bit into the chicken, I had to spit it out. Ok enough said! Not going back again, Urban = Gangsta! Not well managed!"}
{"text":"Location, location! With a patio overlooking the Strip and the \"Brooklyn Bridge\", this place seems like it would be super popular and busy. We were there during happy hour and sat on the patio. There were a few other tables filled but it was not busy. The happy hour menu was meh so I had the Benedict with hash browns. It's nice to be able to order breakfast for dinner! The meal was good but not quite hot enough. The sauce could've been tastier too.  We enjoyed the videos which were pretty much right above us at our nice corner table. Some bevvies are $5 during happy hour, but I chose the Tom's Big One (beer option) a 33 ouncer of Lienenkugel Oktoberfest. At $15, the Big One is a nice option to have, and a semi bargain as well. I noticed the menu showed Tom's giant martini glass photo op inside the casino and offered a free printed photo via social media. Our server didn't know about it and asked a manager who told her the printer wasn't working. Boo!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor was really nice. Good tunes playing in the background. Service was decent. Portions were large but taste was so so. Was really disappointed in the taste of the food. Probably won't be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a go on the last trip to Vegas.  The wife and I decided to stick to the small plate section because the choices looked pretty good.  We ordered duck wings, chicken pot stickers, buffalo chicken sliders, fillet mignon sliders, and shoestring fries.  So the food came out pretty quickly and  it was pretty good.  Our favorite was definitely the buffalo chicken sliders.  The filet mignon sliders had to be my least favorite.  I found that the meat was a little tough.  The reason why I gave three stars is because 5 small plates and 2 soda's came out to $80 which seemed a little steep, even by Vegas standards.  I really wanted to try to the taco's but it was 3 taco's for close to $17.  So this is in the middle.  Good food, not so great price"}
{"text":"Mac n cheese is amazing...cheesy, spicy, with the pork for an extra surprise-- delish!!!, the Brussel sprouts rocked..if you didn't like them before...you will change your mind--crispy, charred with Asian influence... .amazing. Filet mignon sliders ok....but pricey..Great atmosphere. Highly recommend. Steven was our bartender...he was awesome---great recommendations and outstanding service!!! Plus the Blackhawks won in triple overtime...what more can you ask for????"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. It's fun to sit outside for breakfast in Vegas in the spring. But my food, albeit tasty, came out cold. Both the server and manager addressed it with me and were apologetic. I will still come back and give it another chance but I was hoping for more! In a town that is not especially warm in its hospitality, I was pleased (they discounted my cold breakfast burrito). A for effort!!!"}
{"text":"Expected foodie hipster, received subpar Applebees. Ordered breakfast burritos, just meat and plain eggs inside cold flour tortilla with a little salsa and pre-frozen goat cheese on top. Pork thick, hard chunks not shredded like waitress said."}
{"text":"Tom's Urban is always a stop for us when in Vegas. We love the bottomless mimosas! Our server Nate made sure they were always full. And the food is  the grilled cheese and fig jam is my fave!"}
{"text":"What a delightful breakfast! Okay, I'm done. Just kidding! It was a great breakfast, nice portions. I had the veggie omelet, hash browns and sourdough toast. We also tried the homemade pop tarts. Flaky crust, loved it! It was my first time, and since breakfast is the one meal I definitely eat I'm always looking for a delicious breakfast. They serve Peet's coffee, and it will wake you up!  Now I normally eat breakfast at Hexx (formerly the Sugar Factory) every time I'm in Vegas. But this place definitely gives them a run for the money. Bonus they have nice patio seating. Perfect for people watchers like myself.   Service was good. Everyone was really nice and attentive (I'm big on service, a former server myself! My college jobs). Bad service automatically drops to three stars regardless of the food.  Nice decor.   Ambiance!   I definitely will be back. I have to try the Mac and cheese before I leave."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and food. Beware: the portions are HUGE. I would recommend the bacon avocado omelet and hash browns and the lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes. While there were only two of us, this could have fed four people! You get well more than what you pay for. Overall, a must if you're looking for brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here at 130 am after arriving in Vegas late. They have quite the eclectic menu and they're open late. They had good food and our server was very nice and accommodating. I had the Chicago dog with a salad it was huge! My friend had breakfast (yes they still served breakfast) and her eggs and hash browns with cheese were yummy!"}
{"text":"Havent tried the food yet but went to the one in los angeles and saw one here in vegas and tried it.. Cool spot and perfect to hang out on the outside bar.."}
{"text":"I wish Tom's Urban had come up on my yelp search for New York, New York before I left for Vegas. It would have saved me a lot of time when I had just flown in and was starving. Luckily I ended up spotting it while walking down the street and decided to give it a try for brunch. It's really nice to sit outside on the patio and people watch while you're eating. I had french toast with a side of friends, and my friend had the omelette. Both were quick to come out and tasty. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. Had one of the omelettes for brunch. Extra tasty and mega portions."}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Friday. We were told that there were no tables in the main area without reservation and were fine sitting at a booth by the bar. However when we looked inside there were plenty of empty tables.   The service wasn't too great. We initially had one waitress. But then her shift was over so another waiter took over. The food took forever to come out and there were mistakes on 2 of the orders so those had to be remade and the fries were cold. They were pretty nice about it and kept making sure we were okay after that.   The food was okay, nothing special. I had the create your own omelette with sausage, avocado and goat cheese. The hash browns that it came with were really good. My friend ordered the blueberry pop tart and it wasn't good. We ordered the frozen Moscow mule. I love Moscow mules, it's my favorite drink, so I was excited to try this version. I was disappointed, it was good but def not a mule. It tasted more like a margarita.  The menu has a lot of options and the descriptions were pretty cool because it was like a funny story. My friend enjoyed reading all of it like it was a book."}
{"text":"Eddie rocks! This place is bumping what th music and great vibe! Drinks and menu for everyone!"}
{"text":"I honestly think I need to give this place another try but I think I went on an off night , however with that said I would say that place is pretty much a Denny's or a step above with edm playing really loud. The food was good I had a big chicken burrito and my girlfriend had the buffalo chicken sliders . I thought mine was good but I think I've made better. I really do recommend the buffalo chicken sliders tho they are small but filling and seem the be whole chicken not processed ."}
{"text":"Had the figgy piggy which was a little heavy on he cheese and hardly any fig. Still tasty with a $20 bottomless mimosa special which allows you to take the last one to-go!  Our server was unfortunately very slow and extremely aloof like perhaps the edibles caught up with her. Otherwise still worth it to go in and have 3 mimosas seated and take 1 to go."}
{"text":"Favorite Part: Great beer selection, especially the local options!   Food: Had the shrimp and avocado salad which was good, except it was served on a plate so my lettuce was spilling all over because there was so much lettuce. Maybe I'm just sloppy, but it would be much better suited in a big bowl! And like I said, lettuce to \"good stuff\" ratio was off. Flavors were good though, especially the fried capers.  Atmosphere: The place is way bigger than I thought it was, but kind of spread out into sections, so I actually really liked the vibe. Nice decor, big bar, great location right on the strip. There is outdoor seating as well.  Service: Just ok. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about except my beer was forgotten right in the beginning of our time there.  I will go back to drink probably, and I would like to try some new things, but not my favorite spot as of yet."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. Drinks weren't to strong which isn't good in Vegas. Was thrown off with all the pigeons in the outside area. Crispy Brussel sprouts were decent, needed season."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food was mediocre. Our server got the order wrong and argued with us that it was right."}
{"text":"Unfortunately there isn't a \"0\" rating available on YELP. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service starting with the hostess and ending with waiters. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Eddie and Emmanuel were amazing and attentive servers for our large party, the food was fast and delicious! I highly recommend the crispy brussels and fried pickles!! Cocktails were top notch! Definitely coming back on our next Vegas trip!"}
