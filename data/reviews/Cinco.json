{"text":"Excellent food and service!  The pineapple and pork tacos were outstanding. Chips were crisp and salsa was fresh. Glad to have a great Mexican restaurant in the South Hills."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us went to Cinco on a Tuesday night, and the restaurant was about half full. A hurried waitress eventually came to the table saying she had been called in because they only had one person on staff that night and the bar tender was now helping to serve food. It took more than 30 minutes for the first round of drinks to arrive at the table, after we asked about them twice. One of the six had ordered an appetizer for her entree and it came out ahead of the other food about 15 minutes later, and it was cold and awful (empanadas). At this point we were considering leaving. Another 10 minutes or so passed and the rest of the food came out. We also told the waitress that the appetizer came out cold and she asked if we wanted to send it back. We did not have another hour to wait for the food to be remade. The rest of the food was pretty good though! Among us, we had burritos, tacos, etc. and we all enjoyed the food. When the bill came, I would have thought they might take off the appetizer given the wait and it was cold, but no such luck. Better service would have led to a much better review. The waitress was very nice, but it did not make up for the long wait and food that was good, but certainly not great. Also, I know this place has changed restaurants multiple times over the years, but it does not appear have been renovated in the least."}
{"text":"Lots of choices on the menu.  Good for the family.  We all really enjoyed the food and the margaritas were good, too."}
{"text":"Yummy!    Tortilla chips were warm and crisp - not from a bag.  We had the guacamole which I found smooth, fresh and a great start with cocktails.  The menu is proof that they are really trying to combine traditional flavors with innovative combinations.  We had the Chile en nogada Tehuacan and Camarones Cozumel.  Both were really delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try more!  I am a fan of ingredients that work and speak for themselves and these dishes did not disappoint.  If you consider Chipotle and Chi Chi's as good Mexican food you will be disappointed, but if you are a foodie looking for some new and exciting cuisine in the South Hills I highly recommend Cinco!"}
{"text":"Service was good, the food/drinks came out in a very timely manner. They give you lots for the price/very good quality food. Nothing was over seasoned and everything was served very hot which is how I like my food! Very pleased with it over all :)"}
{"text":"I love their food!! all of it is good....I have tried over 90% of the things on their menus including the soups and I love it all. Word of warning though, the margaritas are strong!"}
{"text":"Good tasting bean soup & chick-pea soup. Service was relatively quick."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Their food is so good and authentic. The location kind of stinks (only because we've seen the restaurant change hands often throughout the years), but I hope they last. Good, good food!"}
{"text":"I think this place has closed. No cars there for the last few days and their phone number doesn't seem to work anymore."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night.  This is a kid friendly place, for those with children. Although there was a screaming 1 yr old that made things a bit unbearable for a short time, but that's not the fault of the restaurant.  We got a table in a dark corner of the restaurant.  Had a nice waiter who was knowledgeable and friendly.  I had the Michelada, which is like a Bloody Mary with beer.  Be sure to give this a really good stir before you pour the entire beer in, otherwise it will be very salty and spicy.  Its different, I'd order it again.  For the main, I got the Puerco en Salsa Verde.  It was excellent.  Very flavorful and off the beaten path from most Mexican restaurants.  My bf had the La Parrilla skillet.  He thought it was good, but didn't think it was that anything special.  This place is close, so I would come here again.  Give it another go."}
{"text":"We were excited for this new little Mexican addition to the south side.  The service here is inattentive at best. We were left sitting at our table forever. No one seemed to know whose table was whose, nor did they seem to care. We finally asked for wait staff to bring us water, cutlery and a menu. Not good for a new place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on three occasions within the last month. Two have been with Groupon deals. The food has been better than average, I have had the fish tacos, chicken chimichanga and the poblano peppers.  My wife is a fan of the cheese enchiladas and my son really enjoys the chicken quesadillas.. Over all the place is pretty good. In the south hills there is a serious lack of mexican food, this restaurant is a nice addition that everyone in the family enjoys."}
{"text":"Finally a good local Mexican restaurant with homemade food. From the chips to the margaritas and everything in between it was good! And a great value. It  is also nice to support an individual restaurant owner over the chains. Exceptional service, too. Very casual."}
{"text":"Ok,  given that I'm the first to reject an offer to Cinco it is time to update this review.  Nice people, food not bad, but there is more exciting stuff out there."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening, and initially only a few others at the restaurant.   We were seated quickly, but had to wait about 10 minutes to have anyone bring menus or drinks.  Once someone showed up, service was quick with bringing drinks.  We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Food and appetizer came out at the same time, very quickly, but wouldn't have ordered the chips had we known they would bring them with our dinner. I love Mexican food, and have never had chips and salsa that was bad...until now!  They were so bland, I had 1 taste and yuck!  Tried one more and still  awful.  Salsa was without taste, just substance.  Chips were rubbery. I had 3 tacos (shredded chicken) beans and rice.  It was not good.  Shredded chicken was not very shredded, mostly big chunks and spiced hot, but no flavor.  Rice and beans were adequate.  All very bland.  My husband and I both said  a few minutes into the meal Taco Bell is better.   No one ever returned to the table.  No drink refills, ( taco's were hot and finished drink after 1st one). And then when we were done could not get anyone to come by with bill.  Kept signaling waiter, put on coats, stood up with arms crossed and keys in hand, no one came by.   After 15 minutes or so, went to cash register and paid.  The guy who checked us out apologized that we had to come to  cash register, and was very nice.   Disappointed, restaurant is close by and would have went frequently.  But food is  bland, and service was terrible."}
{"text":"Oh, Cinco. What a disappointment. I went on a Friday evening with the boyfriend. The restaurant was full of older couples dining and high school kids working. It reeked of booze and cigarette smoke. Although I didn't see anyone smoking inside, there were some patrons with cigarette packs, so I'm not surprised at the smell.  We were seated at a table awkwardly set in front of the hallway to the kitchen, so people were walking past our table constantly--not very intimate. The hostess was nice enough, but she handed a menu to my date first--isn't the rule \"ladies first?\" Maybe he looked hungry.  Charging for chips and salsa? Super tacky. My strawberry margarita wasn't bad, but it started tasting very salty about halfway through. The meal was good--no complaints about the food. It was nice and uncomplicated. We spent about $50 for chips and salsa, two entrees and two margaritas. That price would be appalling back home in Texas, but that's another conversation. Sorry, Cinco, but I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place for a while, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had a taco salad, husband had a burrito and kids had a quesadilla. Yes, you have to buy the chips and salsa as someone else stated, but I do not know why this would be a problem?? Every restaurant I have been to, you have to buy the appetizer (they are only $2.50). Our food was excellent and our service was fast! We were in and out in less than 45 minutes. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been eager to try Cinco having lived in Mexico for a few months and having traveled there many times. After reading so many negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it was crowded and the service was a bit slow, but overall the whole experience was good.  It is definitely not your typical Pittsburgh/Mexican menu. There is no list of 50 combination platters, which is good thing in my book. And there are a variety of dishes beyond the standards you can find on every Mexican menu in the area.  I had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. Very tasty. The one disappointing dish was the sopa azteca. Despite listing garnishes on the menu, the soup did not come with them."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting restaurants in a chain saturated township.  THANK YOU CINCO for being here!  Always great service, great food, great liquor.  Unlike the ubiquitous chains in USC, this restaurant has unique items on their menu.  Where else are you getting Chiles en Nogales?(the best I have ever had),  Fajitas with a great tasting Chorizo, Chicken fried steak with lemon sauce ,fabulous tender pulled pork with green sauce ??? I am pleased to have a restaurant with food familiar to me that is made well and close to home.    Cinco is where our family goes for a great meal at a reasonable price.  We have tried Fridays (disgusting food, watered drinks), Houlihans (horrible rude people, all industrial), Dragon Fire (we like), and also forth.  Ultimately, Cinco is the go to restaurant for consistently good food where we can bring our family, have a nice dinner and a strong margarita without breaking the bank.  MY FAMILY FAVS:  (Cinco names these dishes with special names that I can't remember)  Chiles en Nogales (Possibly called Chiles Techeuan).  Dark green mildly spicy but savory green pepper stuffed with sweet ground pork, peaches, pine nuts and spices covered in a walnut crème sauce.  primo!!  Puerco en Chile Verde:  succulent pulled pork topped with a lemony green Chile sauce served with all the toppings (including tortillas).  Stuff those tortillas with the yummy goodness of the pork I swear only Mexicans can cook correctly! My second most craving.  Fajitas with steak, shrimp and Chorizo.  My third craving. It's served with the sides you expect.  This is the only restaurant that has a decent Chorizo.  I finally had to ask and it turns out they buy it at the big Mexican grocery in Brookline. The Choriqueso is a great appetizer you should try.  Chicken Fried Steak whole over a salad and topped with the most amazing lemon sauce.  Simple Fresh Wholesome.  Refreshing.  Tacos with pork and pineapple.  Salty but addictive.  Kids faves: (my kids are 8 and 10)  Cheese or Chicken Enchiladas with the red sauce Quesadillas (the kids really like the rice and typically eat both theirs and ours) Cheese Empanadas (on the appetizer menu and called something more alluring."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. The menu looked very good. However I must admit charging for chips and salsa is such a no-no. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa!!! This would be the first of many complaints for the meal. Bryan ordered a beer I ordered my standard water. For our app we ordered pazole to share and they were out on it so we went with the xochitl soup. It was ok. Nothing spectacular. Then we waited for food and drinks. I asked if they had horchata and they do!! It was ok. It had a weird aftertaste though.  I ordered the Chiles Tehuacan which was sweeter then I thought it was going to be but not to bad. The rice was a bit Under cooked as well.  Bryan got fajitas and he liked the fresh tortillas. The staff here just seamed like they had no idea what they were doing. It took forever for drinks and food and for empty plates to be taken away. It was just bad. For dessert we had fried ice cream which was actually the stand out for me. It was perfect. Also the prices were really high. When it was time to pay the check our waiter charged Bryans card to someone else's bill. We noticed it and he fixes it but service just seamed a mess. Alas I was let down. I won't be returning. The prices are to high the service was unorganized and the food was just average."}
{"text":"Per the suggestion of a friend, we stopped at Cinco for dinner on a recent Sunday. I was surprised to see that the restaurant was almost full with only two tables open and several large parties with children. Cinco is very kid friendly. We started our meal with guacamole and salsa. I was a bit taken aback by the fact that you have to pay for chips and salsa. I always feel nickeled and dimed when I have to pay for bread or chips. The guac was extremely bland. It tasted like it onl contained two ingredients, avocado and a ridiculous amount of lime. I had about three bites and left the rest on the table. I then ordered the ciudad due mexico-seasoned pork topped with pineapple, onions, cilantro and salsa with a side of rice and beans. I opted for no onions and somehow ended up without salsa as well. Good thing we had some on the table. I thoroughly enjoyed their tortillas- soft and flaky- but the actual taco was not what I was expecting. The pork and the pineapple were mixed together in the sesoning. The only way I can explain this is that they mixture was prepared earlier in the day or possibly earlier in the week and was warmed up and placed in my tortillas. I understand that slow roasting takes time and am fully on board with the meat being prepared ahead of time. However, I felt that adding the pineapple to the mixture masked the taste of the pineapple. As I was biting the tao, I was unsure if the chunks I was gnawing on were of pork or pineapple. They both tasted the same. This dish could have been much better had they added the pinpple on top of the meat prior to serving. All in all, I do not think that I will head back to Cinco."}
{"text":"I was charged $12 each for two dishes listed on the menu for $9 each.  I pointed this out to the waitress as we left.  She said she was sorry but did not offer to correct and refund the difference.  We certainly will not return and suggest anyone dining at Cinco review their bill closely.  Ripping folks off seems to be part of the business plan."}
{"text":"Whatva great find!  My sister and brother in law died and you're on Friday and were raving about the food so much the rest of my family including my sister and my brother in law had dinner here on Saturday night! It was excellent! Fish tacos are very good I cannot recommend them more! my brother-in-law wishes he had married the chicken enchiladas instead of my sister.  (Just kidding)"}
{"text":"Jimena was one of the best servers I've had in quite some time! Hope you get in her section!  We had great service and great food at a very reasonable price. I had a fajita skillet dish with steak, shrimp and chicken. My boyfriend had the enchiladas. Both were delicious!  Also, if you out order a large margarita, be prepared for a LARGE margarita! Not complaining, it was a delicious surprise!"}
{"text":"Update - There is a \"for lease\" sign on the building. It's safe to say they closed."}
{"text":"Food here was ok, not the best option. Personally I like El Paso and Emilianos better. When we walked in we were not very impressed, it looked more like a bar than a restaurant. They do charge for their chips and salsa which is typically complimentary at other places.  On a positive note our server was very nice and made the experience better."}
{"text":"Was looking for another Mexican restaurant. Cinco just opened & we thought we'd try it.  Service was friendly, but our waitress wasn't overly knowledgable of the menu. I had the enchiladas & they were OK. Spanish rice needed more seasoning. Missus had shrimp tacos & she enjoyed them a great deal.  All new places need to work out a few kinks. I'm sure they will take care of them."}
{"text":"Eh, I didn't like this place much either, especially when I had been craving Mexican. The sopes were ok, the salsa was pretty good as well, but the Tacos Coapa were flavorless. We didn't stay for dessert due to the crappy seating, the bad lighting, and the inept, slow service. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...but, after giving a couple of tries, I just can't say that I'm all that impressed.  First of all...they are never busy when we go.  Not sure why, but we always feel like we will get great service since we are usually the only people in there...not always the case.    A couple of times, I have gotten food to go...and would wait at the bar until my food came up.  TWICE now...I noticed that their glasses above the bar are FILTHY!  I mean...GROSS!  I mentioned something the first time...in a very nice way so as to not embarrass the bartender.  She seemed surprised, but took the constructive criticism  well...but unfortunately, when I stopped again recently....there they were again...those bacteria ridden glasses just hung there screaming...WASH ME PLEASE!!!!  So, I asked for a clean glass...and ordered a glass of red wine (it was subzero out...so no margarita for me)...and it was awful!  I get that it's a Mexican place, so margaritas are the standard...but, if you are going to have wine as an option, please don't serve rot-gut.  BLECH!  The food is mediocre at best...some days it was better than others...but the last couple of times it was sub-par...and the sides that they send you home with are really pittiful.  We ordered two dinners and we got maybe a half cups worth of rice...and a half cups worth of beans.   I also agree with the other comments that chips and salsa should just be complimentary.    I'm doubtful that we will go here again..."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I wanted to like this place. We've been counting down the days until it opened. So I'm deeply sad to report that I'm very much \"Meh\" on the place. In fact, I'm borderline \"Eeek\".   The service was just plain ol' bad. We were left waiting forever for most things. Water's asked for, never came, we sat and watched our margarita's at the bar ($7.50 each) a good 10 minutes before they made it too our table and my daughters order was completely wrong.  Oh and did I mention the Mexican holiday music and it's not even Halloween yet. Argh. The thing that really burns me about the lack of service is the manager (I'm making an educated guess that the man behind the bar, ringing checks but doing little else, was the manager, never helped any of the servers, who all looked in the weeds the entire time. No one asked how our meal was. We were never checked on. We were asked if we wanted another Margarita when we asked for our check. We probably would have had another 20 minutes ago. Had I left drunk, perhaps today's review would have been kinder!   As for the food, utterly forgettable. Chips, good. Salsa, so-so. (And don't expect them to come to your table for free, oh no, there's a $2.50 charge for that.) Guacamole ($4), bland (note to Cinco, there are other ingredients in guac other then avocados!) My husband had shrimp fajitas ($15.50) . Meh. I asked if they could make me a vegetarian burrito. I asked for cheese. Nope! I got onions and peppers with a couple of black beans and zero sides. It was beneath Chipotle for twice the price. It also always burns me when they charge me the same as the meat option when I didn't get anything instead. Add a little guacamole or cheese instead of the meat or charge me less. Anyhow... $12.00. My daughter went off menu and asked for a bean, rice and cheese burrito. Sounds easy? Wrong. She got a burrito loaded with onions and peppers just like mine. The second attempt? A tortilla with just black beans. What? Booo!   Although none of us enjoyed ourselves, we may wait a month or two and give Cinco one more try because they are new and so close. Maybe. Or Maybe not."}
{"text":"We had dinner as a family. Two people had chimichangas and really enjoyed them. One person had the pork tacos with pineapple and they chowed them down. I had a small bite and they were really good. I ate the chicken enchiladas. I had a choice of red, green or mole sauce. I chose mole. It was a bit sweet. I would try the green next time. The bummer was that they don't give you chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants do. Plus they were very skimpy on the guacamole that came with the chimichanga. Good food and good service. We will be back."}
{"text":"We went there once.  And never went back.  We live around the corner and love Mexican food....so it's a little odd that we just never go, and there's probably a reason...it might be that the restaurant setup is a little awkward (there's just a bar/pit in the middle and tables around)...it might be that the food was OK, not great....who knows?   But, on the plus, and the reasons we'll probably pop in again, the drinks were generous and they didn't skimp on the liquor (I'm looking at you & your skimpy cocktails, Max & Erma's!), the selection was better than your standard Amercanized Mexican fare, so it's worth another visit, but I'm still waiting to be impressed."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the restaurant.  Being from Mexico, we know authentic food.  This restaurant was at best 70% authentic. Wife and I ate there a few times and found the taste was never consistent. The wait staff is unprofessional in appearance.  You don't know who works there.  No uniforms or even shirts saying Cinco.  One worker was at least wearing a Mexican soccer jersey and that made us at least feel someone was trying to be authentic.  Unkempt appearances of the wait staff make you feel like you are in a cheap bar.  Our latest visit was on Sept 16th (Mexico's Independence Day).  The owners did nothing to promote this.  This was a huge disappointment for the someone of Hispanic decent. I guess the owners would rather \"sell out\" and be an \"Americanized Mexican\" restaurant than truly be authentic.  Other visits to the restaurant we experienced dirty glasses piled up on the bar near the ice maker.  I also noticed a bartender using her hands in addition to a glass to scoop ice from the ice machine.  Dirty!!!! No, I don't want ice in my drink.  I should have called the health department on that one.    Happy hour prices.  Watch out for this catch!  Happy hour drinks and appetizers are advertised on a sign at the door.  These are for only at the bar, not at a table. Not all of the appetizers are on special either.    Overall I have been disappointed. Food is just okay and  never consistent in taste.  Prices are a bit high for what you get.  But then again, they are located in an upper middle class neighborhood.  I hate to say it, but I don't expect them to last very long.  Poor service, less than good food, unprofessional staff and high prices will drive them out of business.  I hope the owner changes some things at this restaurant.  It would be good to see a place that serves truly authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Cinco is more like a Dos on the rating scale for me.   The idea that a Mexican restaurant had gotten a foothold in drowsy, whitebread Upper St. Clair held promise. Cinco's extensive menu included detailed descriptions of dishes I'd never before heard of. If only things hadn't degraded so much throughout the course of our dinner.   A trio of Sopes (a.k.a. gorditas) with ground beef (one can also go meatless or with chicken) opened the meal. The small, handmade disc-shaped tortillas were topped with refried beans, lettuce, queso fresco, diced tomatoes, and sour cream, and were a picture of attractive plating, but frankly their flavor was non-descript in spite of their components.   The tortilla chips were also housemade and agreeably recalled kettle-cooked potato chips. Unfortunately, the guacamole came off like a mossy, sub-par hummus, and the accompanying salsa was a soupy failure akin to doctored spaghetti sauce from a can.   Served in a cast-iron skillet, La Parilla was my chosen entree, and while its combination of grilled pork, chicken, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and chorizo was moderately appetizing, the rice was dreadfully drab. The flour tortillas were moist and sticky the way I prefer them, but more of that tragic guacamole was included along with mess hall-level beans. Essentially, I had fajitas, which I usually don't get excited about once the attention-getting sizzle fizzles.   Our server seemed like a genuinely nice young fellow, but his service was off-base the entire time. We waited too long for everything from beverages and appetizers to our main courses and tab.   What? Ya think we felt like hanging around for dessert at this point?   And speaking of checks, we saw a number of them laying around uncollected for up to 30 minutes at a time. While business was brisk, Cinco wasn't getting slammed either, and the restaurant appeared to be so amply staffed, some employees could be seen socializing, sitting around, or munching on food at the bar. Even the hostess had to dismount her stool and finish chewing and swallowing her snack before she could greet us.   Another reviewer mentioned \"awkward seating,\" and I shall concur. We were seated at a small table for two against a wall, and my left elbow kept hitting that wall each time I tried to raise a utensil. Making things even more artless for us as well as our server was the fact at our table barely held all of our dishes.   One more caveat concerns the dim lighting. No restaurant needs to be this gloomy, particularly a Mexican restaurant, especially when the exterior of the building (I suspect this used to be a bar) is so colorful.   Those transplanted malcontents who are thrilled to proclaim that Pittsburgh has no quality Mexican dining options will have themselves a wooly mammoth of a time ripping Cinco apart. I can read their snarky reviews ('Graffiti?' As Bourdain once put it?) already."}
{"text":"Reboot! Make way for a new menu.   Smaller menu and probably more to the tastes of what most in this area think of as Mexican food.  Stopped by a couple of weeks ago and they had stopped making most items and only had some tacos, burritos and a few other simple items on the menu.  Was told to stop back in a few weeks.   The new menu seems to be shorter and has some interesting items.   Notice they still have the Sopa Azteca, really good last time but decided not to order since not real hungry.  Ordered the Lomitos Majahual, a marinated port in a red sauce served with rice, beens and a salad.  Received 3 tortillas, so you can stuff a tortilla or eat it off the plate.    The food was hot and good.  The pork was 4 large chunks with a nice tasting red sauce.  One piece of the pork seemed to be overcooked, but the rest not. Not sure how that happens.    You can also get a beer or Margarita with your meal.  It was not busy but I still think later, when this place gets crowded, it will be hard to get the food out fast enough with so many tables."}
{"text":"Food is very bland and dry. Service was hot and cold--slow out front but super-quick from the kitchen. There was a serious language barrier with our party and our waiter (who was charming, adorable and maybe still learning his job). A couple of items we ordered may have even been wrong. So when our quesadilla app came out and looked just like empanadas, we just ate them. Sope cake tasted more like potato than corn. The entrees were forgettable. Mole was sour, my pork tacos dry, needed some salt, salsa, sauce."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican, casual, good service"}
