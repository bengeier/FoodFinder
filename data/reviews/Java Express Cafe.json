{"text":"Coffee here is the best in the city. They roast their own beans and have cold brew iced coffee. Not a chain, family owned and everything fresh made, hard to find this kind of coffee shop in the area. I always make it a point to stop when I'm home."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The owner, his wife and staff are very friendly.  They make the best lattes!"}
{"text":"Wish I stopped in here sooner! This little cafe in Mentor is awesome. Better than Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. The lattes are delicious and the bagel sandwiches are sooo yummy."}
{"text":"Great coffee and sandwiches! The owners are wonderful people, both take a moment to welcome you."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! First off, they roast their own beans, which is a rarity around this part of greater CLE. Also, the staff is friendly, remembers my name, and just feels very \"at home.\" The muffins!!! So delicious. And a great place to stop for a quick delicious bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. I stop in when I have extra time to wait in line on the way to work for a better cup than the gas station."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since it opened! The owner is incredibly kind and personable, the iced toddy is the best I've ever had and the atmosphere is comforting!"}
{"text":"First impressions last a lifetime!  I passed this place quite a few times being a mentor native, and lover of coffee, however my schedule usually kept me coming just past closing times. So today, was my fist and second time in there! Yeah! It was that good!  Staring at the board I wasn't sure where to start my journey with this company; so a basic coffee with sugar free vanilla is what I got, but I was pretty much assured that even if it wasn't on the menu it could be made which is a huge plus because I can sometimes be quite creative!   The atmosphere was just great, it was a nice relaxing place I wish I had more time to stay to check it out. Maybe that's why I brought my brother back for a second round, this time we tried Smoothies. I can't remember the exact name of the one I got but it was Amazing.  During this trip I believe the owner came out and was talking to us.  He seemed like such a great guy, very friendly and seemed genuinely interested in what we had planned for the rest of the day.   This place was added as a contact to my phone because you can even call in orders!! Like What?!?!?  Seriously this place is going to become  a routine stop :)"}
{"text":"Freshly roasted beans are what real coffee is all about!  Frustrated by yet another dried out bag o' beans from the grocery store, I typed in coffee beans as a search & saw Java Express.  Oh man!  After being warmly greeted by the gal behind the counter & seeing how crowded it was, I figured this was the real deal!  It is!  After inquiring about the lightest roast, the owner was called out to consult with me.  Clutching the pound of organic Guatemalan beans, I rushed home & brewed the best, freshest coffee I've ever made.  100% happiness!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried is excellent from the specialty coffee drinks to the bagels/sandwiches. I love that they have Torani syrups in various flavors which you can add to coffee and lattes to spice up your usual drink. The iced mocha with banana syrup has been a favorite of mine lately. The staff is super friendly and helpful, always greeting you with a cheerful smile and \"hello\" when you walk in.  They have several tables and some comfy chairs and the place is kept very clean. They also offer house roasted coffee beans in various flavors to take home and brew yourself. Support small business and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The absolute best coffee and breakfast sandwiches in Mentor!! So many different varieties of coffee but their iced coffee is the best I've ever had. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service! They treat strangers like friends and friends like family! Definitely prefer this place over big coffee chains as the service is better and the prices are much cheaper! Loooovveeeeee"}
{"text":"This has become our \"regular\" go-to on Saturday mornings. The people are so great, very friendly and welcoming. Their coffee is AMAZING, with new and unique flavors each time we come in, and you can't go wrong with their breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Love this local place! I have driven by it many times and one day my husband and I figured we would try it out. Best decision! Their breakfast sandwiches were amazing! I buy coffee beans now and the grind them right here for me. The Columbian is really good. They also have a rewards program."}
{"text":"Food is great. But the service was terrible. I was there and witness the owner go off on a gentlemen who was picking up an order for a company. He was arguing with the kid about using multiple cards for the orders very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Unbelievable paprikash, snitzel and all home cooked meals. Desserts to die for, strudels, tortes, tiramisu, pies. Small, intimate setting. Great food at reasonable prices. A hidden gem"}
