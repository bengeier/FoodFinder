{"text":"Cute cafe with a Starbucks outpost right off the main lobby at Chandler Regional Medical Center (CRMC) Starbucks has their own cashier, grab and go sammies, baked goods, fruits, and snacks and is open even when Cafe Kindness isn't.   You grab a tray and go through the line at Cafe, first stop is hot food: at breakfast this is anything from egg sammies to hot oatmeal, toast, bacon, sausage, etc. Every meal has a Special of the Day. Lunch has specials including two hot soups and a chili daily, most are quite good; they let you taste before you buy. They also have a different flatbread, hot meal, salad, and sandwich special daily, or you can make your own version of flatbread, salad, or sandwich. The final station is make your own sushi roll station where everything is rolled to order. The cashier gets your beverages: fountain drinks, bottled water, iced teas, etc are available.   Prices are inexpensive, lines can get long, but move fast, and food is good to very good, especially considering CRMC charges $5 for a companion tray if you are staying with your loved one. All but Starbucks closes between meals, and American Express is not accepted. The workers are all friendly and tend to remember you after a day or so, very popular spot with CRMC employees on break, too.  * See pic gallery for posted hours * ** all but Starbucks outpost closed on weekends (Starbucks is open until 1pm) ** *** When closed, the Cafeteria in lower level of Tower B is open ***  **** Complimentary cups of flavored water are served here, and at Lobby information desk ****"}
{"text":"I like the food but as it approaches closing time they always run out of things, even as soon as 1 hour before closing. So really the menu options are only available based on first come first serve basis...also I encountered various staff everyday for three weeks that were having a bad day everyday or must have hated working behind that counter. Avoid going to Lower Level cafeteria for a hot meal, they have worse attitudes down there, Cafe Kindness on the 1st Floor is usually a better experience.   FYI, Cafe Kindness has healthier options whereas the Lower Level Cafeteria has the less healthier foods like burgers, fries, fried chicken, pizza. There is a salad bar in both locations.  Overall, food is pretty good. The price is hard to beat but it comes at the cost of dealing with some very poor attitudes and the possibility that your sandwich only has cheese and mustard because they're all out of meat..."}
