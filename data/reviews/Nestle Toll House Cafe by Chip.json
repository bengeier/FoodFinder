{"text":"Gas station coffee made with an oversized nestle coffee machine, i can make better coffee at home  with my keurig, and the lady didnt know lattes could  be hot, she kept asking if we wanted ice in it:(  and overpriced"}
{"text":"Excellent cookies. I ordered a small white chocolate latte and it's very good. Lots of kids and a park with picnic benches and small tables with chairs. Wish there was a no-smoking enforcement though."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them one star. The coffee was overpriced, decided id try it Anywase. When the lady turned around I asked the gentleman who the manager is and he said my said why do you have a problem? I said, well she's kinda rude. So I walked to the sugar and she looked at me screamed and said get the fuck out of my store you called me a bitch! Woah sibling dramaaaaa never will I go there again"}
{"text":"Went there today. No cones available. Now their is an extra charge for topping on the ice cream. They now don't offer military discount like most stores at tanger outlet.  Man behind counter on phone the whole time we were there. Poor customer service.  This was my last time there."}
{"text":"I work here in the mall, and was so excited that I would be able to go to somewhere other than Subway on my lunch break.  Unfortunately,  the service here is HORRIBLE! Everyone behind the counter is more concerned about their personal lives rather than the customers that are in their store. Sorry Nestle, but you've been open long enough to have MUCH better customer service. I guess Subway will continue to get my $"}
{"text":"I tried to use a buy one get one menu item free coupon and they wouldn't accept it for any of their treats. They looked on the menu to me. False advertising!"}
{"text":"I come in here every once in a when I made a trip to tanger, usually pretty good service with awesome cookies, but today I went in an had very, very, good service by a really awesome employee named CeCe, she was so sweet and gave awesome service to my friend and I! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a mall employee and a longtime customer of Nestle toll house. I've been working at Tanger since before Nestle even opened. When Nestle opened I was excited to have other lunch options (pretzels get old fast haha). So I gave them a try, and really liked many things on the menu. The cookies were good, the wraps were great, the coffee was hit or miss but whatevs. The reason I've only given them 1 star is because of countless negative experiences I've had with the older lady there who speaks poor English. Everytime she makes my order its wrong or it tastes bad! And when I try and explain that it's not what I ordered she has argued with me saying \"no you ordered that\". Umm I think I know what I ordered. Not only does she mess up my orders, I've stood in line and watched her drop another customers wrap on the floor, pick it up and serve it to them! Where's the manager? Don't get me wrong, I've received great customer service from other employees like Justin and Cece. But that's not enough for me to step foot in that store again. Do yourself a favor and go to Fired Pie or Subway instead."}
{"text":"I love this place! I did not know this existed! As soon as I walked in, it smelled so good! I couldn't decide and ended up buying like 25 of them! THEY WERE DELICIOUS! My personal favorite was the white chocolate macadamia cookie. Ever since then I've been hooked! I honestly can't stop going! And their chocolate dipped waffle cones are to die for!"}
{"text":"Cheap ingredients?  Bad recipe?  These cookies were a huge dissapointment. Kind of reminds me of the chocolate chip cookies sold 40 at a time in a clear, plastic clamshell in the bakery of a grocery store."}
{"text":"There is no way I trade 5 years of salary controlled Simmons for anything short of an entire farm system"}
{"text":"I called in last Friday to put in an order for a cookie cake for my hubby's birthday. (It was on Saturday). I proceeded to put in my order and the girl told me to put the order in online. I went and did so and noticed all the pricing was different than what the actual store quoted me. I called back in to put in my order with them.The difference was almost $10. They said they only needed 2 hrs notice. However I still put it in the day before. I sent my brother to pick up the cake for me for the time we agreed upon and it was not ready. They said they did not notice the order. I needed the cake by a specific time and my brother had to wait almost another hour+ so they could put together the order. When the cake was finally done and decorated it looked like a 2 year old could do it twice as better.  The Happy Birthday message was barely legible. They agreed to refund our money. However, I was disgusted by the service. I will definitely not return and also make sure no ones special day is affected by the lack of service."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed. They barley opened and I was excited to try them out. Sorry but everything was dull tasting, I can go to the store, buy the pre-made cookie dough and make better cookies and brownies. Not impressed, save your money."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Nestle. I asked the associate, Paulina about cookie cakes and she was very knowledgable and formative. I will definitely be ordering in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get an ice cream cone. The help was quick & efficient. Quickly told me the specials. I only wanted the cone, but ended up getting the cup of 13 mini chocolate chip cookies! Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of nestle toll house cookies and imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon this shop from wandering around! I came here late at night and the cookies still tasted pretty fresh. I got one turtle cookie (I love turtles!), and the staff gave me three mini chocolate chip cookies for free. I'm not sure if free cookies come with every purchase, but that was a major highlight! They offer so many mouth watering options. Choosing just one cookie was nearly impossible, but I did it and now I regret not trying more. I highly recommend coming here for fresh cookies!"}
{"text":"I really love their s'mores cookies! Tastes so delicious! I also tried the peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia cookies, they were also good. The guy who helped me was very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Despite my previous 5-star review, as I write this I have been on hold (well, not really on hold, I can hear employees talking and working), but I'm \"supposed\" to be on hold for \"just a second\" to order another cookie cake for a birthday...for 11:56 now, and counting. Pretty sure she's not coming back to take my order. Should I call back? Keep \"holding\"? I really need a cookie cake today.  So hit-or-miss with the customer service. Sad.  Management: Please, Fire whoever is working at 12:03-12:27 pm on 4/10/17!  14:38...really don't think she's coming back. Can still hear female employees talking. 15:22...glad I'm so important, with my multiple cookie cake purchases here each year. 17:01...I'm done. There is just no excuse for this ridiculous level of BAD service.  Where is the guy who delivered my cookie cake to a high school parking lot when I couldn't get through because the police roadblocks around the stadium blocked my path to the store?  19:54...and she still never came back.  Haha!! When I try to call back, the line is \"busy\"! Wow. Just no words."}
{"text":"I would give this shop a 1 outta 10 because they are over priced,but not only that the cookies weren't fresh they were hard , 1 out of 4 cookies for $12 was good not fresh but not super hard and crispy very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a good place in Vega$ if you want to walk through a mall where none of the stores are unreachable for the average person. There are a couple decent places to drink and eat in here as well. My guess is if you're in a pinch (and at a conference or gathering) and you forgot something you need (a shirt, a belt, etc) this mall would be the place to goto because it's affordable. You wouldn't be upset with yourself spending a similar amount of money as you would at a store back home."}
{"text":"Great cookies and brownies.  You can't pass it up when you smell the food as you walk by in the Miracle Mile mall.  Good service too.  And there's a discount coupon in a publication in your hotel room.  Pricey, but what the heck."}
{"text":"Best s'mores cookies ever!.."}
{"text":"Nothing like fresh out of the oven cookies just don't forget the milk"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food and product , missing 1 star due to the customer service ... The GM is really nice but the rest of the crew needs some customer service intervention ! Thank goodness they crepes were good !"}
{"text":"OMG did you just sell me a day old cookie?!?!?!?!? DISAPPOINTED! We were walking by and smelled what we thought were going to be delicious cookies. As soon as we took a bite of the $1.95 chocolate chip cookie, we were immediately disgusted and were left with a sour taste in our mouth. WTH!?!?! The name got us. We use Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chips when we bake at home, and this was nothing compared to what I can make at home. UGH!"}
{"text":"I always find myself at the Miracle Mile because its the only shopping area on the Strip that has some reasonably priced stuff (as opposed to what you would find at the Venetian or Bellagio) with some good food and drinks. Whenever I pass by the Nestle store, I always smell the cookies. I found a dozen of the mini cookies as well as a regular sized cookie and it was super GOOD. Well priced too!   Sorry, Mrs. Fields.. The Nestle Toll House Cafe is way better. I just wish they had more locations like Mrs. Fields! Nonetheless, this place is one of my guilty pleasures on the Strip."}
{"text":"Was walking by the park of town square and felt like something sweet. Nestle cookies were the only thing in the area so why not?   Cookies these days are still pretty much the same everywhere so as for taste it didn't exceed any expectations, nor did it not. However the price $9 for 3 (technically 4 but it was buy 3 get 1 free) cookies seemed drastic and expensive! I haven't bought cookies like this in awhile (usually from the grocery) is that normal??? If so, holy moly how do they stay in business??? The cookies aren't made out of gold flour are they?  I will say the smore cookie was good but super sweet. It was a normal size but I only ate half, wasn't trying to go into sugar shock.  Anyways, they were satisfactory at the least. Don't think I'll go back tho, I can wait and stop by the grocery next time."}
{"text":"So I don't usually write reviews. But my experience today was so bad.... I ordered a mocha requested no whip and half sweet...and pay $5 for it!! So the coffee comes with double sugar!!! I request the girl to add more coffee or make me another one! She refuses..... Says can only add more MILK! Why!!?? And then won't give me the manager's name... Or number.. What is that!!! I have never come across such horrible customer service. Please no one should go there. Go to Starbucks and pay that amount..."}
{"text":"Hmm $3.75 for 6 mini cookies. My first cookie was so crunchy it tastes like cardboard with chocolate chips.  I was so let down. The others were better but very thin.  Next time I'll try the regular sized cookie.    I'm much happier baking my nestle from the tub you can buy at the grocery store. =)"}
{"text":"\"mMMmm, what's that smell? It smells delicious!\" *follows yummy scent of cookies* \"COOKIES!\" *opens wallet, hands cashier all of the money*  $3 a cookie. I don't know how to feel."}
{"text":"Way overpriced.   Two small chocolate chip cookies cost $5.58!! Yes, they were warm, but they were small and overly sweet.   Wouldn't buy again."}
{"text":"This review is for the crap coffee they serve. I ordered Hazelnut Caramel Cappuccino....sounds yummy right? But guess what?? Don't fall the delicious name they have given to this nasty no flavor burnt tasting cup of horrible mess.  It was so bad that I threw up! I think they add some cheap nasty syrup to some horrible motel coffee. Nasty Nasty Nasty!"}
{"text":"El peor expresso de mi vida. No puedo creer que el mismo fabricante de las nespresso venda un cada tan malo. El tamaño del doble expresso además de horrible fue muy pequeño"}
{"text":"I've never been to a nestle toll house before so my friend and I decide to try it. We came here around 10pm to get dessert. She got a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie, and I got sugar cookie and a chocolate chip cookie . It was so good and very chocolately. As for the sugar cookie, it was really tasty."}
{"text":"These cookies were a little less than I was expecting. We ordered 13 mini chocolate chip cookies, one white chocolate macadamia nut, and one triple chocolate chip. We did not receive 13 cookies. We received 10. The larger cookies were hard and did not seem fresh. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Supremely friendly staff the day I went. A hit or miss thing, I know, but it needs to be noted. The three guys on duty were stellar.  Of course the cookies are too. They're a bit pricey, but it's difficult to find cheap on the Strip unless its booze or buffets.  Don't expect conveniently cheap cookies and you'll find a new treat."}
{"text":"It's decent. Actually not really. Fresh? I wish. The pictures on this page make it look good, but my cookie was very stale. The outside rim tasted day-old and the \"frosting\" I thought was whipped cream or fresh icing in the case was hard and gross tasting. It left a nasty taste in my mouth. The place is very darkly lit and does not have the homey feeling you would expect. Also one cookie was 2 dollars and I can get a fresher tasting cookie for like 50 cents at a grocery store. Waste of time and money if you are looking for a fresh, gooey, melting cookie, and a comfy, homey atmosphere. Skip this place and go across the street to Fractured Prune, a make your own donut place, the food and service/atmosphere is so much friendlier and happy."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent the miracle shops 3-4 times per month and our boys love cookies. Both last visit and this visit were ridicolous! Customer service! The girl at the counter (named Brianna which is what she told me) was extremely sour faced and rude. No greeting no smile no thank! When we were ordering our cookies she just stood there with a blank stare and would say \"anyyhing else\" like we were bothering her. Once we paid she COULDN'T EVEN HAND US OUR COOKIES FEOM THE COUNTER!!!!! She immediately started fumbling around with something on her counter and I had to reach over to grab my order! I mentioned it to my husband if it was just me and he said no I noticed it too! So he told her \"you can at least hsnd them their cookies\" shebagain gave a blank stare and no reply. I mean if you work with the public you HAVE to have personality and ALWAYS smile and be positive no matter what ur your going thru or IF YOU HATE YOUR JOB! My advice get a new counter person. I work with the public as mgmt so I know how extremely important positive customer satisfaction is! Guess will be finding a new place to fulfil our sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Great experience all around.  Loved the lunch menu.  Cookies and Ice Coffee are always great as well.  The staff has always been polite and makes you glad you came in.  We had a cookie sheet done for our sons football team.  It came out great and the boys loved it."}
{"text":"This is an American chain that I've seen in Niagara Falls, NY and Boston, Mass. all the time.  I don't believe they are trying to compete with Tim Hortons, but rather Mrs. Fields as they have lots of sweets such as a huge amount of cookies, ice cream and cookie cake.  They are located in what I call \"the dessert desert of Bramalea\" as there is a Marble Slab Creamery and Funnel Cake place in same vicinity.    So how's this place?  Well, I had 2 cookies and coffee for 4.75.  If we assume the coffee is around 1.75, then that's $3.00 for two cookies.  I would say that's kind of expensive, but they are baked in house, so I guess that's the premium you pay for freshly baked goods.  The cookies themselves were pretty good, slightly better than Subway and on par with Mrs. Fields.    As for the coffee, it was okay. Comparable to McD's coffee.  However, I liked the couches and here and the design of the place. It felt modern even though it was in a mall.  Verdict: A nice little oasis and a good resting place when you are tired of shopping with decent desserts."}
{"text":"I like this tiny place! Its really small, and by the children's play area. You walk into this octagon shaped hut and there are cookies and ice cream! Woohoo!  The lady who works there is super nice, older woman with brown wavy hair. She made me a couple cookie sundaes and they were yummy! two scoops of ice cream, some chocolate, a topping of your choice and a little cookie. They were perfect for us on a hot day.   Its a little pricey but you can find something for everyone. Cookies, icee, smoothies, shakes, ice cream."}
{"text":"The smell grabbed me by the nose and sucked me back in. Then I heard these words...Buy 5 get 1 free.SOLD!!!  Its difficult to do a cookie wrong, but i must say they got the cookie making right 100% here. The peanut butter chocolate chip is by far my favorite. I could have eaten 6 of those things. The small location is perfectly located next to the kids play area. What's better then running around, having fun, then grubbing on delicious soft cookies. Im all about the sugar overload."}
{"text":"Staff has severe attitude problems. Staff said they would come out with the food we ordered (we both heard that clearly so there was no misunderstanding), then when we had waited for so long that something had to be wrong, we went back in and they said they never said they would take it out, and gave it to us in a plastic bag.  Please note that I have absolutely nothing against homosexuals so that is not the issue here. He had something against us but I cant for the life of me understand what it could have been. He ran the card twice and the first time it said no app. My only theory is that the first was a demand for tipping and because I did not tip he decided to screw up our order.  Who picks a fight with people who just want to be friendly and eat nice food?"}
{"text":"Quiet place to take a break  Nothing special here, just cookies and ice cream. If you already like these national brand cookies then you'll probably like Nestlé Toll House Cafe by Chip. I personally prefer something a bit more homemade.   However, Nestle has a nice selection of cookies and coffees. The  staff was are friendly, restaurant is clean, its a nice quiet place to stop and take a break."}
{"text":"OMG this is best Nestlé I've ever been to. The ones back at home (in Chicago) can't even compare. I walk past them all the time and don't pay then any mind. But for some reason I decided to stop here because there was no Mrs. Field's (not a good one) around. The Mrs. Field's out here are bogus, they have a limited selection, which excludes all my favs. Anyway, the Nestlé is reasonably priced considering its goodness and location. I'd recommend their traditional chocolate chip cookies, but you must try their pecan pie cookie cups, they are to die for! It combines my two favorite deserts, pecan pie and cookies, and once you put it in your mouth.... you're hooked!"}
{"text":"I work at the mall and was excited that we would have something other than pizza and subway to choose from but really, this isn't much of an add on. I gave them 2 stars because the customer service is consistently good when I'm there and there's plenty of comfortable seating but that's about it. The coffee is way overpriced ($3.70 with my employee discount) and its watered down, I make better coffee at home in my small coffee pot. Some days the cookies and cookie cake are really good and fresh, most days the cookie itself is hard and stale like they've been out for a few days. I've tried a smoothie and it tasted like water with a small hint of strawberry and not enough ice thrown in. If I have a really big sweet tooth I'll test my luck and hope they're having a good day, but for the most part I don't bother with them."}
{"text":"Delicious, crispy, Tollhouse cookies in a Mrs. Field's format.  There was a long line that was pretty slow moving, but it was worth it when we picked up our delicious chocolate chip cookies.  The best was the peanut butter cookie with chocolate chunks half melted on top.  Yum!  The sugar cookies were just ok... stick with the classic choc. chip and you won't be disappointed (unless you're looking for a big, fat, chewy cookie... this isn't the place for that).    BTW: There is no actual 'cafe' - it's just a small storefront/kiosk layout in the mall."}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG!   When they  close for renovations I thought it was closed for good.. But now their open again thanks goodness...  These are the best cookies I have ever tasted hands down.. The coffee is real good too..  6 cookies for $8 or 12 for $15..Not bad price but for gourmet freshly baked melt in your mouth cookies worth it once and awhile..  I hope they open more franchises...  Simply amazing...   :)"}
{"text":"Cookies and shopping is the best - this is in the perfect location for shopping while getting a little snack at the Nestle Toll House... Of course the deserts/snacks taste amazing because they are freshly baked and who doesn't like Nestle? 5 outa 5 100%"}
{"text":"We were there after the big Thanksgiving weekend and it was very slow, I am guessing the cookies were left there for days because they were hard as rocks! Really expensive, tasted horrible and they don't give refunds!"}
{"text":"Employee #85. He charged me $2 for two small plastic cups because i wanted to give some of the $8 smoothie i purchased to my 2yr old daughter. I asked him if all other locations charged for cups and he said HE DIDNT KNOW but he just charged me for it. $2 for empty small plastic cup. Thanks bitch."}
{"text":"Um, who doesn't love a fresh baked cookie while shopping?! Absolutely love the cookie and milk combos on their menu. You can't go wrong with any of the cookies!  They also turn their cookies into ice cream sandwiches if you ask!   PS: Ask what cookies were just made for the freshest kind!"}
{"text":"Great place to buy a birthday treat for a friend or relative.  I bought a huge birthday chocolate chip cookie for a friend of mine through Groupon.  The process was easy, I stopped by, got a couple cookies for myself while I ordered the big one.  I told the person taking the order what I wanted and the date and then a week later, stopped in and picked it up.  It was fantastic and very professional.  The cookie was perfect and my friend was pretty surprised, it took him over a week to eat the entire thing."}
{"text":"Ridiculously tiny scoop for $7.00? So, when I ask where the second scoop is...server says \"I put a lot inside the waffle cone!!\" Try and find a better place to satisfy your sweet tooth avoid this place."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, but the prices are ridiculous.  They didn't have the prices of the cookies next to each tray, and apparently some cost more than others.  Well, the scheme worked and I got scammed into getting 2 ice cream cones and 2 cookies for a total of almost $20.  I understand that the rent here must be high, but dang.. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"So I have been here a few times, the smell of the cookies make it impossible to pass up!! But I am leaving a 3 star for the cookie cake I ordered. If i were rating everything else including service and prices I would give them  4 stars. In was very disappointed in the cake. It taste nothing like the cookies which are phenomenal( if you have a sweet tooth). Once it gets cold and is no longer fresh and I mean as soon as its done being made, it no longer taste good. The prices are good for the cakes but I would definitely prefer the cookies! They have buy 5 cookies get 1 free and a whole cup of mini chocolate chip cookies for 5.99!"}
{"text":"Perfect poisonous little snacks. So many choices with chocolate in the center. Dont pass it up"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a sweet fix when my RW selection last night didn't have dessert.  I had just enough time before the Jacksons' show to have an ice cream sandwich.  When I asked the young thing behind the counter what flavors they had, she explained you pick any two cookies you want and any of their ice creams.  I chose a Snickerdoodle and a s'mores cookie and the ice cream I chose was cookie dough.  That's one from each of my 3 food groups.  She placed one cookie on a wooden thing, put a large scoop of ice cream on the cookie, pushed it down to even out the filling, and then she placed the other cookie on top.  She placed the ice cream sandwich in a cardboard ice cream cup and placed a spoon in the cup with the cookies and ice cream.  The dessert is a bit pricey and sitting on a cushioned bench in the Miracle Mile Shops is not a classy eating experience.  I knew that in advance so that's OK.  The ice cream and the cookies were good ."}
{"text":"I live in NYC and I Called asking how I would be able to order a cake for my cousin to pick up since it was someone's birthday. When I called who ever foreign man answered the phone said \"I don't know you tell me how to do it\". So fucken rude. I just hung up. How do you not know the different ways to take orders ? The he called back leaving a voice mail telling me to go online. Like Nigga what ? Dumb fucken prick."}
{"text":"Perfect. Soft. Chewy chocolate chip cookies. Need I say more? I need not. Find out yourself when you get your hands on this famously buttery goodness. Get a treat at Nestle Toll House, and choose between the classic and universally loved chocolate chip cookies another Nestle's flavor creations.  If you are at SouthPark Mall, pay Nestle Toll House Cafe By Chip a visit. Four Yelps."}
{"text":"Very tasty and yummy overall. The Nutella Crepes are a must try. Definitely will be going back again."}
{"text":"So the staff here is nice and tried to get the manager to honor the cost of what their own website states... They overcharged so I asked for a refund because the manager refused to refund the overcharge.. I was already spending almost $70 for a Big birthday cookie and a cookie platter... How literally stupid not to honor the cost of what the web site at this location states. I'm never going to give them my business again. It's a shame I am giving such a low score because the staff tonight we're great and I'm sure the food is just as good. But not honoring your prices and the manager's attitude is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"We were there tonight after some shopping.  We ordered 3 drinks; a white mocha, a white hot chocolate and a double espresso. These are not worth the $11.00 that we paid. First it took about 15 minutes to receive our drinks, then the drinks tasted watered down.  Disappointed!!! Will not return."}
{"text":"I used to work next door to this place and I loved their smoothies. The owner is always nice and friendly! It is a bit over priced but when you need a break this is a good place to stop by!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick snack on Friday, 2/22/18.  The cookies did not have a price on them like the rest of the desserts in the case.  When I asked the clerk, it was a bit confusing but the bottom line was, the cookies started at $1.99 each.    The cookies were not good, didn't taste fresh and grossly overpriced! we were totally disappointed for something called Nestle Toll House."}
{"text":"I got really excited when I find out that Nestle Toll house is going to open in this outlet. They sell different kind of stuff from pastries to smoothie, they also sell crepes and frozen yogurt. One of my favorite here is the coconut macaroon! It brings me back in my childhood. The service was ok, they need to improve and smile more, they've been only open for several days."}
{"text":"The cookie i bought was good but the service was horrible.  The staff has no personality whatsoever.  I had a few questions about how much the cookies were and the girls kept rolling her eyes at me when she answered. I would have asked the other girl working who was sitting on the counter, but she seemed to occupied since she was on her cell phone looking at facebook.  I will never come back to this location"}
{"text":"Well I finally gave in and tried one of the drinks. It was a tollhouse cookie drink. Yep I went there. Cookies in a cup. Brilliant. Sooo yummy. I enjoyed every slurp of it. Dont even wanna know how many calories were in that!"}
{"text":"They're open again! I was so sad when I saw the Nestle Tollhouse was closed before I got to try it, but they're open, with new management!  I got the six cookie and drink combo for $8.99 (came to $10.16 with tax). The cookies are orgasmic. There, I said it.  Holy cow they're good. And the girls behind the counter are so sweet. When I inquired about the cookie cake slice combo ($3.99 -comes with coffee, milk, or soft drink) the owner graciously offered to make one for me as there were none available. It would take forty minutes. I was tempted,  I had more shopping to do.  I declined because I was hungrier than that. I wanted six cookies Just like their logo says: big enough to share, but are you?  -No. They're too delicious.  Try the snickerdoodle and triple chocolate.  Drooool."}
{"text":"Buy 10 cookies, get 3 free! The chocolate chip cookies are delicious and fresh! We have approx. 1/2 dozen left, and they are still soft and flavorful. The employee was very friendly, offering the option of fresh lemonade and other beverages.   The Toll House kiosk is right by the Town Square Park. It opens at 10am."}
{"text":"Cookies are dry and overpriced. Staff was pleasant and it's in a prime location, but that's the only thing have positive. Don't waste your money on the cookies."}
{"text":"My go to place for a delightful coffee. Had a chocolate brownie and a cappucino. Just loved it. However, coffee was much smaller for the price as compared to other coffee houses."}
{"text":"Now. this was my 1st time buying a cookie from this place @ the miracle mile shops. I was on the fence about it b/c the whole reason I was @ the strip that day was to walk around and have fun window shopping w/ my bf and get some great steps in that day on my bodybugg. But... he was looking @ this place like a lost lil puppy. and..well er.. it smelled divine! We went over and decided to share a cookie, better than eating the whole one by myself!  we split the chocolate chip and walnut. so flipping good! WORTH EA. AND EVERY CALORIE! AND would have been even better if it was warmer. I guess I coudl have asked her if it was possible to warm it for a few seconds. maybe nxt time. if they do this for me, they will get 5 stars and a visit from ea. of the friends I have that come into town! :) if not, i will update to let you know.  NOTE: yes there is no seating here. it is simply a cookie shop.  I think they sold water too. Didnt even care if they have a place to sit. I was happy with the cookie. The mall has plenty of  seating in the middle all along its \"miracle mile\"."}
{"text":"LAME, lame, lame! I had expected a REAL cafe, but it was just one of those kiosk type stores (kinda like Mrs Field's Cookies in your typical mall) where you can purchase the items but there wasn't any place to sit. Why do you call it a cafe when there is no place to sit? Why not just call it Nestle Tollhouse?"}
{"text":"Freshest cookies ever. Loved it when Burger King had these fresh morsels.  The blonde marketing lady there was awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Normally when I think of Nestle Tollhouse Cookies that it means that you have to make them at home! How exciting it was to see that they have Tollhouse Cookie Cafe's out there! Steve and I shared a chocolate chip cookie! Just what the doctor ordered to work off my funk from having to drive on The Strip!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Nestle via Postmates today. My order was a 9\" cookie cake for my baby boy. I paid $20 for it. The cookie was completely raw on the inside. I called The store to tell them about the issue and was promptly hung up on by the employee. When I immediately called back no one answered and the voicemail was full! Totally ruined the moment - I'm sticking to GREAT AMERICAN COOKIE FACTORY! Never let me down after years of being a customer.   Also, the writing looked like a first grader did it. How is this a professional business???"}
{"text":"They totally didnt taste good or freshly baked. It had a yucky food kinda taste. Too expensive for unappetizing cookies, nearly $2.00 a piece.   There wasn't very many options. Straight forward common options: chocolate chip, walnut chocolate chip, pecan chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, triple chocolate, peanut butter chocolate chip, peanut butter, etc.  It was buttery, sweet n crispy.  Cookies should not be thin and crispy. Thin n chewy...yes.  But not crispy.    It didn't give u that freshly baked homemade cookies kinda taste. It tasted like they have a big tub of pre-made cookie dough that they scoop out and bake as they go along.  I wouldn't recommend it and I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum.   I have never been to a Nestle cookie spot before! Of course I have tasted the brand but not in its own store. I could not resist this place, the smell of cookies in the mall brings you here! I got a chocolate chip with mint chip ice cream sandwich. Sooo good!  The only thing is, IT IS PRICEY! For cookies I tend to become the cookie monster and everything is out the window! Take a look at some of the photos of cookies!   So if you around this mall, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm! Cookies! \"Enough Said\"!  If only Yelp could let you sum up a review with one sentence! I initially came to the Miracle Mile Mall just for Jamba Juice. It was when I smelt melted Chocolate and Brown Sugar that I saw the Nestle Cafe in bright writing. Somehow I blacked out all judgement and ended up buying two dozen cookies. I blacked out my diet conscience and ate about half a dozen right then and there. Boy were they good! I would definitely recommend coming here! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The store was clean as well. If only they had a store closer to me! For now, I will have to stop here every time I am in Las Vegas! I definitely recommend coming here!   P.S. Say Goodbye to your Diet!"}
{"text":"Great service and clean store. They have different types of cookies, brownies and ice cream flavors. I tried the mini chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich, chocolate shake (my fiancé shared), and a solo chocolate chip cookie. The cookies weren't as soft as I would have liked. They were probably a day or two old. The ice cream is the Breyer's brand which is average."}
{"text":"That's right, three stars for cookies.  It's one of those free standing kiosk type things in TS, yes it's enclosed BUT they don't have just cookie dough!  Baked, yes smells wonderful. However, I'm a cookie dough eater!  Choose your cookie and they even heat it up for you. Reheat, yes not hot and freshly baked out of the oven.  Perhaps at times, but timing is everything.  Pleasant, energetic staff- think sugar high people:) Nicely decorated cookies, a good variety and sadly I usually only have one. I need my cookie dough! Got cookie dough? That's not baked that is ha!"}
{"text":"My brother in law had to stop by the Oakley outlet, so while he was browsing there, I decided that I needed a cookie, and I need that cookie asap!    Walked in to the store and was greeted by the friendly owners.  At first, I was just going to go with a couple of cookies, but then was talked into the \"Buy 5, get 2 free\" deal.  My brother in law was going to eat a couple and I was going to take a few home to my wife, so it was a good offer.  Each cookie is just under $2.00 I believe.  I ordered my cookies and as the lady was ringing me up, she said $11.52.  I gave her a $20.00 and then she handed me back $11.52.  Not sure if the cookies were supposed to be $11.52?  Or $8.48?  Anyways.....took my change and my cookies and we were on our way.  I personally ate a regular chocolate chip cookie, a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, and a peanut butter cup (kind of a crushed cookie base, with a peanut butter center..almost like a mini peanut butter cheesecake kind of?) concoction.   The cookies were very good!  They were incredibly sweet, very soft but had a nice crisp to the outside texture and then soft in the middle.    If you have a sweet tooth, and are shopping at Westgate, this is your spot!  I would definitely come back to sample some other cookie varieties.  They were tasty!"}
{"text":"Was walking through with my family and saw this cute little desert/coffee hut, went to have dinner and skipped desert just so we could go back here to get desert. Looked and smelled good and that's where everything good ended... The coffee was 10x worse than the scuzziest truck stop and approximately 250% more expensive (which would be fine if it was real coffee and not hot water/flavor powder mix). My sister and I threw ours away and my wife had sent my son in to ask to switch the drink to something else and Miguel was rude to him... Thinking that my 12 year old didn't really know how to deal with the situation I went in to talk to Miguel. He was so unbelievably rude. I simply asked to trade the \"coffee\" for a bottle of water or something and all he could tell me was that he couldn't do it because of company policy. So I asked if he had a manager and he said \"it's only me right now\" then I asked if his manager was going to be there for the next few days and he informed me that he would be the only manager there...  As someone who is in the customer service business, I was truly disgusted. I know that Miguel has a boss and that he or she reads this..."}
{"text":"MAKE YOUR OWN ICE CREAM SANDWICHES!  Need I say more?  Located inside PH Miracle Mile and a quick and affordable stop for a treat.  Really nice if you have little ones in tow while in Vegas.  Staff were friendly and greeted us promptly.  Seating is available through the Miracle Mile but not specifically at this location - it's a to go sort of place."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, very respectful and well-mannered. I enjoyed a fresh cup of coffee and the special, you buy 5 cookies and pick another one for free, that's the best recommendation for a beginners diet when waking up in beautiful Sin City. I recommend the turtle cookies and s'mores, they were so soft and chewy...extra good with coffee."}
{"text":"I'm glad this cafe is here.  I came here on one occasion and had their chocolate strawberry crepe, which I thought was decent.  I would purchase it again.  The other day I bought 6 cookies (the deal was buy 5 get 1 free) and two scoops of ice cream to take home to my parents.  This cost about 12 or 13 bucks all together.  The chocolate chip was the freshest.  The other kinds are probably not as popular so sit out a little long.  My dad made a comment that the ice cream didn't taste like real vanilla.   However, I don't want to be too nit-picky because there really isn't anything in the area that offers the ease and convenience to pick up cookies and ice cream.  Sure there are tons of restaurants nearby, but like I said, ease and convenience.  On both visits I found the staff to be pleasant and willing to assist.  Also, the lay out of the cafe itself is inviting and cozy."}
{"text":"Double Trouble or a Little Bit of Trouble. the perfect combination of soft baked nestle toll house cookies with the most amazing frosting. No fake taste, real, smooth creamy frosting. Instant food high! Very kind employees too :-)"}
{"text":"It's a cookie place, people.  I don't think this is the kind of joint most patrons seek out.  It's more like you're in the mall, you see the neon sign, and you suddenly find yourself with a craving.  A melty morsel craving...mmm!  At least that's how it went for me during my recent visit to SouthPark.   You want a cookie?  No, seriously, you wanna cookie?  'Cause they've got 'em!  This location is also a shared space with Auntie Anne's Pretzels and Planet Smoothie.  So, if you have a hankerin' for one of those, they've got you covered on that end as well.  Located adjacent to the food court is where you'll find this fat kid heaven.  Anyway, cookies galore are available to those who so desire.  Are they as good as Grandma's?  No, but this is to be expected with mass produced junk-food.  Either way, you'll be able to get your cookie fix with an array of cookie variations to choose from.  They do cookie-cake's too!  Your cookies will be served by teens; likely working their first job.  Don't expect much in the way of customer service.  Just grab your goodie-bag and run!  So here's my only dilemma with this little cookie counter:  You can buy one large cookie, but you cannot buy one small cookie.  I simply wanted a tiny taste.  However, I was denied.  They have a six cookie minimum on the minis.  What kinda mess is that?  You mean to tell me that I can't give you money for one cookie?  I'm trying to give you my money!  You are a business!  Isn't your primary goal to take said money?  I only want one!  I can't even buy just three?  How many cookies do you throw away at the end of the night?  Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.  That said, get your cookie on Cookie Monster style if you go, because a normal serving size isn't allowed."}
{"text":"Their cookies in general are yummy. However, for this particular location the cookies seem to be a day old or more. They are not warm at all and the middle part even starts to crumble. The one inside the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood is the better option since they bake on site."}
{"text":"The cookies at this store look nothing like the cookies on the website. They were thin, flat and hard. The taste was whatever. I even bought it while I was hungry and anything taste better in that state of mind. I think you are better off just buying the dough from your local grocery and baking it at home."}
{"text":"I got a small Mocha Frappe which was $3.63 and it tasted just like water. Didnt taste coffee or chocolate. Cookies no good. The prices are ridiculous! Not again rather go to another coffee shop thats worth my money and time.  Meanwhile,  the guy who helped me was very kind."}
{"text":"Yummy!! This was the perfect snack while walking around miracle mile in planet Hollywood. The cookies were ridiculously fresh and still warm from the oven. You could smell the sweet aroma of delicious cookies lingering around every corner of this shopping mall. You can't help but stop."}
