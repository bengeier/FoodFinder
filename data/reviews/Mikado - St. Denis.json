{"text":"It was delicious. Sometimes, I find that for sushi restaurant, it's often hit or miss and in that case, it's a hit.   For 2, it cost us 70$ but I really felt everything was so fresh and the ingredients were high quality  I will definitively go back"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sushi I've ever had. We got take out and I was pleasantly surprised by the inside of the restaurant and thought it might be a cute place to eat in. I am new to the city and noticing that this place was a chain (3 locations) I figured it must not be too bad. Man, was I wrong! I couldn't choke down more than three pieces.   The rolls were large and stuffed with over-cooked (?) fish in them. They sounded good but were not as appetizing as described on the menu. Each roll came with a 'special sauce' that was just bad mayonnaise with either something spicy or something brown added. It also did not taste very fresh.  I will never eat there again. I don't know how they can call that sushi.  The only positive thing I can say about it was that the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"Repas correct. Service trop lent. J'ai attendu 45 minutes entre ma soupe et mon repas. Je comptais manger en 90 min et aller voir un film au cinéma Quartier Latin, juste à côté, mais ça m'a pris plus de 2h. J'ai manqué mon film. Je ne pense pas revenir de si tôt."}
{"text":"J ai pour habitude lorsque je veux un bon japonais venir ici. J ai fais quelques autres restaurants et celui ci est un des meilleurs . L accueil et le service est très professionnel. La nourriture y est tres bonnes , les sushis sont un peu gros mais vraiment succulent... Par contre deux points negatifs sont a noter. Ne mangeant pas de sauce traditionnel de soja je demande habituellement une sauce teriaki qu il me facture je trouve cela limite et pour aller en lien avec le point negatif le tarif est un peu salé mais la qualité a toujours eu un prix  Bon appétit au prochain :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went here on a visit to Montreal with some friends and everything about the evening was lovely. I'm usually somewhat wary of eating Japanese food because I'm celiac and I'm never sure if something will come with trace amounts of soy sauce in it (which usually contains wheat). On top of that my French is limited so I wasn't sure how I'd be able to communicate \"no gluten\" in an easy way. I started by asking the server about soy sauce being in certain salads and right away he asked \"No gluten?\" and told me he'd bring me a version of whatever I was looking for that was safe to eat. On top of that he brought me a separate bottle of soy sauce to use for the sushi. I was so impressed. The food was amazing and the next time I'm in Montreal, this will be one of the first places I return to. Thanks Mikado!"}
{"text":"The sashimi and Mikado rolls there are so good! The fish is fresh I can tell, and you can get the food pretty soon. Also I love the service and background music lol. Excellent experience overall :)"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and Mikado is my favorite sushi place. The sushi are fresh, tasty and the presentation is really nice. The prices are reasonable for sushi. The location is nice, in the heart of the quartier Latin. The decor is simple, but really nice. I like the ambiance. It's close to a subway station."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, in Montreal on vacation and the kids had a craving for Sushi. Found Mikado on Yelp and the reviews were all over the place. We walked to the location on St Denis and had a very pleasant meal. The restaurant was finished modern style and was very clean. Table presentation was simple yet sophisticated. Waiter was very prompt and polite we ordered a few Maki rolls and some tempura. Tempura came first with lemon slices and cherry tomatoes (nice touch) when the rolls came out they were all on one platter with ample ginger and wasabi on the side. Overall meal was quick and satisfying for a reasonable price. Again we went last minute and were very satisfied."}
{"text":"I am a big sushi fan, and this is my go to place in Montreal. I have been eating here over 20 years, and when I worked on st-denis I would order from there a few days a week, needless to say I know the place well.  The reason why I mention the frequency and the length of my fidelity is because I have never had a bad day there, it is always good and always fresh....How can a restaurant that is always full not be fresh?  I have a few special sushi dishes that are a must try, for one the Mikado surprise, a seared raw tuna crunchy exterior and spicy sauce, scallop heaven is great, lobster roll...and countless other fancy specialities all good in their own ways. The chefs there take pride in creating new rolls to please all tastes, always a pleasure to try one of their new creations.  I feel very at home at Mikado, it is cozy and comfortable,I cant see anybody not liking the atmosphere. service is always friendly, fast well this is a sushi place and you are suppose to chill haha.  All in all I highly recommend mikado....Maybe for a first time going in a big groupe would be great, so you can mix and trade and get to taste most of the menu, so much to try .  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals we've had in a long time. We have a neighborhood restaurant in Burlington that does simple tuna or salmon maki rolls, but I had missed the fancy and creative rolls that were part of everyday life in the SF Bay Area. We got an amazing fix of that tonight!  We ordered one special roll, the London Eye (tempura shrimp, asparagus, mango, avocado, with salmon on top and some special sauce underneath -- awesome) plus the 12-piece sushi roll platter of chef's choice. The latter included some spicy tuna maki; something crunchy with tuna, avo, and cucumber; and something with crab and avo. Everything was fresh, tasty, and interesting. We also had a large plus a small bottle of hot sake, and the Picasso for dessert, which turned out to be 7 mini scoops of different flavored sorbet in a little artist's palate.  Service was unfailingly gracious and friendly, and on the relaxed side instead of pushy or checking in every 5 seconds. The restaurant was very clean with a relaxed atmosphere and the sushi guys having friendly chats with customers who sat at the bar.  Next time we'll have to try some more of the special rolls. Thanks Yelp for steering us towards a superb dinner!"}
{"text":"*3.5 Stars*  This street that Mikado is located is hip, jiving, and what a great atmosphere! I loved how most restaurants made use of the sidewalk and put mini patios, but without making the space cramped.   My bf mentioned that this used to be a Vietnamese restaurant, but the same owners decided to turn it into Japanese (?). Even though we arrived pretty late, the place was still packed. After we sat down, there were more people coming in. Because we weren't that hungry, my bf and I decided to order a couple of things to share: Agedeshu Tofu, Cod, and several rolls. Over all, the food was good.  I loved the service. It was personable, and efficient, yet unhurried. A gentleman (part owner perhaps?) was patient in describing what their most popular dishes were.  This is my first Japanese restaurant I tried in Montreal (and I am sure there are a lottttt more), but I wouldn't mind coming back here. It's in a great part of town and the food and service is great."}
{"text":"Staff very professional  Food tasted good Layout It felt like the sea food they were using was in a display case at the dine in bar and it just thrown there badly wrapped was not stored properly \"hygienic \" and not clean plastic tupper /plastic /wear and it's the 99cent brand.all over the bar.  Decoration is out dated. The salad was good sushi good dish wear broken .  The street is full of homeless are Everywhere why Montreal is not doing anything about this. ????  Just help,  them the street night life is nice sad."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, huge pieces of sushi, gave us free appetizer when out of sake we ordered.  Great recommendation on replacement sake and sushi was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Funny enough, I found some of the best sushi in Montreal in the Latin Quarter. I also walked by the restaurant twice before realizing I was standing right in front of it. The inside is a peaceful ambiance with tables to the right and counter seating to the left.  A busy scene behind the sushi bar will keep you ordering new things by simply pointing, smiling and nodding.  Fresh sashimi, beautiful presentation, original rolls and familiar favorites. Fair portion and quality for prices that are a little above average and well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was OK. However the speed of both kitchen and service staff is extremely slow even though the restaurant seems quiet at the moment of our arrival. We had sirloin teriyaki which was good and quite tender. Mar di Gras roll was good and quite unique. If they are twice as fast this place would have been better."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had in Canada by far and possibly North America. I enjoyed everything I tried. The sashimi was thick and assortment of rolls beyond what you see a the average sushi restaurant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Favourite sushi restaurant ever.  Delicious fusion sushi with so much flavour. You can sit at the bar & watch chefs creating their master pieces. Wait staff & chefs all super friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Mikado () is a word used for the Emperor of Japan. This restaurant is located within the core of downtown Montreal. All things considered, the restaurant was good, but not outstanding. The service which was received was pretty good, they filled the water pretty quickly, the people were nice enough, if slightly distant. The food was good, I liked the sushi was ordered, and the tempura that we got was very decent as well. The food seemed fresh, the rolls seemed made well. The decoration seemed fine.   There were a lot of things about the restaurant that were good, but not great. I honestly can't say there was anything about the restaurant that would really make me want to go back there specifically, rather than try a different Japanese restaurant in town. At the same time, there is nothing about the restaurant that would make warn people off about the restaurant. It was definitely, A-OK."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I ordered through Just Eat and waited over 2 hours for my meal. Which is fine I guess, it happens. The real issue is they forgot my yellow tail tuna roll and when I complained they told me they will refund my roll but will reject every future order I place because \" I'm unhappy with them \".   Really? This is the treatment I get after waiting 2 hours for my delivery?"}
{"text":"This is a place I visit during each visit to Montreal. The sushi is solid, the service is spot on and the restaurants'interior and ambience is very charming, it is a pleasure to sit there. We all have been to some sushi restaurants that are quite cold and un-inviting, this place is the opposite. The only reason why I did not give 5 stars here, the shrimp tempura roll was a touch disappointing and thee edamame was saggy (how can you screw up  edamame?). After visiting other sushi places in the area, and spending more, I'd still go back to mikado to give them a chance. Overall a very positive experience. Beware of coming Friday and Saturday nights, this place gets very busy, plan ahead."}
{"text":"La bouffe est normale.....le service est lente....sauf que la soupe de fruit de mer est généreuse.,,.bonne portion!!si je vais retourner??po sûre....."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food. The best sushi I ate at Montreal. We got the private room with the low table (and place to put our feet under) it was really nice"}
{"text":"Mikado is about to celebrate 30 years! How many restaurant do you know that have last this long and is still great? They keep updating the place here so it does not feel dated at all. The setting is quite cozy and confortable. We came yesterday to have a late night meal have the graduation ceremony in which my older son got his master's degree. Many restaurant would not have accepted a group of six people here at 10 pm (we had a reservation though), but here, we didn't even felt pressed for time. They still allowed us to choose from the full menu and even advised us near the official closing time (11 pm) that we could order more from the sushi bar (we did) and that we could still take our time for the dessert. We stayed and chatted until past midnight without feeling pressure to leave from the staff. Talk about a dedicated crew!  Mikado has three locations in Montreal. It's still owned by the same vietnamese family and traces it's root to a vietnamese restaurant that was located on that side before (I ate there almost everyday when I was studying at Cegep du Vieux-Montréal around 1982).  Service is attentive, friendly and professional. The sushi are still among the best that I ever had in Montreal and they have a wide menu selection that include steak and other traditional japanese items if you are not into sushi. The sake list have grown and they now have a few private imports.  All in all, I think that Mikado is now as good or better as it ever was in it's 30 years history and you should try it is you haven't in a while!"}
{"text":"Good environment, friendly staff, sushi was excellent, salmon dish was wonderful. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Mmmmm good sushi! Those who know me, know I do not like seafood. So take these 4 stars seriously.   After being here only once I still feel able to leave a decent and fair review. I read a lot of the reviews before coming, so I was skeptical at how much I was going to enjoy (or not) the sushi here.   If I may set some of the other reviews complaints straight:   - The Decor: some stated fairly recently that it was dated. Not true. Especially for a place that's been running over 30 years! Very cozy and comfortable inside. There is a counter patrons may sit at and watch the chefs prepare the plates as they eat. There is also 2 private traditional rooms which may be reserved for groups where patrons sit cross legged with their shoes removed as per traditional Japanese meal. There are also regular 4-person tables along the middle; and, my personal favorite where we were sitting, up at the front with the comfy bench and table lounge type area with the big open windows.   - The Quality: some reviews stated the fish was not fresh...or some type of similar nonsense. This one particularly had me extremely worried because de base I don't like seafood and so for me to enjoy sushi it has to be absolutely fresh...thankfully it was all extremely fresh and delicious.   - The Service. Many reviews claimed service was slow. Again nope. Sorry folks, but you're wrong. To be completely honest, myself and my friend waited over 45 minutes for our bill, but that was because my friend is an old regular of theirs and so they know to leave him be and he will tell them when he's ready to leave. (I had not realized that was why our bill wasn't coming so I was getting a bit antsy by the end but now that I know I'll pay more attention next time). The other tables around us were served flawlessly and the place was packed. (I was being very critical of this element so I paid close attention, one service after another the 3 tables around us and our plates came out in perfect succession.) I did see a family of 2 adults with their small child getting annoyed at the wait for their bill: but that's on them, they still had uneaten food on their table, why on earth would u bring a small child to a sushi place?? Children are obviously going to get bored and restless before the end of the meal. Wait until they get a bit older or get a babysitter :-/ .   - Price: yah ok. That one hurt. But it was really worth it, the quality and authenticity were both there and the ambiance was perfect for a nice relaxed sushi dinner.   Now moving on to what we ordered:   - The sake: My first time so I have no idea if it was a good one or not, but it was nice and hot and I did enjoy it, maybe not as much as my friend, but enough to give it a few other tries.   - #1 Scallop Heaven: *****/5 and more! I cannot begin to explain how much I have been disgusted each and every time I've tried scallops, not this time, these were soooo tender and creamy in their breading topped with crunchy bird's nest and creamy sauce. This will definitely be a must-order when I come back.   - #2 Mikado Surprise: ****/5 Again, imagine my surprise at genuinely enjoying this unappetizing looking raw tuna. So fresh and melt-in-your-mouth! I would definitely be inclined to have this one again as well.   - #3 Tuna Jalapeño: **/5 While it was extremely fresh, I just didn't quite enjoy this one, not enough distraction from the fish, very lightly seared with a slice of crunchy jalapeño pepper, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a little more cooked (which I know is not the point) so I'll just avoid this one in the future. But sushi lovers go ahead and enjoy.   - #4 Kamikaze: ****/5 Tuna and salmon with tempura and some other loveliness, I really enjoyed this one, but I'm a sucker for crunchiness in my sushi. Would definitely order again.  - #5 Salmon: ***/5 the salmon was incredibly fresh but again just too raw for my liking. - #6 Coq: ***/5 This is a go-to fried chicken sushi for me, obviously, but here I found it somewhat lacking in flavor compared to other places I've had it. Wouldn't bother with this one here.  - #7 Le Mexicain: ***/5 Usually any sushi with crab, crab stick or similar is an instant fave with me, but while I did like this one I have 2 issues with it: one, it tasted more fishy than anything else we had had and two, I think the only thing mexican about this one was the avocado which didn't taste so mexi with the crab, cream cheese and mango.  #8 Avocado: *****/5 A sushi staple for me, perfectly enacted! Fresh creamy avocado, perfect rice... 'Nuf said.   And an extra *****/5 for literally covering almost every sushi with tons of beautiful red tasty masago !  Ultimately I feel the reviews that trash talk this place weren't giving it a fair shot. They are not perfect (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but they are no 3-star or under affair either. They do their business well and with pride and very minor issues aren't enough to take away from the excellent quality sushi."}
{"text":"Overall a beautiful experience for the eyes & pallet. The service is excellent & very discreet. The sushi pieces were enormous but I thought the rice missed a bit of flavor."}
{"text":"First night in Montreal with my husband; we wandered down Rue Saint-Denis searching for something light and easy after a long drive. Mikado looked clean and inviting with warm and attentive staff. We were pleasantly surprised by the lobster tempura (yum!), but as one commenter previously alluded to, when even your edamame is off (bland and soggy) you have to wonder. Our rolls...were not fresh. My dragon roll in particular was overpowered by mayonnaise and I could not detect an identifiable taste of eel. It's too bad; our waiter was quite lovely."}
{"text":"Mon mari et moi cherchions un bon resto japonais pour célébrer mon anniversaire cette année, en décembre.   Je sais que Montréal n'est pas le meilleur endroit au monde pour les sushis, mais Mikado m'a réconciliée avec ma ville et ces petites bouchées japonaises.  Premièrement, l'ambiance est calme et relaxante. L'endroit est petit, mais le comptoir pour les sushimen est très grand et on peut y manger.   J'ai commandé l'assiette de sushi et sashimi (nigiris, makis et sashimis). Le poisson était fondant à souhait et ne goûtait pas le surgelé, ce qui est essentiel pour obtenir un sushi de qualité, à mon avis. Les bouchées étaient bien préparées et nous nous sommes régalés. Avec un bon saké froid, c'était divin!   La faune était éclectique. À côté, une famille avec deux enfants, là-bas, des couples bon chic-bon genre, des amoureux et des copains qui veulent bavarder et bien manger. Donc, tout le monde peut y aller et se sentir confortable!   Kampai! (Chin-chin! À votre santé!)"}
{"text":"Sushi was ok at best and plates were not clean. A fly landed in my water...Wait staff was marginal at best, staff was hailed multiple times.   Not authentic Japanese food  Proceed with caution"}
{"text":"We were ignored for the first 15 minutes we sat at a table and then it took another 30 minutes and one comment to another waitperson to get a glass of wine.  They are only open until 10:30 and we arrived at 8:45.  Straight sushi, no twists, we finally were served at 9:45 and the sushi was average at best.  Definitely not worth the wait or the effort to visit again."}
{"text":"Staying within walking distance of this place and seeing all the good reviews on Yelp made me want to give Mikado a try. Realizing this is one of three locations that have lasted 30 years would make a it pretty safe bet for a quality sushi spot. Unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing.    The place has nice style, but it is showing its age a bit. You can see signs of wear and tear throughout the restaurant, but the lights are kept dim so it might not be immediately evident. I liked how the plates were on the table with two rocks sized water glasses in the middle forming a cool geometric pattern. A complementary plate of somewhat mushy edamame were brought out, along with warm washcloths as we looked over the menu. The service was very friendly, professional and polite.  To order sushi rolls you need to use a check off sheet. Most of the rolls had English translations, except the special rolls which were entirely in French or with ambiguous descriptions.  We ordered a large variety - for nigiri yellowtail, sockeye & Atlantic salmon, white tuna and Eel. I didn't like that you had to a minimum of 2 piece of nigiri. We also ordered a yellowtail with shallot roll, the mexican roll and the rainbow roll and off the special menu the \"mix and match\" which turned out to be tuna and salmon tataki served on a fried rice cracker.   The rolls were enormous, but bigger isn't always better. I did not care for the rice quality. The fish was bland and the eel was fatty with a weird flavor. The rainbow rolls were different from most places, larger and it seemed to have canned tuna with mayo inside. The Mexican roll was similar except spicier. I haven't had sushi this poor since I was on an all-inclusive vacation in mexico, but there it was somewhat expected, in Montreal though a complete surprise!"}
{"text":"Ordered some nigiri and specialty rolls from Mikado for delivery through Just-Eat. While I was pleasantly surprised by how good the tamago and sea urchin nigiri were, I found the Atlantic salmon nigiri left a lot to be desired. There was too much wasabi in it for my taste, and rather than being evenly distributed, there was an especially large heaping of wasabi in the middle, which kind of marred the nigiri for me. We also tried the C'est Si Bon roll and the sushi pizza, and I found both of these to be disappointingly bland. The chefincluded a complimentary roll, which was deep-fried and seemed to be made of shrimp, mushroom, and crabstick. Unfortunately due to the delivery service, by the time the order arrived, the tempura batter had become quite soggy - but that is no fault of the restaurant.   In the future, I would order the tamago and sea urchin nigiri again, and try some of their other nigiri offerings. However, I would not order their rolls again."}
{"text":"we had a bit of an aggravating experience here. we called 3 hours in advance to make a reservation. once we got there we were seated and sat there pretty much forever before anyone came over to take our drink order. a table was seated next to us about 10 minutes after we arrived who ordered basically the same amount of stuff that we did (sake, appetizers, sushi, etc.) by the time we ordered our food they were already getting their appetizers, and by the time we got our entrees they were paying their check and leaving. once we asked for our check it took at least 25 minutes to flag down our waitress to take our payment. all in all we were here for just over 2 hours which is just absurd. the only reason I am giving it a second star is because the guy refilling drinks was ON HIS GAME. you couldn't take more than 2 sips without him immediately topping you off. the second you finished a plate he had it off the table. I only wish the rest of the staff could have taken a page out of his book. in fact we pretty much had to use him as a middle man between us and our waitress the whole time otherwise wed probably still be sitting at that table waiting for the check."}
{"text":"I've been there a long time ago but I remember everybit. I've been there to accomodate my sisters who's picky and wanted different things. The only thing they had agreed was Japanese. I knew my friend worked there and choosed to encourage my friend restaurant. Really good experience and amazing experience of Japanese Cuisine. The menu is separated in two. One card is a self-service that you give to the Waiter when you've made your choices and the other menu à la carte is offering some decent selection of choice. They don't feel into those extremly long asian menu uber-complicated with huge amount of things we don't know. The result is that you only have the best on the Carte. I've had a home specialty: crusty tuna with some sauce. Amazing!  It had cost me a lot because i'm a well-built man that likes to eat and I had invited my sister so it came to 220$"}
{"text":"Fresh, cheap, awesome service... Was surprised when I saw such a low rating but went in anyways"}
{"text":"It hurts, physically hurts, to give Mikado just two stars, when on my last visit to Montreal I gave their sister restaurant, usually not nearly as good, many more, but tonight was atrocious.   We made the trip to Mikado from Cote St. Luc because we knew that every time we've gone, the food has been superb. Ok, small issues with customer service (when they tried to convince me \"usuzukuri\" was a type of fish and not the preparation of it), but the food made up for it.   We arrived around 6:30, and ordered about 10 minutes later. My father's entree arrived in about 15 minutes, a decent Chicken Katsu. My mother and my appetizers arrived a few minutes later. The first was Hamachi Sashimi that was so fishy-smelling and slimy, after one piece each we returned them to the waiter. He made no comment about it, not even the basic apology we usually expect when one returns inedible food.  The green salad was nice, the salmon tartare decent but nothing to write home about.   About 50 minutes later, we received one more dish, the salmon/tuna tempura, my ABSOLUTE favourite Mikado roll, and were told our Jazz roll was \"coming.\" This roll is lightly seared and then tempura fried - but when it got to us it was so cold it felt like it had just come out of the fridge, and the tempura was chewy. Again, we returned it unfinished, and this time he tried to convince us that the roll was fine and that we'd just misunderstood the way it was made.   Then we sat back to wait.   And wait.  At 8:25, almost two full hours after arriving, and more than an hour and a half after ordering, we canceled the Jazz roll and asked for the bill.   The only reason they got the second star in this review is because without us having to request it, they took the Sashimi, the Jazz Roll and the Salmon/Tuna tempura roll OFF the bill. We still paid $60+ tip for a meal that left most of us hungry, and heading home for a bagel to fill up, though."}
{"text":"one of my favourite place in town great atmosphere the bar is awesome a real sushi bar creative miss it will go back soon"}
{"text":"What a great place! We had a light meal before going to a show.- tuna tartare with avocado, tobiko and quail egg, Usuzukuri Shiromi (our favorite) and a Mardi Gras roll. The quality of the fish was top notch. the balance of flavors-perfect. The sushi chef that helped us decide what do order was very friendly, helpful and professional. He told hus how the restaurant has been in business for 31 years and how they have the best tuna flown fresh from Japan. We couldn't have been happier with our meal. Can't wait to come back and try some more options."}
