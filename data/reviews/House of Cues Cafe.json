{"text":"House of Cues has nice pool tables and is pretty clean.  However, every time I've gone there it's been almost completely empty.  What gives?  It's got a halfway decent location, is one of the few chill places downtown and has a decent sized American / Mexican menu.  Last time I was there was right after a home Indians game as well which left me even more perplexed.

Overall, I think it's a nice place but everytime I think about it I have to ask myself \"is it still open?\""}
{"text":"There are pool tables here (obvs). It is one of the few downtown bars that is not a pick-up joint. Sure, you will have that, but it is a nice place to go, play pool, and hang out with \"buddies.\"

I went here once for a 20/30 club event. It was right around the time I was super excited about craigslist missed connections. I decided to post a missed connection for s&g. I got a ton of responses, none of them from the hot guy I made eye contact with. One of the guys that responded I had actually met at the bar, was twice my age, and included a photo. So, if you are looking for that type of guy, then missed connections works."}
{"text":"I went here for some chili cook-off recently and it seemed pretty cool.
This was a Sunday so it wasn't too packed which is good.

There are pool tables and a lot of space for both sitting and standing. My mixed drink was damn crappy though. I don't know what was wrong but it sucked. Also they ran out of spoon for the chili which kinda seemed odd.

The music was decent but it seemed to be just 2 CD's kinda mixed together it was Clutch and The Raconteurs. I don't know if this is the regular thing or if it was just for this night or what.

Generally the place was cool. It was pretty clean and nice staff. It may be worth trying out."}
