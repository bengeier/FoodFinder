{"text":"Made a yelp account for the sole purpose of bashing this \"restaurant\".  The two dudes that run the place are rude.  Every time I call in an order they try to rush me off the phone like they have better shit to do.  You're running a damn restaurant, do you not want my money??  On top of garbage customer service, young buck with the glasses is creepy as hell.   While practically drooling, I heard the guy say to some female customer, \"Are you happy?  We don't want to get women's orders wrong...\"  Oh so if you have a dick in your pants then its okay to fuk up your order?!  This place has messed up my order 2 out of 3 times.  This ain't baseball folks, a .333 average does not fly in the restaurant game."}
{"text":"Huge salads that never disappoint. I was a fan of the main location in Mayfield while in high school and was very glad that I found this smaller location near my job. I'm always full, the pretzel bagels are amazing and my go-to is the longhorn BBQ salad."}
{"text":"I love their Pewter Mug Salad - it's awesome! Their soups are good and both their salads and soups come with a bagel. You'd be surprised to know you can also get a hamburger and fries here. Clean modern decor. Very pleasant atmosphere- Ethan behind the counter is a delightful flirt and makes everyone feel welcome. Consistently good all around. Try it, but check their hours first."}
{"text":"Run far away from this Cafe!!  Just run.  Food is greasy and typically the orders are prepared incorrectly.  Over priced, poor quality.  Ambiance is horrible.   Your clothes will smell of grease when you leave - your order will be wrong, and if it is right - it will be bad.  Their customer service skills are the worst I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Picked up some salads to go and they were fresh. The staff is incredible and the place is clean. I love the original and the cottage fries are Delish. The setting is cool and the people are nice. I wish jay was there more but I'll call his cell phone next time. Thanks for being there!"}
