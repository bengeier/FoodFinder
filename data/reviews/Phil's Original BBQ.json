{"text":"Phil's was featured on the Food Network's \"Restaurant Makeover\" a few years ago and I've been going to Phil's on a regular basis ever since.

Highlights:

-The smell of apple wood smoke is the first thing that hits you as you enter Phil's and it gets you salivating. 

- Pretty much everything is slow cooked in a smoker. And when I say slow, I mean over night slow!! So what you get is fall-off-the-bone tender and incredibly delicious. 

-I have tried pretty much everything on the menu. The ribs, the chicken, the pulled pork, the beef briskets, the beans, and corn bread. They are all tasty and portion sizes are very generous. My favourite item on the menu remains the BBQ Combo which is a dish that gets you chicken, ribs AND beef brisket!

Tips:

Expect to do a load of laundry after visiting Phil's because your clothes will smell like apple wood smoke.

Bottom line:

Service: A-
Food presentation: A-

Recommended? YES!"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of my friends with high hopes. I was looking forward to the pulled pork (looove pulled pork). 
We ordered a capchapas ($5.75), plate of the pulled pork ($15) & ribs  ($16.50) with all four sides (each plate comes with 2 sides): potato salad, coleslaw, fries and baked beans. 

All the sides were all fantastic. The potato salad was just slightly creamy had a bit of dill, which did it for me. I really like dill.  Coleslaw was more of the vinegar-y type as opposed to the creamy version. It was light so it balanced the meat (as much as it could). Fries were thick, perfectly fried -  crispy not greasy. We all loved them. The baked beans were cooked with meat ( I think it was pork...) so there are chunks of meat in it - delicious. 
I wasn't too keen on the capchapas - just not my thing though my friend  liked it. It's a savoury \"pancake\" with corn with melted mozzarella cheese in the middle. 

As for the meat...the ribs and pulled pork were both good but it doesn't make you drool for more.  The ribs were a bit dry so not as juicy as I anticipated. The BBQ sauce was its saving grace. It was somewhat the same for the pulled pork. It wasn't tender and juicy but also a bit on the dry side. I added a bit more of the table BBQ sauce (both the hot & regular, the hot BBQ sauce wasn't really hot at all) for a bit more flavour. 

Overall a \"meh\" experience. Maybe it's better on the weekends when there's more turnover? I came here on a weeknight and it was pretty empty."}
{"text":"The first BBQ place I've tried in Toronto and it was pretty good.  Its spacious and great for groups. We were a group of 5 and tried the following in decreasing order of 'yummyness'
-Ribs (small order): The favourite among the group.  Juicy and deliciously tender.
-Brisket - good on a plate and good as a sandwich as well.
- Baked  Beans- clearly slow cooked for hours for maximum flavour
- Potato Salad- lots of different flavours for a plain potato salad
- Pulled pork- didn't try it but friends said it was good.
- Coleslaw and fries- don't bother."}
{"text":"The food is just good - not great as it's made out to be on Restaurant Makeover. I've been at Phil's twice and always left hungry, while spending a good coin. That is a real deal breaker for BBQ joint. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I had heard of Phil's, and had to try it. I went on a Wednesday night at 7:30pm. The place was empty. I sat by the window, and the server came with a menu and took my drink order. When he came with my drink, I ordered the sampler - Ribs, Brisket and Chicken, and picked Beans and Coleslaw as my sides. The food came 30 mins later, looked ok, but looks are deceiving. First the beans, could have been canned libbys deep brown breans, not homemade, and not good. The Coleslaw, they have a mustard something vinegar slaw, very sour and did not taste fresh, and I did not like it. The Ribs, I got 2 Ribs, St. Louis Style Side ribs. They looked chared, and they were, but were edible. Most dissapointing was the sauce. Not good Phil, Sorry, but not good. The ribs were cooked fine, but the sauce did not help, and by themselves, not much flavour. No hint of dry rub or seasoning. Brisket - Tender, smokey flavour, but very fatty. They must have sliced the \"point\" instead of the leaner \"flat\". And the sauces that are are the table did not help. Lastly, the Chicken - a 1/4 white with the wing. Wow, it was very dry. So dry. It was inedible. I did mention the dry chicken to my server, and they comped my one glass of wine. That took some of the pain out of the $30 bill, (for one) but still, very dissapointed overall. 

Now, the kicker is, I saw Phil come in around 7:45 and he walked by me. There were only 3 tables out of 20 in. When I mentioned to my server that the chicken was really dry, another server (lady) came over and appoligized, and did not charge me for the one 4oz glass of wine. I said she did not have to do that, but thanks. Phil, just sat in his chair by the counter, and never came over to talk to me. That is the most dissapointing part of it. He did not care. Nuff Said."}
{"text":"i have wanted to try Phil's ever since I saw the Restaurant Makeover espisode on the Food Network and maaaaaannnnnn did it NOTdisappoint.  To start, the server we had was amazing...welcoming, funny, and accomodating.  
i had the 1/4 chicken BBQ with the coleslaw and fries.  Basic dish but layered flavour....It was so delicious. I'm going to have to wipe down my laptop from all the drool after writing this review.
This place leaves you wanting to come back.  Next time I'm downtown I'm there.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the for the apple crumble.  For whatever reason the crumble had the flavour like it got tossed in the same bowl that they toss the chicken in...mild bbq flavour.  Thought it was odd but still finished the dessert anyway. That is how my belly takes over from my brain...happens sometimes.  Maybe Phil did it on purpose...dunno....anyone else experince the same?

I will return!"}
{"text":"I first heard about this place while watching an episode of \"Restaurant Makeover\"  and since I recently saw them featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" I decided to check this place out.

I ordered the small ribs at $16.50 and thought the portion was pretty small for what I had to pay. The first few ribs I ate were fall off the bone tender, but I got a few pieces that were so dry and tough that they were inedible. My boyfriend's brisket sandwich on the other hand was juicy and delicious from start to finish and a bit more reasonably priced than the ribs.

During my second visit I ordered the quarter bbq chicken and was much more satisfied with the quantity, but not so much in the flavour department. The service this time around wasn't the greatest either. One of my all time pet peeves is when a table who was seated after mine gets their orders taken first. It should never happen unless a table immediately orders their food when asked for their drinks orders.

Overall I'm not impressed. I'll be venturing somewhere else to get my bbq fix."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Oh yes by telling you to hurry up and EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I love Phils. The BBQ is wonderful (especially the brisket), and the sides are to die for (best potato salad ever).

Friendly service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Pulled pork: a-ok.  Ribs: fattier than they should have been.  Service: mediocre.  Coffee: cold (although what was I expecting? It's a rib joint after all.) Chance of returning: slim."}
{"text":"I'm writing in the midst of a pork-coma (definition: state of bliss entered through the overindulgence in pork fat).  
Loved the food. Delicious and massive servings with lots of extra sauce right at hand in case you need more.  Baked beans were phenomenal and full of extra pork fat goodness.  The cole-slaw was fabulous (and mayo free).  
Only reason not 5 stars is the decor, wish they had left restaurant makeover to die it's slow death rather than invited it into the place (what the F is with the random trees on the wall).
Please excuse the lack of full sentences, I'm too euphoric to editorialize."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has gone downhill.  I've been going to Phil's for years, but not for the last 2.   With quality BBQ restos like Stockyards, Barque and even mediocre blah franchises like St Louis popping up everywhere you'd think Phil's would stay, at the very least, abreast of the general expectation of good bbq.  Sadly, this place disappoints.  Not terrible, mind you, but nowhere close to it's previous quality.

For $26 a platter will get you chicken leg/thigh quarter, 3 slices of brisket cut way too thin, and three small, thin, not extremely tender ribs.  You also get 2 sides - I got the once amazing coleslaw (still scratch made but now quite mediocre) and potato salad (bland and boring).  Both salads were straight out of the fridge (including the serving dish)  - a KFC fast food joint has more love than these salads.

The platter portions were small for what you pay and between two of us, we had to get more.  So we ordered the pulled pork sandwich & fries - it was better than the platter.  Had it not been for the decent sammy this review would be a 1-star.

Other disappointments from it's previous glory:

- not nearly as smokey and full -flavoured as before
- smaller, thinner ribs and not as tender (I think they must have changed suppliers)
- I had a big, dry, inedible piece of beef-jerky-like morsel in the brisket
- coleslaw used to be kick-ass but now is now is quite forgettable
- same slowish, non-personal service (which I think is the serving staff instead of the kitchen
- even the serve your own BBQ sauces seemed to suffer the same degradation of quality
- you don't leave that joint reeking like you've been in a smoker for 12 hours.. 



Phils - too bad.. I really want to love this restaurant again but it's slipped too much to be on my list.  I *may* go there again if I'm desperate, in the neighbourhood, starving, and not expecting much.  Definitely not worth going to as a destination visit."}
{"text":"Like it. Beans are awesome and the ribs are really great as well."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday as he was craving BBQ. He loves ribs. We arrived early and were disappointed by the limited beer selection on tap. I ordered a cocktail instead and was shocked by how small it was.  As for the food, we both had ribs and tried the fries, potato salad and slaw. All the sides underwhelmed. The ribs had a good flavour but were dry and fatty at the same time. Everything was a bit one note and unremarkable. We went next door for some pints afterwards and regretted going to Phil's    
We spent 80 dollars on dinner and left disappointed."}
{"text":"The much hyped Phil's was easily been the worst BBQ experience I have ever had. Ribs: Overdone, fatty, and disgusting. Brisket: I didn't realize that beef was supposed to be rubbery. Chicken: So dry it sucked out every bit of moisture in my mouth.  Our server:  got most of the orders wrong and knew hew was getting his 15%,(we were a table of 7) so he coasted the entire time.

The sad thing is, this place was packed. Anybody who says that this place is anything beyond mediocre, is delusional, and has probably never had a proper rack of ribs in their life.

If there was some way I could give this place a negative star, I would.


Phil, you should be ashamed of yourself."}
{"text":"Real American BBQ!

Too many places here in the GTA don't really get good bbq.  They use sauce that is way too sweet and most places overcook their ribs.  By overcook I mean they fall off the bone.  Ribs are NOT supposed to do that.  The bite should come cleanly off the bone but the bone should not fall out easily.  Anyone one can make fall of the bone ribs, just cook all the flavour and texture out of them.

Phil's is not like that.  Phil gets what bbq is supposed to be.

A couple of friends wanted to do dinner there.  Great I'm always up for some bbq.  A quick check on Phil's site got me excited.  He's a member of the Kansas City Barbeque Society.  While this didn't guarantee us a great meal, my expectations of this place definitely shot up as at least he knows how good bbq should be.  While not a member of the KCBS myself I have judged the open competition at the 2011 American Royal.  I learned alot from the certified judges at my table and honestly I can't look at bbq the same was as I did before that event.  The KCBS takes bbq very seriously.

Let me get the negative out of the way.  I'm not a fan of the way they make their hushpuppies.  I found them a bit dry and overdone as if they were in the fryer a bit too long.

Now on to the meat.  I had the BBQ combo and my wife had the pulled pork.

The pulled pork was superb.  The shred on the meat couldn't have been better with no chunks of fat or connective tissue that you'd find in a lower quality restaraunt.  

On my combo the I had a leg and theigh portion of chicken.  Again great texture, the rub was fantastic, a perfect level of smoke flavour without overpowering the chicken.  It was sauced just right, and for those who like it saucy, extra bottles of sauce are on the tables, as it should be in a good bbq place.  One should never have to ask for more sauce at a good bbq establishment.

The brisket like the chicken and pulled pork was fantastic.  I was just a little too tender for me.  I like a bit more chew to my brisket.  But I'd rather have it this way than to get a piece of beef jerky.

Now for the star of the show at Phil's for me, the ribs.  Big meaty side ribs :).  They were cooked to perfection!  Perfect texture, meat that comes cleanly off the bone, great rub, perfect balance of porky goodness to smoke to tangy sauce.  These were so good I wish I had ordered a whole rack.

If you like real bbq give Phil's a try."}
{"text":"Great ribs, average chicken, horrible brisket.  That would be a quick and fast assessment of their food.  I guess maybe it is because I have tried real American BBQ, but this does not compare at all, despite Phil's statement of training down in the south.

Fries are completely average, but the beans were actually quite good.  A little too much pieces of pork fat in there for my liking, but it did taste yummy.

Went in with high hopes, but came out a little deflated."}
{"text":"If you've had real American bbq, you will be disappointed with Phil's. I've been to Phil's several times because it's nearby, and I secretly hope it will be better each time. There aren't many places in TO that do bbq right, but that should be a reason to try harder. 

The ribs are the best thing on the menu here, mostly because the chicken and brisket are overdone and dry. The smoke flavour is there, but it's subtle and doesn't make up for the texture (this applies to everything here). All the sides are all standard issue.

The quality could be excused somewhat if the value for money wasn't so poor. For a light lunch you can get away with a small sandwich and fries for about $8. But if you're a hearty eater and come for dinner, you'll have to spend some money to get your fill here. If ribs aren't your thing, don't bother with the plates of brisket or pulled pork: get two sandwiches instead, it's the same price but you'll have more food. 

I see many highly positive reviews, and I can only guess that most of the people who come here haven't experienced much bbq. The service is warm and friendly, but given the quality and prices, there are better alternatives."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and it lacked any type of smokey kick.
I was dissapointed, based on the hype.
The sauces were ok, not at all memorable.
The ribs were decent.
The beans were good.
Not good value for your $$.

Not sure I'll be back, but I may give the pulled pork sandwich a try."}
{"text":"My beef brisket is acceptable....but for some reason after finishing your order over the phone the lady goes \"will you want a plastic bag?\". I always say 'no', because I don't want to be nickel and dimed for a fucking bag. Give me a bag for free! Phony bologna bag tax. You could order $200 worth of food and she'd still ask you if you wanted to buy a bag. Oh, and if you say NO to the bag...you have to carry loose cutlery, two containers of sauce, napkins, and your box of food. Give me a free bag, Phil you cheap bastard."}
{"text":"Excellent petit restaurant du coin de Collège et Ossington. Si vous aimez le style BBQ à l'américaine, alors c'est ici qu'il faut aller si vous êtes dans les parages de Little Italy ou de Little Portugal. 

Le restaurant, monté et géré par monsieur Phil, s'est spécialisé dans la cuisson particulière de certaines viandes. Vous y dégusterez en toute simplicité un 'pulled pork' ou un 'beef brisket', en sandwich ou en plat. La qualité y est constante et le service excellent. Si par hasard Javier est de service, vous serez traités comme des rois."}
{"text":"Four of us were originally planning to try Hadley's, but it's apparently closed, so we walked down the road a little bit to Phil's.
A little more expensive than what we had originally planned, but we were hungry and it looked fairly busy so we went in.

I ordered the pulled pork with fries and coleslaw. The service was 2.5 stars - quite slow and not very friendly. But there was only one poor waiter for  a moderately busy evening (not packed but steady).
When the food arrived it looked great. The fries were an A, thick and nicely seasoned, but the coleslaw was freezingly cold and had a lot of vinegar that it was almost drowning in. The sauces on the pork were great but the meat itself was meh. Dry and overcooked and I kind of expected more from a place that boasted about barbeque quality. 
I've had much better pulled pork made by friends and have also tried it at pulled pork fests where it's soft and fresh tasting.

Anyway, I don't know if I'd go back for the price, but it was.. okay."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ. 

The place though seems to have a bit of an identity problem. The music, decor, and a desert or two just didn't fit with BBQ...

I was expecting some pecan pie and big glasses of iced tea. 

The Pulled pork sandwich that I had was a little dry and greasier than it really should be.  They also seemed to skimp on the meat!!

The BBQ containers on the table weren't the cleanest either. 
 
The wait staff was excellent.
 
I gotta say though, the smell was amazing. The subtle smokey air made my mouth water as soon as I walked in. 

I'll give it another try, but I don't think that it's a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Phil: why are you so hit or miss??

I love pulled pork sandwiches. L.O.V.E.
I've been to Phil's a few times as it's a stone's throw from my work. However, each time I've been for the pulled pork sandwich it's always different! Grr. I'm not a fan of inconsistency. On my most recent visit the sandwich was perrrrfect. loaded with that delicious pulled pork, just the right amount of sauce all on an UNsoggy bun, even though I took it to go.
My previous visit yielded a completely opposite result: soggy bun, little to no sauce resulting in dry pork. Dislike.

Phil's is like that bad boyfriend you keep going back to. I'm sure I'll go back even though it could be a detriment to my taste buds. Please work on consistency, Phil.

Honourable Mentions:
- really yummy bbq sauce
- delicious redskin potato salad
- in-house smoked meat"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I live nearby, and I *wanted* to love this place ... but try as I may, I couldn't convince myself that this place is anything more than mediocre.

I had:
- BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich - the highlight, it would have garnered a 3.5 on its own. The meat was decent, but considering the way the place is presented, I did expect much more. It was tender-ish, and not smoky
- Hush puppies - I'd never had these. I was excited. Instead I got some really stale-tasting cornbread that were as hard as bird droppings. Sigh.
- Cachapas - this sounded exactly like something I'd love. Yet the taste just did not come together.
- BBQ Beans - dammit I love me some meaty beats. And yet again, disappointed. The beans were not very meaty tasting - hell, they tasted about as bland as my first attempts at cooking. Hell I didn't even finish these, and I'm a bonafide fatty.

So yeah. I really wanted to like this place. And I likely will visit again to try the ribs. But my first experience was pretty subpar."}
{"text":"Well I heard about this one from a friend so off we went to try it out.

Well about 6 visits later and I will continue to go. This is TRUE Southern Bar BQ from someone who has traveled extensively in the southern US.

The Ribs are the best, The Pulled pork is amazing, The chicken is soooo tasty.

Most meals come with one or two sides, I was most impressed with the baked beans and fries. The Coleslaw was not bad as was the potato salad , just did not knock my socks of like the beans and the fries.

Be wary of the large order of Ribs, IT IS A FULL POUND. Most will be better off with the smaller order or take some home for lunch. (THEY ARE TASTY LATER)"}
{"text":"Cool place. No fuss and has a small menu - go there, order your good and that's it. No much point in spending a lot of time hanging around - it's a simple place. I really appreciated the decoration (jazz themed) and the music - all jazz. Pretty awesome and gets you in the mood to appreciate the good food. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I had read about Phil's, and then saw them on that show \"restaurant makeover\".  I was really looking forward to some great bbq.  I brought my husband and three kids, and therefore had enough mouths to try just about everything. (If you're looking for anything non-meat, save your time.  The fish additions from the show didn't make it onto the menu)  The ribs were good,  not so good that I'd drive across town for them.  Same for the pulled pork...good...not great.  The chicken was dry and over-smoked.  The brisket was moist and flavourful, and the standout of the meats.  The sides were fantastic.  Perfect baked beans, crispy cut fries, tasty cole slaw.  We didn't buy juice for the kids, because at more then 3 bucks a pop, I could have got litres of it at the grocery.  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Friendly service and fantastic food!  I stepped off College Street and felt like I was in a little NYC BBQ Shack!  The service was fantastic.  We sat down and immediately were served by a friendly waitress.

The food arrived and we were blown away!  Fall off the bone delicious ribs.  The brisket was incredible too!  The chicken was okay, but I came for the dark meat anyway.

I'll definitely be back to this little BBQ joint at College & Ossington!"}
{"text":"FAIL!!!!

My friend and I went last night only to find a closed restaurant and notice on the door that they are behind on their rent.  

Why wasn't the website updated?  

So yeah, looks like Phil's is no more."}
{"text":"Phil's was done over by restaurant makeover.  The chef was so blown away by the bbq he didn't dare try to change it.

I couldn't agree more!  The portions are generous, the BBQ amazing.  The dining room is a bit ordinary, but this is BBQ folks, not Haute Cuisine!  

Their 'slaw is pretty amazing too.

Not vegetarian friendly (at all, unless they're happy with slaw and fries)."}
{"text":"Phil's had been highly recommended plenty of times by my southern BBQ loving friends, so I figured it's about time I checked it out. 
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was DELISH, and they have great BBQ hot sauce, that you can purchase to take home. 

As an appetizer we got Cachapas, and let me tell you, it was incredible. Its basiclly a corn pancake with melted cheese, and for an extra $3 you can add a meat of your choice. We skipped on the meat, and it was one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life.

Extremely friendly service, laid back atmosphere, and overall great experience. 

Apparently this place gets crazy busy and is known to have a line up, but when we were there on a Saturday at around 8:00pm, we got a table right away."}
{"text":"Phil, I still like ya, but lets start putting a bit more focus into the quality control side of things okay?

I usually get take-out when in the need of a quick pulled pork sandwich fix. For under $10 after tax, its a good deal and I wish I could give it 4 stars but the consistency has not been there to do so.
 
On the side you get to choose from fries, coleslaw, or potato salad. The fries are pretty consistent. I'm not normally a fan of thicker cut fries but they manage to make them well and with just the right amount of crispness. I tried the potato salad a couple times but the quality changed and last time ended up throwing most of it away, almost seemed like the mayo was going off or something.

As for the sandwich itself... The meat has never been an issue and I do like how they give you the 2 different sauces in the little containers so you can decide what flavour to spice your pork with. But today, I swear the buns must have been sitting out for days or something. I mean the thing was rock hard around the edges and most of the top even to the touch so the people in the kitchen should've been able to tell that when they sliced it. The thing was the driest, crustiest, stalest bun I've potentially ever been served a sandwich on. Luckily I had hamburger buns at home and was able to make the switch but really, that shouldn't ever have to be my responsibility when I'm ordering food from a business.

If I was basing the meal on todays experience alone, it would've been a 2 star review but I've eaten enough of these sandwiches to know that when done right, they are one of the best things west of Ossington on College Street.
Let's just try to get back on the ball more consistently, okay Phil?"}
{"text":"Was good while it lasted for the most part.  Sadly this place has closed.  Saw the R.I.P. on Toronto Life.  I have 2 bottles of their hot BBQ sauce still and I'll have to ration it out."}
{"text":"Totally about the savory sauces and smoke house flavor of the best BBQ in town. Willing to go again and again. Bring on the ribs!!"}
{"text":"I'm almost ashamed to admit I didn't know about Phil's until I saw it on Restaurant Makeover. Once watching the episode, I thought I had to check it out. 

The only regret I have is that I didn't know about Phil's a lot sooner. I live about a half-hour away, but sometimes I'll make the drive just for lunch. 

I've never been able to have anything other than the Pulled-Pork Sandwich (w/ beans on the side), since I couldn't bare visiting and not having that excellent dish. There's absolutely nothing like it. I miss it right now.

The service is speedy. The prices, at least for the pulled-pork, are extremely cheap. Be sure to ask for bread and put some of Phil's sauce right on it, instead of butter. So, so good. I could almost drink it.

Phil's has become my go-to suggestion when people are asking about somewhere to eat when they're downtown. The hours are a little funky, so be sure to check the website before making the trip."}
{"text":"** 3.5 Stars **

I first heard of Phil's like through Restaurant Makeover and after seeing the chef sent to teach Phil about making dishes come up with nothing since everything tasted so good, I had to put this place on my must-go-to list.BBQ for me is a summer food, you need that weather otherwise you can't possibly enjoy the true beauty of the meat, and so I waited 4 months and finally went a couple days ago.

What surprised me were the prices, full slab of ribs $26 or a rack with 2 sides for $22, a BBQ combo for $23 (quarter chicken, 3 ribs and a bit of brisket with 2 sides). We ended up getting a pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ combo just so we could taste a bit of everything. The ribs were good (8/10) - a little dry but overall tasty. Chicken was seasoned well and tasted good but the brisket didn't really impress. The highlight of the dinner ended up being the BBQ Beans which were amazing (probably because of the chicken and pork hidden between them)!

Overall Phil obviously knows how to BBQ but given the rather high price, I was expecting a bit more. 

On a side note I have to say the sweet BBQ sauce they have on the table is SO GOOD, I'm tempted to go back and buy a couple bottles and put it on EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the BBQ for some time now and was passing by today and found a parking spot nearby.  It was past the lunch time rush, so it wasn't busy, but I wanted a sandwich to go anyway.

Although I love pulled pork, the brisket was calling out to me today.  It was great.  Wonderful smokey flavour with a good crust.  Super moist with just the right amount of fat.  

I wish that they had baked beans as a side, but I took the fries which were OK.  Next time I will try either the potato salad or cole slaw."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent service and great tasting food.  I strongly recommend the beef briskit - very very tasty in a savoury sauce."}
{"text":"Gotta love Phil's... The pulled pork sandwich is amazing (the only thing I order.) And the sauce is equally as delicious! At like, $7.99 for a pulled pork sandwich + fries, you really can't go wrong...

Also, their \"hushpuppies\" are definitely worth a try.  I think they are just deep-fried cornbread balls... so good. The honey mustard-y sauce they come with is also worth mentioning.

4.5 stars in my books!"}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed my experience when I was first introduced to it; I liked the fact that the owner was present and serving at the restaurant.  
I found the food absolutely divine! The Cachapas actually sent me on a mission back to the location however this is were the tale takes a darker turn for me. 

I looked up on the website what I thought was all the information I would need however what I failed to find out is that this location closes for several hrs between lunch and dinner and this information is not easy to find either. needless to say I was incredibly dissappointed when I finally arrived at the restaurant to find out I would have to wait about an hr and a half for it to open again! This info should be right on the main page of the website or at least readily available to customers because that literally was a ridiculous waste of time that could have been saved by sharing a little info with the public.
Other then that the location itself is hard for me to get to and there is NO parking.. I'm not a fan of having to pay for street parking to eat at an establishment.

Overall I really did enjoy the food quality, portions and price as well as the service but there are a few things they need to work out for it to be a reliable BBQ option for me"}
{"text":"Phil's is my go to place if I can't bear the thought of cooking or if I have very little time to get food in my belly. 
A Restaurant Makeover success story (because we all know those are somewhat rare) I have to pretend it's not nearly across the street from me in order to ensure that I don't make myself sick on BBQ. 
Their prices have slowly climbed and in my mind the taste factor has diminished. I don't eat pork so I can't tell you how good or bad it is, but the last few times I have eaten there I have found the brisket sandwich to be dry and lacking of flavour.  One saving grace is all of their sides are yummy and the hush puppies are to die for.  Their service is also a bit scatterbrained,and there seems to be a help wanted sign on the window quite often.  
 
Nevertheless,give it a spin if you want quick, still affordable  and simple barbeque."}
{"text":"In a town that is seriously lacking BBQ it's nice that we have Phil's because it is really quite tasty. I'm incredibly disappointed that it doesn't live up to what I want it to be.

I hadn't eaten Phil's for 4+ years until last night and now recall the two reasons I stopped going there.

1. when they got hit by the Pimp my Restaurant thing the burners were changed and the food tastes like natural gas.

2. MSG - I was up half the night and have spent the entire day in an MSG anxiety/heart rate attack. 

I guess the next BBQ chicken I have will be from NYC if not the South itself."}
{"text":"I like Phil's. It's a no fuss kinda place.

I stopped by here for a Saturday night dinner, and the place was busy, but we were still able to get a table without reservations no problem. 

The ambiance is nice - very typical for that kind of place. Before going there I didn't know it had been on a restaurant makeover show, but having watched a few in my day, it really does look like it has had a professional makeover - the decor and the menu really reminded me of something you would see on a Gordan Ramsay show (post makeover, of course!). 

The menu is small, which I appreciate - the main courses are ribs (large or small), chicken, pulled pork, or brisket - and you get to choose 2 of 4 sides (i obviously went with the fries and baked beans, unhealthy options are the best!). 

I had the pulled pork, but I did get to try the ribs, and I REALLY wish I had got them. The pulled pork was great, but ribs are just... so much better. The fries were nothing special, but the baked beans were AWESOME! There was some kind of meat baked in - maybe pork - which meant that every few bites were extra delicious. 

My only real complaint about this place is the drink selection - since my options were limited to 4 beers, I went with water. I'd love to see some craft beers show up here!

Overall, my first new neighbourhood experience was a good one, thanks to Phil's!"}
{"text":"We went to Phil's BBQ today after finding out that sadly, our favourite place, Highway 61 has closed down back in July. I had heard a lot of good things about the place, however, after reading the reviews here and other places, I wasn't so certain I wanted to try it but the boyfriend convinced me and so we went.

The place was nice, it smelled smokey and delicious in there and the service was pretty good. The waiter was quick, almost too pushy (I got a bit of the \"order already, I ain't got all day\" vibe from him) but overall not too bad.

We got served within a reasonable time period (about 15-20 min.). 

I ordered the ribs, in fact most of us did, except my boyfriend who tried the pulled pork. 

The food: the ribs had a nice bark on them, the flavour was definitely there. Smokey, not too overwhelming, and not oversauced. The fries were light golden brown and crispy and fluffy on the inside. Big too! Very nice. The beans were amazing. That's the main thing I've heard about and they did not disappoint. They were smokey, had pieces of meat in them, just sweet enough and melt in your mouth. Delicious.

Now the negatives (mostly about food): the ribs, aside from the flavour were tough. They were not fall off the bone in any way, they were very chewy and hard to get through. It's too bad really because otherwise they would've been very good. 

The sauce was slightly too acidic for my liking, but that might be a personal preference. I like a good sweetness balance to my rib sauce.

The potato salad I got as another side was disappointing too. The chunks of potato were huge and undercooked. There was not much else aside from the big pieces of potato in the salad and it was a bit bland.

My boyfriend's pulled pork was very stringy, chewy and oversauced. Disappointing as well.

Overall, when I go to a BBQ restaurant and the beans are my favourite thing on the plate, that's a bit sad. A lot of places can do good beans but not everyone can do good ribs and meat. 

I don't think I will be coming back to Phil's, sadly and will have to keep looking for a replacement to Highway 61, RIP."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I went here a few months back (twice- apparently didn't learn the first time)and I will never return. The food had very little flavour and tasted old. I have eaten at many genuine barbecue shops and this doesn't compare. There is no love put into the food, it doesn't taste slow roasted. I would not recommend eating here. I really don't understand all the positive comments, maybe paid family members- ha ha"}
{"text":"Phil's is less like a restaurant and more like a beloved friend (not that I actually know the man himself that well, but his food is great company). Another place that is practically in my backyard, and was never visited for the first half of my four-year College St.-west-of-Ossington (a neighbourhood I am now, at this second, christening \"Co-Wos\") tenure. 
Not for lack of wanting, though. It just never seemed to be open when we needed it to, and I think we assumed it was out of our price range (which it so isn't). 

It is one of my favourite places to go, both sit-down and take-out. The menu is pretty basic, and I can honestly say I have had everything on it. Wow. For sit-ins, I favour going all out, ordering the sample plate that offers a bit of everything: chicken, beef brisket, ribs-- you'll also need to buy a separate plate of pulled pork, cuz you really should try it. Last time, we also went for the Cachapas, which are like corn and cheese pancakes and blew my freaking mind. As a side, baked beans all the way, and the fries are a good meat-neutralizer, if needed. 

For take-out, I always go with the sandwiches, which offer the aforementioned meats, but on buns (duh), and come with a side for $6.95(!?) and are in my top 5 favourite comfort foods ever (the brisket is my constant choice). The hush puppies are a little hard (but I'm no hush-puppies expert so maybe that's how they should be?), and the sauce is a little delicious and you can even buy it to take home. I would starve, or be very unhappy, without this place."}
