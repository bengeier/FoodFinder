{"text":"Stop reading and go here, you will not be disappointed.  Can I give them 10 Stars?!?!  We had the BIG Dam and carne asada burrito.  Delicious.  Absolutely delicious!  Salsas were so authentic, light and complimentary to the meal.  My picky son had the cheeseburger and zero complaints."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around.. You can always tell good Mexican food by their rice and beens. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's about time. This is the best food in Boulder City. Any one wanting street tacos or burgers go here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for our first visit here and so happy to have a good Mexican food truck in BC. First greeted by very friendly couple who were extremely helpful. I asked if they had veggie tacos and they said they did not have them on the menu but would make some for me if I told them what I wanted. I opted instead for a couple chicken tacos with rice & beans. They were good, not the best I've ever had but solid for sure. My friend ordered the pork tacos and she really enjoyed them. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"WOW! This is the hidden gem in Boulder City! If you want authentic street tacos or even gringo tacos this is the place. Burrito's are great. The pulled pork in anything is to die for! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. People are very nice and I would recommend to anyone wanting something tasty."}
{"text":"This place has the most authentic street tacos I've found in Nevada. If you don't stop here on your way to the Hoover Dam you may as well drive your minivan directly into Lake Mead, because you'll never forgive yourself. We had the Big Dam Burrito, Carne Asada Burrito and the aforementioned street tacos. Not only was all the food delicious, but it was super reasonably priced. The Big Dam Burrito was so big I had to take a walk around the block after eating it. If you go for lunch I hope you don't have dinner plans, because you definitely won't be hungry for the rest of the day. We will definitely stop by the taco truck again next time we are in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing ! We are from California and we have had trouble finding good Mexican food here in Nevada and we loved everything!

A little tip for the owners ;) if the foil was facing down on the lid maybe the cheese wouldn't stick as much"}
