{"text":"This Steak Frites gives the chain a bad name.  I have been to others, and they were fantastic.  This one, however, is absolutely terrible.  There are a bunch of servers standing around doing seemingly nothing at all.  For those of you that don't know, it's a bring your own wine steak restaurant.  Your steak comes with all you can eat fries; the servers come by with bowls of fries.    I was there with a group of about 12 people for a friend's birthday.  I ordered the 9oz steak, whereas my friend sitting across from me ordered the 7oz.  When our orders arrived, I immediately noticed that my steak was much smaller than my friend's, and was clearly not cooked to the temperature I had requested.  I asked the food runner to explain why my steak was much smaller than my friend's, considering that I ordered the larger steak.  She insisted that my order was correct and walked away.  As I sat there stunned for a moment, the original server came by to see how things were, and I voiced my concerns to him.  He admitted that my steak did not look right, and was over cooked (I had ordered it medium rare).  He took it back to the kitchen.  To my surprise, the same steak came back on a different plate with vegetables missing, delivered by the same food runner as earlier.  I once again told them that this steak is not what I ordered, and requested that they fire a new steak for me, 9oz and medium rare.  As the steak was returned to the kitchen again, I saw the servers and kitchen staff discussing my order.  After another wait, my steak finally is brought to the table.  By that time, the rest of my entourage had finished their meals, and the table was being cleared.  When I asked if I could get some fries to go with my steak (the restaurant is called Steak Frites, after all), I was told that the kitchen was closed.  To my surprise, my bill came, full charge, no compensation for the mix up with my order or for not serving me fries with my meal.  Obviously, I left no tip.  When the server noticed that I did not leave a tip, he asked if there was a problem.  Seriously???  I will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I am very surprise that people love this place. The steak did not taste good, I took one bite and that was it. It tasted like no seasoning... And not like quality food. I only ate the fries and it was just OK with a lot of mayo I guess. The waiter was also making me uncomfortable. Its seems like doing his job was painful... If you wanna go to a real steak house go to the keg. Don't waste your money for that. Honestly if you like steak frite and give it 5 stars trying a real steak house after will probably be a revelation for you."}
{"text":"Rudest service I've ever had anywhere. This location is in the heart of the gay village where everyone speaks English.  A group of us on a business trip went for dinner at this location.  When the waitress figured out that I was the only non-French speaker at the table she would only speak to me in rapid-fire French delivered inches from my face.  She didn't even speak to the others at the table; I  became her spokesperson for the table.  It became clear she was trying to humiliate the Anglophone.  To add injury to the insult, rather than using the wide aisle to navigate her section, she would squeeze into the 10 inch gap between our table and the next. She had her ass in my face for most of the evening jostling me every time she passed.  She knocked drinks over a couple times too.  The others at the table chastised her in French but she completely ignored them.  Needless to say, we couldn't get out of there fast enough and didn't bother with a tip.    Save yourself from abusive service and a horrible experience - stay far away from this location!"}
{"text":"What a horrible place. First the positive thing(s): the decor was nice.  Ok, now to the drag: The service was awful, the prices were ridiculous for what you got, the plating was similar to a chain production, with servers walking around with a bowl of fries literally throwing it on your plate while walking by. I had a filet mignon at $36 and hoped it would be worth it. But it was far from that. It was not even grilled on fire, but on a hot plate. It was around 4 ounces and prepared obviously by a giant batch processing, not tender and seared way to deep and dry as a fart.  The plating was to trow some green beans on the plate with some (very creative) raw tomatoes on the side and the steak thrown on top of that. The plate was a mediocre diner plate passed through the dishwasher for a 1000 times.  The server passed by with a big bowl of greasy fries and with a pair of tongues thew it on everyone's plate. This is the typical wannabe upscale restaurant obviously owned and operated by people that don't give a damn to their guests and food quality, hoping for suckers such as me to fall into their trap. Never again, thanks"}
{"text":"I came here to accompany family who was visiting and wanted to eat steak in the Village. There are absolutely no vegetarian options. Even though salad was part of the meal if your ordered a steak or seafood, they wouldn't sell me a salad separately, even though there was nothing else I could eat. It wasn't really busy or anything, as it was a Tuesday night. As a bonus, the waiter spilled water and food on my bag, and white blouse. They did not offer to pay for my dry cleaning. Really bad experience! Maybe the food isn't bad, but management really needs to learn to be nicer to their patrons."}
{"text":"No reviews yet?  This was a great place to eat, great service, good food, and they let you bring your own wine in.  Simple menu but only because the specialize in one thing...steak and frites :)  I particularly like the endless bowl of fries.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, try the steak frites and bring your own bottle of wine - no corking fee!  Steak was okay but fries/sauce were great an very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Good, not great.  For a place that's called Steak Frite, their steaks and fries should be exceptional. They were both just average. The French onion soup was outstanding though. Service was friendly if a little slow. I'd probably not choose Steak Frite again, however if I were invited I would go."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble on this place while walking thru gay village. I was so pleasantly surprised with their food and service. Our server informed us we could bring our own wine. Nice that there was no corking fee and places to buy wine close by. I got the 7 ounce steak and it came with unlimited fries and green beans. You get your choice of one of three sauces and I picked the mushroom sauce, and I was very happy with my choice. The meal also included salad and bread. All for $23 and All delicious! Steak was very tender and cooked to order. I liked they have a tapas dessert menu. Perfect sized portion of sweetness. One of the best meals I had in Montreal. The ambience was nice too."}
{"text":"After countless happy hour drinks in the Village, we stumbled upon Steak Frites.  Place was packed on Friday night, but we walked right in and was able to get seated instantly. The restaurant is fun and fresh, and good for either a date or night out with friends.  As soon as we were seated, the waiter brought out the menu. Btw, it's BYOB. We ordered the calamari and pate as appetizers. The calamari was really good and the pate was outstanding.  For my main entrée, I ordered the filet mignon (with peppercorn sauce). The steak was a bit overdone.  I usually order medium or medium/well, but it was beyond well! It came with a side of string beans and obviously, the endless frites! I honestly wish the string beans could have been replaced with another vegetable.  The string beans were a bit bland and the fries were not crispy enough. Portion was sized perfectly. I didn't leave overly stuffed but wasn't hungry either.  Service was sometimes slow but the water was really nice. Prices were also a little high. But overall, a good place to have dinner on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Perfect, right on St. Catherine's.  Summer outside, with a BYOB, plenty of SAC (liquor stores) close by. Nice food, good service, right on prices.....overall totally worth a visit !"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I wanted some streak and frites. So, this place definitely satisfied our craving. Plus, I love that this place is BYOW, so two of them purchased two bottles of red wine while my other friend and I got us a table. It's a trendy, classy place, but not over the top pretentious either.   Although this place is probably know for steak, I ordered confit de canard (or duck confit). And it was quite tasty, juicy, and nicely seasoned. Also, the entree came with endless, bottomless frites.. so we were definitely full, buzzed, and happy. Oh, and we also shared escargot with cheese, which eh.. I don't think the cheese went well, so I wouldn't recommend it.   Great dinner all around. Thank you, Steak Frite in my favorite Canadian city (so far), Montreal. :)"}
{"text":"Steak Frites is a small, reliable chain that has an outpost in Montreal's gay Village. I don't know much about their other restaurants, but this one has a pleasant gay vibe that is in keeping with the ambiance of the area. Outdoor dining was enjoyable and scenic. The service was friendly, although a bit erratic. The waiter had a beatific smile which made up for a multitude of sins. My companion and I had escargots gratine for appetizers and it was quite tasty. He had a filet mignon and I had the rack of lamb for entrees. I love lamb and this was well prepared and seasoned. The unlimited \"frites\" are a nice gimmick although they were hardly necessary in terms of the generous cuts of meat. We both declined dessert, had coffee, and then went off dancing to seek the next cut of meat."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a Saturday night. Arrived on time and our table was pre set and ready for us. We ordered the calamari appetizer and flank steak main entree. The entree's are served with a dinner salad as well as a heaping of Crispy French fried and a seasonal vegetable. Everything was perfectly seasoned and delicious. Steak came out medium as we requested. The service was well paced and attentive. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Sorry but my surf and turf was way below par! The filet was gamey (fine with the sauce they offer in several flavors), the grilled prawn undercooked. The sea scallop was grilled well however and the escargots in cheese appetizer was good. The creme brulee delicious. ( it was gay pride Sunday and busy but that shouldn't be an excuse)"}
{"text":"The food here was FANTASTIC!  The service.... could have been better.  While enjoying my vacation in Montreal and walking down the Rue de Saint Catherine, we came across this elegant-looking steak restaurant.  Everything looked so formal!  It was a bit on the pricey side, but... when in Rome... (or Montreal)..  First off, it's a BYOB restaurant, so I'm a little confused as to why the staff was all jumbled together behind a bar with no alcohol...  We waited for 15 minutes before actually being greeted and asked how many were in our party.  Obviously there was 2 of us.  She waved her hand and said, \"Okay, I'll be back in a few minutes\" - she then proceeded to play the part of waitress as well as hostess.  She took 3 tables orders before once again approaching us and then pointing over to a table that was empty and telling us to sit there.  Upon waiting for someone to come over with wine glasses, I was disturbed to find crusty remains on all of my silverware - gross!  After telling the server, I was told that I could bring my silverware to the hostess station and wait for someone to replace them - um what?  So finally, after waiting a while, someone came over and started working the seating chart machine thing... I tried to get her attention, but she put her finger up and told me to wait.  Then, she finally acknowledged my need for clean silverware and obliged.  The food was delicious.  The steaks were cooked to perfection - and are served with unlimited fries.  Each bite was juicy and tender.  Yum!  The checkout was pretty basic, nothing to really dwell upon.  I wish the service was better here - they truly are not living up to the potential of this aesthetically elegant restaurant with a clearly talented culinary team."}
{"text":"Good food and better than average service in the heart of Montreal's Village area (Quartier Latin).  Try the Chateaubriand for two or my favorite, a rib steak.  They'll bring you fries until you pop if you don't tell them to stop.  Don't forget to get a bottle of wine and take it with you before you go (SAQ, the liquor store in Quebec, is a block west of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant and the atmosphere here was fabulous. It was our last night in Montreal and after walking around gay village we were absolutely famished. The place was packed and we were fortunate enough to score a table on the patio after waiting only a few minutes. We waited quite some time to get our menus but that can be easily forgiven since the food was really delicious. Service was somewhat slow but they were very nice. We ordered the escargots, steak frites and the duck confit. The escargots were the best i have ever tasted. They were so plump and juicy and the garlic oil was to die for. I soaked it all up using the complimentary bread. The steak that my friend had was cooked to perfection. She wanted it medium rare and that was exactly how it was served. The meat was so juicy and tender. My duck confit was also really delicious, the meat was flavorful and very tender. What I love about food in Montreal is how fresh it is and that they put great care into everything they prepare. All the ingredients are fresh and that is why everything tastes so wonderful. If I visit Montreal again I would definitely come back. And oh! they have unlimited fries with all entrees. The fries are not that amazing, but hey, you can get as much of it as you want. Can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Happened to go here for a group dinner for a friends birthday. Let me tell you, not worth your money. Don't waste your time spending money for shit food.  Horrible.   I'd rather eat a Taco Bell burrito out of a homeless mans mouth."}
{"text":"The worst service I've received in my life. Waited for 25 five minutes to place and order, and that was only because I stopped one of the waiters. After that, the bread basket, passed through three different tables before it got to it's final destination, my table (the busgirl had no idea where she had to drop off the bread). It took them 50 minutes to get the order to our table. And an extra 10 minutes to realize, I had no fork to eat with.  When I asked to speak to the manager or the person in charge, they told me \"we're in charge\". I think the worst part is that it was my spouse's birthday, AND our first time at Steak Frite St Paul (Ste. Catherine st.).  I will never visit this restaurant again, and I'll make sure to tell everyone I know to not go there."}
{"text":"Located not far from Metro Beaudry, in the gay Village, it a BYOB place located not far from the SAQ. Good for groups and families, they have courteous and friendly staff, nice clean bathrooms...the food is a whole different story: soggy brown fries, cooked in overly recycled oil, tasteless meats and a rack of lamb that looked like a shank.  I really hope they improve the quality of their food"}
{"text":"Alan and I walked down here for dinner.  Several of the other restaurants we were interested in were closed tonight.  Steak Frîtes is a small chain, about 16 restaurants mostly in Eastern Canada.  They have no liquor license apparently because patrons are encouraged to bring their own wine and there were many bottles of wine in evidence.  We drank water.  The restaurant is housed in a large room w/ high ceilings.  The wall on one side was red brick.  It's divided up into smaller spaces via a few very attractive room dividers made of wrought iron and plexiglass.  Light fixtures are suspended from metal racks which are in turn suspended from the ceiling.  We were greeted and seated at a table for two by one of the room dividers.  Chalkboard menus written in French are strategically posted around the room so they can be read from any vantage point.  As is usual in Montreal we were addressed in French by our server, Marc, who switched to English when we indicated that was the language we spoke.  He brought us menus in English.  We were interested in calamari as a starter, but wanted to know if there were tentacles.  There ensued a charades-like communication, which culminated in Marc wiggling his fingers to indicate that there were tentacles.  He was adorable.  In addition to the calamari we each ordered steak frîtes, which came w/ salad, sauteed vegetables and endless frîtes.  We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms.  We were brought a basket containing two very hot rolls w/ butter.  The rolls were very good.  The calamari arrived and it was among the best we've had.  The batter was crisp and flavorful and the calamari was meltingly tender.  The salads were simple, w/ butter lettuce, slices of red onion and dressing.  We were offered more rolls but declined.  The steaks arrived, both medium rare, mine more toward rare while Alan's was more toward medium.  The accompanying vegetables were tiny haricot verts w/ a couple of pear tomatoes.  The steaks were very tasty.  At Marc's suggestion we had a little sauce on the side, but the meat was so good the sauce was unnecessary.  The vegetables were very good.  The mushrooms were a pleasure  The frîtes were disappointing, lukewarm and not particularly interesting.  I was happy to skip them but Alan wanted them hot, so he asked for more that were fresher.  The frîtes server came around w/ his bowl and gave me more then started to walk away.  Alan called him back, indicating he wanted some too.  They were better than the first batch, but still not that good.  The rest of the meal overshadowed the disappointing frîtes and we were pleased."}
{"text":"Perfect resto in the gay village for Steak and great fries!!!! Also it's nice because you can bring your own wine :)  This is place is perfect for groups or just a nice meal with friends. The menu is quite simple but executed well.   In the summer, the resto had one of the best patio to eat outdoor while the street is close for pedestrians only.  Steak Frite est une valeur sûre !!!"}
{"text":"Just not the same as Steak Frites. The waiter was attentive and friendly, but the other service was ok. Steak was fine. The signature lemon pepper sauce and signature frites are no more. I commented to the waiter who told me the company changed and could no longer use the same sauces for trademark and was cost savings on the unlimited fries from before.   My steak: med - tender. The pepper sauce from before would have kept me coming back more. Pervious visits I would come 3-4 times a trip. Now, meh. Possibly once a trip I'll consider the location.  It was pretty empty when we arrived at 930 on a Thursday night. The salad was good, bread was fresh.   The restroom sadly- disgusting.   Bring back Steak Frites!"}
{"text":"They were clearly understaffed as the service was slow and infrequent.  We came here hoping to get great steaks but were left very disappointed since we decided on a ribeye steak, supposedly a premium cut. Ordered medium-rare and it was served medium-well. The waiter didn't bother checking with the done-ness when serving probably because they always overcook their steaks? Only reason why we didnt bother returning it was to avoid food wastage.   On the other hand, the duck confits are perfectly cooked. Will not mind going back for the duck but definitely not for their steaks. They should probably rename themselves to Confit Frites?"}
{"text":"Francais après  I put 3 but for me it's really 3 and a half. First of all, you must understand that I'm not a fan of steakhouse. However this place reminds me more of a mix with steakhouse and bistro with a trendy tone to it. I guess it would match people that are into Bière & Compagnie and The Keg. Average-loud music which is okay for what we did. I went there with a group for the «Almost-Birthday» of my good friend. We waited for people to arrive so I was getting hungry and irritated about not receiving any bread of something at the very begining (a typical Steakhouse thing normally). So apart from waiting, for a 2 floors restaurants with an impressive capacity, it was super packed but almost quite fast and well run menu  I had the crabcake which was good but somehow not crispy enough to my taste. On the plus side, the crab was really tender and somehow moist, not dry at all. I then took the Confit de Canard (Duck Confit) which was pretty decent. very standard bistro portion. IMO an apetizer is needed. Overall, 50$ . It's a Bring-Your-Wine restaurant so because there's a certain tendancy and a crowd that is please by that, it gets a lot of regular, a lot of young (24-45) clients. Also corporate and somehow well dressed. So for me it really feel like a classy restaurant for people that don't know food! but that's just me bitching a little. The food was good but it's been done everywhere. The success and the popularity of this is mainly due to the fact it's a small franchise with a lot of Success because of their concept that's a cross between a simplified steakhouse but with a bistro twist to it. honnest price. Somehow the lack of WOW factor is the reason why I gave 3 stars.  Oh last thing: Good homefries and it's all-you-can-eat fries! So if you're in deep need of homefries, this is your place...AND THE WAITRESS was beauuuuuuuuuttiful and quite nice too!  J'ai mis 3 étoile mais en fait je leur donne réellement 3 étoiles et demi. Premièrement il faut comprendre que je ne suis pas un très grand adepte des Steakhouse. Pourquoi? Bah, je suis capable de faire ça chez nous facilement. Aussi bon sinon mieux! Pourquoi je voudrais me casser le bécyk pour du steak?  Cet endroit me rappelle un mixte entre The Keg et Bière et Compagnie (Sans les moules!). Mais bon, je suis allé à la z«Presque-fête» de mon bon ami puis on a attendu un bon 20 minutes avant l'Arrivée de tout notre monde. Je commençais à avoir vraiment faim et à m'impatienter un peu. Une fois la prise des commandes complétées nous n'avons pas attendus longtemps. C'est un resto de 2 étages et c'était remplit à craqué (avec les party de bureaux c'est normal). Il y avait une clientèle de 24-45 relativement bien habillé.   Enfin, j'ai commandé la croquette aux crabes ( un crabcake) . Pas assez croustillant à mon goût mais une belle texture moelleuse au crabe à l'intérieur. Ensuite j'ai pris le confit de canard. Le plat principal vient avec une petite salade sans prétention . Le confit était bien. Les portions me portent à croire qu'une entrée est nécessaire à un bon repas complet. Juste le met principal c'est un peu mince voir petit. Les desserts sont pas mal  non plus. Pour moi cet endroit attire une clientèle qui ne connaissent pas vraiment la bouffe ou plutôt un endroit «safe» pour invité les gens difficiles. De plus, c'est une petite franchise qui attire une clientèle apportez votre vin. C'est très populaire pour une certaine clientèle à Montréal. C'est une bonne place pour un party corporatif ou party de bureau. C'est un endroit safe moyennement dispendieux dans le fond. Ahh oui, pis notre serveuse était vraiment mignonne en plus d'être très gentille. Ce n'est vraiment pas mauvaise, au contraire, c'est simplement que j'aime prendre un plus grand risque dans un nouveau resto que j'Essaye puis un steakhouse me laisse toujours un peu déçu sur cet aspect."}
{"text":"Staying down by the gay village and wanted to try this place for a great steak and frites meal. Bring your own bottle wine if you want to drink with no corkage fee, food was fantastic with my steak cooked perfect, desert selection is good.  The service was good right up till the end. After paying for an $70 meal, not including alcohol, the server questioned the amount of tip I left. For starters tip is optional and second I decide how much to leave not the server.  I was told it is customary to leave 15% tip and questioned as to why I did not. If I did it again...zero tip!  I would have have a 4 star rating but the top issue left a sour taste in my mouth. I would not return to this restaurant when so many other great restaurants are in the area."}
