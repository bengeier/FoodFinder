{"text":"This was the worst buffet I have been to yet! The food was old and odd tasting. When I go to a buffet I expect mediocre food but this stuff was inedible. We went there because we got a Bogo coupon in the mail that had multiple pictures of crab legs on it which left me to believe there would be crab legs for the dinner buffet. There were not. I've never been scared that I might get food poisoning from something I ate until tonight. I'm crossing my fingers I don't.  This is the first time I left a buffet still hungry because I couldn't stand to eat more than one bite of anything I tried. The atmosphere was really weird too. There was music playing and tv's playing prime time shows with the volume on. I'm just glad that I had the coupon and didn't pay full price or I would have been really bummed. Never again!"}
{"text":"Remodeled very nicely. New management and staff are friendly and polite. The prices are very reasonable. The selection is huge and everything was delicious. I'm very glad that we decided to try this place since it has been redone and new ownership/ management. Prices vary by times and days so that there is something for every budget. Keep up the good work people, you have some very happy clients in our family."}
{"text":"When we first come at the time they open the food was very good,  We have eaten here now 4 times and today eing Christmas,  this will be the last time we will eat here . The crab legs very small, many of  the foods were very cold and dry out.  There have been fewer people at the buffet everytime we were here.  It is time for us to find a better chinese buffet with bigger and better crab legs."}
{"text":"Good food, buffet style. Restaurant is very empty for a Friday night, could be because it's Halloween. Some items in the buffet are not labeled so minus one star. Happy otherwise!"}
{"text":"Good service... Food surprisingly good!! Definitely coming back!!! They have a Hibachi station with many choices can't wait to try it"}
{"text":"This is yet another buffet reboot in this corner of Papago Plaza and may benefit from a few more polishing touches, but for now it is pretty decent. It should be noted that  to get food at its best, one should come to a buffet at opening time - and with that caveat, it should be noted that I came at a later time (1:30 pm). Nevertheless, considering that it is newly opened and should be trying to impress, I had hoped to get superb quality. The food, as I have mentioned, is decent but the quality varies from dish to dish. For example, the clams in broth, the egg foo yung, and some of the grilled meats were very good while the main buffet standards such as chicken and shrimp dishes varied from good to mediocre; and there were a few misses such as the the salt and pepper squid with lacked both salt and pepper. The fresh salads were good, though I wish the dressing would be a bit more tangy. There was an ample choice of good desserts, including a chocolate fountain. I plan to give them another try soon after they've worked out the kinks that come with being a newly-opened establishment."}
{"text":"Discrete food and service.  But they should regulate the temperature on their hot table. Everything is overcooked."}
{"text":"the service here was great but it is slightly declining with every visit, (losing that newcar smell) I believe I will probably go out of my way to travel 15 mi back to my regular joint."}
{"text":"Decided to try this tonight because we received a coupon for a free meal. My advice - it's not worth going even if it's free.  We were greeted and seated. With many empty tables around, we were seated at one that was dirty and sticky. When I asked about beer choices, the hostess had to look across the restaurant at the cooler. Served beer with chilled glasses, but we opted to drink out of the cleaner looking bottles.  Food was sub-par, at best. Nothing was great, or even good. My son, who will literally eat just about everything and loves all manner of Asian food, went for the pizza after trying several options. I've never seen him leave so much on his plate!  Many of the options weren't labeled, like the flavors of ice cream, sushi rolls, etc. One thing that weirded me out - the chocolate fountain with marshmallows sat right next to the marinated octopus.  Not so appetizing!   The ambiance was similar to an old Kmart diner, especially the lighting. There was masking tape covering holes in the wall and post - it notes numbering the tables. The wire mesh condiment holders on the tables still had the price tags on them.  I could continue, but there is no point. Won't ever return."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in on the grand opening and were the only one's there. All the food was cold ,the noodles were gummy ,and customer service wasn't all that great.We both agreed to give them another chance if we ever see the place filled with customers because the food is bearable and its close by the house."}
{"text":"People who come here expecting China Chili or Flo's, go elsewhere. This is a \"buffet\". Where I come from, there are lots of these places and they are generally the same. And I mean THE SAME. Like the desserts and some items are strangely alike from place to place. I went here because it was free. I brought with me an Asian friend. And I was going to give it three stars but I was reminded that this is better than the average Chinese buffet. I base this on the fact that it has a free grill, and a sushi bar is available. They also serve alcohol. Big plus. The décor is really nice, place is new and clean. The décor includes some really cool full sized horse statues, neon vaulted ceiling, and nice muraled walls. Booths and tables available, the space is HUGE. The service was great. I mean, it is the same experience I would have on the East coast. Nothing is going to win any awards but the food was hot, varied, and the place was clean. I mean where else do you take someone to try \"everything\" on a Chinese menu. It was fine. As jusged by buffet standards, and when I was in college, and poor, we did this a lot."}
{"text":"Food was fairly cold, came here because my parents wanted to have those all you can eat crab which was completely unfresh, but what can you expect from a 10 dollar buffet? The only thing that was decently good was from the habachi grill and the 2.79 beer which was great but apart from that, server was meh. And the oyster was dry as well. 2 stars cause of the beer though."}
{"text":"The only warm food I got tonight was my sushi..."}
{"text":"WOW what an improvement! I did not believe my boyfriend when he said they changed everything about the buffet from the 2 prior buffets that had gone wayyyy down hill.  A complete remodel and different layout. Large flat screen TV's around the restaurant (when is the last time you saw TV's an all you can eat buffet??)  The food is SO much better and fresh."}
{"text":"As of February 2, 2015 it is closed.  Too bad, because we were just there in January, and it was fine.  My previous review still applied. We had no problems."}
{"text":"Top five best places in the planet.  I travel all over and this is the best buffet I've ever had also amazing price"}
{"text":"Great buffet. I loved being able to make my own noodles. Also the service was great and the food was fresh. I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"First of all, who trains the wait staff here?!? I've come a few times and the service is disastrous! Going 20 minutes without water is atrocious when there's only 4 other tables. Also, leaving the check on the table is fine when we aren't even halfway done eating, but to then interrupt our conversation 10 minutes later and ask that we pay the bill now, is rude. And whoever their male server is...is the worst! He brings you the check, takes your card and then hovers over your shoulder when you're filling out the receipt. What is wrong with you?! Like I said, who allows to let these people serve!  Xnejfieokefnfilwnrr Anyways, the buffet food is actually pretty okay,especially for 8.00 a lunch. They have fresh shrimp, a sushi bar (basic rolls) and then everything they have a typical Chinese lunch buffet, they also have a chocolate fountain which I haven't tried, I don't know how sanitary that is when I've seen little kids sticking their fingers in it. No thank you. They have a habachi grill as well, where you get to choose your ingredients and they cook it for you, but both times I've eaten from it my food was extremely overcooked and inedible. I may come back to get a to-go box, 1lb is 4.75, much cheaper to get a pound of fresh shrimp here than it is at the grocery store. Just saying.  But the service here....yuck."}
