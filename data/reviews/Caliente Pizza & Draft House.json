{"text":"Tried stopping in a couple times before after the Pub and Pizza became Caliente, but it was too crowded to get in. Stopped in tonight and it wasn't crowded at all. I guess the novelty of a new place has started to wear off.

I wanted to like this place, but found very little to like.  Few things were done to update the decor, other than painting the walls black (why???) and replacing most of the Pgh sports memorabilia with beer signs. Oh, I almost forgot, they removed all the tables and games (such as air hockey) from the back room to add beer coolers. This place is a hybrid between a bar, a 6 pack shop, and a restaurant. It really seems like they don't know what their identity is.

We had their zucchini planks, which were by far the greasiest and soggiest fried zucchini I have ever had. The pizza was actually fairly decent, but not outstanding. The beer selection was just weird. The draft selection was full of very off the wall extremely high ABV beers. I very much like trying different and less common beers, but this was just a weird selection.  I also don't mind high ABV beers,  but you need to offer a variety. Only 2 beers on the draft menu tonight were low enough ABV to come in a pint glass. Most came in 8 ounce snifters.  If you want a bottle, you must get it yourself and they will do you the privilege of opening it.

All in all, I was extremely disappointed and found few redeeming qualities. Since I live nearby, I MAY get pizza for takeout, but I will not be dining in or visiting the bar again. Tempted to give this place one star, but feeling generous, so I'll go with two."}
{"text":"WORST. SEATS. EVER. Uncomfortable AF. Cheap looking. They're awful. Ikea furniture is cool but not for a public bar.  Now I understand why we were the other 2 people sitting at the bar.
Other than that, the beer selection was good. Bartender was very knowledgeable. Food was pretty good. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Pick another location if you can.  Friends and I stopped in for a drink and were greeted by a rude bartender and even more rude manager.  We like wheat beers so based on the draft list ordered a wheat beer.  It may have been listed as wheat but it was an IPA and hoppy as hell.  When we asked the manager if we could pick a different beer because the beer clearly shouldn't be listed as a wheat he told us we could buy another.  ITS A DRAFT. How about some customer service and just get a person a new drink to make them happy???  Instead we left and will spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"When I order an IPA beer I was shocked to see that it came in a 4 oz glass. What do you expect for $6?? Bartender was rude and the food was average at best. Mt. Lebanon has way better places to offer then this."}
{"text":"I live close to the restaurant so I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately that was not the case. Took forever for the bartender to acknowledge us, had to ask for a water multiple times, gave us the wrong pizza (order BBQ Chicken , got buffalo chicken) and the food was mediocre. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"I consider myself a fair person and I enjoy eating out. I recently tried Caliente  pizza and draft house.. If you see a good review for this place please go and see for yourself!!i order what is called a chicken Ranchero hoagie.. This was by far this worst hoagie I have ever tasted.. The bun was microwaved or stale.. it was pealing and hard on the edges.. the chicken was over cooked or microwaved and hard on the edges.. I think there was fake cheddar cheese, and what looked like soggy nasty fries. Too top it off the table was balanced with about 6 folded napkins and it still rocked back in-forth.. The floor was scary dirty, oh my so dirty under the table..

Please do not order the hoagie at this place or wear flip flops in because of the filthy floor."}
{"text":"First time here since it changed ownership. We waited 50min at lunch.My friends ordered hoagies they were just ok My fries were cold.chicken salad was good but hard to eat with plastic fork and knife. Ranch dressing was good. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"This location of Caliente is in a weird spot. Parking is kinda difficult to access. I just think this is a strange location and I can't exactly put my finger on why. There is a take out entrance near the parking lot. I couldn't find the main entrance. Staff seemed bored and not very knowledgeable about the beer they are serving. Food is kinda meh. Nothing extraordinary that blew my socks off. The happy is decent with half off drafts and $5 personal pizzas. So maybe I'll be back for that but definitely at the main location."}
{"text":"I dined here last night and was very pleased. We ordered a garden salad, French fries, hot wings and cheese pizza. The fries were fresh cut and delicious, the wings were the best I have eaten in Pittsburgh (they were also very spicy) and the pizza was solid.

Cons: it was very loud and the salad was from a bag. Using fresh salad ingredients is a must!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their spinach and feta pizza is superb. Fantastic craft beer selection. And great service! It's quickly becoming my go to  spot whether it's for a quick lunch or a few beers after work."}
{"text":"I was sucked in by the good craft beer draft menu... it is a decent selection of less common beers. I will not go back due to the average food and high cost.  The beer felt 30% to 50% overpriced and their odd selection of glassware felt like they were trying to disguise smaller-than-normal pours. My beer was $7 for what looked like an 8oz pour. The collaboration beer I wanted to try was $9... I ended up skipping a second beer. The food was just average. The pan Pizza ended up limp and toppings were oddly missing from the corner pieces (almost completely). The kids menu might be big-kid friendly but not very good for toddler aged kids."}
{"text":"The pizza was cold and tasted like cardboard. 
The beer was in cans.  Yuk
Ot always came in bottles before."}
{"text":"Very happy that this location FINALLY seems to be turning around! Caliente is SIGNIFICANTLY better than any other of the previous establishments. The interior is similar, although slightly freshened up. Draft beer selection was a let-down for being what they tout as a draw. My husband & I might be the only 30-somethings who don't LOVE extra extra hops, but come on, even the wheat was described as a \"Hoppy wheat.\" 
The wings were decent, honey siracha sauce was tasty, but they were fairly dry. Plain cheese pizza was solid. Dough was very fresh & sauce seemed so as well. My husband got a Steak Ranchero & really liked it. 
We will definitely return. This are of Mt Lebanon has been in desperate need of a decent casual dining/bar especially since the Saloon has horrendous food & service."}
{"text":"This was the worse experience I've ever had. It took 2 hours for delivery, the pizza was ice cold and soggy. Wings were cold and nasty. Called and they said I could have a discount off next order, or they could replace it. I told them to replace because I'll NEVER order again. Took another hour, they only replaced pizza, and it was still cold."}
{"text":"We tried Caliente for the first time tonight.  We ordered a garden salad and a supreme pizza.  We shared the garden salad as it is large enough for two people.  The salad was ok.  It really needs more veggies added to make it much better.  The pizza was good, but nothing that would make us crave it and make Caliente our go to place for pizza.  The beer selection is decent and prices are average.  Our waitress was really nice and helpful in choosing beers.  I agree with other reviews that real utensils/plates would be nice as well as the music is loud and it is too dark.  I think with some work, it could be a great addition to Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. The beer selection is always top notch and I haven't had a bad thing on the menu. The bartenders are really good and attentive and I haven't had a bad experience here in the times I've stopped in. One of the best places around for some good beer and pizza."}
{"text":"I decided to order take out and I was going to have it delivered. I literally live a mile from them. I ordered my medium size pizza at 7:50pm. I did not get it till 9:30pm, and it was barely warm when I got it. It wasn't even that good. I should of just walked there and back and I would of had it quicker. Very displeased."}
{"text":"Caliente, in my opinion, is just \"okay\". We've gotten delivery several times, and have also eaten in. I have never been impressed. $1.75 delivery is decent, but free is always better! I will say, delivery is pretty quick though.  
As for food, pizza and wings are average. By no means are they terrible, but nothing to brag about. I prefer my wings crispy and a thinner crust on pizza. Caliente wings aren't very crispy and their pizza crust is rather thick, which is probably why I'm not a huge fan. The house garden salad is great though. Vegetables are fresh and the portion is pretty large. 
Caliente also has a great beer selection, such a large variety. I see a lot of reviews raving about the buffalo chicken cheese bread, which I haven't had yet, so I think I am gonna have to give that a try!"}
{"text":"** FOOD POISONING **

I was looking for a new spot to eat lunch around Mt. Lebanon when I stumbled upon Caliente and figured I'd give it a shot.  All I had was a half dozen wings and some fries.  The food was alright, your typical pub food.  The service was s.l.o.w. - I was the ONLY ONE at the bar, and there was only one other table in the entire restaurant when I went in - and I still had to flag down the waitress for things like napkins, glasses of water, refills, my check, literally-any-time-I-needed-her, etc.

Now the good part.  About 1-2 hours after ingesting their sub-par food, I start burning up and feeling nauseous.  About 30 minutes after that, I run to the bathroom to throw up.  10 minutes later, I'm throwing up again, and again.  I leave work early to go home and rest... I throw up the entire rest of the evening. I throw up the entire next day afterwards. After 24 hours of constant nausea, I am able to keep water down, and eventually some ginger ale.  Considering it's not flu season, I sought answers elsewhere.

I come to Yelp and see that a few other reviews mention getting sick or contaminated food. I then go on to Allegheny Dept. of Health to see what their most-recent inspection was .. I'm surprised they haven't been shut down! There were almost 10 health violations, some of them being major infractions! 

This inspection has been included in this review. I will never, ever, be returning here - there are SOOOO many better options in the Mt. Lebanon and Castle Shannon area that have delicious food, good service, and won't make you deathly ill."}
{"text":"Bad service both when eating in or delivering. Management is very poor and it shows throughout. The food is actually pretty good, but with haphazard delayed service,  would rather take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"This isn't my first time ordering delivery from this location, but it is my last time. 

I ordered a large cheese pizza and breadsticks. Simple, right?  Well, 40 minutes later, the driver arrives. Great delivery time in my opinion!  

Here's where it gets bad. I open my pizza and find the entire pizza shoved in the corner of the box. Someone must have taken a sharp curve or something. 

Anyhoo, I call and speak to the manager. She offers NO APOLOGY and WANTS THE DESTROYED PIZZA RETURNED! Listen.  If I wanted a free pizza out of this deal, I would have ordered something way better than a plain ol cheese pizza. 

I did receive a replacement pizza. I showed the uninterested delivery driver the tortured pizza he delivered earlier.  HE OFFERED NO APOLOGY...wait...HE DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK!  

This place has ok food, but horrendous customer service. 

I'll be ordering 100% from my usual pizza place from now"}
{"text":"This was my second takeout order from this establishment. The first time was better, pizza ok. bone in wings dried out. Obviously precooked and reheated. Tonight, I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Ordered another pizza, boneless wings, and red velvet cake which they were out of and subbed cheesecake. Everything arrived 1.5 hours after ordering, cold. No accoutrements for the wings, which were \"ok\"  not even boneless wings actually chicken nuggets. Do you really think no one knows the difference? if that is an award winning honey chipotle sauce...I'm surprised. The cheesecake was a sliver, maybe two mouthfuls which they charged me $5. When I called the Resturant they were not terribly sympathetic and said I would need to seek a refund for the cake thru Eat24 whom I placed the order thru. So I did. Once I heated up the pizza it was pretty good, despite the omission of red pepper flakes which I had requested. The wings..,eh. Not worth it. Will I order takeout from them again? Not on your life."}
{"text":"At first I didn't think Caliente's pizza was anything special, but after eating in the restaurant as well as ordering takeout several more times, the pizza here has definitely grown on me. I'm a fan of pizza every which way and when I want a thicker crust, I turn to Caliente. I particularly prefer ordering takeout, but the restaurant has so many beer options, making it an awesome place to meet friends, hang out, or watch a game."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first when I tried this place because of the 2.5 star review but I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered a small pizza, garden salad, and the beach fries all which were pretty tasty in my opinion and were all large portions.  This was also during lunch hour and was part of the \"pick 2 for $8.99\" special which is very reasonable!

I will be returning in the future and definitely would like to try other items on the menu along with their beer flights!"}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza twice, and both times we were very pleased.  This is the best pizza we've had in the 15+ years living in this area and we've tried a lot of them.  Hope it sticks around!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with a 45 minute wait, have been patiently waiting... However, at one hour and ten minutes we called and they said driver was sent out 3 minutes ago. Well we live about two minutes away and we're still waiting at 1 hour and 45 minutes. We called once again and they seemed inconvenienced by our concerns, as if it was their job to provide customer service. Keep providing lack luster service, you're doing great! Love the cold pizza and breadsticks."}
{"text":"Well, I guess the hype of seeing the beer list got to us as we dined this past weekend because we were NOT impressed at all.   

We were seated quickly and ordered a beer and water.  We had to ask 3 times to finally get the glass of water.    The service was ok.    Nothing spectacular.  She managed to ring in the wrong beer for me that happened to be  $1 more then what I ordered.  I'm not a fan of having a 8% abv glass of refreshing beer without water.  I want to remember my experience.   

We ordered the world famous pan Pizza as the menu quoted they won in Vegas this year.  It was flavorless.  All I could taste was the oil.   Now, don't get me wrong,  the crust was fresh, fluffy, and not the worst I've ever had, but the toppings (2 toppings) were so heavy the crust couldn't hold up.   There was too much sauce for my liking, but that's a personal preference.  

I'm very upset that I paid $4.95 for 4 nuggets of chicken for a kid's meal.  Way over priced for what you get.  

I don't think my husband and I will be back after this visit.   Just because the beer list is decent, we don't feel the food meets the yum factor.  I should have read reviews first.  

The last issue I have is for a family friendly place there was no diaper station in the ladies room."}
{"text":"Ok everything is great pizza and all the other food is perfect. But I can't drink beer. I can drink wine but your selection is bad. Why can't I byob in your resturant and pay the corkage."}
{"text":"Not good food. I've given it around 4 tries to see if they were just off. I've ordered delivery and dined in. Yikes! Pizza dough is thick, spongy, kind of sweet; just not good dough. Quality of toppings....SCARY. That Chicken Ranchero chicken....WTF is that....Seriously. It seems like it is machine processed cubes. It has a strange flavor....just an off flavor. Wing flavors are plentiful and not good at all. If you get wings just stick to the regular Franks style hot or you will wonder WTF is this. They do have quite a few beers on draft...many of them craft. They are expensive and not many a good IPA around....Usually some double or imperial. My partner ordered a tulip of some imperial and it was around $10.00 for 8 ounces or so. So food just plain sucks.

Service is pretty darn lackadaisical. Kind of like....we don't really care that you are here and we'll let you sit there for a long time to prove it even if we aren't busy. Delivery drivers are on autopilot, barely speak, have almost no communication skills. Holy my god the bathrooms are really, really bad. Hold your breath and don't touch anything bad. And it sucks to have to say this but be fare warned....a couple of the dudes that work there are unkempt. Like homeless looking unkempt. Come on dudes. Its the service industry. You can still have a beard and long hair, but keep yourself clean for your shifts: take showers and don't look gross and greasy. Yikes. There is one cool guy. Nice, clean, provides good service and speaks like he actually cares. He usually works downstairs so if you go there go down and try to get him.

Definitely not anywhere near the best anything. Not even close at all."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a little better than the two and a half star rating it has. 

I came here for pizza and some beers and had a good experience. They have a really good beer list with a variety of out-of-the-way craft beers that I have never heard of, but that were really excellent. I had a couple of different beers that I really enjoyed. Prices, though, are a little on the high side but probably justified by the quality. 

I also had a small pizza with hot Italian sausage topping. The pizza was $8.99 plus $1.79 for the topping. The crust was on the soft side and sauce and cheese on the pizza were fine. I would have this pizza again. 

They have a very pleasant bar in the back with around 12 or so bar stools. It was nice and comfortable to sit there and service was good at the bar. I'd visit again, especially for their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for the first time. A large plain pizza and fresh cut fries.  Fries were really good, not too greasy, not soggy at all, great taste. The pizza was not so good. Had a funny taste. The crust was ok, sauce not so good. It wasn't bad but wasn't worth getting again."}
{"text":"I went to both Caliente's (the one in Bloomfield and the one in Castle Shannon) within about a month of one another and after that experience I feel compelled to write about the subpar food at both places.

So here is  the deal. The pizza is NOT the Best Pizza in the World. And honestly, they are probably going to get more negative reviews for labeling themselves that so ridiculously when they might have gotten away with their crappy food otherwise.

The pizza was terrible. It was doughy and gross, I could barely eat it and I'm a big pizza fan. However, I felt like I'd paid for the damn thing so I shouldn't waste it. It was also kind of generic, and the best part of it was probably the toppings. I might have been happier if I'd just eaten the cheese and toppings off of it.

I also ordered wings, and THOSE were bad as well. I don't know how you can make wings terrible, but they did, and that solidified it for me. Never going back here. And you shouldn't either. I get better pizza and wings from the Vocelli franchise."}
{"text":"I called this location and left my information 3 times to book a private party. On Monday I was told that the manager wasn't in and he would call me back Tuesday or Wednesday. I received no call. On Thursday I called and again the manager wasn't in yet again and I was told he would call me back. No call. On Friday I left my information again and reminded them that I had already called two other times and I was told that he would call me either that night or the next day. No call. I'm taking my private party elsewhere since this manager doesn't seem to have any interest in hosting and making money from our event. It unfortunate for them because we really enjoyed the food and space they had to offer, but if they can't return a simple phone call then I have little hope that they can coordinate and  host an event."}
{"text":"First time here. Came with a couple co-workers during lunch. I got the pick 2 lunch special. 1/2 steak hoagie and buffalo fries. Both were very good!  Also had one of their beers on tap. They have a nice beer selection too. It is small, but has very nice local friendly bar environment. Definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"This is my first bad review ever.  I have eaten in and ordered out from caliente in mMount Lebanon several times. Unfortunately I've never had a great experience and I've had several poor experiences.  Some of those bad experiences include forgotten pizzas and a buffalo chicken salad that was inedible  due to an atomic level buffalo sauce. Tonight I ordered for delivery a chef  salad and a large pizza. However the salad I got was a wilted garden salad with three tomato slices, three small cucumbers into red onion slices - no cheese, no meat.  I was only charged for a chef salad, however it wasn't even worth the $6.50 I paid.  I feel that they should be embarrassed that This came out of their kitchen.  I didn't bother to call to complain because I previously learned the hard way that it's a waste of time with them. Sadly, it's time to give up on Caliente. I gave them 2 stars because the kids said the piZa was fine."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the new place. Took the wife and kids. Service was good. Stuck to the pizza and wings based on other yelp reviews, The pizza was very good, had a cheese and a chicken Ranchero, the boneless wings seemed like frozen chicken nuggets but the bone in wings were meaty and delicious. The beer selection was fantastic. If only the average food equaled the above average beer selection, and above average pricing. This place would be a great regular stop."}
{"text":"Great call in a random town where everything around was closing early!

The order took about 40 minutes to arrive, but it was on a Saturday night. So that's expected. 
Food was fantastic! The pizza was hot and is different from other joints. I could have done without the breadsticks though, as they were pretty common. 

Order the pizza! I got the XL Meat Lovers, and again.... Fantastic! Price was $17.99 for the pizza and worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Really good beer list, many beers you wont find elsewhere.  Service is good.  Extra space downstairs."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous after seeing some terrible reviews.  I really had a totally different experience.  I didn't go there expecting some gourmet food so I was pleasantly surprised when the food was better than expected!
I got the Chicken Ranchero pizza and it was delicious.  We also got the pepperoni cheesy sticks.  They weren't the best I've ever had but if you're in the mood for carbs they really hit the spot.  There are plenty of delicious local and craft beer options.
Go on a Tuesday for trivia night!"}
{"text":"Just had a Steak Sub and it was the worst I've had from a pizza place.  The steak was so salty, it was almost inedible. The bread was stale. 
Other comments, it looks like if eat on, you get served on picnic ware and there are too many children working.  

Had an experience to dine in with a group by their choice.  We had a group of 10 and called ahead and was told by the gentleman to come on it no issue. We got there and was greeted by the blonde server and when told the party of 10 arrived she was very rude slamming tables together. Part of the party was not there and after 5 minutes grabbed the menus sitting in the unoccupied seats. Not happy about the utensils sitting out in plastic cups that have been sitting out for who knows how long and who touched it.  You can not get an in marinaded chicken breast, so no healthy choices.  The pizza I had was good flavor. As far as the menu, it is very limited for a sit down restaurant. For the wing flavors, there are no description so there is no way to make an educated choice."}
{"text":"The pizza's okay. It's nothing to rant or rave about, one way or the other. The staff are similar. They're not super welcoming, courteous, or helpful, but they're also not rude or nasty. Their website lists \"Every day specials\", but apparently these only apply to dine-in orders. You wouldn't know this, however, until you go to check out. I called, placed the order for pick up of a three-topping XL pizza. The woman who took my order told me the total, after tax, would be $13.90. When I went to pick it up, the cashier advised my total was $21.57. I advised her that I had been given the $13.90 price by the woman when I placed the order. She shrugged it off as, \"That's the dine-in price.\" I can definitely understand this. What I can't understand, however, is that I placed the order on the premise of its price, otherwise I would've gone to Fiori's. 
I won't be returning. 

Edit: changed from two stars to one star, because the pizza was cold, and there's a hard piece of something in it. Looks like I'm having Fiori's tonight, after all!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place because we live right up the street.  Unfortunately, we were not fans.  We ordered the four cheese pizza, breadsticks and a garden salad to share between the four of us (two little kids & two adults).  The service was good but they did not offer us a high chair and we have a 1 year old.  The 4 cheese pizza was actually lacking in cheese(??) and the pizza was a bit sweet for our tastes.  The bread sticks were very good though.  The garden salad greens were fresh but the Italian dressing was just odd tasting.  It didn't taste like Italian at all.  The beer selection was good.  And this is just a personal preference, but when eating at a sit down restaurant, we prefer to have glass plates and silverware instead of the plastic they use.  

Again, we really wanted to like the place but it was a let down."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to be from Pittsburgh when  this is the pizza place that has won awards at a national competition. Actually hilarious. horrible, tough crust. Undercooked pepperoni... Bland, dry cheese. Sauce that tastes like that sweet thick jar sauce from childhood. WHY IS THIS SO HARD????? Make fresh dough twice a day, stretch it thin, crush some San Matzano tomatoes and add some salt and olive oil, cover with some full fat mozz and then bake at an intense oven. Thanks. I'll be back when you try that. Until then, I will stay away. And so should everyone else. Thinking twice? You'll see..."}
{"text":"Bad hostess, but Great pizza and wings!  Beer selection is awesome and the specials are decent, $5 for a 22oz craft beer on a Friday is a deal. Waitresses are generally good, some amazing.  WORST and I mean worst hostess ever.  This is a solid 4 star establishment, but the hostess ruins it because she forgets you are waiting and seats others in front of you, has even crossed my name off the list without seating us.  And appears to be causing much confusion among the wait staff.  I'm torn, should I knock more stars off for a bad hostess?  maybe, but everything else is so good, so three stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Caliente in Bloomfield, and have had OKAY experiences. Our friends live in Mt. Lebo, and it's craft beer week, so we wanted to try the Caliente on Castle Shannon. Our experience here pretty much sucked from beginning to end. 

The Good: Buffalo Chicken Rolls were pretty tasty and were 1/2 off. We ordered 2 small pizzas for the table (Pepperoni with 1/2 onion and 1/2 jalapenos, and their gourmet Spinach and Feta). Both pizzas were very good.

The Bad: Our waitress knew nothing about the Craft Beer week special, knew nothing about any of the beers on tap, rarely came to our table to ask how we were doing, and we had to shout at her every time that we wanted a bottle opened. At one point, it took her so long that I decided to ask the bartender to open our beers (to which we were denied because she didn't know if we were 21, or where we were sitting. FYI, we were sitting at the table right in front of her.) She requested that we ask our server to to open them for us, and I replied back good luck finding her! The service at any restaurant is SO important, and Caliente failed to deliver quality service. For a place that claims to be a beer emporium, I'd recommend hiring folks that actually have an idea.

Verdict: Call for takeout if you want their food."}
{"text":"Hands down the most despicable service I've had in my entire life. I don't think a single employee smiled once the entire time we were in there. The bartenders are on their cell phones with their backs to the customers, and act like you're an annoyance to them if you want to order a drink. Nothing on the menu is worth the horrible service going on here."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza John the chef cooks one heck of a pizza highly recommend.. Josh was an amazing server very accommodating always checking on us.. def will be back with friem)nds and I'm telling everyone to go!"}
{"text":"Listen, this place had its beer menu expertly curated and down to a beautiful science. On top of that all of the drafts are half off for happy hour. The beer alone accounts for the quality of this place...unfortunately, there are many things that detract from it. The seriously largest strike I have against them is that they use plastic plates and utensils!! This is 2017!! I can't image how much waste this place is putting out on daily basis. Unless, of course, they are washing each plastic plate and recycling them (didn't see a recycling bin out back). It's a really darn shame. I would have politely discussed this and the reason behind it with the server, but while she was back and forth a few times, she didn't stay long enough for me to get a word in. 

Also, the server didn't seem to be aware of the special beer releases happening. Other than that, there was no paper towel dispenser and no door on the men's stall. I seriously felt like I was in some college bar in the South Side. 

So, I will go there for beer only until they change that outdated behavior of consumption and get the rest of their act together. The Bloomfield location is ten times better."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  I ordered a buffalo chicken hoagie on my most recent trip here and it was incredible.  Fresh and well prepared.  I have also previously had the pizza, which was some of the best in the city."}
{"text":"The delivery was an hr late. They said it would be 45 minutes and it took 1hr 45min and we only live 3 blocks away. We only got pizza and it was bad. I would not order pizza here but might consider eating in since it is so close."}
{"text":"Our pizza was over a hour late and it was cold. This isn't the first time. When you call they do not care to hear about it. There are better places that do care and hire enough drivers."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings.  However, the atmosphere here sucks.  It is so loud.  There's no acoustic tile on the ceiling and the floors are wooden and we couldn't here anyone talk within our party.  I would stop amd pick up a pizza but would never ever go here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered here both pickup and take out...pizza has been ok...good sauce. But just had 'my never ordering again moment'. After a long day of work, on a Friday, I understood the wait time could be long...one hour estimate on my pizza (just a cheese pizza...nothing fancy)...one hour and forty minutes later i decide to call to find out what the hell happened...person answering phone claims \"manager accidentally pulled ticket, so driver didn't know where to go and they were re-making order\"...how the hell do i reply to that??? Cancelled my order...I'll drive to Fiori's, lesson learned."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to frequent their far superior and more consistent sister location in Bloomfield. While the castle Shannon location is notably less grimy, the food isn't as good. The pizza is still solid don't get me wrong but my husband's beloved Buffalo chicken hoagie is entirely different than the version served at the original locale.

After an additional visit, this place is dangerously teetering on one star.  While the food is decent for bar fare, the service is terrible. Slow, bordering on incompetent which is mind boggling given there seem to be a dozen waitresses standing around at any given moment."}
{"text":"So I happen to pass this place a week ago and yesterday decided to stop there for dinner.

Much bigger inside then what I thought with a few pieces of decor that popped out to me. 

We sat in the dinning area down stairs which had a bar. Also there was a bar upstairs that we didn't go see so I need to explore that next time 

Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable. They had a nice little beer selection with local brewery's included! They will let you sample the beers which they put in little shot glasses for you. We tried 3 of them and went with a Stone Mocha IPA which was a new experience for me. Mix of stout with IPA which was surprisingly good! 

For dinner we went with basic bar \"type\" food. Ordered the fried zucchini and 5 cheese large gourmet pizza . The zucchini was cooked perfectly for me. Thin sliced with a nice thin layer of breading and came out nice and hot. 
As for the pizza I was impressed the crust was very lovely. Crust had a nice exterior with a little crunch and just the right amount of chew to the dough. The cheeses complimented the crust well. 

Have to say for my first time here I was surprised how good everything was. Hope to get the chance to try some other things on their menu"}
{"text":"Bad experience, we were told we couldn't eat there because my 6yr old in food therapy had chicken nuggets with him from 1 of the few food he eats with us because they sell boneless buffalo wings that he won't eat because of the breading texture.  We have ate there I've 8 times and I usually just bring a nutella sandwich, yogurt and cereal for him which has always been fine. Today we were out so we grabbed him nuggets. Thanks for making my kid feel even more bad of about his food issues!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some pizza and beer here with a friend on what we thought was a random Thursday. It reality, it was the  last game of the Eastern Conference Finals and we were the only ones not there to watch the Pens win it. Oh well! It did make for some entertaining conversation buttons when we were overwhelmed with sudden cheering or yelling.

Even with the frenzy, our server was friendly and attentive. They have a good beer selection and she recommended some definite winners to us. My friend and I split the Hawaiian pizza (praise anyone who will eat pineapple pizza with me)

I think the place has new owners...not sure what it used to be. It seems to be working for them, though!

It's right down the street from my apartment, so I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Ok, heard great things and just dined here and I _do  not_ get it. The wings were average, the pizza was doughy and the sauce was kind of weak. Plastic utensils and disposable plates - for a sit-down table service place not at all what I expected."}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza, a steak hoagie and cheese fries for delivery. Was told one price on the phone, but when the driver got here she had 3 different receipts and all had different prices in them. They added charges to my card without my authorization.
To top it off I got someone else's pizza. Called and told them I was given the wrong pizza. I don't want a new one or this one, I'll pay for the steak and cheese fries. The manager said ok it'll now be only $17 but nothing has been put back in my account."}
{"text":"For locals, this is just like the Pub and Pizza of old, except with craft beer.  It's an OK place to take the kids and enjoy a beer and get a bite.  Ordered a burger and wings. Burger was standard food service 1/2 pounder. Bun was a slightly stale whole wheatish affair.  Bourbon Maple wings came late and were drenched in syrup and bacon bits. Fries were just OK as they'd been sitting for a while.  I guess they fired the dishwasher as all plates and cutlery are plastic."}
{"text":"I am very torn on this spot. I eat here two times a week but it can be frustrating experience. I do feel that their low score is not accurate. Some thoughts:

1. You should only order online. Whenever I call,I sit on hold on for an average of 10 minutes listening to their awful hold sales pitch commentary that plays in a loop. 

2. They do forget the small details. Twice now I left to discover no salad dressing for the salad. Another time the wrong toppings for the burger I always check now before I leave. I was also sent home with the wrong food and asked to bring it back (which they then said keep when I refused to drive back due to their error). 

3.  I learned they had a loyalty program but none of the staff knew anything about it. I was told to email, which I did, and it's been over a month with no reply. 

4. The food is fine. No complaints. Most important. Hence the four stars

5.  Staff is always pleasant. They never remember me but always nice. 

Bottom line-very busy with  good food but short on staff"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! We keep trying to get the Quack Attack, but it is always sold out!! Excellent beer choices!! Very friendly waitstaff:-)"}
{"text":"I tried them for the first time tonight. I called in an order for pick-up. I ordered a small pepperoni pizza & 6 boneless hot wings. The pizza was pretty good, although the dough lacked flavor. 

I received 6 bone-in wings, instead of boneless. I chose the hot BBQ sauce with blue cheese on the side. The BBQ sauce tasted like a cheap commercial high fructose corn syrup sauce with red pepper flakes. Wasn't that hot. The blue cheese was put in the pizza box for some reason & not with the wings. In addition, the blue cheese was runny. For the life of me I've never had runny blue cheese. It was gross.

The overall establishment inside looked nicer than the previous owners. There were a lot more staff members working, who were all very friendly. It was fairly busy too. I agree with another reviewer by saying that Mt. Lebanon needs a place like this. Most restaurants in Mt. Lebo are priced high. This place has reasonable pricing. The Saloon is awful. The food sucks, the workers are unpleasant & the clientele isn't much better. I believe there are high hopes for this place from the community.

I might try this place again at some point. The problem is that there are so many good places for wings & pizza that are amazing. If I try them again & have similar results I'm probably out for good."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now since the Mt. Lebanon location has opened and we have really enjoyed each time. The beer selection is great, and they change the options pretty frequently which is nice so you have a bit of variety. We have had regular pepperoni pizza and recently tried the chicken ranchero, which were both really good. The wings have been a good size and have a good flavor, however the old bay seasoning option they have is super salty so I would not recommend. Overall, Caliente is a new and great option for a great bite to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"Just had Caliente for the first time and got our order to go. It was DELICIOUS. I had the grilled chicken salad and my husband had the Buffalo chicken hoagie. It was the best Buffalo Chicken Hoagie I ever tasted. When we picked up our order the atmosphere inside looked awesome. We will be back to try the pizza that looked delicious!

Also, they are in the entertainment book if you have it. This is why we gave it a try. We got both our meals for a total of 9 dollars! Now they have 2 new customers :)

UPDATE: still loved my first experience. I had to go down a star because I just had the pizza. Not a fan. Too much sauce and it is a sweet sauce. I would have never ordered if I knew this."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I gave this place a five star rating, but things done changed. I cannot express how disappointed I am that what should be a great place is simply not. I could rage on, but I'll leave it at horrible service and mediocre food. On the upside it's a great location. I'm going to take a break from this establishment until they get things sorted. The juke box is good."}
{"text":"Lots of food and draft beer options in a bar setting. Specials daily. Newer place in a prior restaurant at the same location. There are other locations in this franchise. Server was very friendly and our food came out quickly. Not too busy on a Wednesday night. The menu is huge win lots of apps, sides, wings, pizza, calzones, etc. pizza was good and flavorful and would definitely get again. Thick crispy crust. They do deliver. The red sauce in the pizza seemed a little sweet. The grilled chicken pizza was good but spicy for those who don't like anything hot. My only complaint is I asked for ranch with my pizza and they charge 75cents extra. I hate when places do this! We just spend $50 on pizza, salad and beer, I don't think I should be charged and extra 75cents for 2 tbsp of ranch! Regardless, I'll be back to try more tasty pizza!"}
{"text":"Driver delivered food to the wrong place and didnt realize until arrival, said he was going to go back and get the food off of them instead of getting new food, took 1.5 hours until food arrived"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent, if a bit pricey for what it was. The service left a bit to be desired, with two members of our group not getting their food for over a half hour, during which time everyone else was served. Salads are apparently hard to make...

Also, when they advertise that a featured beer is on special, and they list a beer as featured, don't assume it's the one on special. Apparently, that's two different \"featured\" definitions."}
{"text":"I generally try places twice before I really write them off. I've now tried Caliente twice. It pains me that this place is within a minute's walk from my house yet I have zero desire to ever go back.

There is no service, the prices aren't great, and the pizza is mediocre. At least the beer is good.

My most recent experience includes waiting over five minutes before even seeing someone that works there. Once someone did show up, we were told we could sit wherever and someone would be out. Someone did show up later - it took a while though. That person was rarely seen.

About the pizza, it's pizza. It's not good pizza but it's not ... terrible. It's just mediocre. The sauce has little to no herbs or salt, the cheese is tasteless, and the toppings taste canned which is a real bummer given the outrageous price they charge you per topping.

If you want to get a beer, I guess it's okay. If someone serves you anyways. Just go to Hitchhiker or a bit further to uptown itself."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night and weren't sure what to expect. For starters, the smell outside was intoxicating. When we went in it was much busier than expected so we sat down at the bar. The bar staff was very friendly and attentive despite being extremely busy. 
My husband ordered a Boulevard beer which, he was SO excited about since we are from Kansas City! We then ordered the Angie fries and a medium pepperoni pizza. The fries were great but the pizza was downright amazing. The crust was light and airy and the sauce was very fresh with chunks of tomato. 
Their menu was pretty large so there is a lot more we are eager to try. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place has the recipes from Bloomfield, but nothing else. We called in a take out order, and asked if we could get a growler to go. Bartender dropped a menu stating growler prices were listed - but they were not. Then advised he needed help from his manager to find out what was available and the prices. After making a selection, they hand us a partially filled growler! Service was so bad at the bar, it took at least 15 mins to get the beer. To top it all off, after getting no direction on where to pay, some waitress makes a snide comment in front of me (not realizing I was with my husband) when he tried to pay at the wrong place. We LOVE the Bloomfield location and were really hoping to have that closer to home, but we will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"3 stars, only because every time I order pick up - whomever is cashing me out, no matter who it may be, is never friendly - the food is always cold. The dining in experience is a tad better. The waitresses are always friendly. The pizza is mediocre, the hoagies are always good, the salads are just plain awful - mostly just lettuce with one slice of tomato and cheese at the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings.  Plenty of beer options.  Friday night, so it was packed.  A little noisy.  Staff was friendly and working hard.  There is a take out counter in the back that was busy.  Had the hot wings that were crisp and hot, hotter than most other hot wings we have had, but not to hot.  The pizza was good.  The crust is a little thicker but light and crisp.  We enjoyed the sauce and toppings."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 17 minutes for delivery. I assume the food was in the car for the majority of that time as it was cold. Quality of ingredients seemed to be there, hard to tell when not fresh though."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good and they have a large selection of beers. They have a good happy hour and I love their sangria. The waitress I had tonight was fun, easy to joke around with and excellent waitress."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. I honestly just come back for the buffalo chicken cheesy bread! The atmosphere is just a nice neighborhood bar spot, nothing fancy. But there's a nice vibe and everyone usually seems friendly. There are many different drink selections. You could pick your own beer out by the front coolers or choose from the bar. I've noticed they have quite the weekly features and specials for drinks. I also tried their house garden salad, it was a nice portion size and the veggies were all clean and crisp. I enjoy it here, there's always a coupon in the enjoy book too!"}
{"text":"Delivery took two hours, our pizza arrived cold, and it was not the correct pizza. The pizza itself was ok, nothing special. The manager was appropriately apologetic and refunded our purchase. On the positive side, the cheese bread was very good, and the driver was polite and professional. Overall, I would give Caliente another shot, but they certainly didn't win a loyal customer tonight."}
{"text":"Good but needs work!
1. Too loud!  I hate screaming at my dinner partner or bar mate!
2. Fries- first time we were here they were crunchy and delicious, tonight soggy, undercooked and cold. 
3. Plastic utensils?
4. Pizza and calzones were excellent!
5. Did I say too loud? I can't hear myself think!"}
{"text":"EDIT: after giving another chance, we are dropping our review from 5, to 3, now 1. A member of our family became very ill after eating here. We discovered undercooked chicken in our orders. :( 
I felt off after eating here, but only had a salad and fries! 

You can search restaurants on the health department's website and it looks like they struggle with safe handling /storing of food.
This is not ok. I know the service here has been lacking lately, so why should safety be any different.

We used to visit /order from here 3-5 times a WEEK. We were very loyal and sent many customers your way. We saw a gradual fall in the rating of this restaurant and as it did, we started noticing orders that never show up, poorly prepared orders, confusing situations when our food arrived and just all around poor customer service. 

We will no longer recommend Caliente and will be finding a new regular place to support. 

I truly hope management kicks into gear here. This is no joking matter and someone could fall very I'll, or worse again."}
{"text":"I don't really understand why this place only gets 2.5 stars. I've been here a few times and have only had good experiences. One star loss because some of their bottles are a little pricey, and the beer cooler could definitely be cleaned (I found a moldy bottle) but other than that it's pretty good.

We have gotten wings, pizza, other various appetizers and beers here and they have all been good. I don't even really like wings, but their variety of sauces makes me want to try more and more of them.

If your looking for a classy restaurant, this is not it- but they also don't try to be. They are a bar, they serve their pizza and wings with paper plates and baskets. And you know what? That's fine with me. 

They have daily drink and food specials that you can find on their menus. We try to take advantage of those deals as much as possible."}
{"text":"I never thought I would ever write a Yelp review, but I feel like I have to after my experience tonight. I ordered online through the Eat 24 app and I received confirmation that the restaurant received my order and it was cooking. When I arrived to pick up my food, they said they never received my order. I understand things happen sometimes, but this is the third time in a year that my online order was not received by this restaurant. I use the Eat 24 app about 4 times a week and I have never had any issues at any other restaurants. 
On top of all of this, the manager or cook, I couldn't tell what she was, didn't offer me anything for my trouble other than just making the pizza. She didn't even offer to comp it. The takeout order I placed was already estimated to be a 40 minutes wait. I don't have another 40 minutes to wait for them to make my pizza. 
I feel really bad writing this review, but if you can't handle online ordering, don't offer it."}
{"text":"So here's the thing about Caliente on Castle Shannon Blvd: their food is good (when they actually give you what you order) but their service/management just sucks. 

I've eaten there multiple times and ordered take out a couple of times and I've never had a good experience from beginning to end. When you order a beer, you find out they don't have it but no worries, they'll bring by another one in a half hour. Did you get take out? Well, you get to wait 25 minutes while they apologize about their \"new system,\" which apparently is just continuously new and unconquerable since they've been open for weeks and it's always \"new\". 

One thing they won't get right is your order. I've been given the wrong thing 2 times and then questioned by the staff like I'm a moron for actually knowing what I ordered. Funnily enough, I didn't actually order two slices of someone's left over pizza. Take a look at the attached pic of their loaded fries. The menu says \"Loaded Fries your choice of French or Buffalo Fries loaded with Mozzarella, Provolone & Bacon\" but what you actually get are soggy fries with nacho cheese and some bacon. 

But their pizza is good. So are their wings. But stick to that when ordering. It doesn't seem like they are on their game with other menu items. 

The problem is that there is a lot of competition around them in Mt Lebanon. They aren't the only quality pizza shop or brew pub  in a half mile radius. In fact, there are 3 pizza joints and 2 bars that arguably have better pizza and beers within a 5 minute walk. If their service and experience doesn't get better, the good news for me is that there are better options available elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was good. Love the pizza. Place could use a good cleaning. Especially the brass railing at the bar. This would not keep us from going back though. The employees standing outside smoking is not a good representation of the place. Its a huge turnoff!!"}
{"text":"Too bad Yelp doesn't give you a half star because I feel Caliente was actually a  2.5 - not bad, not great.  I ordered a Greek Salad. It was very good, generous and fresh. I was kind of disappointed in that the Greek dressing is in a packet of Marzetti's Greek Dressing that they give you. Still it was very tasty and I enjoyed it. The pizza was good but not \"the best in the world\" as they advertise. I would order it again though. I wish they offered a thin crust alternative. We had 2 small children with us and they gave each of them a ball of dough to play with while waiting for dinner. That is a cute idea and the kids were amused. My biggest complaint is the music was far too loud. It was hard to converse. We like kind of noisy places because of the kids but this was too loud. The service was very good. The waitress and staff were very friendly and attentive. All in all I will go back but I'm in no hurry to do so. As you can tell by my review I was very conflicted from start to finish."}
{"text":"This is a newer location but the pizza is just as good as the Bloomfield location. I love the sweet crust and sauce. It's one of the best pizza places in the area, it's a must try."}
{"text":"One star is too much. While their pizza is good it is not worth the aggravation to get one. On more than 1 occasion I was advised it would be 30 min when over an hour later it has not shown up. On a good day you will not get your pizza in any timely manner at allOne time is forgivable and I decided to try again. Tonight I ordered a pizza at 6:30 with it being advised I would receive it by 7:01. At 7:30 I decided to call to see where my pizza was at to only be told it has not left the store. I asked to speak to a manager who told me they got way more busy than they anticipated. Which I have hear this excuse before. I then asked to speak to a manger and somehow between the 2 min of me speaking with the store to speaking with a manager it was on it way out for delivery. She then told me that she would give me a credit. I asked how I would receive that since the pizza already left and she said it would be in the computer. That is no help to me now that I wasted money buying from a place I will never order from again. They really need to either up their staff or do something but I know I won't be around d to find out since I will never order from there again."}
