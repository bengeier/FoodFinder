{"text":"Hands down sesame chicken is the best   Only bad thing I can say is the decor could use an update."}
{"text":"Really small selection for the buffet.I couldn't have hoped for better service. Everybody was sweet as could be t9 my toddler.the egg rolls were awesome.I just wish they gad nore to choose from."}
{"text":"Every time I come to a Hakka restaurant, I always order the chili chicken. The chicken here was okay at best. The sauce was alright, but the chicken wasn't really that tender. However, my coworker told me to try their chili fish the next time and I'm glad I did. It had a generous amount of fish, and tasted quite good, much better than the chicken imo.   The decor is pretty old, but oh well."}
{"text":"China Garden is the hideous lovechild of American-style Chinese food (which, overseas is actually regarded as a separate cuisine altogether) and Hakka-style (as mentioned by Andreas D.) Chinese food.  It's greasy, salty, and saucy. Not to mention, five dollars!"}
{"text":"Best hakka food, period. I've been coming here for over a decade and never been disappointed. The manchurian chicken,  sweet and sour chicken and chilli chicken dishes are outstanding. If you want soup, you must have the egg corn soup."}
{"text":"Basically you're coming here for the Chili Chicken and you're getting take out and eating elsewhere.  Decor is not pretty. But I assure you they have the best Chili Chicken ever. I will drive 20 min just to get it.  Seriously - Chili Chicken with extra gravy. Only giving 4 stars because I wish they would pretty up the place a bit, be a little more customer service oriented, and take debit (cash and credit only)."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! The help was using a dirty rag to clean around the trays and was touching the food with the dirty rag. Feel sick now. Gross!"}
{"text":"About the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Food is so bland or super sweet and the hostess had such a bad attitude. If you order stuff make sure you know what it looks like before you get it. If you order takeout, they don't give utensils."}
{"text":"This place was alright, a friend and I couldn't decide what to eat and she picked this, so I went along with it. I ordered veggie chow mein, and my noodles were crispy. It tasted pretty fresh to me and it was piping hot.   Service is left to be desired, this place is packed at lunch time, and we were placed at the end of the  restaurant where there is a cash register, and lots of hustle and bustle. The  waiter also served me and my friends food at different times, that were far apart.  Overall I was satisfied with this as a cheap non authentic Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"BEWARE VEGETARIANS & VEGANS Have been going here for that past 18 years but lately it seems they are not the same. Ordered food for my birthday today and got a piece of bone in my food. Sadly, realized it when it was in my mouth between my teeth. The feeling is still there and honestly it hurts to see that my beliefs were exploited. Being a pure vegetarian it ruined everything/my day for me and I left the food in between. My confidence is shattered and I am never ordering again. Vegetarians and Vegans make sure you scan the food before you eat, one spoon at a time.... Don't Trust this place to take care of your needs."}
{"text":"Ordered deliver and it was over an hour and a half.  The food was not great after all that..."}
{"text":"This was my go to Chinese Hakka place, especially for chilli chicken until I discovered Asian wok and roll. Although this restaurant has amazing dishes, I started to notice the chicken in the chilli chicken had more crispy and crunchier pieces and some didn't even seem like proper chicken pieces. What a rip off and the fried rice had a burnt taste to it. The atmosphere in this restaurant is really old school."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.  The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.  Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.  The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food."}
{"text":"I have been a couple of times to China Garden for lunch on a recommendation from a co-worker.  They have great lunch specials at $6.99 and $7.99 which include a pop or soup.  The portions are huge, so come hungry!  They are known for their chili chicken or manchurian chicken.  It has got a bit of kick.  Service is quick, you will get your meal within 5 minutes of ordering.  Lunch time gets busy, so get there early.  They only take cash or credit card, no debit.  It is a good lunch spot in the Airport Road area if you looking for chinese/hakka style cuisine."}
{"text":"Me and two other friends were in the Airport Road area last night and decided to visit China Garden to grab some dinner. We went in for about 7pm and the place was a lot emptier than I have ever seen it. Usually it is a lot more packed at lunch time.  At first glance the decor in this place is scarce if present at all, and you'll certainly be wondering if this place has passed their past health inspections as the restaurant is a little worn down (floors, chairs, tables, etc). It seems pretty obvious that the people that dine here are not here for the ambiance, they are here for the food.   We ordered the Manchurian Chow Mein Noodles, Vegetable Pakora, Chilli Paneer and Chilli Chicken. All three dishes came with rice in individual bowls that we didn't have to order on the side or were charged extra for. I appreciate that, as many places don't have the courtesy of doing this. The dishes came in very generous portions so ordering one plate of a dish between four people is generally enough.   The service here was pretty good as well, the servers take note of you as soon as you walk in and are ready to take your order momentarily. Our food came to our table in under 10 minutes and was piping hot!  The only reason they do not get  a full five stars is because of the state of their washrooms. As soon as I stepped foot in there I decided that maybe I could wait until I got home. The place look unsanitary, which was really frustrating.   If you are in the airport road area, go in for some hot and spicy Hakka food! Just try to steer clear of the washrooms!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this business closed almost 2 years ago! I liked how convenient it was hope some cheap Chinese or Asian will open around bloor and avenue or bloor and Bay Area."}
{"text":"Great Hakka food, had the vegetable Manchurian pakora and chili chicken with steamed rice and vegetable spring rolls. Excellent food, served hot and fast. However due to busy dinner time, I think the staff was rushed and tables were not wiped down enough."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indo Chinese I've had in North America. Went for lunch special and got some huge portions for just $9 per entree! The only critique I had is that the rice was a little dry and since the food came out so fast, I'm not sure how fresh the food was. Nevertheless it was DELICIOUS and I definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Hakka joint in the GTA. Over the years, I have tried them all (Chilli Chicken House, Fredrick's, Royal Jasmine just to name a few) and I keep coming back here. If you've never been, stop what you're doing and plan a visit. The restaurant is always very busy. There are literally hundreds of take out orders happening simultaneously with dine-in guests, but service is always fast. The menu is quite large. For anyone who is new to this type of food, Hakka cuisine is an Indian adaptation of Chinese food which made it's way to India many, many years ago. It can be quite spicy, depending on the dish. Some of the Hakka favorite staples are Chilli Chicken (dry or with gravy), Manchurain Shirmp, Fried Rice and Sweet Corn Soup. If you are going to do a take out order, be warned that Hakka food doesn't taste as great as it cools, and it does not always re-heat well. Dine-in if it's your first time for the best experience; and if you're a Hakka pro (like me), just call ahead with your order, and race home with your hot, white plastic bag of belly-bursting deliciousness."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant!  I agree with others comments about the decor being a little less than desirable but I am not particular about that stuff!  Good food is enough for me!  If you decide to go, Shrimp Pakoras are a must have, but make sure you cut it in half first and let some steam out or you will suffer a burnt palate and the rest of your meal will suffer!  After the Shrimp Pakoras, Hakka Noodles and Manchurian anything (chicken, fish, etc.) are my recommendations!  Yummmmm!  They offer 10% off take out orders over $10, I believe."}
{"text":"Uhhh... only come here if you're desperate for Chinese food, otherwise, I would say, \"Skip it!\"  It's a dingy, but welcoming enough place with very cheap meals.  My colleagues and I know this as the 'cheap Chinese place'.    I had the lunch special, BBQ pork with bean curd on rice which came with a pop for $4.95 plus tax.  For $1 more, you could add some greens.  The meal looked a bit like leftovers and was merely edible.  Others in the party had the lemon chicken combo which came with wonton soup, a spring roll and rice.  The lemon chicken was a good size - 2 chicken breast halves breaded and freshly deep-fried with the sauce on the side.  Crispy and delicious so I'm told.  Overall, this is truly an epitome of the 'Meh' experience."}
{"text":"Omg! Indo-Chinese in Toronto! Food is incredible and very reminiscent of the real deal in India. Service was great as well. A great experience overall! It's a bit divey and it's perfect!"}
{"text":"One of the Chinese restaurant go-tos for our family when we want a quick weekend dinner.  Our usual orders usually consist of Cantonese chow mein, house special fried rice, General Tao chicken, fish with mixed vegetable, beef with mixed vegetables and shrimp with lobster sauce.  Portions are always HUGE, always leftovers!  Typical Chinese food fare so tasty if you enjoy your Chinese.  Of course my same usual complaint...true of all Chinese restaurants...are the excess salt/MSG that has me feeling bloated afterwards and binging on water for days...and the fact that the entire menu is all fried, nothing grilled, oy!  Still, they are good at what they do and you won't be disappointed with the value you get."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since the 80's. Plain and simple.....if you are looking for fine Chinese dining, go somewhere else. If you want consistently good/average Chinese buffet food, this is your place.   I usually go there for dinner and have never been for lunch. I rarely eat there, rather get a to-go order and eat it at home. It lasts me 2 days. That's how much they give you in a to go order! You can let them put a little of everything or pick and choose what you want. I would say that 85% of the items in the buffet have been the same variety since the very first time I went there. If it works and makes money, why change it?!   The people are always extremely friendly. The dining room is divey, sometimes a little messy, and they have a table in the corner for owners/employees that's always got a TV and other stuff cluttering it. Like I said I usually take it to-go. A window could really help this place out but its not exactly the best area so I get it.  The price is good. Its $8.00 for a dinner buffet weather you eat there or get it to go. Funny side note, the Styrofoam trays that they use for to-go orders say \"Gracias\" on them. LOL! The do charge a $.50 fee to use your card there too.  Again, fine dining it is not but for the people who like this type of food it is the best! Every time I mention getting Chinese food for dinner, this is the first place that comes to mind. The people who go here a lot, will fully understand my review!"}
{"text":"Tried China Palace for the first time with a group of friends. The food never disappoints you. We got the Bombay Chicken, Mandarin Chicken, as well as Hakka Noodles. It was the first time trying these dishes. I can't compare this to Mandarins but it is really close."}
{"text":"It amazes me that there are some restaurants that not only have survived decades and generations of ownership but have also retained that look, feel and taste of that same old restaurant over those same number of years. China Garden is very much this type of place. Somewhere around 60 years old, this chinese sit-down restaurant still looks like it could be part of the set on a 1950's film. It's got a very old-school front signage that points the place out clearly on the street. It sits back a ways down the main avenue where there are now quite a few restaurants popping up. But like I said, it has still survived all of the new downtown redevelopment. Why? Well try the food!  They offer pretty much the standard fare of western chinese restaurants. The menu has got a nice selection of soups, fried rolls, fried meats, noodle dishes, etc. I prefer the won ton soup. It has a very nice and delicate broth (but flavorful) along with a melt in your mouth noodle. The fried goodies are great, my faves are the eggrolls (not too bready and full of flavor). Pineapple chicken is also usually tasty but sometimes lacks flavor.  Service isn't real snappy as they typically operate with one hostess who doubles as waitstaff but she does the job nicely and with a smile. I have come to know that food this good deserves patience. The interior is very much a throwback to the 50's so don't be shocked when you realize this might be the oldest place open in St. Jean. But it's clean and charming. It also gets a nice view of the river.  Parking has been greatly improved since the redevelopment. There is now a full free lot next to the restaurant and a couple of small free lots just down the road a block or two. Sidewalks in St. Jean have all be refurbished so a stroll to and from dinner along the river is a real treat.  I usually hit this place around lunchtime and it's never got more than 4-5 different tables filled. It may likely get busy at night. I love the food so much that I've even crossed the border and back just for take out! So worth the trip."}
{"text":"If you enjoy spicy Asian food, this is the place. It's great! I'm always amused at the long lines that form here during lunch hours. Don't let the interior decor of the place fool you; it's the food and prices that will have you coming back for more.   Service is prompt. Their system works. Order at the front, pay, wait (about 10-15 minutes), and then you'll have pipping hot Hakka food brought to your table to be enjoyed!  Tip: try the chili chicken and Hakka beef chow mein, it's far better than what's across the street on Airport Road (i.e. Asian Wok n' Roll among the other saturated Hakka places in the one-strip plaza that exist there). There are many other options on their  lunch menu; many of which I have yet to try.  Minus a star as they only take cash and credit only, and not debit."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a cheap, greasy dive, but what can I say? I love the food. A big part of this reason is because I've been coming here for over twenty years. I have lots of memories going here with my best friend and her family well before I hit the double digit age group, and even now so many years later it's exactly the same as I remember it. Nothing fancy, but consistent!"}
{"text":"Just to clear up any confusion, I am giving this place two stars based only upon the eggrolls and sauce served with them.  I was not impressed with the rest of the food at all.  I ordered a combo with my husband; it came with almond chicken, pineapple chicken, two eggrolls each, Asian ribs, and fried rice.  What we recieved, besides the admittedly delicious eggrolls, were:  veggies in broth w/approx 20 cashews on top, chewy/tough ribs, beyond salty rice (however, it was not greasy so that's certainly something), and balls of chicken, fried but chewy, in some bland sourish sauce.  We ate, and left hungry with a rather large order of eggrolls to-go, for when we got home.  All that aside, as I was eating, I was facing the bathrooms and could not help but notice an employee leave the bathroom area with a still dripping plunger, AND CARRY IT INTO THE KITCHEN!   Needless to say, we will not be going back, ever.  The saddest part is that my husband assures me that the restaurant was wonderful when his grandparents used to bring him when he was much younger."}
{"text":"Good Hakka Cuisine. Been coming here for long. Lunch menu is straight forward. Come in , order , wait. They are fast, food came within 5-10min. Ordered the chilli chicken with rice and hot & sour soup. Recommended. Good value."}
{"text":"I am going to give China Garden a 5 star solely based on the taste of the hakka food. It is located in the green Plaza and has a very fast-food feel and is a little gem that has been there for as long as I can remember. The restaurant is not luxurious and the bathrooms are also not the cleanest but the taste of the food speaks for itself. If you ever go here on weekends they have an endless number of pick up orders and a packed restaurant. They have a seating area for families and chairs for waiting as well. I have to say that my favourite order of veggie manchurian with gravy (extra spicy) is always consistently great. It is a big portion- about 13 dollars and comes with green chillies, hot sauce and soy sauce packets as well as a bowl of rice. I also do get the chop suey on occasion and it is also delicious. This is by far the best hakka food I have tasted anywhere."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge Chinese food fan but was looking for something different one night and came across China Garden. I loved it!!! They were so kind and helpful and let me take my time when ordering takeout. They even let me check out the buffet so I could see what the food looked like!!  I ended up with shrimp fries rice and sweet and sour chicken. It was delicious and the portions were huge, leaving me with plenty of leftovers!!!   They served my boyfriend and I hot tea while we waited for our food with no additional charge.  We've been back multiple times since then and the owner always knows what I want!! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good...the best thing about this place is the lunch buffet...you can't beat the price and amount is food you get"}
{"text":"best chill chicken, ever!!! its always busy when i go in, always! the food is absolutely fantastic and the prices are good. the service can be slow but its worth it. Well after visiting here last night (10-26-14) I took this restaurant from a 5 to 4 star. I ordered the chili chicken as usual and I was pretty disappointed. Full of fat. I did initially ask for white meat only but the guy said they no longer do that. I ate a bit of it and now its sitting in the fridge. I probably won't finish it. For $13, I expect meat, not fat. The sauce is amazing but these people really need to start using only meat. (12-8-15) ordered the chili chicken, again, along with the veggie Hakka noodles. He noodles were under cooked and the chili chicken isn't as spicy and flavorful as it use to be. Pretty disappointed. I use to love this restaurant and would always visit for chili chicken while I was in the area but I'm pretty sure last night easy last visit."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for consistency.  Like how the owner is always standing at the checkout counter, scouring the stock section of the newspaper...grumbling to himself. How the same lady server has worked there for all of the twenty or so years I've been going there.  And how the food never varies. The same dozen or so featured items week after week, year after year.   Sometimes you need that. The feeling that while the rest of the world is changing at breakneck speed, there's a respite from all of it.  A place where you know you can always go where the food, the people, the ambiance will always be the same. Its small intimate surroundings. The server, who upon seeing me knows to bring me a diet coke and does so before I seat myself.  And the warm smiles from the owners when I leave.  Be forewarned however. It's not fancy. Its very small, and can get crowded at lunch and dinner. But the food will always be the same, guaranteed.  This place is pure comfort."}
{"text":"This is a great little buffet. I have been coming here for years. The egg rolls are amazing.if you order lunch to go, you will eat for two or three days off of it."}
{"text":"So my coworker was really promoting this place to me, and I felt like Chinese food so our decision was made.......Horrible mistake!  Number One: Disgusting bland food. Every single (limited selection) dish sucked! The orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard. The onion rings were crap. The egg rolls, crap. The chow mein noodles which I thought were supposed to look brown, were these pale watery strans of crap. The rice, which was clearly not white rice, was bland. The desserts sucked as well. Also, the presentation of the food looked very sloppy.   Number Two: Horrible enviornment. Ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations. The booth seats were WAAAAYYY to close to the tables which made for an uncomfortable sitting experience. The sneeze guards were dirty. Weird smell. And stupid layout, with a couple of booths too close to the employee personal area and some too close to the (again small) buffet line.   Number Three: After this review, I am calling the health services on this disgustng place. A couple of times I noticed an employee scratching their nose, and then continuing with their work. Then I was forcing down my food when my coworker spots a moving insect on the wall next to us. It was a BABY COCKROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw this place. I will never ever go back here. And if this place isnt shut down, I hope nobody else does either.   On the plus side, its only $6.00. But still not worth it. If I could, I would give this place negetive 1000000000000000000000 stars."}
{"text":"My family and I were getting ready to head home and we decided to go to the China Garden Restaurant. We ordered the chicken corn soup, the chicken pakora, and the Manchurian beef. The soup was very good, as it is one of my favorites and something I always order whenever I go to a Chinese restaurant. The chicken pakora was very good as well. The manchurian beef lacked what we were hoping for and has forced me to give it a 3 Star. This was an okay experience and I might come back."}
{"text":"decent, cheap, take-out style chinese. tastes more americanized than most chinese food in toronto so i'd order from here when i was craving nyc style chinese (of course, it's not as good as chinese in nyc). it was also the only place open on xmas eve last year so it gets extra props for that."}
{"text":"I have been eating here with my family since the early 90's this place is the pinnacle of great service and food! Eating at this place should be on everyone's bucket list before they leave this world!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My family and I have been going here for years! The chicken pakora, shrimp fried rice, and the chilli chicken (gravy) is the best dishes on the menu! The takeout service is amazing! Dining in service is alright, but we usually do takeout and there have been no complaints so far!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and they have been there since 1980...WTF a business that is still around after 30 years... must be good."}
{"text":"Food was bland and expensive. Tons of real \"Hakka\" places in the GTA this isn't really one of them. Service was poor as well. Got one glass of water and that was it."}
{"text":"Just as an FYI, China Garden is a Hakka style restaurant. Meaning, the menu is different from what you might expect."}
{"text":"When you're in a hurry and looking for passable Hakka takeout, this is the place to come. While the service and venue (one of those places that makes you stop and read the health inspection sign) are both pretty much a 1/5, they whip up a semi-satisfactory main for vegetarians and omnivores alike. People actually *like* this place?  I've tried their Manchurian Vegetables on rice twice, and though the portions are huge, the rice was stale on 1 of the 2 visits.   The dish itself was decent, but seriously, how hard is it to keep the rice rotations fresh as a busy restaurant?  2/5. No Debit."}
{"text":"China Garden is one of those places that I crave.  I use to live not far from here as I was going through high school and a few years after.  I now live in the surprise area but about every two months or so I go out of my way to China Garden for the yummy sesame chicken and teriyaki wings.  There sweet and sour pork is also something to be desired.    China Garden does Chinese food the way it was done in the late eighties and early nineties.  It's what I grew up knowing and came to love.  The sweet and sour pork has the wonderful breading and is left to soak in the sweet and sour sauce.    Chinese food by today's standards leaves me feeling bloated and disappointed so I pass it up more and more.   The only regret when I eat china garden is that it will be a while before I get to go back.  The egg drop soup is also some of the best in the valley.  You have to go try it.  I have been going here since 1994 and still love it.    P.S. they do take out and the portions are HUGE for the price"}
{"text":"Hate to do this because I've been  coming here for years but he past 2 years years now the quality of the food has really gone down they're definitely not using the same chicken they were using 2 years ago for their chili chicken, the beef is chewy and dry but only for the past year, the fish stayed the same but the sauce is a lot sweeter than before, hopefully this review and the other bad ones I just read make the owners go back to their old meat supplier and until that happens me and the other 200 ppl in my family are never going back"}
{"text":"Great place  we are frequent visitors Fish manchurian dry with extra spice and chicken Hakka chow mein are our favourites.  Recently we ask for less oil as too much oil is used in dishes"}
{"text":"It's located in a sketchy area of town, food was okay, the buffet itself is small, maybe six items to choose from. Service was great but the distance from my abode would keep me from returning as the food isn't spectacular. It's more of a local neighborhood place & not a place you take family or coworkers for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Hakka craving? Don't go to a place that spells it \"Haka\" all over their menu. Yep, this is it. I ordered take out, and if you ask me, that's the only way to go about it. Sitting in for a meal would be depressing - this restaurant is small, and not the cleanest. Some of the other hakka restaurants around fair better as a dine-in option.   I am used to some of the best Hakka restaurants around Mississauga, so when it came to price and portions, and although the reviews are a rage, I wasn't impressed. China Garden is priced higher than the usual Hakka cuisine. And portions are comparable to any other Hakka restaurant; maybe even a tad less.   My order:   1. Manchurian Chicken (Mild, gravy) - I don't know what the hell this was but it definitely wasn't Manchurian. The Manchurian I am used to is a lot darker; this was a light brown mess. However, it didn't taste as bad as it looked.   2. Schezwan Chicken (Hot) - My Mom loved it. But then, she likes anything spicy. I didn't try it (don't eat spicy), but my Mom recommends this as the spicy lover's Hakka go-to.  3. Mixed Hakka Chow Mein - Noodles with pork, shrimps and chicken; this was delicious. Probably the best I've had in a while.   My chicken orders came with steamed white rice. The packaging for the chow mein and steamed rice was perfect. They gave me little containers of vingegar, soya and chilli sauce. The containers for the chicken were not as neat. The schezwan chicken spilled all over the plastic bag.   Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 8 years now. They used to the best chilli chicken in town at a great price. But like everything in life it has fallen from grace. They consistently lowered their quality. You order food a certain way and serve it what ever way they want. After you ask them to fix it they question it and give you dirty looks. Don't waste your time, and go across the street where they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"I've heard much about this place but the food was average. I got the veggie chowmein and the chilli paneer (cottage cheese) and even though both tasted just okay, they were very greasy and heavy. The portion sizes are really good for the price, so for those that crave this sort of Hakka food, this might be a good spot! I don't think I loved it as much to go back though.."}
{"text":"I have ordered chicken hakka noodles and chicken soup. Their customer service was unexpectedly bad, have no sense of greetings. Food which we got was not properly cooked and soup was cold. Well that was my last visit to the unhygenic plce...."}
{"text":"Decor is a bit bland but you come here for the food!  Ordered the Manchurian mixed Chow mein and Shrimp Pakora.  Both were huge portions and excellent flavour, heat and texture!  I saw many other people ordered what looked like the Chilli Chicken which is what I will try on my next visit.  You know a place isn't joking around when they have the hot peppers in vinegar + red chilli hot sauce for you to zip up your meal on the table!  Hakka food all the way!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for a while and as some of the responses had been good most of them weren't. I decided to try it it for myself and to be honest it wasn't that great.  I wouldn't say that I am a Hakka expert, but I have eaten a lot of it in my time. There was nothing special about this place as their food was below bar and the restaurant itself was kind of grungy. With so many better places around I would recommend that you go to Wok n Roll which is across the street."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family.   This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place.   Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good.   Go and try not to get hooked.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favourite Hakka place. The food is fantastic but man the restaurant is dirty. Chilli chicken is a must. Vegetable manchurian and chow mein is great. Definitely could use an upgrade inside and a professional cleaning staff. 4 stars for the awesome food. If the interior was nicer it would be 5 star"}
{"text":"Simply put, amazing! Small selection, but what they have is some of the best I have ever had. Sesame chicken has incredible flavor, great Lo mein, decent salad bar, tasty sweet n sour pork. This is a wonderful place worth seeking out. Yes the building is windowless and ugly outside, but inside is a little slice of Chinese heaven!"}
{"text":"Love this place been going here for 10 or so years it looks scary from the outside but give it a chance the owners remember everyone that is a repeat customer they remember if you want spicy mustard or not the food is great I have only ever had the buffet"}
{"text":"Aye... Best chinese food ever. You only get this kind of food in India and I am not even kidding."}
{"text":"Been on the search for Hakka in Toronto.  My first experience here was sometime in September 2016 and I really had no desire to try them again.  It just was not good.  Since then I've tried various Hakka places but none deserved a second visit.  This past Saturday my husband got to pick where we got dinner and chose to try China Garden again.  I'm so glad I was out of vetos!  The food was absolutely fantastic.  I've finally found my Hakka restaurant!  Recommendations: chili okra, chili chicken, Szechuan beef:"}
{"text":"We can't help but go to this hole in the wall in Malton.  Why am I in Malton you ask?  I was wondering that myself.  Ah, just can't get away from it?  But if you are in the neighbourhood and want some super greasy Hakka food then this is your choice.  It's cheap as heck and the oil, chillies, and MSG go down nice and easy."}
{"text":"China Garden has been a post airprot pick-up ritual with my family for the last 10 years. The food is just phenomenal and it's definitely the beat hakka chinese spot in the GTA. The only downside is their unattractive seating (avoid the washrooms) which is why I didn't give them a 5 star rating. If you're vegetarian and confused by the menu i've written my family's tried and loved menu;  -large sweet corn soup (easily shared by 4) -chilli paneer with gravy - veg manchurian with gravy (upgrade to a deluxe for more veg and less carby manchurian balls) - egg fried rice  It's heaven."}
{"text":"Hakka is not a part of my diet. It's just one of those things I crave from time to time, and the next day swear will never consume again. Regarding this restaurant: Cult Favourite. Family favourite. If you ask any Indian person about this restaurant. odds are, they will have some very good things to say about it. I've tried numerous Hakka food restaurants in and around Toronto, and have yet to meet one that is as good as China Garden. As others have mentioned, the most popular dishes here are Chili Chicken, and Manchurian Chicken. Vegetarians will not be disappointed either. The Veg Manchurian is really good.   The establishment itself is nothing to rave about; but who really cares if the food is this good? The quality of service fluctuates. At times, way off. Go for the food!"}
{"text":"Dans le genre cuisine chinoise fast-food, China Garden est sans aucun doute un des meilleurs endroits de Saint-Jean. Contrairement aux buffets, la nourriture est préparée lors de la commande. La clientèle est gériatrique mais Martine St-Clair en background radiophonique est tout simplement génial!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in like 10 years.  Got invited to go to lunch today and it was EXACTLY the same as it was the last time I was there.  Buffet was pretty good and the menu has not changed either.  Not much to look at but for a 6.00 lunch what do you expect."}
{"text":"This place is great for chili chicken!  The other dishes that we have tried are okay, standard hakka style dishes. The shining star truly is the chili chicken. We usually order the the chili chicken in two ways, 1. Chili chicken - with gravy, regular (in regards to spice). This is then served over rice/with a side of rice. It's pretty good if you enjoy gravy. 2. Chili chicken dry (meaning no gravy) mild. This is similar in flavor to the \"regular chili chicken\" but crunchy pieces around the edges. They also give you aside of rice, but with it dry you don't really need the rice as much. Both good. We also get the special hakka chow mein in vegetarian.  The noodles are soft and delicious!   The place is not by any means fancy. There are quite a few tables but the place does get packed at lunch and dinner hours. If giving an honest opinion; the place is best for take out."}
{"text":"Heaving back to Montreal from a client site, I decided to stop here for a quick lunch.  Situated in old St-Jean across the street from a cinema theater this little restaurant serves Asian styled meals that ultimately was about as average as it gets compared to some other places I tend to go eat.  I ordered their \"Combo Meal # 4\" that came with a variety of small plates.  The spring rolls were the best thing I've eaten here. They were just the right amount of crunchy, the sauce was the perfect mixture or sweet and sour and the insides of the rolls moist and tender. Yummy!  I didn't like their lemony chicken (the sauce was completely off) as well as the vegetables (they were overcooked).  The mini-ribs were very small yet perfectly right, the sauce was great and the fried rice hit the spot.  The service was slow but there was only 1 waitress working about 15 tables.  The price was a bit expensive for what it was.  Lastly, the food from this place reminded me of Buffet Fu Lam a lot where you'd get mediocre food from food bins and you'd fill your plate. Nothing except eh spring rolls stood out for me."}
{"text":"This review is for their chili chicken only. Got their chili chicken (dry) for takeout. It is one of the best I've had. Spicy but not too spicy so that it kills the flavour. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to where my old office building was. We called this restaurant the company cafeteria because so many employees would flock over there for a cheap, filling lunch.   I have eaten here a handful of times. I find the food to be okay. The chilli chicken is a whole lot of heat. I ordered the Hakka chicken chow mein and it was too greasy for my liking.   On Friday, my manager had a huge craving for Manchurian fish (dry). He loves this place. I simply wanted a break from work, so I tagged along.   I ordered the Manchurian chicken with hot and sour soup. My boss said that \"[I was] going to die\" because both items are spicy. I can actually take the heat. I don't do it too often.   I am still alive. The hot and sour soup was good. There was a bit of heat. I wished that the mushrooms weren't canned ones.   My Manchurian chicken with gravy dish came next. The spring roll was crispy and delicious. I rarely like them. My fish was spicy and flavourful. I was impressed.   My manager was waiting to see my face turn red due to the spiciness of what I had ordered. It never happened. I also completely polished my plate. It was good.   Perhaps I should stick with ordering this dish when I am here. It's pretty cheap ($8.99 plus tax) to have a good lunch.   (87)"}
{"text":"For cheap Chinese food this is my go to place. I as many other people have been going there for decades and it has been the same selection the whole time. It has a nice selection to chose from and is very customer orientated.  Contrary to some food aficionados on here there palate must be far superior to the common folks who eat here. One tip if you ask for white rice they will get it for you I mean its a Asian restaurant for Pete's sake!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered takeout, it was fresh tasting and ready in 15min Yes the decor in the place is nothing fantastic, very basic, but their food exceeded my expectations in a great way  Chili chicken and Manchurin beef was moist and full of flavor. Highly recommended  Will eat here again for sure"}
{"text":"Its westernized, non authentic Chinese food in a great location and run by Chinese.  The place is dingy and gets busy at food hours.  They do have good combos where they serve you soup, egg rolls and tea with rice and some sort of meat and veggie dish for $7.99 that will fill you up.  If you are craving Chinese food (if you can call it that), then go for it.  Otherwise, I'd skip it."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on the ratings in Yelp... that proved to be a mistake.  I'm baffled as to why other raters gave this place such a thumbs up.  It is indeed small and plain-- to the point of being distressed.  The sidewalk leading up to the restaurant was spotted with the prehistoric remains of past masticated chewing gum.  The handle of the front door was sticky.    Inside there was a very small and dingy dining room decorated in \"early depression\".  There was a small, short, serving area featuring about 10 to 12 entrees, none of which were appetizing.  I tried a little of everything on the line and I have nothing nice to say about any of it.  The chicken and fish were so breaded that I can't honestly say I ever encountered any meat inside for which the dish was named. When I pushed on one of the pieces of sesame chicken with a fork, a thick, oily fluid oozed out of the breading.  The few vegetables available were limp and over cooked.  The egg drop soup was tasteless and the meatballs may have been made of packing foam.  To be fair, I can't say that this was the worst Chinese buffet my wife and I have ever encountered... but it did make the bottom ten list.  Yes the employees are friendly and the prices are very reasonable... but then, I guess you get what you pay for; so if your budget is restricted and your expectations aren't very high this would be the place for you to fill the void in your gut.  If you are looking for flavor and a dining experience, I think you would have better luck in an inner city soup kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is horrible... I read the mixed reviews and decided to try it!... Worst \"china buffet\" I've ever been too... Not only bland interior, smells funky, there was some meat ball thing in a pan... It looked like greasy grey colored meat balls.... I'll pass, I took one bite of my \"sesame chicken\" and cannot  get the shyte taste out of my mouth.... I knew I should've taken my girlfriend to the family diner we passed on the way here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is small, but they give excellent service and are very attentive. I have been coming here for years and I love their fried rice and egg drop soup. Also, the sesame chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"So incredibly disgusting!!! When comparing this place to other Chinese food buffet locations in the area avoid this one like the Black Plague! Anything deep fried here I can almost guarantee came from a freezer and there was more fat than meat on any of my chicken that I picked up, after trying one plate I asked my boyfriend if we could leave because I was getting physically ill. The service is also terrible, it must be family run because there were random people sleeping at other tables while we there.....?!??!?  Also, it's the smallest buffet known to man kind.  20 minutes after leaving this place I was throwing up off the side of 19th ave, I wouldn't suggest anyone coming here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the same americhino fare that you had here in 1983, well, there it is.  Same menu, same recipes, same grease. There's nothing too terrible about their greasy, fried:  (rice, egg rolls, chicken, chicken wings, sesame chicken, onion rings, egg foo young, s&s pork, and jello). Yes, even the jello was deep fried and greasy.  Not really. There's just not much selection, and what you get is 'mbleh'. (that's half 'meh' and half 'blah') Everyone keeps saying \"well, at least it's only $6.\"   Well, for that price, I could pick from a half dozen gems within a mile radius of this nostalgic black hole boofay of yester-year. But I'll generously round them up -  they're friendly, the food's tasty and filling, and fuggit it was only $6."}
{"text":"Another regular stop for me when I am in Toronto. No such food like this in Montreal so I need to get my Hakka fix!!! We normally order all the manchurian dishes, Dry and extra spice.  I just cannot understand how they get the fish so tender and does not fall apart!! The food is so tasty that they must use some kind of enchanting drug to keep me going back for more!!! I already miss the place.  This trip I went twice, once a group of 6 and then 10."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I have never written a yelp review before in my entire life but felt personally obligated to do so to alert and inform innocent people of not making the same catastrophic mistake that I did today which was dining at this atrocious establishment.  I am not a picky person, never been a complainer but this restaurant is a disgrace to every individual in the restaurant business let alone Chinese restaurant business and this is in no way an exaggeration. The mere fact that this place is allowed to exist is a crime against humanity.   Egg rolls: literally puked it back it up and chugged water to keep it down and avoid a scene   Sesame chicken: certainly not chicken  Sweet and sour pork: Rough.. Really really rough.  Onion rings: looked like a brain. Couldn't justify trying it after my experience with other food   I wanted to give this place something but I Really struggled to find even one redeeming quality about it I guess if I had to say the rice wasn't so bad but hard to f that up. Also the waiter and owner were very kind although I almost laughed in his face when he asked if this was my first time there as if I would ever return.. I don't think an establishment like this could realistically have any repeat customers. I just can't imagine a single human being enjoying this poor excuse for food.  I wouldn't recommend china garden to my worst enemy and can truly say I wish this place burns to the ground and everything it it disintegrates into nothingness."}
{"text":"A go-to spot for me whenever I'm near the airport. Decent Hakka-style cuisine, especially the chilli chicken, with an extensive and diverse menu. Decent lunch specials. Minus points for the appearance and slow service, but if you can look past that it's definitely worth a try. Food is on the milder side, so for the fellow fire breathers, you'll have to emphasize that you'd like things extra spicy."}
{"text":"The classic indian chinese place near the airport.  Food is very nice, we had the fish and chili chicken lead by the chicken pakora.  Wow the flavors and tastes were just amazing. Make this a stop on your way home from YYZ or on the way to the Airport."}
{"text":"China Garden buffet. is awesome  don't know what the other people were talking about on this review  Great food great staff   The owners are great  . used to go to one that was on 51st Ave. and Thunderbird Great memories there  but they only have one  left.  In fact I was there today so much food that I can have a meal for two days .  Thanks again China Garden keep it up"}
{"text":"I went yesterday with my family, have been coming here for years, but the last 2 times were literally bad, the place has really gone downhill from its glory days of line ups out the door..  My only guess is that the cook has changed, a cook for any restaurant is the main driver.   I always order the same thing, as there only specialty is Chilli Chicken Dry. There was to much ginger in which i left the plate more than half after getting immediate heart burn. This was the only dish that really made the restaurant, as the interior decor is way outdated and grimy.  I will never go back."}
