{"text":"I love this place. 

I will get the bad out of the way first... There isn't a good day to go where you won't have to wait in line for a good 15-20 minutes at least. But Saturday/Sunday are definitely the worst - and don't even bother going on holidays. 

However, it's completely worth the wait. The food is amazing. Everything is fried in duck fat - which only after eating here did I realize how much better I felt after eating it. I love that I can stuff my face with this beautiful food and not feel like I drank a bucket of grease after. You leave feeling full, without having to fear the food baby you are carrying around all afternoon. 

My favourite thing is the French Toast. I get it almost every single time I'm there. It's quite light. It's sweet - but not too sweet. It has a nice orangey zest to it, and served with warm maple syrup. Delicious.

I could eat here every day. You get your money's worth completely."}
{"text":"I wish this place wasn't so busy all the time! But I do understand why it is, because its seriously delicious. I've had a number of different items and have enjoyed each one. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it.

Its definitely the place to go on when you're feeling lazy on a Sunday morning and want to have a nice breakfast in a nice environment. I appreciate the simplicity of the food, the nice interior designs. The coffee was good too. 

Also, its pretty small place so it may be hard to find a table if there's more than 4 people. Its best for 2 people in my opinion."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort breakfast food.  I would give it five stars if it weren't always so busy.  You'd have to get there right when it opens to avoid a line up."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I've ever hand, anywhere in the world. I had no idea what I was in for, but I figured since there was a 90min wait, that it must be good, but I had no idea it could be tHIS good. They help you with the wait by use of an app where you can add yourself to their wait list and it keeps you posted of your place in line so you don't have to just stand there and wait. I had truffled squash eggs Benny. YEAH"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place. We took our out of town guests here, thrilled to have treated them to fresh, local foods! All very impressed. Very good food, and great service.. I work in the industry so I have high expectations on the odd occasion that I get to be served, and served we were! Thanks OEB!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. The food is absolutely great! The staff are nice and I can't find another breakfast place that compares.
wise.

I originally complained about this restaurant for the lack of space, and gave this 4 out of 5 stars. However, the owner took the time to contact me and let me know that there is already plans put in place to expand space and that this is simply a leasing issue. 
So I am giving this place 5 stars, because it may currently suck to be outside waiting to get in...but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with a good variety on the menu. It's not a big place so be prepared for a lengthy wait on weekends. My tip: go early and during the week."}
{"text":"This is a small breakfast dive off Edmonton Trail. Decor is meh and the lineups on weekends are ridiculous, but the food here is pretty good. There are probably worst breakfast places to go to, but if you have the time to kill, this is a place worth checking out once."}
{"text":"A mix of experiences here. Checked in online using the No Wait app, which was okay. The hostesses were disorganized, and the wait for newcomers was two hours. When we finally did sit down, our server was slow. It took 15 minutes just to order our meal, which came fast and was delicious. In the mean time, the family next to us were served incorrectly, and (who I thought to be) the manager behaved as though he was doing them a massive favour by not charging to remake their meals. 

It then took over ten minutes to get our bill after our plates were cleared. No wonder there's a two hour wait! 

The biggest problem here isn't the food... I would probably eat here again, but it won't be any time soon."}
{"text":"A place definitely worth visiting when in Calgary. Do come early or else it can be a long wait as this place does get pack fast. Luckily when me and my girlfriend came we grab the last open table so we didn't have to wait. 

The food is amazing. Although we both got a breakfast platter. everything was cooked to perfection. Home fries and Toast were not over done and retain their crispness without being saturated with oil. Thin layer of butter for just the fight amount of taste. The boxed breakfast looked interesting but we were too full to try. 

Excellent service and polite. Will come again."}
{"text":"OEB Oh Eat Eat - Whether it be actual brekkie grub or a burger for the early morn disinclined, it's tasty, with great decor, but a tad bit pricey. Any addition, however, to the dearth of breakus places in Calgary is always good. It's not very spacious, so if you need your eggs on, get there early. For brekko on Ed Trail, you can't go wrong with OEB or Diner Deluxe."}
{"text":"Always great service. Love that I can call ahead for takeout instead of waiting in long lines, or use the NoWait app to keep my place. Their eggs are the best and I always grab a basket when I'm there. Favourite thing on the menu has to be their Gold Digga box - I'd definitely suggest everyone try it. The shaved truffle makes it so tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It it adorable inside with really cool decor and chalkboard ceiling. They have tables and chairs as well as one long high top table (which personally we prefer because it can get a bit noisy in there).

We tend to go there during the week and usually don't have to wait long for a table even though they are busy (like 10 minutes maybe). But if you are going on the weekend I suggest an early breakfast (like when they open) or you will be waiting a long time (like over an hour). Some people don't mind this but personally it's not for me, so we make a point of going on weekdays. 

The service is great. The waitresses are always super cheerful and the food comes out really fast. And the food of course is delicious. Coffee is good (a little light for my taste but still yummy). The menu is pretty large but they have some by the front door so you can check it out while you wait :)

Their eggs are so orange and flavorful and the meats are fantastic. Have not eaten anything here that was any less than amazing! The potatoes that they serve with dishes are so good that if I only are those for the rest of my life I think I would be OK with that.

If you have never been I seriously suggest you check them out. Just go early."}
{"text":"Can't believe this is my first visit. Won't be my last. Came with a group of four and our items included the Bratwurst, the lox box, the gold digga box, and my dish... braised truffle squash (made as a benny at the recommendation of the server).

Well, blown away is an understatement. My breakfast, the squash benny was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Soft poached egg cooked perfectly, potatoes were amazing seasoned to perfection, fruit was beautifully plated, and the flavors in the dish were other worldly. I loved it.

My dining companions were also super happy with their dishes. Service was attentive and very friendly. They also have great coffee! Winner right here."}
{"text":"So I could eat brunch just about any time of the day, any day of the week.  And when the food is this good, it's hard to resist.  This was my third time there, and this time I tried the Gold Digga boxed meal.  Duck confit roast potatoes, cheese curds, black truffles and pork belly pieces, topped with a couple poached eggs covered with hollandaise sauce.  Absolutely delicious!  The quality is top notch, and this boxed meal really packs a punch.  It's a good size meal with lots of flavor.  Lots of other boxed meals to try as well, so need to go back and try another!"}
{"text":"My friend and I strolled into OverEasy on a Monday afternoon for brunch, and it was surprisingly busy! 
The first thing i noticed were the extremely friendly staff. The second thing, was the light, airy decor, which is important for such a small space.
I appreciated that the menu had many options to choose from. In fact, it made my decision extremely hard, and this is probably the most extensive menu I've seen at a breakfast spot yet.
Choices included the standard fare of eggs dishes, pancakes, waffles, and yogurt and granola. Additionally, they have crepes, the cheapest eggs benny around town thus far, and something called a breakfast bowl.
The prices are very reasonable, although the add-on items seemed a bit expensive ($3.49 for two small sausages).
I finally - finally! - chose the French Toast with Strawberries, and no complaints. The fruit was fresh, the french toast not too battered or dry, and they didn't overpowder it with icing sugar. The side sausages were done to perfection, and were super tasty, though a bit fatty.
I'd also like to mention that they have gluten free options, as well as organic coffee, although I have yet to try them. All in all, thsi is one of the better breakfast places in Calgary. And like all of these little places located on Edmonton Trail, be prepared to wait in line a while if you go peak time on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the uptown location and decided to give the new dt location a try. The food was just as good, but the service needs working on.

While we were there, we witness a group who specifically requested not to sit at the high table since it would be extremely inconvenient for a preggo to get up and down. Unfortunately for them, their request was not accommodated and there was no other tables available at the time. I was glad they finally got a normal table after another one finally opened up after 15 minutes. We also saw a family with a ~1 yr old that end up at the high table later.

Anyways, not very family friendly if the staffs ignore requests for ppl with young families and preggo. I understand it's a busy place, but servers need to take requests seriously."}
{"text":"My sister and her boyfriend go to Overeasy a lot and took me there on Easter sunday when I was in town visiting.

Awesome little spot! Surprisingly no line up or wait (maybe it was because of the holiday). 

Service was amazing! And the food was even better. Great fresh squeezed OJ with pulp (yummy), fantastic eggs Benny with smoked salmon and the 'soul in a box' in an absolute must have! It's their version of poutine with wedge fries, hollandaise sauce, cheese and bacon! Solo awesome. 

Prices are totally reasonable too! Definitely worth another visit..."}
{"text":"OEB was excellent.  The pancakes were some of the best I have ever had.  I would give the pancakes 5 stars.  The \"Soul in a Bowl\" was okay not great.  Coffee was good.  Our server was very excellent.    Overall experience was excellent and I would give it a 4.5."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when it's impossible to get in on the weekends, right?

Or are we just that terrible at cooking our own breakfasts?

Still, Overeasy is better at it.

I met a friend for breakie this morning. He had eggs, Spolumbo's sausage and toast.

I went for the Muesli, oats and yogurt with a slice of fresh, warm pumpkin loaf. Oh so delish ... it didn't even need butter.

Plus, I have leftover Muesli sitting next to me on my desk. I can't wait.

The quarters are a bit crampy, going on memory from a weekend jaunt to Overeasy, but it's far more spacious if you hit it on a weekday morning. The new owners - I can't for the life of me remember the old name of the restaurant, may have been Cozy Cafe or something - took away the tables in the middle and put up a long bar table.

Service is pleasant, your coffee is always topped up and breakfast came quickly so we could both rush off to our morning meetings, neither of which actually came to fruition. Ha!"}
{"text":"Ive had a better eating experience waking up behind a dumpster with cheetos in my mouth and a rat licking my face.  I wouldn't go there if I owned it."}
{"text":"Bit expensive for breakfast (~$20 per person), but the food is quite exquisitely prepared. Not exactly worth the wait or the cash, however. (About half of my meal was solely potatoes, and not the best potatoes I've ever had either.)"}
{"text":"The best guacamole I have ever had!! What a great little urban, trendy place.  The food is all fresh and delicious & the service is top notch. Parking is a huge problem."}
{"text":"I went to OEB this morning, and of course there was a line up ! 

Their waiting area sucks, actually there was no waiting area, people could only stand by the front door. After 20 mins waiting, finally we seated. I order soul in a bowl which was kind of salty for me, or maybe because i have mouth ulcer. 

My boyfriend order the traditional bonny which has two poached eggs,  smoked ham on Hollandaise,  crispy duck fat fries and a great portion of fresh fruits. That was so delicious. My coffee was refilled often. Even though the place is tinny, but the food and services are awesome. I will definitely go back and try more yummy dishes there !!"}
{"text":"Best food out there for breakfast or brunch. Excellent quality meats of choice. Duck, lobster, scallops, bacon, pork, rabbit, duck fat tatters to die for. Busy yes but worth the wait !!! I died and went to heaven with the duck confit perogies. Great atmosphere. Why are you reading this ? book a reservation and go now you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food here!! Everything on the menu is very appealing! Portions are quite generous too :) only thing that bothers me is the wait... LOL"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a saturday. We had about 8 people and we got in after 45 minutes (not bad). So this is a pretty small place and you should expect a wait if you are coming here on a weekend during brunch time. 

On to the food. I tried the duck, gold digger and lobster crepe. The food was excellent! We finished everything on our plates. 

Service was good, we got in, got drinks, ordered, waited a bit (couldn't have been long) and ate and was along our way. I would definately come back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago right after the Stampede parade. Finally something different than the typical brunch food! Even though there are eggs, it's duck eggs. And instead of fries, they have fries cooked in duck fat. The first impression is that menu offers a good variety of brunch food with a twist and beers. 

The presentation of the food made us and a few others in the next table go 'wow'! And when it comes to portion size, these guys don't skimp on it. For the ingredients slightly out of the norm, I can see why the price is a little higher than the typical brunch food cafe.

Despite the 20 minute wait for a late 2pm lunch, this is definitely a place we will come back to. Just make sure you're not already starving when you stand in line!"}
{"text":"Great meal, but overpriced and the drinking restrictions are absurd! No Bailey's in my coffee before 10am? No thank you. Finely fresh eggs with all the fixings a heart can desire. The eggs Benny selection is vast and arranged for whatever adventure your heart desires."}
{"text":"This has been my favourite breakfast spot for a long time but I never went often because I couldn't stand the long wait times. I was so exited when I found out their working with No Wait App because now I can get in line before I actually get there. It's so convenient I can actually eat here all the time! There is a lot of variety on the menu and both the savoury and sweet dishes are really good! One of my favourite things is the herb potato wedges cooked in duck fat...mmmm. Therefore by adding cheese curds, poached eggs, brown butter hollandaise and bacon to it makes it perfect! I'll have to try the other variations of the soul in the bowl next time."}
{"text":"We should have know from the line out the door this was the home of promising offerings. Excellent breakfast and service, would definitely recommend for a creative twist on classic breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I ordered traditional eggs Benny and it was the best I've ever had. Inviting atmosphere with quick service makes for a great breakfast spot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"my eggs benny were delicious. a bit crowded for my taste but the food and service were great."}
{"text":"Used to go frequently, line up or not. Love this place - great service, funky décor, yummy food...what else do you need on a frosty Sunday morning (or any morning, for that matter)? Possibly my favorite of all places (when I wasn't vegan yet). Thank you for the memories OEB!"}
{"text":"There are two locations: the one on Edmonton trail and the one downtown. The one downtown is an absolute DISASTER. Staff/management are extremely rude - they act as though they are doing you a massive favour by seating you. First, they give preferential treatment and seat people who haven't been waiting and/or are not on the \" no wait\" app. Next, our waitress was incredibly grouchy, as if we had done something to offend her.  OEB used to me one of my favourite spots to dine at, unfortunately not even the good food is worth it because the atmosphere is awful. I understand that this location can get very busy but there are different ways to deal with it. A simple smile goes a long way.  In my opinion, the reputation and image of OEB is being ruined bc of the hostile environment at the downtown location."}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this... Maybe calgary just doesn't have that great of a food scene? 

The staff took forever acknowledging my party. Weren't friendly and had to wave them down for everything.

Decor, meh.

The food was good but I was just so bummed with the service. Maybe an off day... For all of them?"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite breakfast places in town! I love the originality of the dishes - and that I can always find a meal that I'm looking for with avocado. The servers are also always great, which is nice in a busy breakfast place."}
{"text":"I almost didn't review this place because I don't want it to get any busier!  It is a bit small, and seems to get more popular every week.

Its easy to see why, it is the best breakfast in Calgary.  They have the best pancake I've ever had.  If you think 'what is so special about a pancake?', then you have never had one at Overeasy!

The crepe's are also amazing.  Try the CPS special.  They also have crazy huge donut thing that you just have to order.

And if you're a meat lover, try the butcher's block special.  It is basically just a huge mound of amazing meats and pate with a big chuck of cheese and some bread.  Leave your vegetarian friends at home if you order this one.

The staff is great, very friendly, and its usually the same girls.  I always think that if a place is able to retain the same staff month after month, they must be doing something right.  Especially when they're good!

There isn't much for free parking in the area, but trust me, it's worth spending the $1 to park in the pay lot."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My bf first introduced me to OEB when we first started dating a few years back and has since been one of our favourite restaurants, and our absolute favourite breakfast place! The food is unmatched! Lox in a box is my go to - absolutely delicious!! The lineups to get in should speak volumes."}
{"text":"LOVE the breakfast here! Their lox box is amazing! Anytime I am craving breakfast food OEB is my first thought. And It has a hipster vibe which is pretty cool - very Vancouver ish"}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast. Best food I've ever had for breakfast. Everything was fresh and you can tell it's made with a great deal of thought. If I lived in Calgary I would eat here several times a week!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it four stars only because the wait is so long! When I'm craving brunch I want to instantaneously. I love the menu, it is always hot, delicious, and plentiful. Definitely worth the time. 

I love their hollandaise and potatoes!"}
{"text":"I love the gold digga here!! So tasty!! great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Okay this little place is definitely full of surprises! :) Went there on Thursday around 11am and there is a line already on a WEEKDAY! The menu is innovative which is refreshing and is also extensive for a small place. I can tell the owner puts a lot of heart and thoughts into it. The place is very small and we got seated at the counter table with a bunch of strangers, which is very uncomfortable but all this suffering is worthy when you have great food on the table. I ordered a traditional egg benedict which is cooked and seasoned beautifully with golden yolk running down. My friend ordered a duck breast box (can't remember the exact name). The duck is juicy and cooked just about right. The fries is cooked with duck fat and tastes fantastic! This is definitely my favoriate brunch place in town. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Not your everyday diner, primarily because 1) the lineup is always too damn long, and 2) you would surely go into cardiac arrest if you ate there with any regularity.  As such, OEB (over easy breakfast) is a GREAT spot to go if you feel you've earned a decadent savoury breakfast.  

In particular, the various boxed breakfasts such as the \"Gold Digga\" are stupendous: duck-fat fried potatoes, brown butter hollandaise, soft poached eggs, black truffles, cheese curds and crispy pork belly...and optionally foie gras.  If you're getting the foie gras, why not pair it with a mini bottle of sparkling blush wine while you're at it?  You get the idea. The sweet breakfasts are okay, but aren't as over-the-top as the savoury ones, and are about the same price, so it's a little harder to justify waiting in the long lines if you're peckish for something bready/sweet. e.g. my wife had to really dig to find the pittance of the creme anglaise on her waflles.  

Did I mention the long lines? Foul weather doesn't seem to abate them much either. Additionally, there is some inconsistency in the queueing system: some hostesses will take your cell number and call you when a table's ready, while other times you just have to stand there. If you are lucky, you'll be in line when they are handing out complimentary coffee & slices of banana bread.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend after the wait at diner deluxe was reDONCulous! There was a bit of a wait here too, but our friendly waitress kept us informed on the wait time progress AND served us coffees outside! Once we were seated with menus it was a tough choice. My boyfriend and I chose omelets and my sister had what I believe was French toast with marshmallows(!!!) the omeletes were both delicious and filling, and included nicely seasoned potato cubes and generous fruit slices. The marshmallow toast MUST have been good too as my sister polished it off before I was able to steal a bite. ;-)
So in summary...Great service and great food! I will be back for my own marshmallowey breakfast!"}
{"text":"Brand new location, just opened November 1st, 2017.  Amazing food and atmosphere, great service.  This location is, as are all the others,  VERY busy which speaks to the quality of food and service.

I was there this morning and had the water foul benny (duck, eggs benedict), it was AMAZING.  It came with duck fat potato wedges that were also out of this world delicious. 

Be prepared to wait, 45-120 mins on average, if you're going to walk in for brunch without a reservation.  Luckily I was eating alone and was seated right away at the bar. 

I would highly recommend using the nowait app to waitlist yourself to avoiding waiting long in line, a great option I wish more brunch places offered.  They do also offer ordering take out if you just want the food and can live without the ambiance."}

{"text":"My favorite breakfast place anywhere. Superb boxed dishes. Visit this place every time I'm in Calgary"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in Calgary. Tried 10-15 different things on the menu and I've loved every one. Can't wait to try more. The place is small, meaning long waits, but trust me... It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Woohoo! What a cute little breakfast place! If you want to eat breakfast for lunch or even brunch - be prepared to wait! We were there pretty much 30 minutes after opening, and we already had to wait! The food was in large portions, and cooked to perfection!  Parking is street parking, but after a meal from OEB, you need that walk!"}
{"text":"Went to the new location of OEB on a Sunday a little after 2 and there was a 10/15 minute wait. 
I had read reviews of OEB and looked at the menu online so was really looking forward to the meal.
It's hard to see the restaurant from the other side of the street so you're gonna wanna know where the restaurant is before going.

They were out of pork belly by the time we got there so we got the meatball box and the lox box. The waitress recommended we do half spinach half potatoes instead of the full amount of potatoes and we were so glad we did- there were still plenty of potatoes in our boxes (which were perfectly crispy when they first came out) but the spinach helped to break up the heaviness of the other ingredients. I also liked that they asked how we wanted our eggs poached (runny, medium, etc)

Both of us loved our boxes and wanted to try everything else on the menu.

The decor of the space was also really cool- they have an oversized \"bird cage\" in the middle that also functions as a table."}
{"text":"Really really good and original food. Their stools are very uncomfortable and hurt my back. Long waits but that can be avoided by booking a table online."}
{"text":"Awesome, worth the wait time delicious! I had foie gras poutine, with black truffle oMG! Heaven! Hubby had salmon he loved it all too. Server fantastic. Be patchiness and line up you won't be disappointed. Prices on the higher end but the portion size is what makes it!!!"}
{"text":"best breakfast in town.. the only thing that I don't like is the space is very tight, not all the chairs are comfortable and it's always busy .. otherwise it my favourite place to have brunch"}
{"text":"Ate here for the second time after a long hiatus. The food was excellent as ever, especially the crispy duck fat fried potatoes. 

I was a little disappointed by the service. As with many restaurants that become really popular, the servers seem to feel its a privilege for the customer to eat at the restaurant rather than the other way around. We waited about half an hour for a table (no biggie- it's popular) but during the meal had about three servers, all who were brusque and bordering on rude. Huffs and puffs when one of us took some time deciding, plates were clattered down, and the server acted angry when I tried to pay with plastic (only cash or debit)

All in all, really enjoyed the food but the service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"The ambiance is good and the food is delicious! They have fries that are fried in duck fat and unusual breakfast items like poutine & duck confit. I suggest coming early though because there's always a line-up. Food & services is great overall!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm a huge fan of unique breakfast food. I don't like to go out for breakfast and pay someone to make me eggs and bacon and toast. I can do that at home in my pjs. What I would like is a little 'soul in a bowl', which is exactly what OEB promises.

I first tried this place the morning after my birthday back in October. As you can imagine, not everyone in our party of 3 was in tip top condition.We arrived around 10:30 and there was obviously a line up. It was a slightly chilly morning, but thankfully we were dressed for it and the delightful coffee was of great assistance in both the warmth and hangover cure factors.

We were seated at the bar down the middle beside another group who we were able to chat with pleasantly. (downside to the bar: The bar stools don't have backs, but there are purse hooks under the table. BONUS!) After sitting down our server was very attentive and seemed to be able to read tables very well. (SIDE NOTE: This is something I greatly appreciate in the service industry. If you can't read people at least moderately well, find a new industry.) She could clearly tell we were the kind of people who like to chat and joke around and she indulged us charmingly, and seemed legitimately happy to be serving breakfast on a Saturday morning.

The food. They had a couple specials, which I think is great in a breakfast place, it keeps me from getting bored with a menu. I ended up ordering one of the Blue Plate Specials, the Breakfast dumplings & duck confit. With only 10 orders made daily, I figured it had to be something special. And it was. All the flavors of the egg, caramelized onions, duck, and bacon vinaigrette just blended perfectly. If there is every a complaint about this dish, it might be that the portion is not huge, but for me it was just perfect. A great breakfast without feeling like I'm going to explode. However, the portion size of my two friends meals were both quite large and we ended up taking some of theirs home. (Unfortunately, I don't remember what these dishes were as I was too obsessed with my own, but everyone was raving)

All in all, I have nothing bad to say about this place. For those who complain about wait times, I ask, have you been out for breakfast in Calgary? Wait is a part of the experience, get over it. Also, all good things are worth waiting for right?"}
{"text":"I went to OEB a couple of weeks ago for lunch.  There was lots of street parking nearby, which was great, and it's easy to find the restaurant.  As you enter, you'll immediately notice that it's pretty small, and as someone else has noted it's probably best for groups of two (though four people shouldn't have TOO much trouble, especially on weekdays and at off-peak hours).  There is a long bar with high stools in the middle of the room, which looked very uncomfortable to me.  Definitely hold out for a table.

For lunch I had the Sunrise Omelette, with eggs, artichokes, tomatoes, spinach and pesto.  It was quite good, especially as I love my eggs to be on the very, very cooked side.  It came with okay toast and potatoes, though the fruit garnish (grapes and an orange slice) looked kind of dull.  My friend had Eggs Benedict, and declared them to be perfectly acceptable, but nothing special.  Portions were big, so this would be a great place for a weekend brunch after a late night of partying!   Also, the menu is pretty varied for a restaurant so small, so you're likely to find something for everyone in your group.  I would go back just to try something else.  

One complaint though: On their website, every time you click to a different section of the menu the annoying background noise comes back on.  Would it be possible to make it click- and STAY- off?"}
{"text":"As with all breakfast places, there is almost always a line out the door at Overeasy breakfast.  Even on a Monday afternoon I had to stand waiting in the little doorway area for at least 15 minutes before I got seated.  I was offered a cup of coffee while I waited which I gladly accepted.

The café is small and seats approximately 30 people.  There's a big bar-height table in the centre of the room which gives a communal feel to the place.  There's a chalk board on the ceiling decorated by the staff, so take a peek above your head when you're waiting in line or seated at your table.  

There's a good variety of items on the menu with all sorts of breakfast items in addition to some delicious sounding sandwiches. I finally decided on benny's with smoked salmon which was really quite awesome.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the spinach was fresh and the sauce was not too heavy.  Bliss in a bite.

It's a shame that this place is so small.  It's not ideal to be waiting outside in the cold during winter and the little doorway area can only hold so many people before you start feeling like your personal space is being invaded. 
 
Is it worth the wait?  Absolutely.  Loved everything about my meal from food to service and everything in between.  Just be aware that you could have a bit of a wait before you'll be able to indulge."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding!  Using the waitlist tool on yelp, we were able to walk right in for breakfast on Saturday morning.  Our server forgot about during our meal--no coffee refills or check ins--but the rest of the staff made up for her.  All in all, an awesome way to spend a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"OEB has become my favourite spot to have breakfast/brunch! This time around we were lucky enough to be seated right away. Typically there's a 10-15 min wait and in some cases longer, but it's well worth it. I find that service is attentive and very energetic, but I'd say that this trip the service was just average (nothing to cry about though). 
My girlfriend had the \"Do not even go there french toast\". Their french toast is nice and fluffy, and when you stuff it with New York cheesecake how can you go wrong lol! I don't think I could eat it for breakfast and be satisfied though because I would need something salty, but as a dessert it's perfect!
Eggs Benny is usually one of my favourite choices for breakfast, so I chose the \"Canadian Eh\". The poached eggs were cooked perfectly (soft for me), the pea meal bacon gave the dish the perfect amount of salt, the hollandaise had the perfect consistency and the potato wedges cooked in duck fat are always piping hot and flavourful. The fruit rounds the whole dish off with some freshness.
I don't think I'll ever get sick of this place. The next time you're on Edmonton trail check it out!"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of OEB, i love the eggs benny and I find the sides are perfect as well.

They have a wide variety on thier menu which is perfect.. your guarenteed to find something your craving. I cant wait to try more on the menu!


The only downfall is the wait to get into the place.. my suggestion would be to come early on weekends!! It is definitly worth it for the price and quantity.

This is my new fav breafkast spot!"}
{"text":"EVERYONE DOWNLOAD THE NO WAIT APP & RESERVE YOUR PLACE IN LINE. It's saved me from hours of waiting & I can still get my brunch on weekends. Just wake up a bit earlier, reserve your spot, sleep a little longer, head over when you're around 7/6th in line. This is one of Calgary's best brunch spots but waiting sucks. Currently watching many parties walking away because of 2-3hr wait.

Tomorrow is Mother's day! So don't keep your moms waiting & make sure you reserve a spot!

I don't really need to talk about the food right? We all know it's great. Happy brunchin'"}
{"text":"Good stuff I love the Belgium waffle with fruit. They should have more options for people who need to substitute eggs"}
{"text":"OEB has really fresh food and since they're on the NoWait app now, the wait times are manageable as long as you get your name on there early enough. I always just make the wrong decisions when choosing items in the menu! There's too many to choose from and I'm not an egg benny person (if you love egg benny's, this is the place to be). I would highly recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place! But, make sure you go when you're not in a rush as it's always busy; I've been here 3-4 times and I've never waited less than 40min for a table. I'm a late riser though (arrive 9:30-10:30am), so maybe it's better early morning? I always like to bring my friends from out of town for a special treat."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!

We came in on a Friday morning around 9:30 am and there was no wait for a table for two. Once we were sat they quickly came to take our drink orders, the coffee and hand squeezed orange juice was fantastic! We ordered the nutella french toast, waffle and a side of bacon, the french toast was two pieces or thick french toast with melty nutella and toasted marshmallows in the middle. It tasted like a s'more!!!! So freaking good! The waffle looked wonderful as well.

The decor is really interesting and unique which makes the experience very enjoyable. The service was quick and friendly, they really try to get people in and out because of the line to get in but they don't mind if you take your time and chat with your friends. 

I would recommend getting there early because by the time we left it was an hour wait for a table.

I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with great food and excellent service. Smoked duck, poached eggs, brown butter hollandaise and twice cooked potatoes. Killer breakfast has left me thinking about going back again the next day! I may be a bit obsessed, truth be told....! I can't wait to go back I saw waffles I want but I'll have to go back with friends so we can share, if they'll let me that is. The line ups can be long but I honestly believe that the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"We went here in the late afternoon to try to avoid the morning rush, but it was still extremely busy. The long wait in sweltering heat made us all a little bit grumpy, but our waitress, who was nothing short of absolutely charming, took this in stride. We quickly warmed to her and ordered the banana bread French toast with chocolate ganache, the French toast trifle, and the blue plate special. The food was delicious!  The banana bread French toast could be made even better with a salty component, such as a salted caramel. It was really more of a dessert, but it was a really exciting item to try. The sausage and eggs with the blue plate special were some of the best I've had, and the pancake was outstanding.

We will definitely be back, and it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I've ever had. We had to wait for over and hour and were skeptical it would pay off, but OEB lived up to it all the way. The duck fat fries are excellent, try the French toast, it's delicious! Our bacon was fried to perfection and the atmosphere feels totally Sunday brunch. If you're in Calgary and craving a good breakfast, go here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have a really poor system here. They do no resos and you will literally wait close to two hours. We were told there were regulars at our table, who weren't eating, and that they weren't going to turn the table over so we would have to wait. There are other great spots around that you should go to and spare yourself wasting your morning for regular food."}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast - had to wait 40 mins for a table on a Sunday so would be worth booking in advance. Great service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Customer service is miserable....at least our waitress (same one last three visits) was miserable.  Blond, tatooed and scowly faced.  Just so you recognize her when you walk in.  Soul in a bowl is amazing, which is why we return."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. The crispy potato wedges were some of the best I have had. They serve cake and coffee to people waiting in line."}
{"text":"From the first time I walked in and saw the decor to the last smile - the place is truly the best in Calgary - the owner came up to our table, introduced himself, a kind and gentle person that cares about the experience his guests have.

We've been back many times and notice that it gets nicer, friendlier, the food more tasty - MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST spot in Calgary for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I had spent a little time reading up on breakfast places and this place seemed very popular.  The reviews did not disappoint because I had such a good meal!  

We arrived on a Friday at about 10:30am, but we still had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated.  The place is a little small and cramped but well worth the food experience.   There was so much on the menu it was hard to choose what to eat.  I kept looking at all the dishes that were coming out of the kitchen and every one of them looked mouth watering.  After recommendations from the waitress, I decided on an omelette with pulled chicken, spinach, and cheddar cheese.  My husband tried some decadent eggs benedict dish they served in a paper to-go container.  It was one of their specials that I forget the name of.  

When our food came out, it looked so good, but when I tasted my dish, it was even better.  Who would have thought pulled chicken in an omelette could be so good?  I also had herb roasted potatoes and fruit on the side.  Everything went together so well, I couldn't have been happier.  My husband thought his dish was very good as well, but it was so heavy he couldn't even finish it.

Overall, if we are ever in Calgary again, we would pay this place a visit....if possible, multiple times!"}
{"text":"I was on a mission to find a place for brunch, and yelpers raved about OEB. With a failed attempt on NYE to go for brunch (stomach flu and such), I tried for a second time last Saturday with 3 gfs (so sex and the city - the city being Calgary, sigh). We went at about 1:15pm, and were told that the wait would be 45 min. We decided to grab a Starbucks before we sat - note to self for future OEB experience, skip the mocha. You need to be starving to eat here.

I was amped to try the famous \"soul in a bowl\", however the starbucks stole that vision and I had decided to gym before brunch - note to self #2 for future OEB experience, skip the gym so you don't calorie count. 

OUR ORDER:

1) I ordered Peter's Favorite - omelette with avocado and feta. Was not a huge fan of the eggs, I found them to be extremely salty. The herbed potatoes were unreal though, and the fruit was fresh and a change from the standard brunch fruit. I also ordered an orange juice on the side, real fresh and tasty. 

2) Healthy Primavera - a friend ordered this, and I tried a bite. Mushrooms, ripe tomatoes, green onions, etc. I found it a lot better than Peter's, and not sure why this isn't Peter's favourite. And also wonder who Peter is. 

3) The other two ordered some fish/egg combos - Smoked Steelhead Salmon and The One That Did Not Get Away.  My friend was in love with the One That Did Not Get Away. I didn't take a huge liking to it, perhaps the distaste for Katy Perry affected my tastebuds. If you enjoy the seafood/egg combo action, you will probably enjoy that Blue Plate Special. 

Overall, the restaurant is super cute and the staff is really friendly. Prices are comparable to other brunch places in the city. 

THINGS TO NOTE:

1) Be prepared to wait
2) Be extremely hungry
3) And ready to work out after, not before. 

I will be back OEB, and I will conquer soul in a bowl."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday, and it was a tiny bit of a mixed experience.

We were in line for a really really long time. I don't mind that, but a 20-30 minute wait that turns into 40 because the table we know will be ours (we'd been told we get the next 2 person table) is empty for 15 minutes but hasn't been bussed is really frustrating. Yes, it's nice that you come round offering complimentary coffee and banana bread, but maybe do a bit less of that and a bit more seating/busing of tables (also: I'd love it if they brought tea around as well) 

By the time we got seated, my friend was vowing we'd never return, no matter how good the food was.

And then, our waitress showed up. She was so cheerful and good at getting us what we asked for - quickly! - and giving recommendations, that my friend went from being a giant grump to smiling. 

Of course, the food may have been involved in that. We got the Tuscan Breakfast (rye sourdough, poached eggs, home potatoes, sundried tomatoes & proscuito) and the Canadian Benny (Ham, poached eggs, english muffins, brown sugar butter hollandaise, home potatoes) . Both were beautifully plated, came with a fair-sized portion of high-quality fruit on the side, and tasted DELICIOUS! They were also served up really quickly, without resulting in any quality loss, which was very impressive. 

Seriously, the Tuscan Breakfast was light yet hearty, a good combination of rich and slightly salty, and overall delicious. 

So much so, I went straight home and made myself sundried tomatoes so I could relive the experience :)

My only qualms were that be CAREFUL: the giant pepper shaker that the waitress carries out to you is actually salt; you really don't need it on the potatoes (they're delicious just is) and if you need pepper, you will have to ask for it (sigh). 

I also got an Earl Grey to drink, and while they carry a very pretty looking organic brand, but it's not worth the $2.60 I paid for the pot of it. 

Overall though, a great meal & great service - although next time, we won't be going at 10am on a Saturday, but for breakfast for dinner!"}
{"text":"Literally waited 2 hrs for a table.  Brunch turned into a late lunch but was it ever worth the wait.  Fresh fruit, tasty coffee, the best eggs Benny I've ever had.  The service more than made up for (or maybe explained?) the wait.  We would come here again and again."}
{"text":"I kind of hate spending 20$ on breakfast, when I can cook pretty decent easy fare for myself at home, but at OEB I will wait in the long line to give them my money. Always great breakfast, even if the service can be a bit slow. Makes sense with how popular and crowded this place is, I don't think they could fit anymore staff back there anyway."}
{"text":"I have been to OEB a couple of times and really enjoyed it. Their food is locally raised/grown which is a plus. Not to mention they have fresh squeezed OJ. My only complaint is that it is small and if you want a seat at a busy time you have to stand up in line outside to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"I LOVE OEB Breakfast. 

Be prepared to wait in line for awhile when you come here. It's that popular! Leave your name with the server and to kill some time before getting a seat, you should walk over to Diva Dave's store just south of the diner (A store that has all sorts of wigs and very tall leather boots and all sorts of interesting things!)

OEB is a gem on Edmonton trail. I've only ever ordered two of their items and I can't seem to convince myself to try others because these two items are so good:

1. Soul In A Bowl. Two poached eggs, the hashbrowns potatoes, cheese curds, slow cooked bacon lardons & brown butter hollandaise. Oh my god. The \"bacon lardons\" (I don't even know what it means but it's like chunky bacon bits made fresh)

2. Threesome. Two eggs any style, buttermilk griddle cake, choice of double smoked bacon or rosemary ham or country sausage, fresh fruit garnish. Oh my god. This pancake is amazing. It's big and thick and it's so so good. The \"fruit garnish\" is way more of a garnish in my opinion. It's a beautiful little display of sweet pineapple, grapes, strawberry, and a slice of dragon fruit. Even though dragon fruit is totally bland, it's a beautiful addition to the plate.

The only thing I don't like about OEB is that massive long table that goes down the middle of the restaurant. You have to sit on these high stools to sit at that table. It's kinda uncomfortable. However, they do have regular tables and the servers will be happy to seat you at a normal table. You may have to wait longer, though.

This place also has a liquor license so you can buy a mimosa!! I have yet to do that but I intend to the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I'd recommend the Box \"Meatless to Say\". Also download \"No Wait\" in the Apple App Store to reserve a virtual spot in line so you're not standing outside long. Great atmosphere and busy for a reason. I'll be going back during my next trip out west."}
{"text":"First breakfast in Canada... set a high bar. Soul in a Bowl was awesome with added tomato and guac. First visit to Canada."}
{"text":"If you are not or have not eaten here you are missing out. Menu is fantastic... so many options, so little time...staff is friendly and the ambiance is spectacular."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for brunch, the only issue is the line up is always way too long and hard to get a spot. Other then that the food and service are always on point"}
{"text":"Busy little Brekky joint..........nice to dine in but you'll have to wait outside most of the time.......the first time i went i had some waffles that were like dessert and was put off......no one needs that much whipped cream and sugar in the morning......but I gave it another shot and stuck with a hearty style breakfast and wasn't let down......GOLD DIGGER in a box was the way to go........perfect blend of duckfat fries and pork belly !
Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, environment was welcoming and tidy. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the food! It's better to opt for a scramble or big plate to get your money's worth here. Nutella French toast didn't have quite enough Nutella to make it worth it for me :)"}
{"text":"Group of 4 met up for breakfast on a Thursday morning.  Timed street parking around a busy area.

First impression was CUTE, very adorable space.  Seated immediately, coffee and orange juice ordered.  Coffee was refilled frequently, orange juice was overpriced.  

For breakfast I had the salmon Benedict, not the best I've ever had but a good meal.  Fresh fruit served with was yummy, pancakes my friend ordered were huge.  


Overall I would come back for seconds.  This is a very cute place to get together with your friends for breakfast or brunch.  Service 4/5...Food 4/5...Price about $20-25 per person."}
{"text":"Ooo! What a great find! Overeasy is a little hip restaurant located on Edmonton Trail just a stones throw away from downtown. My boyfriend found this place on yelp (where else?) so we went to check it out. The decor is fun and funky! The staff takes great pride in keeping a clean place too! You'll wait up to an hour on the weekend to get in but the neighbour is a good place to go for walk. 

The menu has an amazing selection: So much selection it takes us 15 minutes to make a decision but the staff are very friendly and give us the chance go through the huge selection of food. I chose the Upstream Benny (By Upstream, we mean Salmon). It was perfect. Not too much hollandaise, comes with a side of fruit and I got a side of sourdough toast and WOW! Yum! My boyfriend got the Old Fashion Omelet and he loved it!

And if you have a hate for eggs, please don't let this deter you: They have a good selection of non-eggy breakfast-awesomness: Waffles, pancakes, and crepes. 

You must go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the breakfast here, it's good, fast and inexpensive.

It usually gets crowded shortly after opening, so it's important to arrive when they open at 07:00 or to be prepared to wait a little bit.

The place isn't very large and has cozy and comfortable seating but it can be difficult to seat groups larger than four.

The wait staff are outstanding and they are quick with a coffee refill."}
{"text":"If Calgary had more places like OEB it would be a food destination! Everything I've ordered has been excellent and the staff are always great. It gets busy and is often crowded so it might be better to go on an off peak time."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to this OEB location for Sunday brunch. The wait was almost two hours but it was fine because we checked in at home and walked over when there were six groups in front of us (started of with 48!). The yelp wait List feature is awesome. When we walked in we were seated right away at the bar. We had fantastic service at the bar and our server was friendly, informative and quick. The food was SO GOOD!!! We had been to both other locations and I was very disappointed when I wasn't able to have the potatoes since they were fried in duck fat BUT at this location they have a veggie fryer! This meant I was a lot less limited with my options! We haven't been to oeb since learning about the duck fat since they don't have too many options for savoury meals but the veggie fryer changes all that! We will for sure be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to get on board with the whole brunch culture. Don't get me wrong, I love the food. But the excessive wait times because places don't take resos? Not my thing.

Testing my limits (and hanger level), we waited about 20 mins for a table. Which still boggles my mind as there were quite a few empty tables when we got seated (and weren't filled while we were there). And food came out for only two other tables besides us (yes, I was food stalking).

It must be the night club mentality they're going for:
\"Look! There's a long line up of people trying to get in! This must be a really hip and happening place, and we have to try to get in too!\" 
And you finally get inside and it's empty . . .

When we left, we noticed there were people eating at side tables scattered throughout the 5th Ave building. Why didn't we think of that?! I would have happily gotten our eggs benny and french toast to go and enjoyed them at a nearby bistro table if it meant being able to eat right away! Maybe next time . . ."}
{"text":"The silver lining of having to wake up super early to take my doggie to the groomers is getting to go for breakfast - and it made is extra happy that OEB was just down the street.

Although it was lined up out the door, it only took 15 mins for us to get in (I think it was because it just the two of us, the group of 5 ahead of us didn't get a table until we starting eating . . .)

We got seated at the big benched table in the middle (you're spaced enough from the people next to you so don't feel like you're dining with strangers) and our  waitress left us to ponder over the menu while she grabbed our drinks (chocolate milk and I got a mango smoothie - YUM!) I actually had a hard time deciding on what to get because I wanted everything! I settled on their traditional eggs benny and my BF got the Gooooooooo Bananas (french toast made with banana bread accompanied with a vanilla bean gelato)

The food was AMAZING! Very flavorful and it definitely convinced me that I need to come back and eventually try everything else OEB has to offer :)"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!!!! 
I ordered a croque Madame and wow!!! Fresh. Soft. Flavourful. Loaded with amazing. My friend ordered a breakfast bowl...it was so huge! 
Service was fast. Quick. Good. Clean. 
And busy! What a great environment. Would definitely recommend this as one of the best breakfasts in Calgary."}
{"text":"Delicious very large portions.  The food came out fast.  The coffee they Serve is excellent as well.  The Service was on point and very friendly.  If I had to say something bad, in hopes they change it, I added an avocado to dish and it was expensive."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience. My order of Tres-mon something was small portioned and costly. Thank goodness the rest of my family had larger portions for their orders. I ate their left overs and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Just went today (Thursday morning) and didn't have to wait long maybe 5-10 minutes. I love the cozy feel of this restaurant. There are booths and tables on the sides and a long communal high top table in the middle. We were seated at the high top. 

The server offered us coffee right away. There are so many things that looked good on the menu. Anyone can find something they would like. I chose the waffle blue plate special with poached eggs, chicken sausage and beautiful fresh fruit. The food came out really fast and everything on my plate was delicious! It was the best waffle I've ever had. I've come here before and ordered the soul in a bowl which is also amazing!"}
{"text":"I, like most of Calgary, am a big brunch fan and after living in Renfrew my whole life I was happy when it started becoming the breakfast joint capital of the city.

Overeasy is one of my favorites on Edmonton trail. I recently had the Soul in a Bowl in which the \"bowl\" is actually one of those cute, Chinese takeout boxes. Two poached eggs, breakfast potatoes, cheese, ham and Hollandaise turn into a beautiful \"breakfast poutine\" that made my first meal of the day, my best meal. 

Yep, lines are rough sometimes but that's the price you pay for brunch on Edmonton Trail. I remember when this used to be the last-resort \"Country Kitchen\" but with new ownership and a serious facelift it has quickly and easily stood out amongst the nearby competition."}
{"text":"Excellent. 

One of my favourite breakfast restaurants in Calgary if not my favourite. 

Can get busy at weekend and a little snug when full. 

But newly decorated bright inviting space. 

High quality food. As simple or complex as you want to go"}
{"text":"OEB is SUPER BUSY! I recommend everyone to use Yelp or NOWAIT app to get in line. I think today the Yelp app did not work, if in doubt do both! That being said, even if the app says be there at X:XX time, and when you get there you will prob. have to wait for another 15-20 min. 

The wait is long but the food is worth the wait, ordered the upstream benny, duck confit, griddle cake, and a side of double fry potato wedge. We tried their match latte and orange juice.

The smoke salmon on the upstream with the egg combo was amazing! Duck confit with the pirogies is very unique and is very savoury. The buttermilk griddle cake with maple syrup was good but was nothing special. If you love fries you must get the double fried potato wedges, very crispy and have a pretty good spice to it.

Heard they are opening up two locations in Edmonton. Look forward to try it in Edmonton."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast diner in the whole city. I always order the \"soul in the bowl\" and I'm never disappointed with their has browns. Would greatly recommend for breakfast lovers everywhere"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of oeb and it's the go-to breakfast place for me. I met up with some friends at their downtown location on a Saturday morning. Unfortunately at the time, their wait app wasn't working but luckily one of my friends made it down by 9:15 to get our name on the list. At that time it was already a 45 minute wait for a table of three. It was also super busy. In fact, I'm not sure I'd bother if I came later in the morning considering how long wait times are. When we left around 11:15, the wait was 2 hours and people who didn't know about the wait app or the normally long wait times were quite shocked. The staff were offering people to get take out and eat it at the tables upstairs of the building. We were seated just after 10am. It was my first time at the downtown location and the decor is nice and more trendy compared to the Edmonton trail location. Unfortunately for us, we were seated at bar stools in front of the window. It made for a less intimate gathering for the three of us. We would've much preferred a real table. Glancing through the menu I noticed a significant price increase now that they've expanded. Also, they've cut back on portions too. The eggs Benedict used to come with potatoes and fruit but now you have to pay extra for fruit. I find breakfast entrees close to $20 or over for breakfast to be a bit much. The server poured us coffee when we sat down but never returned to refill out cups. Major disappointment there. The lobster crepe I got was also low in the lobster department and mostly scrambled eggs with peppers. It was strangely on the sweet side too which is a bit strange considering it's a savory dish. I'm a little sad to say I wasn't terribly impressed with their breakfast or service this time around."}
{"text":"I have been to OEB two different times, once on a breakfast date and more recently bringing some out of town family for what I hoped to be an amazing breakfast. 

This place seems to excel at the sweet breakfast offerings. Both times I have ordered my classic bacon and eggs breakfast, while someone else I have dined with has gone with a sweet breakfast. These are the kinds of breakfasts that make everyone else wish they had what you're having! My goodness! The granola with warm banana bread is incredible, the presentation alone makes this thing to pretty to eat! What you end up with is a massive serving of fresh granola, yogurt, berries and warm banana bread - incredible.  The other one that I experienced major breakfast envy over was a fruit filled crepe with some sort of creamy filling - i forget exactly what the filling was but this thing was over the top as well. A delicate crepe stuffed to impossible proportions with fruit and just the right amount of creamy filling. This would be the way I wish I could get my fruit servings in every day! So, so good. 

As for the classic, bacon and eggs breakfast - it's good but it's not the best. The eggs here are amazing, dark yolks and delicious. The bread is also really nice, we had a hearty sourdough rye that was lovely but actually too heavy for me (bacon and eggs is heavy on it's own, I think I like a less substantial bread with my breakfast). The bacon was great too. The sticking point for me, and if you know me this is no surprise, was the hash browns.  I've already admitted I'm picky but these....these are more like those \"spuds\" one picks up at a Winks or something. So unexpected and not appealing at all. None of us ate very many and one of my guests didn't even have any as they concluded the same thing as me about the gas station \"spuds\" and were just turned off. If they could change this up, use good quality spuds, keep them simple with maybe some seasoning and green onion, I think they could really elevate this breakfast classic to what they are clearly capable of.  Everything else about this breakfast was spot on though!

Next time I am at this place I promise I will not choke and order my same old classic standby and I will instead order a sweet breakfast and let everyone else experience some envy! ha ha!

Review #1 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I always aim to get there early. It's a little crazy for an early morning, but the staff is also always able to keep up. The food is always fresh and tasty. My only problem is deciding what to get. Their menu is so big, but I know that no matter what I choose it'll be delish!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it felt like a completely different restaurant.  The food was just okay. I ordered an eggs benedict and it felt like it was thrown together. I've had the same dish at the downtown location and it was so much better there. Our food came out really fast so it seemed like they just wanted to rush everyone out so they could get the next party in."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Amazing.  Stupid Good.  oh hell...quit reading and just go here.  The place is one of the best breakfast joints we've EVER experienced.  The small wait in the this cozy spot is worth the wait.  We showed up and had a 45 minute wait.  My God was it worth it.  Some chefs just get it when it comes to poaching an egg or getting flavors, portions, cooking and presentation correct.  They hit it out of the park.  The service is fast, attentive and friendly.  You can tell that the staff of the restaurant enjoy their jobs and each other.  Its a positive energy great vibe in there.  Lets get back to the unbelievably good food.  I had the Salmon Benedict and my wife had some kind of Lamb bowl dish.  Both were so good we kept talking about the food for days.  I'm pissed I have to travel all the way to Calgary to get something this good and inspired, but I will.  Its a small jaunt down the street from downtown.  Get out of your hotels and try a breakfast that is as memorable is it is good.  A real treat."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Highly recommend using the no-wait app as the line on the weekends can be hours long. Their bowls are amazing."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in the city.   They raise their own chickens leading to yummy dark egg yolks.  All of the plates are good here, especially the Bennies, but the star of the show are their breakfast poutines with brown butter hollandaise and poached eggs.  The veggie version with avocado and tomato is my go-to, but they even have a to die for Foie Gras + truffle version.  Sad they took Huevos Rancheros off the menu, but I guess Calgary needs more Californians to order it.   Their OJ is some of that \"whole orange\" type with lots of zesty oils from the rind; smoothies are all tasty light brekkie alternatives. 

Licensed for those who need some hair of the dog or just like Bailey's in their coffee."}
{"text":"The breakfasts here cannot be beat. Favourites are the lotta lox.   Comes with lots of fries served in a huge bowl.  Best option if you want it a little lighter is to go half or full spinach instead of the fries."}
{"text":"I love this place!   The menu was ridiculous - I wanted to order EVERYTHING.  I finally settled on the traditional eggs benedict, which is my personal measuring stick for a breakfast place (is that irrational?)...and it was sooo good!  The eggs were made to order and perfectly done, the hollandaise sauce was great, it came with a good bit of yummy fruit (including dragon fruit!) and the potatoes were super tasty. The coffee hit the spot too.  And....the price is right!

Lastly, the service was some of the best I've had at a place like this.  Quick on the coffee, the food came 5 minutes after ordering (actually 5 minutes), and the bill was prompt.  

Seriously, this is a must-try kind of place!"}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast joint in Calgary. Their boxed breakfasts are mind blowing! Their hash browns are fried in duck fat and their apple juice is so good!"}
{"text":"what a great breakfast and server experience. fast helpful and always there for a top off of coffee and water.  wild boar shoulder with eggs over easy on an open faced toast. fresh fruit on the side too."}
{"text":"We went to the downtown location. The wait is long and the it's a little pricey but the food was fantastic. Must try place. I ordered Chasing Chicken bowl and my wife ordered the Breakfast in Tuscany and we both loved it. The bowls are a big heavy because they have fries and cheese but overall, really great taste. The service was also great as the food came within minutes of us ordering. It can be tough to get a seat on the weekend as they don't take reservations but we got there before 10am and had no problems (any later and you're looking at crazy wait times)."}
{"text":"OEB hit it out of the park!  We came on a busy Sunday to satisfy our hankering for breakfast.  Beware of the line-up... Even at 1pm on Sunday, we still waited over 45 mins for a party of 6.  Driving past, I've seen line-ups outside on weekdays as well.

OEB does its best to make the waiting tolerable.  They came out to serve coffee, as well as banana bread.  Kinda makes you enjoy waiting in line... Well, at least as much as such a thing is possible!

The menu contains all sorts of sinful breakfast delights, such as a \"soul bowl\" - a bowl full of their potatoes (fried in organic duck fat), topped with cheese curds, poached eggs and hollandaise.  Not to be outdone, the Croque Madame takes the French classic - grilled cheese/ham sandwich, covered in eggs and cheese... And tops it with hollandaise!

For those with less uh... 'hefty' appetites, most of the other typical breakfast items come with a healthy side serving of fresh fruit.  Yum!!  OEB has something for everyone, and the service is efficient yet friendly."}
{"text":"Came here thanks to Yelp and I was not disappointed. 
It is a funny little spot. Not much room and if you want to eat all alone - you can't.
You end up sitting very close to the next table and since I travel alone a lot, it is something I don't mind so much - might not be for everybody though.
It is a very busy place even on a Wednesday.
Now here comes the food part. 
OMG! It is so good. 
I had the eggs Benedict on Gluten free bread. Oh! What a treat!! The brow butter  Hollandaise Sauce was out of this world and the eggs were done to perfection. I so wished that the meal would never stop - anyway it came to an end and I reluctantly stopped myself from licking the plate. 
Two Thumbs up to this little spot. I will be back."}
{"text":"As soon as I heard that OEB opened in downtown, I jumped in for a big hearty breakfast only to be matched with over 50 people waiting outside of the restaurant to get a seat. We placed our names down, willing to wait for 1 hour and went out for some dim sum appetizers.

Once we got in, i was blessed to get a seat at the egg shaped table. I ordered Gold Digga with addtional avocado, and mushrooms with a side of coffee.

It was a heavenly experience with diner music running in the background. The food was amazing, tasty potatoes, soft texture of the egg well made. I love cracking the yolk and mixing it with the potato to give the extra dimension of texture and flavor. The unlimited coffee was also amazing and freshly brewed, i had 3 cups of it and wanted more but my stomach says \"i am drowning\".

The bill came out too strong for me but it was as expected since i ordered extra avocado and mushrooms. Please come in if you are really hungry as it was too heavy for me.

Overall, I must go back to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"The Original Soul in a Bowl is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth.  

My breakfast partner got a benny and that was also yummy...the fruit side was a great addition as it was incredibly fresh.  Service was wonderful....but the wait...oh the wait.  There were many large groups ahead of us and this made it a little painful.  Also this is a tight room, you get to listen to the tables next to you as they are almost in your lap.  Fine unless you get a crashingly boring pretentious couple with cranky \"I don't want to be at brunch\" baby on one side and hungover walk of shame girls reeking of the night before on the other.  Unless you are into that, which is personal taste.

The food was well worth the wait and ambiance though but next time I plan to get there way earlier!  And I plan to order the exact same thing every visit."}
{"text":"When people say to me \"I went to ____ and it was the best brunch in the city\" I can't help myself by replying with an \"oh yaahh? Have you been to Over Easy?\" (it's either that or \"my dad can beat up your dad\")... The usual response is \"no, I haven't\" and \"no he can't\"...

This is my favourite breakfast/brunch/lunch place in the city, and in my opinion is the BEST in the city.  How could it not be when they produce their own free run chickens specifically for their dark yolk Omega 3 eggs (sunny side up please)?! Also all of their breads are house made (english muffins are amazing) and did I mention the potatoes are cooked in 100% Organic duck fat?! Hell yes. 

The menu is awesome. Sustainable, Organic, Local and Enviro-friendly.  It's not pricey, it's priced accordingly. Quality my friends, quality. 

The staff are equally awesome. Fun, quirky girls with personality.  They match the space perfectly.  

The menu is well thought out with fun names like \"My Blind Date\", \"The One That Did Not Get Away\" and \"Soul in a Bowl\"...the biggest problem is talking yourself out of ordering something from the \"Sweet Dreams Are Made of These\" section of the menu...

Go for the \"Threesome\" - probably the most fluffy delicious pancakes I've ever had, served with bacon (or your choice of meat) and aforementioned Omega 3 dark yolk eggs (Sunny Side Up). This is my go-to.  

\"Soul in A Bowl\" - OEB's breakfast poutine complete with cheese curds, duck fat fried potatoes, bacon and two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce.  The original breakfast poutine!

Food Dreams."}
{"text":"Great experience here. Had the eggs Benedict with crab, the banana cream French toast, and the smoked salmon omelette with arugula salad. Everything was delicious. Will certainly be back soon. My only complaint is that they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"This is probably the most popular spot for brunch. There was a wait on a Monday morning, but host over estimates the time, so don't be discouraged. I tried two breakfast poutines, the chorizo meatball and the roasted pork. Both were really good, but I liked the roasted pork more. Their hollandaise sauce is amazing!! I wish I had more of it to dip my fries in. Overall, a good brunch spot and I wish I had time to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Unreal ... but you already knew that. Believe the hype. It's an unbelievable, trendsetting place."}
{"text":"Oeb is my favourite new restaurant in Calgary - Perfection. The service was great, friendly and efficient.. The Eggs Benedict Florentine was the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had - so delicious. The grapefruit juice was dicious too. The prices are reasonable, considering the quality. There is free one hour parking available, underground. This location is busy so avoid peak times if you can."}
{"text":"Deciding what to get here was totally unfair. Seriously. We looked at the menu for a few minutes before we were seated (and yes, there was a considerable wait even on a Wednesday) and this may have been the hardest decision of my life. 

I really wanted to get a breakfast poutine, but after a week and a half of travelling and eating out constantly I needed something less intense. I ordered the Farmer John's Delight - an omelette with rosemary ham, bacon, and mushrooms and it was stupid good!! The food arrived surprisingly quickly for how busy they were, and I was super glad of it! Even the fruit on the side was really fresh and tasty.

The omelette was huge, and hiding a heap of delicious potatoes beneath it. The dish also came with toast, so as you can imagine I took a bunch to go (and thoroughly enjoyed it when I got back to Vancouver!)

The atmosphere is fun and lively, and sitting at the communal table was awesome because we got to ogle everyone else's food (and have ours mutually ogled!) The decor is kitschy and the staff are friendly - definitely somewhere I'll be coming back to!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really neat and their wait list system is great. We had to wait 45 min but you could leave the area. They have very interesting breakfast ideas. I had the scrambled eggs, French toast and fruit. The eggs were so runny I sent them back. 
The waitress was not around much but another guy seemed to help us. Maybe she went on break but didn't tell us. 

It is definitely worth trying once. It's not cheap and portions aren't big but quality is good."}
{"text":"Holy Crab Benny (soft), every time. Great service and good coffee. Only downside is this place is always crowded (with good reason!) and so seating is quite crammed. Always use the App 'No Wait' so that I don't have to wait up to 2 hours to get seated."}
{"text":"We went here for a Mom's Day treat, but have to wait for about an hour still even with the Nowait app, considering it's Mother's Day, that's ok I guess. We were promptly seated in bar stools and maybe it's a bit of an offsight since we have a 5 y/o , a normal table might be better. But then again, the place is quite tight and so it's compact, these factors are the  only ones I didn't like . With the food , I ordered their classic Belgian  waffles , crispy, fresh and light, Altho I don't recall having whipped cream with it and the syrup is just enough for 1 waffle considering there's 3 waffles altogether, while my boys tried the egg menus, namely chicken frittata, soul in a bowl & wild boar ScalIa. I can say it's fresh, delectable and wonderfully mixed flavors . I tried a taste on it all and Wow! hats off! I rated 4 since with my simple waffles , I felt they didn't put much soul into it as the rest , i.e more syrup (at least home made but not watered down)a whipped cream option, and some choices on fruits on top, with a custardy finish.. I'm just thinking waffles are still best at Cora's but definitely try all the \"egg menus\" ."}
{"text":"This place has the best brunch around. It is just amazing. The only downside is that it's no secret. They are always really busy, be prepared to wait... but the wait is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Had the wild boar  spalla because I had never had wild boar before. It is always good to expand the list of animals I have eaten. It was really good.  The wild boar was like prosciutto and went well with the brioche and eggs. Service was quick and friendly.  Is not a large place and fills up quickly so come early"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a genuinely fantastic breakfast place in calgary.....but OEB is the best I've come across yet!  Great food,  nice staff, quaint atmosphere! 

The menu there is second to none, and the quality of the food is off the charts.  I had the Canadian Eggs Benny and it was honestly probably the best eggs Benedict I have ever had.  The Canadian bacon was flavourful,  the hollandaise was creamy deliciousness and the duck fat fries were amazballs.

The menu has definitely got major variety ranging from classics breakfast such as eggs,bacon,ham and ranging to waffles pancakes, breakfast bowls and a lot of other things that I don't even know... 
until I looked them up on Google!

I would LOVE to have the opportunity to try everything on the menu,  but unfortunately  that will never happen, which leads me to my only complaint about OEB....the line ups!!!!

There is seating for maybe 30 people in the restaurant,  so there is always going to be a major wait to get a table.  Good problem as a business operator, bad problem as a customer!  If you want to get breakfast on the weekend you can basically forget about it, as you will have to wait forever,  and no matter how good the food is,  nothing is worth waiting over an hour for.

Love the food, hate the wait!  If you're gonna try it, I recommend going if you have a day off during the week at around 11 and it won't be as crazy busy!"}
{"text":"Most people who know me are aware of the fact that I'm a brunch aficionado. I've frequented many brunch places both in Vancouver and Calgary and OEB is by far my favourite! The hollandaise sauce here is amazing. My ultimate favourite dish here is the Gold Digga - poached eggs, twice fried potatoes cooked in organic duck fat, cheese curds, roast pork, black truffles and brown butter hollandaise. It's almost like a super decadent breakfast poutine. My boyfriend likes this dish too but sometimes says its too much potato to consume in one sitting. Their eggs benedicts are really good as well! My favourite is the Upstream eggs benedict, which consists of Ocean Wise smoked salmon and sautéed spinach. 

Because there's a consistent wait at OEB, they use an app called \"NoWait\" where you can put yourself on the waitlist so that by the time you arrive, your table is just about ready! I believe they only hold your table for about 5 minutes or so though, so it's really a timing thing.

They have a little takeout order window as well, for those who don't want to wait for a table. There's many tables and seating throughout the building that the restaurant is in for those who want to have the food but can't afford to wait that long. 

Minus one star for not really being a place you can spontaneously decide to go to (due to the wait) and being on the pricier side. This place is still my fave though! 

Verdict:

Service - 4.5/5 (The staff here have been really nice every time I've been here!)
Atmosphere - 4.5/5 
Food - 5/5 
Would I return: definitely!"}
{"text":"So long as you are prepared to wait the long line to get in, this place is worth every minute of it. Pleasant staff and truly spectacular food. Just a simple breakfast joint, this is not. I had the Confit de Cunard. OMG one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I will be back"}
{"text":"Went here this morning for breakfast before heading back to Edmonton. I'm still thinking about my breakfast... it was that amazing. 

I had the Croque Madame - prosciutto between slices of brioche with an amazing brown butter hollandaise and sunny side up eggs on top. 

We aren't in Calgary too often but I will definitely need to go back here. One of the best things I've eaten in quite a while. 

It is a small joint and I assume it gets packed on weekends but we only waited a couple minutes (Stampede time so that was pretty good)."}
{"text":"So good... friends took us here on our weekend stay in Calgary. They recommended the Soul Bowls and they were fantastic. I had the one with the Spolumbos chorizo meatballs, it was awesome. The hash browns are cooked in duck fat and are amazing. Everyone else loves their meals too (there were 5 of us). They lose a point for the insane wait times. We made a table check in at 10 AM, were given a time for noon, and still waited another 45 minutes. We were in no rush so no big deal, but if I had been overly hungry or in a rush this would have been a huge issue."}
{"text":"Loved it!  make sure to get a reservation, without one expect long wait times to get in, but it's soo worth it! We some service amazing food."}
{"text":"One of my go to breakfast place.im absolutely inlove with the duck confitt with perogies.its a must try dish. Also the staff are very friendly. A little downside is,theres not much table and all the tables are packed together.however,the food is outstanding! The long line up is totally worth it"}
{"text":"Very good drinks and egg benedicts. You have to come early as the restaurant is usually very full. One of the beat breakfast places. The ambience is top notch"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for bruch. never disappoint me with their waffles and Benedict."}
{"text":"This place should be a five star, I am just not happy with how long it took to get in. I waited for an hour after being told \"15 minutes\", \"just another 10 minutes\", \"10 more minutes\". This happened to me and about 10 other groups. Such a good breakfast spot, just so busy and they need to get a better handle on the wait list."}
{"text":"Love OEB!  Food is great, service is great...I don't mind waiting in line, but we try to get there as early as possible to avoid it."}
{"text":"Finally got got try OEB and wow! I can't wait to come back! I had the Holy Crab Benny and it was the best Benny I've had. My only thing I can say negative about it was my eggs were overcooked. I asked for soft and they were more medium to hard. 

My daughter had the waffle. Just a simple waffle, but it was so good. 

Be prepared to pay for all the extras (quite a bit) i.e. Hollandaise, whipped cream, but so worth the breakfast!

My new favourite spot."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast place in the city.  Coffee is awesome, love the blue plate specials, and worth the wait everytime!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day , it's more exciting when you're planning a trip to OEB. I highly suggest using the No Wait App, it's a game changer and definitely a great away to avoid being hangry. 

The decor of this restaurant is well thought out and everything is super cute. We were so happy that we got to sit in a large egg with the egg yolk as our table. 

Besides the adorable aesthetics, the food and service was amazing. These were the items that I tried : 

Ehhhh Itza Meatball $15.99 - super savoury and you can never go wrong with cheese curds. 

Crispy Belgium Waffle $15 with berries - perfectly made 

Hog & Scallop $19.20 - this one is limited, if you love perfectly cooked large scallops, order this one ASAP 

Chunky Lobster Scramble $19.20 - comes with large chunks of lobster


I can't wait til Edmonton opens their very own OEB :)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Ingredients are always fresh and of good quality. So many choices on their menu, you really can't go wrong with anything. To me, the star of the show is their potatoes which are seasoned and fried perfectly. Also, it's hard to believe that they're able to deliver your food within 10 minutes of ordering and because of that, they're able to turnover their tables pretty fast. Which is a good thing because the wait for a table is pretty long. But as I wrote in a tip, if you download the No Wait app you can check how long the wait is and can put your name down in the queue. The app tells you how many parties in front of you so you can gauge when to head over to the restaurant. Seriously, such a time saver!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! It's a little expensive, but  it's justified when you see the quantity of food given.

The potatoes are to die for!! Super crispy and flavourful. They don't have too many vegetarian options, but the limited options they have are pretty good. 

Only downside, it's usually crowded. I had to wait 45 minutes for a table, and it was a Wednesday morning!! Pretty crazy. 

All in all, really great food, nice establishment and modern decor. 10/10"}
{"text":"OEB is awesome - there's a reason the wait list is 2.5 hours long on weekends! The menu is incredible though - so many options that you won't find in the many other brunch hotspots around Calgary. Fresh fruit on the side is fresh and different as well."}
{"text":"Staff is always kind and the food is consistently good.  Its usually quite busy and the wait is long but if you have the noWait app and throw your name on there its easy to get in.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the food here, always tastes great, creative and visually pleasing. The food came out FAST last time too. Would love if this place was a bit closer to home for me :p and if the line ups weren't so long... hehe"}
{"text":"I wish you had fois grois again

I also wish I could spell that properly, or say it properly"}
{"text":"The food is incredible and truly represents all that brunch can be. From the eggs benny and beyond, this place really makes you feel like you are NOT eating at grandma's table.
The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because these guys just need to decide and make the whole experience better for the customer. It takes WAY too long to have lunch there. We've waited 2 hours before we were served. C'mon, just lease the rest of the space and make some decent seating already!"}
{"text":"What an eggcellent place! (did you *seriously* expect me to pass that one up?!??!).

I met up with a group of people here yesterday morning and was very, very happy to have had this place introduced to me.

They've got palate pleasing food (everything from burgers, pasta and crepes, to waffles, french toast and pancakes.

The staff is super friendly and the prices are extremely reasonable especially for the quality of food that they serve. Everything is fresh and locally grown.

Plus they have coffee that puts Starbucks to shame! Soooo. Friggin. Good.

If you wake up starving like I do, then there's only one solution for you: Head to Overeasy and let the good people of this place take care of you."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! We were there for lunch on a Friday and it was packed. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated and we got to sit by the kitchen. The vibe is great and the kitchen is open concept and you can see them prepare your food as if you're at home. The service was quick and the food quality is the best part. The fruits were fresh and the flavours and the preparation was beautiful. I would go back but since I'm based out of Vancouver I will have to wait for them to open a branch here. Apparently they are to coming Vancouver next year; I can't wait!!!

Here's my VLOG of OEB.

{"text":"This only gets 4 stars because it's in Calgary and I don't live there. (This makes me sad). It turns out there are 2, so for a fun Sunday event meet a family member there, but to make it interesting, each end up at a different location and wait for each other...anyhoo. Once I got to the correct location and found my niece things got better. The menu is huge, so besides the previous misadventure, the worst part was trying to make a decision. Everything was fantastic, fresh and abundant. The coffee was great as was the service. I ordered avocado for my sandwich and they brought me a whole one sliced beautifully. You won't go hungry here, and there's so much great stuff on the menu, you'll have several reasons to return again and again...just make sure you're at the right one. 

P.S. The other guests seem very open to discuss what their eating if you're having a hard time making a decision."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the positives: the food here is amazing. It's good quality and to die for. There is pretty much no wait for the food, time it when you go. From time of ordering to service, it was 7 minutes till I had my meal. Sure it's only eggs but the food arrived before the juice did. Always a good thing when you're hungry, which you likely will be because you've been waiting 2 hours to get in.

Everything else is basically a negative:
They do use the Nowait app which can be handy for getting in line while you're still at home. I've used it on a not so busy day and the wait was 30 mins, I was texted in 15 that my table was ready. I sure wasn't as I was still at home. On a busy weekend, during brunch hours, I've been told an hour and showed up exactly an hour in but it was still another 30 min wait.

There is absolutely NO seating area (or standing) when you show up for your reservation. The doorway is jammed and the servers are frantically trying to get through. The hostess will snap at you to get out of the way as you're blocking the menu/coffee/pay station but that is because there is no where else to go. This is a huge problem when the weather isn't nice outside because everyone is pushing in to stay warm. Also sucks for those sitting near the doorway, hope you like strangers rubbing up against you. 

The service is not good. Not because the servers are bad but this company is trying to jam as many customers in as humanly possible and the servers are literally run ragged. I completely understand why they are impatient and forgetful but I'm also not here to be treated poorly. They need to hire more staff for the weekend shifts. 

Overall the food is great but the atmosphere feels like you're in a Denny's right after church service has ended. No thanks OEB, I'd rather have a relaxed brunch somewhere else than being jammed into tables so small I feel like cattle being herded to the feedlot."}
{"text":"There's a reason why there is always a line up outside OEB. The food is unique, delicious, and flavourful."}
{"text":"Best breakfast of my life. The Benny's are to die for. Long line ups, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"waits long time. Make sure you reserve it first. Ordered corque Madame, duck confit. Served with fruits"}
{"text":"The \"Soul N' a Bowl\" is a must-try. 

It's kind of like poutine, but with herb fries, and with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce on top."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Over Easy Breakfast a week or so ago and I forgot to review but that isn't because it was unforgettable - quite the contrary! (I've just been a little busy lol)

When we arrived we were so happy to see NO lineup! (as there usually is one when we pass by) Everything was great from the server to my frothy cappuccino the only thing I wasn't overly thrilled about was the fact that there were items fried in duck fat. I wish there was an alternative! Other than that we enjoyed ourselves and left quite full!

Great choice for any breakfast lover ;)"}
{"text":"I brought myself here for breakfast after reading all the great Yelp reviews. If anything they understate it. A really cute place in a nondescript neighborhood does magical things with eggs potatoes and meat. The portions are huge you could easily share one between two or three people."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience to try a true Canadian dish- breakfast poutine with a poached egg! AMAZING Hollandaise sauce and crispy potato fries. I tried the Soul Bowl (had yummy crispy bacon bits in it) and then did it half spinach, half fries as recommended by the server who said it is a heavy dish with just the potatoes. Also added avo on top (Fiance & I split one, he got the Lobster bowl which he loved). Service was pretty quick around us but our server seemed a bit distracted compared to the rest. Would love to try another dish when back in town!"}
{"text":"This has become my favourite breakfast spot in town.

The first time I had been, I waited in line and sat at the long table in the middle. I perused the menu but knew I wanted to go with the Soul in a Bowl. Holy cow, the dish knocked my tastebuds out of the table. It was comfort food in the most delicious possible combination imaginable. Potato wedges, egg, chicken sausage, cheese curds.. oh my! I could not finish it by myself so took the rest to go, which was super easy because it already came in the most adorable little chinese take-out style box!

Fast forward a few months and I am back there with my mom for breakfast. Waited in line again (not my favourite, but I'll deal.. only because it's OEB) while we were offered coffee, etc. This time we sat at a table on the side, and I ordered the vegetarian eggs benny, and my mom ordered this cod and egg scramble, topped with kelp caviar. We were both SO impressed with our dishes! My eggs benny's eggs sat on roasted tomatoes, peppers, artichoke, and had no hollandaise sauce on it, but instead had a boutique olive oil. Phenomenal.

OEB claims they have their own flock of chickens running around happy and laying eggs all day. This gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling and much of this love I have for OEB comes from that. 

Their menu is extensive, and I think each item is well thought out, and terrifically well-prepared. I have never had a bad item from here. All in all, this place deserves the long lineups outside its doors every weekend, even though that is the only thing that keeps me from coming back on a weekly basis!


Review #23 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"I love this place and I want to love it more, but it doesn't fit our lifestyle with difficult parking issues and the long waits. Otherwise, their breakfasts are the bomb. Leave the toddlers at home and go brunch with friends."}
{"text":"Cash only. Great breakfast, although heavy. Sunday brunch will probably mean Sunday chill-home-and-do-nothing-else."}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to write a review as I don't want this place to get anymore crowded. But the fries got me shouting from the rooftops. Hot damn there're the best, really."}
{"text":"I was up in Calgary for a convention and wanted to try something different.  The venue   is small but the staff was great bringing coffee to those of us waiting outside.  Tried the Soul in a Bowl which is not to be missed.  If your ever in the area, I would make it a mission to drop by for breakfast."}
{"text":"breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Highly recommend breakfast on a daily basis. Brunch is also good."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been to in a while. It was so good we came here twice in our short trip to Banff. We came on a Thursday morning at 7:30 and there were very little people. By 9 is when the rush comes, expect a 30-45min wait. Even an hour.

I ordered the duck confit breakfast box which is essentially a breakfast poutine with duck confit, potatoes, a poached egg, some sort of jam and brown butter hollandaise. It was GREAT. And super filling. It came in a Chinese takeout box which is very creative. Easy to pack up if you have leftovers. The only downfall to this concept is mixing everything together. It's kind of hard to mix in the potatos at the bottom. But, that's the least of my worry. 

My friend got the crab cake benedict with no hollandaise since she can't have dairy. She was very pleased with it. Our waitress was very informative and considerate of my friends lactose intolerance. 

On our second visit, we came on Monday at 9:30am and we had to wait about 30-45 minutes. It was only a 30 min wait and we got seated. I had the duck confit perogies with a sunny side up egg. This was equally as good but a bit too much vinegar for me, however, I still enjoyed it. My friend got the scallop box. 

Some things to note:

- Menu is very creative and carefully thought out. Everything is made well
- It's VERY small inside. Go on an off time or be prepared to wait
- It's cash or debit only. You pay up at the register
- Parking is available nearby, you just have to pay

I loved this place and I wish there was a location in Chicago."}
{"text":"This is the newer downtown location; I just added it to Yelp as I'm an out of town'er staying downtown and was searching for a great breakfast. Luckily I walked by the night prior.

Anyway, phenomenal breakfast, great coffee and amazing service! The wait was long, but well worth it!

Will come back next time I'm in town.

Thanks for an amazing bday breakfast!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast food. I hate waking up in the morning for anything on my days off, but I'd get up early just to go to this place. Food is always delicious, the interior is cramped, but cozy if a bit hipster, but the place is always busy. And because it's always busy it's always loud.

They've since included themselves on the \"No Wait\" app, so you can \"line up\" digitally through the app. I was used to waiting ~30-45min for a table, so I thought I would do the same one Saturday. They quoted me a three hour wait time without the app. It's supposedly not so bad on weekdays, but I work weekdays so that's just not possible. I ended up going down the street for breakfast, had to wait there, ate and finished my meal, and was home by the time my number came up. I suppose it says something about the place if it's that packed all the time, but I'm not for that much waiting, and I'm not for using an app just to get seated.

If you love breakfast, and you don't mind needing an app to get a table, then super go for it."}
{"text":"Great environment and great service. And of course awesome food. I had holy crab and the yogurt with Poutine. All delicious.

The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the waiter who checked me in said since I was only myself there's no need to put my name down, the next available spot will take 5 mins. He would remember my face. But of course he didn't. Could not blame him. That was a very busy Sunday. But I waited for about 25 mins with a super heavy backpack. Watching people came after me got seated. But like I said, I understand. And things like these happens."}
{"text":"Good for a quick brunch. Avoid the lines using the app to get in the waiting list. Food is good, rich flavours and the menu has a lot of variety."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to go here for such a long time, it's obviously little difficult due to the long lines, but it is well worth it if you plan ahead, and make reservations in advance, as we did today, the wait time is only 5-10min. 

It goes without saying that the place was buzzing!There is a good ratio of waitresses to guests so you never felt neglected. 

The food was amazing as we expected. The entire experience made us decide that we will definitely go back again. A must try for anyone that craves great breakfast/brunch in YYC.

{"text":"Love love love this place!! I came here for a
Family brunch and had the best time. The service was impeccable and the host was incredible. We had tried to use the No Wait app but it wasn't registering so when we arrived, we let them know that the app wasn't working for us and they squeezed us in anyway. 

There are individual tables as well as communal tables with an open style kitchen. I love that the place was well lit and that some of the larger tables were enclosed in \"eggs\". The atmosphere, albeit bustling, was still very cozy and you could tell that everyone was having a good time. My dad ordered the waffles and my sister and I both had a Benny. Everything came with a side plate of fresh fruits some of which were quite exotic like dragon fruit! Mmm! 

Overall, it was well worth the wait because the food was just delightful -- big portion sizes, full of flavour and the service was top notch! Everything we had ordered was delicious -- I wouldn't even be able to tell you which one I liked the best. So go ahead, and indulge."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite breakfast joints in town. Soul in a Bowl. That is all."}
{"text":"One of Calgary's Breakfast gems!
I recently went to this location for a working breakfast. The restaurant it's self is quite small,I can see if you went on a weekend or a holiday that you will be waiting for a LONG time for a table, but I went on a Thursday morning and it was busy but we got a table right away. 

They have a very large menu for such a little restaurant, it took a good 10 minutes to read the whole thing and make a very difficult decision. The menu prominently features these breakfast bowls with different proteins, veggies and eggs served over potatoes with hollandaise sauce. A friend of mine said the those were her favourites and they will swap out half the potatoes for spinach if you ask, to make it slightly more healthy. I am not a hollandaise sauce fan so i went with the Double Trouble, which was an open faced sandwich with bacon, eggs, and cheese, chipotle aioli and  topped with arugula and manchego cheese. It was absolutely amazing, from the thick bread base to the protein heavy middle with the bitter taste of the arugula and the saltiness of the manchego to top it all off. All the flavours complemented each other well and the portion was out of this world. I tried so hard to finish but was unable to get the last few bites in, I even had to take the amazing fresh fruit to go with me to eat later (the fresh fruit was apple, pineapple, dragon fruit, and kiwi, which I consider fancy fruits!). Another person in our party ordered a smoked salmon omelette with fresh fruit which he also received the fancy fruits and a very large piece of smoked salmon. He said the breakfast was very good as well. 

The service was fast, friendly and efficent. We got our food quickly and although this was supposed to be a working breakfast, not a lot of work got done, it was actually a silent meal of people savouring awesome food. 

I would definitely recommend trying this place out. I can't wait take out-of-towners here to represent Calgary's awesome eateries or coming here with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I thought I've had some great breakfasts before I visited OEB but my experience at OEB easily topped any breakfast/brunch experience I've ever had. Everything I had there was top notch. I had the latte, the Soul in a bowl (breakfast poutine which was one of the best savoury dishes I've had and by far the best savoury breakfast dish I've had) and the Nutella french toast (I absolutely loved that it was paired with marshmallow fluff and the hint of orange blossom spice was a great contrast to the sweetness of the dish. High quality food made from high quality ingredients! Can't wait to be back in Calgary and have breakfast here everyday."}
{"text":"So OEB now has a waitlist app. This doesn't mean you still dont have to get up in time to add yourself to the waitlist so you can eat when you get hungry.

Being super paranoid, I was up at 8am, and every 30min there after to check on wait times. At 9:30am the wait was 58-83min - perfect as we wanted to eat at 10:30am. When I looked again 10min later the wait had jumped to 120-150min! Man people in this city love their brunch.

Their DT location is really open and warm. Decor is great and love the laminated menus. The menu selection is unreal too. Some pretty fancy options and really good staples.

Coffee is served in bigger mugs, not thimble cups. Great cause you aren't always looking for a server and pretty sure they are getting more done than refilling coffee cups 800 times.

Girlfriend had the eggs and waffle breakfast. Waffle came crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, cream and syrup on the side. I am not a fan of waffles but I helped her eat a 1/4 of it, it was that good. Portion came with a choice of protein and eggs. She went with scrambled and ham. Enjoyed every bite.

Her guy had the Confit Duck & Eggs. 2 poached eggs with confit duck over 4 perogies. He was surprised on the perogies (didn't read the full description) but loved the combo. He was finished first and said that it was just a little bit less than he wanted and was still slightly hungry. Out of all 4 portions this was definitely the smallest. Would have been great with even 1x side of toast or 2 more perogies.

The boy had Wild Boar Spalla (spalla? toast? something like that?). Basically 2 giant pieces of brioche toast with a ton of thinly sliced wild boar on top, mountain of arugula and 2x eggs. He loved every bite. We loved all the bites he gave us. There was so much, that he eventually gave up on the last 1/2 piece of toast and ate the wild boar off of it. Really tasty dish. All agreed it would be amazing to have the duck confit the same way.

I had the Gold Digger bowl. This thing is huge! Our server asked if I would like it 1/2 spinach as the potatoes can be too much - great suggestion and made the meal. 2 poached eggs on top of a pile of hashbrowns and spinach for days. Good sixes pieces of crispy pork belly that were all more meat than fat. I ended up sharing the last part of the bowl with my girlfriends guy as it was just too much food for me.

Service was good and efficient. Greta recommendations from the server and that can really make all the difference. Loved that once we had checked in on arrival the host let us know where we were in line - nice touch.

Will absolutely be back to try one of the other options available."}
{"text":"We live close to this place, and always see massive line-ups on weekend mornings. What, we mused, could be SO good for breakfast that so many people are willing to stand in line for so long to get it? 

Well, we finally tried it, and all those people in line sure are not wrong! This place is freakin' awesome. The small restaurant has a fun and lively atmosphere, with friendly, quick service. And the menu.... oh my the menu. It is HUGE! Lots and lots to choose from, including items featuring pork belly, foie gras, and lots more delectable ingredients. Several of the meals come in a fun take-out style container - including the one Cole ordered, 'Soul in a Bowl'. It was delish, but a bit rich. Hence, the take-out container worked perfectly when he couldn't finish! It was just as delish re-heated later in the day! 

I tried the 'Canadian, Eh\" eggs benny - which comes with pea meal bacon - yum! I also had a tasty and fresh berry smoothie. Oh, and did I mention the duck-fat cooked potato wedges? Cause they were great. 

My only 'complaint' about OEB is that the chairs at the long centre table did not have backs - something I really like on my chairs. BUT, otherwise the place was outstanding!! Great food, solid service, nice atmosphere! Can't wait to go back and try another of the 87254 things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I met my accountant here for breakfast one morning and it was an amazing experience. I loved the selection of dishes that were available as well as the bottomless coffee. The Decor and staff were also pleasing."}
{"text":"OEB is great at all their other locations and now Mission finally has a great breakfast spot. What's not to love?? The space is bigger, food is still the same delicious quality and it's within walking distance to me now. :)"}
{"text":"I love the soul in the bowl and it is my go to. It's has always been delicious and never fails to impress. I also love how you can get a basket of eggs!"}
{"text":"Do not be deterred from the long wait, download the app called \"Nowait\" and it'll put you in line and you can receive accurate wait times. The atmosphere is chaotic, but modern and chic. I love the chalk art drawings they have in the ceilings. The place has a 2000s meets a 70s authentic diner with a sense of nostalgia. The food portions are large, so come with an empty stomach. The menu is beyond overwhelming, but they cater to everyone and anyone with any specific needs (I'm vegetarian). I can't say too much for the menu because the multiple creations they have will leave you wanting to try many items. I love the customer service, and this is then perfect \"anything\" place. The staff works as a team and even if people aren't assigned to your table, they will check in on you. One of the premier places to cross off your breakfast/brunch spots here in Calgary."}
{"text":"OEB is an experience. An experience you need to have if you come to Calgary! 

Walking up to this downtown location you'll spot the bright colors of the dining room through the large windows that face the street. Lively and upbeat music is playing, crisp white and egg yolk yellow colored booths in the shape of waffles and eggs stand tall and whimsical, a bustling kitchen with cooks who look like they could burst into song at any moment, and a service team with some of the most inordinately large smiles I've seen dance around the dining room. Imagine a scene out of a movie made in partnership between Disney and the makers of Pee Wee's Playhouse, and you'll catch my drift. 

What stood out to me right off the bat though, was the LARGE menu featuring a ton of locally sourced goodies including pork from Alberta used to make house-cured bacon and sausages, duck sourced from a nearby province, and more! 

Looking at the photos, their Boxes (or bowls if enjoyed at the restaurant) are all the rage. Think breakfast poutines made with a base of herby potatotes twice fried in duck fat topped with perfectly poached eggs, brown butter hollandaise, and other  assorted condiments like house-cured bacon lardons, duck confit, and pork belly! 

Pro-Tip: All the boxes come with the potatoes even if it's not listed as an ingredient.  

I went with the \"Gold Digga\" which had roasted pork belly and black truffle in addition to the eggs and potatoes. It arrived in all its glory with two perfectly poached eggs on top under a blanket of creamy hollandaise. The pork belly was a real nice upgrade cut into thick cubes that were nicely rendered. Fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with a real herbaceous seasoning and that was a bit overwhelming. That said the fry on em really let them stand up to the holandaise. The dish was so hot that the cheese curds had mostly melted upon arrival. Sadly I did not get to taste the squeak my Canadian friends rave about. 

All that said, I think I ordered the wrong dish for me. 
The menu is clearly chef-driven (there's rabbit mortadella on the menu and sous vide confit!), and I think while these boxes are surely inspired, if you were to go with one of the more culinarily inspired choices like the duck confit box, wild boar spalla, or duck & egg, I bet you'd have a home run. 

OEB is a real experience and it's a lot of fun. There was so much goodness on the menu I was sad that I dined solo! The service by Jillian was awesome though, and I really had a nice time sitting in the window and people watching the downtown streets of Calgary."}
{"text":"Passed by Calgary on my way to Banff, went in alone to this place for brunch on Sunday morning. There were 20 groups before me on 9:30am! I waited roughly for an hour, but it was totally worth it. I ordered Benny upstream (smoke salmon) and griddle cake (aka. Pancake), it was A LOT for just me. The Benedict came with fries and fruit, very nice presentation of the plate. I Really like the their sauce for the Benedict, creamy but does not feel greasy after you ate the whole plate. But for same reason, the dish wasn't as warm (prob the spinach and English muffin was already made on the side). Griddle cake was crispy outside and fluffy inside, it went perfectly with whipped butter and syrup (a good size to share). Waitress is very friendly, and refill my coffee fast. However, I finished all, I came out happy and fulfilled."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Calgary and came across OEB by chance.  We were staying downtown and did not feel like eating the free buffet breakfast for being Gold Status members at our hotel, so we ventured out to try a favorite morning spot for many.  

We got there a few minutes before the restaurant opened and were lucky to miss the long line.  From beginning to end, our waiter Hemy made our experience wonderful.  He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and his recommendations were spot on.  I tried the Hog & Scallops with added tomatoes and my wife tried the  Menage a Tois pancakes, sausage, and eggs.

The food came out perfect.  Scallops were a perfect medium rare and was nicely balanced by the bacon, crisp potatoes, and soft poached egg.  The pancakes were fluffy and went great with maple syrup, whipped cream, and fresh strawberries.  Coffee and fresh squeezed OJ was delicious as well.

We loved this place and will make a trip back to Calgary just to experience OEB again!"}
{"text":"A breakfast/Brunch Restaurant that could easily be transported to NYC and be among the best places here as well.  Its a small place, so either go during off peak times or be prepared to wait in line. We went there twice for breakfast when we were in Calgary. The Belgian waffle was as light as air, the strawberries fresh. I had Confit Duck and Egg the other day, and it was superb, the duck egg yolk acting like a sauce when you order it sunny side up."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my scramble buckwheat crepe and pancake. Had to persevere to get a table around 2 on a Saturday, as the host initially turned away my friend, but it was worth it. Service was solid until the end when a busser tossed the rest of my friends bowl, which he intended to take away, but maybe he should have been more clear. All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"This place used to be spectacular.  don't get me wrong, the food is still really good.  But something has happened with the wait staff and especially the dork at the front who uses the iPad for reservations.  Guy must be really unhappy or something because his attitude is terrible.  So sorry we're here to try and support your business.  

Went to Reds in Ramsay instead, staff was awesome!  Sorry OEB, your losing it.  I'm out."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for breakfast this morning.  Let me preface this by saying that I give out five star ratings more sparingly since learning what very high quality food tastes like vis-a-vis Andre's in Vegas, (see my review on that if you are ever down there)  This however is up to par.  Their potatoes are cooked in duck fat, so they are not always the most vegetarian friendly, but they have options to keep vegetarians like my fiancé happy.  She had a truffled squash Benedict.  They shaved real black truffle (as opposed to Chinese truffles that are sometimes passed off as black truffles,) into her squash, and she very much enjoyed it.  I had a Gold Digga box that also had a lot of truffle shavings in it, along with pork belly, home fries that taste like confit, (by the way, they also have duck confit, or properly, confit de canard. as they are fried in duck fat ergo extra delicious.  There was also an interesting and flavourful cheese, the name of which unfortunately slips my mind.  The portions are fairly large, so go there hungry.  I was glad it all came in a box, so I could just pack it up and go home.  Also, the fruit plate had some very fresh fruit, even a dragon fruit.  This is certainly not standard breakfast fare.  This might just be the best breakfast I've ever had."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place. The food was awesome, as well as the service/decor. I would like to come here again soon."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is one of my favorite meals of the week.  I decided to eat at OEB Breakfast Company--not just because of their outstanding yelp reviews, but because I could get on the waitlist (which was 51 mins) via yelp.  I finished packing and walked over to breakfast heaven.  Omg y'all, my breakfast was SOOO good.  Breakfast poutine, who knew?  After wrestling with the menu I went with on of their signature breakfast poutines, the Gold Digga. Poached eggs (medium), herb potatoes, Quebec cheese curds, Berkshire roast pork (cube thick super bacon type bits of yum!), Black Truffles, & hollandaise. With the suggestion of my server Sylvia, I modified it a bit and \"lightened it up\" with half arugula and added avocado (the menu suggests spinach but you can do arugula instead). The flavor profile is amazing.  I got a side of bacon, well, because I love bacon, but I didn't need it.  They have some interesting inside decor (artsy egg booths) but I got a lovely bar seat at the back window with a view of that cool looking building.  #foodie #yummy #poutine #canada"}
{"text":"One word - amazing. Says it all. Great staff, food is insane, cool atmosphere. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love bunch? Everyone does I'm sure and everyone should go check out OEB (Over Easy Breakfast) on Edmonton Trail. For anyone who's lived in Calgary a long time, this is where the old Country Kitchen used to be. It's a tiny, obscure place and totally kick-ass. 

First of all, take note that OEB doesn't take reservations. But hey, no worries. You can wait outside and the lovely staff will offer you a cup of hot coffee and even a slice of banana bread. Ok, how come more places don't give me coffee & banana bread while I wait in line? (suggestion for Walmart perhaps??) This certainly makes the wait much more enjoyable. There was a table ready for our group which was supposed to be 9 but since there were only 2 of us here this Sunday morning, we waited for more of our group to show up. The staff here is so accommodating. They really deserve 5 stars for all their effort and for the friendly service. When's the last time your waitress actually said she hopes you enjoy your day and meant it? Once our group arrived, we were seated and offered beverages.

Inside, the decor is bright, but not blind-my-eyes-bright. The ceiling is a giant chalk board with all kinds of cool sayings on it. Yes, go ahead a look up. They have this high bar table that's long and has bar stools around it. They often seat larger groups there (not us today). They have little hooks under the table that the gals (or guys) can hang their purse on. What a great idea! I love the hanging lights over the high bar that have little holes poked in them that spell out the words over easy breakfast. Very cool. There's a warm feeling inside OEB with some good energy all around.

Time to order! Too many choices but I did pick just one: eggs benedict with organic spinach, comes with fresh fruit and their seasoned potatoes. Our meal came out pretty quick. No more growling tummies. Everything looked so good. You could tell that these were farm fresh eggs from the color of the yolk. And they came out just perfect, runny enough for me. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic. The English muffins underneath were a bit tough and it took a little extra effort to cut them but still, very very tasty. I love brunch and OEB has such an extensive menu, I sure want to come back and sample some more. And next time, I'm going to have a cappuccino because Crystal said it was one of the best she's had. The prices aren't cheap but the food here is so fresh & tasty and the staff is super-duper. It really is worth a visit."}
{"text":"In town for work and only had Yelp to rely on types breakfast and sorted by most reviews and looked for highest rating. This OEB earns its stars! Wild Boar is awesome. Glad I'm not local I'd be fatter than I already am."}
{"text":"We had decided to check this place out the day before so Sunday morning at about 10:00 I thought I would make sure to see how the line-up was looking on the No-Wait app. 52 parties ahead of us, 140-180 minute wait so I got in line immediately. We didn't get there until noon, and then waited until 1:30 until we were finally seated. I do feel bad for the hostess team as they are really doing their best to make sure people get in but I was quite frustrated as parties of two were always getting seated ahead of us that it made it much more difficult to arrange a table for our party of 6. The last hour the app didn't budge from 20 parties ahead of us so I feel like there has to be some bugs worked out on their end because that's simply not working correctly because it works excellent at Red's Diner. I'm giving a mediocre rating because a 1.5 hr wait on top of using the app 2 hours ahead of time simply does not make sense. Also a $12 caesar seems a bit over-priced. What I do like as a person from a farm family is they definitely take their ingredient sourcing seriously with a pretty cool wall dedicated to listing the farms they work with, and the food is definitely unreal. Well done on the new location OEB."}
{"text":"Completely worth the wait! I've never had a bad experience at either location and would recommend OEB to any breakfast lover."}
{"text":"This our regular breakfast joint whenever my boyfriend and I venture to Calgary for the weekend from Edmonton.  The wait is long, sure. But the food more than makes up for it! My boyfriend always orderes the Gold Digga box - which is perfectly and decadently loaded with duck-fat laden potatoes, hollandaise sauce, a oooey gooey egg and tender succulent morsels of pork belly cooked to perfection! It's a heart-attack in a box, but so worth the calories. I on the other hand, ordered the \"threesome\" yesterday and it was delightful. The threesome came with your style of egg, your choice of meat (i chose the double smoked bacon) and a huge buttermilk pancake with a side of fruit. I polished the entire plate off!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I will love this place till my dying day, do I need to say more? I have loved it since before it was hugely popular and I have waited 45 minutes in the freezing cold to eat here and will do it again and again. I have seriously considered licking my plate in front of people here on multiple occasions...."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in awhile. Amazing flavors with their plates. Good range of basics and cool twists. Adorable space too- put your name down before you come so you wait even less!"}
{"text":"OEB is usually my preferred breakfast spot in Calgary, when up and out early on a Sat morning. If you're not there early, you better be prepared to wait for a table, at this popular Calgary breakfast spot.

Today, being in the area and figuring the breakfast rush was over, I stopped in just after 10. Even with a quick five minute wait, I was as happy as ever. Where else can you get a breakfast box with duck confit, eggs and potatoes. A messy box of pure enjoyment. My wife ordered the New York cheesecake French toast which was nothing short of amazing.

Equally important to amazing food, the staff have never done anything less than impress. Our server was friendly, engaging and always on top of any needs. All the other staff appear to pitch in and keep the entire dining room running smooth.

It wasn't my first time in OEB and it certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"My first poutine experience in Canada so I had high expectations and they were met!  OEB is a cute, tiny place that is packed for a reason.  We were told our wait would be about 20 minutes and definitely got seated before that.

My boyfriend had the confit de canard ($17.25 CAD) which is a poached egg cooked to your liking with sous vide duck confit and jam.  All the flavors went so well together!  Every bite was perfect.  I had the gold digga ($18.50 CAD) which is a poached egg to your liking and lots of pork belly and truffle.  I'd say it was good but after a couple of bites it became challenging for me to swallow, literally!  Overall, my boyfriends duck confit was the winner."}
{"text":"We liked the food, great selection of food. For the price they charge, there should be some fruit or veggies to go with the food. We ordered eggs benedicts. The plate was a bit unbalanced with only the eggs Benedicts."}
{"text":"Love to go to this place! It is so popular that if you just drop in, the line is up to 2hours! Recommend to use NoWait App to get in line ahead."}
{"text":"I'm gonna cut to the chase:
Amazing service
Great decor and atmosphere
Delicious food
We had the crab benny with added avocado and it was very tasty
We also had the Gold Digga \"box\" with added avocado and that was phenomenal. The potatoes are insane! Poached eggs - cooked perfectly.
Drip coffee was stellar too."}
{"text":"Always good, usually have to wait to have a seat but that's a sin it's enjoyed by many...good quality food and taste is ON POINT!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had since I moved here, regardless what I order. Long waits have been rectified by implementation of the No Wait app, which gives an estimate of time prior to even making a reservation. Staff is friendly without being smarmy, Love it."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. The decor and the food were both so good. The whole meal came to around $40 plus tip. You definitely want to use the Yelp waitlist as the wait time would be long otherwise. 

Had the soul bowl and I regret not adding mushrooms and avocado but it was still delicious. Look at those lardons!"}
{"text":"I'm not quick to give out 5 stars but this place was on point.  Service was really good...  We got a seat as soon as we arrived (probably helped that it was later in the morning) and our waitress promptly brought us waters.  

We ordered our food and it came out really fast, which was awesome.  The food tasted fresh and the portions/prices were good.  I didn't get coffee but my better half did and her cup was never empty.

Definitely recommend if you are in the area and in need of some good breakfast eats."}
{"text":"This place doesn't need any more compliments! They got it all! I love it, I love it, I love it! My only request would be to roll back the good old recipe for Croque Madame, when It used to be in a thick slice of sour dough bread, ham, duck fat herb fries, cheese, hollandaise sauce and poached eggs.... Damn that was SO GOOD! It used to be my best favorite. Roll back the recipe, please!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town. Simply go there and try it out yourself: great and friendly staff, huge menu and also some healthy options. My favourite: Breakfast @ Tiffany"}
{"text":"Downtown Oeb is my favorite breakfast place! I have had their breakfast in Tuscany, rabbit eggs Benny and a couple other breakfast dishes whose name I don't remember. All of them have been delicious!!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife went light and had a \"scramblette\" that I coveted. She really enjoyed it. I had a very rich poutine that is still with me 4 hours later as I write this. Service was great. Coffee mugs were big I really enjoyed this breakfast."}
{"text":"The wait times are off the charts. The food is good but I don't think its worth the wait. there are other breakfast/brunch places in the city that are just as good or better with little to no wait times."}
{"text":"The food has been excellent the few times I have been. I love their new feature that allows you to put your name in line from the comfort of your warm bed and then make your way over the coming 2 hours!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for breakfast...and one of the worst places to get in. If you have the patience and can break through the two barriers to this place (parking and waiting lines), you won't be disappointed. The public parking lot...forgetaboutit. You're better off parking in the neighborhoods and taking a nice little stroll. Afternoon lunch...forgetaboutit. You're better off with an early morning breakfast. I arrived a little past 8am and was seated right away...as I was leaving around 9am, there was already a line forming outside! I've seen folks in the dead of winter lined up outside...are they fools or just someone who appreciates a good meal...maybe a bit of both. Most restaurants would love to have this problem but this place certainly earned it.  Looking forward to trying their other dishes...at around 8am!

Gold Digga...5 stars. Tastes as good as it looks! The eggs are poached to your liking (soft, medium or hard). The hollandaise is thick and flavorful. The porkbelly and potato wedges are perfectly fried. The cheese curds and black truffle are simply icing on the cake. Just a very satisfying dish!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Incredible breakfast selection with fresh eggs, meat and fruit. Get there early or wait times are going to suck. Highly recommend this place for a fantastic breakfast with a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Finally a fantastic breakfast and lunch restaurant on 4th Street in Mission. I had the yogurt and it was awesome my banana bread was served warm, yes warm nice touch. My friend loved there eggs benny. Great service, I'm coming back for sure. I love the decor and design of the interior. 
Five thumbs up"}

{"text":"Love it. 

I've been long over Cora's and needed somewhere new for a Saturday brunch fix. This place is super busy, but I went around 12:30 on a Saturday and was seated fairly quickly. Though, I don't recommend going at this hour as the line quickly grew after we were seated. 

The interior is fun! It's got a great vibe, the service is great, the food is cheap.. and most importantly the food is GREAT."}
{"text":"Great open vibe and the food reflects the atmosphere well. There are a good number of great breaks spots in Calgary, and OEB is as good if not better than most of them. 
Any breakfast dish is worth checking out, as all are tasty and good value.
The service is fast-paced and friendly, and will help cement a desire to return. 
Enjoy and return..."}
{"text":"Funky place. Great friendly vibe. Helpful staff for first-timers. Wonderful filling food with flair. Worth it and better than the nearby breakfast competition. King's not far away is a stay away from place as it's ersatz in more than one way as a breakfast spot. Would return more often if they didn't have serious competition much closer to my place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and was impressed both times! My first time, I had one of the bennies (cannot remember which one!) and it was really tasty - good combination of ingredients, but most importantly, the poached egg was perf. The second time, I had one of the Box'd features, namely gold digga which features pork belly. Personally, not a huge fan of the way the pork belly was cooked - huge chunks that didn't have a likeable texture, so I ended up picking them out. But! The rest of the dish was really good and the yolk ran all over the potatoes and made it even better! The place is pretty small, so aim for early morning weekdays or prepare to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Its a very well done interior!
The employees are nice enough.

I wish I could rember what I had or if it was good, but I can't so thats why its' just Ok'

I know there was something with the peameal bacon being not good, I think it is just like back bacon, you pay more for it, 
You want soy, you pay more for it.
You want to nix your Breakie Potatos cause they have a flour coating and you can't eat flour (this is not me... my nerd friend) instead have a peice of melon sub'd, you pay more...

Overall my memory was:

Ohhhhhh impressive looking, love the wallpaper, Menu looks good.... youll pay more....

Im a sucka for a nice decor, so ill be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Food was great and waitress was attentive. I would recommend this place for the food. Reserved a spot online, but still had to wait longer. Suggest getting here early."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here after hearing all the hype. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and modern decor. The food was fresh and had nice presentation. The potato wedges were crispy and well seasoned. The kitchen was very fast in getting the order out.  

Use the No wait app to ensure you are not waiting for an hour. The line up to get a seat is overwhelming. Is it worth the wait? Maybe if you are looking for an organic brunch."}
{"text":"OEB is a neighbourhood gem. Bustling breakfast / brunch venue. We (2 of us) went on a Tuesday mid-morning and needed to wait 5 mins for a pair of high-stools along the central family style table. There are 2 and 4 top tables as well if a stool isn't to your liking. Staff were friendly and accommodating right away - coffee, table settings etc. We opted for the breakfast rather than lunch menu, and ordered up a Croque Madame, fruit smoothie and a classic eggs, bacon and griddle cakes. The CM was very good, with OEB changing up the bread to their own baked rye (maybe a little dense but tasty) and adding some truffled, finely chopped mushrooms into the mix of cheese and ham. Delish. The griddle cake was so light and fluffly, and the smoothie, not too sweet and a perfect accompaniment. All in all, a very, very good breakfast. Interior decor is fresh, and modern, with an energetic atmosphere - not loud, but lively. We chatted with our neighbours over their 'soul in a bowl' - eggs, cheese curds and potatoes in a to-go take-away box. They liked OEB, and so did we. Go treat yourself to brunch asap!

Update - 2016: OEB is still dishing up some of the best breakfast in town, but we just can't handle the overwhelming popularity they experience on the weekends!! Even with the \"NO WAIT\" app - the line up is hours long. Best to go early on weekdays, and then on the weekends - hit Gruman's deli or other lesser known locale instead."}
{"text":"Better breakfast than OEB is not possible. They have a huge menu and with a lot of unique choices. Great service. Just browse thru the photos on Yelp to get an idea of the food. The food is as impressive as it looks on the photo's.

On a 1-5 scale I would rate it a 6!"}
{"text":"For a breakfast place I find this place wayyyyyy overpriced. Some of these meals are priced the same as dinner meals at an Earles. Do yourselves a favour save the money and go to any of the other numerous places serving breakfast in the Mission / 17th Ave area. Universe, Monki, Nellies, La Boulongerie, Western Cafe, Buttermilk, The Beltliner etc. Priced better and just as good. If you have $20 - $30 to spend on a plate of breakfast and don't feel like that's wasting money eat here. I won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is always ridiculously packed and the wait is often more than a hour. They do have an app you can utilize to pre check in and check your wait time. 

We did not use the app because we found out about it after. Our quoted wait time was between 1.25 and 1.5 hours for three people on Sunday at 940 am.

They did give us the option to buy the food at the take out window and eat it upstairs in the food court. We were still waiting for the 3rd member of our group so we waited. I really needed caffeine and tried to get the attention of the staff at the take it window. After several attempts I gave up, they seemed overwhelmed by people trying to pay for their bills ( you pay at the front not where you are seated ). I was about to go nearby and grab a coffee (20 min or so in ) when the waiter said if we can get our party together right now he can squeeze us in.

Overall I loved the decor and the theme and we got to sit in a egg shape table. The food was good too but very pricey. I had the duck benny and I didn't really enjoy the duck meat texture and flavor. The potatoes sounded so awesome (fried twice and in duck fat) but in reality did not live up to the hype. My English muffin didn't taste toasted either, kinda dry. 

My husband said his New York cheese cake stuffed French toast was very good though."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Food came quite quick, and was to die for!! Highly suggest using yelp to put yourself on the wait list as it's quite a long wait but most definitely worth it. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu and is always a tough decision on what to get. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Not bad - not good. It has a \"tried but didn't quit manage to rip off Cora's\", feel. It may be your favorite place. Just not mine."}
{"text":"If you're a foodie you'll love this place.  Definately worth the wait."}
{"text":"Everything on this menu looked amazing and it was incredibly difficult to choose! Both my boyfriend and I opted for the \"box\" options, which actually come in a large bowl. Let me tell you...I LOVE a hearty breakfast with all my favs stirred together in one skillet or bowl but this was by far my favorite breakfast meal so far! 
The French fries are huge and crispy with a fluffy inside (a bit salty for my taste but it didn't deter me from eating them!) The thick, chunky cuts of bacon were incredible and the poached eggs were perfection mixed with the slightly melted cheese curds!! I kept shifting in my seat in hopes of fitting more into my stomach but I just couldn't and had to leave about 4 bites behind. I am already excited for my next trip to Calgary so we can stop and have brunch here again!"}
{"text":"Visited on a cold morning and ordered the crab eggs benendict. The dish was too salty. I think the combination of crab, hollandaise, and generously salted potato wedges put it over the top. I also wish it came with a little salad or fruit to freshen it up. Overall, the presentation of the restaurant and food were pretty. I would return but order a classic dish. I'd go back for the atmosphere, friendliness of staff and quality and taste of the eggs. The egg yolks were as advertised--dark, creamy and satisfying."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 because they set the bar high, and their always on point! Whether it's blueberry pancakes or lobster eggs bennie, these guys take nothing for granted when it comes to breakfast. Impeccable presentation, and taste. It's fresh, mostly locally sourced, organic... that type of stuff. They take pride in it and it shows.

You can't just show up for a meal and expect to get a table until well after lunch time. It's crazy busy, but it's busy for a reason. You have to use their 'Nowait' app to get in line online. No prob! 

The one thing I didn't like was the diced white onion that went into my eggs bennie last time. Man, I hate white onion--you should tell a fella before you throw that in! There should be some unwritten rule about that. I'll have to make sure they don't do that next time. Sorry for groaning on..."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for breakfast with a cousin I haven't seen in YEARS. We strolled in and there was an intimidating line at the door, but the wait time wasn't as bad as it was @ Diner Deluxe.

They sat us at the end of the big communal table which I always thought was a great thing, I asked the charming couple beside us what they would recommend and they suggested their Soul-in-a-bowl. I read the menu and the only thing my eye picked out was \"Poached eggs\" and \"Quebec cheese curds\". SOLD.

Their Soul-in-a-bowl is AMAZING. Imagine what a poutine, breakie-bowl, and eggs benedict breakfast rolled into one would taste like...I know, I thought so too it tastes like a party of insanity! I also had their fried tomatoes and buttermilk pancakes on the side. The tomatoes were fresh and complimented the soul-in-a-bowl. But the pancakes had the audacity, the sheer audacity to be DAMNED delicious. It was just one massive piece to try, but one of the most memorable pancakes I've had in a long time.

My cousin also had their eggs benedict, which was quite filling for him. He gave great advice when it comes to eating out. \"Never order anything you can't make at home\"

Another great breakfast joint within the breakfast center of Calgary!"}
{"text":"Canadian Eggs Bennie was excellent, fresh fruit on the side, home potatoes deep fried in duck fat

Excellently cooked and served"}
{"text":"BAD service !!!  (2 stars for service)

Came in on July 15 with a group of six around 1pm. Our server not sure of her name (blonde hair in a bun Caucasian) was not very friendly.... anyways at the end she tells us groups of 6 has added gratuity. At the end we did seperate bills and I paid for my sisters as well... so for some reason the gratuity was double the amount... but my cousin noticed and let our server know. Her response was \"it happens a lot\" and she didn't bother apologizing to any of us. If it ha pens a lot shouldn't u be double checkin or changing the system. The food had nice presentation and was overall okay.  Nothing special"}
{"text":"Hogs and Scallops, Soul in a Bowl. Delicious. The scallops were silky inside and still juicy. Not fishy at all. The sear on the outside was just gorgeous. Eggs a perfect medium. I was able to request half fresh organic spinach and half fries, as I have a habit of eating everything in my plate. Or in this case, my bowl.

My friends ordered the crab benny and the stuffed banana French toast. I tasted a bite from each and it delicious. Big portions. Great prices for the portion and local ingredients. 

I'll be coming more often now that OEB has the NoWait app."}
{"text":"In Calgary for one day in transit back to the states from a great time in Banff. Stopped by this place based on rave reviews. Showed up at 7:15AM on a Friday morning and was lucky to take up the last two seats at the community table. Service was good, Brianne, our server was sweet and took the time to run down the entire menu. We both got one of the breakfast bowls, mine with pork belly and husband's with the duck. Eggs were poached perfectly and fries cooked to perfection. I was not a fan of the pork belly bowl, but I should have known as I'm not a fan of pork belly period. I realize how idiotic I sound right now, but while visiting Canada I came to realize pork dishes are quite popular and decided to finally give one a try it at this place. I ate the eggs and some of the fries and it was quite heavy. Wish I had gotten the half fries half spinach option that Brianne had mentioned but I was being greedy. My husband however loved his duck dish and he is quite picky with duck. He enjoyed his dish so much, licked the bowl clean, and even thanked me for finding the place/suggesting it. I would definitely come back and try another dish, maybe one of their eggs benny which looked delicious. I will say though I did enjoy my experience and husband enjoyed his dish so much I recommended my parents to go to the restaurant. They went the following day, around brunch and it was PACKED and they were initially told it would be very difficult to accommodate them. My mother was pretty disappointed and let the hostess know that they were just transiting through Calgary and I had insisted they come here. The hostess kindly did her best and after a 15 minute wait, they were able to get a table. My parents thoroughly enjoyed both their dishes (Tuscany and Lobster Scramble). Only caveat (especially for non Canadians) - cash or debit only. No credit cards. If you pay USD they give it to you at a 1:1 rate instead of the actual conversion rate."}
{"text":"Tripped across this place by accident, because I rode by on my motorcycle this past summer and saw a lineup... People don't line up for bad food, and I had time to kill before an appointment, so I dropped in.  
    The first time I had the Benny Sends Me traditional eggs benedict, and loved this flavourful take on a classic. The eggs and ham were perfect, the hollandaise creamy but not too heavy and the English muffins toasted just right so they were crisp but not too dry.   The staff were friendly, relaxed but efficient ... a \"well oiled machine\".   
    I went back yesterday with my lovely wife and had the same great experience with the staff.  This time I tried the Soul In a Bowl, which is like eggs benedict poutine!  It's hard to get potatoes wrong, but it still stands out when someone gets them so right!  
     My wife had the Healthy Primavera, and loved it, saying it was really rounded out by the high quality of the feta cheese.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Quick! Someone awesome and new to Calgary is in town to visit and you only get to show them one YYC hot spot. Where do you go?! If it's during the day, I choose OEB Breakfast Co. Every. Single. Time. Does it mean me having to go there half to an hour before my scheduled meeting time so my guest doesn't have to wait in line? Absolutely. But it you can make the time, OEB is worth every second.

What should you order? Anything. Do it. Order anything that strikes your fancy on this menu and prepare to have your breakfast loving mind blow to smitherines. KAPOW!

 Am I setting the bar to high for OEB. No. No I am not. I don't care how much expectation I build up about this place, I'm confident they will deliver. 

Special Standouts: The breakfast poutines. My god, man. I don't care if they didn't invent these babies, they've taken them to a whole new level. The most insane brekky I've EVER had, is undoubtedly the Fois Gras Breakfast Box. It's a Chinese take-out box loaded with Duck fat cooked potato wedges, Quebec cheese curds, black truffle shavings, topped with two (perfectly and insanely delicious) poached eggs, topped with brown butter hollandaise and, oh yah.. FOIS GRAS!  Big spender alert: It says \"market price\" but this is usually somewhere in the area of $25. I don't usually buy it, but I can definitely say it's worth it. If you're looking for THAT breakfast, and for THE OEB experience. Get it, and don't look back.

Coming in breakfast box close second is The Gold Digga. Swap out the Fois Gras and replace it with the massive cubes of pork belly and you've got yourself a Gold Digga. I've ordered this a few times now. For how unreal delicious this thing is for around $16, it's hard to justify the extra 9ish bucks for the fois gras. I mean, that's a whole extra Caesar you could be ordering. (Which are only ok... while not their specialty, it would be nice to see the same care and quality put into their drinks as is their food.)

I'm a savoury breakfast fella, but every time I've been to OEB, someone always orders something that ALMOST pulls me over to the sweet side. Everything here looks and smells so good!

Funny notes: They sometimes take the food descriptions a little far for me, making me feel like I'm in an episode of \"Portlandia\". I get it - it's not the cheapest place, so the more you can sell me on how what I'm eating is better, and I'll buy into it because the quality definitely shines in the final prouduct. They let you know where everything is sourced from all the way to \"Amish raised pork shoulder\", which for me, has provoked fun table conversation. \"What was the pigs name? Did it have many friends? Was it only raised Amish? What happened when it grew up? Did it leave the colony of Amish pigs to make it in this lonely world and then subsequently wind up on my plate?\""}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch selection I've ever seen. I found the food tend to lean a bit towards the saltier side for my tasting, but so what, it's still delicious. But I'd hope the coffee can be slightly stronger. I need my morning coffee full of caffeine :P"}
{"text":"One of my fav breakfast spots! I love their smoked salmon Benny! Fav in the city. Also their breakfast poutine is delish!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, hell yes. I ordered, what I called in my mind, breakfast poutine and I could not have been happier with my choice. The Soul in a Bowl (my order) was two poached eggs with potatoes, cheese curds, bacon lardons, and brown butter Hollandaise and I added avocado to that. It was exactly as delicious as it sounds. Also delicious? The coffee. And they let you have mugs of it while you wait for your table.

Oh, yeah, you'll most likely be waiting for a table. Because everyone is on the up and up about this deliciousness. And the place is fairly small. But, totally worth the wait. I dream of breakfasting there again."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better place for brunch than OEB! Their menu is so large that I have to come here more often. It's got the cutest decor of Eggs and they even have an adorable Egg booth. I just cannot say enough good things. 

The portion sizes are pretty good here too. I got the Arty-Choked Preserva. I thought it was a good option to go with that had enough veggies. I thought it was a good choice on the healthier side.

I've tried the Wild boar Spalla. It's massive btw! Great for sharing. The cured wild boar is wrapped around the brioche making just a heavenly blanket.

The Breakfast at Tiffany's is on the lighter side of things on the menu. It's perfect if you don't want to be too full, but love smoked salmon. 

Whatever you choose to get, don't think you're just limited to those options! Upgrade your meal by adding extra eggs, or sausage, or even potatoes. They have so much to choose from, that it's definitely my go to when visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"Busy place-for all the right reasons. Breakfast was excellent. Presentation was very cool with large plates and large servings and fresh fruit that was truly FRESH. Very well done and a refreshing change from your typical breakfast stop. Pancakes were perfect -crispy on the outside and fluffy and tasty on the inside. Try the crab benny as it was delicious. The only problem was it is very tight and cramped. Felt uncomfortable while eating as people and servers brushing against me made me feel like I was eating on the subway in NYC. We sat at the large shared table and it was very cramped. I think I may have been violated by the gal next to me but the breakfast helped me get over that quickly. 
Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Comes pretty close to Danny's and Ihop, when it comes to breakfast. Only thing they need to improve on is the service time. I guess they still learning to manage the rush hours."}
{"text":"It is hip, trendy, and amazing! Great food, great staff, and everything is local and organic or natural. 

This has also got to be one of the cleanest restaurants in the city; you feel like you are at a spa. Everything is warm colored and clean. It is impressive!"}
{"text":"Thursday March 29 1pm- Starting out with a positive as the food as per usual was amazing . I have been to the Edmonton Trail location many times ( it is always so busy !)  , this was my first visit to mission.,, that being said there was moderate traffic at mission, (but not a full house ) We waited to be even acknowledged for quite some time as staff walked past us. Finally a gentleman approached us ( seemed like the manager ).he seemed confused and overwhelmed, although it was not a full house and seemed appropriately staffed. He also took our drink order and then we waited for menus or someone to ask us our order. We were confused who our server was. The food was amazing. Although we had to ask for cutlery. Once we were done we asked for separate bills. My friend paid w card at the front whereas I left cash for
Mine on the bar where I sat. As we walked out the manger yelled goodbye to us ( which I thought was interesting considering no one was greeting customers at the door the whole time which would seem to be more a priority in terms of service... THEN he chased after us asking did u pay separately ??! Implying I maybe did not pay my half . Being from a managerial background I feel this manager was very confused , did not properly zone staff ie greeter and was running around trying to help randomly instead of setting a calm tone and pace for his staff who mostly at the bar also seemed lacking direction. ( ex. When our order was taken the waitress proceeded to walk over an clean another table before she entered the order although no one was waiting !) 
Poor management , lack of Sensible prioritizing ! Very odd to watch .
Food was amazing - gold digga recommended!"}
{"text":"This was a straight spiritual breakfast experience. The crepes are fantastic, the french toast trifle is miraculous, and the twice-fried potatoes are bomb. Their butter is shaped like a raspberry, straight artsy. Jesus would give this place an A+."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I had the Confit de Canard.  I requested to have more spinach instead of potatoes because I don't like potatoes. The food came really fast. The duck confit, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce warm up the raw spinach and it's perfect for people like me who normal hates cold, raw veggies. The flavor of the soft yolk, hollandaise, asiago, and jam blend together as one delightful sauce. This is comfort food at its best with a nice touch of creativity. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for my first time in Calgary. The breakfast in Tuscany was delish. Seasonal fruit was solid. Not just your average fruit dish."}
{"text":"Always great food and the environment is very cute! This is definitely my go-to breakfast spot for a nice brunch out or when someone asks my recommendation!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS GREAT. YUM. this is definitely a top recommended breakfast spot in the city by me!"}
{"text":"OEB is always yummy yummy yummy!  I absolutely love coming here.  They have an amazing menu - tons of choices, with fresh and unique ingredients.  We tend to stick with the bowls as you get a variety of everything including OEB's delicious roasted potato wedges.

I do like that they are on NoWait, but get in line EARLY on weekends!  The wait was up to 2 hours, and even when we did arrive when the app told us to, we still had to wait for a table.  That would really be my only complaint - they have some kinks to work out with using the NoWait app to get a table."}
{"text":"OEB came highly recommended by friends, so my boyfriend and I decided to check it out.  I had a dish with a lot of delicious duck on it - I can't remember the name, but it was sort of a breakfast bowl/hash with yummy breakfast roasted potatoes.  Not huge portions but we left with very happy bellies.

My only comment for improvement was that their No Wait app wasn't working properly. We arrived after lunch, but still waited quite a while for a table, as we weren't able to get in line from home.  Assuming they got this fixed, we would make the trek to Bridgeland for more deliciousness."}
{"text":"Over Easy is EASILY my favourite breakfast joint in Calgary! The extensive menu makes it extremely difficult to choose one thing. The last time I went I had two pieces of french toast sandwiched around a piece of cheese cake, with a baileys cream sauce. It was amazing. The service is always good and fast. 

Unfortunately, there is always a massive line-up. I have not yet tried the \"NoWait\" app, but have heard that it makes the wait much shorter and the experience even better."}
{"text":"Food was really good but our server only came around twice. Didn't even ask how our food was or asked if I wanted to pack up my meal. After waiting 20mins for her to come over we got up and asked someone for a to go box and packed it up ourselves. I'll come back but won't have high expectations for service which is a shame."}
{"text":"Choices

I mean that's if you don't read all the reviews which seem to all point to the Soul in a Bowl as the Bomb.Com...
But in true fashion I broadened my horizons and scoured the extensive menu and went with the waffle (I know boring but trying to watch my figure).  Anyway - truly an amazing waffle.  The flavor was perfect and the waffle was light and crispy!
My daughter had the Benny upstream and can I tell you I would swim upstream, against the current (and wait line), to have that next time!
My tastebuds sang.
I will be back.
I will try the soul in a bowl, after the Benny Upstream!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  Menu variety is amazing.  Many healthy options, and the service was incredibly fast.  The Indian-inspired avocado sandwich was delicious.  There were many other choices I could have made that arrived at neighboring tables.  Must-try breakfast in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Passing through Calgary from the airport to Banff, found this little gem on my way and truly made my day. Good juice, coffee and food.... will definitely return if I ever came back up here!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge breakfast person but oeb is freaking delicious. I've ordered the lox Benedict and the holy crab and both meals were absolutely delicious. The benedicts and the duck fat fries are very rich but that's why they have fresh fruit on the side! 

The wait isn't that bad if you time it right on the nowait app. Remember to bring cash or debit because they don't take cc which sucks."}
{"text":"OEB Breakfast is a great place to hang out for a morning breakfast or brunch. However, do make sure that you reserve your place in line on the NoWait app. Sometimes waits can be especially long (I'm talking in the hours). Food is great here and one of my favorites is the breakfast bowls. There's one in particular with scallops (seafood in the morning can work!) but they have limited quantities and make sure to get there early. Now the only reason I didn't give OEB a 5 star, but instead gave them a 4 stars, is I found their presentation has been going downhill over the years. They used to place fruits on the sides of their dishes (those like omelettes and eggs benedict and such). However, recently they've been lacking! Bring back the fruit! It makes us feel like we're getting our 5 servings a day as well as brings up the presentation of the places back up to the standard they used to be at. Overall though, good place for some breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"Great food and service.. but the wait times are ridiculous, so I rarely go anymore. If you're cool to wait over an hour for breakfast then by all means hit up OEB!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always amazing but price is a little high. I would have given them five stars but I feel everything is priced a bit to high for breakfast food. Keep up the good work guys and keep in mind  breakfast shouldn't  cost $50 for two people to eat."}
{"text":"the following description is of my experience at the restaurant getting the service of the restaurant:  small tiny space.  kitchen tiny and full of too many chefs.  Food was nothing special, wrap was kind of cold.  Food just simple.  Eggs in everything."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast today, it is a MUST to use the App - NoWait. This is a GREAT feature for them to utilize. I get in line for a table as I'm leaving my place and when I arrive the table is ready or nearly there. 
The service was tremendous, didn't get his name but he did a great job. You can really see the team mentality here, everyone is attentive to all customers. My coffee was never empty, and my water was always full! 
Thanks again for a wonderful time. See you again."}
{"text":"OEB is one of my top choices for brunch. If you are going on a weekend, I recommend going at an earlier time (perhaps 9am-ish) or much later after the lunch rush (after 2pm) as the waits are extremely long and the entrance is tiny so you'll have to wait outside. Also, OEB is a cozy little place, so it is a bit squished in terms of seating.

There is a parking lot right next to OEB, but there is free street parking on the sides so I would recommend parking there to save a few bucks.

I think the brunch food ranges from $10~15 which is pretty average for a brunch place. I have tried multiple things on their menu; the soul in a bowl is SO GOOD (basically like a breakfast poutine with poached eggs!) and the eggs benny is okay, but nothing amazing. Their crepes are also really good but I would think that is more of a dessert item than a breakfast item.. but to each their own! Also, I love the potato wedges here! One of the best things on the menu, and perhaps one of the best potato wedges from a breakfast place in Calgary! I always order them on the side, if they are not included in my meal.

The coffees are great here but I don't think the smoothies are anything special. The last two times I got it, I found them to be lacking flavour and pretty bland. I had to ask for more honey. I will probably just stick to juice if you are looking for some fruity drinks.

Anyway, overall OEB is definitely worth a visit for any brunch lovers!"}
{"text":"I love OEB and am so glad they opened a new location! Service and food are still up to the high OEB standard that the Edmonton Trail location has made me used to. Being able to have my breakfast for lunch in the middle of the workday is a bonus to the downtown location. The decor is fun and very unique. Food came out super fast and was delicious."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ELBOW DRIVE LOCATION.  
This is a new location so they are probably working out the kinks, but I would have to say that the food and the way the food was served (not the service, the service was fine, but how the food was presented) could use a bit of work.
The \"Soul in a Bowl\" that my friend had was served in a far too vertical box rather than in a Bowl (don't you think Soul in a Bowl should be served in a Bowl??) .....not nearly as easy to eat, and too hard to get at any yolk that gets down to the bottom. Overall I'd say it was awkward to eat that way at best. I ordered the Eggs Florentine, a personal favourite. I found the English muffin was either over-toasted or too old. Should have been lightly crispy on the outside while still soft on the inside. These had a bottom crust that was difficult to even get the knife through and no tender centre...aaargh! And the spinach was a less than generous portion. I know it steams down to nothing when it's cooked, but not an excuse in my book, especially when it's certainly being paid for. 
I will go back for sure in a month or so to see if things have improved, but in the meantime, there are a few things they need to work on.
Another consideration: I do not know what the heck some restaurant designers have rattling around in their heads these days, but it certainly isn't any common sense or consideration for an aging population! Both myself and my sister are 60+ and petite. We simply could NOT get up onto the ridiculously high stools! Not only very high, but not at all sturdy. Framed in flimsy metal tubes. My sister especially found it challenging as she's had a hip replacement. If you are bring parents or grandparents, make sure to request a low table."}

Another consideration: I do not know what the heck some restaurant designers have rattling around in their heads these days, but it certainly isn't any common sense or consideration for an aging population! Both myself and my sister are 60+ and petite. We simply could NOT get up onto the ridiculously high stools! Not only very high, but not at all sturdy. Framed in flimsy metal tubes. My sister especially found it challenging as she's had a hip replacement. If you are bring parents or grandparents, make sure to request a low table."}
{"text":"Great service ! Wicked breakfast. Awesome mango mimosa and garnished Cesar. Ask for Leighsha and Matt! This place keeps busy so perhaps make a reso before ya head over. The interior design is incredibly unique to their company and quite whimsical. The vibe here is happy and chill with really cool staff, seriously they made our experience great. I myself had the double trouble with added avocado; EPIC PORTION, definitely taking half of this baby home. The bf had the Moroccan style Lamb Burger and fries which he said was bomb. If ya want great food and service come here!!"}
{"text":"So good! Super busy place though, had to get our food from the to-go window on Sunday morning around 10am because the wait was over an hour for a table of 3 . But the food was excellent =)"}
{"text":"Well if your having trouble choosing a place for brunch this is a perfect spot! Everyone will agree by the wait times, if your smart and think ahead OEB uses the app \"no wait\" and before you even leave your house you can add yourself to the line! It gives you an approximate time for when your tables going to be ready so you can head down just in time to walk in and be seated.

Once your in the cute lil space your going to be in for a treat! There menu is massive and everything amazing, try not to get stuck with a favourite, which will be hard because I'm a sucker for the lobster scramble box! But try your best to order something need when you go back because its all mouth watering. They even have there boxes to go! Staff is always on point and friendly wanting to make your time there special."}
{"text":"So, my friend and I wandered into OEB as a matter of default because a nearby  restaurant we had intended on going to was closed - and wow, did we luck out! OEB Breakfast Co. is my new exciting restaurant to tell people about!

Walking in, I immediately felt comfortable in the fresh and modern décor, complete with chalk drawings and pics on the ceiling. (Unique touch, I thought).

We were seated immediately - even though the place was packed as it was 12 noon and the lunch crowd was out in full force. Might I add that there were a wide variety of ages seated in the restaurant. I believe on the door said that they were able to seat 50 people max.

We had a great table right in front of the window - always my favourite place to be seated!

Glancing at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to be able to decide what to order. The menu was pretty big - with lots of variety  - breakfast options, burgers, sandwiches - and some of the yummiest food combinations you can imagine. (think pork belly, truffle oil, applewood bacon, etc.)

We started with steaming cups of organic coffee and just when I thought I was going to have a wicked eggs benny with yummy truffle oil, I saw the order arrive at the table next to us. One of the orders was an amazing looking spinach salad adorned with fruit the other order was a brioche-like bun piled high with pulled chicken, applewood smoked bacon, aioli sauce, lettuce and tomato.  

Guess what I ordered? Yes, the pulled chicken. It. was. amazing. It came with herbed potato wedges that were cooked in duck fat. They were extra delicious! The garnish was substantial and edible -  strawberry, a bunch of grapes another beautiful fruit - maybe passionfruit? 

My friend had a seafood omelette which she just raved about.

The lunch crowd thinned out and we ended up chatting and staying for awhile. The server was awesome and refreshed our coffee three times. 

Go and enjoy OEB, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Food is not well seasoned. The area is nice and decorated very well and one of our servers was very courteous and even spoke to my mother in her language which was very sweet, the other server seemed busy but did her job. Wait time was long so be sure to make a reservation but overall, service was good for the most part, food was plain."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch!  Everything was cooked fast and delicious. Service was attentive.  Could not have been any better. Only wish we lived here so we could eat here more often."}
{"text":"Delicious.

It was so good that I went back the next day.

I had the Hog and Scallop. I substituted the hog for shredded chicken.

I wish I lived in Calgary so I could go back.

It was just really well seasoned. I high recommend this place."}
{"text":"As always, the food is good, the line-up long. Just be aware that the Edmonton Trail location will be closed for the entire month of November (2017) in order to help with the opening of their new Mission area restaurant. If you've been in lately you've probably seen the note they have posted at the cashiers. If you've not been the one to go up to the cashiers you may not even be aware of their plan so don't be disappointed and you show up at this location in November."}
{"text":"Update- I did review this place already and it pretty much sounds like this one, just under a similar name 

I find it hard to believe I havent posted a review yet, as I've been here many times.  There are so many amazing looking options on this menu- so far my fav is a Primavera special with artichokes, set on arugula- Delish.  Coffee is okay.  The service is okay - they are always super busy and therefore kind of distracted.  For a treat, I like to buy eggs here (1 1/2 dozen maybe??) that are farm fresh and actually crazy delicious compared to grocery store eggs- you get them in a basket, and if you return with the basket for a refill, you get a slight discount on the eggs.
Stick to breakfast- I had the burger here once and while it was good, they really excel in breakfast and egg dishes.
Try to get a regular table- I'm not a fan of sitting in the middle high table where you are often jostled with servers and patrons walking the really narrow paths; and there really isn't a spot to place your purse.
Use the NoWait app to get in line before you even leave home and/or monitor the wait times- as wait times can get really long here, up to 3 hours!"}
{"text":"The past 3 times I have been for brunch- all really good meals with no disappointment at all.  Actually, the toughest part is trying to decide from the tonnes of options that all look super tasty.  The No Wait app is necessary to avoid waiting too long.  And buying a basket of fresh farm eggs after brunch- love this option, actually it is now mandatory for me, as these eggs are amazingly delicious.  
I even had a burger there once- tasty but I would recommend the breakfast specials over lunch meal."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday for lunch. It was easy to find and was a really unique set up. There are separate tables, and group tables, and bar style seating by the windows. I was seated quickly and my meal came quickly. It's definitely a quick turnaround place being downtown with all the business personnel that utilize it. The food was good.  The menu was extensive and I'd really like to go back and try a few other things. I chose the basic breakfast this time, which included 2 eggs, potatoes wedges, 2 pieces of bacon, and a piece of toast."}
{"text":"We ate Breakfast at the New OEB Bridgeland this morning. The food was outstanding but the service/system is understandably still being ironed out. They care and I bet it will be as good or better than there old location on Edmonton Trail which is now closed.
I had a new version the the Notorious Thuringer Bratwurst D.O.G. and ate it all. It was accompanied by a delicious waffle potato fry and a soft egg to crown the top. My wife had delicious Benny almost done as ordered. One egg was medium and one way too hard. The restaurant had a small but very clean and well appointed bathroom. The isles were roomy enough to allow passage for people and service staff. This is a great improvement on the old location. The decor was bright and alive with a noisy busy atmosphere which I think gives this restaurant its charm. 
We walked to the restaurant and will be back again and again in the future. 
Quite pricy but great value."}
{"text":"Waitress was super friendly and funny! I had the What Dreams Are Made Of, it's French toast stuffed with cheesecake and it was very good. I was surprised it didn't come with any syrup and it would cost me if I had some.. I also wish it came with some strawberry's or had some chocolate drizzle? Also the potato's are very very good. I will definetly  be back."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing to write about, typical brunch menu, not bad but not worth going out of your way for"}
{"text":"We got the Hog and Scallops in the boxed menu and the French Toast Trifle. Both were amazing! The place was packed and we had to wait awhile to sit but the staff was really friendly and once we were seated, service was crazy fast and we got our food quickly and it was hot. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"It's the line that has kept me away from OEB thus far.  But today I didn't see anyone outside and although there were people inside waiting I got the magical \"if you will sit at the bench we'll get you in right away\"  so I stayed for my first OEB meal. 

The sounds of the menu items is pretty magical... I took a while to decide what I should try here in the 2 years I've been waiting for a chance to come in. 

I went with truffled squash eggs benny opting for the spinach over the potatoes to keep things vegetarian.  I wouldn't have thought i'd like squash on a benny but I did. 

The only strange thing about my dish was the visual appeal.  After I popped my yolks (free range and a rich orange) the yolk and squash made my plate resemble carrot juice and I find it a bit off putting and I realize i'm being rather picky with that detail there.

Over all this is probably the best breakfast place I can think of in Calgary.  Not my favorite ever but it's by far a great gourmet breakfast experience for anyone who likes good food and appreciates some of the flavor profiles they select for the dishes. 

I love how all the plates have a slice of dragon fruit - something I associate with huge expense for the middle of winter in this city... so that's pretty wow-worthy.   

There pricing is on the steeper side but it's deserved and obviously they have the clients that agree because the lines suck.  Which brings me to the draw back -  20 minute drive to stand in an hour line for breakfast?  Hmmm...  I won't be here too often and I will try to come back!"}
{"text":"Our favourite breakfast place!  Been coming here since before having kids and keep going back with the kids.  Wonderful staff, consistent and delicious food.  Cool menu.  Love that they have 3 locations now."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot in town! 

I have waited 2+ hours for a table and it's worth it every time! 

The eggs Benny are always a favourite, but the poutine breakfasts are a hit as well! 

OEB is always the top of my list for breakfast in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, front of the house is always great.
Food is always perfect!
Make sure to download the app to get your name in line otherwise you'll be told you have a 2-3 hour wait ahead of you!"}
{"text":"First of all the best way to have a great experience here is to get the 'No Wait' app.  When you arrive, check in with the hostess and wait near the door.  They came and found us and seated us much quicker than they said they would.  The french toast is a MUST!  The best french toast - not soggy and a great lemony flavor.  I will be coming back for this alone!"}
{"text":"What can I say. Visiting for the long weekend and ended up coming to OEB two days in a row! I can see why there are long waits for this place as I wasn't left disappointed. My recommendation is if you can plan ahead, reserve your table on yelp as they will provide you a rough wait time and how many people are in front of you. Don't try and cheat and book a reservation at other locations because you can only book one. (lesson learned)
For our first visit, I started off with a mimosa followed by one of the signature breakfast poutines, their Tuna Crudo while my girlfriend had the Truffle Squash. My second time around I had a pineapple mimosa and as they were sold out of the Chunky Lobster Scramble, I substituted the lobster with crab. She had the Gold Digga. Both times we left very satisfied as everything was soooo good! Some of their items are limited quantities so if you plan on trying one, I would go early. Overall great experience and atmosphere and I would definitely come back again when I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"oeb wow
 the food you really have out done yourselves. mmm.  The breakfasts in the take out boxes just thinking about it makes my mouth water. had my first date w my bf here and I thought what a cute funky hip little place.  The food shocked me how amazing it was. The coffee was hot and fresh service was stellar. why the 4 star not five you ask well its do busy why not open another instead of people waiting outside cold to come eat at your restaurant. The demand is there you are great."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Good sweet goods and good egg bennies.   The pic is Canada egg bennies with brown butter hollandaise sauce. Free range eggs. Busy place always."}
{"text":"This place is great but the wait is horrendous! I've attempted to go 3 times but only managed to eat here once because the wait has varied from 30 minutes to 3 hours!!!! I haven't quite figured out the perfect time to come to minimize my time in line.

The duck box'd breakfast is so, so tasty.  Potatoes fried in duck fat, duck confit and farm fresh eggs served in a take out box is the perfect weekend brunch food. There's the option to swap out the potatoes for spinach, which is what I will try next time because I was too full and there were too many potatoes.  I also had a tropical smoothie which was refreshing.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes my son wakes up at the crack of dawn.  This is our go-to breakfast place when he does so momma can enjoy a coffee and a duck box'd and he can enjoy his gluten free toast and jam with eggs.  Did I mention they accommodate gluten-free, dairy-free diets?  It's great.

I'm usually there quite early so there is a minimal, if any, wait.  But the thing with breakfast/brunch on weekends is the WAIT.   Pre-kids, I have waited HOURS for lunch, which seems ridiculous now.  Luckily, they have a wonderful system where you can put your name down and they'll text you when your table is ready.

I need this location to have hours as good as their Edmonton Trail location because when my son wakes up really really really really really early, I have to drive all the way over to Edmonton Trail because they open a bit earlier than their downtown location."}
{"text":"Above and beyond the best breakfast I've ever had.  My girlfriend and I were in town for a conference for about 5 days and after trying OEB earlier on in the week, we made sure to have it one more time before leaving.  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"OEB left a very positive impression on me. The menu is huge, and the line ups equally so. Calgarians love coming here. They make an awesome eggs benedict and have some excellent waffles on the menu. 

I gave it three stars for one reason and one reason only, they cook their breakfast potatoes in duck fat. Don't get me wrong, my partner LOVED them, LOVE LOVE LOVED them. I, however, am a pescatarian so I didn't eat the potatoes after being warned following ordering. Otherwise it's a great restaurant with a great feel and great staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always amazing and the staff is very friendly. The only bad part is that there isn't free parking close by and the wait time is always really long."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favourite places in Calgary. Love the potatoes, love the soul in a bowl, love that they use local suppliers for coffee and honey for example. Cute place, great service, but terribly long wait times. You can't have it all."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast. I had a savory breakfast and my wife went sweet. Everything was awesome and the portion sizes were great in our opinion. My only complaint I don't think I can level solely at the feet of OEB because it seems to be a Canadian thing, but I get the impression Canadians do not like strong or full bodied coffee. Everywhere we went had weak coffee, which is such a bummer (at least in my world)."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for breakfast! So many things on the menu sounded good and the dishes we ended up ordering were delicious. Got one savory thing and one sweet thing to share since we couldn't decide. The staff is super friendly and the coffee was really good. Highly recommend getting on the waitlist through Yelp to cut down the wait time."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is my go to brunch restaurant when I'm in town.
One of my favorites is the crepes with vanilla custard, berries, bananas & pistachios. 
The service is always friendly and the food is amazing.
Tip: Use the nowait app to add your party to the wait list. This will save quite a bit of time, since there is usually a 30min to 1hr wait for walk ins."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of breakfast goodness! 

Went here for the first time on Easter weekend and have returned 3 times. Can you say addict?  I get the Gold Digga because it's a white box full of things that are delicious. I love me some truffle!! 

Seriously though, if you haven't been go. Like right now.... Go!"}
{"text":"Canadians are very big on \"breakfast overload\" restaurants.

These are places with fine chefs, and high quality raw ingredients that specialize in enormous, highly caloric, over the top breakfasts.

Gigantic frying pans with edges four inches high filled to the gills with sausage, eggs, home fries, pancakes, and and and.

Eggs Benedict with with with.

Massive concoctions with French Toast as a base.

I do not like to stuff my face with 4000 calories at breakfast, and then have to waddle off to a hammock to take a nap.

I would rather start the day lean and mean so i can get some work done.

Dinner is when I don't mind sleeping it off afterwards.

That said, there is definite skill and pulling off these early morning wonders -

and many places fall flat on their execution.

OEB does not, and can really deliver a 4000 calorie breakfast that is perfect in every detail.

This is something I have to respect.

I had to get some work done at a conference, 

So I went for one of the lighter items on the menu.

This was a house specialty called \"Sweet Dreams Are Made of These\".

Instead of 663 big heavy items all together on your plate, there is just one item on your plate.

A mere two thick pieces of french toast, with a wedge of vanilla lemon cheesecake in the middle.

Keep it simple.

They did not provide maple syrup with the French toast, and I personally thank them for that.

The execution on the French toast was magnificent. It was a first rate piece of cheesecake. The flavors blended beautifully. And - by design - the cheesecake partially melted under the heat of the French toast making a lovely sweet creamy gravy.

So I take off my hat to the cook and the kitchen.

The crowd is young affluent Calgary, all Clark Kents with dynamic exciting jobs.

The kitchen staff is all pierced and tattooed and global.

If I had to hang out after breakfast, I would vote for hanging out with the kitchen staff rather than the patrons, but that is just my personal bias.

A not unpleasant place, provided you don't own a bathroom scale."}
{"text":"Amazing every time. Love the menu, décor (OMG I even got to sit in the egg once ) and staff. It's on the pricey side but food is high quality. Love the vibe AND they use the Nowait app. For that reason alone they will continue to get my brunch biz (so other lame-ass no res brunch spots take note)! You think just cuz it's the weekend we can stand in an endless line, getting hangry AF?! Ain't nobody got time for that!"}
{"text":"I decided to treat myself to a solo birthday brekky!

For a Tuesday morning, the restaurant was pretty busy. I sat at the high table in the middle, so I felt everyone looking at me...

Service was meh. I was seated straight away, a few minutes later brought coffee, and then about 15 minutes later my order was taken. Could have been better. I had to flag someone down for more coffee.

The food was phenomenal though. I orderd the Upstream Benny. It was beautiful. The eggs were so bright and fresh. The wedges (cooked in duck fat) were unreal. There was a side of exotic tropical fruit that was amazing.

I would eat here every day, if I could, provided the service was more timely and consistent, and I could wear elastic-waisted pants on a daily basis!"}
{"text":"One of YYC's favourite breakfast joints for sure, and the line on the weekend is a great confirmation that this is where people are going for brunch. As the other reviewers say use the No Wait app to get yourself in live before you go and then check in with the hostess when you arrive closer to when you know there will be a table for you. No one likes being hangry in the morning. The decor is very cute here, all egg themed and kitschy, the atmosphere is something I really enjoy. Now the menu is HUGE, most OEB regulars have found their go-to items and order them time and time again but for first timers it can be hard to make a decision. Lots of options for everyones tastes though, the bowls are very popular and a solid choice if you're having trouble deciding."}
{"text":"OEB is exactly the kind of breakfast place you want to go to at any point in the day. 
Outstanding service, creative menu, great coffee, great retro style but expect to wait on a busy day even though it is worth it. 
No matter what you have to try SOL in a Bowl!

This recommendation is extended by two high profile actors who my boyfriend brought for breakfast last week. They were blown away by OEB."}
{"text":"We went monday on our way through Calgary and fell immediately in love.  It is now Friday and we are driving back through and want to eat here again before we leave to head back to the states. 
The confit duck and egg was spectacular.   We also got a crepe with bananas,  blueberries,  and strawberries in a banana creme with pistachios that was to die for.   The brioche toast is huge an delicious. 
10/10 would come here again,  or weekly if I wasn't from Texas."}
{"text":"Been there a few time in the last few years. Every time, there seem to be something that prevented me from enjoy their food fully. First the place is cramped and loud. It's not a place to sit, chat, relax and enjoy the food. For our last visit, we went on a Saturday morning. Parking was a problem so we were slightly short on time for our next appointment. When our waitress came, we informed her of our situation and made our orders quickly. We both ordered the exact same dish which included delicious waffles, ham and poached eggs plus a small plate of fruits. I mentioned an allergy expecting to have the particular item removed and receiving an alternative in return. Instead, I was told that they pre-cut all the fruits and no alternative arrangements can be made. She then went on to say it would be easier for her to just indicate \"no fruit requested\" for my order. I then asked her to give my portion to my date instead which she refused by putting down \"no fruit requested\". I repeated my request again after her refusal the second time. When the fruit plate came for my date, she indicated that the fruits were dried on the surface and not fresh. Some fruit pieces looked like they've been sitting outside for awhile. However, she did not receive my portion. My request to have my fruit plate given to my date was completely ignored. When the bill came, no adjustment was made. Although, OEB did correct it by giving me a 10% discount afterwards, they made it sound like the waitress couldn't understand my instructions. For good customer service, I believe arrangements should be offered instead of requested then denied. As much as I enjoyed the soft, sweet waffles, I will not return to this location ever again. There are other joints with way better customer services and food quality. Not to mention, also cheaper!"}
{"text":"Overall ok, food was good, portions are generally small for the price but it's not a deal breaker.
We used the nowait app but we still had to wait for another extra 40 mins at the door. Except for that, the service was good and friendly and actually pretty fast considering how busy it was. Worth a try to make your own opinion."}
{"text":"The only downside of this place is very very long times and I have noticed that in the other reviews.
However, if you are looking for a very tasty, fresh brunch/breakfast, I totally recommend this place and it's worth the wait time. I know there is also an app that you might use in order to be aware of the wait time and be placed in the waiting queue. 
We were there for breakfast, and it was super delicious. Watch out as the portions are big and you might want to share the dish.
Our waitress was very attentive and did her best in providing us the best service. The price for food is also great. 
I totally recommend this place and will defend hotels go back."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries saves the day! 

A friend took me to OEB for belated birthday brunch on a Sunday morning. I should've figured it would be busy but not 30-people-already-on-the-wait-list busy. We also didn't know about the NoWait app. We arrived there at 9:30 and was seated by 11. I adopted a new life motto during that time: Always check Yelp tips before trying new restaurants. Thanks Lynn. H. for the tip. Unfortunately, I heeded your advice much too late. 

The space is very cozy, which is always perfect for me because I like snooping other people's dishes to see what they got. We both ordered eggs Benny with duck fat potatoes and fresh fruit. The price was reasonable at $15. We hungrily and patiently waited, while the hustle and bustle of the brunch hungry crowd distracted us from thinking about our empty bellies. Some thoughts that wandered into my head included:

- \"I'm peeking at my neighbors dish like a creep.  Who the heck cares? We're all hungry brunchers!\" 
- \"The avocado and smoked salmon looks so fresh\"
- \"What's that bowl thing? Omg there's bacon in there\"
- \"What else do they cook here with duck fat?\" 

The server wasn't very attentive but our Bennies arrived within ten minutes of ordering. The eggs are free run, fresh, local and cooked to perfectly to a soft and golden oozy state. The salmon was fresh, and the cooked spinach was a great touch to curb the richness of the egg and salmon. 

I saved the best for last though: those duck fat fries were out of this world. They were perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and were amazing without ketchup. Have you ever taken a bite of something and you instantly melted inside, and all your surroundings disappeared? OK, well that's what I felt about OEB's duck fat fries. They made me forget I had to wait 1.5 hours for a table, and they also made me forget about the so-so service. All was forgiven. 

OEB has somehow found it's way to being my favorite brunch spot in town, and it's all thanks to their high quality food. I'll be back again, and I'll be sure to use the app next time I do. 

New life lesson: duck fat fries solve everything"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch/brunch on a Wednesday around noon, they seated us right away in the center, though we would've had to wait longer for a bigger table. The Confit duck was excellent, I would love to go back again to try out more things on their menu, but I don't think I could brave a \"weekend crowd\" but it was pleasant on a weekday. Also, the restaurant was very clean, restroom very clean, etc. Also, I like the fact that the kitchen is open and you can see  the people in the back making the food."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the dumpling and duck confit . Overall, it has a nice vibe and very good service."}
{"text":"The food certainly has a lot of care put into it, from the careful balance of ingredients and seasoning to the plating. And let me just say that THIS is what you call a great breakfast.

I came here with my dad on an early weekday morning and it was already packed and bustling. It was busy, but the atmosphere was warm and lively (similar to that of a good coffee shop). Although we had to wait, we didn't have to for long. Service was decently quick and we were seated within 5 to 10 minutes of first arriving.

The waiter was nice. I wasn't expecting too much conversation from him due to the high volume of people waiting to be served and seated, but he was friendly and gave us suitable care and attention which contributed to the overall positive experience.

As far as the food and beverages goes, they was AMAZING. I had their house coffee, which was served hot (not warm) and smooth. I prefer my brew less acidic in taste and their coffee certainly caters towards that. For my breakfast, I got the classic eggs Benedict: two poached eggs with rosemary ham on an english muffin with hollandaise sauce, fresh cut fruit and twice-fried potatoes. The eggs were cooked perfectly to my specification. The whites were set but the yolk was warm and runny. They were beautifully accompanied by the hollandaise sauce and ham and the english muffin really gave the entire dish some body. The potatoes were hot and crispy (absolutely to DIE for) and they really give you a nice selection of fruit (including dragon fruit and kiwi, compared to the usual watered down melon you get elsewhere).

This was a really great way to start my morning. Give this place a try. It's cute, cozy, and absolutely freaking delicious. I can't wait to get back there and only recommend that you do the same!"}
{"text":"Being on a mandatory gluten free diet because of allergies, you'd Think the staff would a bit more accommodating, but you would be sadly mistaken. I was informed that the hashbrowns come Pre covered in flour, which to me is useless, how difficult would it be to flour hashbrowns (that don't need to be floured in the first place) by order, and I guess it is Much to difficult to cook potatoes without flour if someone requests it. I will Definitely never be returning here ever again, unless the old owners of Country Kitchen decided to re buy the space and put things back to the way they were when people actually treated their Paying customers with decency."}
{"text":"Went for birthday waffles at peak brunch hour on a saturday. The wait was about 1 hour, but well worth it!

They handed out cups of coffee to those of us waiting outside, it was a nice spring day so I didn't mind :)

We were seated at a long, bar-loke table in the middle, but it was still comfortable to have a conversation with the rest of my party of 4, even with other breakfasters sitting beside us. Be friendly calgary!

I ordered the waffle, with all the fixins. I mean ALL of the things! It had english custard, mixed berries, bananas, whipped cream, pistachios and pecans, AND they even added a HUGE tower of swiss meringue to top it off! A huge birthday extravagance! the waffle itself was on the good side of average ( i think it could have been a little thicker and crispier, but I am a waffle once a year kind of gal so I walk in with truly HUGE expectations) but the toppings made it amazing! I only got 3/4 through it all before I gave in! The rest of may table all had great looking breakfasts, and the servers had no troubles in customizing the menu options, and providing fast service.

Seriously, it is a very small joint, but I saw at least 3 servers in addition to bussers, and all of them were actually doing their jobs (this is a rarity in calgary, where shitty service is standard everywhere) Not so at oeb, great service without being suffocating, and out coffee cups and water glasses were refilled constantly even on a busy saturday! 

All the food looked great and tasted even better. Prices i thought were pretty fair, even great! A standard breakfast runs only $8-10, the deluxe versions a bit more but worth it for the luxury ingredients! 

Worth waiting for an hour even on my birthday!"}
{"text":"Shieeeeeeeet. Senator Clay Davis would approve of this joint, and so do I."}
{"text":"Wow! This is an awesome little place that gets how to do breakfast. Had the lobster shrimp and egg crepe, had green onion. Hollandaise sauce and caviar on top. Amazing!!! Everyone around me seemed to love what they had. I'll need to come back many times to taste the menu. And the prices are amazing for the quality. $21 for top quality breakfast with a great cup of coffee. Can't beat that anywhere."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best hollandaise sauce I have ever eaten. Although I am not an avid breakfast diner-eater, OEB has me hooked."}
{"text":"This place was so interesting and yummy! There were egg shaped booths to sit in and lots of egg related artwork on the walls. As a egg lover, I really enjoyed the way that they chose to decorate the restaurant! Haha
I went here on a weekday morning around 10 am so there was no lineup. Its apparently really busy on weekends though so maybe try for a weekday if you can. There are a lot of items on the menu so it was a hard decision but in the end I chose a Box'd option - the A-Lott A-Lox. This comes with poached eggs, cured salmon, dill, cheese curds, caper, and hollandaise sauce on a bed of potatoes or spinach. I chose to have half spinach and half potatoes (trying to be kind of healthy here), in a bowl instead of a to go box. You could also choose to add avocado, or mushrooms to this dish if you wanted. I really liked this dish! The dill was a great flavour to the hollandaise sauce and the eggs were perfectly poached. It was also really filling with the amount of food that they give you. The price is comparable to other breakfast and brunch places as well. 
To drink, I got one of the daily feature lattes which was a chocolate mint mocha today - yumm! 
I was really impressed with this place! On their menu, it says that their eggs are locally sourced (they own a flock of hens) and free run which is awesome! As I was leaving I noticed a couple having dessert crepe and waffle so definitely will need to come back to try that out."}
{"text":"There wasn't a thing that I DIDN'T want on the menu. My boyfriend and I had the most difficult time figuring out what to get, but it seems like this is common amongst patrons. Keep in mind, you need to go early or else some of their special limited dishes will be sold out. Some of our first choices were shot down because of that. You can tell that they use high-quality ingredients and they try to be as local as possible.

I ordered Die Deutsche Riesenkalbsbratwurst and a Very Berry Smoothie, and he got the A-Lott A-Lox \"Box'd\". I was very satisfied with my choice, but for the name, my boyfriend expected more lox to be in there. Still scrumptious though.

During the time we were here, we witnessed several parties being turned away a couple hours before closing because their waitlist was so long. Luckily, my boyfriend is a local and knew of this app called NoWait that allows you to hold a place in line, so when we used it we were 27th, but once we were 10th, we were able to drive down there and wait for only about 10 minutes before getting seated. Really handy especially if you go on a busy weekend like we did. Regardless, just go here and eat your happy heart out. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Always yummy and fresh. The farm eggs are so so good. I am hooked on the Salmon and eggs topped on spinach and added avocado. The perfect Keto meal."}
{"text":"4/5 because the wait time was too long. 
5/5 for the food. 
Their brunch was so good. 
Creative!
Got the scallop and bacon breakfast poutine. 
Yea, this is very popular in Montreal, but in Calgary, OEB makes better poutine!
I love they used wedges fries, crispy on the outside, soft in the inside. The sauce was good, and who can say no to bacon and seafood! Love love! Did I mention, egg yolk is THE perfect sauce for any breakfast. They also asked how I like my eggs poached, very considerate detail. 
I also ordered the French toast, yea, I want both savoury and sweet for ANY meal. 
Too bad I can only eat a certain amount, otherwise I will finish everything!
The freshness of the berries, the puffiness of the toast and the sauce really made the dish special. 


Overall, it was such a great meal. I had a lot of fun hanging out with my dear girlfriend."}
{"text":"The cutest place ever. Friendly staff who are conversational and warm, but not intrusive. I came here with a friend on a cold winter morning and made the hike all the way from the bus stop in the snow, but it was so worth it once we got inside. I would encourage you to make a reservation or plan for something to do as you wait, as I hear the lineups for OEB can be hours! We didn't have to wait when I went, but that was likely due to the odd time we went at and the frigid weather.

The menu is filled with delicious-sounding breakfast items and the entire place radiates a fresh and candid feeling. OEB uses farm fresh duck eggs and they are delicious. What's more, the prices are very reasonable. A great place for a casual breakfast date and a really nice place for conversation. Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed with while dining experience. There food was not worth what felt like ungenuine kindness from a server who clearly never served people with children before. There were 4 of us, including the kids, and yet we only received 2 glasses of water. $19 for a waffle, 2 cage free eggs (not organic) and 4? slices of ham that were nothing special. They used to include a side of fruits in this process. People wasted the fruits so they only offered when asked, but still free... Alas, the side plate of fruits are no longer free, but we were not told this. Extremely disappointed. My sister ordered a gold digga, which was better, but overly salty."}
{"text":"100% the best breakfast I've eaten, homecooked or otherwise. Hollandaise sauce was out of this world. The box'd breakfasts seem to be a marvelous twist on a breakfast poutine. Absolutely worth the 15 min wait. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Greasy food. Terribly overpriced. Not worth it the long wait or price."}
{"text":"Can you believe I've NEVER been to OEB for brunch? There's not much to add but in a nut shell, this is one of the most popular places in Calgary. Expect 2 to 3 hour weekend lineups.

If you want to eat here, get the NoWait app (I specifically downloaded it for OEB). This was my first time using the app but it was simple and straightforward. We signed up at 9:00am Sunday morning and there was already 26 parties ahead of us. About an hour and 45 minutes later, I got a text saying our table was ready. 

The inside is small but quaint. The friendly, easy going vibe here is great. I was expecting it to be packed and chaotic but it was the complete opposite.

Love the chalk board drawings on the ceiling. So talented! The menu is absolutely massive. So many enticing dishes. Their most popular dishes are the Box'd items (with 11 options to choose from); it's basically gut busting poutine.

- Coffee ($2.80 each) - Coffee includes unlimited refills. I don't drink coffee but the two love birds were content with their mugs.

- Gold digga ($16.99) - S and Nbread are the smart ones and shared a Box'd dish. Rich, heavy, carb loading goodness.

- Hog & scallops ($17.99) - Tomtom struggled to finish this on his own but he liked it. I had a bite and it is glutinous. That Hollandaise sauce is crazy good but heavy.

- Moroccan style Alberta lamb burger ($14.75) - I would have liked more emphasis on the Moroccan flavour and for the meat to be cooked a medium rare but they specifically state on the menu that it'll be done well. Not sure if you can request it to be cooked to your liking. Fruit included apple, orange, kiwi, strawberry, pineapple and dragonfruit! The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and crispy - frying them twice in duck fat is genius. 

All the other dishes, especially the sweet ones, coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. Looking forward to coming back and trying more items. Believe the hype! Don't forget to save yourself a lifetime of waiting - get the NoWait app."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for breakfast, my friends loved it!
The decoration is egg themed with lots of yellow and white colors nicely put together. The reservation is done through Yelp or the No wait app. It is a very popular place, we had to wait for 90 mins on a Saturday morning so we planned our morning accordingly. We got a text once our table was ready. Lots of items in the menu and from what I saw, all of them very tasty. Be aware that for groups of 6 ppl or more, there will be a 18% gratuity added to the bill."}
{"text":"A breakfast joint with character. I like. 

Walked in and was greeted with cheerfulness on the ceiling and the walls. Sat down, ordered a coffee and then after browsing their huge menu, I finally settled on the egg breakfast with toast, two pork bangers, and potatos cooked in organic duck fat.

The eggs came out perfect. I ordered over medium and it was not runny yet not overcooked. Potatoes were well seasoned, crisp, fresh and tasty! The toast was thick, and you got a multitude of choice for jam (in fact, a bucketload). I didn't particularly like the pork banger. It had a strong herb scent and doesn't quite taste like the breakfast sausage that I like. 

Service was friendly though a bit slow. They were really busy even on a late weekday afternoon. 

Price was average. $2.50 for coffee, $8.99 for breakfast. I will definitely be back to try out some of those waffles!"}
{"text":"Their duck fat fried potatoes, with cheese curds and brown butter hollandaise sauce is the shit, as in it is damn effing good. I don't normally swear in a review but you too will once you have tried some of their glory."}
{"text":"Man oh man, this was one of the best breakfast joints I've ever been to! I've been wanting to pay a visit here since about 2014 when all the rave was about the HoLY CRaB benny. When I went I had all intentions of giving the crab benny a go, but was so overwhelmed by their HUGE selection of mouthwatering breakfast/lunch options. I probably looked over that menu for a solid 15 minutes before deciding on the Tuna Crudo box. And look at it....just LOOK at it!

I will 110% be coming back here, hopefully I'll be able to try something else because all I want it that Tuna Crudo box 10 more times."}
{"text":"Went here last week for Sunday brunch at around 10. The girl said it was about a 30 min wait but it actually ended up being just over an hour. Sucks that she couldn't estimate better timing because we were standing out in the cold, but at least we knew it was worth it. I especially love when they serve banana bread while you are waiting and they do serve coffee, but don't think that is free. 

Anyway, we get seated and the servers are kind and sweet. I ordered the gold digger and it was delicious! I think anything with truffles is decadent and delicious though and although this dish is a tad on the salty side, it's still very delicious. And hash browns fried in duck fat - wows me every time.

I wonder when they are going to open another OEB - they desperately need to!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Excellent breakfast food!! Everything is fresh, farm fresh, whatever!! Coffee is great! Only down side is that it is so busy and the wait can be quite long. But it is worth the wait because they make the best eggs Benedict!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone that made the original location great makes this new one even greater! A brighter and much larger location with great staff and service! I'll admit though that when the boss isn't working the food can be a bit of a miss sometimes. The pancake this last time came out a bit undercooked and doughy, though it can be forgiven since I do know that it's normally the crispiest and best pancake I've ever had. Due to being a regular Scott (the manager) does go out of his way to make sure we're seated in a timely manner no matter how busy it is. OEB will probably always be my favorite breakfast/brunch joint in Calgary! If you've never gone, you must go! This location is so much better than the original even if the parking is terrible downtown on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, cozy location.

It is likely to always be a bit busy here, given their great breakfast options.  We tried the Eggs Benedict, the Trip, and A few of my favorite things.  All of the orders were delicious and timely - even the fruit on the side was perfectly ripe and sweet, not an easy thing in December."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food here! My friend and I had both ordered a box each and it was way too much for us to finish in one sitting. We ordered:

- Hog and Scallop ($19.20) 
- The Soul in a Bowl ($15.50)

Both items were very tasty, but we both felt that the box was filled up with more potatoes than needed. The ratio of carb to protein and fiber was disproportionate. I think I would have given it more stars if there were more veggie and protein to offset the amount of carbs. All in all, it was very tasty!! And I would definitely dine here again.

The service here was great! The staff here was very friendly and perhaps one of the nicest people we have met at a restaurant. Perhaps because we're both from California and people seem to rush more where we live."}
{"text":"It's been 6 months since my husband, friends, and I have been in Calgary and we are still dreaming of this place. This may have been the best breakfast I've ever had hands down. They're essentially capitalizing on the trendy thing to do of putting eggs over EVERYTHING. Good thing I love eggs and don't have a cholesterol problem yet. My only regret was to not wake up early enough to go one last time before our flight back home.

There are so many tasty sounding things on the menu so your party should try to order different things to try as much as you can. We got (and super enjoyed):
-Croque Madame: sunny side up eggs w/ prosciutto on brioche
-Wild Boar Spalla: eggs over wild boar w/ chipotle aioli and arugula
-Breakfast in Tuscany: eggs over prosciutto w/ avocado and potatos

Portions are ginormous too so make room on your table! And as everyone says, come early because it's a tiny place that gets super busy. At least the service is very fast."}
{"text":"Three times fantastic and worth waiting for.
-The Soul in a Bowl
-Maple Candied Salmon On Buckwheat Crepe
-Berkshire Hog Coppa & Duck Eggs

All perfect blend of food, temperature and quantity."}
{"text":"ooh myy lawwwd ! It was fantastic! Good service even when it was crazy busy, and the food,,,was unbelievably good! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have returned several times because things have improved. They use an application called Nowait and we can now get a spot in line before leaving home, follow our spot in the line, and head on over when we get close - this app rocks!! Plus the food keeps us coming back and service has been fantastic each time. Thanks for making the changes guys, you are now a 5 star in my books!

----- 

Unfortunately the 2nd time here not as memorable. It was cold outside and I was here with my daughter. So they crammed us all inside like sardines while we waited. The only upside was they gave us banana bread & coffee and the hostess was delightful.

When we sat down it was so full of people waiting they were forced to stand up and down the aisles.  If you know how small OEB is well you'll get how cramped it felt. People being pushed up against you as you are trying to enjoy your meal. I over heard someone make a comment about how the Fire Marshall would not approve of the amount of people either.

Our waitress came over without any smile or friendly greeting.  She took our order entered it in then went to another table to take their order.  Surprisingly the other table received their meal 5-10 minutes before we did. Next came my daughter's griddle cake...again 5 minutes before my soul in a bowl arrived. No explanation or reasoning as to why things were not brought to us at the same time. Really no customer service from this waitress whatsoever."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place to have breakfast.  But vegans beware because every item in this menu has an egg in it!  

Overeasy Breakfast Ltd is a very attractive chic breakfast journey.  The place is so delightfully done up in red and yellow chairs, stools that look kind of like eggs, retro graphics on the walls and overhead lamps illuminating the words Overeasy.

This is definitely an Edmonton Trail gem. Fresh farm eggs are used in every meal and there is tons to choose from, your basic any way you like it eggs, Egg Omelettes, Benny styles and my personal favourite Crepes and French Toast. And for those of you watching your figure, there is a light menu and an executive menu. 

But it doesn't stop here, not only does it serve up fruit juices and coffee; there is even wine and beer. For breakfast you say? Why not cure that hang over; it is always best to drink an alcoholic beverage the next day for breakfast anyways. 

This is a unique breakfast outlet that is worth checking out and I am not yolking!

Closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"OK... After reading many amazing reviews for OEB Breakfast, today was the day.  I have to say fellow Yelpers, you nailed it!  

After a GPS guided drive, I finally found it, and parking nearby was easy.  I walked in and to my suprise, at 930 am on a Wednesday morning, the place was PACKED!  Good sign #1.  I was sat at the communal \"high rise\" table in the middle of the room.  Looking around at what others were digging into, I was beyond excited to try this place!  I am from Halifax, NS.  A good friend and former head chef of mine packed it in with the fine dining scene, working 16 hours a day, no social life, etc.  He opened a breakfast joint called Coastal Coffee in Halifax.  OEB had the same vibe.  Small, casual, trendy, and most importantly, CHEF DRIVEN!  You can always tell the places opened by a passionate chef.

My server came over, started with a coffee and let me have about 5 minutes with the menu.  I knew he was a foodie, we had a good chat about the Tamworth Hog with butchers cuts tattoo I have on my forearm.  I asked for his recommendation of what to get.  I decided on a \"breakfast box\"  Basically, breakfast poutine.  I was leaning towards the scallops, but I am a sucker for a good duck confit.  He said without a doubt, go for the scallops!  So I did.

I waited about 10 minutes, then saw a server coming with a Chinese take out box on a plate.  I was ravenous for this.  She sat it in front of me and already I knew THIS is my new breakfast place!  THE breakfast place!

I was presented with duck fat fried potatoes, topped with 2 PERFECTLY poached eggs, 2 large PERFECTLY cooked scallops, crispy bacon lardons, cheese curds and browned butter hollandaise.  My inner chef did his happy dance.  

There were 2 ingredients in this dish, that if cooked incorrectly,can easily ruin a dish.  First off, there is nothing sexier than a medium poached egg.  Yes, getting down to sexiness here people, 18+ to keep reading.  The way you poke it with your fork, the softness, almost bounce back texture of it, now cut into it, oooohhh yea, there is that delicious yolk covering the duck fat potatoes and bacon...mmmm..yea, that's the way I like it, but I digress.  Secondly, scallops.  There is no greater culinary sin to commit, than to overcook Digby scallops.  They should be rare, medium at most.  A nice hard sear on one side, quick turn to the other side and that's it!  Stop cooking now!  Overcooked scallops are rubbery, and disappointing.  Forget spilled milk, overcooked scallops make people cry.

OK, back to breakfast.  The flavors combined in this box in front of me worked amazingly well together.  The duck fat potatoes, well they were cooked in duck fat, enough said.  They were delicious.  Scallops and bacon are best of friends, so that was a home run, and a runny poached egg with hollandaise sauce and melty cheese curds wrapped it all up.  I devoured the dish, and it wasn't until I got to the end of the dish that I finally felt \"WOW is this ever rich!\"  Of course it is, but it was so very good that I fought my way through the last few yolk covered potatoes.

The ONLY thing that I couldn't personally figure out, were the eggs.  They were called poached, but appeared to be boiled, or in a steamer mold.  Not sure, maybe this chef just topped my culinary knowledge and blew my mind with his eggs.  

Food, amazing.  Service, perfect.  So, Yelpers, GO TO OEB BREAKFAST!  I personally guarantee your satisfaction."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! although busy, this is a must try! I love to try all the Box-D - my fav is A lott a Lox since I like smoked salmon"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and stopped in for breakfast this morning. We were not disappointed! The restaurant itself is very cute and nicely decorated. The ambience fits. It is small but they utilize an app No Wait that allows you to join the waitlist remotely and then they tell you how long until your table is ready so you know when to arrive. This is genius and more places need to use it! Other than that, and most importantly, the menu is extensive and unique, and the food was DELICIOUS!! All of the food sounded amazing and we loved our meals. I got the lobster and shrimp crepe and my husband had the Benny that has duck on it. Really, SO GOOD. The ingredients taste very fresh and the portion sizes are gigantic. On top of all of that, the service is fantastic and every employee we interacted with was kind and helpful. We will definitely stop in again when we are back in Calgary!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Calgary. It's consistent and theres always something on the menu for everyone. My favourites are the classic breakfast,  crepes, the one that did not get away and the benedicts. Best hollandaise in the city!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast restaurant in the city.  The wait is usually long for a reason and it's worth it.  My sister and I wanted to do a quick lunch so we were able to get a table at 11:15 on a weekday.  The Nowait app didn't have a line.  We both ordered and got our meals in less than 10 minutes. It only took a total of 45 minutes for our meal.  We ordered the Lots of Lox Waffle and the Upstream Benny. Both meals were tasty as always. I really enjoy the hollandaise.  This restaurant is really consistent.   If you want to order to-go; it only takes about seven minutes for them to cook your meal."}
{"text":"Totally worth the 30-45 min wait if you go there on a weekend for brunch !
This was one of the best brunches I have had in Calgary. The staff were very pleasant and professional, and everything was quite yummy!
A pleasant experience, you should try it."}
{"text":"The orange yolks are so rich and thick and goopy, just the way I like 'em. It seems like the eggs came from happy/healthy chickens, hopefully at least.

I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes to get a table but brunch here is definitely worth the wait. The coffee and (sometimes) banana bread keep me happy, it doesn't hurt when it's a beautiful sunny morning. There isn't too much waiting space inside so the wait when it's cold out isn't the most pleasant."}
{"text":"I was really happy with this restaurant. Following the advice of another reviewer, I I used the nowait app, got \"in line\" at 8:45am, as we wanted to eat at 10am. When I finally arrived, I was 8th in line and only had to wait 30 minutes for a table! 

I had the buckwheat crêpe. It was huge and delicious! I took 1/2 of it home!

So, get the app, use it and then enjoy a great meal after only a short wait!"}
{"text":"I have always loved OEB  and their new location is great. It is much larger and has a lot more seating available and the decor is really nice, it has a open happy feel to it. I do use the Nowait app to see their wait times and put myself in line.

OEB is one of the best places to get brunch/breakfast in Calgary, they have quality food, great service and their menu has so much to choose from. My favourite is the Confit duck and eggs and it comes with perogies! so good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Can't hate anything about it! But get there before the early bird because the line is killer for this place; and for good reason."}
{"text":"Love the Upsteam eggs Benedict ... My fav. Also love the wait list and texting technology behind the reservation."}
{"text":"I heard lots of good things about this place from colleagues. So came here for their brunch on a working Thursday with a colleague. We both ordered the same thing. I got the water fowl (noble duck. Nobleford AB)... Smoked Peking duck breast. porcini mushroom-truffle ragu in egg benny style with potatoes wedge.   WOW.  It sounded so delicious and yes it was delicious. The duck breast meat was not placed on top of the egg benny. But it was placed on the side of the dish. The plate was huge and made the food look like not enough. But it was actually lots of food. Very filling. 

The décor was really interesting and nice. The entire restaurant revolved around the idea of egg. Pretty cool décor. 

Service was nice as well. I highly recommend this place. Its a thumbs up. 

Also remember to come early. The place fills up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Over the Easter weekend, my friends and I decided to try out a new restaurant for brunch. We weren't in the mood to visit a chain restaurant so we turned to our common friend, Google, to help us in finding a restaurant nearby. 
We randomly chose \"OEB Breakfast Co.\" and drove there. After spending fifteen minutes or so looking for parking and another thirty minutes in the queue to be seated, we were ready to be served. Our hostess was polite and funny. I ordered the \"Croque Madame\", while my friends ordered, \"The one that got away\" and \"The salmon Crepe\". The quantity was perfect and the food was delectable. I honestly think it took longer to be seated than for the food to arrive after we ordered. 
Overall, I had a positive and lasting impression of OEB and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I saw so many reviews complained about the service here I don't get it. All the girls are so nice every time I have brunch here. Yes the line is a bit crazy especially even on a weekday but it's worth it. At least it's worth the Confit Duck & Eggs because that's the one thing I always end up ordering. Yes it's that good, the bacon is just a little too salty though"}
{"text":"Greaaat service, great tasting healthy food. Interesting menue with a variety of breakfast choices."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of hype about OEB and decided to check it out.

After waiting outside in the cold for nearly 45 minutes to get in I entered and washed my frost bitten hands and was squeezed into a corner table.

We were served fairly quickly and I have to say the food was amazing, however the size of the restaurant was cramped and not welcoming to be in.

Sadly businesses like this who claim to be ' the best ' and never expand beyond a hole in the wall really don't make me want to eat there.

Foods Great, Location isn't."}
{"text":"Great decor, great food,  nice servers, a little pricey.

I recognize that a lot of their food is grain fed, free range, locally grown, and can read you a bed time story if you ask it, but it's still expensive. 

I had a hamburger and my husband had something that looked like steak, but I actually wasn't paying attention to what he was eating because I was too hungry, and caught up in the story my burger was telling me about that time it was in the war. 

Good to check out, but not on my list of cheap eats, that's for sure. The decor is VERY well done.

Also, don't absentmindedly order an orange juice when you sit down, because you'll be emptying your pockets of a cool $4.60 - twenty cents less than a full smoothie."}
{"text":"Double breakfast date with the boys and J. Waited 45 minutes and we were all getting grumpy and it was a cold day. I did not know the protocol, stand in line, get your name on the list crunch like sardines in the front door, and worry about fire codes.....and it was early enough that parking wasn't easy and waiting was not fun.....BUT

Yum. Potatoes in duck fat. 

That is all.

You shouldn't go. That would only make my wait longer.

Possibly the most phenomenal breakfast i have ever eaten.

Next time cheesecake for breakfast."}
{"text":"It was a great place to eat. I'd definitely go back. Go early for a table. Fills up fast."}
{"text":"Had my first experience with OEB and I have to say I loved it. Popped in over lunch with some work buddies. First off, these guys are tech forward as they're on the NoWait app, which is a huge deal cause apparently they're always busy. NoWait enables you to reserve tables using their app. Already a big fan right there.

Their menu was a smorgasbord of everything I like for breakfast, but I had been pre-sold on their \"Soul in a Bowl\" so that was what I had. The only way to describe it would be an eggs benedict poutine. Absolutely awesome. If I had any complaints it would be the price. For lunch it's ok. Dinner - fine. But I'm cheap, so I can see myself making this a treat place. But you know what, that's perfectly fine. I think the charm in a place like OEB is that it's not somewhere you should go every day. So now when I've earned it, I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Who would open an expensive high end breakfast place during a downturn in corporate downtown Calgary in the middle of a sterile, box shaped, glass office tower with no parking? - answer: Hipsters!  I love this place. I work 30 floors above and every day it full from open to close.

Its nice you can make a reservation compared to other places that seem to think a line up for an hour makes them more desirable. The menu is massive, overwhelming and somewhat confusing so just ask your server for some advice.

The service is fantastic, the food is outstanding, the meals come out very quickly even with a large group, its a bit noisy but that is because it is always crazy busy, the coffee is exceptional."}
{"text":"Did I actually just get charged $20 for 1 pancake, 2 eggs(cooked wrong), and 3 pieces of bacon?! I thought it came with hash browns as well, but nope I had to order those separate. (fYI they are potato wedges, not hash browns. The same as you get at Tim Hortons) There you have it. A basic no frills breakfast for just under $30.00 with tip. It's actually so outrageous that it's funny."}
{"text":"If you love eggs as much as I do this is the place to be. Eggs to me are a way of life, and in our household we seriously eat over a dozen per week. OEB has perfected the egg craft, and there is no place I'd rather brunch at. Every egg that comes out of that kitchen is cooked to perfection. You cannot go wrong with the menu. 

I'm a huge fan of eggs Benedict and they have so many savory varieties to choose from. If you want in on this great place I recommend using No Wait (an app) to get in line while you're still at home because on weekends this place can take 1-2 hours to get into. 

Because they are so busy sometimes the service can be a little slow, but if you're brunching what's the rush!? 

To anyone visiting you have to check this place out, for anyone that lives here you haven't lived properly if you haven't dined here for brunch!"}
{"text":"I now know why this place has been rated as a top breakfast place in Calgary! My oh my is this place great! Granted we had to wait a little over 30 minutes for a table (we probably should have gotten our butts out of bed a tad earlier) it was well worth the wait! Holy mackerel does this place fill up fast - the line is out the door, although there isn't a lot of space to wait inside. Once we were finally seated we ordered some delectable breakfast! My Eggs Benedict - I'm fairly certain I always order this - was fantastic! I devoured it, although part of me wishes I had slowed down a bit so I could savour how delicious it truly was. 

I love the name of this place, it's very clever! The decor inside and the atmosphere is eclectic, it almost feels like you're at home in your kitchen, which is exactly what I think they're going for! They have so many option on the menu, it's hard to chose what to get! The quality of this food rivals almost every breakfast place I've been to in Calgary and believe me that's a lot - I love my breakfast! 

I know there is some negativity on this place being so cramped, and at times I'm not going to lie, I did feel like a little bit of a sardine, but at the same time the food and staff made up for it 100% 

*Note: they do not accept credit cards, so ensure you have cash or debit - this is one thing I would have the owner put up on a sign as you walk in."}
{"text":"My very first adventure into the restaurant food world of Calgary brought me here to OEB. Actually it took me a few days following the visit to realize that OEB stands for \"Over Easy Breakfast\". I guess it makes sense considering every imaginable egg option on their menu is some kind of \"undercooked\". It's a good think I love eggs this way.

I ordered one of the \"Box'd\" menu items - the Meat-less to Say...with meat. My girlfriend got the \"Menage a Trois\" with scrambled eggs instead of over-easy. The waiter did a great job of recommending things on the menu for us out-of-towners. He even offered to serve my box'd item in a bowl. I recommend doing this because it would be hard to work with otherwise. There were two incredible poached eggs that you should just break right into and let soak into the entire contents of the bowl. Underneath the delicious layers of meat, cheese and avocado is a probably an entire potato sliced in wedges. It was more than I could stomach in one sitting. My girlfriend loved the fresh fruit and giant piece of French toast.

Service wasn't bad. Our server was helpful but most other staff were not especially friendly. Maybe I'm just coming to realize that friendliness with strangers isn't so common outside of the southeastern US. Prices also aren't bad considering the amount of food you get. The restaurant layout is a bit tight. When you sit at the end of the high table in the middle you will feel like you're constantly in the way. On the ceiling they have a chalkboard where some artiste on staff has drawn the name of many of the most popular dishes on the menu. That's pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Went there for Father's Day breakfast. Eggs were great. How can you not like fries done in duck fat. Really appreciated the Nowait  app they use. Minimal wait time outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Can you eat out at awesome food joints that have all manner of goodies on their menu and still control yourself? As much as I wanted to indulge in some of the yumminess that kept jumping out of the menu at me, I was a decently good girl at breaky today. 

A Sunday mid-day meal at OEB proved to be a busy time to hit up this local breakfast joint. We were there a bit early to secure a table for six or so of us. And while we waited, banana bread and coffee kept finding its way to us at the end of the line. Yay! 

There were five of us that popped in for a table of six. A couple of moments later, two more joined our party... oh my, 7! Easy, peasy. OEB's staff was on top of it with an extra chair for the table before we could say \"sunny-side up.\"

My breakfast was simple. Two overeasy eggs, two maple pork sausages, some potato wedges, toast and a glass of orange juice. My toast wasn't even buttered. I got to decide how much/little went onto those slices myself. That's a nice touch OEB. Even with a busy Sunday morning, there was no wait for our food. It all came out relatively quickly and at the same time. 

The smoothies at the other end of the table looked pretty yummy. I'm gonna need to try me one of them next time! And the orange juice I had? The menu says it's a fresh juice... I hope it was squeezed 30 seconds before coming to my table for the $4 I paid for a small glass. 

The staff impressed me, manoeuvering through such a tightly packed space, never bumping a chair or spilling a meal from what I could see. And always on the ball. That can't be easy. Also nice was that our bills came pre-split at the end of the meal.

Breakfast might be expensive, but I feel like there are a lot of extras built in. When I'm done being 'good' I'm so coming back for a plate of the Super Moist French Toast I saw sitting in front of Kaeleigh-and a Morning Glory."}
{"text":"Love love going here for breakfast with my friends !  
I have ate at the place on Edmonton trail several times and wanted to try this one on 4th Street.  Met up with a gang of girl pals and we had an awesome time!  Food was terrific and we felt spoiled by the great service and tasty dishes we ordered!  If you go on a weekend, use the No Wait App so we got our table at a specific time .  I felt sorry for all the people lined up trying to snag a spot and watching all the delicious food being served.
Only problem was circling around the block & area trying to find a parking spot!  Stressful & not fun if you have a large car.
But the delicious food made up for it.  I've had the Soul in a Bowl ( goodness in a chinese takeout box), upstream Benny ( smoked salmon bennies... looked so awesome) and the Breakfast in Tuscany ( so yummy)!
You can't go wrong - all the food looked awesome & tasty sooooo great!  You may never go back to a Denny's or Humptys after this!"}
{"text":"So I had never heard of this little gourmet gem until the Restaurant Review segment on CBC aired a review of OEB Friday morning, 5 weeks ago. 
I love breakfast. And I enjoy going to high end establishments to little diners to get my breakfast on.  But I also like a good quality breakfast with excellent coffee in an upbeat atmosphere with good service. 
OEB has it all.  I was able to enjoy a cappuccino with my boxed breakfast of lox and crispy potatoes smothered in a lovely hollandaise sauce adorned with generous bites of cheese curds. 
The menu is extensive and there's lots to choose from when it comes to quality gourmet breakfast. It's not your ordinary flapjack and links place. You get to choose from items that you've always wanted to explore and enjoy but never knew where to get them in an unassuming and fun place. 
The service was good and attentive and I do like the location of the OEB downtown. 

You need to get there early. When my boyfriend and I got there at 7:57 on a Sunday morning, 3 other people were waiting to get in.... by 8:2O the place was 3/4 seated and I can't imagine what it looks like come 9:30am!

Great place to get your breaky on!"}
{"text":"I had just moved to Calgary and breakfast is my favorite time to eat. I'd Googled another breakfast joint on Edmonton Trail, hopped on a bus, and my search began with much anticipation. Long story short, I was unsuccessful in my search and was growing rather frustrated when I found myself in front Overeasy. (And I've never looked back)

Just walking into the intimate restaurant brings a breath of fresh air -and the delicious smells of pancakes, toast, hollandaise sauce, and  aromatic coffee as servers pass by.


Part of the ceiling has cleverly been converted into a black board covered with all kinds of colorful words and phrases about the best meal of the day. The walls are totally retro and the bar in the middle of the restaurant (Which I think is the best place to sit) has funky cactus looking at you as you enjoy your stay.

The food is A1! Colorful, delicious, and incredibly priced. $20 can easily get you an amazing breakfast with coffee and enough to leave a decent gratuity for the much deserving, friendly serving staff.

It's true that one can bee seen rubbing shoulders with other's during the weekends; but with such a fun, positive environment and a great meal in front of you, who really minds?"}
{"text":"Worth the hype! As the king of Calgary breakfast places (and long lines) I expected big things and OEB delivered. Extensive menu where you'll want to try everything but for my first time I had the holy crab eggs benny. Good dungeness crab flavor, not too heavy of a hollandaise sauce (my biggest pet peeve), really good duck fat hash browns,  and I have absolutely no complaints. If there's at all a good reason to wake up at an ungodly hour on a Sunday, it's OEB."}
{"text":"Soul 'n a bowl! OMG! Was yummy ... put me in a food coma! a good food coma! hahah.

But booo to waffles being ONE waffle and paying extra for whip cream and basically paying like $15 for one waffle - haha."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great staff, well worth the wait!

The Box'd breakfasts are a playful take on poutine. The Meat-less to Say was a delicious poached egg (doneness of the egg is up to you) topped with brown butter hollandaise sauce, served with avocado, tomatoes, cheese curds, served on a bed of thick cut fries. I loved the presentation of the dish. 

Presentation of the other dishes are also great! The Chunky Lobster Scramble comes with lots of big pieces of lobster - very unexpected for a breakfast joint. 

The service was great and the staff were really friendly, helpful, and patient. Although they were busy, the waitress took the time to cover the comprehensive menu - front and back! 

The wait time can be long, but it is well worth it. They offer free coffee while you wait. To keep you up-to-date, they offer an app that lets you see where you are in line."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary for the first time en route to Banff/Lake Louise, we relied on YELP to give us a great start to our vacation.  OEB was a great find, except for the wait.  The eggs benedict with slow cooked pork belly was just melt in your mouth delicious.  What a great combination with perfectly cooked to order poached eggs.  Yummmm!   Duck confit & dumplings and their waffles are great too.  The potatoes fried in duck fat does taste better.  Not a low cal breakfast, but very satisfying with creative options. so only indulge once in a while.  (Easy for us since we live in SF)  Wish we had thought of parking across the street instead of the paid lot next door.  Oh well, now you know."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Nice interior and good food. Benny with salmon is their must try dish!"}
{"text":"This is the first time to visit this location. Foods is good but I like the old shop more... people more friendly in the old location."}
{"text":"Soul in a bowl to die for! Service is great, my friend with 2 kids loved her server she was attentive to her kids needs, bringing side plates and small cups! I love the organic coffee strong just how I like it. Close to work."}
{"text":"Breakfast was absolutely amazing here. I had the Arty-choked preserva, eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly, all the flavours were really good together, what can I say, I was impressed. My husband was really happy with what he had as well!"}
{"text":"OEB Breakfast Co is located in Edmonton Trail NE.  There is street parking, as well as park and pay right beside but why not just park a block away and walk a little instead of paying! 

I FINALLY got to try OEB on my day off on a Friday.  Last time I tried to go on a weekend and the line was overflowing outside so I figured on a usual work day AM it shouldn't be SOOO busy.  I picked this place from all the crazy good reviews.

When we walked into OEB my first thoughts was \"Wow, this place is sooo cute!\"  I guess this place is a pretty big hit because it was totally packed.  There was a couple ahead of us so we had to wait a few minutes but I was more than happy to wait.

When we got seated, we were greeted by a verrry nice lady.  She took our drink order and let us take our time to look at the big menu.  The first thing I noticed was that their eggs are free run, large, dark yolk, omega 3 and the potatoes are cooked in organic duck fat.  I went straight to the breakfast poutine \"Soul in a bowl\".  I've heard so many good reviews about it so I knew for sure I wanted to give that a try...but I was also craving avocado.  The lady suggested I get the Soul in a bowl but instead of bacon, I can get avocado and riped tomatoes.  So I did go with the avocado and tomato soul in the bowl..and added bacon.  My friend went with the Spanish style pork chorizo which is air cured - fennel chorizo, green onions, bell peppers & field mushrooms with a side of potatoes.

When our meals arrive, I was like WOW!  My soul in the bowl was in a what looked like a chinese take out container, pretty neat!!  Medium poached eggs on top, fresh fried potatoes with avocado, riped tomatoes, cheese curds and hollandaise sauce!! My first bite was phenomenal.  I usually like ketchup with my potatoes but they were seasoned so well I didn't need anything.  The medium poached eggs were great and the cheese was melted inside.  It was just so tasty!!!!  My girlfriend said the Spanish style pork chorizo was really good, it came with toast and fresh fruit too!  She mentioned there was lots of flavor and she was a fan of the potatoes as well.

The menu at OEB is huge!  There is so much, you probably won't be able to decide on just one thing.  The staff is very friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is chill and you've got to try the soul in a bowl asap!

I will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best eggs benny I've ever had. Simple but done amazingly well."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a sad experience here at OEB watching a dead skunk and it's scattered organs getting scraped up off the road.  Poor, misunderstood creature.

But my three-egg scram-blette was great.  Just what I needed on that chilly Calgary morning."}
{"text":"I love OEB!!! It's one of my favourite brunch places in Calgary and I love how they have 3 locations now!! The lobster crepe is my go-to dish since it is so filling. Service is always attentive and they do not rush you out of the door even if the waiting line is long. 

Make sure to download the No Wait app so you can get on the wait list before you leave your house!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast you'll ever eat! Delicious concoctions and sauces. Save room for dessert! Their waffles and french toasts are to die for. But also save time. The wait is usually 2 hours. Why they don't open another location, is an excellent question."}
{"text":"OEB was always a super high quality and delicious breakfast joint, and now it exists in a location to match. It's now spacious and not insane to find a seat! The menu looked identical, which is fine. There's so many amazing things to try, almost too many! Seriously, it can be overwhelming trying to choose from the dozens of options. It's a blessing a delicious curse, really.

Take the new location as an excuse to hit up OEB, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. Very wide choice on menu, plenty non traditional. The potatos are cooked in duck fat - divine!  Very friendly service. Get there early as lines form quickly for good reason."}
{"text":"I haven't been since the reno's. 

It used to be pretty crowded but the food was good. Line ups to get in are long and there is nowhere to stand and wait, other than outside. 

Book using the Opentable app. If you book in the morning (6) you should be able to get in by 11."}
{"text":"This place had a great vibe and the food was good, but everything was cooked in Fat and very fancy. The most normal item they had were waffles, which I selected. They were very tasty! If you want a classic Benny, or an omelette this place is not for you. Very long lines! Super cramped and gets very hot! The servers were awesome and very friendly:)"}
{"text":"Warnings: 
1. OEB only accepts cash or debit
2. You need to download an app called NoWait and get in a weird virtual line that has a very inaccurate time estimate (don't be afraid if it says 3 hours, it is not actually going to be that long) 
3. You will want to eat everything on the menu because it is all so delicious!! I usually go with their famous breakfast poutine, which is an amazing concoction of crispy fried potatoes, poached eggs, creamy hollandaise, and various toppings. This past time I got the truffled butternut squash with poached eggs and it was sooo good and now creates a great dilemma for me about whether or not to keep getting their poutine or try the rest of their menu. Their coffee drinks have also never disappointed. I also love that they source their eggs from their own egg farm and the eggs are free range. OEB is one of my favorite brunch places in Calgary and more than worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Still thinking about the twice fried potatoes in duck fat. Seriously, this place is worth every clogged artery. I got the tuna crudo box (it came in a bowl) upon the recommendation of my friendly waitress, who says that they sell out of those super fast. Honestly, though, it doesn't look like you can go wrong with any choice. I would have eaten any of those happily!

The tuna is generously cut, super fresh, and complemented the seasoned waffle fries perfectly. The eggs were medium poached, which was perfect for spreading the runny yolk all over the dish. I recommend asking for half spinach/half potatoes, because it's a LOT of potatoes and you kinda crave something green after all that delicious duck fat. 

I can't comment on the wait, because I came at 7 AM on a Monday lol. I was seated and served super fast, so it seems like weekdays are the way to do it."}
{"text":"Great food, my favourite breakfast place in Calgary, but the wait is always so long, last year the staff was mentioning they will move to a bigger location by May 2015 but nothing yet. definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the 70's music seemed just right, and I agree with everyone who told me this is one of the very best breakfast diners in Calgary. Superb, all round."}
{"text":"OEB has always been a staple to Calgarian locals for Sunday brunch. We have decided to revisit the restaurant this week to have another taste of their succulent dishes. A word of advice: Waiting for a table at OEB on Sunday morning is like watching the ads before a movie, long and dreadful. However, there is a solution OEB has come up with, which works decently if your timing is right. They are part of a phone app called NoWait, which allows you to put yourself in line at home. Best thing, I find, is to queue yourself in line before the morning routine. That way, there isn't really much wait by the time you are at the front doors.

Environment - Aside from the atrocious long waiting times (which can be avoided: see above), the place is constantly bustling with chatter and servers attending customers. Brunch is meant to bring people together and the atmosphere at OEB feels cheerful, lively, and sociable. The only negative thing is the size of OEB. We felt cramped with the place constantly at full capacity.

Food - Outstanding. The restaurant really takes it to heart when they say \"you always eat with your eyes first.\" The presentation for each dish is always attractive and appealing to the eyes. The duck breast benny was great from start to finish. Everything was fresh and complimented each other well. It was truly a great dish to start the day off with. The Box'd dish..... The only imperfection about the dish was the portion ratio. I felt it was very heavy on potatoes in relation to the other ingredients and felt myself turning into a potato.

Value - OEB is modest in their pricing. Prices are typical of brunch but the quality of food is higher than what is reflected in the price.

Overall - Fantastic place for brunch. You get great food pleasing both to the eyes and the palate without breaking your bank. If only OEB wasn't so popular."}
{"text":"Was very convenient to reserve online and lineup ahead of time.  This place is very busy and lively.  
We had a egg in the box scallops and a duck in the box; the lady had a lobster crepe.  The food and taste, I would of given 5 stars compared to the competition.  
But I feel there are areas for improvement for the egg in the box.  The presentation is great! and it taste very fresh.  But the potatoes under the eggs are too generous.  Gives me the feeling 85% of my meal is potatoes.  With an offer for a potato substitute or combination of other ingredients might please more customers."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a menu that confused you like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck played Elmer Fudd .. Rabbit season ! No Duck Season ! No Rabbit season !
The menu is extensive creative and very inviting. The food tastes as good as it is described in the menu and the service was great. It is also very nice to have a Latte that tastes good with one's breakfast for a change! We went there for a week day breakfast meeting. We had the salmon and the Duck eggs Benedict.
I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite breakfast place in Calgary. My \"usual\" is Soul-In-A-Bowl, but basically everything there is a winner. The only drawback is often the wait time, but even that won't take away the fifth star. 

Be prepared to go for a wander and come back or grab an Americano at Diner Deluxe (yep, I don't care if that's blasphemous) and sit outside until your table is called. 

I simply can't say enough about the quality of the ingredients, the artistry of the presentation and the balance of flavours available to you at OEB. It's downright sinful."}
{"text":"I gets down with OEB! Hands down, this has to be my favourite brunch spot in the city; allow me the chance to explain why

1. Soul in a Bowl: Whenever I describe OEB's breakfast poutine to friends, family and random strangers on the street most feel this is the most innovative breakfast offering since Lucky Charms. More recently they have taken the Soul in the Bowl to the next level by adding multiple variations. Much like fishing in your bowl of cereal for rainbow shaped marshmallows, you will be searching for Lucky Charms of a different sort such as pork belly, smoked salmon and scallops served a'top Duck-fat fried breakfast potatoes, Quebec curds and a rich Hollandaise sauce. Get me a napkin; I'm salivating just thinking about it!

2. I love Lox: The steelhead smoked salmon at OEB is some of the best lox I have had in my life. They can't do any wrong with it. Place it on a piece of cardboard and sprinkle some dirt on it, I'd probably ask for seconds.

3. Eggy Goodness: If you're calling your business Over Easy, you better know how to make an egg right to order. I haven't been disappointed yet with their egg-doneness. If you want your egg a little runny, they will nail it for you no sweat. Next time I'm going to keep them on their toes and ask for my eggs in a crème brule.

4. Massive Menu Keeps Everyone Happy: Serious, it's huge! They have something for everyone whether you have a bit of a sweet tooth, are a vegetarian or a carnivore. It's kid friendly as well so bring your young ones.


It's not uncommon to have to wait a while to get a table during the weekends, but it's always been worth the wait. Just ask the host for a cup of coffee and sit out front and watch the world pass by until your table is ready! The service is outstanding every time and is worth a little extra gratuity when you pay for the bill. The interior is very small but I find it to be quite cozy. Go to OEB!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning and we loved it. We shared the Boston cream pie French toast and a Lobster scramble bowl dish (I'm blanking on the exact name) anyway, the food was delicious and the service was wonderful. I think because we are from LA and aren't used to people being so friendly!  Canadians in general are such nice people. Just make sure you use their app and check in ahead of time cause the wait is long, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"The last three times I went I ordered \"Benny Sends Me\" (Egg Benedict). But I do not like the potatoes that come with the dish as they are a bit cold & hard; and do not enjoy the fruits since they are not sweet and sometimes sour. 

So I tried the Confit De Canard BOX'D yesterdays since the menu does not say there's potatoes; but unfortunately, half of the box was potatoes...

The only one thing that makes me to go back is to enjoy the Buttermilk Griddle Cake. They are very good - crispy and soft!

The wait time is always long. Line up for table, washroom and to pay. If arriving there after 11:00, then have to wait at least 30min."}
{"text":"We had almost an hour wait (arrived at 11:20am) but it was well worth the wait. The food came out quickly and we were ready to pay within 35mins of sitting down.

I tried the lobster and shrimp crepe with hollandaise sauce and it was delicious!! My friend had \"the threesome\" (no kidding! Eggs, sausages and waffles) and enjoyed that as well. For desert we had the French toast trifle and it was hands down one of the best desserts I've ever had. 

A must visit for someone living in Calgary especially in the NE. I'll definitely visit this place again for brunch the next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 5/5

This place gets busy! Make reservations and use the NoWait app to track where you are in line. 

The décor is modern and trendy with natural wood and light. We sat at the communal bar table (bonus points for including bag hooks underneath). Service is thumbs up. 

Hogs & Scallops ($18) - poached eggs, seared scallops, bacon, cheese curds, crisp potatoes, and brown butter Hollandaise.
This comes in a Chinese take-out container with the bottom packed with home style fries and layered with the toppings listed above. Could use more bacon. 

Truffled Squash ($14) - poached eggs, butternut squash puree, crisp potatoes, fresh fruit, brown butter Hollandaise.
The butternut squash was delicious and flavourful! 

French Toast Trifle ($14) - organic blood orange curd, season fresh berries, pistachios and baked meringue. 
Soft and chewy French toast with tons of berries loaded on top. The baked meringue was light, fluffy and not too sweet. Definitely recommend this dish if you're looking to end a savoury breakfast with something sweet."}
{"text":"Love this place! We here recently and had a box'd it was delicious. 
They have the most extensive menu for breakfast it's fantastic. 
They cater fantasy for gluten free"}
{"text":"The decor is great as was the service, food presentation and cappuccino (no added ingredients necessary!).  However, the prices are shockingly high for a few items and when it's at full capacity, the restaurant is much too crowded.  I could barely squeeze between chairs to get to the restroom, which felt like a refrigerator, by the way. 

I had the Rise & Shine Three Egg Scram-blette.  The herbed potatoes were delicious, the toast was good and served with whipped butter on the side.  The fruit serving was generous but the issue was the scram-blette itself.  It seemed very salty and the chicken was very overdone, therefore dry and hard.  My spouse had the Spanish style pork chorizo scram-blette.  He enjoyed most of his meal too but also noted the sausage was very overdone and hard to cut.

At the end of the day, I'd recommend that if you want to reduce or avoid waiting and overcrowding, go on a weekday.  I will return to try another meal and it certainly won't be on a weekend as it then turns into the same experience as many of the other busy breakfast joints.  I definitely enjoyed aspects of my outing here with other Yelpers, but it wasn't good enough to get overly excited about.  I kind of miss the inexpensive menu and low-key atmosphere that this restaurant used to have."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Calgary, original dishes, great service always impressed."}
{"text":"It has been some time since I was in Bridgeland for a meal. Had an opportunity to hit this place today and was not disappointed. I had an omelette loaded with veggies and fresh feta cheese. Side was an arugula salad so was perfect for my gluten free keto requirements. There was no question in them being able to accommodate the dietary requirements with food that was outstanding. 

The place has a very relaxed and cool vibe, no rushing here. OEB makes you feel right at home, like you are in their kitchen have breakfast. Look forward to coming back."}

{"text":"Went here after dropping my grandfather off at the airport. It was an early morning and we decided we would attempt heading out for breakfast in Calgary.  If you are a foodie you know that going out for breakfast in this place can be very frustrating because of lineups.

We brought our six-year-old with us as well, I managed to claim a seat before 8 AM at the little bar located in the middle of the restaurant.

The menu looked really good however, there were no vegan or vegetarian options available here. I managed to find something that was like a giant Boccinccini cheese sandwich For myself. The cheese was just overpowering in terms of texture and flavor for the sandwich, they could've save some money and used less cheese and more pesto. But it was a good idea.

DH had a Benny which he said was good we ordered the chocolate chip pancakes for the little one.

Coffee was very strong, we also ordered a smoothie however I didn't try it out.

Staff was nice and the service is pretty quick. Some people did bring in screaming children which wasn't very fun but I'm not sure that restaurants here are all about kicking screaming kids out.

I wouldn't go back again because there wasn't much for me to eat, but there were a lot of interesting menu items I think people should try if they are up for it. It's also open really early so it makes it easier to get in without being frustrated by lineups."}
{"text":"Waited a insane amount of time. Despite using the app, we waited an additional 35 minutes. My son and I got shuffled to a table along the window. Was overall good. But when a staff member opened a cupboard, I saw stacks of powdered Hollandaise sauce...?"}
{"text":"I like that you can get perfect poached eggs and hollandaise and other stuff served on either spinach or fried potatoes... for whatever mood you're in.
Sometimes there's a line, but that's because the food kicks ass. and even if it's busy, the food is always perfectly executed."}
{"text":"Had the traditional #Benny
First time having #EggsBenedict!
Marvelous!
@OEB_Breakfast"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Calgary! Everything I have ever tried is absolutely delicious and fresh. My favorite is 'Soul in a Bowl' with avocados and ripe tomatoes, yum yum! 

The service is quick and friendly, and my coffee is refilled often. I have been to breakfast places all over the city and this is the one I always come back to!"}
{"text":"This place and Diner Deluxe next door is great for people who are looking to get  a wholesome breakfast, brunch, lunch or breakfast-anytime. If one is full, check out the other. Either way you'll get a hearty meal. 

OEB is definitely the smaller venue of the two. The difference isn't much but its popularity can mean some waiting outside on the benches. Not recommended in the Calgarian winter."}
{"text":"Went here based on fellow yelp reviews and waited an hour. And, besides for the people sitting next to us talking so so loudly it was a delightful experience! I had the lobster and shrimp crepe with bacon added per the suggestion of our waitress. It was delicious. I liked the bacon separate because nothing is every to sweet for me! :) we also had the breakfast pouting which was good but nothing to write home about. I didn't love the orange juice either-good but too expensive. This is definitely a place I would come back to and recommend to others. I would put myself on the waitlist before arriving though because they were doing construction in the building and it sounded like a rhinoceros getting a root canal. ;)"}
{"text":"I love it here! It's been so long since I've been here and I'm so happy I finally got to go back. The food is always on point and the menu changes every once and a while so you can always expect to try something new. I find that whenever I go there, I over-order, but you know what? It's always worth it! I've tried various things on the menu but always remember to order a pancake. It's pretty much a must when you are there! It's either my boyfriend or I that orders a version of the Soul in a Bowl and it never fails. Personally, I really like the gold digga! But they did have a version today that included scallops, so I ordered the gold digga with a side of scallops. Haha. Worth it! 

It's really hard to recommend when you should head on over as its always busy. Be prepared to wait for the most part. We've recommended this place to our friends and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about the arugula salad.  OMG, had the eggs, 2 bangers and salad for breakfast, 2 times there now.  It doesn't get old and it's delicious.  The sausages are chicken blueberry, absolutely delightful.  A little small but you know what, totally worth it!  I recommend the parking lot just a half block away though.  There's not a lot of street parking."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. I ordered the duck confit and egg and was not disappointed in any way, shape or form. The bacon was served in succulent chunks; the egg was nice and runny; and the duck was deliciously pulled. 

Service was also really good and the coffee, while not spectacular, was not bad."}
{"text":"If you live or visiting Calgary, you absolutely owe it to yourself to visit this place. It's probably slightly more expensive than your typical diner, but then OEB was never meant to be your \"typical diner\". They actually give a **** about what they serve and strive to be best at what they do. It shows. Everything from the quality of food to presentation is top notch. If you're craving a nice breakfast, head to OEB and you won't regret it. However, be prepared to stand in line for 15-40 min depending on how busy it is."}
{"text":"Now I am a girl who LOVES breakfast foods! Just... not at breakfast time. I am not a morning person, I work late, sleep in late, then usually don't eat a meal until I have been up for a few hours. But I do always want that first meal (whether it's at 11am or 2pm) to be breakfast. So A place like OEB, that has jaw dropping, delicious, creative and sinfully decadent breakfast that is served in a quaint, cozy cafe until 3pm... Well now, that is most definitely my kind of place! 

My one complaint, the thing that prevented the 5 star rating. I am an avid believer that peanut butter is a major breakfast staple, it can and should be spread on pancakes, waffles and french toast. For a place that has a commitment to local, to fresh ingredients, that puts fois gras on poutine and makes 5 different fresh fruit smoothies, I just feel like they could do better then packets of Kraft. Some farmers market chunky PB, something. But that's just my suggestion."}
{"text":"Came here around 2pm on a Sunday. Had to wait about 5 minutes for a table which was great. I checked the no wait app before and it said no wait (which surprised me since you always hear that there's a super long wait time) I think the secret is going later on. They close at 3 but ppl were still being seated at 2:45. We had a latte and a green tea and ordered the Porchetta eggs Benedict. Husband liked it, comes with a side of fruit and side of potatoes. Many ppl were ordering the big bowls, next time we'll have to try that!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
OEB Blend Coffee by Caffe Umbria
Boxd Confit de Canard - Poached Eggs, Sous Vide Duck Confit, Lingonberry Jam, Asiago, Brown Butter Hollandaise
French Toast Trifle - Meyer Lemon Curd, Seasonal Berries, Sicilian Pistachio, Fresh Whipped Cream

Located just down the way from Diner Deluxe, a veritable \"restaurant row\" for breakfast in Northeast Calgary. OEB Breakfast Co. shrinks its competition's footprint into a cheerful rectangle decorated in Chickens, orange and yellow, a team of teenage blonds serving a throng of patrons plates from the kitchen in back; delicious plates featuring the sort of ingredients typically reserved for dinner in more refined environs.

Awarded best Brunch nods by numerous publications, their Instagram-ready BOXD items including everything from Lobster to Black Truffles, it was at the center of a communal high-top that seating was offered on a cold Wednesday morning just minutes after opening, a house-blend from Caffe Umbria warming the bones and exceedingly smooth even without Cream or Sugar due to a very low amount of acid.

Using the word 'foodies' in their advertising, but better described as Chef-driven and Farm-focused, OEB takes a slightly different approach from the local-seasonal ideas common throughout Western Canada, instead making coast-to-coast connections that allow for the very best organic greens and the sort of diversity inclusive of Chorizo Meatballs or Rabbit Mortadella.

Without a doubt an experience best taken by way of group sharing, but unfortunately limited to just myself with a full-day of driving and eating to follow, it was with a dine-in Bowl of Duck Confit that the morning got underway, the Cheese Curds of other BOXD selections eschewed in favor of housemade Jam and Creamy Hollandaise that meld with soft-poached Egg Yolks and the funky Leg Meat over crunchy, fried Fingerlings.

Left to a difficult decision for my sweet selection, the Banana Cream Pie and Cheesecake items from a section titled \"My Mom Can't Make This......\" both tempting, it was on the suggestion of a server who impressively kept Coffee brimming that the French Toast Trifle won out, the thick-cut slabs of Golden Brioche stacked beneath housemade Lemon Curd and Whipped Cream plus Berries and Pistachios - the sort of French Toast that doesn't even need Maple Syrup, though the addition of it most certainly did not hurt."}
{"text":"Yum. This is definitely a top notch breakfast. Super long wait to get in. They have a wait list system, but we didn't know about it before. Seemed to me that everyone had to wait a long time, no matter what. Anyways, we eventually got a table, but we had to be quite pushy with the host. They quoted us 45 minutes and after 50, we asked when our table would be ready but it seemed there were tons of people in front of us still. We did get a table, but I couldn't help but feel we would have been waiting a lot longer if we didn't go up and talk to the host. 

Me and my husband both ordered a Caesar, which I loved because it was served with a huge, crunchy pickle. I ordered the breakfast with two eggs, bacon and the pancake. This was simply the fluffiest, yummiest pancake I've ever had the pleasure of eating. So, so good. The bacon was awesome too. My eggs were scrambled a bit runny for my taste, but I still ate them. My husband had the duck bowl, which was basically an insane amount of potatoes, with duck and other deliciousness. A totally decadent breakfast, but the flavours really worked. The potatoes are nicely cooked too. 

I would be hesitant to come back because of the wait, but it might be worth it for the pancake."}
{"text":"I used to dine at it's predecessor, Country Kitchen, for breakfast all the time.  So when it evolved to Overeasy Breakfasts aka now OEB Breakfast Co, I was definately curious about it, and the constant weekend lineips out the door definately indicated that the food was something to be explored.  Later, I found out even more of the story, as the owner was a top chef in his own right, who with a love of eggs and the desire to have his own place and make his own hours to be with his family more, opened up Overeasy!

Well, I went on a weekday instead whereas the place was 1/2 empty, and tried out a nice farm fresh free range scrambled eggs with their home made country sausage (it's HUGE) with some toast (I believe it was a nice multigrain) and looked around at the fairly unusual way it was decorated with chalk scrawled messages everywhere.  Kinda kitchy, and I found it a bit gauche myself, but hey, I guess this is what it's like to be hip?

Back in Montreal, there's this legendary breakfast place called Cosmo, that pretty much aspires to be THE greasy spoon breakfast center of Canada (ohhh.. the triple order, 6 eggs with tons of bacon and toast and and... I love Cosmo....).  OEB is just as much the opposite of that as it aspires to be the most nature-based (they raise their own chickens for the eggs) and cleanliest breakfast resto ever.  

It was simple, but well done.  If you close your eyes, you really can noticed a bit of a difference from the eggs, as the taste seems to be a little more eggy pronounced.  The single sausage was simple huge, absolutely meaty and yummy with each bite.  Bread?  Well, multigrain toast, however fresh to me, is still more or less just multigrain toast.  But is it worth the cost?  When considering that you're paying the same prices as a Denny's, but with the quality of product that far exceeds any Denny's or Smitty's, yes it is.  Is it worth the line up on weekends?  No, I don't personally think so, but recommend anyone who really wants to try it out to run in during a weekend.  Virtually no lineups, and the chef can spend more time to focus on your meal."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! Visited here on August 8th. Super easy to find, not too much parking though. Inside was small, diner like, tables and a large island in the middle on the room. Let me tell you this was the most satisfying breakfast I've had in a long time. We ordered coffee, orange juice, eggs florantine (be careful if they offer you avocado, it's $4!!), and the lemon custard French toast. Our bill came to $45 but it was a really good breakfast splurge. The place was packed but we got in right away, our waitress was super fast and polite. Everyone's meals around us looked drool worthy. I wouldn't recommend for children as it's a pretty busy place and very loud. This is my new breakfast spot to go to in Calgary. Advice, just make sure to ask how much extras are (avocado, syrup was also apparently extra)."}
{"text":"\"The best in town\"This place needs no help with their PR, just delicious food will be found here"}
{"text":"I love brunch, brunch is my favorite meal of the day!!! Before over easy, I was going to Diner Deluxe a whole lot, unfortunately OEB has stolen my heart for brunch from Diner Deluxe and other brunch diners (SORRY!). 

Last time I was there I had the Croque Madame, soo delicious! If I ever want to eat here I usually go fairly late in the afternoon to avoid waiting in that horrendous line (just tells ya how good this place is!)."}
{"text":"The Lowdown:
Pros: Great setup and convenient reservation system.  The ingredients are fresh and the coffee is very good.

Cons: Long wait times without the app, service was sub-par and a bit pricey for what you're getting.

The Long Story:
I've never been to any of the OEB locations before but I have heard consistently good reviews, so when my friends sent me a txt at 8:45am to meet for breakfast we quickly got out of our Sunday sleep-in mode to try it out.  We had no idea there was a waitlist app that allows you to skip wait times.  We did it the old school way and arrived at around 9:35am.  The wait time according to them was 10min and we specifically mentioned we needed five (5) seats.  We said one of them would be for a baby but we needed a chair because our friends were bringing their own high-chair.  We were told it would be fine and that we'd get five seats.

Once inside we were brought to a table with four seats and some sort of baby seat contraption and asked how much the baby weighed.  I had mentioned that we asked for a table of five and the host just brushed it off.  My friends didn't really want to argue about it and considering we had already been waiting over 10 minutes we just took the table.

Our server came immediately and took our drink orders.  The coffee is quite good. I take my coffee black and so I was happy for the fresh cup.  I ordered the farm fresh breakfast: 2-eggs, toast, a meat (I chose the blueberry chicken banger) and their twice friend potatoes.  The food came out really fast.  The meal was OK. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of the toast, it was too thick and reminded me of french toast.  The potatoes were good but not as good as they're hyped to be (twice fried in organic duck fat?).  The blueberry chicken bangers (just a fancy way of saying sausage) was the best thing in the meal.  All in all I'd say you can easily spend under $12 at Denny's and get a more satisfying meal.

It didn't really help the situation much when the host is a bit rough around the edges, doesn't smile and barely answers with more than 2 words.  He wasn't blatantly rude but I got the feeling like he didn't want to be there.  Also, our server sorta quit on us half way through our meal without any warning so someone else picked our table up."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's a must-go if you're looking for unique, flavorful brunch items in a sweet/kitschy environment with great service.  We were lucky enough to sit in the bread basket (I think? - maybe it's a waffle?) booth which was so cute. When we told the manager we were in from out of town, he could not have been more hospitable.  I had the lox/dill box and it was so delicious, my boyfriend had the lobster box and was equally satisfied. I'd HIGHLY recommend OEB for a great meal with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visit was on our way to Canmore/Banff area. We had traditional eggs Benedict and poutine with bacon \"lardons\". Superbly delicious. If we were local we'd definitely be regulars. Get your place on waitlist via app as we walked right in and another couple was told 40-50 min wait."}
{"text":"Just up the street from Diner Deluxe, and waaay better! Super friendly staff make all the difference and you forgive good service the long wait time, because you feel acknowledged and looked after. 
We waited 20 minutes for a table and didnt mind at all. We stood by the kitchen and watched plate after plate of heaping yummy goodness pass by and were well impressed. Given juice and coffee by the hostess, we didnt even want to go to our table.) 
Excellent food, great service, funky decor. 
Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I am visiting from California and ended up in Calgary during one of the worst floods in a while. I decided to venture out anyway to try this place with all the road closures and it was definitely worth it.

I had the Gold Digga with the pork, truffle and soft eggs. The presentation was awesome as it was served in a little to go container and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The flavors were awesome and the eggs and the rich truffle worked perfectly with the crispy potatoes. 

I will definitely be visiting this place again before I take off to LA!!!"}
{"text":"Just like all the people in Calgary, their staff here are extremely polite! My waitress was Leighsha, she gave her honest opinion about food - whether or not it was too much for me, recommended the egg's benedict with boar speck (even giving me a sample of the boar speck, in case I didn't like it!) and held a friendly conversation! The restaurant's atmosphere and environment were cool and chill for breakfast and brunch! Had a great time."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the food was absolutely amazing . I had the Gold Digga while my boyfriend had the Canadian Lobster and Shrimp Crepe. One star off for the service. The waitress was very friendly but not attentive. We had to ask multiple times for our water refills even though the place was not vey busy. All in all good experience, definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Their fries are awesome! I ordered the lobster and shrimp crepe, it's full of flavor and the hollandaise sauce was different  as they used brown sugar to make it.

The line up was long but worth the wait. Get the no wait app!

Highly recommended for brunch!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Calgary! A must when visiting. Portions were big and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place - very comparable to a lot of the other brunch places, but there's something fun and cool about OEB. Love coming back here !"}
{"text":"My friend took me here as it is, according to her, the best breakfast/brunch spot in Calgary. And the food did really live up to the hype. Unfortunately, because of the popularity we had to be on a waiting list for almost 1.5 hours before we got in. So that was not as enjoyable. Hopefully when they open their new location some of the crazy business will abate, but considering how good the food is I wouldn't be so sure. One fun thing is they serve alcohol from 8am, so you can toast your breakfast with a mimosa or a Caesar - a little hair if the dog before hitting Stampede perhaps.....definitely worth a visit but be prepared to stand in line and wait!"}
{"text":"If I could go back and try everything on the menu, I would. 

One of the best breakfasts I've encountered while traveling. The duck fat fried potatoes are enough to give this place 5 stars, but everything was good. I was envious of the food my fellow diners were eating even though I enjoyed my own meal so much. 

Good coffee and a friendly staff put everything over the top."}
{"text":"Speechless! The food wasn't that good. The wait was long. They gave away our table. I had the Nutella French toast it was overly sweet. They even charge you $2.50 for maple syrup. That is just crazy! Honestly it's really expensive. And I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Can you image the variety for breakfast? They have the magic lottery box (you never know what's inside) and the delicious grilled scallops in a box. You might think, wow seafood for the breakfast would be too much or too heavy. But actually not, the crab / scallops/ salmons were so tender and fresh, those magic boxes can make ur day!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast sure goes down easy. Overeasy breakfast serves up a wicked list of brunch items. It satisfies all my senses with their delicious brunch items and colorful, quirky decor. They have the perfect amount of tease by making you wait but not too long (about 30 minutes on the Monday we went).

There's an app that tells you how long a wait time you're looking at before you saunter over here. We got there and left our number. It was nifty because we were able to track our where we were in line. We came down promptly and boy was it worth the wait!

Everyone raves about the fries cooked in duck fat. They were deliciously crisp and reminded me of wedges. Not your typical home fries! Shrimp and lobster crepe was delightful and filling! It basically exploded when I cut into it and perfectly creamy. They also have some friggin' good French toast. Their portions are big so we opted for fruit as a side. It was a nice array and it included jack fruit!

Overall, I left a happy camper. The only problem was I didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"Lovely, small diner with an upscale feel. Don't let the outside exterior turn you off. The interior is cute and cozy!

I came here for a late (2pm) breakfast & was pleasantly surprised by the excellent flavors of the food! I ordered the Canadian eggs benedict with homemade Hollandaise brown butter sauce, and back bacon. The biscuit (and the entire eggs benedict) was gluten free and I loved the texture of it. 

My family split a crepe that had bananas, strawberries, blueberries, homemade whipped cream, pistachios, and they loved it."}
{"text":"BEST BRUNCH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.
This had place has blown every brunch place over ever been to out of the competition. I wish we had this place in Edmonton because I would be here everyday. I ordered the crab eggs benny($17), I got salmon and avocado added to it too. I can honestly say that I could've eaten that meal everyday for every meal. I also got side potatoes and it was so yummy. If it wasn't frowned upon, I could've easily licked my place clean.

Good coffee, good food and absolutely lovely service. If you live in Calgary and come to visit, this place is a go-to for brunch. Be sure to reserve in advance! It gets quite busy."}
{"text":"We spent our last day of vacation in Calgary near the airport at an Airbnb and wanted to get some good breakfast in before we left. We found this place on yelp and walked over. The environment was excellent. Interior design was nice, clean and modern. The service was excellent, thank you Mathew! He always came over to make sure we had  coffee and water. I had the traditional eggs Benedict and it was phenomenal. Everything on the plate was gone when I was done with it. It was one of those experiences where I was full but couldn't resist finishing it because it was so good. I highly recommend this place and would for sure make it a point to go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"I have been to OEB twice now and have now been twice impressed  I am of the opinion that breakfast is a completely acceptable... no... excellent choice of meal to have any time of day. So far, oeb has been my favourite breakfast spot in Calgary!

I have been lucky enough to go at times I didn't have to line up long, if at all. I hate queues and will normally go somewhere else if the wait is longer than 10 minutes... but I would encourage anyone to wait a while longer for this place!

Both times I visited oeb, the service was excellent. The seating is more comfortable at the normal tables rather than the hightops if you're given a choice. The servers are very knowledgeable about their menu and provided me and my friends with great suggestions. Their menu is large so everyone should be able to find something! Coffee refills were frequent and all my needs were anticipated and seen to.

My first dish was the box'd Gold Digga. It was delicious and the eggs were perfectly soft poached! The truffle flavour in this dish is very much at the forefront so I would personally recommend getting this dish with the half spinach half potato option available as I found it a bit rich with all potato.  Hollandaise here is also very well done.

My second dish was one they run out of regularly.... the Hog & Scallops box'd breakfast. Again, I recommend doing the half spinach option. The two big sea Scallops I received were seared and sweet and we're perfectly cooked for me... I like mine slightly underdone. No rubbery texture or fishy smell. Fresh and delicious! The salty pork and rich Hollandaise complemented the scallops well, making for a beautiful and tasty meal!

Definitely one of my new favourite spots in Calgary! Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"It's good. My sister's friend LOVES it so we would go here a lot for breakfast. Spent many good times here. Lots of cool breakfast options available. A tad crowded and always a long wait to get in, but worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE OEB and could almost eat there every day. The eggs Benedict is superb and the thick-cut fries are amazing. Seriously, I don't particularly like potatoes but these are fried in duck fat for a crispy outside and so much flavour!"}
{"text":"Fun spot in downtown Calgary. The decor is fun. Try and see how many egg inspired items you can find while dining. I had the duck confit breakfast bowl which was beyond filling so if you are hungry and looking for something that is hearty and filling this is the way to go. The service was excellent. There might be a little bit of a wait to get seated but service is pretty quick once you do."}
{"text":"The food there is awesome!! I had Gold Digga! Best brunch I've ever had. It was a worth wait. I would've given them 5 star if I didn't have to wait an hour to be seated. But other than that, it's great place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and servers here are really great and super helpful. I had the Tuscany breakfast with poached eggs. I honestly have no idea how they make poached eggs in the shape of a hard boiled egg. It was perfectly cooked, just how I like it, but sadly it was cold on the inside. I should have said something, but it actually tasted delicious and I was so hungry I didn't want to wait any longer to eat!
Delicious fresh juices too. I had grapefruit and mango. Next time I would get grapefruit and orange. It's also pretty expensive. I exchanged the prosciutto ham for bacon, but they still charged me extra 2.50 anyway. I would have thought the 'special' prosciutto ham would be more expensive than the bacon. But they said pork belly is costly. Anyway, it was good bacon. I would return just for those eggs, hopefully warm next time!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is really good. Huge menu selection. I had a benny with duck and as someone who has never had a good experience with duck this place changed my mind. Really really great. Wish I could have tried more. But what we did order was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"quite possibly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.   Obviously chef inspired, and not something just slopped on to a plate.   I love this place."}
{"text":"Must use the nowait app. Commit to it. It is worth all the hype. If you want your taste buds blown away, you must eat here. We have tried many times to eat at OEB. At either location. We were lucky enough to get a chance to eat here for the second time and it was just as stellar as the first time. The breakfast poutines are excellent, every ingredient is prepared with care and plated beautifully. How they poach the eggs so flawlessly is a mystery to me. Portions are large. Eat here."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. They are not very accommodating to dietary needs, treated us like second-rate citizens, and their food was overpriced for what you get and nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast restaurant that I have been to in a very long time.  My wife had the Primera Ommlette and I had the Banana Creme Pie French Toast.  Both dishes had very large portions and tasted amazing.   The wait staff were really attentive and made our meal enjoyable.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here 12 times and it's my favorite breakfast spot to go with my family and friends. 

The food is amazing and fresh and the proportions are huuuuuge !!!
I don't think anyone can finish their double trouble (one of my favs) plus the price is reasonable with what you are getting 

The staff and overall atmosphere of the restaurant is good 

But I'm knocking a star down with their uncomfortable sitting arrangements some times you are crowded with the middle island table and chairs suck!

This place made me start yelping again have to spread the word about this place"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is always busy. Fortunately they use the No Wait app and their wait times are very accurate. Friendly staff all around. Free coffee at front door while waiting. All the 'Box'd' items are my favourite!!"}
{"text":"Have tried coming here several times and was never able to get in. BEWARE the edmonton trail location is now closed. 
 Called early in the morning to see what wait times were like and being decent we rushed down there since we were told on the phone that they dont take reservations. Once we got there the girl put us on a wait list. However 2 parties of two people arrived awhile after us and got seated first. When we asked the girls why,they responded with that they had reservations, which we were clearly told on the phone that they did not do. Once they decided to seat us, they walked us past several empty tables which makes no sense being that there is \"no reservation list\".  So the communication on this part was frusterating as they should have a better system in place being how popular they are and how long they have been around. 
 Food was good yes, however based on the hassle and miscommunications of trying to get into this place, I wouldnt choose this place over another in the future. Hence the 3 stars for service and hassle."}
{"text":"A good brunch/lunch place in the city. Unfortunately, it is so popular that you do have to wait a long long time. Thank goodness for apps that allow you to put your name on a waitlist, but you still have to wait sometimes when you arrive. If you don't want to wait, then go on a random weekday.  The whole menu is your typical brunch menu, but they do have lots of duck fried fries in a lot of their options (which is always tasty). Worth a try if you want brunch."}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot! If you're a fan of Lox, the A Lotta Lox Box is AMAZING. Add some avocado and you will not be disappointed. The duck fat hashbrowns/fries are also great so the two together is a winning combo. 

Naturally, the only downfall to this place is the wait time is VERY long (I'm talking like up to 3 hours on weekends) wait times. If you wanna try this place out, the weekend isn't really the best time. The earlier the better, especially on weekdays. On days like this when you just need your fix of amazing breakfast food, the take out has never failed and is ready within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the gold digga boxed. It was ok, doesn't taste bad but the black truffles and roasted pork were both far and few between. I almost prefer new york fries poutine  which is half the price."}
{"text":"I have great time here with good food and friendly staff. Wait time was long but it was expected since the app told us exactly how long we should wait. The only negative comment I have was that the fruit wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite OEB location because it has so much space. I can bring my 7 month old daughter and not feel bad she's taking up a spot. 

Food is delicious of course. I always get the A-lott a lox. Eggs are cooked perfectly. Hollandaise is so creamy. The salmon comes on top in thin strips which gives it an interesting texture complementing the entire dish. 

They don't take resos, but we used the wait app so we could get put on the wait list while we drove there. 

By the time we parked we got the notification our table was ready :)"}
{"text":"I seriously eat here on average about once a week. I try to go on weekdays because the line-up on weekends can be insane. The food here is amazing, like EVERY SINGLE TIME. These guys do it up well. You pay for what you get here. The servers are always friendly and cheerful even when they're absolutely swamped. 

Try:

Soul in a Bowl, any variety. You're welcome.

Anything with hollandaise, it's from scratch and will make your life complete.

Croque Madame: soo cheesy and delicious.

Pancakes feel like little clouds of breakfast crack. In yo mouth! And real Quebec maple syrup is a rarity, so take advantage!

My only suggestion would be to order a side of toast and/or hashbrowns with the threesome if you want ALL THE THINGS as I often do. I was a bit sad to miss out on these last time!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. Great portions, reasonably priced, good service, and my favourite, nice big coffee mugs. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Delish food, cute egg shaped ambiance. Had a great sandwich with avocado and eggplant pepper spread. The portions are very big. Highly recommend. Only down side is there are not allot of vegan options since it's egg themed and the potatoes are cooked in duck fat."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast joint on Edmonton Trail! 

Thanks to the yelpers who reviewed OverEasy.  I had to try it out for myself.  Brought the family to OverEasy.  Waited in line for about 15 minutes.  While waiting in line, we recieved complimentary coffee.  That was nice on a cold wet morning.  We finally got our table in this small long restaurant.  

We ordered the following:
- Traditional.......2 poached eggs, black forest ham - I liked the poached eggs and ham and the hollandaise sauce was a wonderful complement to the eggs and English muffin.  The plate also came with fresh wedges of honeydew, orange and watermelon.  What was the best of the plate was these wonderful herb potato wedges!  Crispy on the outside and mushy and delicious on the inside.  

- Breakfast Panino on hand made brioche........Omelette style eggs, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, roasted tomato & fresh fruit garnish- Wonderful combination.  

- Smoked Steelhead salmon Omelette....With green onions & Spanish capers - Very good omelette.

- 2 Cracked Egg Breakfast........2 eggs any style, herb potatoes, pork country sausage - Very well presented and tasted really good.

Make sure you try their ketchup.  Has a nice taste and different from Heinz.

Interesting centre long table in the middle of the restaurant.  Neat white high chairs; good for 2 persons sitting opposite each other.  There are hooks under the table for ladies' purses or jackets.  

Good little place for breakfast; parking is very limited though."}
{"text":"OEB is one of my favourite breakfast/ brunch spots in YYC! It's always extremely busy and the space is quite small so be prepared to wait- but it's worth it! 

The service is always fantastic. They have an extensive menu so there's something for everyone, presentation is lovely and they use such fresh & local ingredients. If you haven't been here then definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast meals I have ever had!!  No wonder the wait can be so long.  The service is quick and the servers are fun and friendly.  Get the \"no wait\" app to see how long the wait will be.  The food is so creative and I really appreciate that they locally source almost all of their ingredients."}
{"text":"I like how you can sign up for waitlist online and it is pretty accurate on how far along the line you are. The food was good and has huge portions. The only negative is how you will be seated in between 2 different parties."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town. Variety of things to order on the menu. BEST pancakes ever. When u look at the menu, they seem unassuming...because what's special about pancakes??? Well these are a secret recipe apparently, and they are delicious! A must order!"}
{"text":"Tried the downtown location for the first time. Hands down OEB is one of the best brunch places in town and their new location did not disappoint. Had their feature, Ahi Tuni with avacado, 2 poached eggs on a bed of waffle fries that were fried in duck fat...so good. It's a feature so not sure if it's a regular menu item, but if you have a chance to order it, do so! Also the location is beautifully designed so high marks for ambiance!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise... Came to Calgary for the weekend and my friends suggested this restaurant.  The reservation was done via yelp.  It was easy and simple.  The decor is colourful, warm, and very hip.  We shared our table with another group.  The place was full but it was not noisy to not permit us to conversate.  The food was so good.  Well presented and very tasty.  I had a rabbit Benny with salad.  It was beautifully presented.  The flavours were fresh and we'll combined. I think it is one great meal to start my day. I finished it all.  The service was good.. There were a bit of a mixed up with the bill and when bringing the plates but I think it was related to the waitress being new.  Overall it is recommended and I will be back for sure when in Calgary.  I hope they come to Edmonton soon."}
{"text":"I've only been here the one time and oh my god, was it delicious. I had their duck confit & egg which was amazing. The potatoes were crispy and browned, just the way I like it. The duck was juicy and flavourful, definitely cooked well (the meat itself was more at a medium though). The poached egg was also very well done - definitely a soft as i asked. 
 
Everything was extremely tasty! They were also very nice to my friend who has a number of allergies. The waitress made some friendly suggestions and even told the kitchen staff to accommodate her and replace missing portions of her dish with something else. Super friendly staff ! 

Unfortunately, it is a very small restaurant and it is ALWAYS busy. They also do not take reservations, for this reason. It does mean that the line up can be quite long (sometimes 30+ minutes!). I would say it is worth it though!"}
{"text":"After going to this location, I can now see why it's the top rated brunch place in Calgary. 
Had the Smoked Salmon Scramblette. My friend had the French Toast Trifle... the latter wasn't even what we imagined it'd look like. It was better! Rather than it being layered in a parfait glass, it was two pieces of thick brioche toast sandwiched with berries, whipped cream and lemon curd.

Generous portion of smoked salmon and the duck fat fried potatoes were amazing as well.

Food is great, service is phenomenal , and the prices are reasonable. 

Definitely recommended.

{"text":"Blown away with the most delicious eggs benny I have ever had the pleasure of tasting! 
I had the Canadian Benny and I knew it was going to be great just by looking at others food in the small but quaint restaurant.  
There was quite a few staff working but I didn't mind, we sat down and food arrived in 5-10 minutes!  I tried to enjoy each bite as much as possible, but I loved it so much I gobbled it down like the carnivore I am!
The yolk and hollandaise sauce together was pure heaven! I can't wait to eat here again, if you live in Calgary, I am jealous you get to eat at such a delicious place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday around lunch time and it wasn't too busy. ordered two poutines and a crepe. i found the crepe to be very sweet and didn't suit the savoury filling. i dont remember what was in the crepe apart from something with truffle. the poutines were delicious with wedges that still had a good crunch to them though. ignoring the crepe, definitely five stars"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place in Calgary. The food is outstanding served by a friendly staff. The place is small but, the staff moves fluidly between tables serving the food with a smile and attention to the little details that make a difference. The menu is different enough to mention that it is not your usual breakfast menu. It has a hollandaise sauce that is absolutely delicious. The smoked salmon, poached eggs and duck confit are the best.

{"text":"I've heard a lot about OEB from the day I moved to Calgary but the last time I tried to go, the place was on holidays. 
I didn't know they opened a location downtown and I immediately called up a friend to go when I found out. 

I loved it. 
Interior was great - very cute, clean, and bright; staff were very friendly and efficient; food was genuinely great - me and my friend ordered different things and they were honestly both great. 

The price is a bit higher and portions are a bit less than other brunch places, but I personally thought it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"One of my fav places in town for brunch. Their delish bennys are served on buttery croissants, with always sexy perfectly poached dark yolk eggs. Hubby went with the crab benny, loaded with plenty of crab - the dijon added a nice spicy kick, but masked the fresh sweetness of the crab. The indulgent hollandaise sauce more than made up for that and practically begs to be licked off the plate. I indulged and had their hogs and scallop poutine. Slowly rendered salty smokey bacon lardons, seasoned potato wedges, cheese curds, poached eggs, lightly seared scallops and hollandaise. A touch more cheese curds wouldn't have hurt, but definitely waddled out after brunch despite the refreshing cut fruit that came with out meals. The wait in line online app was great, and service is always super friendly. Only suggestion: add a baby change table to bathrooms, as otherwise they are kid friendly with highchairs available."}
{"text":"This place is the busiest brunch place in the city - and for good reason.  Be ready to wait in line or download the no wait app and arrive when they tell you your table is ready. The menu is extensive and the fresh lemonade and iced tea are made in house and delicious!! I got the Double Trouble which was a LOT of food. The brioche was so rich and the arugula, tomato and bacon were a good compliment to the dish. The fruit is also a highlight with not your typical selection - in a good way. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of the better breakfast locations in Calgary.  This particular location is always busy and very popular.  The food here is consistently above par and always a good choice when you need a good breakfast with a reliably fresh ingredients. Cooked fresh and and served by friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"There isn't much to be added to the basic information that.....This is an absolutely fabulous breakfast. I have to admit I like my eggs scrambled and over cooked, so I am not a great example of breakfast fare. However, sitting at the bar watching breathtakingly beautiful plate after plate of glorious breakfast goodness leave to waiting tables. It was almost enough to make me habe to try eating poached eggs. The menus is simple enough. The presentation is fantastic the service well above average and the coffee is way above par.
If you live near here you should be eating here every day if you don't....it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"To give it less than 5 stars would be just plain nit-picky.

Great service, parking next door, good coffee and fantastic Eggs Benedict.  I had rabbit on mine, friends had crab on theirs.  Potatoes fried in duck fat are a dream.  Perfectly crispy.  How many ducks had to die for my fries?  I'm not sure, but their sacrifice was worth it!"}
{"text":"After years of wanting to check this place out, I finally did!   Came here with a friend and baby on a weekday morning which meant no waiting!    The menu is extensive, lots to choose from except for coffee related beverages.   You can get a standard cup of coffee or tea.  No lattes or the like. 

I had the Canadian Eh eggs Benedict.   It was phenomenal.   Eggs cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise fresh and tasty.   The hashbrowns were nothing special, but were well seasoned.    

Overall I enjoyed my visit,  the dishes and the service were awesome!"}
{"text":"We got there early and didn't have to wait which was nice, however it was really cold inside.

My date got the waffles and a side of bacon... the bacon was fatty, undercooked and over priced.

I got the box'd hog and scallops.... at $17 it was a huge rip off and a disappointment. It looks beautiful and it's great in photos. 

There were only 2 scallops: undercooked, 2 perfectly poached eggs, bacon lardons and potatoes. It's basic taste was pretty good, however: there was hardly any hollandaise sauce and there was so much salt on EVERYTHING that it was nearly  inedible... in fact this dish gave me food poisoning before I even paid the bill.

I don't see myself having this again. However for those people trying it out for the first time I HIGHLY recommend that you beg for ZERO SALT, the double smoked bacon lardons are so salty that there's no need for any salt on anything else... did I mention that $17 for 2 scallops is beyond ridiculous?! This dish would have been great with a small side of fruit/berries included in the price. This dish has lots of potential! 

The decor inside is really nice actually and our server was wonderful. 

They need a separate wait room,  our table was surrounded by customers waiting and pushing while we were dining and it ruined the atmosphere... we even had to fight our way through the ignorant gaggle of waiting people just so we could LEAVE?!

Overall I'd say OEB needs to work on some things. I'd definitely try OEB again.... but maybe not until they relocate, and I'd ask for no salt... on everything lol."}
{"text":"My biggest problem is the wait, as usually getting in if you come on the weekend close to breakfast seems impossible. On that note I love the food and could understand everyone wanting to eat there. The truffle squash benedict was one on the yummiest new dishes I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"My first time in Calgary..and I am sooo glad I found this place online. 

See, I'm the type of gal who hates going to big named chain restaurants...

OEB is completely the opposite. It's chic, warm and cozy, and inviting....they have a wooden counter-height long bar table in the middle of the room, accented with beautiful modern light fixtures under a unique chalkboard ceiling with all the breakfast things and sayings you could possibly think of. \"Great Eggspectations\"...

The vibe was great. And morning vibe is quite important, right?

My boyfriend and I came here twice. 

First time, i had....

*Mariposa Farm Foie Gras Poutine : I swear to God, the world turned silent on my first bite of that lovely foie gras sitting on top of the box. Sure. $24 may be too steep for a breakfast meal...But it was totally worth it for my money. At that point i didn't care. Give me the foie gras. And I'm happy. Not just that.. it totally blended well with the poached eggs and the cheese curds and the black truffle.. The hollandaise sauce is intensely gratifying. The combination of it all was foodgasmically sparkly to the tastebuds. It was heavenly..It was like eating with anything fictional..like unicorns and fairies and princesses. I seriously didn't feel guilty after. (okay maybe a little the next day when i wore my bikini to the hot spings)...

*The Soul in a Bowl: The name describes it very well... If I die, i'd let my soul wander and be part of a box this delicious. The bacon...the brown butter hollandaise...the poached eggs....the crisp but moist potatoes... OMG. Cory devoured everything.

Our second trip here...i got...

*The Gold Digga: Poached eggs, herb potatoes, cheese curds, crisp PORK BELLY, black TRUFFLES and brown butter hollandaise. WHUUUUUUT! again. i suffered from major food coma and sat silently in the car for two hours trying to recuperate my breathing. Amazing. The pork belly was crisp!!!! it wasn't hurried in the pan to fry.. it took it's time to work it's magic...to steam out it's taste..and golden up it's fat. that's what i like.

*Farmer John's Delight with a side of pancake: so i guess Cory ordered the girly plate this time. But man..their pancakes are the best i've had EVER. the edges are crisp and the middle is fluffy and light. It wasn't greasy. It was very tasty....

I SUPER RECOMMEND. Writing this review was tough. I salivated with every sound of my keyboard."}
{"text":"This is a reaaally busy place. Unless you decide to go early, make a reservation. 
Their bacon is way too good!"}
