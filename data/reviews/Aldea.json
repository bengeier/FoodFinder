{"text":"Last night my family and i had the dis-pleasure of going to Aldea for diner. We arrived early (6) and were immediately met with horrible service, overshadowed only by the mediocrity of the food. When our  3 steaks arrived, the owner threw it in front of us yelling \"steak\" like my junior chicken was ready at McDonalds. Not advising which steak was well done, medium etc.Normally not one to complain, i was dismayed when my filet mignon came well done instead of medium-rare.  To their credit the owner took my plate back and said he would fix the errors. Im happy to say that 6 minutes later I had a wonderful steak infront of me, kind of quick for a filet Mignon. The inside of my steak was colder than a January day in Montreal. We lost count of the number of mistakes they made with all our meals. When my brother-in-law made the remark  that one of his entrees had not been served, the owner thought it would be a good idea to tell him to change his understandably annoyed tone. The whole family was absolutly floored by the lack of profesionnalism. Definitely the WORST RESTAURANT IVE EVER BEEN TO."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this newly opened portuguese family run restaurant and loved it! This resto is perfect for a romantic evening for two or an evening out for birthday celebration with friends. The interior decor and open concept kitchen is simply fabulous as one can see all the beautiful dishes being prepared. Their seafood dishes are simply delicious for all you seafood lovers and dishes are reasonably priced. Service is warm and friendly...will definitely go back. Don't forget to try their fabulous pasteis de natas!"}
