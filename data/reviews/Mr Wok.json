{"text":"Sushi is excellent but they only give you 6 rolls compared to many other places that give you a full sushi roll of 8. I also ordered lo mein which was really good because it was made with the thick noodles instead of the cheap thin ones. I like that they have both Japanese and Chinese food because a lot of people don't like sushi but like Chinese. I would rate Mr. Wok five stars if they gave the right amount of rolls. The roll shortage wouldn't bother me if it was not the same price as places that give you the 8 rolls. Please fix that Mr. Wok!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was way better than any fast food Chinese restaurant. The employees were kind and courteous."}
{"text":"Really bad food like a knock off panda express I got the orange chicken extreamly salty terrible I paid 6$ and it's good portions but the quality sucks no flavor and the chow main is crappy don't waste your money poor quality"}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers,
I never had a bad experience here since they opened. I live down the street from them but was always scared to go to this place. It wasn't till my brother and sister in law ate here and bought some home I realized that it's so good! I don't like generic Chinese like Panda Express that is so fake. This is actually very yummy and the staff is so charmingly nice. The eating areas are always clean and well kept the only thing I could complain about is the bathrooms. They are really pretty but visitors always mess it up and make it dirty. 
I recommend this place it's so delicious."}
{"text":"Very delicious food for a great price I love how their food taste so delicious. Very bomb food. I would definitely return. The cashier was so nice and generous. She made the experience better."}
{"text":"Not real Chinese food . Taste horrible and all the sauces are so dull. I will not be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"Tried this place due to rave reviews on Yelp...All I can say is that it lived up to the hype. Great value for the $$$. The place was very clean and new. Will I frequent the establishment again? Most definitely. Great food for the value."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I cannot believe how much food you get for the price. Everything I tried was really good. Nice place to take your family to after church if you want something quick, easy, affordable and good."}
{"text":"This place in increditable. It is a MUST TO GO! Outside may seem a little dated but that has nothing to do with the food inside. One of my favorite Asian Restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"This place is good for the price. They don't always have what you want ready, that's my only big complaint. They didn't have sesame chicken the past 3 times we went in. The food is good, the service is friendly. It's a great place to stop and pick up food when you don't want to cook dinner. Feeds everyone for cheap and 4th 2 item combo is free!!"}
{"text":"Very displeased and upsetting at this place.  Came over for their ALL YOU CANT EAT on Sat/Sun.  No where on their windows says nor no other signs inside saying the time limitations.  Very disappointing.  And the employees there were more concerned with their personal lives at work than attending customers."}
{"text":"Ate here 2-4-17 for the weekend ALL DAY buffet at after 8 pm and it was really good. So, we decided to do it again the next Saturday and were told the buffet ended at 7:45. The sign says they have it both sat and Sun dut no stopping time. Ask to talk to manager and he was very rude. He stated that it is his decision when to close and we should order off regular menu that costs the same but with less food. I really liked this place but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on previous reviews. This has to be the WORST Chinese food I've ever had. Orange chicken and Sweet/sour chicken was bland, no flavor, awful sauce, and the chicken was nearly inedible. Rice had big chunks of dried rice, absolutely no flavor. Noodles were okay, nothing to write home about. Will NEVER eat here again. If I could give less than one star, I would."}
{"text":"Only thing eatable here is just the rice and noodles. I have no clue what part of chicken they use for the rest if the dishes it does not look or taste like chicken. The lowest quality meat probably leftover chicken parts that they serve mixed with sauces. Got three entree plate to go could not eat the meats all chicken dishes were bad."}
{"text":"My very first visit and 
I broke my tooth on the fried rice, there was something very hard.  And when I go to try another bite like a  idiot I cracked second tooth.... found very hard pieces of something in my food and ended up needing emergency dental to fix my teeth."}
{"text":"I never had a liking for Chinese food and going here has changed my mind. I had the Beef & Broccoli Lo Mein with a drink and it was very easy on my wallet. Im a pretty big guy and it usually takes a lot to fill me up and I couldnt finish my plate. It was delicious and Im definitely going back.

The only bad thing was that the food wasnt as hot (temperature wise) as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Just tried the Chinese food which was mediocre at best by my picky standards. Maybe the sushi would have been better. 

This location was originally home to Yen's for many years- an exceptional neighborhood Chinese restaurant which closed about a year ago due to illness. My expectations were no doubt high and unfortunately not met. 

I used to make a 20 minute drive for Yen's but don't expect to do the same for Mr Wok.
But try it yourself if you're in the area and write a review to confirm or deny my experience."}
{"text":"Do not come here the food is horrible over deep-fried everything taste old. All the employees were texting on their phone place is empty for a reason consider yourself warned. My diarrhea bill was high from so many medications I had to buy and rehydrate myself. I wish I could sue them but the lawyer said if I would've kept the receipt I could've been compensated. Horrible place 

-My stomach"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times were really good. I am really really picky about Chinese food but this place met my standards. There was a lot of flavor and tasted really fresh. The prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"I'm super sad... They stopped doing the weekend buffet!! Food is still good but too expensive to make it worth the drive anymore. :0(  Too bad."}
{"text":"My husband and I have decided this is the Chinese food place for us! We usually get the two dish combos with the crab puffs or spring rolls on the side. The food is always extremely fresh (we even went in just a half hour before close and it was still fresh!) not to mention delicious. It's a little out of the way for us but well worth the drive! It's clean, family friendly and very reasonably priced. Seriously we can get a meal, a side and a drink for the same price that you can get a meal at Panda Express! 

The only thing that threw us off was that no one on here thought to mention that this is fast casual, not casual dining. So you still have to walk up to the counter to order. But other than that no surprises, just delights!"}
