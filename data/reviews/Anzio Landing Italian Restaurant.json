{"text":"I don't usually give harsh reviews, but this one is really well deserved.   The start was promising, with a basket of bread brought promptly.  But the bread was a couple of sliced pieces of French and a couple of rye.  Seriously, sliced rye bread.  Note this place is next door to a terrific bakery, Breadsmith, but for some bizarre reason they don't take advantage of that.   I had the meatball sandwich.  The bread was obviously a part-baked baguette, which they hadn't bothered to toast properly, the meatballs were bland, and not even simmered in the sauce (meatball prep 101 folks).  Sauce was OK but shouldn't it be a marinara?  It was all chunky. Accompanying the sandwich was a side of sweet potato fries.  Strange, but they weren't horrible.    My mom had the spaghetti with meatballs. The pasta had quite a bit of sauce and some meatballs plopped on top. For an extra dollar you can add mushrooms (she found two).  The portion was also very skimpy, which in this case was probably a good thing.  This dish came with two sides, asparagus and spinach.  The asparagus appeared to have been boiled, and had obviously been frozen, not fresh.  And the spinach, whoa, the spinach!  Got a guess as to how this was prepared?  I kid you not, it was deep fried.  Who does that?  The owner came by and actually bragged about it.    My sister ordered Caesar salad, and the stuffed mushroom appetizer.  The salad was made of all the worst parts of the Romaine head, and was drowning in dressing.  The mushrooms were stuffed with seafood and had a cream sauce and balsamic glaze.  They were inedible, tasting like cardboard (albeit with a cream sauce and balsamic glaze).   We expressed our displeasure to the waiter, who was very nice and I must say did a great job.  I felt really bad for him.  He actually promised that the desserts were really good, and he didn't lie.  I can imagine that they had the desserts brought in frozen, but the cheesecake had a lovely fluffy texture and the lava cake was a cute little bundt cake served with vanilla ice cream.    So if you find yourself at the NE corner of McDowell and Power, possibly stranded, and you can only eat dessert (possibly for religious reasons?), I would recommend this place.  If not, continue on your way and don't look back."}
{"text":"Thank goodness they closed the doors! Terrible food, service and owner! Get a clue Mr. Owner!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  The waiter and manager couldn't have been friendlier.  The bread was deliciously buttery, garlicky, and cheesy flavored.  I had the chicken and strawberry salad as an entree.  It was such an amazing mixture of flavors with the strawberries, mandarin oranges, lettuce, feta cheese and grilled chicken.  It came with strawberry vinaigrette which was also delicious, but the salad was so flavorful on its own that I only used the vinaigrette on a few bites.  The raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake came on a graham cracker crust and was served with a flaming sugar cube - great presentation!  It's a tad on the pricier side, but with great service and excellent food, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This was a cool restaurant when it was located on Falcon Field, especially for a pilot.  The food was decent, but it didn't matter because you had the ambiance of Falcon Field out the window.  The new restaurant should change it's name to strip mall landing to reflect its new location off the freeway.  When we found the old location closed we did drive to the new location, but decided not to eat there since it's just like every other strip mall  bistro.  I don't know the details behind the move from Falcon, it may not have been by choice, but they could have maintained the flying memorabilia to go with the name."}
{"text":"We went to this place last weekend. They had just moved to this new location.  First we sat outside at the bar and had a drink they said it would take a few minutes for a table.  It ended up taking at least 30 minutes. We ordered the bruschetta- it sucked! We finally got a table.  The waiter said it may be a bit before we got our food because they have ahd some turnover in the kitchen, etc, etc.  Well, we had to wait for an hour and a half for our food!! It was ridiculous it wasn't even that busy- the owner came by and was talking to customers.  He did not really seem to be to sympathetic.  The food was not even very good - Olive Garden is way better.  The bartender and the waiter were really nice though even though there was not too much they could do!"}
{"text":"Food was good....not great.  The spinach is really good though and a great surprise.  Had chicken Marsala and although the Marsala sauce was very flavorful I think the chicken was a frozen pre-cooked breast that was microwaved. Still tasted good though. Staff was friendly and you can't beat the off the runway dining. I think next time I'll go with the spaghetti or lasagna."}
{"text":"Glad this place closed! Worst experience I have ever had in my life. Went there for Valentine's Day 2 years ago with my wife. Loved the old spot and the food prior to it being sold. I was searching to see if they were still in business. I would have been shocked to find out any different. I still feel like they owe me $100 for that shitty meal and service!"}
{"text":"Was trying to make reservations for Valentines day called the phone number on their website and kept getting the voice mail. Found a email address on the contact us. Owner emailed me back and informed me that they are no longer open"}
{"text":"We \"were\" very excited to see Anzio's had relocated to the corner of McDowell and Power, next to D'Vine. Thought we'd give it a try being it had been a while. Service was pretty decent (however, TOO many bussers hanging around in the dining room doing nothing).  I ordered the Anzio's Cosmo. I was pretty good. Got a basket with 4 slices of bread (slices of bread? Really? Breadsmith is right next door! How about some rolls, or focaccia, or artisan cheese bread) to hold us over while we waited for dinner. Hubbie got the spaghetti and meatballs with marinana. Meatballs didn't taste like they were made on site. He liked the marinara though. I ordered the Pasta Mediterranean. The dish was weak and lacked flavor. It had lots of cherry tomatoes, olives (which were supposedly kalamata but didn't taste like it) and I found a small chunk of artichoke. It needed some garlic and/or capers. Something to give it a kick! It was edible, but not memorable (except that I'll remember not to order it if I return).  Decided to split a dessert and ordered the tiramisu ~ VERY good!  Best part of the meal.  I hope the new owner/owners at Anzio's read these reviews and make improvements because I'd really like to see them succeed. Unfortunately, it will be a while before I return."}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful view of the surrounding runway. The Mandarin Orange and Cranberry pork is excellent. The wine list is pretty solid, the staff is happy to provide samples of several wines and is very knowledgeable about pairings with dishes. The bar serves up great martinis! Have tried several deserts which are an excellent way to end your meal at Anzio Landing."}
{"text":"We went there about Oct 19th.  From the more recent reviews nothing has changed. We liked them when they were by Falcon Field.  Went a few times a year because they were a bit of a drive.   When the moved to the new location we figured we would give them a try. 1: to much help running around with their heads cut off 2: he brochette what to have salmon did not. what we did get was god aweful.  Bread not toasted and not fresh. While i am on bread, they are located next to a bread smith.  Would have been nice to get day old bread.  Bread was not warmed and it was stale. 3: one waiter tried to serve us a flat bread we did not order (help disorganized) 4: We waited well over an hours .. at least for our food after ordering. 5: our food was initially severed to the table next to us. 6: my wife order was lost.  they did get it out about 10 minutes after serving the rest of us. 7: the food was almost warm.  I think it had sat while they completed the order.  At best it was a 2.5 star.    The owner came by several times.  Said one cook quit and another had a death in the family.  Ok I understand.  I came to your resturant which by the way is so loud that we could not talk (try adding some acoustic baffles).   The waiter asked if we wanted desert.  I'm sorry did you not comp me at least one desert for a table of 5.    After 2 hours for a medioca dinner, i would think the owner would be smart enough to comp us something.  My wife meal that came while the rest of us were half way thru our dinners.  The owner moved to try to get people like me to come several times a month.  Wont happen.  I really hope that someone bought out his old lease and paid to remodel the new place.  I don't think he will be able to give the place away."}
{"text":"The wife and i after being wishy washy about diner home or out chose out not wanting to venture to far we chose anzios we have been by this place 100s of times and always say.........we need to try this place.....so last night was the nite when we walked in i had visions of sitting in the bar having a cocktail and a app so we ventured into the bar which was empty and the lights were up bright and the tv blasting  we pulled up a tall chair at a table and sat the chair was very  uncomfortable  the server was nice to shut the tv off after my wife said it was to loud then after all that we decided to sit in the dining room. the server seamed a little miffed but not to. we pulled into a big comfy booth and ordered calamari which came w/marinara sauce for dipping no james beard award but tasty then we split the chicken/sausage diablo w/bowtie pasta which were NOT aldente way overcooked for my taste but the sauce was good the dinner came w/1 salad he accedently brought 2 and left it for no charge the server was prompt and friendly and the food all and all was decient...........so now we've tried it not sure i will rush back but worth a try.the wine list is pricey 31 dollars for a bogle petite syrah    ( 8dollar at trader joes) and higher"}
{"text":"Some of the most average Italian food you will find.  But that is not the attraction.  Go to be seated right off the runway and to savor the company and history of the 'greatest generation' that makes up the majority of the patrons.  A nice way to cap off a morning at the nearby Aviation museum."}
{"text":"Way better then O Garden!! You have to try the cheesy ravioli, and the crispy spinach. The waiter told us that the crispy spinach melts in your mouth and it really did! The cheesy ravioli is like fancy mac and cheese, and really anything that is covered in a cheesy sauce is good! The service was phenomenal and will definitely go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I've been there quite a few times and have always enjoyed the food.............Everything from the appetizers to the desert.  Prices are very reasonable, and the staff is  friendly. It was quite busy the night my husband and I went, but we were seated very quickly.  I would highly recommend Anzio Landing's to anyone who wants to have a great meal, at a reasonable price, with a fantastic view of a private runway........Watching the private planes come in once in a while was a great treat.......Don't misunderstand, this is NOT in the middle of an airport!  It is just a cool experience to see up close if you are lucky enough to witnesss it.   Great food + Great service + Great prices + Great atmosphere = Anzio's Landing"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good spot in Mesa for a multi-generational dinner.  Someone in another forum recommended Anzio Landing.  It was a great recommendation!  We had 4 generations present at our meal---the oldest (my Dad, age 84) and the youngest (age 7 months, our grandson).  The staff from the manager on down couldn't have been more accomodating and friendly.  From the time we first walked in the door to the time we left the restaurant, we always felt welcomed.  Service was great with only one glitch---the waiter forgot to bring one drink.  The manager came by and that was pointed out to him.  He apologized and had the drink out very quickly.  We started the meal with calamari which was cooked just right---in other words, it wasn't rubbery.  The coating was quite good---flavorful and crunchy.   Much to our surprise, the 3-year olds even liked it and wanted more!  The following main courses were ordered---lasagna, grilled chicken, beef ravioli, tortellini, and Anzio spaghetti.   The beef ravioli was a generous portion---large raviolis served with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese---tasty but filling.  The lasagna portion was huge!  It came with something I never saw before---fried spinach leaves which were surprisingly good---light, yet crunchy with a hint of olive oil.  The Anzio spaghetti was also a generous portion with spicy Italian sausage, meatballs and mushrooms.  The tortellini was well liked by the person who ordered it --- same for the grilled chicken.  All entrees came with a house salad and garlic rolls.  Whenever I see \"house salad\" on a menu, I always ask the server what the dressing is.  The server said it was a \"Caesar salad type dressing\".  I don't like Caesar salad but the server told me that it was surprisingly good and not at all like what one thinks of Caesar salad dressing to be like.  He was right!  I found it to be very flavorful and thankfully absent of that strong cheese flavor of typical Caesar dressings.  The garlic rolls were bland---I had hoped for more of a garlic flavor.  Plus they weren't truly authentic Italian bread.  When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by a sign that says their creme brulee is \"award winning\".  With a title like that, how can one resist?  So two of us decided to split one.  It came with a flaming sugar cube on top---something I had never seen before!  I had to agree---it was some of the best creme brulee I ever had!  It had a firm crust that was complimented by a very flavorful custard.  One person had some spumoni which I tried.  It, too, was good quality.  We had hoped to be able to see planes landing while we were dining.  Unfortunately, since we went for an early dinner, the sun was still strong so the restaurant shut the blinds.  As the sun set, the blinds were opened and we did see one plane land---something the 3 year olds enjoyed.  The total cost with the  restaurant-added gratuity for our large party was $185.  Only two adults had alcoholic beverages---the rest had soft drinks.  I do recommend giving this restaurant a try---not only for the food but for the warm hospitality shown to us all."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!  My chicken was full of gristle and the vein had not been trimmed out, it was dry and tough...yuck!!  The sauce was on only half of my pasta while the other half was dry.    The service was good and the bread was wonderful...but for the price it was not worth it!!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks last Saturday nite before we had dinner at D'Vine next door. We live a mile away so we always like checking out new local places. We had been to the old location at Falcon Field a few times, but not in at least 3 years. I remember that location as having good food, but as being a bit old fashioned and catering to a quiet senior crowd.  So we sat on the outside portion of the indoor/outdoor bar and people-watched the inside of the place. The first thing I noticed was they had not refinished the indoor/outdoor bar top from when it was Zocalo. The bar top is made of concrete, and the clear coat and paint were in various stages of decay.  Nothing inside the restaurant looks like it has been changed since it was Zocalo. Not that the decor is bad....it's just not new.  I just had a beer, so not much to say about that.  But my wife likes to try red wines, so she began asking the bartenders questions about the various selections.  They were either out of several items, or knew nothing about the ones they had. They just basically let my wife try samples and waited for her to decide. These guys' demeanor was mildly distant, non-engaging and completely unenthusiastic. They did not want to be there.  Inside the restaurant the employees and patrons just looked like robots going through the motions. The place has zero energy. It was about 40 pct full at prime time on a Saturday nite. With 15 employees and 25-35 people inside, you would think there'd be some noise, but the silence was deafening!  If you live in the area and want cheap Italian with good energy, great service and employees who care, head to Red, White & Brew.  If you want scratch-made, super-fresh tasty Italian served by an attentive, personal staff, head to Alessia's.  Me and my wife would really like to see a great restaurant succeed in this space, just to add to the local options. It's a great location for Las Sendas/Red Mtn Ranch residents. This place ain't gonna cut it unfortunately."}
{"text":"Flew over from Orange County to see my parents who were in Mesa from RI. We had lunch in their new location which is a great looking place, very comfortable. Service was great, food was great, and it's nice to see the owner really involved on the place. Will definitely go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Garlic Pork and Pork Tenderloin really taste so yummy. The Owner makes you feel at home. So friendly and service is quick and efficient. Can't wait to visit late afternoon to watch plane take offs and landings while ravishing my Creme Brulee."}
{"text":"Most upscale Italian restaurant I've seen in my 10 years in the Valley. Romantic and intimate, not your thing if you're into chain restaurants because the menu prices will scare you off. ;)"}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant for many years. Even when it was in the old location at falcon field. It is wonderful Italian food. My favorite dish has always been the penne pasta with grilled chicken and sundries tomatoes. The dinner salad is nice with a unique and tasty dressing and the service is always good. The new location is even more convenient for us as well. I would highly recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Went there for a New Year's eve and was disappointed.  The chicken was tough and the Alfredo sauce was separating and we had a new waiter that forgot or could not hear what we were asking for...  Not a horrible experience, just disappointing.  We will not be back!  I have had a lot better, especially for the price..."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review because I remember Anzio's the way it was 10-15 years ago.    Tonight I visited for an early Father's Day excursion.  Was the food good?  Yeah.  Was the service good?  Yeah.  Well then, what was the problem?  The problem is that I have lived in the area for over 25 years, and we used to go to Anzio's all the time.  It was THE PLACE TO GO in NE Mesa.  Standing room only.  Swing music on the PA system.  Waiters/waitresses in military garb.  A true WWII atmosphere.  Oh...and the kids got crayons and the place was JUMPIN' every night of the week!!!  Community salad and breadsticks, spaghetti, family friendly.  Senior friendly.  A LOT OF FUN!!  Then the ownership changed.  All of a sudden, the prices doubled, the atmosphere turned into a church, families evaporated, and so did the clientele.  I am SO SORRY to say that I don't like Anzio's anymore, because I really, really want to like this restaurant.  There was nothing wrong with the food or the service tonight, but the heart of the restaurant is gone.  It was so sad tonight for us to see the place 80% empty on a Saturday night.  What can the owners do to bring back the customers?  They need to CUT THE PRICES, then welcome back familes, then become a FUN place to go to dinner instead of a stuffy, white-gloved joint.  There are tons of families in NE Mesa that are looking for a great place to go out to dinner with their families right on the flightline of the airport, and they are willing to spend the money if it's a fun experience.  My kids are grown, so I'm not talking about a Chuck E. Cheese experience, but there needs to be a place for extended families to meet and have fun with each other.  Sadly, Anzio's is no longer that place.  Tonight's food and service were adequate, but it was not what I would consider to be \"FUN\".  Please...owners...BRING BACK THE OLD ANZIO'S!!!  If you do, your business will thrive!!!"}
{"text":"We just came back from having dinner in this sub called \"Italian Restaurant\", it was bad, the size of the plate was like appetizer and it was the actual dinner plate, the service slow and the waiter arguing with me for the olive oil, I did order olive oil and they brought corn oil arguing with me that it was olive oil, the flavor in the pasta was plain, we kept adding salt and still plain, the bread, ho my goodness, it was hard, could and funguses. The price was way high. We will never go there, right across the street Red White and Brew restaurant you pay the same money but they give you much more food and much better quality and the service, not even compare. Never again Anzio Landing \"Italian (?) \" Restaurant."}
