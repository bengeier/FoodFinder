{"text":"I like when the actual cooker of the food comes out and explains what I am eating.
Popcorn sprouts exist!

They based their dishes on ensuring vegetarians can eat it and slip in some succulent meats to cater to those who chose to.

The combinations worked in some flavors that seemed unattainable.
Loved the Cornbread with grits.

What I would say is that I can give this chef almost any ingredient for example crickets and he can get a slam dunk in exotic flavor or a 3 point shot of a salad.

I would love to go another pop-up event to sample.
I can give them a Fiver.
Unfortunately, now I have higher expectations which makes it tough on my upcoming reviews."}
{"text":"I attended a pop-up event catered by Urban Acorn on April 1st.  It was an absolutely delicious 3-course meal  All the ingredients were fresh, and each course was a feast for the senses.  The plating was beautiful to look at, and the flavours and textures were perfectly balanced.  The chef made polenta, an ingredient I often don't enjoy, so delicious by serving it as a cake under a perfectly cooked maple-glazed Cornish hen.  The appetizer composed of potato latke with a cucumber salad, and the dessert of strawberry and lavender shortcake were equally delicious.  I cannot wait to attend another event from Urban Acorn."}
{"text":"Marie and Daniel hosted a fantastic party for 8 of us in their catering kitchen. Daniel worked away creating beautiful and incredibly tasty courses while Marie joined us for dinner and was basically the most engaging and fun-loving host in the world. 

This was a prix fixe dinner party where they customized the menu around our food issues (one vegetarian, allergies to dairy, peaches and balsamic). The ingredients were incredibly fresh and varied, we felt like we missed nothing. Also, did you know you can make vegan marshmallows out of chickpea water?!?! 

I can't recommend these two enough for any of your catering needs. Both their dishes and personalities sparkle!!"}
{"text":"These people are da bomb! This company is amazing - I've used them almost a dozen times for my office and also our wedding. They listen to your vision and create magic in the kitchen. They are always coming up with delicious and innovative dishes - but also destroy (in a good way) the staples. I would recommend them for small or large and anything in between. 

Whenever I hire them the food is always delicious and the presentation beautiful. Very awesome and great company - Dan and Marie are awesome at what they do."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit in love with Urban Acorn after my first experience nomming on some delicious food at a recent Pop-Up they were a part of. It was a 3 course meal of epic delicious perportions. Course after course we were pleasantly delighted with a.) the beauty of the plating b.) the creativity of the food and c.) of course, the joy our taste buds were having! 

Chef Daniel Holloway is amazingly talented, and his partner Marie is wonderful. Meeting them we could instantly tell how passionate they are about Urban Acorn, the food, and their vision.

I HIGHLY suggest you check out some of the events they are involved in (pop-ups, supper clubs, and more!), you will definitely NOT be disappointed. I will definitely be going to more in the near-future!"}
{"text":"Whether or not you're Vegan or Vegetarian, your life will be made infinitely better with a few bites by Urban Acorn. I attended a Yelp dinner hosted by Urban Acorn and it was splendid! Please do yourself a favour and try their amazingly delicious food and terrific hosting.  They will explain each dish in detail as it melts in your mouth like perfection. 

Every single course was bursting with flavour and the BYOW makes it a party worth sharing with friends. Try them out and bring a few friends!"}
{"text":"Although the vegan monthly supper club is now done for the summer. I highly recommend to try out a dinner in the autumn when they start up again. While not cheap it is always a lovely experience and a great opportunity to try a vegan take on traditional cuisine. Keep an eye on their website for details.

The 5 course dinners are themed and always different. I've been a few times now and enjoyed both the food and the experience as seating is picnic table style and encourages conversation between guests."}
{"text":"Their brand of \"gluten free\" is not suitable for celiacs!

I ate here at one of their \"Vegan / Gluten Free\" Supper Clubs and became violently ill about an hour after finishing the meal. I have celiac disease and know what it feels like to be \"glutened\", and sadly, that's definitely the cause of my illness.

Urban Acorn has denied all responsibility for the incident, ensuring me that the meal was 100% gluten free (which even the best restaurants won't claim if their kitchen isn't totally gluten free; Urban Acorn's is certainly not). Which I suppose means that they think cooking food that makes people immediately vomit is somehow better? 

Unless you'd like to find out, I recommend avoiding these guys all together."}
{"text":"My mind just nearly exploded when I realized I had not yet reviewed the lovely people at Urban Acorn. 

They are consistently pumping out super supper clubs, of various delicious themes. Join their mailing list and do your tastebuds a favour: http://www.urbanacorn.ca. 

Now onto their catering... 

If you or your guests have dietary requests (vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, any sort of specificity really) the lovely people at Urban Acorn are incredibly accommodating. They do these specialized suppers all of the time, so they don't see it as an obstacle, they see it as a delicious challenge. 

I've personally planned a vegan supper club with them and worked with them at another larger event, and they're just so. Darn. Pleasant. One of the owners has Haitian roots, so if you're at all into that type of cuisine, you should ask them to do an island bend on your treats, you won't be disappointed. 

In conclusion, if you're vegan you should get engaged just to have them cater your wedding."}
