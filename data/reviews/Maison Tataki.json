{"text":"We stopped into Maison Tataki for a bite on our way to a show at Le National. The service was good, the waitress was nice, she made suggestions. This is one of those americo-japanese restaurants that pride themselves on serving dishes with twists. I'm totally ok with that usually. For example, there is no sashimi on the menu. Anyway, the food was interesting and good, but not delicious. Their beef curry soup was good. The house salad had delicious grilled octopus on top- mouth-watering!-- sadly there were only two teeny weeny pieces smaller than half my pinky. Also, the salad was drenched in dressing. The two final dishes were good but not as tasty as I had expected (crab-stuffed salmon) and insanely tiny portions, we left hungry and we spent 60$. I need to take off 2 stars for the horrendously small portion sizes and the absurdly high prices. I give one star for service, 1 star for food and 1 star for location/decor. I don't think I would go back, I know so many better places."}
{"text":"Paid $18 (including tax and tip) for the worst beef teriyaki (lunch special) on the planet. The miso soup was basically just salt water."}
{"text":"Un peu cher pour les faibles quantité et qualités des plats. La carte offre peu de choix et aucun dessert."}
{"text":"Very good food. We went with the waitress' suggestions. The service was A1. Will come back."}

Whenever you're new to a restaurant, best ask what's the menu concept and recommendations. Which is what we did. 

Their menu is actually a tapas menu, a tasting menu or a appetizer menu if you will. I went in there fully expecting my bill to be a treat to myself as tapas menus are generally more pricy. The $$ of this listing should actually be $$$ or $$$$.

It's a Japanese menu with a twist. I would say that anything Tataki, which is included in their name, is delicious. Take the time to savor the different sauces and hints flavors. I also tried per recommendations of the wait staff the \"Coquille de Petoncle\" (scallops) which was divine. One of my favorites there. I'd say don't miss out on the \"Pizza japonaise\" you won't be disappointed and the \"Étoile de Mer\". Another speciality is the \"cuillere magique\" which is crab meat wrapped in salmon and sauced with house sauce. Everyone there seemed to order them so we gave it a try. Good call. I'd say it seemed to be 3 or 4 plates per person to be satisfied.

Don't go for the usual boring \"miso soup\", \"gyozas\", \"edamame\" or \"tempura\" etc, you're going to be missing out on the real gems. You're here for something different than the usual japanese-american dishes.


There is a short list of main meals as well which were ramen (noodles), ramen soups or teriyaki. I tried the sauté seafood ramen and it was delicious. Filled me up. There take next to ours had a ramen soup that looked great. Will try that next. 

Now as for the decor, its nice and inviting. The bathrooms are.... Clean! Wow. They also have a nice back patio with fountain. The staff all seemed nice and pleasant. The owner and head chef seemed to know his customers and took the time to go see their tables when he had a break. It seems that you can also order \"chef's creations\"; as some dishes I inquired about when I saw them come out, were not on menu.

All in all, we were 4-5 every time and our average bill was about 40$-60$ on the tapas menu and 20$-40$ for a full course. Definitely will go again. I love tapas and all the different flavors it comes with. That's the price for fine cuisine. If you're looking for a cheap place with just quantity, try their Ramens, they fill you up but otherwise, you should try somewhere else. It made me laugh when some customers asked the wait staff if they had sushi."}
{"text":"Service très mauvais, j'ai du appeler trois fois avant que quelqu'un ( de très désagréable) confirme ma réservation. Sur place: le restaurant sent affreusement la friture, odeur qui a pris des jours à se désincruster de mon manteau; le service nous pousse a manger rapidement et partir et la nourriture y est plus qu'ordinaire."}
{"text":"Je n'y retournerai jamais, ma soupe était ridiculement minuscule et ne contenais que deux morceaux de légume et un fruit de mer, m'a coûté 10$ avec les taxes et n'était même pas bonne. Les autres portions sont meilleures mais ridiculement beaucoup plus dispendieuses. Je n'ai pas trouvé qu'il y avais de spécialités a proprement parler pour démarquer le restaurant. Malheureusement je ne pense pas que ça va rester ouvert longtemps pour ces raisons. Bonne nouvelle au moins ;le logo du restaurant est beau..."}
{"text":"WOW!~  this is an amazing restaurant, this was my first time trying out japanese cuisine and it was totally worth the try. the food was great, very fresh. I specially loved their \"magic spoon\" and I also tried their \"fried ice cream\", it was really delicious!!! It's a really nice and cute place, very peaceful, they have a nice view in their backyard.The workers are very welcoming and service is good enough. The only thing that i would recommend is maybe to add some background music and it would definitely be greater if more and more people knew about this restaurant because every time i talk about this restaurant, a lot of people don't know."}
{"text":"The Best Worst Restaurant?!

The decor is beautiful, clean and modern. What can go wrong?

Bad service + cheap food! 

I highly recommend the owner to provide a learning session to his/her staff about \"customer service\".  If you are in a restaurant business and your staff doesn't give a damn about thing. You are destined to fail.  

And please invest in quality food please!  We are in 2013 now, cheap food just doesn't cut it. You know the quality is bad when the food from food court places taste and look better than the food here. 

This restaurant has so much potential. But from what I experienced so far...it is not good...not good my friends!"}
{"text":"Bonne soupe au cari et boeuf. Service correct. Bon teriyaki au poulet. Dommage que ce ne soit plus \"Apportez votre vin\"."}
