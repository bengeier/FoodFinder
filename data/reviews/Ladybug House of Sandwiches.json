{"text":"Found a good deal on Yelp that led me to a great lunch spot!! Large sandwiches that come with chips! We also got potato salad, which is yummy..would come back! Good service & friendly staff"}
{"text":"Delicious Home made Sandwiches and Comfortable atmosphere. Very unique ingredients combinations! Perfect for lunch when you get a sandwich, soup and chips. They get pretty busy during the lunch hour. The service was friendly and attentive. Very delicious, would recommend. Quaint sandwich shop. Reasonably priced. Would go again."}
{"text":"Betsy, Charlie Brown, Duke..... these aren't my friends, well, on second thought, maybe they are... these are the names of my favorite sandwiches at Ladybug.  And really, what is better than dining with friends?  The Betsy is a culinary marvel....at least according to my warped one part white trash comfort food, two parts Fodor's Rating Required palette. Get this - lettuce, cream cheese, green olives (with pimentos!), and walnuts..... there you have it... it answers every weird craving you have ever had - try it on the marble rye and wowza - another taste sensation in the mix!   The other reviewers have touched on all of the great things this establishment can offer to single customers, but I need to tell you something else - This is absolutely the best place to get a tray of sandwiches for your office - they will cut them in half (these are not skimpy sammys, dear reader), they will provide any assortment  you ask for -  AND!  They will give  you a credit on your next order for returning the catering tray!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple days ago and I really liked the sammies. Hubs had the T.J. and I had order envy! I really liked my Italian Hero and would order it again, but might bargain for a half sammie switcheroo because the T.J. was really good. We did the Yelp deal and I got the fruit salad and he got a side salad. Both were very good. Service was very friendly and helpful and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, cute decor! Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!! The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid! Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!! Talked to the owner and she was very nice."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Always super sweet, the food is consistently fresh and delicious and they take substitutions and requests with no problem whatsoever. Great food, DELIVERY, and wonderful ladies. I will always give them my business"}
{"text":"Found a Groupon on this and it was convenient to where I work- went there for lunch, and it was so cute! Lady bug themed for sure. Cute outside patio where I ate my lunch. Would not necessarily take a client here however the staff was friendly (I believe it was the owner) and she was extremely helpful. Great potato salad!"}
{"text":"Great & quick service, friendly staff, but over-priced for the quality. Only went here because of proximity to work and that has to be the only reason they can charge what they do. The sandwich was good but looked like one I can make at home, and it wasn't nearly big enough as I expected for the price."}
{"text":"Cute little place with good sandwiches! Had the 10 for 20 deal and it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ladybug for many months now & I will never go back. I literally had the order taker on the phone ASK me for a tip. Now mind you, I always tip. I forget one time on accident because I was on the phone at work & I feel like I'm being grilled about how they use their own car to drive to me & blah blah blah. Where they deliver to is literally 2 minutes away, if you can't afford to not get your $2 tip, you need to talk to your boss, not me. Not to mention, I had a toothpick in my sandwich. Not the one it's closed with but one actually in there. I bit into it. I told the lady on the phone & she proceeded to tell me they close their sandwiches with toothpicks & I told her I took that one out, this one I bit into. She proceeded to tell me that never happens & then offered to say she'd \"take care of me\" next time but with an attitude. Next time came & it never happened. So I'm done with this company. I'll go somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Best family run place for soups and sandwiches in downtown. The bread is always fresh, and the soup is always hot. I have eaten here numerous times and always been satisfied with my selection and service.  It can get pretty busy here during lunch with call in orders."}
{"text":"The name is appropriate due to the overload of ladybug decor that covers every inch of the tiny cafe-- it could have been cute but instead it looks tacky, like they just buy any crappy ladybug item and toss it into the mix.  There is definitely a lot more outdoor seating than indoor (I think there were two, two person tables).  They do have misters to help, but I was still really hot sitting outside in the AZ summer which made enjoying my lunch more difficult.    The food is very basic.  It isn't anything fancy, but rather much like a sandwich I would make for myself at home.  The counter is lined with bags of bread, just like you'd find at a grocery store.  I understand paying six-eight bucks for a sub sandwich which is much more filling and hearty, but for a simple sandwich like I could whip together at home it doesn't seem worth it.    The broccoli cheese soup was pretty good, but the plastic spoon they provided literally cut the inside of my mouth on both sides until I was bleeding. It was weird.   There was not a big variety in sandwiches, even though the list was long. Honestly, I would recommend saving the money and making yourself a sandwich."}
{"text":"Wow!  Easy ordering for big groups (do it here on yelp!) and delicious.  Worth every penny.  Large drink = 2 cans of soda."}
{"text":"Cute little place for a sandwich or soup! This place is RIGHT down the street from le boyfriend so we had to check it out. It's teeny tiny with all (I think) outdoor seating, which was fine with us because it is B-E-A-UUUTIFUL out today.   They have a ton of different sammiches and a good soup selection as well. I had the broccoli cheese and it was just ok, I like mine with big chunks of broccoli.  The boy's sammich was tasty, very homemade and fresh tasting.  The ladies working inside were totally sweet and quick to offer up a recommendation (there's nothing I despise more than asking for someone's opinion and getting \"well it depends on what you like.\"), and fit the whole ladybug theme perfectly :]  Oh and they have FREE, NO MINIMUM delivery! Makes me wish it was a lil closer to my work!!"}
{"text":"I'd have pictures but the food was so darn good, well, we ate it. I ordered a decently priced combo sandwich and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was sourdough bread! I have never been one to like sourdough but wow did they surprise. We also ordered a chicken noodle soup that to be honest made me want to slap my momma. I will eat here again, thanks ladies for such a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I love this place because it lets me not leave the office and still get food without ordering at least $20 worth of food.   Also, the food actuallly quite good if you are in the mood for sandwiches. The fruit salad is good too."}
{"text":"Ladybug offers free delivery WITHOUT A MINIMUM ORDER!  So if you're in their delivery area (or, honestly, even if you're a little outside it, as I am) you can order one sandwich and a cookie for lunch if you get stuck at your desk, and they will bring it to you.  QUICKLY!  And they are so unbelievably nice both when you order and when they bring you your food.  They seem happy that you've picked them for your lunch -- it's cute.  Also, their website says, \"No actual Ladybugs are harmed in the making of our sandwiches!!\" which is so precious that you kind of have to love the place.    The sandwiches themselves are not The Best Ever, but they are good, and they are plentiful, and mostly it's such a happy, convenient experience that I order from Ladybug over and over."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery and let's just say that I was quite impressed. Food was great but service was even better.!!!  I will def order again."}
{"text":"Decent food and quick enough lunchtime delivery. My coworkers and I have ordered Ladybug several times and we've purchased the special coupons many times. The menu has a nice variety and the soups are good too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I order delivery from this place a couple times a month because I work from home and on busy days it's just so easy! I always get a sandwich and potato salad. My favorite is the TJ sandwich.  It's delicious and great bang for your buck. Ladies are extremely friendly and delivery is always about 45 minutes or so which I feel is very reasonable. I also love that they include chips with my order almost every time. It's the small things. Just placed an order from here now and my stomach is growling thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Very nice and friendly staff. I am ultra picky about prepared salads. Chicken, tuna,  egg etc. I ordered the chicken salad on a croissant. I travel all over the U.S. hands down the best chicken salad I have ever experienced.  Truly a foodgasm, a must try!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The posole is amazing!  Same with the tame catch. Everything I've ever order has been great. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great little down town Phoenix lunch spot. There are a heap of creatively named sandwiches, breads, soups, cookies. You can choose any sammy and make it a half with a side. I ordered half of The Tame with a cup of their tortilla soup. It was all fresh and tasty. I took my lunch to go in a little brown bag, but they have a cute little outside dining area with, of course, lady bug table clothes. Adorable!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could rate less than 1 star. I have no idea how this place passes health inspection. The salad mixing bowls were stored in the restroom!!!! The sandwiches were made not using gloves and the place is horribly dirty! Also the cookies are old and taste like flour. It was so bad I didn't eat anything except a bite of my cookie. :/ I will never return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food seems fresh every time I go.   The staff is always friendly.    Great little sandwich shop"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the slow delivery. I work in an area that doesn't have many food options & especially doesn't have a lot of places that will deliver. I only get a half hour lunch so this makes things challenging when I don't bring my own food. I decided to try them earlier this week based on other coworkers who have ordered in the past & loved it! I ordered around 12:20pm knowing it could take an hour or so to get to me because that's a busy time. They told me on the phone it would be 40-45 minutes. They didn't come until after 1:30pm. The driver apologized which was nice & like I said, the food was amazing! I decided to order again today thinking maybe my first experience was not very common. I ordered at 11:30am this time to be safe. They gave me the same 40-45 minute ETA. It is now 1:28pm & they're still not here. I called a little bit ago as my lunch break has come & gone & they apologized & said they, \"got a little behind.\" It's disappointing because they are delicious, & I'm really grateful to have anything that can deliver, but going on almost 2 hours seems a little excessive. It doesn't help that I'm pregnant either, which just makes being hungry that much more intense!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the quality. They have the loaves of sandwich bread, from grocery stores, in the window lol. 3.50 for a loaf that makes 7/8 sandwiches. Sandwich meat was clearly prepackaged and not freshly sliced. Egg salad had absolutely NO flavor and tons of onion and celery (can I have a little egg with those veggies????) 24$ for three sandwiches that I could've made better at home.. wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good quality but pricey for the amount of food you get. Had to stop at taco bell after I ate here."}
{"text":"This place was severely disappointing and mediocre. I've made better sandwiches myself in my own home... there was just nothing special about anything what my mom and I ordered. Just a typical turkey sandwich on cheap soggy bread with hardly any meat and a very pale and sad looking chef salad with low quality ingredients. Wasn't awful but definitely wont be coming back"}
{"text":"So today I didn't have my car while at work, So I always see this place and decided okay why not try it, they do deliver.The food is okay, nothing great about the food. It taste like something i can put together at home. Not only that i tried the potato salad and well you can tell it is  completely store bought, wish it  would of been home made, that would of made it so much better. Not only that i ordered about 9:45 AM and didn't get the delivery till about 11:25 AM, I mean they did message me and say they were really busy and they order wouldn't be delivered till 11:00 AM, however over all the food is just, well OK"}
{"text":"Alot of variety. I had a sandwich which came with chips. Also ordered soup which was tasty and potato salad. I came here because I found them on Restaurant.com and bought a certificate to try them out. They have indoor and outdoor seating. It was a beautiful day so we ate outside which was nice."}
{"text":"I love this place, quick great sandwiches that owners put their passion into every meal they dish out! This is a must try if your in the area looking for a great sandwich. I love these little niche local food joints!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about my experience with this restaurant. I had a 50 person catering order submitted that was attended with excellent customer service. The food was great, the delivery to a hospital with a complex check in system was handled flawlessly, and the price was hard to beat. If you need catering done, look no further LBHS - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hidden gem near the hospital on McDowell and 12th street. Don't let the small size fool you, the sandwiches are delicious and creative, and we just found out they deliver. Yeah!  We found this place after winning a fundraiser auction for AZ Women in Song, so thanks for supporting our community, and for the great eats!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I just love Ladybug. The service is always friendly and fast. The place is very clean. The food is yummy. I had the \"Charlie Brown\" and the Cheesy Potato Soup. Very fresh. I love that they put cucumbers on that particular sandwich. What I like is that they will deliver just one sandwich with no minimum. The prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"OMG just an awesome sandwich how did this company not write A5 star review awesome I had the ladybug Club awesome awesome awesome"}
{"text":"As far as sandwich shops go, this one is pretty good. The staff is friendly and the shop itself is unique and quirky. The location is perfect for the lunch-hour crowd around the 7th Street/McDowell Road area.  The sandwiches are maybe a step above average. The meats tend to be of a lower quality than what you might get at a Safeway deli. Rather, they seem to be from some kind of prepackaged brand. It gets the job done, but I think even the meats at Subway are of a higher quality. For the price (almost $7 per sandwich), I would expect some higher quality deli meats.  On the plus side, there is a HUGE selection of breads, cheeses, meats, condiments, and veggies. Despite the seemingly cheap deli meats, the sandwiches taste good. You also get a small bag of chips with each sandwich. There are several decent sides (such as potato and fruit salads), but they are pretty expensive.  Don't expect to be in-and-out of this place within 5 minutes. There have been a few times that I've waited almost 15 minutes for my order. If you're in a rush, I would highly suggest ordering ahead via phone or GrubHub.  But for a quick lunch, this will fit the bill every once in a while. Be sure to ask for a loyalty card which will take $5 off your total after your 10th visit."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I love supporting local business, so when I veered into the neighborhood street to enjoy some local goodness, I was hoping for something as unique as the neighborhood that homes it.  The place was a quaint little shop, with a whole lot of sandwich selections, and the staff is friendly and welcoming.  I stood for a moment to peruse the selection and finally settled on an avocado BLT on seven grain to-go (I can't remember the clever name).  I also ordered a reasonably priced 32oz of freshly brewed tea (which was perfectly tasty).  The sandwich, drink and 'complementary' mini bag of chips came out to almost $10- a little pricey for what I got.  I eagerly opened up my sandwich to find a pretty small square of doughy bread laying over a meager melange of shredded iceberg, avocado, bacon bits and maybe tomato.  It was kinda gooey and I could hardly taste the yumminess I've come to expect with even the most modest BLT.  ...But nothing, it was so... bland!  For $10, I expected better quality ingredients.  If I go back, it'll be for the iced tea on the patio.  Sorry Ladybug."}
{"text":"Purchased a yelp deal and thought we would check them out! We got a couple soups, and sandwiches. The food seems overpriced for the quality and quantity. The decor is awful and the tables and seats were uncomfortable. All in all, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but the only time we eat ladybug sandwiches is when I'm horrendously sick...I mean flu sick...and I'm sooo grateful they deliver! Ive got two lil kids and when I'm that sick, the last thing I want to do is fix lunch for everyone. So I call Ladybug and they come to the rescue with chicken noodle soup for me and kids meals...which my kids just love. The cookies are an added plus for the kids. Thank you ladybug for delivering the healing goodness! :) BTW...wash your hands everybody...its June 2015 and I just came down with the worst Summer cold I've ever experienced! Lol"}
{"text":"Move on over Subway, Lady Bug House of Sandwiches is where it is at! My love for sandwiches has been rekindled thanks to this adorable cafe! The list of sandwiches is mouth watering. The price for a lunch meal is the same as Subway, however the taste is far beyond better! The meat, bread and veggies were combined to perfection and served with love. Ladybug House of Sandwiches is just one of those places where you just go in and feel happy. The passion for what these business owners do is evident in every ounce of their business. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Thank you for bringing the sandwich love back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few times for delivery since they are just around corner from my office. I've tried the lady bug club and the Italian hero....they are just ok. Unfortunately there is just nothing special about the breads they use and the meat is about the same quality you will find at Subway which is not exactly top notch. Because of that why pay more than Subway as it can get pricey here the $5 foot long is a better deal.  Delivery is in a reasonable amount of time which still makes them a potential lunch option when at work and I can't get out."}
{"text":"I was truly suprised I had a country club, frosted fruit salad and tomato basil ravoli. It was all great. The sandwich was so tasty and Hearty. I am now a true fan avocado spread. The ladies are so friendly there; I will be going back real soon. I am so glad I tried this place; and I was able to use a coupon from restuarant.com"}
{"text":"Good service but nothing special foodwise. They make homestyle sandwiches and the soup is very similar to smart and final soup. Alittle overpriced for the simple food. But I guess they make it because there are little options in the area."}
{"text":"The staff is nice.  The decor of the place is a hodge-podge.  I ordered a BLT and potato salad.  The BLT was average.  The bread was fresh, but there was just a tiny bit of shredded lettuce rather than a few crisp leaves.  The bacon was crispy.  They were stingy with the tomato.  The potato salad was practically inedible.  The potatoes were rubbery and hard.  With so many other options, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall sandwich shop.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I had the Italian on Gluten Free Honey Oat bread and it was delicious!  The sandwich is kind of small (maybe due to the size of the bread slices) but it definitely hit the spot on taste."}
{"text":"Cute place with ladybug stuff everywhere. Only 3 tables for two for inside seating. Soups were really good. Sandwiches were a little pricy and nothing special.  Cute tables for outside  seating."}
{"text":"Too much tlc! I feel like I'm going grandma's house for a sandwich every time I eat here. Their soup is amazing as well. If your in the area for lunch give them a try, and don't forget the amazing 50% off deal."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich made fresh.  Friendly folks and a quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery via UBER EATS and for $9 had a chicken wrap and chips. Provolone cheese, cucumber, lettuce, and avocado on a flour wrap, fresh ingredients.   The taste was ok, nothing bold, and avocado was more of the watered down spread that is available at taco shops versus avocado chunks. Chicken quality was good, no rubbery pieces, so I'm glad for that.   Delivery was speedy and it was a satisfying, light meal to get me through my busy day. One star taken for price, which seems excessive for 1 chicken wrap and a fun size bag of chips. If it included a drink or sliced Dill pickle, that would be awesome. I debated giving it 3 versus 4 stars because of the simple taste and lack of interesting flavor, but I had Tapatio on hand to kick it up. The wrap in my opinion, needs an extra something, so I would suggest adding salt, pepper, etc...depending on your taste preferences. I will probably try other things on the menu and order from them again because delivery was so prompt!"}
{"text":"Love this local sandwich spot. Very cozy and the foods solid. Nothing fancy but that's a good thing! Hope more people check it out."}
{"text":"I love Lady Bug!! My mother and I eat there at least 4 times a month. Very courteous and helpful employees. My mother usually orders the Lucy and I order the Bacall sandwich. We swap half with each other so we can taste both yummy sandwiches. I have had many of their sandwiches and have to say, Lady Bug is my favorite sandwich shop. Peaceful atmosphere and a shaded patio make for a relaxing lunch. I also use their delivery service. Their drivers are very nice and are sure to give you a smile. Thanks Lady Bug!"}
{"text":"Always looking to try new spots for lunch. Found Ladybug on Yelp & bought the $20 for $10 deal.  My hubby & I got the same sandwich on different bread. I enjoyed mine, hubby said his was good as well, but was just not enough to fill him up.  I also got the Potato Cheese Soup... this was REALLY good!!  I always have a hard time paying big pricing for something I might be able to make at home just as good. However I felt for the atmosphere, the awesomely friendly service and the fact that they deliver & do take out, this place is great!  I will definitely go back and try a different sandwich & soup!"}
{"text":"And in conclusion..... I don't see how anyone could say this shop is overpriced. Where do you usually eat? Subway?  Sure I can make this sandwich for cheaper than $6.75 but I can also make a steak better than Ruth's Chris and save $40 on that.  Bottom line, the food is pretty good and the staff is friendly.    And Darlene H, don't you feel pretty ratchet getting $20 of food for $10 and then giving a terrible review that states the decor is horrible? Its a sandwich shop, not some fake Fendi bag filled nightclub."}
{"text":"This place is very quaint with a lot of personality.  The staff is super friendly.  There are plenty of choices, so much so that it could have you second guessing your first choice.  The ingredients are fresh, but ordinary and nothing special.  The food is good, but a bit pricey for what you get.  Expect to be charmed by the ambience, but not wowed by the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! So good!! Fresh food, made to order. Nothing taste pre-made.  I will definitely be back and definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"I have only been here once since I don't work nearby, but I live down the street.  I was really impressed with the creativity of the sandwiches and the nice people working here. Incredably fast service! I just recently heard they now have Saturday hours so I plan on stopping by after a bike ride."}
{"text":"Just okay. The sandwiches are good, but for the price you expect a little more sandwich. Not to mention delivery takes FOREVER. If you're in a hurry or actually hungry, I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, affordable and delicious lunch! The Italian Hero sandwich and Potato Cheese soup is my go-to combo for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Ladybug House of Sandwiches in Phoenix is a cute little spot covered in, what else, ladybugs.  It's definitely a grab-n-go place, with only four two-person tables inside the cramped room, which looks more like your mom's kitchen than a restaurant.  The sandwiches are painfully simple, on store-bought bread. There are two dozen types, though, ranging from the T.J. ($6.75), with honey-cured ham, cheddar, jalapeños and sprouts, to the Pinky ($5.75), with turkey salad, pineapple and walnuts.  I got the Veggie Deluxe ($5.75), with avocado, onion, tomato, lettuce, sprouts and cucumber. I opted for a juicy pickle instead of the chips the meals usually come with.  The sandwich was nothing fancy, but I received it in less than a minute. The speedy service, and the fact you can call in orders (with free delivery to most surrounding places, too!), makes it a great place to go if you're in a rush for lunch. And, once the weather cools off, the patio seating makes it a good sit-down place, too."}
{"text":"My company has ordered from here many times because of the delivery. They are VERY slow. Most of the time my order is missing items. Ive let it slide but after today Ive made my decision to not return. I ordered super early (like 10:40 and my order didnt come until 12:15. It was missing an item. The driver dropped it off at the front desk and didnt wait for me to arrive to verify the order. Im frustrated."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when a sandwich place is progressive and offers gluten free bread.  My sandwich (The Hawaiian) was fantastic and a great size for lunch.  The restaurant was clean and quaintly decorated for their lady bug theme.  All of the ladies provided good customer service and completed our order quickly.   This was a great find while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  aweome soups and sandwiches,  and free delivery! I love this place!"}
{"text":"We had bought a restaurants.com coupon so we thought we would checkout out. First, they seemed a bit disorganized and we were the only customers. I ordered the Black Forest sandwich hot. My wife ordered the chicken salad in a tomato. She thought hers was ok. Second, I assumed hot meant toasted; no hot means the bread was put in a microwave. The description included  provolone cheese. My sandwich came with some version of cheddar cheese. I should have known we were in for an adventure when my sandwich was being made and one of the \"cooks\" asked the other staff was provolone cheese was. I thought the sandwich was very small for the price: $6.99. We will not be going back for a future adventure."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. It is nice to be able to rave about it. The food here is always fresh and reasonable priced. I find the staff to be very accommodating and the choices plentiful. The atmosphere is bright like a lady bug; red,yellow,green,violet. Very clean. They have a nice patio and they deliver. Try it."}
{"text":"My first time ordering here. I had the Daily Deal special which was half a sandwich of my choice,  a salad of my choice and a drink. Everything was fresh and made to order. Also, very reasonably priced. Fast delivery, too. Definitely ordering from here in the future."}
{"text":"I have actually never been to their store but I utilize their delivery service frequently. They are 9 times out of 10 on time or early OR occasionally running late. Their sandwiches,salads, and soups have saved me countless times when I am trapped at work with no way to grab any grub. I order online which is easy!!! My coworkers can order and pay separately and ladybug delivers in one drop off. They are great. I will continue to use them!"}
{"text":"We utilized this company for a catered lunch group function for 40 people and I have to say, we are so glad we did. Our event was on a Saturday and even though they are closed on Saturdays, the owner still met with me to pick up the food at the predetermined time. Everything was neatly wrapped and marked and all the food was very fresh and met our expectations."}
{"text":"I love the food, when it's made right, the fact that I can't call in and get a correct order is mental. At least if you order through grub hub it's correct it just takes longer. Also if you call in the minimum needed to deliver is twice the amount as grub hub.   I wish you guys could be more organized so that customers can actually enjoy your food.   Makes me scared to order anything that originally has avocado because I doubt they would remember and I would end up in the hospital."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so homey and the sandwiches are so fresh. The fresh natural waters are a must try also want to point out this place is vegan friendly just say no cheese. Be sure to ask for the vegan mayo and dairy/egg free bread."}
{"text":"I love the ladies at Lady Bug - Very friendly and welcoming and some very good sandwiches, if to my economical self a bit pricey for what you get: Tuna Salad Sandwich (the tuna salad was REALLY good)  between good but ordinary - right off the grocer's shelves whole grain bread, side order of potato salad and large tea: $13.00 (Just how much IS that restaurant tax in Phoenix?).  Oh yes the sandwich did come with small bag of chips.  I ditched the potato salad and switched to a small tea and and came out to a few cents under $10.  They also showed me the extra courtesy of honoring the $10 coupon that I was unable to bring up on my sometimes-not-so-smart phone.  Sweet ladies, cute, distinctly feminine decor. Good sandwiches - but you may be surprised at your total."}
{"text":"We used the Yelp deal and ate for about $12. The dumpling soup was excellent, as was my Black Forest sandwich. The cookies were also a delight."}
{"text":"Sacks is my ultimate favorite sandwich shop, but since it was noon on Friday and I guarantee no parking at Sacks,I decided to give Ladybug a try. I got half chicken salad sandwich, potato salad and small tea. I was first surprised at how small the sandwich was for the price I paid. The chicken salad had way too much mayo. The potato salad tasted like it came from a tub and I actually seen the cookies in a store bought box and the soup from a box as well! It would be nice to see bigger sandwiches and homemade items."}
{"text":"Once again fantastic!!!! Thank you lady bugs, u are efficient and scrumptious! !!!! Look forward to my next meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely love the vibe of this place.   They're quick and considerate and even offered us a free drink from the cooler for our kids to help everyone be happy."}
{"text":"Choose for the free delivery, not the food quality.  If you are stuck working through lunch and neither pizza nor chinese sound good, consider this little place.  The food is good, fresh, and perfectly edible. For 6.75, you can get a half sandwich and big bowl of soup. A large soda is $1 more, and you can throw in a cookie for 75 cents.   My ladybug club sandwich was fresh and cold on store brand wheat bread. Ask for the bread to be toasted if you want a more substantial texture and mouth feel.  My potato cheese soup was hot with potato slices in it, comfortably bland, and incredibly filling.   Soda was crisp, bubbly, and not watered down at all.  Cookie was the star of the show - melty chocolate chips and soft center.  The food all together reminds me of something your mom would make you for lunch if she was in a hurry but still loved you.   Service was warm and friendly - add this to your list of choices for delivery. Skip if on foot!"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop. Excellent service, greet food and cute ambiance with all the little lady bugs."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place, and even though I work in South Chandler, I decided to travel the 20 miles one way up to Phoenix to try this place. The quality of the food was good, I ordered the Bogey. But, it did not have tomatoes on it. I only discovered this after I drove the 20 miles back down to Chandler.   I was extremely disappointed. I called to let them know (it's all about word of mouth these days ) and the lady was quite helpful and assured me I'd get a cookie next time I come in. But I won't come in again. I just won't take time to babysit and quality check sandwiches after I get them from here. 'Ain't no one got time for that.'  So I won't go again. I still believe the quality of the food is good, just make sure you check your order to ensure what you asked for is what you got."}
{"text":"Lady Bug is nothing special. I've had lunch here six or seven times. The portions are small considering the high prices. The hot roast beef sandwich with melted cheese is not much better than what I've had from an AM/PM microwave. The way they wrapped it to go, made the whole bun a soggy mess. There was hardly any meat on the bun. The potato salad tastes like Resers. The food isn't horrible, but for the money, you can do a lot better."}
{"text":"I work at a business down the street from this business so I thought I would check it out to see if it could become a regular lunch spot for me. Called in my order to try to save time and make it a quick pick up. They told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. When I arrived, 25 minutes later (with only 2 patrons in store) they had not even started my order. After waiting, I then asked if I could change out the included chips with one of their healthier chip options on display near the register. They told me \"sorry, that is extra.\"  After not preparing my order then making me wait without even a mumble of a \"sorry,\" they couldn't just swap out a bag of chips that probably cost them pennies extra? I will NOT be returning here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my go-to spot for lunch. The staff are very friendly and the prices are affordable. I would rather go here andknow that my food is made fresh vs. some nasty drive-thru for lunch."}
{"text":"Lady Bug is one of my favorite sandwich spots in Phoenix. This little place has been around for many years and still has not changed.  Every sandwich here has a cute little name to it. I love how they still keep a simple sandwich and turn it into pure deliciousness. They also serve soups and salads. It's a small cozy spot to come and enjoy a some lunch if you want a sandwich. There are a few different ones to choose from depending on what you feel like. I do recommend stopping by if ever in the downtown area of phoenix."}
{"text":"A great small sandwich shop near downtown.  They have a LOT of selection and creative sandwiches, and they carry what seems to be a million different types of bread.  Everything is ladybug-themed -- literally everything and they have ample seating both inside and outside.  The service is prompt and friendly.    I gave them three stars because the sandwiches themselves are small, and they come with a small bag of Lays potato chips.  Their cookies also seem like they were bought from Costco (but I don't know for sure).  I would love to see this place kick it up a notch by making their own chips and cookies!"}
{"text":"We were visiting a patient at the hospital across the street and stopped in for a \"non hospital cafeteria lunch\". What a great find so close. The place has a neat retro, neighborhood diner feel that is refreshing from all the chain, plastic, generic atmosphere and food you get everywhere else. We thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches on the patio. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ordered Ladybug for the first time for a work meeting.  Delivery was prompt and a very friendly delivery person that followed me upstairs with the food and unloaded it for me.  we had a lot of particular requests (pickles with the pickle juice, etc.) and every one was followed to the letter.  Supersoft yummy bread - egg salad was delicious - tomatoes and lettuce on sandwiches fresh and crisp -   My sprite was a tad flat - like the CO2 was running out  - but everything else was so fresh and delicious I didn't care!  We will be ordering again - definitely!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the Ladybug House brick and mortar, but from the posted pictures it looks like a cute spot.  This review is for their delivery service.    Someone at work handed me their take out menu one day and said that the sandwiches were decent.  I noticed prices were not too bad and there was no delivery charge.  Ordered the tuna sandwich - no mayo.  As I was told on the phone while ordering, they have only one delivery car so the wait may be a bit long, but actually it didn't seem that long at all.  Food arrived before \"lunch hour\" and I gave a nice TIP.  Delivery woman gave me a club card to receive a free sandwich after ordering so many.  I can't remember the exact number but most likely 10.  Sandwich was tasty.  The second time I ordered from Ladybug, I forgot to say no mayo.  Damn! Damn! Damn!  An ample amount of the shiny white stuff was between my sandwich and I was not happy.  Lesson learned, be sure to say NO MAYO when you order over the phone."}
{"text":"I'll tell anyone I'm a fan of Ladybug House of Sandwiches, never considered that someone would have a bad experience here.     Def a fan, i work very close by and if i really need they would deliver, \"yeah their that great\"  The place has expanded their seating area so if you have been there before def check the place out.    When I need a real sandwich I stop in here.   What a great place in phoenix to take care of the lunch time rush without going to Subway, (not saying i don't go there).      Yes there are summer time hours but once your a fan you'll know to be there on time.   Why ladybug house of sandwiches well, great meats, choice of different breads and I love the ladybug theme.    Everyone loves a ladybug, there pretty and color full.  Look to come here and start memorizing their names of a sandwich like the Charlie Brown Sandwich.  Small note, i put my business card in their bowl once and actually won!  I got half off for the whole office, thanks ladybug ladies your the best.    I love to boast about this place, unlike our friends Deana or MG, their hater reviews stick out like a soar thumb here, I can see why they have no friends on yelp.   People that rag on businesses never put their ace on yelp.   McDowell right across from the Banner Hospital  right smack in the middle of the whole campus of medical buildings and offices."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery,  food was here within 30 mins.   I ordered   the fruit cup. You can order it naked (plain) or topped (whipped cream, granola, and a cherry). most everything was ripe and yummy except for the honeydew, no biggie,  still five stars.   Roast beef sandwixh, can't remember the name. I ty needed mustard but was very big and meaty. I added a pickle just to be safe.  I would def. Order from here again.  Free delivery and no minimum on order.   I would post a picture, but i didn't think of that until after it was gone."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! Everything on the menu is unique and good! The new owners have introduced chicken posole on Mondays and that's given me reason to visit LadyBug more often! Posole is temperature hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and ordered a BLT. They were just opening up when I arrived at 11. She said they got a late start. I asked if it was still the same owner, Sherry, but she said no they been under new ownership for three years. The standards of the sandwich were definitely not the same as before. If you blinked you would miss the bacon in the sandwich. I also ordered avocado in the sandwich which was spread so thin I had to search for it. The new owners have definitely not kept the restaurant up to par. I will definitely not be back. I was very disappointed. My sandwich was definitely not worth the $10 I paid for it. This restaurant used to be booming with business now it is very slow and I know the reason why. I should've realized it was not as good when I pulled up and there were no cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Since the change of ownership awhile ago it's gone downhill.  Food is OK at best.  I'll be finding a new sandwich place."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Try the Charlie Brown sandwich, it's great on an onion roll."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are a bit simple, I was happy with my lunch but felt it was a little overpriced at $25 for two sandwiches, two cups of soup and two mini bags of chips. The woman at the counter was a bit surly, but it could have been an off day. I thought the decor was cute and tacky."}
{"text":"favorite sandwiches in all of phoenix!!! but let me tell you about the pozole and aguas frescas  absolutely delicious! & the owner is such a sweetheart to everyone who walks through the door! you must try this place!!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff... online ordering makes it easy to just pop in and pick up!  They are selling just good basic food here... not fancy breads or spreads or side dishes, but lots of choices.   A good sandwich and GREAT soup and SUPER people. GO LOCAL and go to the Ladybug!  There is a little patio, but we use it for take out for lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out with a co-worker and was really surprised! Had the tuna salad sandwich and it was amazing! Delivery was fast and the delivery man was really nice and friendly. The only problem I had with the order was the bag of chips. I expected a, \"normal\" size take-out bag, but was presented with a bag half the size and about what you'd expect on a crappy commercial flight. Overall the experience was good, but I'll only order a sandwich from them and nothing else."}
{"text":"We only went because they had a yelp special and I'm glad we didn't pay full price because I could make an equal, if not better sandwich at home. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Meh.... ordered via Grubhub in a pinch because I was running late and hadn't been to the grocery store...& I definitely won't again. With so many INCREDIBLE sandwich shops in Phoenix I don't see the utility in eating a sandwich that I could absolutely make better at home. Legit these sandys are on regular bread w/ scare toppings and chips 1/3 of the size of single serving chips you can buy at the store (think \"mini chip bags for grade school picnic\" size). Way way WAY too expensive for the quality of sandwich (not saying the sandwich was distasteful, I ate it, but sub-mediocre at best... AKA I would never pay money for that sandwich, more like a sandwich a friend would make you at their house... palatable, but not something you would pay for). Do yourself a favor and go to about any other sandwich shop in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for unique, tasty sandwiches using ordinary ingredients.  You get to choose from a bajillion different bread slices.    They have some awesome soups too!!! yum!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here for an office lunch. I used their online ordering system and a rep from the store called me to confirm my order. They were very timely and the food was good. The delivery woman was also very informational, she gave us some information about deals and gave us a card to track purchases for a free sandwich."}
{"text":"The girls who worked here upped it from three stars to four. They are super sweet! This poor place and me seemed to have a love hate relationship from the start. I have been trying to go here for a while but something always happened. It was closed, we decide to go elsewhere, my car broke down, etc. Well, today I was determined to use my Restaurant.com gift certificate to go. I had errands to run in the neighborhood too so I looked up the opening time and was promptly there at 9:00 am. Well, they were not open even though that is the time listed on their website and the front door. I then notice there is a little sign under the door etchings that say that they are not really open until 10am on Saturday. \"Arghhhhh,\" Jinxed again. lol-- okay so I leave and do some more errands and come back. I am at the door at 10am and it is still not open. If I was not a determined person and a stubborn New Yorker when it comes to trying new food places, they probably would have lost a customer.      The gal working there shows up at 10:02am and opens up. Their staff do not show up 30 minutes or more early so you might want to note that when you go. I then see that they have a fantastic Yelp check in deal too. Which deal to use? Decisions, Decisions? For some reason the internet is not allowing me to reopen the saved Yelp deal. No biggie, I go back to the Restaurant.com deal instead. (by the way this was an awesome deal for sure! 2 sandwiches for 5 dollars, 2 cookies and a drink too.)      The place is small and sweet with a cute sidewalk area too. The food was good, not great. I liked the sandwiches I had so I want to go back and try them all. Unique menu. I do feel the sandwiches are not overstuffed though. ( but I always think Carnegie Deli when I hear the words overstuffed sandwiches) I think their Chicken Salad is very good. One of the better ones in town. I also got a Charlie Brown to go. (Roast Beef and Cukes, \"Meh\" but how do you spice that up? ) I liked that they have Onion Rolls. I love Onion rolls. Yummy!!!!! Still not as good as NY ones though but what is? -lol ;) The cookies I had were good. ( Again, not great or to die for)      I liked the place and would definitely go back despite the messy way I finally got to enjoy it. lol. Since it is local owned I have to try to support local business. The food was good enough for me to want to keep coming back. I just think they should work out some of the kinks.      A special thank you to the two nice ladies working the counter."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and it is definitely my go to sandwich shop. The service is quick and friendly. The sandwiches which have changed over the years still can be ordered to perfection if you know what to ask for.  An all-american overstuffed with cukes and sprouts is my top sandwich. All the sandwiches used to come with sprouts and cukes by default forcing you to try something you probably would not do otherwise. I wish they still did because they definitely make it better.   I tend to stay away from the soup because it is too expensive for the size and while I love the chili the rest seem to be ho-hum compared to the god of soups( Subs By Jim r.i.p).  Every now and then they cater to our work and I get to sample the delights like the lady bug club or the charlie brown. All of their sandwiches are delicous and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here last week with my $10 for $20 Groupon. Their menu is a little uninspired with the standard sandwich items and a tiny bag of Lay's come with the sandwiches. All the other chips options they have are extra. For two sandwiches, two orders of soup and one tea, I think we ended up at about $26. Glad I had that groupon. My sandwich was just okay. Exactly what I could make at home so I was a bit disappointed. I tried the broccoli cheese soup and it wasn't bad, not great and I probably wouldn't get it again. While you could tell it was a locally owned and decorated place, it was cute but I didn't really like sitting at patio furniture inside. Personal preference I guess. Since nothing wow'd me and it was a bit on the pricey side, I probably wouldn't come back. Sorry Ladybug."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Their lettuce for the salads is old and brown and their sandwiches taste stale. There are so many other options in the area. Any of them are better than this place."}
