{"text":"This place was disappointing ...  I ordered the French onion soup which was just ok . I ordered also the mixed grill combo which really sucked... it came with frozen peas, carrots and corn... would not come here again [maybe will try their chicken wings ]. The meat was bland. If you are looking for good HK style food , New Fortune restaurant at Warden/Steeles is a much better choice. I hope my friend will not get sick from eating the medium sirloin steak that he ordered. I will let you guys know !!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for quiet sometime and price wise is fairly cheap and food is just average. I usually order their basket of wings with a pitcher of beer. overall its not a bad place to try it once atleast for your own experience. I would only go back just for the wings and beer that's pretty much it . cheers"}
{"text":"Passed by this place many times over the years but never went in until now. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it is on the inside. I like what they did with the Hollywood memorabilia, it's a more simple, natural and warmer take on the Planet Hollywood style decor. TVs scattered around gives you a variety of things to watch when the conversation slows. The atmosphere is quite casual and I easily felt at home. The staff were quick and attentive and the prices aren't bad at all. My friend got the wings and pitcher special, I got a set meal. He noted that the beer wasn't as cold as it could have been and was a tad flat, but the wings were really good and made up for that. Portions for mine were a bit less than I hoped but the food was good and inexpensive.
Next time I go to Market Village I'll definitely come by here again and try some of their other specials. Oh, and free wifi."}
{"text":"Place is sooo good, open late too for convienence 
Highly recomend ordering one of their combos if you are very hungry, their portion size is huge and it comes with soup and bread.
I am almost a regular here, I come here after work when there is nothing else open.
Everything I've tried on the menu is generally great"}
{"text":"First time here, good value, good food. All of us had a different kind of soup. Beef Brisket in Noodle Soup, Korean Beef in Noodle Soup, and Wontons in Noodle Soup along with my picky eater who got chicken. Nuggets and fries with ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Went in today for an early dinner around 5:30pm. 

SERVICE - HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. They are the reason I'm writing this review right now. We came into this restaurant because we heard the chicken wings and hk style milk tea were good. We didn't have any cash on us and saw they accepted mastercard/visa/amex with the stickers on their door. The service was very.. absent. The waitress never came back to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything. We saw her on two occasions; to order and to pay. As we finished our meal, we walked up to the front counter to pay by mastercard but the lady at the counter said no, their machine is broken. We didn't have any cash on us. Couldn't they have told us sooner, or before we sat? Or before we ordered?? We walked for 20 minutes in the rain looking for a bank to withdraw cash. When we got the cash and handed it to the lady at the front counter, she laughed and said, \"FINALLY!\". We told her we had to walk in the rain to find a bank because they couldn't tell us their machine was broken. She continued to laugh and smile and tell us that it wasn't her fault that the machine broke. We confronted her and told her the way she was acting was rude but she just continued to laugh. We stormed out, and left no tip. 

FOOD - We ordered the honey garlic chicken wings and hk style milk tea.  The chicken wings were gross. They were NOT honey garlic at all, even though they called it honey garlic. It was tangy and tasted sour. The fries were soggy and the gravy was cold, and almost had a jello-like consistency. The only thing I enjoyed was the HK style milk tea. 

Overall, I do not recommend going to this restaurant. The service and food was terrible and the people who work there simply do not care. All they want is your service and money, and it very evident from how they serve you."}
{"text":"The quality of the food isn't too good here, but for the amount they give makes up for it.  The place is pretty comfortable to sit in and has TV & wifi to keep you entertained while you wait for your order.  The only reason why I could give 2 stars is b/c the service from some of the people working there are pretty rude or simple minded."}
{"text":"This cafe has many good combos that include toast, eggs, and a choice of drink. The portion size is big and prices are low. Service is decent and the inside seems inviting.

Top: you can't access this cafe directly from the mall. You have to exit and find it outside."}
{"text":"This is the place my friends and I go to for a late night snack. We love how the late night specials are very inexpensive and the proportions are big enough to share. As a group we always order the wing basket and we choose the HK style. I give Hollywood cafe a three stars because it is open late and the food price is reasonable however sometimes their food is not that good. When the place is almost full the service is rather slow."}
{"text":"Service is medicore. 

Food is also medicore. I'd go here for a late night snack or if I was in a rush but definitely not a first choice for dinner. 

Prefer other HK style restaurants in Markham a lot more."}
{"text":"Went to order a baked seafood on rice for take out.  I EXPLICITELY asked the waitress if it comes with a fish fillet and fried rice.  She sounded a bit unsure, but then said yes.  Went home, and surprise surprise there is no fish fillet in there.  Clearly, the waitress doesn't know the menu.  As for the fried rice, it tasted and look like white rice until I dug through it and found a tiny bit of egg in it, meaning it was the dampest, most unflavorful, whitest, stingiest, saddest fried rice I have ever come across.  This is a shame, as plain friend rice is pretty much Chinese cuisine 101.  Lesson learnt: I won't be going back for any baked casserole ever.

PS.  I almost forgot.  A soup and a drink came with my meal.  The cream soup base was nice, but there was so little corn in it I felt like I was drinking cream soup stock.  The hot horlick was so watered down it makes me cry."}
{"text":"The customer service and the food are decent. I prefer this location more than the newer one (Cafe Hollywood) due to the fact that this one feels more cozy and the service is faster. I would recommend the club sandwich for breakfast and the chicken meal for dinner or a midnight snack with friends."}
{"text":"Long wait time. Slow and Terrible Service. 
Food is nothing special. 
Not worth to try unless you want disappointment."}
{"text":"Really affordable and the food is good too! The portion is good. We always get the combo that comes with bun, soup, tea/coffee. Check it out when you're near p-mall!"}
{"text":"I come here and always order the usual; Garoupa Casserole w/ Cream Sauce combo ($9.95) with hot Horlick ($0.25 extra)"}
{"text":"Great place for some cheap wings and a jug of beer after a long day. Atmosphere is what you'd normally expect for a Chinese caf√©, which is nice in itself. There's plenty of Tv's around to watch any game that may be on or at least to catch up on the current Chinese drama. Overall a great place to hang out with some friends and relax, and it's right beside pacific mall which you can head over after to walk off the chicken. Only complaint would be a bit if lack of seating during peak hours, but that's to be expected when you're right next to pmall."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for anyone, whenever I'm there, I see teenagers, families, and people watching sports. My friends and I love coming here for food because the prices are relatively cheap, portions are reasonable and the food is good. 

Service is pretty typical of what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. There seems to be a lot of people working but it's quite hard to get their attention sometimes. 

This location is pretty small and not very good for groups over 6 people.

I would recommend trying the French Toast, Baked Portuguese Chicken on rice, sweet potato fries, regular fries and the happy hour wings set"}
{"text":"This place is just normal cafe food - the food is decent but not amazing. The only thing I come here for are the complimentary dinner rolls - they are soooo good. The Russian Borscht (tomato cabbage) soup is also a must try. However, the place is old, I remember coming here as a little kid and it has not changed. The service isn't great either. However, I would come back for the dinner rolls and soup, it is also opened a little past midnight which is great. I would also recommend it just because it's one of those local Scarborough Chinese places everyone has tried at least once."}
{"text":"This location is the older one located right at Market Village. It's been around for as long as I can remember. The decor is a little old, but it's called Hollywood because the they try to make it Hollywood themed. There's a newer location that opened just up the street too. The menu at this location has more variety and in my opinion the food here is better. 

The food is cheap here, which is why I always come back. They're opened late and beer is cheap too. The staff is okay, some of them don't speak English very well, but manage for the most part. 

I always get their A basket of wings and fries HK style (you can choose from a variety of 5 different styles/flaviours) and gravy. The basket is about 2.5 pounds of wings for $25.99, but it's $16.99 if you order a pitcher of drink (i.e. ice lemon tea, beer, pop, etc). So it's definitely work getting the  pitcher of drink. The HK style is best type of wing here! It's crispy, juicy, and flavourful! The fries are also like McCain crispy  fries. They have a lot of combo meals too. Basically an entree, soup, and drink. They serve mainly Hong Kong style cafe food (i.e. noodles, baked spaghetti, baked rices, etc). 

This place is good for groups and families. They take reservations and also give your entire party 10% off on your actual birthday date (proof of birthday required). I would say the food here is a solid A - OK!"}
{"text":"I always come here to eat and there was a lot of people today, understandable as it is family day, but my sister and I walked in and no one assisted us. Any one else that walked in was assisted, so my sister and I left and went back in. Still no one to assist us, my sister and I just decided to leave and go somewhere else to eat instead."}
{"text":"Staff here are fine, at least they are more polite than their other restaurant located at 7240 Kennedy Road, Markham, ON L3R 7P2. If you must try Cafe Hollywood, go to this one because the other one has forgetful and rude waiters. The food is average and prices are fine.The only complaint I have is their portions and take-out. The portions for some meals are just not worth it at all as there is very little and their meat is very thin.For the take-out, I was very disappointed. When you get a meal you usually get it with a drink, soup, and bread but for take-out you only get a drink. I couldn't care less for the drink, I would rather have their bread and soup. Overall, if you have money to waste, come to Cafe Hollywood."}
{"text":"I only go here for the wings, fries and gravy special for I believe, $15.

It's a huge basket with ... Well, wings fries and gravies, with different sauces for you to choose from! It's enough for two people!

When I'm not in the mood for wings, I will buy their Hollywood Mixed Grill. Which is bacon, one short rib, a hot dog, a pork cutlet and a chicken cutlet with rice. It's a lot, but hey, it's only $12.

Service is a hit and miss. Be wary."}
{"text":"My party of 5 got there around 12:45PM on Saturday and were quickly seated without needing reservation. We decided to share two orders of the 20 wings, fries & pitcher deal (which I think was about $16.99). We got the honey garlic and garlic pepper flavours for the wings and we got milk tea and lemon iced tea pitchers. Food was served quickly and 40 wings was sufficient for 5 people - great deal with quick service!

Tip: The restaurant can't split the bill based on headcount and could only split based on orders or not at all."}
{"text":"Far from fancy but close to heart.

Food: 4/5 Typical HK caf√© style.
Service: 2/5 Slow, flustered and hates eye contact.
Environment: 3/5 Fun but old and needs cleaning.
Washrooms: 2/5 Tiny and not wheelchair accessible.
Worth it?: 4/5 Good when it's late and nothing's open.

Opened until 1pm. (only this location)

This place really takes me back to highschool days when we couldn't afford much. Since then nothing has changed. The menus are still those laminated and binded sheets with fake magazine covers. The decor of celebrities memorabilia still sit there undisturbed. This place is very much a time capsule of those easy days. Hollywood could really use a remodel but it's a shame it won't be around much longer. 

So the food hasn't changed. It's very much your typical HK caf√© style food. I mostly go for there late night deals and I believe that is their most popular menu. The waffles with ice cream are very good and the smell quicky spreads across the room. Their bucket of wings special is also very popular. ($16.99 or $9.99 with a pitcher of anything) Spaghetti bolognese and Portuguese style chicken on rice are still my favorite. They are both filling and perfect for those late night eats. 

The drinks are very good here whether you are looking for something alcoholic or not. They only have 1 beer on tap but a decent bottle selection. (no craft beer tho) They have many different ice/milk tea options as well as other interesting mixes. Try the lemon ice tea if you don't know what to get. 

City Hollywood gets very busy at night. So much so that service starts to ignore all their customers and avoids eye contact. It takes a while to get seated at times and once you're seated it takes a while to get your orders in. Orders come out as they are made and don't come out all at once. Food could be served during a one hour time frame. They also seem to mess up orders more often than not. 

I will be returning to this place not only because it's opened later than most but I also want to enjoy it while it's here. Market village, the mall that it is in is being torn down to make way for a new complex in September 2017. There is the new location located down the road on 7240 Kennedy Road but it is not the same. Good bye old friend."}
{"text":"There are two reasons why I continue to go back to Hollywood. 

1. The food here is so cheap. In my opinion everything is quite affordable AND the portions are more than enough

2. Although I will admit that the food they serve can be easily made at home and they don't offer anything exceptional .. It's tastes fine and I'm content :)

I don't pay attention to the TV service they have but I know a lot of people go to Hollywood for it. Good place to go with a group of friends and enjoy the game"}
{"text":"Really enjoyable. There is a menu with 5 options as \"specials\". The food comes quite quickly, but the servers are usually busy. There's always a lineup of around 2-3 tables during lunches and dinner time. The Cutlet pork ramen is my favorite!

There's after-work specials, such as a basket of wings are a dollar if you buy a jug of a drink."}
{"text":"Great value for your dollar. You get slightly a better value for what you pay for. This is a typical HK style cafe with rock bottom pricing and decent quality food. This place is a high volume type of restaurant so don't expect quality customer service. This restaurant is good for a quick dine in. The baked rice black pepper sauce with chicken or baked seafood on rice is usually my go to when I come here."}
{"text":"I usually come here when I ever find myself in the Pacific area which is rare.  City Hollywood has been at Market Village forever and I can tell why.  Their food is tasty and price is amazing.  I love their afternoon tea especially the chicken wings and french toast.  The place is nicely decorated with western movie items. but can be crowded as the place isn't that big."}
{"text":"Worst HK style cafe in Toronto that I have visited thus far. Why did I go? Because it was conveniently located at the side of market village.

Service is minimal here. Sometimes they would even glance your way.. And then walk the opposite direction. Food here is also .. Meh. We were given french toast made out of DAYYYYSSS old bread. It was basically hard and had no fluff to it. They had to deep fry it so much to cover up the oldness as crunchiness.. It just tasted like something soggy that was deep fried. Was pretty disappointed. I've seen cheaper, older looking HK cafes do a whole lot better.

Noodles just had a ton of MSG. It took forever for us to ask for and for the waitress to bring us hot sauce. 

Don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Best thing is the chicken wing baskets!"}
{"text":"This place has a eclectic feel in terms of their decor, which works very well here. The are posters autographed by The Beatles, pictures from Chinese movies, and flat screen TVs all around broadcasting sports.

The food is also eclectic, with everything from baked chicken in Portuguese sauce to curry beef to hamburgers. The prices are generally very reasonable, and the portions are quite generous. The staff here is also usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"A great place to eat when it's super late or if it's your birthday (hello 10% discount). The food isn't bad here but don't expect good service especially if they're crowded. The servers often look overwhelmed when guests are consistently rolling in and they might ignore you and avoid eye contact but eventually they'll seat you if it's busy. 

The menu is vast and they have a good selection. The prices are cheap as well. The food is good and you can get some pretty good deals for afternoon or late dinner. They also have a popular 20 piece Wings special for $16.99 or if you grab 1 pitcher of any drink the special is $9.99. I've seen lots of people order this. Hollywood also offers all day breakfast for under $10 -- bread, ham and egg plus a macaroni dish of your choice. :) 

Overall I would come again as a late night snack if I was hungry as they are open until 1:00 AM and on weekends, 3:00. :)"}
{"text":"Not the best Hong Kong style restaurant that I have been. Although the setting of the restaurant is quite nice as it has several TVs and movie posters to replicate the Hollywood style decor, the food is below average. 

First, I ordered a grilled chicken spaghetti. The chicken was not fully cooked as I could see red color in the meat. Though the redeeming factor is that the restaurant was quick enough to give us a new dish when we raised the concern. 

Second, we ordered a dish for take out (not as a set but just the dish without soup and drink). The restaurant erroneously charged extra as we ordered a complete set. Again, this is human mistake."}
{"text":"We tried it tonight, food were great, great atmosphere, 4 stars. The reason why its -1 is they didn't told us that requesting a take out box and a paper bag is a $0.25 charge on the bill..."}
{"text":"They created a new menu recently, and I found they removed my favourite chowder soup special after 10pm. So sad!

They charged you extra money for a container if you cannot finish the meal! Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to have to write such a crappy review about this place; as I used to come here all the time. 

This past week, we have been at this location 3 times. Mainly for their wings and pitcher of beer combo. The first two times were great, we tried the hk style wings and curry wings our first time and the second time hk style wings and pepper and chilli. The wings always came out battered but delicious. It was soft and the meat was cooked perfectly. We go to the market village location and the newer location as well. We NEVER complain and whether we get good service or sometimes mediocre (due to volume) service, we always tip 20% because we enjoy eating at these two locations.

Yesterday night is by far the worst service I have ever received. 

It was a Saturday, November 7th, 2015 around 1030pm. I wanted to bring our friend to try out the wings since we were raving about. We decided to also order the baked spaghetti which we always get. It was the first thing that came out and unfortunately, didn't taste as good as cafe hollywood. There was no cheese and was bland. Our wings came out afterwards and it looked different from the last two times we came in this past week. It looked like the breading was hard or old (old oil maybe you should change the oil instead of being cheap asses), or too much breading. 

So we taste one and it didn't taste the same. I've looked through pictures on here and that's how our wings were cooked this past week. But I wish I took a picture of last nights wings, they looked dark, over cooked and the breading was seriously not the same.

We made a polite inquiry about the wings to our waitress and she gives it to the manager. The manager at the back counter tries one of our wings. He then comes to us explaining that he can't do anything about it and that there is nothing wrong with wings. We explained that we came here for the past 2 days this week and the wings didn't look or taste the same. So he tells us he's going to try to get the kitchen to do it again but that's it. After that we have to pay for it. 

Before the wings come out a second time, he comes back up to the table with the chicken wing and starts to eat it in front of us. While chewing with his mouth open, he tells us that there is nothing wrong with the chicken wing, look i'm eating it and there's nothing wrong with it. I don't know about you guys, but restaurants (chinese or not) don't take the food that you've ordered and eat it in front of you guys explaining that there's nothing wrong with it. 

It should have stopped when we told him we are regulars, and the worst part is that I've seen him at the newer location and he probably doesn't even recognize us. We go every sunday and it's such a pain to try and find something convenient like that around our area.

Last but not least, as I was paying the bill with the debit machine, he expected me to put in the amount myself on the debit machine. What a tool."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the price!! Extremely cheap, big portions and service is very fast. I got fried chicken noodles for only $6 and it was very filling! You can also grab refreshing and hot Hong Kong style drinks on the side for $1.50 or so. Worth coming again if you're in the Pacific Mall area!"}
{"text":"I've came here plenty of times as a kid, and I loved it. But ever so recently things just took a turn for the worse.

The place, looks, feels and tastes run down.

Food: quality was horrible. Ordered a beef curry combo, which looked fantastic as the picture in the broken menu, however the plate that came was nothing like the picture. The egg was too runny, the BBQ pork looked nothing like BBQ pork the curry was bland tasteless and only spicy. The \"steamed veggies\" are nothing but frozen peas and carrots thawed and sauteed in garlic. It was an embarrassment for sore eyes. My family got like a burger with a thin piece of pork in-between with chips YES LAYS CHIPS ON THE SIDE?? who does that?? 

Service: Everybody felt like they hated their job, there was no customer interaction, it's fast quick get your out the door so the next person can sit type of deal. I understand it. 

Decor: so run down, all the decorations are still there after 4 years. The flawed tv, the same posters and chalkboard art. Menus are severely broken and needs to be changed. Dirty Salt shakers as well.

CONCLUSION: I will not be coming back. Don't sell things if they're not nearly close to what the menu is featuring."}
{"text":"I pretty much grew up with this hk style cafe around, still looks the same for the past 10years plus. I still come here for their breakfast menu and occasionally daily lunch special. They have a huge selection of choices for breakfast and for cheap. Their food are ok (as expected for hk style cafe AND for that price). It could be a bit more consistent though... but service is usually pretty efficient. Just don't come here with high expectations and you'll enjoy your quick meal!!"}
{"text":"Came today for weekday lunch with husband.

He ordered Chicken A La King and I ordered lunch set of 2 choice of meat, pasta or rice, soup and meal drink. I chose pork chop and minute steak with spaghetti, black pepper sauce, cream soup and hot milk tea.

Judging from presentation, the meals looked fine. But look is deceiving. The food tastes bland. Hubby's chicken really got a frozen taste to it. My pork chop was tough and dry and minute steak was chewy with a corner that's actually raw. After learning about the potential effects of e-coli from mechanically tenderized meat on CBC Marketplace, I didn't want to take my chance with this cheap piece of raw beef although I normally like steak medium done. Black pepper sauce could be more tasty. Veggies on the side were the cheap mix you buy in a $0.99 bag at the supermarket, which I have no problem with at home, but does expect slightly better when I'm dining out. The soup was the usual watery tasteless white soup and they sprinkled some corn kernels in it. Hot milk tea, nothing special, had better down the street at Lai Doh in Spendid China.

Also, 3 corners of my rectangular plate was badly chipped and should really be thrown out.

I know when eating at a HK diner, you are usually eating a western style meal made with cheap meats and ingredients like hot dogs and luncheon meats. But it doesn't mean it can't taste good. I didn't enjoy my meals today because it tasted bland and like it was cooked by someone with no restaurant kitchen cooking experience, which I expect when I eat out.

I'm not usually a tough reviewer but one thing that does really affect my opinion of an eatery is service. Of course, at places like a HK diner, I'm not looking for over the top friendliness or attentiveness. If food comes quick, hot and the server wasn't rude, I'm happy. My food today did come quick and hot. However, the tone of the woman serving us sounds a bit hasty for no reason. Sounded like she was ready to snap at you if you dare ask for something or make a request (we just gave our order). I later heard a man ordering take out and when questioning what his options for meal drinks was, the server replied 'milk tea or coffee' but the tone sounded more like 'it's coffee or tea like always, what else were you expecting'.

I must knock off 1 star for quality of food and 1 star for the hasty sounding service. I could only give credit to this place for the somewhat cozy d√©cor. There are quite a bit of TVs on the wall, 8 I believe. Though their name is Hollywood, their wall d√©cor was a bit strange with a mixture of old Hollywood stars, HK movie posters, stuff from a pub like Toronto sport teams flags, game fish decorations like in fishermen' homes and instruments like tuba and flutes.

Parking wasn't good even on a weekend afternoon, hate to imagine what it's like on the weekend. Come here if you happen to be shopping here, otherwise it's quite inconvenient.

They seem to promote beer and beer foods a lot on the wall so I guess it's a good place to hang and watch a game (assuming they tune in to that) or late night hang out. A good bunch of magazines available on a rack and wifi (not sure how fast) and tea time specials daily.

I really want to like this place better, judging from other reviewers' good words and pictures and the cozy environment. From today's experience, I'm really reluctant about coming back. But maybe I would come back once more to try snacks like chili chicken wings or something. But today, it's 2 star. For a HK diner, better quality food can be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is a very good place to eat if you are looking for a simple Hong Kong style cafe meal.  I have been to this place many times and they have all been decent overall. I mostly come to this place for their Afternoon Tea Break special . I would recommend trying the chicken wings, they are done to perfection. The ambiance of this restaruant is decent , it could use a new facelift in terms of updating the decor to current trends. Overall, if you want a quick meal for reasonable prices, City Hollywood Cafe is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food is good quality and different (menu claims HK style, no idea how authentic). Wide range of foods from quick lunches to full dinners. Prices are fair and location is good (parking can be an issue on weekends). Seems like a HK version of ESM to me with retro decor."}
{"text":"I can't say City Hollywood Cafe has the best offerings but their chicken wing basket is bomdiggity (great description, right?). Located outside of Market Village, parking here during mall hours can be quite difficult, which is why I only go for their happy hour past 9:30pm. They offer extra crispy garlic pepper chicken wings, not only is it heavily coated, the taste of the garlic is infused into the wings.

I wish I could say the same about their new location though...

{"text":"Funny how when I cannot decide where to eat, and it seems like I have tried all the food places in the area, I would just end up eating at City Hollywood or its sister restaurant Cafe Hollywood.

This place would always be the last resort.

City Hollywood, compared to Cafe Hollywood has a much much faster service however, and is the better one of the two.

As soon as you come in, you can pick any seat you want. I find that whenever I go here, the place is never busy.

I ordered corned beef sandwich. My BF ordered beef with rice.

Food came in like 3-5 minutes! This has got to be the least time I have waited for food when eating out! It's almost like the food was pre-made and they just had to warm it up in the microwave!

For $3.50, the corned beef sandwich was pretty much empty. Barely any corned beef in it. But somehow the food comes with fries and salad, which I do not like about this place! This is the only restaurant that adds sides to sandwiches and barely puts anything in the actual sandwich! Not cool! I ordered a corned beef sandwich only, and I did not want the tasteless fries and salad! Put more corned beef in your sandwiches, City Hollywood!

The beef stroganoff with rice ($6.95), however was pretty good in quality. Therefore plus 1 star.

The first star was for fast service and cheap prices.

Like I mentioned earlier I would probably come back if I run out of restaurant ideas and just want to get a quick bite.

{"text":"Mediocre - that's the word. Passes for a day to day restaurant. Fairly priced for what you get. Speedy service - good! A bit too speedy though: took my cucumber and tomatoes before I got to finish it. And I had no chance to tell her \"no\" because she had me when my mouth was full. Decor, out dated, requires repair and cleaning. Patio seems to never be used - what a shame."}
{"text":"City Hollywood Cafe is the place to go if you're broke af and need some substance food in your stomach.
Haha... no but really.

They have cheap deals - breakfast is only like $4-6 and that includes bread, entree, two eggs, small salad (aka few lettuce leaves and a cucumber slice) and two slices of salty salty ham.. it's not bad. Oh, and you get a free coffee/tea with it. The food is not too bad, it can certainly fill you up without you complaining.
They also have larger dishes with a deal that gives you a free drink, bread and soup. 

Service is efficient although not the friendliest but then again, I don't expect much. As long as you don't throw a platter in my face, we're good."}
{"text":"Love coming to this cafe for their big dishes but at an affordable price. Their menu is really big so there are lots to choose from even for the picky eaters. 

I enjoy their decor because there are a lot of interesting artwork or small things hanging around the restaurant that is great to look at. There are also several monitors so you can come and watch sports game while hanging out with friends and enjoying a beer. 

Their food I would have to say is usually a hit or miss for me. Sometimes it's really good or pretty bland and dry, but it's good comfort food that is close and local to the area."}
{"text":"A pretty good caf√© if you want decent HK Style brunch and food. Hollywood is known for their wings and it's usually something I get every time I come here or for a late night meal. A basket of wings is like 20 for $16.99 or $9.99 if you buy a pitcher of drinks. There are about 5-6 flavours on the menu and my favourite ones are the Chili pepper and curry ones. Simply delicious and I would highly recommend those flavours. The prices for their food here are generally very affordable and you can pretty big portions for what you pay here. It can be busy on weekends especially in the evenings but for the most part you can get a seat in the restaurant. Staff are alright but sometimes the service isn't the best when the restaurant is super busy and the food tends to take a long time. Hollywood has been in the local for a while so many people know this caf√© Overall, a decent restaurant to go or simply hanging out with friends while enjoying a good meal and some beer!"}
{"text":"went here for the first time and gotta say the food was very bland and flavourless. i ordered the clam chowder and grilled chicken stewed ramen. 

first off, i was expecting the ramen to be in a soup base and the chicken to have you know the grill marks and all that but when i got it, the ramen had no soup and the chicken looked like it was simply fried in a light batter.... like i seriously wouldn't have ordered that if it was fried

second, the clam chowder was seriously bland and the \"clams\" tasted weird to me. i had clam chowder when i was in Disneyland and it was the most blessed thing I have ever eaten but this, does not even compare by 1% . 

overall, would i come back again, no! but what i can say to all you people interested in going is that it's quite affordable and the portion is quite good. oh and a little word of advice, i heard its best to order from the all day breakfast section of the menu"}
{"text":"HK-style cafe with a Western twist. I have frequented this restaurant many times in the past, but I had a surprisingly pleasant dinner experience when I came in with a group of friends. 

The waitors aren't exactly the friendly type, but they're quick in serving, clearing the table, and refilling the tea. In fact, their service was so quick that the main dish came within minutes after the soup/dinner rolls were served! We had to ask them to slow down. 

Combos come with a choice of soup (minestrone-type or cream of mushroom), dinner roll w/ butter, main dish, and HK tea or coffee (or lemon tea, if requested). The main dishes come in generous portions, especially for the price that you pay for. I found their baked dishes to be consistantly good.

City Hollywood Cafe has a nice ambience and decor. Spot lightings, filmstrip designs on the wall, TV screens at every corner, menus designed like a magazine. 

Overall, this restaurant has been consistent in the way it is managed and the food they serve. Not the best, but I wouldn't mind coming back from tiem to time."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came for a FIFA game and some food. The atmosphere is awesome especially with everyone in jerseys and the restaurant is all decorated and there are plenty of TV's! We came late afternoon and got a afternoon tea combo as well as the yummy wings combo. Their hong Kong style wings are spot on and u get a pitcher of any beverage- great for sharing. The deal is only $8.99- so awesome! You can opt for beer as well. 
If you are looking for some good HK food, you will be happy as there is everything you can imagine. There are also pictures in the menu and really good breakfast, lunch and dinner specials. Food is good and value is definitely the thing to point out here.
I don't always come here as the location is far, wished we still had this place in sauga!"}
{"text":"With a mix of cafe, restaurant, and bar menu City Hollywood Cafe has the ability to accomdate whether you're here for snack, dinner, drinks, or bar food.  With its Hollywood movie inspired decor collaborated with some sports banners, this place seems to have a mish-mash of everything.  
They've got their daily specials ranging from $7-12 which includes soup of the day, and drink with your meal.  
If you're feeling more on the fatty foods after a big game they've got their DAILY happy hour from 1pm-close: $14.99 for 20 wings & $8.99 for pitcher of beer!! which is quite insane, hence i'll need to make a second trip.
The food!
I had the Hollywood mixed grill $12.50: chicken steak, pork chop, sausage, bacon, served with rice and mixed. My meal included soup (Russian Borsch, or Cream soup) and tea, coffee, or soda.
Overall this place seems cozy, perfect for all ages, and the staff are friendly. I could consider this place among my local hangouts, especially in the summer with its patio! :)"}
{"text":"Hollywood is okay. It's a cheap, quick, Hong Kong style diner beside Pacific Mall that is open early until late. 

They have a small all day breakfast menu where you get noodles, eggs, bread, ham, and a drink for $5.49. If you go before 11am, there is a bigger breakfast menu to choose from (like the fried chicken thigh vermicelli rice noodles).

Their lunch menu is really big and kind of hard to choose from, not because everything sounds good, but because a lot of it just seems 'meh'. Although I heard that some of the casseroles are pretty good, you should probably never order any of the udon/ramen items as they literally just put a block of ramen in hot water for you.

Surprisingly, Hollywood Cafe has some of the best wings I've had in Toronto. The salt and pepper dry wings are always cooked to perfection, as in, you can pull both bones out cleanly for speedy and impressive wing consumption. They also come with fries and gravy! The portions are large, so when we order wings ($14.99, I believe), we are usually able to share between 2-3 people and be full after.

This is a good place to come with friends or for cheap food, they even serve alcohol. Unfortunately, you can't really watch games here as their TVs are all set to mute."}
{"text":"Good value for the price.  The breakfast is filling with your order of entree and side of eggs and ham.  The milk tea is good too.  For under $10 per person, the quality and quantity compliment each other.
It is hard to get the attention of the staff sometimes though, we were sitting in the booth two rows in front of the utensils station, and no one saw me trying to get my tea refilled."}
{"text":"Been here many times and bring my friends here often.   Never disappoints and the wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"A very good place to eat for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner and midnight. Decorations are old styles but with an unique finish. Their televisions are awkwardly sideways but watchable.

You really get your money's worth for the food you get. Has all day breakfast options and many afternoon tea, lunch, dinner and midnight snack options also.

I would come here occasionally when I do not know where to eat.

Overall this is a great place with edible food. They get 4 stars for food and service however lose one for terrible phone reception, they do compensate this with their slow free wifi. Would give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"food was so bland here . its really cheap but not as cheap as some of the other HK style western food places around the area . i'd rather eat at the food court inside market village/pacific ."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for lunch and afternoon tea. It definitely offers what you would expect to see in a typical HK style cafe. But their food is more on the western style than HK style like spaghetti baked with cheese in a meat sauce.

They do have quite a bit of specials including breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and all-days. With each category of specials there are quite a variety of selections you can choose from where all combos include a drink.

The atmosphere and how the restaurant is decorated is fairly nice and comfortable. It feels clean and cozy too. How the restaurant is designed, you can basically see the whole restaurant from mostly anywhere you sit so it never really feels you're in a corner or confined space. There's quite a few of TVs mounted along the walls as well as a bar (looks pretty nice) right in the centre of the back wall, so you can see both things no matter where you sit.

This time I went during the afternoon on a weekday for afternoon tea. Maybe since it wasn't considered busy, as over half the restaurant was full, servers did not notice us standing at the front waiting to be seated. There were plenty empty seats but we didn't get sat until a bit of a wait.

We ordered a satay beef noodle with an iced milk tea and a french toast with an iced lemon tea. Cold drinks are extra $0.70 which I find reasonable since most other HK style cafe charges $0.75. We got our foods fairly quick but the looks of it was EXTREMELY not appealing. I guess you can't be expecting too much since all you're paying is a couple of bucks which includes a drink.

So the noodle literally just looks like noodle in a bowl with soup and a big scoop of satay beef on top. The noodles were not cooked in the soup because it was all stuck into a ball when I was trying to mix the satay sauce into the soup with the noodles. It was just not very satisfying when your noodle is stuck in a ball and when trying to shake it loose into the soup, it just breaks, not what I have in mind as \"noodles\".

THE FRENCH TOAST WAS WORST!!!!!!
WORST french toast I've ever had in my life!! For a second I was doubting myself if what I was eating was actual food!! 
The toast wasn't hot when it arrived at the table, it was warm. You can tell because all the butter have melted already on the toast and dripped all along the sides already thus it must be sitting for awhile. As soon as you cut into it, it was hard and tough and also maybe because the knife we were given wasn't sharp at all. As soon I bit into it, it was hard and tough like a piece of cardboard, difficult to chew. If you have tried to squish toast into it's flattest form and eating it, that's EXACTLY how it tasted inside but instead imagine it's not only 1 piece, it's like 4 pieces stacked because it's 2 pieces of thick toast put together. The outside of the toast is suppose to be crispy or crunchy since french toast is to be fried, but it was hard like cardboard. It was just EXTREMELY disappointing. We didn't complain because we were in a hurry so we didn't even bother finishing it.

The ice lemon tea and iced milk tea were of standard no complains on that.

As we wanted to get the bill, we had raised our hands but still waited over 5 mins for a server to catch our attention. Reason is I see a few servers at the side stands just chit-chatting away, a server just chatting with their friends at a table. It just wasn't the best experience and I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND this place yet coming back again!

Overall if you are trying to find some place CHEAP and doesn't mind NO SERVICE or waiting for awhile, then this would be a place to consider or else there's plenty of other choices in the area!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 2/5 (typical HK style restaurant)
Price: reasonable 
Food: 2.5/5 
What we ordered: 
1. the Korean beef ramen ( there was 2 slices of beef with actual instant noodle ramen, came with drink ) 5.50 

2. 20 piece wings and fries deal, we got honey garlic, wings were crispy, saucy and YUMMY. 14.99 

They're open late, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food quality is good and service is very fast. They seem to like putting potato chips on your breakfast plate which I find strange and personally do not like. Doesn't make it a bad place though, just different. :) 

We go there on many Thursdays after meetings. It's fast service, great staff, clean space and good value. We return almost every week."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a friend to grab some late night bite on Sunday. I am glad they open late which is good. They open up to 1 am. We ordered the wings. Fried wings. NOT healthy the food is very not healthy. I donot mind the wings not the best wings I had but they are OK. The gravy was bad which came with it I really did not like it I will recommend KFC or any other gravy that this one.
Over all the place is decent but not healthy the water in the washroom was very cold too which pissed me off for this time of the year as it is cold out there. 
I only tried one plate was not a big fan of it but they seem to have other cheap food and very low prices. That sounds interesting to try."}
{"text":"For about 15yrs I still hate this place. The most important is the service. The waitress and waiter is rude!!! You ask for little more and you can tell there expression that they don't like it. The food isn't good either. The only reason I come here is because my friend want me to meet them here. The place is too crowded. Please train your employees !!! They are mostly kids."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend on a Sunday night because she hadn't come for a long time. It was fairly busy so that was a good sign.  The decor is very \"Hollywood\" themed so I guess that goes with the name of the place. It's a little dated though and with old comes worn-down but it was fairly clean for an HK style restaurant. Servers were friendly although some struggled with English.

We both got a set menu dinner that came with soup (cream or borcht), a small salad with french onion sauce and a sweet dinner bun with butter and shared a basket of deep fried goodies. Soup and bun were standard. Buns were warmed so that was nice.

I got the Short Ribs in Black Pepper Sauce served with rice and a side of vegetables (around $7.99-8.99). I was surprised that I got three rows of at least 5-6 sections of meat! The flavour was good, just a tad salty but it was pretty tough. It could have been cooked longer needless to say. But portion wise, I feel like I got my bang for my buck.

My friend got a Pan-fried Chicken in Garlic sauce served with spaghetti and vegetables ($7.99ish). Again, portions were very big for the price. She got a very big piece of de-boned thigh and drumstick and a piece of chicken breast slathered in garlic sauce. (If you like garlic then you should always get the garlic sauce). My friend liked the sauce so much that she mixed it up with the spaghetti, and even when she couldn't finish it she wanted to bring it home. The meat was tender, flavourful and not too salty. 

The basket of deep fried food included: chicken wings, chicken nuggets, fishballs, onion rings, fries and bacon wrapped hot dog pieces which came with a bowl of gravy ($14.99). The things I didn't like were the chicken nuggets because they tasted kind of old like freezer burned, the skin of the fishballs were TOUGH LIKE LEATHER and the bacon wrapped hot dogs were so salty and they weren't really special at all. Alternatively the wings were good, the onion rings were VERY GOOD and the fries are like Costco fries which are self-explanatory.

I would go again for the amount of food, decent taste and their cheap prices."}
{"text":"Like Hollywood, City Hollywood cafe presents itself very nicely, but upon further inspection you will notice that it is not as glamorous as you thought it was. The interior has mostly remained unchanged throughout the years and the interior is dim lit. A couple of the seats in its booths are ripped and seating in general is not the most comfortable here.

Food - 2/5: presentation of the food is nice, but once you actually eat it, you realize it is quite the opposite. I had the \"minute steak\" meal and although i wasn't expecting steak at all (tbh i don't know what i was expecting), what i received was a 3mm thick slice of beef that was drier than sand on a bagel. The meal came with a soup and bread as well, where the soup was noticeably watered down. The highlight of the meal was probably the lemon iced tea, which is impossible to screw up.

Price - 3/5: you pay for what you get I guess, but paying $10 for a bad meal that is still paying for a bad meal. Especially when there are superior options nearby for the same price.

Service - 3/5: most of the waiters there were nice but one in particular was a little subpar. However, it was understandable since it seemed that the restaurant was understaffed  (3-4 waiters/waitresses for a Sunday night before a holiday)

Overall i probably wouldnt return unless i was getting wings or something. Even then i would rather go to wild wings or Big BoNe BBQ"}
{"text":"So this is my first time coming here with a recommendation from a friend. 
It's 10:20pm, place is pretty calm. 
A server guy came up to us.  Did not introduce himself.  However the way he groomed himself was very poorly.  Would not want to be served by a guy like him. 
We ordered honey garlic chicken and Hong Kong style and spaghetti bolognese. 
First of all the honey garlic chicken.  It was good at first,until we noticed a huge feather.  Picture attached. Gross. There's also fries buried under the chicken wings. When I first tried the fries,  I thought I was the only one who tasted ketchup. Ketchup? I didn't think it through because I thought it was just the sauce until one of my friend also pointed it out that he tasted ketchup. So we all assumed,  left overs. 

Hong Kong style chicken,  it looks like it was cooked twice because all it looked was skin and bones.  We barely touched it,  only ate the fries because it was that bad. 

Last but not least,  the spaghetti bolognese was the only decent dish. 

Next time we go out,  this place is definitely not the place. :)"}
{"text":"The price is cheap amd portion is large. I come here because it's pretty near to my house. I ordered a ham and egg rice , andlast time I ordered steak and chicken rice. Both times thedish came with a cold rice, I meannot that hot. It is pretty werid that the rice is not hot at all! 
   The worst thing is. The chef salad's chicken has GONE BAD! How can a restruant servrve a bad chicken that is not fresh?"}
{"text":"I've known about this place for years but never thought to try it out until recently. The moment you step through the front doors, you get hit by a wave of nostalgia and you knew that this is the right place for a HK breakfast. It's seeped in the early 90s decor, the full tables of patrons and the bustling nice-but-non-nonsense-efficient waitresses. The space was busy on a statutory holiday at 11am, fortunately spots turn over quickly and we were seated in 5 minutes flat. 

I got the full breakfast. A plate of two eggs beside two slices of ham with a bun and a bowl of chicken and mushroom 'ho fun' noodles. Of course, it comes with the almost necessary coffee or milk tea. This all came out to be less than $8 after tax and tip!! Not the most amazing breakfast you will ever eat, but it's the right mix of HK breakfast comfort food, atmosphere and style. The service is fast and the food comes out promptly, so you can get in and out quickly if you wanted to."}
{"text":"I had the Korean Seafood Noodle Soup which was just spicy instant ramen noodles with a mussel, baby shrimp, and some other fish pieces. I hate spicy food so I was upset because the menu did not indicate this dish was spicy. It was only $4 but it was just instant noodles, straight from the pack lol. I also had their french fries with gravy ($3.50) and their fries are like the costco fries which are my favourite. They're good for a late night spot and all the prices are pretty cheap. But the food is mediocre if not a little less than mediocre."}
{"text":"Always love HK style food.  Started in 1994 for its first location in Mississauga.  Moved to Market Village after and now is first ever drive thru shop.  Affordable combos & comfort food.  Wings are MUST & great place to watch sport games with many LCD TVs.  Spacious design good for groups & families!  Will come back soon after its grand opening!"}
{"text":"We visited for cheap steak dinners.  

I ordered the sirloin steak special ($11.50) that included an 8oz sirloin steak, a roll of bread, a starter soup and a cup of hot coffee/tea.  The soup was diluted, but I liked that there was just a hint of sodium, meaning customers could adjust how salty they liked.  I asked for medium doneness for the sirloin steak and it was more like medium well.  The steak was obviously a well frozen steak.  the meat texture was nice and tender enough, but there was no taste whatsoever, meaning no blood taste and no salty taste.  This could be good for some who don't like much salt on their food.  For $11,50, I honestly cannot complain; it is not like they gave me rotten food.  The only 2 complaints I have are that 1) there is only white pepper; I prefer black pepper on my steak, and 2) the steak was overcooked.

The place was clean; the waiters/waitresses were fast and friendly.  The decor was cute but not much else.  The lighting could be brighter and more even.  

Overall, City Hollywood offers a good deal.  It is not good food, but not rotten food.  It fills hunger and fits budget alright."}
{"text":"This place is the best for cheap HK style food and has beem here forever. Quality is consistent and if you know what to get on the menu, you won't be disappointed. 

Usually I get a meal - shredded chicken and ham rice with cream sauce or spaghetti bolognese ($7-8 each). The malaysian curry is also quite good. I would not suggest the chicken a la king - quite bland. The meals themselves are quite simple, but very hearty. They are very generous with the sauces - maybe a bit too much but you can always leave the sauce on the side. 

Today we got wings, the 20 wings for $16.99. They were surprisingly quite good! I was surprised by the lack of sauce but I found that it worked. Western places usually drown their wings in sauce and sometimes it's a bit too much. Here they drizzle it on generously which I liked. I thought it would end up too dry, but it wasn't. Sauce options include honey garlic, HK style, peppercorn, and more. They also added fries into the basket of wings and a gravy.

Service when they're busy is quick and professional. Today they were a little less busy and the servers were super friendly when we asked them to take our picture. They joked around with each other and it was nice to see that they seem to be friends as well as coworkers. 

The decor is quirky with autographed posters and interestingly edited Hollywood and Chinese movie posters to get around copyright. There are few TVs usually playing sports and the news. Overall a good place to take a date, chill with friends or spend time with family.  Probably a 3.5 stars. Also the fries are good!! Sweet potato and regular fries."}
{"text":"Delicious HK cafe style food.  Great selection and variety.  I've been here several times and loved the entertainment magazine style menu and cool movie theatre style decor.

Today I had the all day breakfast combo D with satay beef vermicelli for $5.49.  It was good and enough to fill me up.  I'm rarely here for breakfast but i think i should come more often.  I thought they moved to the Burger King location up the street but i guess that must be a second location.

Free wifi, speed is pretty good.  Many TV's showing random things and Chinese pop music in the background.  Washrooms are clean.  Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside and it seems like this place is always busy. Service was pretty good for how busy they were on a Saturday afternoon. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table though. 

Baked grouper with spaghetti and cream sauce $9.95 - comes with choice of onion soup or cream soup. Nothing really stands out and its on par with other HK style diners. 

Baked seafood with rice and cream sauce $7.50 lunch special - also comes with choice of onion or cream soup. Very similar to the dish above but with more seafood.

Fried chicken platter $14.95 - comes with fish balls, chicken nuggets, hotdogs wrapped in bacon, fries and onion rings. Really greasy but worth trying out. The fried chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Great seasoning as well."}
{"text":"Average for a typical HK style cafe serving variety of \"western food\". The price was pretty good as there are \"afternoon tea\" and \"all day breakfast\" specials. On average you can get away with eating here for under $10.

The service isn't the best but the food is average and decent enough for me to come back perhaps for lunch or snacks. It is a place I'd go to if I wanted to save money, it's \"cheap\" on average."}
{"text":"City Hollywood Cafe used to be one of the premier HK style cafes, but it has arguably fallen by the wayside with all the new places that have opened.

The interior of the restaurant has largely remained the same, largely resembling a sports cafe. The menu has also largely remain unchanged, although they have different dinner specials every so often.

I had the baked escargots, followed by the ox tail in red wine sauce. My expectations weren't too high, as the price level was quite low. The cream soup that came with my meal was watery, but that's okay. The baked escargots were actually quite good, although a bit saltier than what I expected. Finally, the ox tail in red wine sauce was surprisingly flavourful, definitely a dish I recommend. I've obviously had better, but for $13.95 you can't really go wrong with the quality this dish delivers.

Service was forgettable, it wasn't easy to wave someone down at all, and a couple of times they forgot our requests. Overall, not a place I'd frequent, but if I were shopping in Market Village/Pacific Mall and want to eat a low cost meal (that's not food court quality), I wouldn't mind too much coming here."}
{"text":"After trashing the new location a bit... thought I'd come back here for a better experience since I've been eating here for many years. With that said... the last time i came was last summer with my family and i was already quite disappointed with the deteriorating quality of their food. TODAY... it was even more disappointing then last summer. I am completely giving up on this place. The food had no taste, stale and thrown together in like 10 seconds. (Afternoon tea and breakfast menu). The soup base was water plus a block of seasoning... and it wasn't even fully melted yet after I've finished eating. The only redeeming quality of this place is the ambience it maintained throughout all these years. They've got that friendly old Hollywood vibe going on and the service at this location is much better. And the fact that they served the liquid sweetener to my lemon tea separately also refrained me from giving it a depressing 1 star."}
{"text":"Their lunch special list for everyday is very worthy! The lunch includes soup of the day, bread, meal (several choices), and coffee or tea. Lunch price is from $5.99 to $9.99."}
{"text":"If this place is near my house. I probably would go there every morning to eat their breakfast so that i do not have to go to McDonalds. Too bad this place is too far from my house."}
{"text":"I came here to try their chicken wings special.Cheap and tasty and good to share with another person. Their are plenty of sauces to choose from, I tried the HK sauce and i wasn't disappointed. The service can be a bit better though, there were very few workers for a busy time. overall great experience."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Went into the restaurant with my sister and housekeeper.  Asked for a table for three then the maitre d turned to my sister and asked her the same question so I answered her they are with me then she made a gave a dirty look and told me to calm down. How dare her talk to me like that. Who does she think she is. I didn't answer her add she continued to explained the meal requirement since it's valentine's.  The restaurant is not full and we are the only patrons asking for a table at that time.  If she can't handle the patronage traffic on valentine's she should just quit. To cut it short,  we are totally not interested in their valentine's menu so we left.  Then we went to chuichow boy and had a most wonderful enjoyable meal. Hollywood cafe, I will not give you another chance.  You are finished and done with."}
{"text":"Nice cafe, gets crowded. Nice western-like atmosphere, but everyone is Cantonese. They have decent wifi and customized menus. 

Their portions are huge! Me and my friend had the All Day Breakky for only $5. I got Sausage vermicelli. It was a medium sized bowl which also came with eggs, ham, and bread. They also provide drinks, I had their hot milk tea. The food isn't spectacular, I mean it's a cafe so you shouldn't be expecting much. We did end up wasting a lot of food because they just gave us soo much! 

Definitely recommended to go in groups though! Great experience. 

PS. They dont accept Debit, only Credit and Cash."}
{"text":"I think it would be closer to a 3.5.

I love their wings basket that happily feeds 2-3 as a full meal. I usually opt for the sauceless original flavour that is flavourful and taste just like your childhood hk style cafe afternoon tea offerings.

I also enjoy your wide variety of dinner sets that come with a soup, dinner rolls and tea/coffee. The prices are slightly higher compared to other hk style restaurants by $1-2.5 each, but has larger portions. They have specials for $7.99 and $8.99 before 7pm which are really good deals considering the larger portions. I find their dinner rolls a little crusty if you aren't dipping them in the soup. 

I still strong prefer this old location even with the new and modern one open less than 5mins away.
I find the options and quality much better at the original store. I find many things at the new location bland and the service is much less attentive."}
{"text":"I've came here multiple times, I usually always go to Crazy Wings or The Fry. This place was surprisingly very good. I actually haven't tried many things on their menu other than the breakfast/lunch combo (no different than any other hk brunch places), and their wings&beer combo. Their HK style (original) wings is actually very good, same with salt&pepper. Do not order honey garlic (I personally order honey garlic everywhere, but it tasted almost like BBQ sauce of some sort). But I do recommend their KH/original flavour with the beer combo."}
{"text":"Place is dirty, untidy, and crammed. I usually go to the new Hollywood that's across from the street, but they sent us here once because the new store was full. I was very surprised by how big of a difference the new location is compared to this one. It is definitely a \"classic\", in terms of decor...

Like any other Asian restaurant, you won't expect service here. It is definitely a good place to be loud, have some drinks, and order my favourite - the chicken wing basket special with a drink. It is one of the best deals for a late dinner and sharing (if you're not on a diet). 

Quality of the chicken is definitely consistent and the same compared to the new Hollywood location. Beer does not taste watered down, and their milk tea is decent."}
{"text":"okay..while i may be the highest rated reviewer here..screw you all

i love well priced food!

my taste buds are not exquisite and refined like the yelpers..i do what i can do to fill my belly

anything with sauce is good for me!!!

alright not the most valuable review but i dont care lol i'm just here to review.

milk tea is okay here"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here since I was a little kid. They opened up a new location somewhere, but I prefer this one. 

Reasons:
1. Food is cheaper 
2. Tastier food
3. No long waits

I ordered the Club Sandwich which was about $5 and wow I was blown away from the portion. It came with four sandwiches stuffed with lettuce, bacon, egg, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a side of fries. I also got a hot HK style milk tea! The meal was delicious and I was very full afterwards. Overall, this place is worth and will def bring my friends with me."}
{"text":"a new favorite, all kinds of hk style food at cheap prices. there's a huge selection of drinks and food, and there's tea time specials in the afternoon as well as a 10pm-midnight special. 

when I came I got the French toast & ice cream which was delicious. and got the fried chicken platter which had deep fried wings, legs, fries, onion rings, chicken nuggets, bacon wrapped sausages, fried fish balls served with ketchup and gravy for &14.99. it was DELICIOUS and HUGE. we also got some hk style milk tea and it was pretty great.

definitely coming back to try all the other yummy looking items on their menu."}
{"text":"Wings. 

Happy hour starts at 1pm. 20 wings plus fries and gravy for $16.99

Get them Hong Kong style !"}
{"text":"I took my family here the other day and we had a good time at this spot! Similar in menu to their new location, virtually a stones throw up the road, the prices are really good for what you get. 

Many of the meals come with soup, a small salad, bread rolls and a drink for around $10-15 for dinner. I see they have lots of breakfast and lunch options as well. 

We opted for a few different dishes, the pork chops with black pepper sauce, the short ribs meal and the spaghetti bolognese and of course the wing special. The food was typical hk cafe food, not the best cuts of meat or fanciest dishes but everything was hot and fresh tasting. The spaghetti is actually really good compared to other hk places, they actually put herbs and spices in it and it's delicious at $5.95. 

The wings are the real star; a big heaping pile of wings on top of some fries, and gravy on the side always steal the show. Next time we would order maybe 1-2 dishes to share and the wings as we had way too much food and brought a bunch of it home. The wings are $16.99 on their own or $9.99 with a purchase of a pitcher of any of beverage. We love the cold milk tea mixed with coffee.  

Compared to their other location, there are definitely more options here for dinner but if I just want the wings and spaghetti, I'd rather go to the new location as it's a slightly nicer and newer restaurant. This one is a bit more run down, but still keeping with the Hollywood theme, movie posters and memorabilia covering the wall surfaces. It's a nice family environment.

The service is decent, everything came out quickly and we got extra cutlery/napkins/drinks quickly after we asked. 

Would likely only go back to the other location, unless I wanted something other than the wings, but had there not been a new location, this would be one of my favourite hk cafes!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty extensive afternoon tea menu--their french toast and chicken wings are delicious!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the taste of their food. 

Once again, not the best atmosphere. They are trying to be like a Jack Astor but they are a small asian shop but the food they made was great. I had the spagetti and chicken wings and the spagetti tasted good but the wings tasted amazing. I loved them and I am insanely picky with my wings. 

The prices are very low too. So low, my friend paid for me. :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It's cheap, tasty, and my go to for HK style cafe. Its right next to Market Village/Pmall so parking is always a pain in the bum. 

Food: HK style cafe so western food made by Chinese people. Their menu is pretty extensive though I prefer coming here for high tea. Some of their specials come with soup and drink. Food is good, portions good and price is so cheap! Wings here are also the bomb. 

Service: Fast as lightning; even when it's pretty busy. Didnt have to wait to be seated and food all came within 5-10 minutes. Staff, who are easily distinguished by the huge word \"staff\" on the back (which I find kinda cute because it fits in with their theme), speak cantonese and english. 

Decor: For a Hollywood theme, I find it pretty spot on for as Asian Hollywood at least. Their walls are covered with signatures of famous Chinese people. They also have many TVs with channels fit for everyone in the fam. Plus free wifi. Overall, it's a good place to chill for lang miu/jais. 

Will visit again for sure since pmall is like my second home. Would have gave 5/5 if parking wasn't such a b!tch."}
{"text":"This restaurant/cafe is located just outside of Market Village. They offer a variety of food and all meals. They even have an afternoon tea and evening snack menu offerings. Don't expect to come here and get magnificent service and fine dining, this is a simple HK style cafe. My Mom and I enjoy coming here for quick meals. We enjoyed their afternoon tea the other day, fish ball noodles and fried chicken wings. Simple, quick, tasty. The chicken wings do not come with fries, so if you add it, it will cost you $1.00 more. The noodles were a very good portion and super delicious with the chili oil. Cold drinks are an extra $1, and note that their glasses are smaller than the average expect cold drinks from other cafes. I would definitely return. They also opened the same restaurant literally in the plaza across the street. That location is newer and offers a different drinks menu."}
{"text":"Okay, let me begin to say how awed I was walking in seeing it was jam-packed but I've never really seen anybody waiting outside the doors.  
The menu was pretty impressive as it listed deals after deals with a whole variety of options from chicken wings to seafood casseroles. 

We ordered pretty quickly and the food trickled out as it does one after the other as they're being made.  
Outright, I disliked the food.  The mixed grill was made with cheap 'meats' such as the pork chop was very, very, very chewy with absolutely noooo taste. The gravy itself was horrifying as I'm used to better quality where it's thick and savoury.  The gravy here tasted like dishwater with some gravy powder swirled in.
The same goes for the 'white cream sauce' on the seafood plates - it was very thin and watery; like their cream soups served at the beginning of the meals.  

The only upside was the chicken wings - which were very crisp and juicy.  Their borscht soup was actually delicious as well. 

I think the only reason that made me decide not to return was the attitude of our waitress.  I'm used to \"Asian-Service\" where their only responsibilities are to take your order, bring your food, and then clear up your table - no extra mingling or pleasantries are required.  However, our waitress was the worst.  She was pointing at a sign on the far end of the table and came sooooo close to stabbing me with her finger as she pointed (omg).  Then she forgot my drink and I confirmed with everybody around me that I actually ordered it before I flagged her down and said my drink hasn't come - she became so defensive and told me she would've heard me if I had ordered it ...... (why are you arguing with me in the middle of my meal???).
LASTLY, when she was clearing up - she PITCHED the cutlery onto the plate that was still in front of me as she's on the opposite side of the table.  I understand that you stack everything onto the table: such as tissues, forks, knives, spoons, other plates onto 1 plate as you're clearing up but damn, do not throw shit around in front of my face.  

If you'd like to have better quality food for the same prices and better attitudes - please check out New City Restaurant.  I've been going there for the past decade with my fam and I'll return there for my HK style fix."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often, however, recently everytime I go and order the 17.99 20 piece chicken wings special, I end up with less than 20. Sometimes I'd get 18, and sometimes I'd get 19. Not a big deal except for the fact that it happens EVERY single time so I know it's not an \"accident\". Please be honest if you want frequent customers like me to come back."}
{"text":"Pretty freaking good. My friend recommended this place since he went with some old friends. We went and got the beer and wings deal.

Atmosphere is relaxed and mixed crowd. Families were there along with others. We relaxed for about and hour and a half. Staff was amazing with recommendations. Awesome service. 

The beer was just everyday domestic. We could upgrade the beer, but we were just hungry from being in traffic. But the wings and fries were awesome - amazing seasoning! Great sauces! Recommend the chili pepper wings and ask for extra fries.

Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"While visiting Pmall, we decided to stop by here to give it a try. 

The prices seemed very reasonable, clean atmosphere, and surprisingly fast and friendly service for a chinese restaurant. 

The food was above my expectation. The portions are generous, and very flavourful.
We got Japanese ramen with port cutlet which was very sweet and delicious. 
Also ordered Baked Portuguese chicken over rice which was not bad either. It was a bit too creamy but still good. 
Definitely worth the price. 

I would definitely go back when I'm in the area again, and explore more food items on the menu."}
{"text":"Normally, Hollywood is a pretty nice place to have brunch but today something was wrong.
The food my friend and I had was extremely bland and un flavorful. He got the baked chicken and rice in Portuguese sauce and I got beef brisket noodle soup. 
The beef brisket tasted like rubber bands tossed into a bowl of rice noodles and booked water poured on top.
The chicken tasted un marinated booked chicken with the Portuguese sauce on top. 
I don't know if this is a new thing for them as I have always had good meals here but this was just too bad.
I give it 2 stars just because I hope it's a one time thing."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast, very economy price and food, but avoid their dinner, below average"}
{"text":"4.99 all day breakfast that comes with ham, eggs, milk tea, and a typical noodle dish (like macaroni or vermicelli) and you can choose your meat (like spam, satay beef, etc.). If you feel like the basic is not enough, you can always ask them to add extra soup, noodle, or meat for an extra dollar-ish. For the most part, if you're a typical guy, it's not gonna be enough. Sometimes depending on how hungry i am, it might not be, but for the most part it's enough.

They also have a large number of hk cafe dishes so this pretty much hits the spot even if it's not amazing food."}
{"text":"If you want cheap food in large portions this is the place to go, I guess. I've been here a few times and haven't been particularly impressed with their food or service however. Their grilled chicken ramen was pretty average and also seemed to be made with extremely thick noodles that were more like yakisoba noodles. They also took a ridiculously long time to prepare their desserts (a couple scoops of ice cream and some garnishes shouldn't take more than half an hour...). Considering the price, I suppose you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch.  When my friend and I arrived the place was empty, we sat down and looked at the menu and had a really had time deciding on their huge selection.  I ended up ordering the curry beef brisket with rice and an HK milk tea and my friend order a lunch special that included Portuguese backed chicken on pasta, came with soup and a sweet bun and we ordered a basket of HK style wings to share.  Our food came hot and fast and by this time the place was packed!  The sweet bun was warm and melted in your mouth.  The curried beef brisket was amazing but the Portuguese chicken dish wasn't ready flavoured.   The wings were great and the basket was huge, ended up taking most of it to go.  They charge you a quarter for a to go container which is the first I've ever encounter,  but I is reasonable.  The staff were friendly and quick.  I would come back to tried some of their other dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Hmmmm

At Market Village, serving HK style Western food....

Good cheap place for a cheap eat.... You can get what you pay for.

You will be full when you leave.. but does not make you excited and want to go back.

The food is medicore..service is ok."}
{"text":"Uh can I say how much I enjoy this place? Honestly quick and dirty HK cafe style food for crazy prices. Maybe I'm originally a West-ender, so entering this world of crazy cheap food in the East end is a whole new world for me ;).

This place gets a 4* mainly because of their chicken wing and beer combo... And the fact that I love their specials of the day because of that damn delicious sweet bun and the tomato cabbage soup that is always just so elusive to make at home, no matter how much vinegar, cabbage or even beets you use! (Holy run-on sentence!)

Great place for quick and tasty food; decent portions for decent cost. Only con is cell phone receptions (for Rogers anyways) is le terrible."}
{"text":"This is a great place that I come all the time to for Hong King cafe style eats. You can also grab a drink here too. Excellent family style restaurant with great service and atmosphere.

TIP: there is a wings special that is great value which includes a basket of wings, fries, and a pitcher of beer or whatever drink you want (iced tea, HK milk tea, soft drinks, etc)

TIP2: it's open late for those late nights you're looking for some good eats!"}
{"text":"Rude service. Mediocre food (one of my chicken wings was still slightly raw, but otherwise it was okay). Pretty cheap though."}
{"text":"Food is decent, I've ordered the baked pork chop here before and it was pretty good. The milk tea here is also pretty good. Service is not that great. I had to ask the waitress a couple times to refill tea. Prices are really cheap so makes up for the service.
If you're in the area might as well try it."}
{"text":"Inexplicably waited over half an hour at 1:30pm on a Saturday and it's probably because the food is dirt cheap but you pay for what you get. It's edible but what we ordered was not worth eating. I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese while my boyfriend got the  half steak/ribs with rice. The meat was very firm and of poor quality. The drinks that came with were incredibly watered down. Hands down the worst food we've ever had in a restaurant, he felt sick afterwards and we definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but nothing about this place impresses me at all. The first time I came here, I ordered their wings (honey garlic). The sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle, and although the fries were very good (reminded me of the ones at Costco), the chicken itself was just average. The portion was meant to be shared, but my friends didn't want any, so I ended up bringing the leftovers home. 

The second time I came here was close to Christmas or New Year's. My group and I were informed about a special, but we thought the regular menu was also available during this time. That was not true, and we left because there was nothing on their special menu that appealed to us (plus the prices were very high compared to their regular menu). 

The service here is mediocre, and if I were to return, it'd be for a quick bite. Not a place I would take anyone to."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little joint that used to be located in Market Village. It is known for their quick service and everyday cafe style dishes. I regularly visit this place for their many breakfast options for $4.99. I believe this has changed ever since they moved to their new location. However, what I do love about their late night specials is fried on the spot hickey wings in many varieties of flavours! This place is great for all sort of occasions!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Hk style food.  Good for late night wings and pitcher if beer. Only place I know where you can substitute beer for milk tea or any other drink.    I give it 3.5 out of 5.    Good part is they finally upgraded some of their TVs. Though the contrast turned so bright it hurts your eyes"}
{"text":"City Hollywood Cafe is a HK style cafe. I don't always gravitate towards this restaurant when I'm feeling for cheap eats, because Market Village is such a painful place to find parking sometimes, especially on weekends. 

Overall, I would say that the food here is decent, and the prices are pretty fair. I came here once for afternoon tea (after 2:30 pm) and the deals are pretty good. I found their onions quite satisfying and delicious (although very greasy!)

Recently, I stopped by for dinner with my boyfriend. I ordered a fish fillet sandwich, which came with a side of fries. The fillet was on a burger bun, which I didn't like, but the overall sandwich was tasty. 

My boyfriend ordered black pepper short ribs with a side of fries. The portions were extremely generous and we actually really liked the short ribs. It was tender and juicy, and the fries were awesome with the black pepper sauce. His meal also came with soup and a free drink, which was nice, all for $8.99. 

It's not my favourite HK-style cafe in town, but I definitely wouldn't mind revisiting once in awhile, since I live really close."}
{"text":"I just enjoy indulging in the Hong Kong style breakfast featuring macaroni, toast and eggs. Combos come with a hot beverage also. There's also heavier items on the menu like baked Portuguese rice or spaghetti Bolognese.  The decor doesn't match the menu nor the name well.  There's a statue of an Oscar award outside, multiple TV's playing sports so you'd wonder if this is a sports bar, beer is available and yet the menu is HK style.  Still I'd keep coming here. It doesn't bother me enough to keep me away!"}
