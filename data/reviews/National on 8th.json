{"text":"Worst customer service ever we received. Me and my friends were pretty disappointed. My friend's glass had lipstick stains and when we told our server, instead of apologizing, she claimed its because of dishwasher. We asked for forks and knives and we were giving just one fork and one knife for 5 girls to share. Our server was giving our weird stares. Worst customer service ever! Would never go back again."}
{"text":"Went there to grab some dinner and beer while out holiday shopping. Got there around 6, hostess went to sit us at a table and couldn't find one. We were offered a seat at the bar, which was fine. They have steamwhistle on tap, great beer happy to find it. However went to look at the menu for food, my partner and i both agreed everything seemed over priced and unappealing. We both ordered the pouting and for $12 expected something better than just a side of fried with gravy. We both left dissatisfied. The bartender serving us only asked if we wanted a refill once, she seemed more interested in flirting with one of the other guys there and leaning on the bar than serving any customers."}
{"text":"I don't live in Calgary but must say The National is one of the reasons I will always return. Along with Calgary's eclectic and flourishing independent restaurant scene there is this bustling eruption of craft beer markets and I love exploring all of them. We have been all over Alberta and BC to different breweries. The National has probably the best food and atmosphere of them all,  and I gotta say one thing in particular stands out to me above all the rest; their incredible Caesar. Served in a charming yet decently sized Mason jar rimmed with delicious salts and spices,  they top it up with a bite of IPA and a skewer of mouth watering Sausages,  cheese,  olives and thankfully never forget the traditional celery stick. I can't get enough of them and usually don't even have to order food because of the yummy snack it comes with. However my foodmates did order the fish and chips and they were heavenly as well. The music was a little too loud for normal conversation but this is to be expected in the pub atmosphere in the evenings. Highly recommended -  stop by this (rightfully so!)  growing craft beer chain."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because the rooftop patio is a great time but I don't know if I can go back.  My wife recently had a get together and about 25-30 people showed up (people dropped in and out from 3pm - 9pm).  The service was actually pretty solid so would feel bad for not giving more stars but when the bill came, that's when the shenanigans started.  It was a rather large bill so difficult to get everything sorted.  Several people had paid/tipped before they left earlier in the night while others gave me money to settle up.  My friend and I noticed there were about 6 charges on the bill so asked what they were (can't recall what wording they used on the bill).  The server stated they were tips that were paid by people that had left.  After adding everything up, we noticed that these tips WERE ADDED TO OUR TOTAL.  Not only that, but the 18% auto grat was on top of that.  This means, we were charged for payments already made and had a gratuity added ON those payments. I kid you not.    I'm assuming they are used to big parties getting drunk and just paying whatever.  If so, look at your bills.  This is fraud and someone should really look into this.  After we questioned this, she left and came back with a bill that was $120 less than the original one.  How does this happen?  She ended up taking the old bill and giving me the new one.  Now I wish I had the old one to prove this.  I also now wonder how much was actually taken off the bill from those that previously paid.  Terrible Terrible Terrible.  I will never go back and this place should be ashamed."}
{"text":"We had a great time finishing off our Calgary vacation having happy hour at this bar. It was quiet as expected for a Monday afternoon. Monday special is happy hour pricing all day so it worked out even better for us. It did take us a little bit to actually find this place though. When we got to the corner of the street, we thought we searched up the National Bank by accident instead of the pub. Turns out it's on the third floor of the opposite building.   Happy hour pricing includes Buck-A-Shuck Oysters and draft beer for 25cents/oz=about $5/pint. It's a pretty great deal compared to regular prices.  We both got a flight (6x5oz) of beers along with a dozen oysters and tater tots. They threw in some free popcorn which was so incredibly satisfying. They gave us 6 Kusshi oysters and another 6 East coast oysters. We didn't get the name of the east coast ones, but if you like mild tasting oysters these are for you. Tater tots were solid. Bonus points for actually having them cause these are hard to come by.   We didn't get to check out the patio but it looked like a fun place to go for a easy night out. The waitress was also very helpful. She helped us go through the long list of beers to pick the right ones for us and was good with checking up on us. It was slow enough that she came and chatted with us after about the local breweries. If we had more time we probably would have visited some of them."}
{"text":"So, note to self, trying to find buck a shuck during stampede week is impossible. Any restaurant serving oysters had a special stampede menu...so no buck a shuck and no happy hour beer.  After calling around we found out that this location was still doing buck a shuck but no happy hour on beer. Too bad, so sad on the beer, my sister and I were really wanting oysters so we came here.  Not the best location...the 17th and Westhills locations are much nicer. This National was very dark and very loud. Luckily we found a little booth way in the back that was a little less noisy.  I didn't go up to the patio but my friend who joined us went exploring and said it's really nice up there. Maybe that's the only redeeming quality about this location... Service was pretty slow as well.   Nothing really positive happened that's worth noting. I won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was casual and inviting, service was good, the food menu has bright spots, though the Fried chicken is amped up chicken tenders.  Other foods are good though!"}
{"text":"National on 8th looks to be s fantastic addition to the world of the National Beer Hall!  At the core of any National location you've got 20 oz. pints,  a wildly extensive craft beer list, pretty damn good food and an atmosphere that gets people to be social with large tables for groups and fun games to play.  What more are you looking for? Well, how about an incredible roof top patio 4 stories up along Stephen avenue beyond worth writing home about? Yes? Well it sounds like you had better get your tukas to National 8! See you there!"}
{"text":"All I gotta say is use some spice!  Me and a friend order a fish and chips platter and a veg burger platter and we both tasted the same thing, the lack of flavor.  I hate when I go to a resturant and I can cook better then their cook.  Another place I will never visit again.  Calgary could take a lesson from Winnipeg when it comes to great food."}
{"text":"This National location is pretty consistent to the three others. I visited when they opened during Stampede - really nice to have a big beer garden in downtown Calgary again. They only had canned beer at the time but that's since been resolved.  When I returned a few weeks later, I had made a group reservation for the patio. They made an error on our reservation and had us at the Westhills location, so we were forced to sit inside. It was somewhat disappointing but otherwise a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"I find  that National on 8th has nice decor inside and is definitely an upscale place with a great selection of beers. I say nice because it is not a great selection of beers but if I am wanting a place with an amazing selection of beers I guess I should be going to craft! It is also a very busy and loud place on a Friday night, where you can barely hear yourself think or have a conversation but if you are not expecting this when you are coming then you shouldn't come here. It is quite a younger crowd mainly, and really feels like \"Generation Instagram\". The drinks are decent, and the food is mediocre. I had the popcorn, deep fried pickles and queso dip with chips. Nothing impressive and all overpriced of course. However it is a rooftop that is just cool and pretty at night, and it's pleasant to be outdoors. National also had a both at Beerfest this past weekend!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Way too loud. Very disappointing. Have been to two other locations and love this chain. However, this was the worst ever."}
{"text":"So so ...   Eh. Heard so much about this \"amazing rooftop patio\". The structure is cool. Very unique outdoor experience. However, hard to understand where to go and took forever to get greeted; then, once we were greeted and excited to actually get a drink ... We were told that we couldn't sit at that table.   So, started the whole process again at out new table.   National obviously invested a ton of money into the space; could think about focusing a little more on service.   Hopefully the novelty of the rooftop keeps this one going.   Was so disappointed didn't even bother with food."}
{"text":"My favorite roof top in Calgary without a  doubt.  Although that being said it's clearly the favorite of a lot of folks as it is always packed.  Can't complain though if others have the same great idea about a cool location for drinks after work right?!  Happened to meet up with a bunch of industry colleagues last Friday and had an awesome time which was made even better by our fantastic server (unfortunately I don't know her name).  Several rounds in we decided we needed some food but didn't have a table.  We were kind of hovering around a post that had a high top.  Our awesome server pulled a chair over to pile up the purses and managed to manouver our food, plates etc in with great skill.  She also made some solid recommendations on appies for the group.  We finally managed to snag a table which I will certainly say makes the experience more enjoyable that standing.  Also have to say I love the beerjito...no idea if I'm spelling that right or not but talk about refreshing!  Although do be aware the prices do take a bit of a spike once happy hour is over."}
{"text":"The patio is a great time on a summer night ! Great music and great people. Not five stars only because  the line ups to get in , get to the bar and get into the bathrooms are usually huge!!! This deters us from drinking more but overall fun time !"}
{"text":"National is a great space on 8th Ave, it's a large location so there's lots of seating both inside, on the rooftop patio during the summer months, and in the downstairs bowling alley. An extensive beer lists ensures you'll be able to find something to please your palate and a good list of appies and bar snacks, I'm not sure I have ever ordered a full meal here though. The bowling alley is probably my favourite part of this place, it gets busy so make a reservation, but I always have a good time bowling, drinking and snacking when I come. Pricier than other bowling places for sure but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"National has a great games area but their menu is lacking. They don't have a lot of good choices in my opinion and their main courses are over priced. This place is great for drinks and a group environment but maybe not a dinner party!"}
{"text":"Good food, games area with fussball and table tennis. Waiters are very helpful: we were a group of 8 people and, though it seemed full, they arranged us a nice spot. Later we moved to a semi-private room and they were very cool."}
{"text":"Yes please to ping pong and bean bag toss in the sun!! Beyond the great beer selection at happy hour all beers are five bucks!!  The food is also delicious.   This place is great for friends to get together and have fun.  It is sort of a strange lay out to get to the patio but well worth the little journey!  The prices are a little higher once happy hour ends but worth it.  Service can be pretty slow to be honest.  But the fun of the ping pong set up and the bean bag toss cancel any negative comments about the services.  They make a mean Cesar and hamburger that were made for each other that you should experience.  The interactive lay out of the patio helps with breaking the ice with strangers and all in all this place is great.  Thank you for the rooftop patio!!"}
{"text":"Lunch with the team, burger was average at best but drunks are ok.  LOCAL Pub downstairs beats the buns off this burger for same price"}
{"text":"Been here three times and overall enjoy my visit each time. National is located conveniently on 8th Ave. in the downtown core - but is inside the shopping centre making it a bit harder to find. (upstairs on the 3rd floor). The restaurant has a main level and a patio which was fantastic in the summer. Great beer selection, bar rail as well as a decent pub style food selection at reasonable price. Service was standard and nothing to note.   Would recommend as a joint for post work booze and dinner if you're in the downtown Calgary core."}
{"text":"National is always a safe bet. They are always busy and food, drinks and service is consistent.  Their rooftop patio is unique in all of downtown! During summer you can go there for drinks after work, or even during lunch time."}
{"text":"The rooftop was very nice!!... The service and the drinks were ok.... The food... Well... Is a bar food, don't expect anything gourmet, or extremely delicious, I would say is acceptable... I recommend this place just for a few drinks after work with a group of friends..."}
{"text":"See this is a very confusing review for me to write, cause in the end I had a really good night but I feel like that was because I just really like my friends. The atmosphere is awesome a dance party on a rooftop right downtown, a good selection of beer which includes a lot of local brews (however it is on the pricey side of things. But let's face it their target audience are oil and gassers so they have money to blow), the DJ was fun (a real country music hater but you know it's an acquired taste) and ping pong.. Holler!! Where you lost me was the staff. On two separate occasions we had the waitresses curse us out. One told us to \"pay our fucking bills because no one is getting a tab tonight\" despite not even having our food yet. And the other one charging us for a double and us only getting a single and told us \"it was a fucking double\" it's a total shame that when we tip the money gets split between them all the one good bartender was a total sweetheart and she deserved any tip we did leave. I understand it is probably a high stress job and everybody has bad days but if that's the case maybe you shouldn't be in the service industry. All in all I would be willing to give it a second chance cause it was a fun night but you need to go into it knowing that the staff is dodgy."}
{"text":"Terrible Service.  If you want to check out NATIONAL head to the 10th Avenue or 17th Avenue locations because this one is awful. Myself and 5 other friends headed here for some eats and drinks just before Christmas.  The server was absolutely horrible, never around to grab drink orders, never asked everyone at the table if they needed a drink.  She would simply get grabbed by one of us and only get that person a drink.  At one point in the evening, two other friends joined us quickly at the table for a quick brew before heading out of the restaurant (they'd been at another table previously).  At the end of the night we had to grab the server who was SITTING AT THE BAR CHATTING WITH HER FRIENDS in order to get our bill, we'd had enough at this point.  Then she gave me the bill which was 300$, says \"Wait now, I need to re-do it\".  Comes back with a bill with an auto grat of 18% on it.  I asked why, she said because we'd had 8 people.  So for a small portion of our evening there we had 8 people so we had to auto-tip her 18%?  I had to fucking get her from the bar where she was SITTING.  How can you argue an 18% tip when you're not even serving us at all?  If only she'd been as good getting us drinks as she'd been counting people at the table.  I'm never coming back here, this was an incredibly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Went for buck-a-shuck with the kids...love that I can enjoy the patio and some brews with the kids.  Appies are always good...brussles sprouts and fried pickles.  Prompt service and good value."}
{"text":"Bartender here last night was an asshole!!! Won't be back!! He treated us like second class people because we were not 20-nothings."}
