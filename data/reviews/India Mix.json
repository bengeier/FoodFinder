{"text":"Awesome food and amazing service....i was so satisfied with trying this new restaurant....loved it and would recommend it"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is friendly, but sadly the portions are small. I just ordered take out and the chicken Biriyani had literally has no visible chicken. After searching I have found a couple extremely small flakes. The butter chicken had 5 very small pieces of chicken and the rest is all (tasty) sauce. If you added up all the chicken it might equal half a chicken breast but not even. I also got two gulab jamun and they were great. The place is new and maybe they are still figuring things out so I don't want to write them off just yet. Maybe I got unlucky with my portion size. I hope the owners can read this and hopefully improve because I would love to see them do well. Again, the food is great you just don't get much."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Indian food! Owners really listen and care about making a great experience for us! Butter chicken and palak paneer along with fresh tandoori naan makes me keep coming back! So great and close to home!"}
{"text":"Great family business with great food. Got the butter chicken which was great. Good portion sizes for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Still new and figuring things out. When the food is good, it is really good. The last time we visited, I found a piece of napkin in my butter chicken. It was a fairly large piece that was cooked with the batch. The server replaced it from the same batch and then proceeded to serve more to the next customers. The naan bread is great, but the  vegan naan is not quite hitting the mark. Very nice staff and some really great food, just might need some more experience with food service."}
