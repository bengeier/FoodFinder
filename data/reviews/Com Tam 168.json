{"text":"It was okay but there's definitely better around the area like Kim po. The place is big and spacious and has been around for awoke now. If you perhaps just need a quick pho fix after Pmall then it's passable"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant,  it is not that easy to catch your attention,  but the food was very good and the price was reasonable.  Worth to visit it again and again."}
{"text":"Service is horrendous. I don't even know where to start. 

We had a waitress who brought out our food and spilled it. If that wasn't bad enough, she didn't bring the food to us. I know that's sort of petty, but I have never been to any Vietnamese restaurant  (or any restaurant for that matter) where they did not deliver the food to you. She literally dropped off the food at the table and left. Mind you,  this wasn't a big deal but the restaurant was not busy at all. 

How do I know it wasn't busy? Well, our wonderful waitress was on her phone... at the counter, doing nothing.  

We placed 4 orders and they got out 3 of them fairly quickly. The 4th member of our party did not receive their food after a long period of time. 

When asked about it, the waitress claimed that they \"lost our order\" lol what? Our order was on a piece of paper... I would understand if the waitress had to memorize our order and somehow forgot but that wasn't the case. This waitress clearly did not care about her job 

Better places to eat."}
{"text":"Decently good service. Food is decent.
when i tried asking for separate bills, She couldnt give us separate bills and she charged us extra wayyy extra!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for lunch and had the house special pho. It was delish! The broth was rich. That with the tendon really sticks to your ribs. Definitely want to come back however parking at this mall is usually scarce and hard to find. 

Also the prices are fairly cheap and reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is my go to Vietnamese place in the close Scarborough area.

It's in the Pmall plaza in the same building cluster as TD Bank.

Their pho is amazing, and the rice dishes are great!! My most recent visit though, i ordered some weird curry stir fry which I didn't like too much.

Open till 11pm 7 days a week!"}
{"text":"Viet food with Viet chef and service! Cash only.

Food: 5/5 Good. Ice coffee is always hit or miss.
Service: 4/5 Efficient.
Environment: 4/5 Seating is cold sometimes. 
Washrooms: 4/5 Quite clean.
Worth it?: 4/5 One of the better view places around.

I have been coming here for years. It's always nice to have Viet food made by Viet chefs. It's much closers to Mom's cooking. Not much has changed here but that's a good thing in this case. 

The food is good and portioned well. My go to is always \"Bun\"(noodles) with shrimp on sugarcane and some more meat. I really like getting Vietnamese ice coffee with condensed milk but it's always a hit or a miss. I have had it made really well before and really really poorly as well. I dunno. I like it enough to keep gambling every time. 

Try getting a booth. Some of the tables feel awkward. There seem too close together. 

I highly recommend this place. Will be back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"(2.5*) - Just realised there were so many 168 Pho places I got confused and wrote this review elsewhere.
 
Attention fellow Vietnamese foodies, this place is not owned by Vietnamese people nor do any of them speak Vietnamese lol.

I ordered an off menu item to see if they had it and surprisngly enough because they didn't understand Vietnamese I somehow described it to them and apparently its called the \"Dry\" Mi Thap Camh version if need be ordered in english. 

It was extremely obvious microwaved noodles and on the greasy side, the flavour was pretty good surprisingly, and they offered 2 types of noodles, the thin pho rice noodles and the thin egg noodles. Yay for carbs! 

The beansprouts that came in it was cooked through which I really liked because i utteraly hate raw or semi raw or any bit raw beansprouts.

The crispy shrimp was also on the greasier side but the tiger shrimp prawn was cooked to perfection which made me happy.

No opinion on the amount of pork/beef was okay I've had better.

My friend ordered pho and he said its okay nothing great, he  just ordered for the sake of having noodle soup.

Would I come here again? Not really its convenient if you want viet food at pacific mall but not something I would recommend if you want authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Cash only! Surprised at the quality here. Brother took me here for a late lunch and i got the tomato beef stew noodles. It was delicious - broth was hot & the flavors were so satisfying. Definitely recommend this place for authentic viet food! Plaza within pacific mall."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't even deserve 1 star.  Their customer service is terrible.  I called last to place a take-out order on the phone.  I asked for bbq chicken and beef, the lady said they did not have \"bbq chicken\"...seriously?  I've eaten it numerous time before.  Her English wasn't her strong point so I asked what language she spoke?  She said Vietnamese, so I asked her to hold for a second while I asked my husband to get on the phone and place the order.  After 2 minutes back and forth on the phone, a Cantonese speaking lady came on the phone and my husband passed the phone back to me as he didn't speak it.  I asked the lady for chicken beef rice and another one with the steam egg...she said we don't have steam egg...OMG I was so frustrated I told her forget it.

Tonight, my mom wanted me call them for and get the same two rice orders and she will pick it up on her way home from work.  OMG I thought to myself but fine since my mom wanted it.  Ring ring and the same lady picks up the phone...I asked this time in English \"chicken and beef rice\" and \"chicken and steam egg rice\".  She said they did not have chicken and beef but they have chicken and pork chop....I don't understand what she doesn't understand that I didn't ask for pork chop.  The restaurant serves beef but perhaps not in the combo of chicken and beef but can't you switch it I thought?!?!  She said for $2.50 you can switch pork chop to chicken....

I will never support this restaurant again.  Over and over what a waste of my time."}
{"text":"Good food, but bad service.

This is my go to place for Vietnamese food, but when I went back they hired 3 new waitresses. They were snobby, rude and unfriendly. They would give you death glares when you ask for napkins or anything else, throws your food on the table, gossip and laugh right in front of you about you, and would be on their phones when you need their attention. 

 2 stars for the food, but had the worst time here.
 Time to look for a new place."}
{"text":"Service was bad, foods were just ok.

Attention friends, I had never seen Pho restaurant charge 10% service on bill except buffet restaurants. Just reliazed after we left the restaurant, our bill got charged 10% tips and we paid 10% on top. Make sure to check the bill otherwise pay too much tips that they don't deserve it.

This restaurant doesn't deserve 1 star and i definatly not going back!! Some others Pho places have better food and price."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I really like the food here. The prices in the menu I think is reasonable - same price range of most Vietnamese restaurants and like most Vietamese restaurants it is cash only. 
Why I like coming to thus place is because it has a good menu and it has the Vietamese rice dish that most Vietamese restaurants don't have. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Com Tam is real authentic? Vietnamese food with really good bun bo hue and pho! The bun bo hue has so much flavor and it's so much better than what I've had in Houston, TX. I've had my fair share of Viet food living in Houston. Definitely tastes like a home cooked meal! The service was really great and the portions were  good amount of food. I was stuffed! The pho was really good and the noodles were awesome! Also, they smoothies were made with real fruit. I've tried durian, avocado, and coconut and they were delicious and it's does not taste like it was made from powder. I would definitely recommend this place and come back the next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants to eat Vietnamese food.  I love their Pho, but other noodle soups like Bun Rieu or rice dishes are also really, really good.  It is slightly more expensive than other Vietnamese restaurants, but I don't mind."}
{"text":"What a great hidden pho place! I got the Bun Bo Hue and it was really flavourful. 

The only issue I had with me dish was that there was a significant amount of oil. So much oil that I had to skim off majority of the oil myself. After doing so, it made the dish an amazing experience! 

This is a great Vietnamese spot to try if you are tired of going to your regulars."}

Summary
Altogether the pho had the most delicious broth!  Super fantastic!!! The customer service was okay, the staff don't really talk to you or up sell. The smoothie was SO GOOD sour sop is my fave and they did it correctly. This experience definitely was tasty enough to remind me of my childhood memories going to eat Vietnamese food with my Viet Dad. Ideally I would give this place 3.5 stars for not making my partner and I feel welcomed by the staff, but the staff were nice enough and weren't mean or anything. Seriously great food and worth/would go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Had a \"Bun\" (Vermicelli) here yesterday, with shrimp + sugar cane, grilled sausage, and shredded pork. Also ordered an iced Vietnamese Coffee (with condensed milk).

The food was ok, the portion of the meats looked a little lacking though. The sausage also came as little balls on a skewer which was unexpected. Taste was alright. There were lots of bean sprouts on the bottom, and the regular assortment of other veggies along with the noodles. Lots of crunch.

Iced coffee was strong, but less fragrant than some other places I've had.

Service is friendly."}
{"text":"It's really good vietnamese resraurant. My home is too far, but I always come here. Everything is good. I tried bun rieu, hu tieu my tho, pho hai san chua cay, bun bo hue. Everything is wonderful"}
{"text":"This pho is as good as it gets for my taste buds. I have no idea why there aren't more reviews and better reviews. I used to come to this place back when it was called Peach Garden. It has a new name but the food is still the same old goodness. The beef broth is so tasty. I also love their spicy sweet and sour seafood pho--similar to tom yum. Their fried spring rolls are soooooo good. Not to miss. I also had their broken rice dishes and they were also delicious with grilled meats, fried shrimp tofu skin sides, steamed egg, shredded pork. It's a huge dish. 

I can't wait to go back for more the next time I visit Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad and my bun noodles were quite tasty as were the fresh rolls.  However, the others in my party complained of a \"stale chicken fat\" odour in their dishes.  Their menu is quite lengthy.  Like many Vietnamese restaurants, ambience is virtually nil.

I am giving it two stars due to the extreme rudeness of the servers, who acted like they were doing us a big favour by waiting on us.  Sorry, ladies, this is not the way to treat customers.  I left you a tip in hopes you were just at the end of a hard day, but I can't leave a good review."}
{"text":"We visit often because the food is good.

The biggest turn off is when the waitress chases after kids for tips! Tips are optional, why do you expect them to tip? Especially when they are only 15-17 years old? We have witnesses this three times. It's awkward and embarrassing for both parties. The worst part is after the kids tip them, they go back and complain after! \"They almost left! Can't believe they didn't tip!\" 

So if you dont plan to leave a tip, you better run after you pay lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the most amazing Vietnamese restaurants I've eaten at. The bun bo hue is amazing and the pho ga is extremely flavorful. 

Houston, Texas is known for it's amazing Vietnamese restaurants and the pho here is above them. I am from Texas and have had my fair share of Vietnamese dishes from Houston and trust me, Com Tam is way above. 

I highly recommend eating here because the food is amazing"}
{"text":"One word: dirty 

When we got there we were quickly greeted and guided towards a booth that was covered with old bean sprouts both on the seat and on the floor.  We got our menus and tea.  My first tea cup had someones leftover noodle stuck on the outside.  I politely ask for another one.  The second one i got had someones leftover noodle stuck on the inside.  I turn it toward the server and asked him if he was serious.  For his third attempt he proceeded to bring two cups for me to choose.  So i proceeded to tell him to choose and for him to tell me which one he thinks is clean.  Im not a picky person.  I just want to eat out of clean vessels.  The food was okay, but after getting dosed twice with dirty cups, i kept questioning if the bowl i was eating out of was completely clean or if it had someones leftover noodle in it and chef just decided to put my food in anyway.  Made me gag.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I actually never knew there was a Pho restaurant here until last week when my dad passed by here and notified me about it. I usually stick with Kim Po because I love the noodles there, but I decided to give this place a try just to see how things compare between the two restaurants.

I tried the seafood egg and rice noodle soup, however I originally only wanted rice noodles in my soup (not a fan of egg noodle soup in general). Unfortunately both noodles were added in the bowl. Seeing how the restaurant was insanely busy and I knew beforehand to not expect good service, I decided to just stick with it. At the end, the bowl was decent, but nothing to write home about.

Throughout the time I stayed in the restaurant, there was a male customer who kept talking to himself, and outlined everything that was tasty in the restaurant...to himself, then proceeded to try and start a conversation with anyone in the restaurant. When he got his food, he ate it for about 3 minutes, then went outside for a good 30 minutes before returning. Not sure what his intentions were, but I definitely felt a little uncomfortable eating.

I honestly don't see myself returning here; Kim Po provides better food IMO."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! It's not the BEST, but it's alright.

This time we had the:

-House special pho (Large): HUGE bowl of noodles. But a disappointing amount of meat. There was about 2 pieces of each type of meat, for a large size I expect a bit more. Soup was flavourful and hot enough. Yumm!

-Spring roll, bean curd shrimp, and grilled pork  vermicelli: Again.. HUGE bowl of noodles. This one had a very good amount of toppings! Everything was fresh (even the lettuce and bean sprouts at the bottom) and in good portion. All of the toppings were pretty good, especially the bean curd shrimp.

Service is quick. Tables could use a bit more thorough cleaning. 

This place is my go-to place for viet food. It's in a super convenient location, open late, and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"A cozy place to eat with family but avoid sitting near the counter because the servers talk way too loud. The three female servers that were working that evening laughed and giggled among themselves the entire time, it was annoying. Other than that, the noodle soups were yummy"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5*

I have been here multiple times usually during the weekdays for lunch so there are plenty of seats. Parking, on the other hand, can be difficult if you want to park close to the restaurant. Since this restaurant is located in the vicinity of Pacific Mall, there are loads of parking; but you might just need to walk a little further at busier times or on the weekends. 

The service is pretty good - they greet you and will ask you the number of people in your party as you walk in and then they will just direct you to an empty table just like any Vietnamese restaurants. The food comes very quickly after you order so it is definitely great for a quick delicious lunch. 

The menu is quite extensive, but I always get the same thing every time - PH05 - Pho with Flank beef and meatballs ($8.50 for a small). I find it quite expensive since the portion is on the smaller side. I usually can't finish my bowl of pho in other restaurants, but this one I could finish without any problems. There are 2 types of noodles that you can choose from, fresh or dry, and the waiters will ask you. I always choose the fresh ones because why eat dry when you can eat fresh. However, I do want to compare the difference in the future. 

I love that the pho broth always comes super hot! This restaurant probably has the hottest broth in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants. I hate eating my noodles in warm broth. It should warm your soul when you eat it. As mentioned earlier, there isn't enough noodles in the portion. There's definitely a lot more in the medium size. Come to think of it, the medium is worth the price ($9.5) since the portion size is a lot bigger. However, I can never finish it. The beef slices and the meatballs are just like any other pho restaurants. The main thing I like about the pho here is that the broth isn't filled with MSG. I like how the broth here is still flavourful without the heavy MSG. 

Unfortunately, they only accept cash or debit here. It is also very ghetto how they can't do separate bills. Instead, they will write out all the different prices on their one dinky bill. It makes getting change SO much harder. 

I will definitely try the other dishes if I come back next time - perhaps the curry noodle soup or even their Dry Rice Vermicellis - Buns."}
{"text":"Since grand opening until now they have kept their quality consistent. This is where I go to satisfy my pho craving. It isn't the best pho out there but isn't terrible either. The staff are always super nice and seating is comfortable. The have a very clean environment and the broth isn't super heavy on the MSG. 

Not a huge fan of their rice or spring rolls, I find them super mediocre. I like how they have an option of fresh or dry noodles. The fresh noodles is what keeps me coming back. 

If anyone decides to come just know that they take cash only !"}
{"text":"Com Tam gets the full 5 because it is hands down the only restaurant that serves a legit pho bowl in the Scarbs and Markham area. 

The waitress seated us, took our order sheet, and was back within 5 minutes with the food.

The pho was sooo good.  This is one of the restaurants where their soup actually tastes like pho and not warm water with salt in it.  Even after I added the bean sprouts it still tasted like soup (this is an actual legitimate concern in other restaurants).

Their prices are competitive as well and the bowl is packed. I could not finish a medium and would've been happy with a small. 

There is absolutely 0 interactions between the staff and you but they do handle everything efficiently when the restaurant isn't jam-packed; that being said if they were full it would be chaotic as there's usually only 1 or 2 waitresses at all times.

*It's a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Such baaaad service. How disappointing.
8/10 when I come I honestly have no clue what the waiter/waitress is saying and they're pretty rude too. Occasionally they would drop/break/spill stuff. 

Luckily the food is pretty good here so it makes up for the bad service. This is the only place I found in the Scarborough/Markham area that serves broken rice!! The short ribs with broken rice dish is the beeest! Their pho is also pretty decent, but not the best. Another good dish is the grilled pork and spring roll with vermicelli. Portions are really big and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Very good cheap vietnamese food. Parking is really easy since it's near pacific mall. I love their fruit shakes. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and pho enthusiast"}
{"text":"I barely noticed Com Tam 168 changed their name since the old school Peach Garden...

Service is extremely poor, as expected from 90% of Asian restaurants. I asked them for something while they walked past me and they didn't even bother to flinch. The servers there don't speak English which could be quite frustrating.

The food itself is really good - it's one of the few places in Scarborough that actually gives you an option whether you want fresh or dry noodles in your pho. The soup itself is full of MSG (which some people may perceive as bad but it just means more delicious!.. just drink more water to compensate)..

They have many traditional Vietnamese toppings such as their speciality meat balls and shredded pork skin. Many chinese-owned vietnamese restaurants will not have those options."}
{"text":"Com Tam 168 serves the worst Banh Cuon Vietnamese Steamed Rice Roll ($6) I ever had in GTA... don't even bother or think about ordering. It is cold, hard and tasteless. Might as well take it off the menu.

The Pho ($7) was not bad and have a choice of fresh or dried noodle but the broth was quite one dimension and really on the sweet side. The soup was not hot enough so my raw beef stayed really raw.

I don't think I would be back. 

Cash ONLY"}
{"text":"I frequent the downtown location by gerrard square.  This one by pacific mall is a first.  Same menu.. on the slightly pricier side for rice.  about 9.50 for 2 items and rice.  (it does come with the wonton soup)

the service is horrendous.. you will have to seat yourself.. and dont expect tea to come either.. i had to wave them down for everything .. they acknowledge you but will pretend they dont see you unless you actually call for them.

i ordered quail at this location and it was small, dry and overfried... the one by Gerrard square were noticeably bigger and definitely had more meat.

I do like the fact that they use broken rice vs. normal rice.  Serving size is average... 

they also have sour soup combo which i will have to come try in the future."}
{"text":"Yo for real I've been looking for a pho place and I think I've found one of the better ones. Oftentimes in Markham/East GTA its Chinese people running the show, which makes it not as good and I can tell if it ain't real. 

I grew up in Hamilton and that's where the real deal is. Pho Dau Bo was bae and Com Tam 168 has actually been the closest at replicating that flavour and experience. This will now be my new go to pho place until I find a better one. 

That being said, I agree that they lack in a few places as they're missing the key ingredients in the Pho Dac Biet such as the tripe. I also realized the prices are now higher, but I'm assuming that other places are now at the same level due to inflation. I got a large, which was quite big and filled me up. 10.50 + tax. Not bad not bad. 

Service was ok. Not the best but gets the job done. 

3.5/5. Good pho. Will come back."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty nasty and other types of dishes were below par. The broth has so much oil in it. You can see bubbles foaming on top. So much oil you can't even pick up noodles with the chopsticks."}
