{"text":"Got the chicken cutlet wanted curry sauce nope I got a salty thick gravy .... Cutlet was so over cook the meat looked plastic. Threw it away after 3 bites. Waste of money & time"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Their bbq short ribs are amazing, and you get to choose the sides. I love hawaiian food and I will definitely be a regular at this place from now on."}
{"text":"yay!!!!
Very similar to Ohana except closer to us! Yummy bbq chicken!!! And yum yum mac salad! Been 2x!! :)"}
{"text":"Food as always is delicious the place was busy busy and short staffed but they were doing a good job.  Warning its worse that dinning inside a McDonald's play pin. So many screaming kids."}
{"text":"The service here has gone down hill since they opened.  Today I ordered the mahi mahi sandwich meal. I went to put the sauce on the bun and there was only enough fish to cover half the bun. Really? I sent the cashier person back to get another piece. I shouldn't have to check to make sure there is a complete sandwich. Very disappointed.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food at this location is pretty good. I ordered the beef bowl with a spam masubi on the side. The beef was very tasty and the spam masubi was nothing special. The cashier seemed like he didn't want to be at work and had little to no facial expressions. Maybe he was tired, but this wasn't the first time I've seen him like that. Other than that the food is ok and location is great."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's way better than the chains in Cali. I love their BBQ sauce and their curry chicken katsu is yummy. And I love their mac salad. The mini portions are not really mini, at least for me. It's a fairly big portion size. I will make the short trek out here when I get the craving for Hawaiian BBQ. The others aren't as awesome as this place :)"}
{"text":"This locations is the bomb! All other locations should base their business model off of this one. Staff is always friendly, food is always hot, fresh and delicious.  I have become a regular and they now have my modified order down and offer me my \"usual\" when I walk in. 

I'll be moving farther away from this location soon, but I will definitely be making the trip to get the spicy chicken, extra spicy, no skin with brown rice on the regular!!"}
{"text":"This is a good L&L. It's very clean and the people are nice. The food is always good and it's cheap. The mac salad is bomb here I always get an extra with my Bbq mix plate. Musibi are fresh and they have a bunch of specials. We always come here and it's always a good experience."}
{"text":"I have never ate Hawaiian Bbq before and my boyfriend took me to L&L because he works right across the street. And I am now a fan of the food, they have great food with great prices. You get more than you pay for!! I am most definitely going to be going back and eating there. I especially love the macaroni salad and spring rolls they make."}
{"text":"I honestly wish I could just give no stars... Customer service is horrible. Ran by these Chinese guys who don't know how to cook any Hawaiian food at all, barely know any English, and have the worst attitudes. Ordered garlic chicken and they gave me Chicken from a fast food Chinese place. THIS IS NOT HOW GARLIC CHICKEN IS MADE FROM ANY OTHER L&L OR EVEN A SINGLE HAWAIIAN PLACE AT ALL!! the chicken was undercooked, not even crispy. Pretty much close to raw. Flavorless 

Anyways. I was trying to be nice. Tasted the food, tasted like pure garbage. I literally had a small bite of a piece of chicken and it almost made me wanna spit it out right away. Finally. Asked the workers to give me a refund and HAD TO GO THROUGH AN ARGUMENT JUST TO GET 5 or 6 dollars back. He gave me the nastiest face And guess what? To top that off, the guy threw the money at me. Complete garbage food and garbage employees who work there. Would wish this place gets closed down so no one else has to suffer."}
{"text":"Use to like coming here to get my favorite L & L Hawaiian BBQ meal. But my recent orders has been skimpy n overcooked. Some of the meats r burn beyond recognition n the area start to look like a homeless paradise. Most shops used to be here has shut its doors!"}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I stopped in on a whim, enticed by the appealing exterior of the restaurant: who wouldn't love a 50's looking diner that served Hawaiian BBQ? 
As soon as we walked in, we realised that the 50's diner had gone bust a while ago, and L&L had just moved in.  A large section of seating is roped off and vacant, and the walls are covered in posters for various dishes, which makes it look cheap and gross inside.  But the staff was very friendly! We ordered a spam sushi roll-thingy, which was surprisingly delicious, and then each had Kalua pork entrees. The food was fresh, tasty, and made to order.  The only downside was that everything is served in styrofoam, and then you're handed plastic forks and knives.  It's tragic that the restaurant is a better steward of the environment!
Overall, if the restaurant was tastefully decorated (for crying out loud, get some cool Hawaiian stuff tacked up instead of these posters!), and more importantly, if the food was served in a more sustainable manner, we'd have given this place a higher rating.  Unfortunately, because of the styrofoam we won't be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"Honestly... when I am in Hawaii or even when I lived there... I never ate at L&L. Maybe once in a blue moon.. but never regularly.

Since moving up to Las Vegas, I did find myself eating here more often than not. I like the fact that they have lau lau and kalua pig as a regular menu item where Island Sushi has it only as a special.. but that is pretty much all I ever get when I visit L&L. In Hawaii, I'd get their beef stew or curry, but I can easily make that myself now.. whereas lau lau is a little harder.

I like that fact that you can choose to have cabbage or no cabbage with you kalua pig. Depending on I feel, I will order one or the other. Their other menu items like their mahi mahi is okay.. nothing special. I once felt like getting breakfast for dinner -- Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice.. but I could have easily made that at home for waaaay cheaper!

The location is convenient. But since finding out about Island Sushi, I have been choosing them over L&L as of late. If an Aloha Kitchen was closer, I'd go there as well over L&L. 

I guess because I'm so used to crappy L&L in Hawaii, that I find it is overrated."}
{"text":"I went in this evening, ordered shrimp and short rib. There were 4 shrimp and 3 short ribs over rice and cabbage. The shrimps were dry and short ribs were over cook. The rice cooked well but tasted horrible because they use cheap rice. I paid almost $12, I wouldn't go back. I can get something better for what I paid."}
{"text":"Food is not bad.  I think there are better places.  I think it's the look of employees faces that is discouraging.  They look sad and have a blank stare when taking your order.  I prefer a more friendly worker environment."}
{"text":"Very cute Hawaiian decor. Makes it feel a lot like home with the music. The girl who took my order was sweet and helpful. I work right down the street, so I'll be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come to this location... They care more about closing then customer service. Didn't even get a chance to even try the food.. I'll try a different location next time"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing Hawaiian  style fried chicken dish which is covered in panko crumbs. The staff is friendly and i love the side dishes.

They also have tasty sides as well healthy alternatives  like  rice bowls and grilled chicken. I def like the options.

I would def only consider this place when it comes to Hawaiian  food."}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews. This is disgusting. Ordered the Katsu Saimin. The Katsu was hard, over fried, over breaded, and had hardly any actual chicken. It was mostly breading. The Saimin had no flavor. Just noodles and a Weak broth. I feel like I could've made a pack of ramen noodles and it would've been better than this. Not to mention the signs that say that you can only get one refill and that you can ONLY get rice and Mac win combo meals. I should have taken that as an omen that this place is not somewhere I want to be. Never again. Do yourself a favor and go to Aloha Kitchen. This L&L is gross."}
{"text":"Food was Okay.. most of the chicken in my bowl was just pieces of fat. And the waitress was dressed poorly. She looked like she would pull a gun out ofln us at any minute. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Good all place to grab a quick bite, I love the fact they serve Pepsi and they seemed to have some canned beverages that you might not find elsewhere. The chicken sandwich was nice, fresh crisp lettuce, hot flavorfull chicken I think it could used a bit more sauce or tomato. Te short ribs were good also but could have used more sauce. I had the noodles with the BBQ chicken I suggest adding some of the house teriyaki sauce to the noodles and broth to get more of a ramen flavor. All in all it was very good and reasonably priced. We plan on returning soon"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is a great change from the usual fast food out here in Vegas. I haven't a clue if its authentic or what but I tell you this its pretty good. The portions are pretty filling too. I usually get the Chicken Katsu."}
{"text":"6/28 around 1:30 pm 
I called to place an order the lady on the phone was rude and being difficult hung up on me 2 times the second time after I placed my order I called back to ask the price and how long it was going to take and she said \"sorry we can not do your order anymore \" I said wow is there anyone else I can talk to she Hung up on me"}
{"text":"Always very friendly. Place is clean as well. I usually get chicken katsu, BBQ chicken or laulau. I don't recommend the mahi.
They also have good banana lumpia that doesn't have a sugar glaze on the outside. $1.75 for 2."}
{"text":"Majority of the staff is friendly and nice. I usually order the Kalua Pig and lau lau combo as its one of favorite food. I would definitely be back to this locations. 
The guy cashier saw me walk in and just turned his back against me and started talking to the chef. They talked for a while while I just stood there then he finally turned around with an un welcoming facial expression. 
This location changed over time and I can't find 1 good tasting item on the menu anymore keeping in mind I eat at L&L a lot and ordered majority of the items on the menu. 
I would recommend a different locations"}
{"text":"This was a very good lunch. I really enjoyed the pork and luckily I like cabbage because it had more cabbage than meat. The picture on the menu is a little misleading."}
{"text":"I love the food. Great hospitality, cool little dinner. Can turn this skinny Korean into a fat Hawaiian."}
{"text":"Mixed plate was good to go.  I stopped in for a light lunch while visiting the area and what I ordered was perfect.  I got the mini size mixed plate and it was just the right size for one person not wanting to be so full after lunch they want to take a nap!  White rice, chicken, beef and pork...and a side of macaroni.  All good.  Simple little place (which I like) and the guy who took my order was super nice.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I always get the low-carb bowl, which is healthy and massive. It's the perfect post-workout food. The staff are friendly, the price is right, and it's impossible to only eat a little. Oh, and the fact that it's all freshly-cooked makes it all the better."}
{"text":"This place just sucks, from the cashier that looks miserable to the bland tasteless food. Came in and ordered the bbq chicken and it was meh on the slightly salty side. We also had the fried shrimp, they were hard as a rock and had no flavor. I'll avoid this place from now on."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  I cannot say that I would order the Spam, since that would probably give me flashbacks of my childhood.  I order the meals without the macaroni salad.  Being Asian, I do prefer having my white rice.  It may take a little long sometimes for the food to be served, but you know it didn't not sit under a heat lamp.  I suggest trying different dishes if you do not like a particular dish.  The combo meals will give you different choices and then you can pick you favorites from there.  I would frequent this place more if I lived closer."}
{"text":"This is close to my home. The food is good, the customer service is good, your food comes out fast. The only gripe I have is the restroom. When you enter the area you automatically smell sewage and sometimes it happens depending on the area and thats fine. When you enter the restroom, however the drain is full of guck. You will lose your appetite if you go in the restroom before you eat."}
{"text":"Second time at this location . Once again did not disappoint . Had the half & half platter, again too much food to eat, value of food for the price is exceptional. Had my first musabi tonite. If you get two of them it would be enough for a meal by themselves .definately recommend this location."}
{"text":"The grilled Maui & Maui is amazing 
I eat here 2x a week 
Prices are good food is fresh 
Close to everything 
Try it out 
I wished they served coke

{"text":"I am a frequent customer and have been for years. I went in one summer day to fulfill my cravings for their famous BBQ chicken with rice to go. Daniel (Danny), who did the order taking, did not offer me a greeting and had a monotone voice. Not even a smile was shown. It was like talking to a robot. He clearly did not feel like being there at all. When my order was ready, my food wasn't sealed properly and was slid from the register area to the end of the counter where I was at. He didn't even offer me a thank you or farewell. I just left right away because I was starving. It wasn't busy at all, only one other customer there.

When I reached home, I opened my to go box and found out there was no rice at all, just the mac salad along with my chicken. I was so disappointed. I went back to l&l to get my order fixed. As no surprise, I received no greeting from Daniel again. I told him about my rice that was supposed to come with my meal. He gave me a \"sigh\" right in front of my face and turned around and scooped rice and placed it in my to go box. No apology was given when he returned the box. Just quickly turned around and went about his business. When I returned home, I opened my box and found a 1/2 scooped rice in my box. Not even a full scoop was given to me after I drove all the way back there. 

It is quite clear Daniel (Danny) isn't paying close attention. Not only is he rude, he is an example who will drive l&l customers away from the restaurant. He ruined my whole experience and I will never come back there. I encourage all l&l customers to stay away from that establishment. I would give this place \"Zero\" stars if I could because of Daniel.

The company should FIRE Daniel. He is not a good example of an L&L employee. The total opposite actually."}
{"text":"The bbq meat is where it's at and they have a pretty big menu, but the hamburgers were stark in contrast to how amazing the other plates are.
You never have to wait long for your order which is pretty rockin' for bbq(some what fast food), and the price isn't that bad either. My suggestion get a fancy soda in a can, and avoid the plain boring soft drinks from the fountain."}
{"text":"Closed for repairs................does not indicate the length of closure.  That's all I have to say and yelp wants me to say more...what else is there to say.  When they are open staff seems nice.  Convenient because it's close to my house.  Better serve than Island Sushi??  Anything else u want me to write yelp?"}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for 15 years and I can't tell you how much at home I feel when I go in this restaurant.  The food is the bomb and my haole boyfriend is hooked on the loco moco...I love there katsu and everytime I go in there they have a new item ..LOVE IT!!! MAHALO for bringing a little of home into my life =)"}
{"text":"it was a pretty good experience for my first time of Hawaiian food. the waiter is friendly and food is all good, I don't really like the American BBQ but this kind of Hawaiian BBQ is good for me, they got rice and cabbage it is kind more heath than American BBQ, and they also can change the Mac salad to toss Green salad, and I like how that goes. for me, i'm a Chinese and I think the waiter serves good. I like it, cause is actually my first time so I don't know what is the average of this. for me they serve good, so I think 4 star may be a regular evaluate."}
{"text":"Been going to L&L since the late 80's.  This was a good one.  Malasadas are not like leonard's but will hold you over.  They even have the ramen burger.  Clean store.  Decent food when craving hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at L & L's in Hawaii, Las Vegas, and both Phoenix locations.  This location is a bit better than the Happy Valley location (and I live closer to the Happy Valley location!).  My most recent trip to this location was on 2011-05-29.  The staff here are more friendly, very customer-focused, and make you feel like you're a brah'.  The food is authentic - short ribs, chicken, katsu, saimin, spam musube, etc.... it is a taste of hawaii in the desert.  
You walk up to the counter and place your order, then grab a table.  Admire the prototypical wall pictures of hawaiian sunsets, beaches, and dancers... t-shirts on the wall... piped music....  then your order gets called...

Somehow, it just isn't the same as eating it in Hawaii.  The flavors are there, but you miss the beach sand, the moist ocean breezes, and surf... 
but if you close your eyes and dream as you take bites of the delicious food... for just a sec or two, you'll remember.... and smile...."}
{"text":"I can't stand the guy at the register at all. The one with the Bieber hair. He never smile whenever I come in and always look so mad. Sometimes I don't even get a thank you or anything and I was being charged extra .25 cents bc of the soy sauce which I asked for is the bbq sauce. Keep in mind I was a regular never had a problem with gabby but this Asian guy"}
{"text":"This was the worst teriyaki beef... I bought it for my lunch at work... it was half fat and gristle...couldn't eat it... what a waste of money"}
{"text":"Disappointing,  this used to be my favorite Hawaiian BBQ but lately It seems in attempt to save money they use thinner meat and after its breaded and fried it taste like dry cardboard plus they raised their prices.
The one on Stephanie is slightly better."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, we only go here for the food. It's a bit expensive and the customer service has a lot to be desired. The food is delicious, but they will definitely nickel and dime you. We were ordering for my father in law, and he decided he wanted an extra Katsu sauce. Typically it is a .25 charge, which is definitely not a lot, but when we already waited 20 min for our food, I think it's a bit ridiculous to ring that up. I know they have a business to run, but show a little appreciation for the $$ we just dropped and the time we waited for an establishment that is supposed to provide food in a minimal amount of time. We'll just remember to have an extra quarter in our pocket in case anyone has last minute requests, so our card doesn't have to be charged again."}
{"text":"Great fast food better than other places like mcdonalds. Great portions"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place again hoping the lady had a bad day prior. Guess what same RUDE service as the last time! Plus it's so hot in here with no air conditioning! Worth driving up to the W. Charleston location. No wonder we were the only ones there!!"}
{"text":"I love L & L BBQ, but not this location! The staff,management are awful. The guy actually followed me out of the place running and yelling. I simply asked that my macaroni salad be put into a separate container so it wouldn't get hot, they said NO that is how we serve it. I told them two more times. They did it but not without yelling. I was so surprised, the people that were dining in there all turned to look at them yelling. They too couldn't believe this. I was wondering how far this guy was going to go. I got my cell phone ready to call the police. He went back into the restaurant at that point. 
I called them when I got home and threatened to report them to the police for harassment and scaring my daughter in the car-the lady then said I am sorry I am going to refund your meal. What the hell was that!?
Never will return. Which sucks because I preferred that location. Sad."}
{"text":"The place is clean, the staff are nice. I like the BBQ mix plate and chicken Katsu there MUST TRY IT. And also they have a lot of specials."}
{"text":"Love the food always have but the attitude this girl has Diana needs to change, I asked if they still had bowls and you know what she said to me! She said \"yea no shit we do\" and rolled her eye's at me. Even the mext guest she took care of said she should smile more and she gave him attitude also. So if you come and she is here short young girl, will probably be on her phone, be prepared for some attitude.  MANAGEMENT PLEASE RETRAIN HER OR FIRE HER, she is definitely ruining the l&l brand."}
{"text":"I normally eat at the L&L Hawaiian down next to Costco on Charleston Boulevard. I decided to try this one and it was as good as the other one. I love their Korean barbecue beef it's delicious it's not that fatty. They give you large portions you can actually share it with someone. They're their grilled or sauteed fish was delicious also my friend had that one. I'll definitely come back I always enjoy good ol Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Good Hawaii barbecue. I no frills. Small dining area,. To go friendly,"}
{"text":"I don't eat the food here, but my munchin loves it."}
{"text":"Food quality is so-so...meaning to say at least it's edible. Prices are decent and its the only Hawaiian food place that is closest to my house. So if you live in summerlin and have a sudden craving for loco moco, this should be enough to hold you over till your not too lazy to drive farther."}
{"text":"Food tastes and looks so unappetizing. Will not be returning. The atmosphere is bland and the workers I dealt with were not friendly :("}
{"text":"Great food and service! My favorites are anything grilled (short ribs, chicken, beef) and chicken katsu. 
Tip: call ahead and order. It takes a little while to get your food because it's cook to order. 

YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been eating from here for about a year but the bbq beef is exceptional, the Loco Moco dish is flavorful and whoever came up with the concept of gravy fries is genius. Five stars all around."}
{"text":"Always great food at a great price!  My girls like the Katzu chicken and I'm addicted to the Katzu chicken with curry. Their Kalua pork is also sure to please. A great alternative to burgers or tacos.  What more could you ask for?  Great food at a fair price and a very friendly staff make this a 5 star place for us."}
{"text":"Great place for a very reasonable priced lunch. Portions are very good, you should not leave here hungry. Got the regular kuala pork with cabbage. Enjoy"}
{"text":"More fat than meat.  Had spicy chicken & beef combo.  Flavor was good, but quality of meat was as bad as it gets.  I asked for recommendation when I ordered, I can't imagine anything worse.  I will need to go someplace else to eat, only 25% of the meat was edible.  Other reviews must have been written by owners or workers there.  Unable to recommend this to anyone but the family dog."}
{"text":"Not my fave place for Hawaiian food/ Asian foods. It's ok. Large enough portions and the flavors are ok. I feel like this food is really heavy and it feels like a brick in my stomach."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, the shrimp was dirty. I had dirty deep fried shrim and when I asked for a refund they refused because I ate the rice. And said I could have something else beef or chicken. I told them I don't eat anything else. The manager refused to give me a refund and refused to give me contact information for the store owner. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I like this place. But it isn't always consistent. Sometimes the ramen soup base is more flavorful and other times it's more bland.  The spam musubis rice is pretty mushy. It fills in the cravings though."}
{"text":"The woman was friendly so I give this place two stars. But the food, it wasn't all that great and over cooked. I ordered chicken katsu and I felt like the pieces I got were the breading and the skin more than meat. It was SUPER crunchy(not in a good way) and just DRY. They literally give you two small scoops of rice. I got a medium drink and was told ONLY one refill. I mean come on now what place has a limit of ONE refill for fountain drinks. If the food wasn't so dry and actually tasted better I wouldn't have mind so much. The katsu sauce tasted funny and seemed as if they mixed it with something else and the same with the teriyaki sauce. Overall, the food wasn't worth it and this place just seemed cheap in everything...food, refills and sauce. I'm Polynesian, I know what good polynesian food taste like and this is a water down version."}
{"text":"Great local Hawaiian food, good local Hawaiian music, convenient location with that retro 50's diner look... All in all, a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to L & L.  I've been  quite a few times other locations before but never to this one. I found the location clean very nicely decorated I enjoyed the Hawaiian decor. The location is clean and quant. The cashier as well as my server with Ryan he was quite courteous and extremely helpful he was attentive to our needs and was quick to reply with anything that we  requested he's a wonderful asset to this location.
     I wish I had as high praises of the food as I did the service. Unfortunately that's not the case. I ordered the katsu chicken which was seriously overcooked.  I would recommend that you let them know you want your chicken cooked softly so that you don't end up with overly crispy chicken. Only about 3/4 of mine was editable."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ short ribs and they were overlooked - dry and semi burnt. The quality of the food has deteriorated throughout the years and I've visited this location several times this year and all have been disappointing. Food often overlooked, rice tasted old, and macaroni salad always runny with overkill of mayo."}
{"text":"Very descent Hawaiian food.  The service is okay but they could be a little more personable but overall good experience.  It's definitely a cross between Chinese and BBQ."}
{"text":"I usually like the other location.  This one's near my house.  I brought my empty cup from the other location.  They couldn't refill here.  I work in the food business and we refill almost 98% of every guests cup.  It's just basic guest satisfaction. I don't care where the cup came from.  Overall food is good."}
{"text":"I have been to this L & L several times over the past months. This place is like heaven for anyone who is on a low carb diet. I usually get the Super Low Carb Plate that comes with a variety of meats as well as eggs, prepared the style of your choice. It's right around $12 and is enough food to last me two generously portioned meals.

The rest of the family typically goes for the BBQ Chicken platter. Also generously portioned as well as delicious. 

Only downside is that it is near impossible to call ahead. The line is always busy. 

Regardless, this place is five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Great food, VERY unfriendly service. The cashier was extremely rude. Chubby guy without the ability to smile or say thank you. I asked for a courtesy cup for my 3 yr old so she could have some ice and Juice while we waited for our to go order.  I filled it with ice 1 part hive and 1 part water and this guy some turned off the fountain machine and made me give him the cup back!!!!!!!!!!!  Mind you this is a small cup filled half water and Half juice for a small child to drink. Is Business that bad over there??? That's extremely cheap I won't be returning and sadly it's not due to the food.All the Hawaiian places in town have a reputation of being extremely friendly and welcoming, not here. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food, love the malasadas rolled in tons of sugar!!!! Chicken katsu is great.!"}
{"text":"I just ordered the Fried Saimin and it was really, really bad.  Normally it tastes really good, but this time, I don't know if the cook was lazy, but it was mixed with a lot of the burnt grease from the stove.  I am very disappointed because I usually eat at this location.  I'm upset."}
{"text":"The short ribs were amazing!!!!! I was not that impressed with the macaroni salad or rice!"}
{"text":"I like eating here because it's close to work. They're very friendly and they've always gotten my order right today. I ordered the spicy beef with brown rice and cabbage it's amazing just the perfect amount of spice and a lot of food so I had lunch and I'll also have enough for dinner. I do think that the beef quality could be better it's good but there always seems to be a little bit more fat than what should be on the meat. The reason why I don't give this location of 5-star is because at any given time when you go there it smells like a public restroom... now I know you might be asking yourself why would anyone want to eat their ?? well the location is very clean they definitely clean up and their food is great. For however for whatever reason it just has that odor."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to me and I greatly enjoy the food here. I rotate between the bbq chicken plate and the bbq beef plate. The staff seems to be the same consistent crew over the last few years which is nice.  They've on occasion forgetten my side of macaroni salad. Overall, I enjoy coming to this location. Nice staff and quality food."}
{"text":"Food was good. 2nd guessed my self while eating and watching the guy at the counter go to change the trash bag, and take the trash out and go immediately back to the counter to take orders and pack food without washing his hands in between. Several times..."}
{"text":"I don't and never will claim to be a expert on Hawaiian culinary but I know food.  This place is not good!!  If you want to eat fatty beef, short ribs and chicked this is your place.  I usually give a place at least 2 tries because everyone has an off day but I won't be back a second time.  I actually lost my appetite trying to eat the bbq combo plate or should I say bbq fat plate.  Nasty!!!!  Look at what your serving your customers before it goes out of the kitchen!! We tried four sides as well, nothing memorable.  Actually, I'd like to forget about the experiece.   I gave 2 stars because at least it was a very clean restaurant.  Not my cup o' tea.  Bleck!!"}
{"text":"I normally love going to L&L for their Chicken Katsu Curry, but this has to be the WORST location I've been to. 

The Katsu was so overcooked to the point where I could hardly even stick my fork through it- super crunchy, which made it hard to eat. On top of that, the curry sauce that came with it tasted NOTHING like the curry from the other locations I've been to. It was disgusting- salty & had an odd taste to it. I ended up not even using the curry sauce, which is why I order their Katsu Curry in the first place! So disappointed. 

Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I love this location, I love the diner feel of this place also ! They give big portions for reasonable prices. Their drinks are a bit pricey though, but other than that, the place is great overall."}
{"text":"Having the Beef Curry today. It's spicy enough for me ,but the beef is tough. Next time I come I'll probably ask for more veggies."}
{"text":"This place is the worse L&L's. The food was tasted bland and i found a piece hair in my bbq chicken. The place was dirty and had a smell of garbage. I like visiting  and trying L&L's at diffrent states because of the variety. I don't understand how this one could not be at the standards of all the other ones."}
{"text":"Good chain for Hawaiian food but they do not give you enough Mac salad. Huge downer for me."}
{"text":"Very nice service, the food portion is huge, I can't even finish a regualr plate. Taste is good, but little bit oily."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of L&L, especially since I've had better, but I gotta say the mochiko chicken here is pretty good. That's all I order there. Another plus, their \"mini\" plates are pretty big."}
{"text":"I was originally going to go to raising canes next door but noticed L&L had a new location cause of the sign twerling guy. So decided to check it out and order one of my regulars chicken Katsu and fries with no rice and extra mac salad. Everything came out fresh and they brought the food to my table within 10 minutes of placing my order. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I got the #7 -- supposedly three kinds of barbecue on one plate.  The pork was inedible, nothing but tough gristle and bone.  The beef ribs wouldn't come apart and didn't taste good enough to gnaw apart.  The chicken was greasy.  White rice and macaroni salad just added more fat and carbs.  My husband was happier with his fried fish, although he wouldn't say it was great.  It was heavily breaded.  It could be that this isn't our kind of food; it definitely isn't a place we'll go back to.  On the plus side, the people were nice and friendly, and I take no joy in writing this review."}
{"text":"I went to the L&L Hawaiian Barbecue restaurant a couple of times in Washington with my sister, nephews, my mom, and son. We ordered from them for my dad's birthday back in October 2009! The food was great. So when I finally noticed the one on Serene (in a plaza with Walmart, Sam's Club, and other businesses), I had to check them out. I went a few days ago to meet a friend and had the kalua and lau lau meal. The cashier asked if I wanted cabbage with it. I said yes, of course. That was a fantastic meal to grub on. My son isn't into too much hawaiian food, like I am, so he just ate part of my steamed rice. I am only giving them a three star, because I am picky about what I eat, and only been to this one once. I will definitely be going back some time, then give an update. YAY for kalua and lau lau!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and most recently on 2/4/12. 

This place is always clean the cashiers are pretty knowledgeable of what the menu has to offer. In addition to the main menu, there is also a side menu (sharpie board) that offers daily specials and other items not mentioned. 

I'm a huge fan of Hawaiian food and like to try different dishes I've yet to try, and sometimes I feel like some BBQ Chicken, which is what I ordered this time around. The plate sizes that are offered are mini and regular. I always go with the regular, which comes with the main dish (BBQ Chicken in my case), macaroni salad, 2 scoops of which rice and some cabbage. My chicken is always cooked very well, tender and moist. The mac salad and rice were average. 

Overall I really like this place. It's consistent food wise and friendly."}
{"text":"Coming from hawaii... i tell everyone not to go to L&L because they can get better food elsewhere. So i made the mistake of coming here. Ordered a loco moco. Got it within 10 minutes. The place smelled like a dumpster and the food made me sick."}
{"text":"Service is normal. (Not rude and I really appreciate that) Ordered spam musubi, spam fried rice and garlic mahi mahi. Spam musubi was really tasty. Spam fried rice was delicious. Garlic mahi mahi had an excellent garlic flavor. Portions are very decent. Love this place and the food always has excellent flavor. Have had good experiences whether I was dining in or taking out. Food comes out fairly quick but the most important thing to me is that it's quality, it's tasty and has good flavor."}
{"text":"L & L is my favorite Hawaiian BBQ in town.....bra!

Here's why:

1)  The best Kalua pork in the valley.  It was so flavorful and tender.  Order it with cabbage, the crunch adds a wonderful bite to this mouthwatering dish.

2)  Chicken Katsu is also quite good.  Not too oily or greasy, and the right amount of salt made this Katsu a great entree.  

3)  Clean store and friendly staff who are happy to walk those unfamiliar to Island fare through the tasty options on the menu.

4)  Great Value!!  You can get heaps of great food for a very reasonable price, and if you aren't in the mood for a big portion, they offer mini-sized orders, perfect for ladies and skinny wussies.....(Ok, perfect for everyone)  


This is as close to Hawaii as I've been, and while  you probably won't get laid walking in to L & L, you'll definitely get fed with great food."}
{"text":"Got served pink undercooked chicken katsu. I Took it back to the counter to get something else, a loco moco and they never gave it to me. Waited 20 minutes and they didn't even acknowledge me. Never going here again."}
{"text":"I like this place. Not too fancy and a step above fast food, the food is fairly good and always comes out steaming hot. The woman that works the front is so friendly and always smiling. She's also making sure you're OK by giving you updates on the status of your food. As far as the food, I love their spam musubi. It's my favorite thing to get there. Their battered shrimp and fish are good, but I personally could find myself getting tired of them, maybe because their deep fried and have a lot of crust, especially the fish. The short rib is very good. I wish it were meatier. The macaroni is OK, but I find it strange to serve with rice. I know it's a Hawaiian thing, but I would prefer just one starch. For the service, I rank this place higher than I would for the food."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good! Service is fast and food is always fresh. The only complaint I have is how the cashiers can be a little rude. Theyre pretty stingy with silverware and extra napkins which is funny since I paid for the food. Anyway 3 stars from me"}
{"text":"We've been to many L&L's...Waikiki, Glendale, Anaheim, San Jose, but this shop in Las Vegas was the WORST we have ever stepped in.  We ordered the BBQ mix.  The short ribs were undercooked/raw; the chicken was bland; overall, GROSS!!  We will try another L&L in vegas."}
{"text":"I love L&L Hawaiian.   This one though is a little bit different from the ones that I have been to.   The menu and decor looks like L&L but that's just about it.  The BBQ mix grill was very bland.  My favorite Mac salad was a big disappointment...just didn't taste right.  The Loco moco also a big flop...patties tasted like Swanson Salisbury microwave patties.  There was not enough gravy too.  And here the big WTF moment...Christian rock music blaring from the speakers while we ate!  Never experienced that in any L&L in Hawaii, California,  or the other locations in las vegas."}
{"text":"Don't let the empty parking lot fool you, the food is great here. It seemed like they might have been closed when we arrived around 3pm, but a few people came in after we did. The decor and old food signs could be updated and it seemed like the place catered more to takeuot more than dine in due to entree being served in styrophome containers, but due to the delicious food I would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I am 100% positive that this place stole my credit card info. I received an email from my bank. I saw 1 transaction that I didn't make there. Also fraudulent transactions at Babies R Us, Burlington Coat Factory, TJ Maxx (all within walking distance of L&L). 
DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"this place is the best, went there after my mechanic from liberty tech and tire told me , the food was awesome, nice and friendly people, food are very reasonably priced and taste great"}
{"text":"This is my first time here,i had before eaten but never had i personally order nor been inside a L&L location,however today was actually finally my first time and i can say i enjoyed it a lot and ill have to stop by again soon. I had the BBQ mix plate and it was delicious,great flavor,freshly made and fast,this location seem to be a hidden gem but those that know about it,will agree with me,at least that's what i hope. Am thinking ordering something with shrimp next time"}
{"text":"Food is BOMBBBBBBBB. Cant go a month without eating from here. I live right around this area, lucky me:)"}
{"text":"Man! I love their food.... let me introduce something good ( personal opinion) :

37. Spam for sure!!!!!
29. Kalua & Lau Lau combo in one regular size
15. Loco Moco in mini size ( for lunch )
21. Chicken Katsu in regular size 
46. Aloha Saimin

Mini size means one scope of rice and
Regular size means two scopes of rice :)

um... it's 2:13 in the morning and I'm hungry now while thinking of their food. SPAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I personally think L & L has better Spam than Island Flavor even tho IF is more popular :)

{"text":"It's the closest you can get to Hawaiian food in Vegas (kinda) BUT not as close as the L & L's from Hawaii.  Luv their mac salads here! =) This particular location, they'll let you customize your plates which is great! The other locations don't (I believe.  The one closest to my home doesn't anyway).  They also have mochiko chicken here (which isn't all that great but it's alright).  I've had way better & this is the only location I know of anyway that serves mochiko chicken.  Their other foods are pretty consistant.  The workers are real nice & they do keep the place clean.  They have other stuff you can buy on the side that's from Hawaii like the School Kine Cookies & I think some crack seed stuff.  The other location closest to my home in Henderson don't have em.  So if you wanna customize your plate, this is the location to come to."}
{"text":"This location is closest to my home in Henderson.  This was the first L & L we hit up when we first moved to Vegas.  I was like thank goodness... Hawaiian food!!! I didn't even eat too much of L & L's in Hawaii when I was living there being that there were way better places but this is one of the places to get your Hawaiian food fix here in Vegas. Reason for the 4-stars... it's close to where I live.  The mac salad is always good.  My fav is the chicken katsu plate or the pork lau lau.  This location, they won't let you make up your own combo plates like the other location on Serene.  And they don't have mochiko chicken here.  I believe so anyway since I last ate here probably a few months ago.  Prices are reasonable.  And the portions are pretty good sizes whether it's a mini or a regular plate.  I don't like to eat in here much as I don't have that \"clean feeling\" every time we do eat in there.  It's a good thing I bring antibacterial wipes where ever I go! LOL! We've done catering w/ them as well.  Mainly for the mac salad & chicken katsu's & had no problems.  I've noticed the sauce for the chicken katsu can be inconsistant at times.  There are a few workers who have been really nice to us & some that just seem like they don't wanna be there but watevers...."}
{"text":"I had chicken katsu and he had BbQ ribs (kalbi). My katsu was crispy but chicken very thin. I remember last time the chicken was thicker.. Still good though. His ribs was well done. He enjoyed it. A lot of rice. Mac salad good. Person at register was very friendly. Good visit."}
{"text":"Malasadas were cooked in the same oil as the fish, so they tasted pretty shrimp. Not like the malasadas you get on the island."}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly and the food is fantastic. Definitely would recommend trying!

We tried the BBQ chicken and the chicken katsu. Both are great. The macaroni salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had the jalya pork rice bowl and it tasted great. It came out pretty quick. The dining area is really small so it may not be good to dine in during busy times. The guy at the register was friendly and helpful when it came to choosing what to order."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews but I had to take the time and sign up mainly to review this place.

I usually come here twice a week with my wife and get the Chicken Katsu and BBQ mix. We just go with regulars because they are so large we end up with leftovers for lunch the next day. It doesn't matter what you end up ordering, the portions and taste are both excellent.

The taller cashier in the front already has our orders ready when he sees us walks in and the dining area is always when we dine in.

Overall it's a solid place to eat with cheap prices and large portions."}
{"text":"While returning from a recent trip to Hawaii, my husband and I saw an ad in the in-flight magazine for the ramen burger at L&L. We were intrigued, so I HAD to stop to try one when I passed the local L&L here in Vegas.

I've eaten at L&L before, but I've never had their burger, let alone their ramen burger. The burger itself was a pleasant surprise. Not sure if it had loco moco gravy on it or something else, but there was a tasty sauce that was pretty addictive. The meat was sandwiched between two huge fried ramen patties, which took the role of the bun. This is a pretty ingenious idea, but it didn't quite work because the ratio was off. If each patty were half its size, it would have been a lot better, but there was way too much ramen in relation to the meat.

So the ramen burger was a one-trick pony, but what about the other food at L&L? As I said, on this visit, I only had the burger (which I brought home to share with my spouse). But they offer a slew of other Hawaiian favorites, like short ribs, saimin, and chicken katsu. I like their Spam musubi, and I think next time I'll get the loco moco (double rice, no mac salad) because that was some good brown gravy.

If you're missing Hawaii and find yourself here on the Ninth Island, L&L offers a little taste of aloha. And they offer \"mini\" portions of most dishes, which is both cost- and waistline-friendly!"}
{"text":"I have eaten @ L&L in Irvine, CA. Irvine L&L is good. Henderson L&L is subpar.
I came in Saturday night after an evening of partying. I had not eaten all day. Basically, I was starving. I ordered half Chicken Katsu and half Short Ribs.... 

The Chicken Katsu is alright, its not very flavorful and kind of dry. The chicken katsu sauce is is bland, no flavor at all. The short ribs were sour for some reason. Sour bbq? Gross. The rice is ok. The macaroni salad was mostly mayo. I didn't like it. 

Final judgement? Avoid this place. It's not worth the money."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding i definitely recommend it if your in the area. The service is awesome and fast ill be back on my next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"Right in the same area as Costco, this is a good place for good,tasty, low end food.
The place feels like a fast food joint. 5he menu is a hybrid of Hawaiian, Japanese(katsu) and Mongolian too.
I've never had Hawaiian food, in Hawaii nor las Vegas.
I liked what I had #3 the BBQ mix plate for 6.25. That was for a mini portion that was almost too much to eat.
Very tasty, the chicken, BBQ beef, and the short ribs.
I wouldn't say the quality of the meat was great,it was a bit fatty.
They serve everything on stryrofoam and plastic forks and knife,one time use stuff. 
Very sad.
In a pinch I might comeback to try the curry, the loco moco.the bbq chicken was good enough to come back for. but not an every day, week, month thing."}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE, and everything was delicious! Absolutely loved the canned Hawaiian juices too. That was a neat surprise we weren't anticipating."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here, love the food and the staff is friendly. My favorite item is the BBQ mix with macaroni salad and steamed rice. I highly recommend, will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The young woman at cashier was friendly however the food portions was not so friendly. I ordered a mini loco moco and it really just came with a small scoop of rice and mac on the side. Usually the gravy hamburger and egg is over rice already, not this time.

Bathroom was disgusting needs cleaning and updating"}
{"text":"Portion size was good but Kalua pork was very dry. Keoki brand Lau Lau is always good."}
{"text":"I'm a Hawaiian food Lover! I stick to the basic katsu chicken, or bbq chicken love  the macaroni salad. Kalua Pork wasn't too great for me.."}
{"text":"\"Mahalo!\"


Ahhh.... the calm my soul feels when I walk into this place and hear local words that welcome me back to the island. This place beats out ono's on their katsu hands down. Their Mac salad is always on point with l&l Mac salad even on the island. My typical order involves lau lau but because they had to raise their  prices to nearly $12 a plate, I'm afraid I will have to settle for a mini plate. 


For first timers, get the chicken katsu. Or teriyaki (BBQ) chicken. I never liked the short ribs (Hawaiian style)."}
{"text":"Order the chicken Katsu for $8.50 the chicken was fried just right was tender and juicy came with a side order of rice and macaroni and cheese! Yes it was very tasty after a night of gambling and drinking it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming to this location knowing the young man that works here is so rude and mean!!!! It must be the convenience of location.  This is my third time after realizing he hates his job. There will not be a fourth."}
{"text":"I would love to give it 5 stars because the food is alway good.. But the service is really poor the girl at the register was very  rude. I asked for ketchup and she just dropped them all over the table and when she brings your food she just slams it on the table it really sucks because it makes you not want to come back so now I just order it to go"}
{"text":"Love L&Lhawaiian BBQ always a lot to eat they give a lot of food and there fast and friendly"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and a disgrace to the other L and L bbqs. Unsanitary, small portions, cheap owners. One refill per drink only. Unreal"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed the lunch specials here for a healthy alternative.  I always get the garlic shrimp with macaroni salad.  Last time I was here it seemed like the portion of shrimp had gone down though...I think I seriously counted like 6 shrimps, and they are not jumbo, more of like the 22-30ish count size.  oh well, great flavors though."}
{"text":"Awesome food I always get the chicken katsu and Hawaiian bbq chicken with rice and broccoli  so good!"}
{"text":"Ive tried everything from the chicken katsu to the hawaiian bbq chicken thisntime around im goin for the hawaiian bbq beef theyre all delicious just to think I never gave them a shoot while living in cali n waited to come to lv"}
{"text":"Very excited to say there is a new person at the counter who is very nice and friendly. Same great food, and now with excellent customer service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite L&L location in Vegas. I work nearby on convention center and find myself here daily. The owner and cashier are nice and the cooks know what they're doing. 

I recommend the garlic chicken. I've tried the garlic chicken at other L&L locations and it's  usually terrible but this place makes it amazing! My favorite thing on the menu forsure!"}
{"text":"For the price, it's not a bad deal. I got the wings today. 9 of them plus rice and a small amount of mac salad. I normally get the seafood combo. It comes with mahi mahi, teriyaki chicken, and shrimp. I always tell them to delete the shrimp and give an extra piece of fish. Normally the fish is thick, moist and good. Last time over cooked and dry. The teriyaki chicken always good. The shrimp always horrible. Don't get it. Too thin, too much bread, too dry. Step back from their shrimp. 
All in all, the chicken always good and the mahi mahi most times good. Not great. But good, and enough of it."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Went a few times before and didn't really know what to order, I thought it was ok but not great. Went back the other day to give it another try and they had a new plate on the menu, \"low carb BBQ\" in three different sizes. It's eggs, chicken, beef and short ribs with no sides. As I am trying to limit carbs, this seemed good. It was amazing. The eggs were a perfect over-easy. Each of the meats was great. I will be eating here a lot from now on. You can always add a few sides if you are craving carbs."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero; it would be zero! The cashier did not listen at all on how I wanted the transaction. I wanted cash, and the rest on my debit card. And instead, she charged it onto my card.. And didn't even apologize! And also there was only 3 ppl in the restaurant.. And my order of chicken katsu took like 20 mins.. Despite having two cooks.. And when she finally called for my order number. She refused to give me my order (to go) until I show her my receipt.. Even tho there was no one in front of me.. Smh. Horrible customer service and the store doesn't look sanitize. And they charge for refills.. Unlike other L&L.. And the cashier was wiping the soy sauce and hot sauce bottles, with the same wipes as what she used to clean tables and her register with! I will file a report w the Health Department in relation to this! Smfh"}
{"text":"First time visiting L&L Hawaiian BBQ. The young gentleman at the register was pleasant & welcoming. Menu was simple. Made it easy for me to choose what to eat, since it was my first time. My oldest daughter ordered The Fried Shrimp plate. I ordered the Grilled Chicken plate. Wait wasn't long at all. Good ticket time for the kind of food that is being served here, in my opinion. I asked the cashier where I could grab silverware as I was getting ready to leave. He responded. \"I put two sets of silverware in the bag for you with napkins\". 5 stars to that cashier. It is my pet peeve as I also work in a restaurant, that I always give each and every customer that takes food Togo silverware and napkins in their bag without even asking if they need it or not. Super cool dude! That made my day. Good training! Also, let me say the food here was amazing!!! Bomb.com as we say... 5 stars to the chef. I can taste the love. :) Great first experience, we will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I went in to get dinner for my son and I, ordered two Katsu chickens or # 18s as it was listed... Got home and sat down to eat and as I began to eat I realized that the food was not hot and the chickens looked as if had been out into cold grease or had been sitting for awhile..... Needless to say we tossed it and decided to cook after all...didn't want to chance it.."}
{"text":"I have never experienced Hawaiian food until I moved to Vegas about 2.5 years ago and while leaving Walmart I decided to give this place a try. I had no clue what Hawaiian food was so i felt like i would take a risk and see what they had to offer. I was so surprised it's not that different from our food the things we tried was the bbq chicken and, my husband got the seafood platter. The many visit we made since then we tend to stick with what we like so we ordered the same thing. One thing that surprised me was the macaroni salad, this stuff is amazing!! its the first thing i eat each time. I ordered my same today and my husband as well but one of the meat choices he changed to was kaluah pig with cabbage, it was so delish perfectly seasoned and cooked it's now one of my favorites. The place is always clean and the staff is friendly and you don't feel rushed to order your food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good amount of food that I can feed 2 people off of one plate. The price is great for the amount of food you geat."}
{"text":"These guys are not ver compromising with simple requests. It is part of my job to create realistic lifestyles for those with strict diet parameters (diabetes, heart disease, etc). With that being said, if I know that a restaurant does not compromise simple requests, then I won't recommend them to my clients. I can tell my 50 year old newly diabetic client who works 70 hrs a week and has no idea how to eat healthy that this place is off the list for lunch. I simply ordered a chicken bowl with no rice and just vegetables. Not completely ridiculous. She stated that the only vegetables I can have is cabbage. No problem, Im ok with that. Then lastly she states the cabbage has to be raw. I politely request that they saut√© or steam the cabbage so that it is more palatable. She replies... we have a strict policy that we do not cook our cabbage. I politely ask again, ma'am I can only have protein and vegetables right now, can you ask your chef if he can just heat up some cabbage... she declined and offered me macaroni salad. I politely declined. I don't know if this really is a policy, or if my request was that off the wall. Anyhow, thats my experience."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything here.  I see it as Hawaiian fast food, but whatever is awesome! Whenever you want that BBQ fix get it here.  They make their own teriyaki sauce too.  It's awesome. Like ridiculously awesome, and I can eat that macaroni salad forever.  Sorry I'm hungry and about to eat this amazing mixed BBQ plate. It's worth a try! Definitely addicting!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. The person that takes your order is completely rude and has the energy of a slug. I said how long will.it be as we are starving, she pretended to not hear me. So I said again DID YOU HEAR ME? HOW LONG WILL IT BE ...SHE SAYS FINALLY NO EYE CONTACT 10 MINUTES. Are 15 minutes I got up and asked again.
I will never be back because both times were the same, bad service takes forever and Rude.But at least the food was hot! Deserving 1 star even though that's how it should come."}
{"text":"I never really like to leave bad reviews but I feel like I really should inform people of my multiple experiences with this company.

Now I've read that a lot of people have received bad service but this has nothing to do with that.  It is strictly in regards to the quality and taste of the food, which I might add, has been consistently bad.  I could be over exaggerating a bit, but the food is terrible!

Mind you, I mentioned that I have visited this place (various locations) multiple times because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  But I'm sorry, they (L&L) have truly disappointed me, every, single, time.

I have had the Chicken Katsu, BBQ Plate, Loco Moco, and Seafood Platter.  That along with the Macaroni Salad and Spam Musabi are horrible!  All is bland and made with cheap ingredients, at least that's how it tastes.  This was my fourth, and now, my last visit.  I will go as far as saying that I hate this place!

Remember, spending money on somewhat fast food like this can get a bit pricey, especially if you are buying multiple meals.  I, like many other people like to get my money's worth.  Well, I have only felt ripped off each and every time.  That's my fault.  Pardon my ignorance and stupidity for going back.

My suggestion, try Aloha Kitchen, Maui Rose, or Ross J's.  I haven't had any problems with these establishments.  

Thanks and have a nice day."}
{"text":"There's nothing like an Hawai'ian plate lunch to keep you going through a day: meat, rice, and macaroni salad.  Although it's a chain, L&L is actually pretty good.  The BBQ mix plate is a combination of bulgogi, kalbi ribs, and grilled chicken, along with the carbs.  Add a side of Kimchi and I don't have to go to Chinatown for a good Korean feast at a reasonable price.

The other Hawai'ian specialties are just as good: Spam musubi, Kahlua pork, Loco Moko; it's all good.

Aloha and Mahalo."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Everything on the menu is good. They have reasonable prices for the amount of food you get, which is A LOT!  

The Loco Moco if you've never had it is hamburger patties over rice which is then covered in brown gravy and topped with an egg!

Heart attack on a plate but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii. I'm not a huge fan of L&L. We came to this location after a trip to Costco. We had the Chicken Cutlet, Seafood Mix & Chicken Katsu Curry. Our Katsu was a little dry, I wish we had more sauce to moisten it out. My moms Seafood Mix looked a little tastier then our chicken but not by much. The tables and chairs were pretty dirty& not well kept. I would recommend this place if you just want a quick meal & nothing fancy at all. 
Not Hawaiian atmosphere at all, like you would think it would be. Island Flavor and Aloha kitchen are more homey to us."}
{"text":"I love the bbq mix plate which has chicken beef and ribs with rice. A cup of macaroni salad comes with it, too, which i like even though I don't eat macaroni salad as a rule.  This is the first time i ordered spam musubi. $2.25 for one piece? A bit pricey, i think, but I'll taste it. A hot bowl of saimin would really taste good on this cold night, but i'll reserve it for next time."}
{"text":"Surrounding environment, warm and thoughtful service, acid, spicy, sweet and salty taste. Superb cooking skills, fried \"fried\", \"cooked\", \"fried\", \"steam\" stew \"rinse\" color, flavor and taste. Dinner is the first choice? i really like this restaurant. i usually eat with my friends."}
{"text":"Food was great. I've eaten at plenty of L&L Hawaiian BBQ locations and this one was by far the greatest food and environment I've experienced but the customer service was horrible!! The cashier had a very rude attitude as if I was bothering her free-time between customers by walking in for my lunch break. I came here with a friend and she was nice with him. Asked what sides he wanted, if he wanted anything to drink, and had a smile the whole time. I'm guessing she didn't know we came in together. When she took my order she wasn't smiling and in fact was rushing me. Never asked if I wanted a drink nor offer or gave me options to change my sides. Overall food was great, environment was clean and welcoming, but I'm guessing the cashier isn't happy with her job that much :("}
{"text":"this is the most nastiest place to eat, the guy drops the chicken on the ground and loos around if anyone is looking, then takes his towel to wipe it off and dips it back in the sauce... then still sevred it to a 8 or 9 year old kid sitting behind me.... do not.  i repeat do not ever go to this place"}
{"text":"Really good and cheap lunch place. The girl at the counter was sweet and was multitasking many different things which I can appreciate. My BBQ beef was tasty, rice was perfect, along with a rich macaroni salad. My boyfriend got fried mahi mahi which he gives a 5/5 perfectly fried with steam coming out of every bite. My Thai tea boba was made perfectly, the tapioca was soft, chewy and delicious! Great stop on our trip!"}
{"text":"Can be good at times depending on who's cooking the food typical of a franchise eatery some menu items are pretty universal for Hawaiian food. The katsu curry combo is my favorite from the menu"}
{"text":"We had a hotel party and we decided to order Hawaiian BBQ, it was a great choice, we order for 10 people and we had the chicken and the beef. I really enjoyed the beef it was perfect and nice and classy for a party better then pizza all the time and the price was reasonable. Will definitely order here again. The food was prep on time and the pick up was simple. We called I early and paid in advance.  Made it fast and easy.  Also good place to eat if you're thinking of a quick bite. Great for togo they give a good portion size."}
{"text":"Instead of taking more people's order. How about taking care of the people that already ordered. 
Waited over 25 minutes just to receive COLD food. That was just sitting there...
They need to get their priorities straight and loose the attitudes. 
Im fairly irritated and will not be back. 

The teenage employees they have working the counter are extremely rude and disrespectful. 

Overall grade F"}
{"text":"Visited L&L tonight, it was my first time at this location. I had the fried fish/shrimp/bbq chicken combo, that also came with white rice and macaroni salad. The line was short, wait was minimal and the food was delicious! The portion sizes are large, I even ended up having over half of the food leftover.  If you're looking for a quick filling Hawaiian meal, this is a great spot to go!"}
{"text":"Love this place, a little taste of home.....
The service is as expected, the employees are friendly. The food is just what I want when I'm in a local food kinda mood...."}
{"text":"From living in Hawaii and knowing what good L&L Hawaiian bbq tastes like I was quite shocked at the quality of the meat here. I ordered the short ribs regular size. First off the short rib was disgustingly fatty and normally in short rib there is separation between the meat. Here there was none. The meat I did manage to find was extremely rubbery and I had to chew for a very long time to be able to swallow it. For $15 with no drink I would expect a decent meal as I could get a good meal anywhere else for that price. I only ate half the meal before I was too disgusted to continue. The rice was decent as was the mac salad, also the cashier was somewhat nice and thats the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one. I really hate wasting money because someone wasted an ingredient and I hope they find a way to fix this or buy their meat from a different vendor."}
{"text":"I ordered spam eggs and rice and Portuguese sausage eggs and rice. The plates came out both spam and very burnt. Upon relaying this to the cashier she informed the cook who stated that he didn't know the difference between the spam or Portuguese sausage. The cashier was very nice but the food is horrible and the restaurant is disgusting. The floors were sticky after being just mopped and you can feel the layer of grease on the tables and chairs. I was already hesitant about eating here and I won't come back again."}
{"text":"Bbq rib is not fully cooked, almost no sauce. Chicken kastu has very water sauce, no flavor. Don't plan to go there again. Not a good place for quick bite. 5 guys burgers is good choice, my kids love it."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've been to many L&L's in California and Nevada.  This one impressed me enough to garner a review.  I've learned when you're visiting Las Vegas, you need to find some balance.  Last night and into the morning it was all about a pub/casino crawl between joints on Fremont Street.  Today, it was an arduous hike and rock scramble in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.  

Headed back to the strip, the idea of grub from L&L Hawaiian crept into my head.  A back and forth chat with snarky Siri (who seems to get bitchy when you yell at her) sent us to this L&L, which isn't far from Red Rock Canyon (and is located across Charleston Blvd. and Red Rock Casino).  

This operation is Asian owned and operated, which is a plus in my book.  The line cooks can easily be seen behind a low counter making food to order.  It takes just enough wait time to make you believe your food was cooked to order (and not just reheated). I ordered a \"mini\" BBQ chicken, which was given a complimentary super-sized upgrade to full plate meal.  Score!  The food was tasty as expected and hit the spot after a long desert hike.  

If you want to make your meal a little heathier, they will substitute brown rice for white and veggies (mainly broccoli) for the macaroni salad, which tends to be hit and miss for taste anyway.  They also serve a number of Asian inspired dishes (from their own menu) such as chicken pot stickers.  If you're in the area and looking for a tasty meal at value prices, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Walked in and the girl up front was very rude. Said they wouldn't substitute short rib for beef and they said they couldn't do it. Also mentioned that every other L&L does this except them. Last time I will be here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while we were in town overnight.  This is a chain restaurant, if you've eaten at one L&L, you've eaten at them all.  This location in particular was a little small, but the cashier was very nice and helpful. 

We ended up sharing a combo plate with the teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu. The servings are large!   Greens, rice, macaroni salad and your entree compose this meal.  The macaroni salad is delish!   The food was served hot and had all the flavors of Hawaii.  

I would recommend this place for a quick, delicious meal.  Nothing fancy, but it is always consistent."}
{"text":"Luckily this place is right down the street from where I live. I usually like to come here to grab a quick bite to eat. The service is pretty quick and the food comes out fresh. The best part is they are very generous with their portions. I usually get the kalbi/katsu combo, and they give you a lot. The katsu is nice and crispy, but the kalbi never seems to be just right. On one occasion it was kind of bland, and another time it was really tough. All in all I recommend this place if you're into Hawaiian food and looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great fast Hawaiian food. Lots of choices and most of them taste great. We love getting it to go. Fast and convenient."}
{"text":"Excellent food, with a cultural difference, deffinetely a place to go once a week to have a different flavor introduced into yoir weekly eating"}
{"text":"Sometimes I get a serious craving for this place. The spam musubi is by far my favorite. The BBQ chicken plate is my second favorite option. I usually take my food to go so I can't comment on atmosphere, but of you like Hawaiian food check it out. It really is quite good."}
{"text":"Recently found out they make malasada, so I had to stop in  a single order comes with 10 & it's okay not to share. Taste the best right when you get them. 
I usually call to pick up and they're always prompt, gave this place 4/5 only because of consistency. 
I typically order the mini katsu and its not as fresh ordering later in the afternoon..could be that one time, but I swing by earlier now. 

Punch card are only for regular sized orders :("}
{"text":"Delicious food, steaming hot and fresh. Literally felt like I was on Oahu eating at my favorite l and l eating local kine grinds. Ono!"}
{"text":"This location is close enough to UNLV to get in and out of on lunch hour.  And, there's usually adequate parking out front.  It can also be quick, if you order something easy to prep like the mini laulau plate. Probably just a quick toss in the steamer or microwave and that ti leaf bundle of luau leaves, pork and salted fish is hot and ready to roll (I got my order in minutes, ahead of the group that ordered in front of me).  

I usually forget to ask for substitutions of brown rice and green salad, so I end up picking at the glutinous white rice and mac salad, but anyway it's primarily the protein I'm after.  Plus, the laulau satisfies my dietary need.

The day I visited, there were a couple of tables open in the modest dining area and as far as cleanliness goes, it was okay.  I would love to have received some genuinely friendly counter service, but didn't.  In reality, the cashiers at L&L locations are usually more accustomed to obtaining a quick food order and ringing it up, than providing patrons with a stellar customer experience--that's just how it goes.

That being said, it's an average kind of plate lunch place--adequate for a quick meal, selected from a diverse menu.  If you want a higher level of customer service and much more flavorful Hawaii island-style food, you know Yelpers will help you find someplace way mo' bettah!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about mainland L&Ls...but the food just doesn't have the same taste as L&Ls back home in Hawaii.  The food is edible and very bland.  Beware when paying, though.  The prices on the menu board say one thing, but check your receipt...you may have been charged more.  I brought this to the attention of the worker who was ringing up my purchase, and his response was \"I can't do anything...that's what it says on the computer.\"  Really?  Businesses need to realize they can't advertise their price publicly, and then charge more at the register.  Very bad business practice!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We ordered barbecue chicken, seafood and short ribs. So much food good enough for 2 meals. Service was super great and friendly. Cashier is amazing. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Same owners as the one on Buffalo/Lake Mead & the one on W Charleston across from Costco. They're the best! No other L&L COMPARES!!! Hubby always gets garlic shrimp almost every time!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time cause it's close to my house and well I grew up on L and L food. The menu they post is well done and executed consistently. What ever I order is always what I can expect it to be. However  the Menu is not as large as the ones you find in Hawaii you can still order the favorites. Spam Musubi and and Mini Chicken Katsu to go. Great daily lunch specials. Fast friendly service. A soda machine and a little radio in the dinning area make this place good times to just relax in on a hot day. I just wish they did lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Always nice to have see L&L's this location is clean and easy to find. The menus are displayed very well so people can see the options. Each table is set for 4 people but can easily be moved for more. The location had 2 TVs for entertainment.

The food is well proportioned and I always get the Kalua Pig with no cabbage. My daughter always gets a Spam Musabi (her all time favorite!) it's definitely great and quick place to eat!!!! Def try it out.v"}
{"text":"Service going down hill.... I prefer going to Aloha BBQ on Craig Rd. You get more for your money"}
{"text":"pretty bad paid 12 dollars for the mix bbq. got the plate home and there more fat/grissle then meat on my plate, the \"ribs\" are a joke they sliced the meat about 1/4\" thick. all of the meat is cut super thin looks nothing like the pictures."}
{"text":"Food is pretty simple, but always great.  Service varies anywhere from ok to really good at this location.  Love Hawaiian food in general, so giving 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Usually we get the mix plate, chicken katsu and musubis for the kids!"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, these L&L chains are usually crowded. there was no wait here so that made me skeptical but it wasn't actually bad but it wasn't as good as the LA or Oahu locations. The service was nice, food was fresh and quick and I  enjoyed it all with my strawberry guava Hawaiian juice. I got the chicken teriyaki plate with spam on the side."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Bento. XD I always go with my friend. The price is not too high, and a plate is enough for both of us to eat."}
{"text":"I honestly think this place needs some serious work, as in customer satisfaction type of work. I ordered the fried mahi mahi, bbq beef and a side of chicken katsu.

The chicken katsu tasted refried and all you can bite into is the Panko batter with not enough meat! The mahi mahi was ok, definitely freezer brand, and the bbq beef was hella stale. 

Now the worst--there is a sign on their soda dispenser that you only can get (1) refill and their bathrooms state in large letters customers only. Like what if a person who ate there before couldn't use the bathroom? That's really stingy and greedy if you ask me. Btw the katsu sauce always comes with the chicken katsu, a person should not even have to ask for it.

I'm taking my hunger elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I became a fan of this spot while doing a show around the block. This was the healthiest, quickest thing in the area. Consider the area for a moment, now tell me where you would eat :)

There are many combinations you can get. Can't go wrong with BBQ Chicken and Brown rice.

The staff is decent. Mostly young and inexperienced kids who at least try to be helpful.The place is typically filthy, but this is due to the neighborhood and those who visit. I imagine it'd take a whole second staff just to keep the bathroom decent.

So, if you are at the intersection of Maryland & Sahara and you are hungry for something that isn't crack, L&L may be your best bet.

Also, don't eat with chopsticks. You will look like a tool..."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is always good and the young man at the cash register is always friendly and nice. Today I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl with extra chicken. SO delicious. Also, if you get a chance, try  their \"Loco Moco\", it's to die for:)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location 2-3 times a week for several months.  I always order a low carb plate or super low carb plate but I substitute the BBQ beef for more short rib and/or chicken.  Tonight (12/12/2017) I visited this location at 4:45 pm.  I asked if I could get the super low carb plate and get \"more short rib and less chicken\" as the chicken has more carbs and less fat.  

My register attendant asked the lady to her right at the other register and she said \"no we can't subsitute short ribs for chicken, we can only do the reverse\". Her tone was rude as well.   Then I said \"well I don't like the BBQ beef could I substitute short ribs for the BBQ beef?\"   She said no.  

She offered no alternative.  It was as if. she had already made up her mind to not give me what I want.   Meanwhile accross town at Island Flavor (another Hawaiian chain, much much better by the way) they are always friendly and willing to give me exactly what I want.  They even substituted eggs for rice!! 

I will not ever return to this location.   It was my regular eating spot and now that I've encountered this one crabby and disgruntled employee I will not return."}
{"text":"Don't know what the problem is. All the service I've gotten has been great! Their BBQ chicken is amazing! I reccomend their short  ribs as well. Great  for low carb, too! Eat healthy with their atkins plate!"}
{"text":"One thing I noticed about L& L is that they are not all made equal! This location is \"okay \" as opposed to the one on Maryland and flamingo. The portions are huge which is great. I can usually get two meals out of my chicken katsu. The bf ordered BBQ short ribs. My food was fine, but his beef was SUPER salty. It was as if he was eating a beef flavored bouillon.  Usually salty is good, but this was a little over board. Hopefully it was a one time mistake as I love Hawaiian!!! 

The dining area was nice and clean. They had lots of bamboo and lots of island pics. One of the few fast food joints I don't mind dining in. However, be aware when entering and exiting as the strip mall it is located in is not the safest and there are plenty of vultures preying on patrons to beg for money!"}
{"text":"Newest and best in town. I would dare to say on par with the L & Ls back home other than seafood and that is impossible to match that close to the ocean."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago this was my first Hawaiian restaurant experience. I was definitely happy. I had the chicken saimon which is like noodle soup. It was good and the chicken had great flavor. I also had the spam musubi, which is now one of my favorite things to eat. Granted I'm no expert on Hawaiian food, but this hit the spot. I'll be back.

When I returned I had the Chicken Saimon again and than the Chicken Katsu rice bowl. Both good.....very satisfied."}
{"text":"Good food reasonably priced. Kahlua pork and cabbage is my all time favorite.  They are friendly people. The restaurant itself is clean but could use some remodeling."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Hawaiian fast food, overall. I'm super bummed that the one location in Manhattan closed before I could ever check it out, so whenever I'm on the west coast I make it a point to grab some L&L. 

Can't go wrong with the BBQ mix platter, it can feed a family and has a nice variety of the different meats they have. The mac salad that it comes with is also on point - just carrots and macaroni but delicious!

I also love their spam musubi as a quick, hearty snack."}
{"text":"The food is not to complain here, we had the curry chicken katsu and hawaiian bbq combo (korean rib, pork, beef, rice & macaroni salad), and aloha saimen. All sooo delectable with the egg, spam, green onion combo in the saimen noodle soup. Sounds really strange, but you gotta try it, it is deliious! 

It's really too bad that it took 30 min. for me to get my food, there were only 3 customers in the store, and we were all taking it to go...so why does it take that long? It looked like there was only 1 person running the register and cooking at the same time. Wish the service was as good as the food!"}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite places to stop by & eat a good home cooked meal with out breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I don't know what happened to all the people were saying about the server. During my visit, I had a most satisfied visit comparing to all the other location. When i walked in to this location, I saw all the table were nice and clean. not like all the comments said the tables were dirty and nasty, I am not sure if they recently change their performance or just be like that all the time. I would totally come back for my Hawaii BBQ in this place.

FOOD? their chicken katsu was crispy and hot. The quantity was huge and it is enough for two people. I would recommend you guys to try their chicken katsu.

               short ribs were good and not over fatty. I like how they cook the short ribs with marinated sauce together, it keeps all the favorite in the meat.

 Overall, i got a good visit. And not sure with all the other yelpers were saying about the bad services. I would come back to this place to try their other stuffs on the menu and recommend my friends to come there try some Hawaii BBQ food."}
{"text":"Its ok. Just the location is bad and there are bums out side constantly asking for change or food. Can't have a decent meal."}
{"text":"Honestly better flavor of foods here than any other larger chains like Ono Hawaiian BBQ.

BBQ Mix is #1 so is the Curry Mix....All Rice makes everything nice!"}
{"text":"Last time we had decent service, but the sever named Lily (according to the receipt) was flat out rude this time. She snapped over me trying to take pictures of the menu (which I was doing so since they didn't have a copy of their menu, again). I understand some places not allowing that, but she did not have to be so nasty about it! She also had an attitude when I explained that I needed another box (meal wasn't for me) and tried to continue questioning me about it. 

Food is great, but I will try going to another location."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of L & L, but this location made short of my expectations. The food was prepared relatively quickly, but it was not at all as tasty as some of the other locations I've visited. The bathrooms were a mess as well. Decent food for someone hungry and on the go, but I probably won't visit this location again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to eat here tonight, but unfortunatly they are no longer in business. I'm sad to say we only got to enjoy them once. If they ever open another location around here, we're definitely going. Until then, we'll miss you L&L!"}
{"text":"This L&L is bad. It's run down. Needs some attention inside and the food has no taste. They need to replace it with an aloha kitchen they are way better."}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian take out from a bizarre former-diner space. 
Check for signage all around the front desk for specials on lumpia, rangoons, and (wait for it)-- RAMEN BURGERS. Didn't try that this visit, though.

Opted for the \"healthy\" garlic shrimp plate- $10 for fried shrimp topped with a bunch of chopped garlic on top of about a pound of brown rice. Making rice brown doesn't inherently make it healthy, but props for trying.

I will go back for the Spam musubi though- it's essentially spam nigiri, but it's enormous and surprisingly delicious, savory with just the right amount of gravy not to make it too messy."}
{"text":"Last time we ate here with my family was 4-5yrs ago and since then we regreted, most food we had was too salty to no flavor.  Never ate here again. 

Today my husband and i thought to give it another try, maybe they improved. NOPE i couldnt even enjoy my kalua pig :/ very peppery and it does not taste as its supposed too, i didnt eat it all and my husband ordered the Hawaiian bbq mix and his food barely has flavors and oh the kimchy had no taste also and very dry. 

Im sorry l&l i dont think well ever be coming back or even recommend. Good luck.

Well stick to aloha kitchen and ross js."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me 3.00 for the smallest side of rice this customer has ever seen. This place is way over priced for a hole in the wall eatery. The rice is not good either. Nothing compared to real Hawaiian food. Just a word of advice go somewhere else if you have ever had real Hawaiian food or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with the CASHIER, Ms. Ana. She is the absolute rudest person I've ever encountered! This was my first time coming to this location and never stepping foot in it again. I always go to the one on Maryland and Sahara where their customer service has always been amazing! According to Ana they don't substitute their rice on their plates even if you pay extra, they don't have brown rice and they cannot add steamed veggies to your plate, which is one of the usuals for me at the other L&L's. Thank you Ana for your shitty service!"}
{"text":"I know that this is a Hawaiian BBQ place, but I love their french fries!  I'm not crazy about BBQ of any kind but my husband loves this place.  We go & he gets his fill of Hawaiian BBQ & I get french fries.  BOOM.  We are both happy.  The food is great but they need a bigger space.  I'm happy that they literally get so much business that the restaurant can't contain the customers.  But it is really annoying to have to stand next to someone's table while they chow down and wait for them to be finished so you can sit down.  If you live nearby & can get your food to go, that's the ticket."}
{"text":"Craving for Hawaiian BBQ had me make a quick stop to pick up a mixed plate. Waited for about 15 minutes and could hear the meat sizzling behind the counter.
The plate consisted of 2 pieces of chicken, good amount of beef and one big piece of kalbi short ribs. It came with 2 scoops of rice and a separate container of macaroni salad.
It was grilled to perfection and tasted onolicious! Definitely better choice than the chicken katsu I've ordered before.
Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food.  Simple and satisfying.  The service here is pretty straight forward.  Order and sit.  Very clean.  The chicken Katsu is always hot crispy just the way I like it.  I tried the new ramen burger meal which is all the craze these days, and I must say..  It's good and def a foodie must try, but I probably won't order it again.  There's way better choices on their menu that I just cannot pass up.  
Eat greedy, yours truly -Mizz Loveli"}
{"text":"BBQ mix (beef, chicken, short ribs)... Good.  Chicken Katsu... Good.  Fried Shrimp... Good.  Spam Musubi... Good.  Everything I've ever ordered was good.  What else can I say?  This place is good.  There's nothing super special about it, but there's nothing bad about it.  Honest people making good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Came in at 9:20pm and as soon as we walked in the manager told us take out only!  I asked why when it clearly states on the door they don't close until 10:00.  He told me it's because he wanted to get out early.  WHAT THE FUCK?!?  I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.  So rude.  He even chuckled as he said it.  Going to call the owner tomorrow, but honestly if he hired someone like this to manage his restaurant I'd be surprised if he even cared."}
{"text":"The food is great and always tastes good. But when you have to wait 20 minutes for it is is beyond frustrating. Understaffed? Or just slow? Either way I will be avoiding this L&L from now on."}
{"text":"A 3/5 is a fair rating for this L&L. The Korean BBQ food was average. It's located in a rundown strip mall with some vagrants nearby. The chairs had sticky backs and could use a wipe down and graffiti in the bathrooms"}
{"text":"The BBQ mix is one of my favorites things to eat around. The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is I feel a little bit nickle and dimed when it comes to getting a side of sauce. They charge 50 cents per side of sauce."}
{"text":"Not only was the girl who took my order rude, she also proceeded to talk rudely about me to the cook behind the counter. After I got my food it wasn't even made right. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Actual islanders cooking in back :)  The lady up front is so sweet!  They seem to have a lot more on their menu then what other L&L bbqs have here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am sooo happy to have found them! I have eaten there probably once at week since I discovered them about a month ago. Everything I've tried has been delicious, freshly prepared and very, very good. It's in an old diner, so not fancy but it is neat and clean."}
{"text":"Hawaiian food is always a hit or miss but this place is neither. 

My boyfriend ordered the combination plate of chicken and short ribs. They were honestly okay. The chicken was a lot of breading and barely any chicken. 

I ordered the Portuguese sausage with egg and rice. It was not Portuguese sausage.. Or maybe it was a very cheap version of it. It was in the shape of spam and had just the taste changed a little. It only came with a few pieces. This was not worth $7 at all. 

Pass."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today (me and hubby) placed our order for two meals. Called up our number to pick up food... The lady only completed one order :((  Asked her where the other order was she did not understand  MAJOR LANGUAGE BARRIER.... The establishment did not seem very clean.. Will not return."}
{"text":"Super bomb! Just moved out here from Cali, the white girl cashier Gabbi helped me with my order! My new lunch spot fosho!!"}
{"text":"Been going here forever since I moved here 10 years ago. Well today I came here and left and now at Kahuku. Arrived there the guy in the front said I will be right with you. I was fine. But 10 minutes later still standing there like an idiot as he packs everyone's food and talks with his friends. So I left with my family. What happened to the other two that use to work there? This guy just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got food poisoning the very next day smh, their foods don't look too promising"}
{"text":"Iam a regular at this new location and will no longer be eating here again. Gabby the cashier so rudley greated me and got my order wrong after calling me \"retarded\" I have a service dog she might not have seen, so you can see how offended iam by this. Too bad because this was actually my favorite place."}
{"text":"The service here is sort of weird! The worker here did not seem friendly, but that's fine I just came here for some Hawaiian food. 

This chain satisfies my cravings for my usual order: 
*BBQ Mix*: beef, chicken, and short ribs.. so much food along with the rice and mac salad it comes with! Savory goodness in every bite. =] 

Overall, when in the area of South Las Vegas right in the area of the outlets.. this L&L's is blah for service, but still delicious for the hungry!"}
{"text":"SUPER FAST!! I just looked at my receipt and it says said I ordered at 3:59 and I just got my food at 4:06!!! I really recommend this place it's some good food everyone is super cool!! I think they're all from Hawaii lol"}
{"text":"I just love this place I never had a problem they are quick and the food is really good"}
{"text":"Whenever my ex-roommate's bro come into town before heading down to SD, I can always count on a delicious trip here.  -:)  He doesn't have one in Montana so it's a must whenever he comes through!

This location is a pretty good one and most of the time I go there I order the curry katsu chicken - and when I remember I order the curry sauce on the side.  This is to keep the chicken crisp.  Sometimes I forget.  D:-

The spam musubi is also delicious here.  *_*  But I love spam.  And seaweed.  And rice.  And mmm.

Orders come up fairly fast and they're nice about cups for water - some places give you that, \"Oh, you're THAT person\" look when you ask for a cup of water.  Not here.  I just simply prefer water to bubbly sugar drinks.

At some point, I must try the loco moco.  -:3"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Hawaiian BBQ I've ever had. As much as I miss my local food I'd rather not eat it than eat here. I've had several dishes prepared by this particular location. The katsu curry, Spam musubi, BBQ chicken and Kalua pork and cabbage. The curry for the katsu was disgusting. It was powdery and had no remnants of the correct flavor profile a katsu curry should have. The spam musubi was good. The sauce was good so that's really the main thing I judge. The BBQ chicken was pitiful. I've had much better BBQ chicken. This piece was just thrown on the grill for 5 min and slapped on a plate. The Kailua pork is something I judge harshly. It's been my favorite food since I can remember. It was bearable but I will never order it again. It didn't have the right smoky flavor, was mushy and pink somehow and the cabbage was crunchy and pitiful. The macaroni salad was okay and the only thing that has a chance. There are way better options to get good local Hawaiian food. And this place is not one of them. Really all they need to do is fix their recipes. They are nice and the establishment is clean."}
{"text":"This place is an icon.  If you have ever eaten here, you'll know what I mean.  There is nothing like it. Nothing comes close. Its fairly inexpensive, fast, and the employees are top notch.  They chat you up, give you extra of everything, all with a smile.

The food is spectacular. Nay, stupendous! You get all of your bodily needs at one place. Protein, Fat, Carbs, Fat, and Fat. Be warned, owner of a failing heart, this food is not for you. Go eat some cardboard and take a statin. The rest of us healthy folk will eat extra for you.

I will start my list with the macaroni salad. What's that you say? You don't believe mac salad could be \"That good\"??? Blaspheme! No Macaroni for you! Seriously, this stuff is so good, they could open a shop that serves ONLY this salad! Granted it has globs of heavy mayo, but sometimes its fun to splurge.

The Short Ribs are next and I can't eat enough of these.  Thin slices of these things cooked to perfection. No, they don't fall off the bones like BBQ ribs.  They are not slow cooked.  They're cooked more like a steak, so you have some tangibility. Some... consistency to the meat.  Chewy and yummo, I tell you. Chewy and yummo.

Chicken Katsu. Oh Em Gee, the Chicken Katsu.  Its like breaded chicken goodness. And you know they use the worst part of the chicken because its juicy and greasy and dark coated with golden crumbs and served piping hot. There's a huge vat of Katsu sauce which is likened to a sweeter sweet and sour.

All meat is served on top of cabbage leaves which is a great finish to a huge meal.  They also have surf and turf combos, but I recommend going with the Short Ribs or the Chxn.  The Mahi is good, but overpriced for the amount you get.

Oh and they have Manapua and Spam sushi too if you are a TRUE connoisseur.

When you're done eating, you can go across the street where a doctor can give you an angioplasty."}
{"text":"If I didn't like L&L in Hawaii, there's no chance I'm going to like them here in Nevada.

Ordered the breakfast place, the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice. Portuguese sausage? Uhm, more like luncheon meat from a can. Seriously! The eggs were still white, yup white!! Raw. I asked for over medium, it was not even over easy. Just raw. The rice...well it was hard.

Would not go back to this place at all, unless someone will be paying for my lunch and my hospital bill if I got salmonella."}
{"text":"Good food but as far as service goes I have received better service at a McDonalds drive thru.

Everytime I have been to this location regardless if it's been dine in or pick up the cashiers just seem so miserable. The wait time on our orders are sometimes ridiculous like today 10 minutes for a Spam Musubi. 

We go for the food not for the service"}
{"text":"I only come here because there's no other L&L locations that are around me, but it's a pain to get an order in here. Whenever I call, it either takes a long ass time for anyone to pick up or sometimes they don't pick up at all. And there's hardly any rush. And when we get there it's empty and no one is at the front. The guy and girl who should be at the counter are always hiding out in the back while the chef is just right there cleaning. The food is great but honestly the customer service is severely lacking."}
{"text":"This was the worse L&L I ever been....no say you one Hawaiian restaurant....Shame!  Worse customer service EVER!  We were the only ones in the place and the guy couldn't even walk his but over to the table.  HORIBLE...if I could leave no stars I would!"}
{"text":"It's an L&L, need I say anymore? This one is the same as any other locations, with the addition of some shady characters that hang around outside sometimes. The food is cooked to order because it takes a while to get your food. You get big portions for the price here, but I just wish the garlic chicken had more garlic flavor. Most bites just tasted like normal BBQ chicken to me since there was no flavor at all. The chicken was tender and well cooked though. I would come back if I was in the area which is one I tend to try to avoid for obvious reasons"}
{"text":"note that the 2star rating is just compared to all resturaunts not just hawaiin ones. 
food was good. i dont know my way around hawaiin cuisine so who knows? i just know it tasted good but left me with a fast food feeling afterwards. 
 atmosphere was like.. nah just do take out. the atmosphere is like an uncomfy mcdonalds made of fake bamboo with pictures of kids in bikinis. srsly kinda creepy."}
{"text":"Big portions and delicious fresh food! Their macaroni salad is simply to die for. Never had such delicious macaroni salad like this in my life. I say try it out and you won't regret it.
Ordered the chicken katsu , teriyaki chicken with white rice.
Amazing and filling .
Will be back again"}
{"text":"I've been getting the Teriyaki Chicken Musubis and OMG.. it's DELISH!!! Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"OK, but certainly not great. It is what it's supposed to be, a Hawaiian lunch joint.

I couldn't complain about my lau lau, then again, lau lau doesn't get much better or much worse. The macaroni salad was really good. One guy I went with enjoyed his BBQ beef. The other ordered a hamburger, and it looked like a pre-formed frozen patty, but I'm not sure. I love loco moco, but I don't think I would order it there.

When we went, it was probably about 50 degrees outside, and it couldn't have been more than 60 inside. Not sure if they were having problems with their heat, or if it's always like that, but it wasn't comfortable."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not as good as Hawaii, reasonable price, it's clean inside. Employees are nice, large menu, I normally get the bbq chicken and a side, mostly eat there."}
{"text":"Great food with amazing prices. I love their spam musubi and chicken katsuya. I recommend their food to all my friends and family. It's huge portions of food so prepare to be very full after eating"}
{"text":"Not a fan. This was my first visit to this L&L, but my second overall in the valley. I'm just not a fan. We went on a Saturday morning for breakfast and as we were ordering, I'm not sure if the cashier was new, or just had no clue.  I asked for the sausage, eggs, and rice which is listed on the menu as a side dish, and she looked at me like I was speaking Swahili. Umm, right there, side dish, sausage. eggs. rice. pretty please?  Still had no clue...put something into the register. My bf then ordered spam musabi, and the spam, egg, and rice \"side dish\".  Again, confused look and we had to point at what we were talking about. She put that into the register. The total was $8.95 with two drinks.  When I looked at the receipt, I noticed only his dish was on there.  HELLLOOO SUNSHINE????   It's a simple task paying attention when people are ordering their food.  They fixed the issue, apologized profusely, and we had our food in about 5 minutes. The table we sat down at, I noticed was, as other posters described, grimy. Almost like the grease was never properly cleaned on the table and left a dried greasy residue. It was vile.  My forearm kept sticking...like it was rested on candle wax.  It was gross. Ok, this is kind of a quick serve outlet, and there are no white linens, I get that, but basic cleanliness is a must if I go back. I drive past this place daily, and sometimes I want something quick...i'll continue driving."}
{"text":"I have never been to this location before but honestly by far it my favorite. I have been to three other locations across the valley. The thing that stands out is the interior design, local radio music station on, and just the OVERALL relaxing chill atmosphere. The fact since brand new new not taking over previous establishment. The minute walk in telling everything is new, super clean, and good vibes. 

The food feel every L&L visited been consistent with some of the best local food in Vegas. One that if went to L&L back in Hawaii never know Vegas or Hawaii. I ordered the loco moco and couple spam musubi. The local moco was amazing. Rice, Hamburger, Fried Egg, and the brown gravy (the brown gravy the key in my mind hit or miss loco moco). Everything was on point! Hamburger cooked perfect, over easy egg with egg yolk porn, and the brown gravy not dark brown gravy little lighter side but so much flavor. The portion size nice and generous local style.

The interior design the thing stands out is the vibrant colors they have on the walls. Very tropical and bright colors. They have all these coconut trees or look like palm trees artwork random spots along the walls. The tables and chairs super nice. None of these things found at other locations. The other locations for the most part all the same interior look not that unexpected since it is franchise. I just like the fact this one stands out and put it this way this is one that would enjoy eating my food there then take out."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of nights ago, order the basic teri-beef plate to go.  Had the runs all night.  I really hate it when Vietnamese try to be other nationalities that they are not.  You not Hawaiian so don't try to push it off on customers that you are.  Your food is so plain jane it actually sucks.  Don't try to sell tilapia as mahi-mahi, Hawaiians know the difference in fish taste, texture, and looks.  We been fisherman for hundred of years so no fake us.  Haven't had any good experience at his or other L&L shops, in other words they all suck.  In fact a lot of the Hawaiian restaurants are going downhill because of the lack of good home style cooking."}
{"text":"This is one of the better L & L's I've been to.

The chicken katsu was like they make it in Hawaii.  The katsu sauce was a bit watery.  

They serve the mac salad in a plastic side cup.  At first I was like \"WTH?\" but then after I was eating it, I realized the cup was actually a good size.  I LOVE mac salad.

Check out my pic of the sides.  Since when is one piece of portuguese sausage 99 cents?  Steep!"}
{"text":"Love their beach theme design, the best. Food is pretty good.  Open pretty early on a Saturday and my order was hot and ready quick. Big menu. Big seating area and peaceful environment."}
{"text":"Worst Hawaiian BBQ I have had.  Very large portions but not worth eating.  Chicken Katsu was soggy - exterior was not crispy as it should be and the chicken quality was poor.  Kalua pig was dry and pretty tasteless. Quality of the meat was better tho.  Spent over $40 and threw most of it away - still hungry."}
{"text":"We ordered the BBQ mix plate lunch, Seafood Combo plate lunch (with bbq chicken), vegetable fried saimin, pork pot stickers, and chicken lumpia. Our to go order took about 15 min. Not too bad considering the size of my order and the number of customers ahead of me. The gal taking orders was very sweet. 

Mostly everything was flavorful, plentiful, and truly satisfying. However, the mahi mahi in the Seafood Combo plate lunch was very very thin and the chicken lumpia was small and way overpriced ($4.99).

We will definitely eat there more often."}
{"text":"I frequent L&L despite how nasty it is. Sometimes I'll order two sides of mac salad even though it has skin and tastes like plastic. I love kastu musubis even though the seaweed is like nylon string instead of that pleasant snap. I kind of care that it's run by young people who aren't especially concerned with customer service or my well-being. I usually take my food home cover it in sriracha and furikake. I should stop coming here. I think I'm making a break through."}
{"text":"The staff and menu seem to change frequently but they still keep the staples consistent and keep that familiar L&L flavor."}
{"text":"I was dropping my shipment to the UPS next door and decided to have a lunch with my girl in here, the food was delicious with a very nice amount and the guy at front was funny when we talk about his tattoo. I'll definitely stop here again for the amazing short ribs"}
{"text":"I've been to many L&L's in my life and all I can really say is this location is criminal. 
1# was greeted by the most unpleasant lady
2# their chicken katsu is basically nothing but breading
3# for a whole plate of katsu they give you a tiny half filled package of katsu sauce and have the audacity of charging you just a little extra, and in a loud and rude way mind you. As if you offended them..
I could have forgiven all of the food if it wasn't for the piss poor service from that lady."}
{"text":"L&L BBQ is a great lunch time stop. Although I can't seem to ever get anything other than the chicken katsu, there's no need to get anything else. The rice is always great the macaroni salad can't be beat and the staff is always helpful. The restaurant is always kept very clean and the prices or weigh less than you'd expect for the portions you get eat here as often as you like you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place and will recommend the spicy chicken to anyone. It is one of the few healthy food places in the area and that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 best places to eat. My most favorite thing is the macaroni salad. I can eat that everyday."}
{"text":"I used to go hear alot when i lived in vegas. Good, reasonably priced food. Quick service. I love the barbeque short ribs here. Not too bad.."}
{"text":"Went to pick up some plate lunch dinners on Saturday evening.  Spoke with Will and saw his mother cooking.  He told me that they took over this franchise location about six years ago.  So I had not been back to this location for over six years -- how time flies!  The previous owners made crummy food, even though they are supposed to be cooking from tried and true, franchise recipes.  So after trying the old owners' food about three times we gave up on this location.  But this past weekend, my daughter wanted their garlic shrimp, so we order from them again.

I ordered three plates, but my order was misinterpreted and we got four plates instead.  I paid for all four since we wanted to try the food again and Will assured me that I would not be disappointed.  Their kalbi short ribs and bbq chicken was very good, and my daughter said that her garlic shrimp was also very good.  The macaroni salad was \"Hawaiian Style\" and good too.  We also had some beef teriyaki and that was mediocre at best -- the beef was too lean and tough, and the marinade was not very good.  If they soaked the beef in the kalbi sauce and made a bbq version of bulgogi, that would have been better.

Prices are on the high side; not extremely high, but high.  Plates are about $9 each and the short rib plate is like $10.

But I still give them four stars since their food is pretty good and I will be back.  Will try some other entrees the next time."}
{"text":"Eric had horrible customer service. I walked in and he shouted across the lobby \"for here or to go\", then rushed me to place my order. Won't be returning. I don't appreciate it"}
{"text":"Delicious Hawaiian food! I cannot begin to express how overjoyed I was to see L & L in Las Vegas when I first moved here 7 years ago. It nearly had me in tears! I knew in that moment that I'd be just fine on this hot and skin-ashing dry \"ninth island.\" 

All the \"local\" favorites from back home are on the menu. To include; manapua, musubi kalbi, laulau, Kalua pig, haupia and even Hawaiian Sun drinks. Not just Orange Passion either! They've got the works! 

The food is plentiful and mouth watering. It is just as you'd expect it to be if you were back on the islands. 

It is reasonably priced and made quick to order. I ordered the typical Hawaiian breakfast; eggs, rice and spam. One for my kidlet and one for me with an extra egg thrown in. I also ordered two regular sized drinks. As you'll see from the pics...we ate every last morsel! My total bill was just under $20.00 and worth every penny. 

The restaurant itself on Maryland and Sahara is easy to find, clean and the decor is, well...expected lol. The woman behind the counter was kind, but I've never ate in at an L&L in Las Vegas in which they didn't bring your food to your table. She called out for me to pickup my order when it was ready and that was just...unexpected. 

Normally, I frequent the L&L on Maryland and Flamingo, but they were closed for renovations."}
{"text":"Been eating here as long as I have lived in the valley, and quality has not gone down. The food is still as good as it was when I was a kid. I recommend the BBQ chicken and chicken katsu."}
{"text":"They take forever and I think I heard one the employees say a racial slur. I am black so you can imagine how upset I was."}
{"text":"Super yummy! We had chicken Katsu with French fries, spicy chicken, kalbi and spicy beef. Everything was so good. They are very generous with their portions. Super friendly and kind. They gave us a dozen malasadas they were bomb!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of an L and L Hawaiian Barbeque and now I have one right around the corner! :)  Order the chicken katsu and you won't go wrong!  Tonight I picked up some BBQ chicken, chicken katsu and some spam musubi.

Typical order right?

Hope this location does great!  Same great food!"}
{"text":"Every time I think about this place it makes me cringe!

Atmosphere
This place is a nasty grease hole. Absolutely GROSS!

Menu
They offer local Hawaii food

Food
When they first opened I would go there to get the lau lau and kalua cabbage plate.  It was pretty good.  As time went by they hired Chinese cooks and that place went down the shitter. My kalua cabbage was fatty and they chopped the cabbage up like slaw and stir  fried it with tons of oil.  I was PISSED! I also ordered the lau lau which was dried out the luau leaf tasted bitter. I'd rather not go on about this place because it only makes me upset.

BOO! This place is a NO GO!"}
{"text":"Mahi mahi on a bed of raw cabbage, brown rice and a spinach, arugula salad. My new spot."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food is so fatty and everything but the meat lacks flavor, and the meat is overseasoned!  Too salty!

Worst problem though is that the two times I walked in there I felt totally unwelcomed by the staff.  I know I'm a pale white guy, but your business is in Summerlin, not Waikiki. 

I will oblige your unwelcoming attitude by not returning. Ok?"}
{"text":"Maybe if you are Irish, you don't understand Hawaiian food.  This is NOT American BBQ.  There is no tomato based BBQ sauce.  L & L serves Hawaiian Plate Lunches -- plenty meat, two scoops rice, mac salad.  This is a classic combination for anyone from the islands.  I am so glad that they are here.  When I need some Kalbi (Korean soy marinaded short ribs) or some Mahimahi or some Teri Chicken, I know I can get some here.  Not great Hawaiian Regional Cuisine, but solid Plate Lunch food.  ONO!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to L&L to try Loco Moco with my son, it was pretty good. It would have been nice if they turned up the A/C a little bit but other then that it was a nice place to have Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"Ouch! I ordered 2 BBQ mixed Togo today and it came with a sharp piece of their scrubbing mesh. Gross! My on was the One that spotted it.  Please be careful."}
{"text":"I should have not eaten here after I smelled inside. Gross. Got sick that night vomiting every 30 min."}
{"text":"Ordered from here several times, but that's because it's close to my work and our house. The only thing that I'd crave from here would be the fried shrimp. I tried to order this again but made a mistake and ended up getting the tempura. 

The spam musubi the kids didn't like- they prefer Komex
Chicken Katsu w/ macaroni - they prefer Plumeria
Saimin- tasted like the ramen noodles you get from the store, the only difference is the meat. 

It'll do if Plumeria is closed and we don't feel like driving all the way to Decatur to order from Komex."}
{"text":"First time here. My initial impression is that this place is really really dirty. Every single table had left over food from previous patrons. 
Young man at the register is incredibly rude. I asked for sauce and he just hands it to me and turns around to continue his conversation with the cook. I said thank you and he didn't acknowledge me. 
Food ordered was unavailable, they substituted it with another item. That's fine. However, it was assumed I wanted white rice and macaroni salad. I asked later about it and he sighs and tells me it's extra for brown rice and salad instead of macaroni. Although, I heard him giving others after me the option, and the menu states you have a choice with no other explanation of price difference. Honestly, I would have even paid the extra (if it even is extra) but I wasn't given the option. 
Food is good but customer service is lacking something serious. A simple thank you goes a long way. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food and the best L&L location in town. The Bbq beef is good and so is the mac salad. The food is always made fresh. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"First we called 9 times for take out and no answer one of those times I rang over 20 times someone answered and immediately hung up. So we go there and order it took me three times to order before the girl got it right. So we wait finally get our food and go home to eat well the katsu is so overdone not even my dog wanted it. The saimin was hot but tasteless. The spam musubi is meh. The rice was perfect sticky rice! So it will be a very long time if ever that we go there again they are not local in taste or sprit"}
{"text":"I am from Virginia and my hubby is from the West Coast, so every time we travel to see his family and friends I am always excited to eat out. There are so many good food places on the West Coast that we just don't have back home....L&L being one of them.

In June we were in town and decided to get lunch/brunch.  This location was very clean and could tell that it's well taken care of. A clean restaurant reassures me that my food is trustworthy to eat! Haha. We were also greeted upon entering and for me that's always another plus for great customer service.

My hubby and I shared an order of the chicken katsu meal with rice and maccoroni salad and two spam musubis. The portions are big enough that one meal can be shared between two people if desired. Love everything about this place! Wish they had it back home in Virginia!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this place.  So tell my why she calls me up to pick up my food when every other customer in here got there plates walked over to their table.  I jus don't get it.  RACIST! And my burger was shitty!"}
{"text":"Yay! Finally a Hawaiian BBQ place closer to where I live. I hated driving so far just to get some from Maui Rose on Tropicana. 

Apparently this place had been under construction and is now RE-OPEN. The restaurant is huge and roomy with the old American diner look. You have the option of sitting by the counter on stools or in the little booths with the cushion chairs! There was AC too so I felt supeeer comfy. 

The menu they have offer a lot of things that typical hawaiian bbq places do, from the BBQ combination platter, spam musubi, BBQ burger, etc. They also offer a \"Atkins\" menu for low carb eaters, and a section if you would like to switch out for brown rice instead. They have 2 sizes in which you can order, the \"mini\" or the \"regular\". The mini comes with only one scoop of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad, the regular comes with 2 scoops of rice and 2 scoops of macaroni salad. *this is what the cashier told me so correct me if I'm wrong!*

I ordered the BBQ combination plate which has the BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, and short ribs, the bf ordered the BBQ burger and spam musubi. We decided to eat at the restaurant so we could enjoy the AC and comfy chairs.

The tables have sriracha, and aloha brand Hawaiian soy sauce, yum! Our order came and I was surprised that the food still came in a styrofoam box even though we ordered to dine in, but oh well, it will be easier to take home leftovers. My food was delicious, so much meat and my macaroni salad was good also. I think my favorite was the BBQ beef, they were yummy and thin and flavorful, reminds me of the steak or brisket you get from pho haha.

My bf enjoyed his BBQ burger but enjoyed his spam musubi way more, he enjoyed it so much he tells me to make some so he can take to work now. Great, now I need to find a musubi mold and Hawaiian soy sauce. 

Service was good, though the cashier girl could smile a bit more or be a bit more cheerful? The gentleman was nice enough to give me a free refill, so woop woop! This place is going in my bookmarks so I can definitely come back here again. :)"}
{"text":"Kind of a strange spot. Food was decent and priced pretty low. The diner atmosphere makes me wish a diner still existed. There wasn't a full menu online so couldn't call in. Hopefully my pictures of the menu are good enough."}
{"text":"This place is good! It's my first time trying it and I would say I am coming back! I got the BBQ mix plate mini that comes with rice, a bed of cabbage and macaroni salad. It reminds me of Korean kalbi, teriyaki chicken and bulgoulgi! Try it! I also got the spam masubi as a snack too and it was simple yet heavenly!"}
{"text":"I went here today for dinner because I was across the street at Costco. I totally forgot this place opened up (and so very glad it did) because the only other one I know of is near UNLV---across town for me.

The bento box was really goood. It came with four different kinds of meat, rice, and macaroni salad. All the meats were delicious, even the fried stuff wasn't very greasy. I did not try the macaroni salad --- I dislike items that taste like mayonnaise (IMHO). Thankfully, they kept the mac salad in a separate container so that it would not touch any of the food that I actually wanted to eat. This will def be my go-to here.

The seafood platter, which included scallops, mahi mahi, fried shrimp, rice, and mac salad, was alright. It didn't come with as much food as the bento combo, but it was the same price. You always have to pay more for seafood though. The scallops tasted soft with a nice, crispy breading. I liked the mahi-mahi too--very fresh tasting. I did not taste the shrimp.

PROS:
-Refillable drinks
-Plenty of seats (for a small place), some booths too
-Food was served quickly
-Good service overall
-Food comes in to-go boxes (but not biodegradable ones)

The one aspect of the visit that I disliked was that that they did not close the door even though it was windy outside. I was sitting by the door and got chills every so often. I got over it as the wind died down though.

I'll be back... I need to try their spam musubi and saimin."}
{"text":"The food is the same as every other L&L Hawaiian Barbecue location, so it's good and fresh.  This one star rating is for this location specifically.  

I've encountered them turning off their phone and closing down earlier than operating hours twice now.  And I don't mean ten or fifteen minutes early. 

Service was okay. 

Won't be back a third time."}
{"text":"This place is a shame. I grew up eating l&l and I especially loved their cheeseburgers and bbq mix plates. However, this place has no knowledge of the power of customer service. I asked a simple question weather or not I could order no rice and instead receive some type of vegetable. And she straight up look me in the eye and said \"no\" then smiled. She's lucky my hungry elderly grandparents were with me or else she would not have made a penny off of me. I hesitantly ordered a bbq mix plate no rice or Mac salad, a bbq chicken plate no rice or Mac salad and a seafood mix plate.

I open my plate and I have a bbq mix plate with 3, THREE scoops of Mac salad. Not to mention there Mac salad sucks! What a waste of Mac salad. 

I open the bbq chicken plate. Three scoops of Mac salad (eyeroll) come on lady! Listen!! 

So I proceed to try the Mac salad (even though I'm on a low car diet) and it taste like I'm eating mayo out of a jar. Yea that's how bad it was. I try a bite of the bbq beef. Taste like they poured the whole jar of shoyu to marinate it with. The food was horrible. It was just salty. The chicken was salty. Kalbi.. guess what? Salty...like raise your blood pressure salty.

Tried a piece of the chicken Katsu from the seafood mix plate. Tasted like oil. 

This place has zero customer service and horrible food. Seriously you are better off eating somewhere else. I can guarantee it. 

Even though I live right down the street, I will never go back there!"}
{"text":"Bombest l&l spot in Vegas. Great customer service. The cashier was super nice, never had any problems. Would most def come here again. Thanks GABi!"}
{"text":"Food prices are cheap and the amount of food they give you is generous, but that's where it stops. The barbecue chicken was off big time , definitely need to marinate it way more.Customer service is whatever. I won't come back"}
{"text":"This is not the L&L food that you would get in Hawaii. Food had zero flavor. Was looking forward to the gravy fries but was so disappointed that the fries weren't salted and also the gravy was bland. Shrimp curry was the worst I've ever had. The shrimp had a mushy outer coating and the curry was Indian based? Also there was so little curry that it barely covered my rice which was probably a good thing because it was green and tasted so awful."}
{"text":"I've been on a hunt for a place like this, and I finally found it! This place is AWESOME!!! They offer so many options from Spam Musubi to fresh Poke. We tried their Cheese wontons, Chicken Katsu (Came with rice & macaroni salad), Bento box (Came with rice & macaroni salad), and their Spam Musubi. SO MUCH FOOD!!!! Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but we had to try a few different things. The food is great! I highly recommend it to first timers and long time lovers of Hawaiian bbq!"}
{"text":"I prefer going to Aloha Kitchen better then L&L because the food is much better, but since this place is close to me I'll satisfy my Hawaiian food craving here. 

I usually order a regular plate w/ half BBQ chicken and half Beef. Comes with rice and some really good macaroni salad. Portions are big. The chicken taste so much better with Siracha hot sauce, so make sure you ask for some if you like spicy. 

If you're coming for lunch and don't want such a big portion, order the mini plate of BBQ chicken. It's a good lunch portion. 

If you want to try a little of everything, order the BBQ mix plate. It comes with BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, and short ribs. Come out too about $10.80 total. 

Haven't had any issues with the food or service here."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Go to Island flavor, if you want some Hawaiian food. Trust me"}
{"text":"We ordered food to go and the woman was RUDE!!Receipt says her name was Lily...We will Never go there EVER again!!!The cooks don't speak english and hollered \"No\"at us when we asked if they can give us pork instead of beef,they do not care about customer service at all!!!We left the food on the counter and canceled our credit card payment...maybe then they will listen...$$$They are all about taking our money and not delivering your food proper!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to pick up a great local meal and if your not feeling well....island grinds are da BEST!"}
{"text":"Go to any other L&L in the world, and I promise you will get better customer service and a lot better quality of food anywhere else. Being an avid L&L customer this location seems to thinks it's ok to distribute chicken katsu without the chicken. I literally received all pieces of breading. Like not even a little sliver of chicken in the middle, you bite into this and you'll have a solid crunch of straight breading. I would love to see this place boycotted or shut down so other don't have to deal with the frustration I and others have faced with just one of their dishes. This place gives Hawaiian food and all other L&Ls a really bad impression, definitely know if this was my first time it'd 100% be my last. If this franchise really cared about quality control, they'd come fix this place. Other than that, I'd advise save your money and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"So, Hawaii is amazing and the food on the islands is great. Eating at an L&L on the islands definitely has a different flavor then  eating at one here on the mainland. That being said its still pretty good.

Ultimately the Resteraunt is clean and the staff is friendly. The price of the food is truly a great deal and you can tell that love is definitely an ingredient. My only real complaint was \"fork to mouth time!\" In essence that means how long did it take to get the food to me so I can put it in my hungry growling belly! The waiting time for the dishes took to long and if you are starving don't go here for a quick fix. But if you can wait a little bit..it's worth it.

I placed my order at 12:47 pm and received it at 1:05pm"}
{"text":"My husband is from south Florida & I am from Texas so neither of us have ever tried Hawaiian food before. I've heard this was sort of a chain-type restaurant but that it was still very good so we gave it a try & were very impressed. My husband got the regular short rib plate (two scoops of rice & one scoop macaroni salad) & I got the mini chicken katsu plate (one scoop of rice & one scoop macaroni salad). Even for the mini plate, the portions were huge & I couldn't eat all of it! It's very inexpensive & very delicious. Everyone who was behind the counter was super nice & attentive. Also, I have recently tried the mochiko chicken & it's also very good. (: Tons of food for very cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is a must .they have the best chicken that I have ever tried ,i think it is much better than the raising cane's.  It is a definitely a quick and easy ,good choice for food .the workers were very friendly ,very good music"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the L&L chain plenty of times and I know what to expect. You shouldn't eat at an L&L expecting the best Hawaiian food ever. That being said, I must say that I've enjoyed this location more than most of the ones in Los Angeles. The food tastes better and it's always hot! I also had a nice conversation with an employee while waiting for my food to be cooked. I must admit that I'm glad they didn't change the building after they moved in. I like that this location looks like a diner...haha. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's good compared to other restaurants in the same category. It's not fine dining folks, get over it!"}
{"text":"Awesome location! Right by the house, super nice staff and nice selection and add on to the original L&L menu. Will most definitely come back again / order out again!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Aloha Festival this weekend and developed a craving for a Hawaiian plate lunch. After walking around with my BF and not finding anything that caught our attention, I suggested we go to L&L afterwards to eat instead. He agreed since we were heading to our friends house in East Mesa and it was on the way. 

It was the first time for me at this location and the first time for my BF at an L&L, so we were hoping it was not a let down. We were starving by this time since we skipped the food at the festival. I had been to L&Ls in Cali and Hawaii and figured they all had to be the same. I remembered that their Katsu sauce wasn't that great but nothing too bad where I wouldn't order it. 

To my surprise, this L&L was better than the ones in Cali and HI. The Katsu sauce is really good here; it's similar to the one at my favorite Hwaiian place (not an L&L) in LA that I used to frequent. I also had some of their Kalua pork and it was moist and tasty.  

I'm so glad we did not eat at the festival. We would've spent more and had to sit on the ground or stand to eat and it probbaly wouldn't have been as satisfying. 

I usually rate Hawaiian places by their Mac Salad and Chicken Katsu w Katsu sauce and this place rates high in my book. Will definitely be back for hawaiian plate lunch cravings :)"}
{"text":"Cashier with the tattoo on his right arm is a miserable human, no aloha spirit. Food is classic L&L but this guy isn't adding anything to the experience."}
{"text":"Just to be blunt, this place sucks! I've eaten plenty of Hawaiian food in my day so I can confidently say that. It's like the fast food version of Hawaiian food, cheap, convenient and fast. 

This one is located in the same plaza at the South Premium Outlets outside where all the other food establishments are. It's located next to Five Guys Burgers and Tropical Smoothie Cafe. There are only about 10 tables so seating can get limited. The restaurant was clean despite all the people that were there. I ordered my food to go since I was going to eat it at work. I noticed other people were waiting for their food as well, but I ended up getting my food before theirs. Maybe they made mine first since it was a to-go order? Who knows, but I hate when I go to a restaurant and I see other people getting their food before me when I ordered first. 

Food wise, not so good. I ordered the mini kalbi rib plate. It was a lot of food for a mini plate. It came with 3 ribs, one scoop of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. The meat was so flavorless. Good kalbi ribs don't need to be dipped in any sauce. I had to pour the sauce all over the meat for it to taste like something. The meat was super tough as well. I had to chew it for a good minute for me to be able to swallow it down. The macaroni salad had so much mayonnaise that I couldn't finish that either. 

Like I said, I got food here out of convenience. I'll just stick to Island Sushi on Eastern for my Hawaiian food cravings."}
{"text":"Food is good. I order to go probably 69% of the time and this location is prime for that logistically."}
{"text":"Been going to L&L for years.. Definitely a great place for standard Hawaiian plate lunch, with all the usual choices of Kalbi, chicken katsu, bbq chicken, etc.. 
Today was one of those days where I couldn't decide what to eat for lunch and L&L was definitely a great choice for the affordable, large quantity, and quick type of meal. 
I got my usual 2 plate mix with chicken cutlet with gravy and katsu sauce on the side, a kalua pork with cabbage, and a Portuguese sausage musubi. 
There is always a wait during the lunch and early dinner hour but if you call first to order your meal it helps with the wait. 
I'll definitely be going back to an L&L wherever they are, cause they all kinda taste the same which is good for having a familiar hearty and full meal:)"}
{"text":"Im an islander and this place holds up. Almost feel like Im back at home. Misubi was good, and I also had their cheeseburger. Had a taste of the husband's Loco Moco. It didnt take long to order and get the food. They're pretty good if you want something that tastes homemade. Ate there last weekend too but their Mahi Mahi burger was a bit on the salty scale. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu. :)"}
{"text":"We're never disappointed with the service or food quality and portion. They're consistent with food and service. Always friendly! Food is fast! Cashier is a really nice guy."}
{"text":"Been eating L&L since I was a kid in Hawaii. Had garlic shrimp and it was ok. Shrimp were battered with garlic sauce drizzled on top. Mac salad always on point and many varieties of Hawaiian suns, Aloha"}
{"text":"Was excited when this place opened up by work. I finally can have those yummy spam musubis for lunch every day! If spam and rice rolled in seaweed isn't your thing, they have many other items to try. 

Love their barbecued short ribs which tastes like korean short ribs and the kahlua pork and cabbage. I love fat! Nom nom nom. They also have somewhat healthier plate lunches like the mahi-mahi with salad and brown rice. Just make sure to say \"healthy.\" Otherwise, you're gonna get your meal with some macaroni salad and steamed white rice. But if you're really into hawaiian food, you'd probably rather die happy from a massive coronary.

The portions are really good even for the mini size and the service is friendly and fast. Check it! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"its was decent food.  Cant go wrong with rice and fried food.  only down fall is that there was a catered party that was ordered and the estimated 5 mins turned into 25 mins.  Good thing we ordered it Togo and was there before the flood gates opened.  This place gets pretty busy...


Food Quality is good, Seemed fresh and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My daughter discovered Musubi while in Hawaii last month. It was love at first bite! Didn't even realize that there was an L&L right down the street back home. Imagine her surprise when I brought her here for a treat! She says the Spam Musubi here is even better than the L&L in Hawaii!!! A huge smile for $2.25! What more can you ask for? But...when she went back for a second musubi the seaweed was a bit tough:( The fried shrimp was good not great. All in all a good value. There was no unpleasant smell when we were there but all I can say is...spam;)"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN !!!! I'm a customer for several years, and went there today for take-out.
The lady gave me 3 packets of Soy sauce n when I asked if I can get 3-4 more (ordered 4 combination dishes) she refused!! really??? I'm spending over $35 and I can't get more soy sauce?? CHEAP !!! The don't deserve my business anymore.
And the highlight was that most of our BBQ chicken was hard and burned. I heard they have changed management recently, I guess the new mangers needs to learn what customer service is."}
{"text":"I love the L&L Hawaiian Barbecue franchise but I will not be going back to this location. Been there twice, first time was on the grand opening.  That day I wasn't too sure if it was ready to open. I chose to dine in, so we grab a booth and waited for our food. The food portion that day was okay, I've has bigger portions at other locations in the valley,not to mention they ran out of rice, which IS the main staple of hawaiian food. They ran out of rice at 11:30 am, and we were one of three customers in the restaurant at the time. And Renovation was still going on as we sat in our booths and ate. Given the benefit of the doubt, I returned for a second time. This time as a take out order on my way to work. I ordered the chicken katsu plate. The chicken katsu looked great however when I took it in my car and opened it, I found that there wasn't any rice. It was green salad. Took it back inside and told them that I didn't order green salad, I ordered the rice. They told me they ran out. Yet instead of giving me an option to get something else or to choose, the took it upon themselves to give me the salad. After the discussion, I didn't make a stink of it. I just took my food and vowed to never eat there again. I just hope they get it together, or it'll hurt the brand."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not the biggest fan of Hawaiian food.  They have these places all over town.  One day I went and ordered something and didn't like it.  I think I didn't like so much that I blocked out what I had from my mind.  Let's fast forward a couple years.  One of my coworker's always went and got food from L&L and it looked good.  So one weekend my wife and were out running errands and I suggested this place.  I ordered the garlic chicken special and my wife got the bar b que beef.  The garlic chicken special was amazing.  They must put some sort of magic on it in the back.  I had dreams about this chicken for weeks.  Every once and while I have to get my \"fix\" here!  L&L is the place to go.  The service is always friendly and helpful if it is your first ordering experience.  So go check this joint out! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"What differences a day makes.....well, at least what a differences new management makes. 

When I heard L&L had a change, I had to check this out myself.   At one point this past couple of years, I was pretty disgusted with L & L in Las Vegas, and wouldn't take a step inside of that place.    Now, I may have a change of heart.

I pulled in around 215 pm, and only seen one person eating.    It looked like the toll of bad service and short cut hamburger steak has chased away a lot  transplanted Hawaiians from this once busiest franchise for this company.   I looked around, and the new management has cleaned up the restaurant for the better.    No longer the mickey mouse hand written specials (that you can barely read), and the cross off with tape menu board.     

I\"m still not happy with this franchise lack of \"A\" mixed plate, which is a staple in Hawaii; which consist of BBQ beef, Hamburger Steak, and Beef or Curry stew.    This causes me to write their corporate offices a few years ago, but they didn't care, and they took a huge dive in customer count for their short cuts in everything they do.    No  real Hawaiian eatery would just use a 100% frozen beef hamburger from Costco, as this place once did.    Well, it looks like they are starting to listen.

I order a Chicken cutlet plate, and it took about 5 minutes to make.    I was a beyond stunned, because their trying to get their customers back with pure volume of food.  I swear they went with four large piece of chicken, and notice they went back to the original recipe (Thank God!)       The mac salad was the  same recipe from Hawaii, and the rice...well, rice.

I'm going to check them out next week, and see if the rest  of their short coming are being improved    At this point, I\"m going to say...I'm happy with them again, but I\"m not quite  a big fan of them in Las Vegas.....YET."}
{"text":"Ordered #20, chicken cutlet with rice and gravy and it was delicious!! It was a huge portion, I shared it with my dad and brother. I also ordered banana lumpia which was a first for me, I loved it!!"}
{"text":"4 stars.

Tried this place today for the first time. I gotta say I really enjoyed it! 

This location is right next to the Wienerschnitzel on Serene, roadside in front of Home Depot and WalMart.

Service was friendly and there was just a 5 minute wait as they cooked the food. I got the BBQ chicken bowl(4.95) while my friend got the Chicken Katsu bowl (also 4.95). We both agreed that mine was the better of the two, but for 5 bucks a bowl, you can't go wrong!


I'm looking forward to coming back and trying out other things on the menu, and its so close to the house so I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"L&L is not my first choice for hawaiian but not much available on this show of Town. The Loco Moco was decent. Gravy was a little too canned/jar type but the eggs were cooked well.  The mixed plate was pretty good. Chicken was a little over cooked.  Very generic Hawaiian food. Won't speak much about service since I didn't dine in."}
{"text":"3/28/18 
Yup, 4 stars!! So far L and L hasn't disappoint me. C'mon,  you can't go wrong with chicken katsu curry or by itself. Well, we just got back from Oregon and decided to stop over since it was already dinner time. My husband and I shared a chicken katsu curry and his kids got a chicken katsu and a loco moco plate. Heard no complaints about the food unless itbtasted really good cause they were hungry and for some strange reason the macaroni salad was just enough mayo and not too much. Actually, from what i remember it tasted better than Hawaii's mac salad...lol...i deducted a star cause i haven't tried anything else on the menu yet. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's the Olive Garden of Hawaiian food.  There are better Hawaiian joints in North Las Vegas and Henderson, but if you're desperate and want an okay plate, L&L will do.  

Otherwise, look elsewhere on yelp for better recommendations."}
{"text":"Not really impressed at all. My boyfriend and I decided to come here, we ordered spicy chicken plate, chicken Katsu, a spam musubi and a bbq chicken musubi. Nothing really has flavor. Very bland, Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We were going to grab burgers at 5 guys but smelled good food next door here. The Taste lived up to the smells. The customer service was good so the complaints from other reviews must be based on different workers. The dining room was clean but got a little messy during the lunch hour rush. The kid running the counter was running around getting things done. I couldn't ask for more for a Hawaii BBQ place."}
{"text":"Today i received some of the best customer service ever at l&l the tall cashier was very patient with my group and I even though we had some complicated orders that im sure got annoying i just thought it would be wrong not to acknowledge him so thank you for all the help"}
{"text":"I always get their garlic shrimp to go and it is always delish! Unlike other places, you don't have to peel the shrimp and it also comes with broccoli&onions. I literally ate here every Friday during lent and never got tired of it. The one time I ordered garlic shrimp from elsewhere, it made me sick. L&L is officially my go to place for that."}
{"text":"Im sure that lots of people love this place but me personally the meat is WAYYY to fatty for me"}
{"text":"My family and I have loved l&l since we first found out about them a decade ago or so. Needless to say, we have been frequent customers since then; sometimes we will eat here three times or more in a week. Anyways, it seems as though the quality of their meat has been drastically reduced since we first found out about this chain... idk about the other locations, but as for this one, the beef is nearly all fat and the chicken is almost always bloody. I love this hawaiian food but have gotten sick many times from eating at this place... The service is great, but the food is not (anymore)."}
{"text":"Good portion of food and our favorite mochiko  chicken and chicken katchu  (I am not sure how to spell it.. haha) were great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Hawaiian BBQ chicken, it was okay. The service was fast and the server was friendly. The inside seemed outdated and the walls looked dirty."}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad at this location of L&L, but I was worried about the cleanliness of the place.  Not that the cooking area was dirty, but the vents were dusty and the tables weren't cleaned right away.  The food was pretty good, something I expect from L&L, so in terms of the food, it wasn't too shabby."}
{"text":"Went to the L&L's on Fort Apache/ Russell rd. Looked at the menu and saw Beef Curry, I asked for it and the cashier said we don't make that anymore. They should have taken that item off the menu board. I thought that all L&L's have the same menu. They have it at the Flamingo/ Maryland parkway.
I guess I'll drive 10miles for a Beef Curry craving. Lol."}
{"text":"(In Mesa Grand Shopping Center on the AMC Theater side)

Like tasty meals for less than ten bucks? How about your choice of shrimp, mahi-mahi, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, chicken katsu, Korean-style shortribs, mac salad, kim-chee, passion-guava juice, saimin, or a loco moco? Think this is a mistaken post on the Phoenix Yelp and meant to be on the Honolulu, Hawaii site?

Well, think again. I couldn't believe it at first either, but L&L BBQ (or L&L Drive in as the kama'aina know it) is in AZ. Authentic Hawaiian plate lunches can be had in freaking AZ. And L&L is actually from Hawaii.

What's a plate lunch, you may ask? It's brilliant: 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of mac salad (local-style macaroni salad has basically the macaroni, mayo, and some carrot shreds and is very yum), and your choice of entree representing one of the diverse cultures of Hawaii (ie Korea, Japan, etc.) all on one plate. And never more than 10 bucks. This is food-coma inducing stuff at its best. Heavy on the carbs, calories, and yumminess. All the good things in life.

But L&L also offers brown rice and more healthful options if you choose - I think they have a grilled shrimp item as well. When I was younger, my absolute to-die-for fave was the shrimp curry plate. Hawaiian-style curry is more akin to Japanese curry, which resembles a stew more than a soup, and doesn't have the same spiciness that Thai or Indian curries do. It's very mild and oh-so-delish. 

L&L breaks my heart here because they don't offer this option, but they do have katsu curry (Japanese-style fried chicken served with the aforementioned curry on top....mwahahahahammmmm!) and enough other selections to keep me happy and coming back again and again.

It's a cafeteria-style joint, so you 'aint taking people here to impress them with tile walls and acrylic chairs. The service...hmm...the cashiers have always been very friendly and lovely every time I've been. But the time it takes to get my order from request to ready has taken nearly 20 minutes on occasion. This is the only thing that takes away that one star (I have to forgive on the shrimp curry because you really can't have it all the way you remembered it, can you?) but really...

...I would wait for the seas to part for my fix of fried shrimp, shortribs, kimchee, and rice when it tastes this much like home. 

*Added bonus is they have the Honolulu-Star newspaper for you to read while you wait from time to time. 
*You can buy Kauai Kookies by the box. These are really from Hawaii.
*They cater too. 
*I'm hungry now."}
{"text":"Why is this place empty? People come on in! I know it's on Nellis and super dupper fast street, but COME ON IN! I was skeptic of this place at first, why should I? I have never tasted Hawaiian food, plus it's fast food so even more doubt. But I went in and gave it a shot. The entrance is clean as well as the inside. I went in and had not a clue what to order. I asked the cashier, which was from the islands as well as the cook; that made me more comfortable ordering because I thought it was going to be someone else of a different ethnicity cooking the food, She recommended me a cheap and inexpensive dish to try out first. So I got that and she gave my mother and I free drinks for the wait. Which wasen't much, but ahh I can't say no...

  I got a macarroni type dish with white rice and hawaiian type pork. It wasen't sweet, or to raw of taste it was real good. The rice wasen't all dry like steamed rice it felt cooked and steamed. The macarroni was great. Oh yeah the tartar sauce was great. I would come here again when I had the chance and try new dishes, I am a fan of this fast food joint. Oh yeah I think it was a low carb dish."}
{"text":"Super slow service, but really nice people. They give you a lot of food for the price, but the quality isn't terrific.  The atmosphere is aight. It really filled me up and to be honest, I'm probably coming back. It's pretty great Hawaiian food for the desert."}
{"text":"I must admit, out of all the L&L in the valley, this location by far is the best one. Reason being is this place is clean and inviting. Another reason is their plate portion is on dot like back home. I normally order chicken katsu, and it's alot. You would think it's a regular plate.."}
{"text":"Always delicious brah. Never had a bad meal at this location. Really tasty quick Hawaiian food. Nice to call in an order and have it ready for pickup in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food and very quick service.  I love the moco loco and usually ask for extra gravy over everything and they do it right every time!"}
{"text":"Super thin pieces of bbq chicken. Worst L&L location in Vegas BY FAR. When the lady was packing it to-go, she didn't include any of the sauces they typically give or utensils or even napkins. Drive a few miles away to a different location. 1/10"}
{"text":"I go to L&L from time to time just to have something a little different. It's nothing like real Hawaiian food, but the serving portions make it tolerable.

This L&L was constructed from a former 70's Diner, so there's a old-school feeling upon entering the establishment. My last visit here was definitely not the best visit I have had.

I order the chicken katsu, which is my usual pick, my other being the loco moco. The wait was not too long and my party and I were served by the waitress/cashier. My chicken katsu came with no cabbage on the bottom and was quite dry and tasteless. It was as if there was more care put into the breading than the chicken itself. If it weren't for the sauce that accompanied the chicken katsu as well as the Sriracha, I do not think I would have been able to finish.

L&L is not a horrible place to go to, but there are a variety of other places to eat down the road if you go east on Lake Mead Blvd."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, the food here is ok. It's good enough for me to go just to satisfy my local food craving.  I usually get the garlic shrim and  my bf loves mochiko chicken and gets it all the time.  Loco moco is not the greatest but i'll eat it.  
The ppl there are friendly.  No complaints about that."}
{"text":"just showed up 30 minutes before close and the door was already locked. the guy just stared at me, change your hours if you want to close early."}
{"text":"I got the BBQ chicken plate and it was a good amount of food for the price. It all looked good when I got home and sat down to eat, but the chicken was the only thing worth eating, luckily their was 3 good size pieces of it. The 2 scoops of rice were just big clumps stuck together and the macaroni salad was pretty blah."}
{"text":"I'm normally quite pleased with this spot but tonight's Mahi Mahi fail may have a lasting effect. The fish was basically nonexistent in the extremely greasy batter. The portions are great and the food is generally very flavorful though."}
{"text":"worst service ever , I don't ever complain about anything but the lady that works here always had a disgusting attitude, my sister went to go get a combo plate and she charged her 2 spam musbi when she didn't even ask for them she took advantage that she was 12 year old girl , and she gave her a rude attiude , shame on that lady and this whole location every L&L in vegas is alright but this location don't ever come here"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The sauces compliment the combos fabulously. Much variety in meats and stuff."}
{"text":"I wouldnt even give them one star if I had a choice. We spent $75 for the cashier to be a douche. My bro inlaw asked about the seafood w meat combo because its a different number at other places. My brother asked him which plate it was since he didn't see it on the menu. The cashier looked at my brother like he was stupid sipping his drink staring at him telling him he can pick what ever he wants.
When our food was ready he called us and my brother and husband got up to get the food. While eating, we noticed he brought everyone's food to their table except ours. We bought the most food and probably spent more then everyone else. 
What bothered me the most
#1 we had 3 kids with us and they were playing music talking about f@cking. Wth? Ghetto! I thought L&L plays hawaiian music. I dont mind different music but to play explicit music in a family restaurant is unacceptable. 
#2 i dont mind that he needed a smoke break but to come back inside mid smoking to pass out food to customers not washing hands. Eww grose.  Not once but twice.
#3 again with scratching his head, not washing hands going back to hand food to customers.
#4 i think the old guys knew we were pissed cuz they made us free malasadas. The cashier brought it out to us but practically threw it at my brother saying, \"here it's free\" and walked away.

Dont think we will be going back. This guy is unsanitary with really bad customer service. By the other reviews I've read... You shouldn't go to this place either. The health district needs to check them out because they dont deserve the \"A\" they have on their wall all because of this fool. He shouldnt work customer service if hes gonna continue a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Not that great. I had the garlic shrimp plate, that was a mistake. This dish has a lot of broccoli, way too many onions and very dried out tough shrimp. Steamed rice, okay if you like steamed rice and Mongolian salad which is just warm pasta salad made with too much mayo. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"1st time and i told the guy that.  Staring at the menu , wondering what to order...he never offered any advice.  Ordered 1/2chicken gravy 1/2 Katsu.  Not memorable.  I heard they gave brown rice which I was looking forward to, but I guess you have to request it.  Poor customer service and food was just ok.  I am local and live 1/2 mile away.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was freshly made, so a little wait, but we had great company, so who cares. The food was excellent. Especially the beef. We got the family meal with 2 kinds of chicken, and the beef. Loved the macaroni salad. Rice a little dry for my taste. All the wonderful sauces they had to pour on it made up for the dryness. The cook (owner?) and girl we ordered from were amazingly friendly and kind. Thanks guys! Ate here on 7/25/10 about 7:30 pm. I could eat a whole plate of that beef all by itself! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is so good and the service is great I like how clean they keep it and I know I will have a good time coming here definitely would recommend to people and I would obviously be coming back"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to find another Hawaiian restaurant in Phoenix. Chicken katsu is good as is the mixed BBQ plate. If you crave an island style meal this is one of the few places I've found in the valley."}
{"text":"Got the bbq chicken and rice. Waited forever for our food but it taste good. We were the only customer there at the time but we waited 20 minutes. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"The food is alright for what it is. The cashier acts as if you're non-existent, she has no customer service skills. When she brought our food to the booth we were sitting in, I asked her for a straw (the top of the soda can was dirty). She went back to the soda machine area and placed the straw on the counter. My bf had to walk up and get it for me. Next time I want Hawaiian food, I will go to a different restaurant because this place makes you feel uncomfortable and unwanted."}
{"text":"We have visited this location a few times as it is right next door and very convenient. When the franchise opened I was beyond ecstatic as I fell in love with LL when I lived in Hollywood. After discovering it there I must've eaten LL once a week for a year straight. My enthusiasm was soon shot down by this place as a whole.

The inside of the diner is visually unappealing, the counter person is ALWAYS RUDE and the beef bbq is seemingly always, without fail, tough and/or chewy.

My overall opinion is if I wanted bad Hawaiian bbq with a shitty attitude I'd make it myself. 

Needless to say, I shan't be a regular."}
{"text":"We've ordered 2 dish. One is the curry and the other is the kalbi. They gave huge chunks of potato and carrot for the curry, and lots of meat for the kalbi. However, the kalbi was way too salty. Not enough rice to dilute the salt. Curry could be better. Food smells good and may fit those who have large craving and who likes salty food."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot for a good price. I like getting the chicken bowl (when feeling healthy) and the bbq mixed plate (when I'm not feeling healthy). If you get the bbq mixed plate just he mini version is plenty for one person. The staff is usually pretty on top of their stuff and this particular location has been clean every time I walked in. I love their sauce that comes with the meals!"}
{"text":"Was happy to see L&L open in a closed diner location on Buffalo & Lake Mead next to Grape Street.  I stopped by for some take out at 6pm and it was empty.  

Service was awkward.  The two cooks at the grill were staring out at me because they had nothing to do.  The lady at the counter was not very friendly.  

I ordered Chicken Katsu Curry, Chicken Cutlet with Gravy, BBQ Mixed Plate, and a side of Lumpia.  

The food was good...but I was not pleased that they would pour the gravy over the cutlets in a take out order.  I've never had to give special instructions to any restaurant to put the gravy on the side.  The cutlets were soggy when we came home.  :(

I've been to other L&L's and have had much better service.  If this is a franchised location, they need to be trained better.  If this is a corporate owned location, they need to be trained better."}
{"text":"Just opened and I'm so excited!

It is hit or miss depending on the store in the valley, but I'm glad to report that this is a good one!

Spam Musubi and a Hamburger Steak Plate Lunch were very good.

Glad there is one on the West side of town in Summerlin now.   I will definately frequent this place."}
{"text":"Finally, a Hawaiian Food place that won't break the bank!  Just opened three days ago and the food is awesome just like any other L&L.  Got the BBQ mixed plate with Brown Rice and green salad. Not disappointed at all.

Adequate seating and nice and clean location. The Lady at the register is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I often come to this side of town to visit my mom.  It pains me to know an L&L is so close but I can't ever go here again.

It's a shame, but the food here is not very impressive.  The hamburger for the hamburger steak plate lunch seems preformed and doesn't taste very good at all.  Something isn't right here and something needs to be done!  Eat an another L&L location and you'll see the difference.

This place is empty for a reason."}
{"text":"Friendly folks, good no nonsense food. Love it. L&L is franchised so I've noticed that different locations give more or less food. This location is generous with the portions and the employees are always nice."}
{"text":"I have come to the conclusion that L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is the McDonald's of Hawaiian food.

There's really nothing special about the food at all. It's not necessarily cheap and the flavor is lacking in nearly all of the different items I have tried. Often times, as is the case with the barbecue chicken and even in the spam musubi, the meat is crispy and doesn't taste very good.

Needless to say, despite the convenience of it being near my house, I will probably not be eating here again and can't recommend it to anyone. 

Aside from the establishment's food, this parking lot has to have more homeless people in it than any other lot in the city. Just a fun fact!"}
{"text":"First time customer, very good food, especially the chicken. I tried 4 different types of meat. The chicken bowl is excellent. Mei offered us the best customer service! She was insightful, kind, and patient. Checked on us several times for refills, extra to go orders, etc. Worth driving a little father to this location if need be. :)"}
{"text":"The customer service was completely terrible. I went in for my craving of some Chicken katsu and some Thai Tea but to my surprise they don't have Thai Tea but only available in the can! Their other locations have it available and made to order. Our meal was okay but lacked  memorability of any sort. And don't get me started on the lady manning the register, we came in the evening so she took our order there and I'm telling you that this women literally ruined my entire experience there. I'm never coming back to this location no matter the short drive, I rather drive 20 minutes to next closest one then to come back here."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble in here after shopping at the Premium Outlet (south of strip). This is an average run of the mill Hawaiian BBQ spot. The portion sizes were quite large and the food quality was surprisingly not bad. The only complaint about the meal was that the mac salad had a smokey taste to it... it was odd. Almost like it was prepared in a room filled with smoke or they added something to it that had that flavor. Other than that, the meals were a pretty good value (price/portion/quality)."}
{"text":"I don't really like hawai food so I don't really know if it was good or not but my chilcknen was pretty soft and stuff"}
{"text":"Call and order ahead for pickup. Food is always ready within 10/15 minutes. 

Big portions so you definitely  your money's worth.

Go to's are:

BBQ Chicken Plate
Mix BBQ Plate
Chicken Katy's
Saimin Soup

Can't go wrong with any of those. There's also lunch specials and bowls for a quick and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Jophy and all staff members thank you so much for our company lunch today! We placed our order the day before gave her the time we need it by. Everything was ready nice and hot. I have not had L&L's for a couple of years now.  It's good to know you guys are nothing but 10 minutes from us. Other Hawaiian places are pretty far from us.

Jophy&staff made sure we had extra everything plates, utensils, sauces you name it we had it all. Everyone loved today's lunch thank you and keep up the great work you all are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I think that being in the Walmart parking lot makes this place a lot more popular than the other locations. But Hey! sometimes when you gotta have Grindz you brave the line. It's par for the course L&L fare. I'm a loyal L&L patron and go to all of them in every state (CA, NV, Hawaii). My advice is call in your order 30 minutes prior."}
{"text":"We love L&l but this location does not do a good job with the food. My moms ribs were all fat, my chicken Katsu was just over cooked with no chicken in it. Now we go to the location on eastern and serene. It's great."}
{"text":"Good local food, laulau needs a little more salt or a piece of butterfish, mac salad is a little inconsistent.  Still a go to place for local food!!  Good saimin dashi!  Always nice having a fresh spam musubi!!"}
{"text":"A taste of Hawaii in my bakyahd! :) freak yea!

I don't eat land meat, but I do enjoy seafood n when I go to L&L I get the garlic shrimp or saimin noodles. 

This location batters their shrimp and serves everything in styrofoam whether you dine in or take it to-go..

My mom n brother got the short ribs and said it tasted like they dipped the ribs soy sauce. I will never know what they taste like, but I do remember what Aloha Kitchen's ribs tasted like and they were off the hook!

I give this location a 2 because I was dissapointed in the battered shrimp. At other L&L locations it came without the batter. Another reason why they get a 2 is because of KRaZie amount of styrofoam they use, the place has two tables and five booths, and the guy working the front counter seemed a little out of sorts.

Although the review could have been better, I will definitely be back. It's literally 3 minutes from my hale and better than them fast food joints."}
{"text":"I had never tried Hawaiian BBQ before coming to L&L so I'm no afficianado on the subject.  I had only recently discovered Korean BBQ (which the two are similar in style but not taste).  The menu here is very full and just delicious to even look at.  I've never found it to be too busy and I'usually get my order taken in no time.  The atmosphere is always clean and the staff is always very friendly.  There's usually two asian guys in the kitchen that you get to watch cook and seem to know their stuff because I've never had a bad experience.  I've only tried one item on the menu and thats the BBQ Mix meal but it has been consistenly amazing every time I've tried it (save the one time they forgot to give me the free eggroll but thats neither here nor there). The meat is so full of flavor and the chicken is so tender it literally will fall apart in your mouth! The plates are always full of food and full of flavor and I always leave feeling like a stuffed pig and I love that!  I would normally rate a place like this a 4-star just because its not really anything out of this world different or exotic but being as it has been 100% consistent and that means the world to me, it gets the full 5 stars! I've read some peoples reviews on how this place is nothing like the ones back in Hawaii so I can only imagine what they must be!"}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed to say that I love this restaurant. I know there are better Hawaiian spots in town but there is something consistently comforting about the numerous dishes served here. The staff is always laid back and chill and the price is always right."}
{"text":"Wow this place was ok before but now it's heading downhill...fast! 

I ordered the hamburger steak & they now use frozen patties and douse it with salty brown gravy. (maybe Chinese cooks need to stop smoking so try can actually taste their own food) My son ordered the chicken katsu & I figured they couldn't mess that up but they managed to burn some of the katsu. 

To top it off it wasn't even crowded & they still botched up the katsu.

I understand that quality control may be a problem with a franchise but this is borderline insulting to all the other L & L's. Just a little note to L & L headquarters...time to review Quality Control at this locationl!!! 

I'm no food expert but I'm originally from Hawaii so we grew up eating L & L at the Liliha location- it may not have been the prettiest place but their food is always good.

If you are looking for decent local  plate lunches...save your time & money & make the drive to Island Flavors on Durango or Island Sushi on Eastern. Trust me."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We received a coupon in the mail and I understand that not all locations accept it. However, when the way you ask a co-worker is \"Hey we don't accept this right?\" Instead of \"Do we accept this coupon?\", it's kind of rude. So to the \"person of weight\" behind the counter, brush up on your customer service skills and stop eating all the rice.

Went to this place again against better judgment. Horrible customer service as always! Some of the workers were not wearing gloves or hair nets. And the food quality has gone down. Servings are smaller and too much breading on the chicken katsu. They make a ridiculous amount of profit to begin with, now they're just being greedy. Never again..."}
{"text":"Went to this shop today 10/17. It was closed. Now they have a Modern Sushi open in the old spot. Just for the benefit of other patrons looking for it -- its now CLOSED."}
{"text":"Affordable, the atmosphere is chill, and the food is bomb! Unless there is a giant line, the wait isn't too bad either!"}
{"text":"I don't know if the L&L on Serene spoiled me or not but this location is definitely not up to par. After relocating to this side of town I was craving my half and half combo of BBQ chicken, short ribs w/ all rice. Order was made quickly, however one of my short ribs was really tough and chewy. As for the BBQ chicken it was so bland felt and tasted boiled more than BBQ. Unlikely to be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I drove by this place the other day during lunch and was in the mood for Hawaiian food, so I stopped in for a quick bite.  I wasn't all that hungry, so just ordered their BBQ chicken rice bowl.  The bowl didn't look too big, so it was kind of deceiving that there was quite a big portion of BBQ chicken and rice inside.  The chicken was flavored just right and was very tender.  For $3.99 + tax, you can't go wrong for lunch.  Stop by and try some of their wonderful cuisine."}
{"text":"Ok this place is almost as good as Hawaii's L&L's! If ever I want Chicken Katsu or Barbeque Teriyaki Plate lunch this is where I go! Staff is friendly and food is always fast! Im defintley a fan of this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.
I love the short ribs from here just appalled that my order contained what I would call scraps for the price I payed.

BBQ chicken is moist but not much BBQ flavoring.

Going to back for more short ribs and experiment with a few other items in the list, as of now im not impressed."}
{"text":"Upon entering this restaurant, the first thing I noticed were the old dirty chairs and the faded pictures in the wall. The table tops were old and dingy and the front counter was cluttered. 
I discover that a key was needed to use the restroom and that was truly a sign. The stench of the restroom was unbearable! I've never had to go to the restroom that bad.
It is unfortunate that this restaurant is so dirty, because the food was pretty good. I did, of course, take it home. 
I had chicken katsu wit rice and fries. The chicken was tender and juicy with a very tasty crunch. The rice was as good as could be expected for white rice, tender and a little sticky. The fries were decent and the sauce that came with it really bright the meal together. Overall, a good meal. 
The good meal is far shadowed by the filthy restroom and lack luster dining room. Too bad they don't have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Food is decent as usual. Just another restaurant that is suffering because of the person working the front of their business! A little customer service can go a long way. Severe lack of customer service and friendly attitude at this location. Cashier was on her cell phone when I came in, dined in, and when I left. No thank yous or your welcome while I was interacting with her. No farewell or acknowledgement after I had placed my order. This is just part of the reason they have an empty dining room on a Saturday evening. Management could step it up compared to other locations. Is it really sad to me how many restaurants fail because the cashier/host represents their business poorly."}
{"text":"Called in my order, everything looks great! I can't wait to get home and devour the food! ^_^ I called and asked some questions, even though there was a slight heavy accent barrier, the lady here was polite and got my custom order correct. I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"While not of the same quality, L&L is definitely reminiscent of the \"real\" stuff in HI and the portions are generous (see pic); if you need some Hawai'ian flavors here on the mainland, this is the place to go (although I was disappointed that there was no chicken laulau and the kalua pork was over salted)."}
{"text":"Terrible .......the cashier was clueless 5 people ahead of me with no food ......I get it we are in a predominate Hispanic area but at least know the basics know your product if your gonna be  selling it (English would be nice) I won't be back ............l&l don't think you want this caliber of service representing your name"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places when I am craving some cheap comfort food because burgers and fries aren't always going to cut it haha.

My favorite item on the menu is the chicken katsu which comes with rice and macaroni salad. The mini version is enough for two meals for me since I usually order a spam musubi and Thai tea with boba.    Getting those three items costs me about $12 which isn't too bad considering I get an appetizer, an entree, and a drink. The spam musubi is a must try item if you have never had it. I don't generally eat spam, but it is just too good with the rice, seaweed wrapping, and their sauce. The macaroni salad is also delicious! Not too creamy and has such an addicting taste. It really goes well with the crispness of the katsu and gives your tastebuds a break from the steamed rice. I have to admit that the Thai tea isn't the greatest and the boba is generally not fresh, but for $2-3 I guess I can't really complain.

Give this place a try because you might become a fan! If not, you won't be losing that much money anyways. Definitely going to come back and I have been inspired to try out other Hawaiian places!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Spam on the menu! Hawai'ian style food in a quick, clean & friendly establishment? I'm all about it! Service was quick & friendly! Establishment was clean and the food was tasty!!"}
{"text":"I usually get the BBQ chicken combo or chicken katsu but today I decided to try the chefs special, Aloha Steak and its  super delicious only $9  this might be my new fav dish from here! :)"}
{"text":"Good Hawaiian food with friendly service and enormous portions. I got the BBQ combo plate with beef, short ribs, and I substituted the BBQ chicken with chicken katsu curry. The meal was huge and everything was cooked well. After living in Hawaii for close to four years, this place brought back memories of all of the good local food you used to eat back in the day. I wish they served meat jun though."}
{"text":"Our family eats at L & L frequently and love it.  We recently had a large gathering and ordered kalua pig, teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef and the fixings. Because we ordered so much they threw in malsadas for free.  All the food was  hot and totally delicious and we had plenty of leftovers. The food was a perfect choice and a great value."}
{"text":"This place has gotten on my last nerve!! I ordered their garlic shrimp, which we all know what that should be (prawns saut√©ed in garlic and butter) however they battered the shrimp, deep fried it then tosses in garlic butter - to make it SOGGY!! So I asked why doesn't it look like the picture on the menu? She said \"ohhh no batter?\" Uh duh look at your menu. She takes it back to remake and this time .... rather than prawns I got super small (slightly bigger than bay shrimps) cooked in garlic and some butter and it was chewy!!!  I said you're out of prawns since I got this little shrimp - she said yes! Well.... don't you think you should change your menu or say something? All she did was shrug her shoulders - Really WTF!! 
I believe this place is L&L HAWAIIAN BBQ and yet not one Hawaiian working there but ALL Chinese workers that don't speak English. So annoyed and now I know why I hate ordering out"}
{"text":"This is the first time we tried Hawaiian food, and we really enjoyed it. It took us a while to decide what to eat, and they were patient with us. The portions were generous for the price. The shrimp was fresh and crispy. It was also the first time I tried spam musubi, so I was really happy with it. Wish I can get these food in Oklahoma!"}
{"text":"L&L is a good chain Hawaiian restaurant, and I have been a frequent partaker at the Summerlin location. But this location lacks in both ambience and flavor...and frankly, cleanliness. I actually got the heebie-jeebies the last time I ate there. And they got my order wrong. The interest in the architectural structure is not enough to swing your appetite this way."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant.  Was a little bit afraid after reading some of the other reviews but was in the mood for something different so decided to go ahead and try it. Ordered the BBQ beef sandwich and loved the thin slices of beef, good flavor. Ordered the egg rolls and they were nothing special,  had the kimchi and loved it, not super spicy buy spicy enough for me. A nice change of pace for a fast food need."}
{"text":"My new favorite Hawaiian place! I love how fresh quality the food taste and served with a HUGE portion! I got the mini meal with rice, kabuki, and macaroni salad and it was massive. They aren't skimpy when it comes to their meat f d that's why I'll always be returning here. I love the authentic taste and the food itself! Highly recommended coming here!! I won't try any other Hawaiian food since my search for the perfect place is found"}
{"text":"I cant believe I have driven by this place so many times and not stopped in. 
First, it used to be a diner location, so it still looks that way . I Picked up the Mahi Mahi for $10.95 and I got enough good food to last me all day. I grabbed one Katsu Musubi which with the meal was an all day serving. Service was Great. I was greeted and checkout out with a smile by a sweet women working the front. The prices for everything are good too. Next time I stop in  Im going build up the courage to try their Ramen Burger. They have enough on the menu to keep you busy, so enjoy my Hawaiian grill fanatics."}
{"text":"One the cleanliest L&L's I've ever step foot in. Staff were pretty friendly, even allowing me some substitutions no extra charge. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't left a review here yet but I've been here almost 10 times atleast. I noticed a lot of hawaiin spots here in Vegas . I guess I'm gonna have to be more critical now since there are so many locations to grub on some hawaiin foods. However this one is the first name that comes to mind when I crave chicken katsu and the loco moco."}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials here.  You get a ton of food for a cheap price.  The Chicken Katsu is THE must have if you've never tried it.  I've tried it at many places around town and I always think L & L has the best.  

Also, L & L makes a great double cheeseburger.  Since there is no Big Kahuna Burger, I like to think it probably taste like the delicious burger Jewels eats on Pulp Fiction.  

The knock on this place is it is sometimes a little dirty and there can be a sewer smell in or by the bathrooms on occasion."}
{"text":"Unless my own family is making the food, it doesnt get better then this in Phx for hawaiian bbq. i was so happy to discover the opening of the mesa location. with uncommon but tasty items such as portuguese sausage, manapua (with the sweet pork), spam musubi, malasadas and saimin... the range of menu items is extraordinary!
Each item is top notch, I have indulged in the katsu, teri chicken, lau lau, kalua pig, mac salad, spam musubi, manapua, malasadas... and this is only visiting the location twice. 
My first time at L&L was in HI when growing up, then it franchised to Portland when i was in college, now that it is in Mesa, it might become the most frequented comfort food joint in town for me. 
I will be introducing many to it, by claiming it as \"legit Hawaiian food\""}
{"text":"when you walk in the place speaks for itself. I like the Katsu Chicken. Im not pleased with most everything else."}
{"text":"Their chicken katsu your eating just breading barely any chicken in it. Their mac salad isnt put in a separate container when it's to go plus its warm n  alot of mayo nottin else..The saimin no taste plus they dont use the real thing SPAM..shitty..save your money n go else where..
My family n I threw our food away..kiss $26 in da drain..
Not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the 3 piece mix, it comes with 2 scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. It's enough food for 2 people or plenty for left overs.  Very easy on the budget. If you call ahead, they will have it waiting on you. About 11 bucks for this order. Yummy!  Staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"The spam saimin and chicken Katsuya were excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered regular BBQ Chicken.
I guess I haven't been here for a few months? 
When did this happen?

Macaroni Salad  & BBQ Chicken = 4 stars
Mini Portions of Rice = ZERO!
2 scoops  = 2 bites?

See posted pictures.
The Blade of Plastic fork is longer than the Scoop!

I thought of ordering extra rice but at 90cts/scoop? 
OMG that's 90cts/bite?

They have the nerve to serve these mini scoops to a Rice eating Asian?

If all other L&L's are serving Mini Scoops of Rice,I'll give my business to one of the other Hawaiian Restaurants nearby.

Yelpers please let me know if same is true at other locations."}
{"text":"I started ordering from this L&L for the last 3 - 4 months or so because of the reviews. 
Up till now, I felt this location made the best Spam Fried Rice of all the other locations until last Thursday.

I ordered 2 Spam Fried Rice last Thursday for myself & wife.
 When I started to eat, I thought they just gave me plain fried rice until I noticed that there were a few pieces of spam in mine. Had to move rice around to even find a piece of spam.

I thought maybe more spam ended up in my wife's order but upon checking her rice found the same with hers.

Could not have been more than 1/2 to one slice, if even that, chopped up in each container. Had to really move rice around to even find a piece of spam.

I wouldn't have been too upset if they told me they ran out of spam but would makeup for it the next time I ordered but they never said anything.

I ordered \"to go\" but still tipped them as I usually do, even if I order to go.

I'm sure the female cashier didn't know but the deceitful cook surely knew what he was doing. 

1 Start for this L&L in general.
\"0\" Star for the Spam Fried Rice
-5 Star for the deceitful cook!

If I order from this location again, I will check my order before paying & leaving.

Was happy with my recent visits where the spam fried rice was really good, so raise to 4 stars.
My last order was great!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because they were busy or whatever but the food here was so bland and undercooked. The cashier guy didn't seem too friendly either. 

Small ahi poke - ok so when they said \"small\" I was thinking they would put it in the spam musubi styrofoam containers but they gave me this small ass container where they put the mac salad in. It was good but definitely not worth $5.99 for that tiny portion. BOOOO. 

BBQ chicken was flavorless. It wasn't anything special and I feel like they rushed it because they were so busy. And they only gave two tiny ass scoops of rice too. Wtf yo. I guess I'm just used to Hawaiian BBQ's generous portions. 

Curry chicken katsu was also flavorless! And I freaking love katsu. They managed to screw up all of the food items I love. Very disappointed. 

Service was also incredibly slow but they were very busy. I don't think I'll ever be coming back though. I'm sticking to Ohana BBQ for katsu and BBQ chicken and island flavor for poke."}
{"text":"Order take out for lunch and everything was ready within 10-15 mins. Food was fresh and delish."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 Stars I would. This is the worst Hawaiian Barbecue I've ever had in my life. There was a cup of breading on my fried shrimp. The breading was horribly salty and inside of this massive lump was a very small shrimp that was overcooked and chewy. The mahi-mahi was completely bland and that breading had too little salt. Since these are probably made at the same time I'm kind of confused how that was. They have a really nasty teriyaki sauce as well to put on top of your rice. The thai tea was gross. Never had one with tapioca flavoring. When I ordered, she kept trying to force me into getting another combo which was a few cents more. But when I said no, she was still pushy. And last but definitely not least, it was the most disgustingly dirty, hot and sweaty, devoid of all cleanliness, eating establishment I've ever been to .  And the smell of raw sewage that smacks you in the face when you go into the restroom, is beyond disgusting! I will never come back here again. EVER"}
{"text":"I came to this L&L back in late June of this year as my last stop before driving back home to Escondido. It was my fourth day in Vegas, I was exhausted, emaciated, undernourished, sleep deprived, four pounds lighter, possibly still inebriated after attending a 3 day long electronic dance music festival there at the LV Motor Speedway, I was craving for something cheap and nutritious to get me through what was going to seem like an excruciating four hour drive, I got on Yelp and searched for Hawaiian BBQ and this where it lead me to.

I went in there thinking, \"This is Vegas, it can't be as good as the L&L back home\", I ordered (it was one of the healthy food items on the menu), got my Pepsi, sat down for about 10 minutes while staring at the counter girl (either she thought I was cute, or perhaps just awed by how fucked up I look, idk) anyway, I get my food, ask for some extra teriyaki, go back to sit down and immediately start devouring my food. Wow, the food tasted effing bomb!! Idk whether it was the fact I had not eaten very well in the last few days and I was starving, but the food here tasted just as good as it did back home, or even better. I was tempted to order more, but restrained myself, knowing I had a four to six hour drive ahead of me and didn't wanna have to stop along the way to do my biz. 

This is one of the nicer L&L's I been to, I really like the ambiance of it. I also liked the fact that it was bigger than the one back home and the fact that my friends and I were the only people there dining at the time. I didn't have to feel paranoid about other people watching me eat like a maniac (except for the cashier girl and my friends), I'll be back to this location when in the area no doubt."}
{"text":"I always come here if I want hawaiian food! Nothing can go wrong with it.  My favorite is chicken katsu. Served in big portions for a good price. They even do happy hours for cheap discounts! 

When u get your order, they always serve in in a to go box because of big portions, convenient if u can't finish. Just take it home."}
{"text":"The food was spot on when we went here. We had the mix plate and everything tasted good. The Mac salad is awesome. The only thing that could be better is the customer service the person taking the order did not seem to want to be there at all."}
{"text":"So to be honest I'm kind of sad that this place had 3 stars. 

I had lunch here today let me tell you it was pretty good. The service was very quick and proficient which I absolutely love! The spicy chicken was super spicy. It had a kick right when you bit into it. The katsu was nice and crispy. The breading stayed on the chicken which some places do have a problem with. The katsu sauce was thick but no to sweet or tangy. The macaroni salad had some tuna in it which I thought was strange but unique. I could've done without though. The cream cheese wontons were crazy though. They were not stingey with their filling at all and there were no air bubbles in the wonton. Although they didn't have to put as much filling as they did it was a bit much.

I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing every time.  Relatively quick turnaround time too. Friendly staff.  The healthiest food you can get for the price (chicken and veggies for $5 surely beats a burger and fries for $8)!  Highly recommend. Even my 2 year old loves it!"}
{"text":"Food is good & service was awesome. Came here after work, to go orders of spam musubi and the seafood combo. The spam musubi was superb. Seafood combo included fried shrimp, fried fish & a choice of meat... Of course I chose short ribs, my absolute fav. I had previously order the bbq mix at another L&L location, I prefer the seafood combo, it's delicious if you like seafood & meat... The bbq mix is meat overload. If you've never tried spam musubi, you're missing out! Must try!!! Esp if you love spam, it is delicious! 

The cashier was very friendly as well, love good service! 

Will defiantly be coming back when my Hawaiian food cravings are kicking in :)"}
{"text":"I only order the Chicken Katsu from here and it is very good. The sauce is yummy + mac salad that comes with is delicious :) 

Customer service is great."}
{"text":"L&L is always my go to. I freaking love this place! I love the Katsu chicken and the bbq chicken. Always friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for my lunch break... I have nothing bad to say about this place. I ordered the mini short rib combo ( one of my favs!) it came with 2 short ribs that were a decent size.. Well flavored, just a tad bit salty.. Macaroni salad was good as well... Food was hot & fresh."}
{"text":"I actually ran across this place by accident.

Kinda stuck away in a super shopping center!

I had a super dish of BBQ chicken bowl!  Yum  Loved it!  

The staff was very professional and the restaurant was very clean and had a nice atmosphere!

It was delicious  and I would totally go back!

I would definitely recommend for fast food  on the go or even sit in!"}
{"text":"This place has many great choices. The girl staffs are friendly. The male staff are okay. The Hawaiian beef tastes great, the chicken tastes good, and the shrimp could be better. The Saimin soup tastes great: it's basically ramen noodles with a choice of meat. The price for the portion they give is just right. I usually end up eating half of it and eat the other half later."}
{"text":"What can I say, this might be the best L & L I've ever been too. Service and food was on point! Eric is the best cashier/spam musubi packer in the game! His customer service is award worthy! Check this place out you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is bomb and service is great. I really enjoy the spam masubi!  The combo plates are really good too, especially the catsu and BBQ beef!  

Call your order ahead for even quicker service!"}
{"text":"preatty good food, not tooo expensive but they give reallly good portion size of food. fast and it look clean kitchen, and the staff were helpfull."}
{"text":"The owners here are so nice, the katsu is consistently good. 
Support your local mom & pop L&L.

For those who care, this restaurant carries the Lipton No Calorie \"Juicy Peach\" drink in their soda dispenser."}
{"text":"Very very friendly staff and helpful when I was ordering. I got the order wrong twice!  (meaning I ordered the wrong thing!)  Lady at the counter was so accommodating and fixed my order both times and with a smile!

Food was great, rice fluffy, pulled pork and cabbage was good and mac salad was creamy, just wish the portion size was a little bigger. 

Overall great speedy service. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't like places that closes 10, 20, or 30 minutes before the posted CLOSED time.  Change your closing time if you're going to shut the door on customers before the posted time.."}
{"text":"Addicted to #28

Finally made it in to my Summerlin neighborhood L&L!  So glad they opened this new convenient spot.

Located in the old 50s diner style restaurant you will find all of your favorite items and with plenty of seating and parking.

We ordered #28 Pork with cabbage and an order of the fried shrimp.  Both orders come with the creamy macaroni salad and some rice.  I love that the food is made fresh to order and it's still hot when you get home.  The shrimp is my favorite indulgence, perfect for those stressful days when you're craving some much needed comfort food.

This is a great spot that we will be coming back to over and over again. 

Today was a very warm day and it was a little warm in the diner, so I'm glad I got my order to go.  But I'll be back. I'm bummed I missed all the \"grand opening\" deals but look in your mailbox for coupons.  Go now."}
{"text":"RUDE THAT LADY florina.. i understand. you are pregnant. it would not hurt. for you to be nicer to customers"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but I'm a bit tired of just about ANYBODY being able to buy an L&L Hawaiian Barbecue franchise...then sending it to $h!+.  Seriously, a lot of you L&L owners are doing it WRONG.  If you're not Hawaiian or a resident from Hawaii, fine.  But dammit, some of you HAOLE (foreigner) owners are ruining the Hawaii restaurant's name!  Please, please, PLEASE learn about Hawaiian culture and Hawaiian ways!  Read a book.  Hire at least a Hawaii resident or two for good measure.  Why are just about NONE of the L&L Hawaiian Barbecues here in the mainland nothing like the ones back in Hawaii?  I'll tell you:

1) Food
2) Service

Simple but means so much.  I love how the owners of the original L&L Drive-Inn back in Honolulu came from humble beginnings to now being some of the richest people in all of Hawaii.  Hard work, perseverance, and the spirit of entrepreneurship paid off for them in spades.  For them they deserve great props.  But something just comes off as not inspiring when you branch out too much from your roots.  I wish there was more scrutiny when selecting new franchisees!  They can affect a brand name so much!  I get concerned because back in my island days of Maui I used to eat L&L quite a bit, it's like fast-food comfort for locals.  The food then was simple, uncomplicated, plentiful, affordable, and made with some form of integrity.  Most times you knew the cook, the cashier, the help staff.  Eating at L&L was one heck of a pleasure and a treat back home when I was younger.  Why?  Because livin' in Hawaii is HAHD.  Yes HAHD.  Most of us locals 'no can' eat out that often since food so expensive...restaurant dining was something you looked forward to.  

So I care a lot when places like this become a bit 'bastardized' and start to lose the love.  Where is the love?  Sorry Black Eyed Peas, it ain't here.  I hate to say it, but the recent incarnations of L&L Hawaiian Barbecue are lacking authenticity.  Lacking punch.  NO MO' LOVE!  I am happy but at the same time I am sad.  While the original owners surely get lots of kickback for each L&L franchise started, a little piece of my childhood dies inside.  It cries, then dies.  Then dies again for dramatic effect.  

We went here because this is the closest L&L by our house.  Tucked in a former diner, this L&L is just a fa√ßade of what lies inside.  A mess.

I'll start with the service.  Seems this L&L (like many of them) is owned by yet another Chinese family.  All of the employees that day were Chinese, which I mean no disrespect (I myself am 1/8 Chinese), but many of them were just not very welcoming.  Our cashier wasn't rude, but she wasn't exactly inviting either.  The cooks were hastily shouting out orders in Chinese, and food was constantly just being slopped into containers.  I suppose since it was busy all of us were being hurried along so our cashier could get orders in.  Not even a real \"Hello\" or \"Welcome to L&L\" when we entered.  Where is the local girl with the flower in her hair at the register that was always happy to see us when I was little?  Nani?  Lani?  Puanani?  No where in sight I'm afraid.  Like a candle in the wind goes my fond memories.

Even looking at the menu it's just not the same.  My nostalgia is kicking in but the prices for the food at L&L are kinda getting out of hand.  Really, like $8-$9 for a regular plate?  Even more if you like beef?  Whoa, brah!  Thought L&L was supposed to be a deal for families?  Expensive for what you get.

Next we'll go with the food.  I ended up getting my staple of a Chicken Katsu regular plate.  The wifey got the L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix with teri chicken, teri beef, and short ribs.  The kid got a cheeseburger and fries combo with a drink.  

Overall?  Really below average.  Thankfully the rice was Calrose and it was made decently.  The macaroni salad was CRAP, too much on the watery side and not enough flavor.  I added extra shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco to liven it up.  The entrees?  Not so great.  Chicken katsu looked golden brown on the outside but was pretty flavorless.  Would it kill you guys to season the chicken before you fry it?  The katsu sauce was thumbs down, another mixture of ketchup with who knows what.  This is why I often carry a bottle of decent katsu sauce (like Bulldog) if I know I want katsu.  Wife's BBQ Mix plate?  She didn't like it.  Too little food, and not flavored correctly.  What is up with the SUPER thin slices of beef, chicken, and short rib?  Small serving that left her hungry.  The kid's cheeseburger?  MEH, just a cheeseburger.  Not even a hand made patty like we used to have back at L&L (or just about any Mom & Pop eatery) in Hawaii.  Bun wasn't even toasted!  Fries were just plain crinkle cut.

I wasn't gonna even bother with authentic Hawaiian eats like a bowl of saimin or a Spam Musubi.

This L&L is just all kinds of depressing for me.  Mr. Kam & Mr. Flores, if you guys are still around please visit your stores and bring back the Aloha Spirit!"}
{"text":"They dont have a working business phone!! This location doesnt have online ordering either"}
{"text":"L&L is always a go to. But this location is horrible. The guy behind the counter looks like he hates his job. And the food gets 1.5 out of 5 stars. Pretty bland. All the soda tastes funny like the lines are dirty. DEFINITELY WONT BE BACK. AND WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. NOT EVEN MY ENEMIES."}
{"text":"Our order is totally wind we are very disappointed! This location is new to us we were expecting to see how close it was but this leaves a bad taste. The food is good but if the orders not right it's not right. I ordered the chicken katsu bowel he's ordered chicken cutlet. They didn't give me the bowl and he got something beef. They put the sauce for the cutlet but not the chicken.  We ordered take out so we didn't know till we got home. ):"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Customer service is bad.  They take about 15 minutes to cook the food.  So if you don't feel like waiting it would seem you could call an order in a pick it up, but there is a catch, they never answer their phone.  What restaurant doesn't answer the phone.  Yes you guessed it, a bad one!  This franchise owner needs to wake up.  There bad business practices are hurting the franchise.  Read the reviews, bad customer service, poor quality, long waits equals bad ownership.  Move on to the next place."}
{"text":"Da grinds were ONO, da service not so ono!  If you work at L&L you better know what's on your menu better than da Hawaiian who's ordering it!"}
{"text":"We were driving past, I read the name and my fiance said you want to give it a try?  As is my nature, I said yes.  

The food was good.  My fiance had the Beef Mix and I had the Seafood mix.  I wish mine had not been deep fried but that was my fault for not checking ahead of time.  My fiance's beef was very good.  The cole slaw was great.

The service and attention we received from the young lady behind the counter was FANTASTIC.  I would recommend the place because of her alone.  She truly seemed to understand Hawaiian food and explained thing pretty well.  

Personally, I had a hard time getting past the Spam dishes... something in my mid-westerner snob makeup won't let me try it.  

We may go again at some point."}
{"text":"I completely love the food here! I love Hawaiian food but not everyone knows how to make it! I come here whenever I want my fix, and I get it every time!! The garlic shrimp is one of my favs! Super flavorful and delicious! I'm a sucker for great macaroni salad and I love the sticky rice! Today I'm being a fatty and enjoying every minute of it!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food, this place is number 1 in my book!  BBQ chicken and beef is the best!  For  $10.25 + tax you get a lot of food and the taste is unbeatable! 4 stars because that's pretty much my top rating unless the experience is way over the top."}
{"text":"One of my spots when the wifey ain't around the BBQ mixed is my fav either this or cheesestake !!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and a big portion size. I'm normally able to finish a plate of food easily and I had a lot of chicken katsu left over. Good value"}
{"text":"I tried to call 30 minutes before closing to place an order and I got an answer machine. I pulled up with 20 minutes before closing and the doors are locked. Change the hours online or close when you are suppose to. Agh!! Dick move guys. I love this place too. I was able to write this review, and it's still not 10pm."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ Chicken Bowl and i barely finished half of it.  The rice was overcooked and soft, the chicken was not good quality and they put to much sauce on it and it tasted like teriyaki not BBQ Sauce.  My Roommate bot the BBQ Chicken and he said the same, we will both not be returning.  ALOHA KITCHEN on Maryland is MUCH BETTER! $4.99, You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Great service, and super tasty food! I hadn't had Hawaiian barbecue in ages, and I was looking for some sustenance before driving a couple hours to my next rotation, so this really hit the spot! 

I like that they had the usual, as well as the healthier options! I had the grilled chicken plate with brown rice + greens. It came with 2 packets of ranch dressing + a container of sauce on the side. 

Prices are really reasonable, portions are generous + super filling, and the staff was very friendly + courteous! Good spot for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Service is slow... by the time I finished placing my order over the phone, I already arrived at the location which is dirty to say the least. I'd rather eat in a \"nasty-a$$\" strip club, than eat at this dirty location. The food wasn't even what I was accustomed to enjoying at a typical L & L. Avoid this location"}
{"text":"I've been here about 20 minutes there's a group of 4 guy who haven't received their order and they were here before me. The phone has rung twice now with no answer, and all I ordered was 2 peices of meat and an egg (Atkins plate)  not trolling. It's Hawaiian food..."}
{"text":"The food has been good since I first tried L and Ls back in the early 2000s. BBQ chicken is the bomb so is chicken katsu also gotta love the musubi and boba, and the fish tank is cool.

I have become a vegetarian in recent years and I go there now for the veggie egg rolls and macaroni salad and my family eats all the meat.

Not 5 stars because of the sign saying only 1 refill. I enjoy my soda and I need multiple refills. This is Las Vegas and people are thirsty, also no other fast food place I know of limits refills especially when the drink station is self serve. This is bad customer service. What if I get 2 refills? Will I get kicked out after spending 50 bucks in food and tipping?"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with my order! Pretty yummy food! Not the cheapest prices but you do get a whole bunch of food for what you pay for. The employees aren't friendly though."}
{"text":"Interesting introduction to Hawaiian bbq cuisine.  Best thing ever is they serve brown rice. A nice healthy alternative to white rice.  Cafeteria-style restaurant.

We ordered the following:
- Healthy Garlic Shrimp
- Lau Lau with Brown Rice
- BBQ Chicken Bowl 
- 1/2 pound of Tuna Poke - so fresh & delicious!

Love it.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Cool little diner. Great ambiance, fun and plenty of seating.  The hawaiian BBQ chicken is excellent and the poke is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Went to this location a few weeks ago assuming it would be like other locations ive visited in the past. I ordered the kahlua pork and lau lau plate. The kahlua pork tasted like it had soap in it. It had a very strange chemical taste to it. Also there was barely any pork at all. It was mainly all cabbage. This made me lose my appetite immediately. I brought this to the attention of a very kind asian woman at the register. She quickly refunded the transaction to my credit card. I wont be coming back to this location unfortunately."}
{"text":"For the quality I think it is just average. It does the job of getting you full but definitely nothing healthy"}
{"text":"Came here with the bf recently because he's a fan of L&L. I personally feel that all Hawaiian barbecue places are pretty much the same, but I like this L&L because the service was really great. The owner was super friendly and helpful, and you can tell he really enjoys cooking and serving his guests. Our katsu was a little over cooked, too crispy for my liking, but perfect for my bf's. Their homemade curry sauce is a must-try. It's also in a great location, right next to a theater so you can grab a bite before or after a movie. Will try again!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Hawaiian Food that I've ever tasted.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken bowl and they gave me a slab of uncut fatty chicken that had very little flavor on top of a bed of rice.  When asked for teri sauce, they pointed to a place on the counter where there were a few bottles of what they called teri.  Don't waste your time or money.  The best thing they have is the Fountain Drinks."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. The very unpleasant old lady argued with my fianc√©e about what she could order. She would not take special orders like adding an extra egg to a loco moco. After the food was ready everything was wrong. When I told her that it was wrong she flipped out and screamed at us to get out in front of all the other customers. 

Of course I requested a refund prior to leaving without the messed up orders. A cook had to come and console this old lady because she was shaking while giving me the refund. She then slammed the receipt on the counter and said she wouldn't serve us if we came back. 

I left the restaurant and when I was halfway to my car I heard a commotion behind me. This crazy old lady had actually chased me out to my car screaming in Korean. The cook had to run out and restrain her from pursuing me any further. He literally had to push her back inside. As I was driving off she came running out again screaming and shaking her fists.

DO NOT GO TO THIS L&L. HORRIBLE (CRAZY) SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Hawaiian places in this neighborhood but I still like this one the best. I enjoy the fried shrimp, bbq beef, bbq chicken, mochicko chicken... My wife likes the garlic shrimp and orders it every time if they have it in stock. They open early at 10 if you are getting the munchies before lunch. I usually call ahead and order pick up and it is almost always ready by the time I get there or with very little waiting time. Nice employees too."}
{"text":"Sure, it may not be \"the best\" when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ, but here's why I love L & L when I'm in Vegas:

This place is a perfect escape from the overpriced, overdone, overhyped joints that plague the Vegas strip. It's worth the very short drive off-strip to tuck into a big styrofoam container of rice, meat and mac salad. There are no frills and no pretense. At the same time, it's not as common as the McDonald's or other fast food that might serve as a break from the high-end fare in most hotels.

Most touristy places in Vegas that should serve food for budget prices usually don't. A hot dog anywhere near the strip can easily be dressed up to a $15 meal if you're not careful. There's no fear of that happening at L & L, though. The prices are always reasonable for huge portions.

Kahlua pork and the mixed grill were winners on my last visit. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Got the fried mahi mahi and malasadas. Their macaroni salad is so good and sticky rice is perfect. Customer service was nice and didn't take too long. I've always been a fan of l&l since it allows me to get my fix in towns that wouldn't necessarily have Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"1. Not consistent with other L&L's
2. WORST customer service experience.
3. If YOUR soda machine is not working properly, do NOT make your customers do your job of pressing, holding the lever for the CO2 to start flowing. Are you nuts?!

Our nephews were in from town and they wanted loco moco's so they decided that they wanted to eat it at L&L.

We usually get the healthy plate which is salad, scoop of brown rice and shrimp. Well the L&L that we used to go to (on the east side) had this dressing that was DEEEEElicious. This place only had ranch, bleh.

The gal behind the counter, name was Looy, Loopy, fuck if I know. She was horrible and needs to have a lesson or 10 in proper, friendly customer service. .. She was rude, made it seem as though it was not her problem to handle to soda machine issue and any time you ask her a question, it was as though you were interrupting her social media time on her phone since that seemed to be the only thing that the girl did.

The food was mediocre at best. Nothing consistent or anything that wowed us. Our nephews are from Chicago so they haven't been exposed to too many Hawaiian restaurants. For their next visit, we're going to take them to another L&L and avoid this place. Like the plague. Like a big piece of poop that it is."}
{"text":"I agree with Soheila, all L&Ls are not created equal. They may have the same name, and may have to follow the same recipes but it doesn't mean that they all use the same cooks nor do they cook things the exact same way, they SHOULD but they don't. Fortunately for me, I enjoyed my experience at this location.

We ordered the healthy plate, garlic shrimp salad and the short ribs plate with shrimp and an extra side of Mac salad. The plate was OK. Not sure if we'd order it again, or at least without the shrimp we chose. The shrimp was breaded and it seemed like there was more breading than shrimp. But the salad and the shrimp was SO good! 

I always knew this place was here but never had the chance to eat here, glad we did, I enjoyed my lunch that day ;)"}
{"text":"Dang, the servings are huuuuuuuuge. 
I got the kalbi plate with all rice. The meat was OK and the marinade was not my fave. 

Chicken katsu was an average 3 rating. I do not like their katsu sauce,  so I used the traditional Japanese katsu sauce from home and all was good."}
{"text":"Other L&L locations have always been decent, but this location has served me horrible food twice. I didn't want to write a review after one bad visit, but after two? You leave me no choice. 
Chicken katsu: Is there even chicken in it? There is a thin sliver of chicken with fried breading 4x as thick. In addition to that it's fried so much I had a hard time getting a fork through it. 
Kalua pig: salty, salty and drenched in water. The pork was like a soup! 
Macaroni salad: watered down and no creamy texture at all. 

The inside isn't very clean and the workers aren't friendly either. I was so disappointed after my visit! There are so many other Hawaiian restaurants in the area that serve better quality food. Sorry L&L, I'm never eating here again :("}
{"text":"Always a good place to stop in for a mana pua and a plate of Kailua pork! Never had a bad meal!!! Great Mac salad too."}
{"text":"The food was good a bit overpriced but whatever. The problem was the service the lady working at the register was unfriendly and unresponsive. I had ordered the green salad instead of the Mac salad but instead she gave me the Mac salad. I told her it was wrong and rudely she said it would be 50¬¢ more. Waited 20 minutes then just left. The lady that works there is brain dead."}
{"text":"Typical Hawaiian BBQ which was pretty good. I ordered BBQ mixed plate which was really good...what I enjoyed the most was that you got really good portions of each type of BBQ. The BBQ consisted of Beef, Pork and Chicken. You also get a side of Macaroni Salad. Overall a pretty good place to get decent food"}
{"text":"Decent service. Be mindful of punk ass kids behind you who like to trash your signed receipts and are probably swiping from the tip jar when the employee and other patrons aren't looking. Compared to other locations, this seems to attract more of a young shitty demographic."}
{"text":"One of my fave locations! The cashiers are always extremely friendly and pleasant, one of them even remembers me and my family. The food is always good, never burnt or dry."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here.. The food is decent and for the price and the amount of portioning they give you, well it's not a bad deal. I recommend trying it atleast once if you want cheaper hawaiin food..."}
{"text":"Always a good place to come and get local foods. My husband loves their loco moco while I like their BBQ mixed plate. Their Mac salad is a hit or miss but it's usually the sodium levels that's the issue. We still go and get our tummies filled."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Hawaiian food. I ordered Chicken Katsu plate. It's generous for a 'small' size box. I don't know if the sauce that comes with it is supposed to be cold.. The macaroni salad was good though. My meal was basically filled with cut up crispy chicken and a little rice. There wasn't enough rice compared to the amount of chicken. If I were to go back, I'd try something else."}
{"text":"Again I must report, this place is ok, just ok. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to decry either. So there you go. All I can say is two scoops of rice is too much. There wis better fast food out there now go and find it. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I just ordered short ribs. And I know their quality isn't the best, but when I got home and opened my dinner, I got the most thinly cut horribly cooked short ribs I've ever gotten. ever!!!! And I am not one to complain, but this is ridiculous! Not happy at all!"}
{"text":"The cashier working today at 12:45 called my wife and I liars we ordered the chicken and received beef, I distinctly ordered the number 17 which is chicken and got beef, she stated that's what we ordered and that is false, how do you get # 4 from 17 then she embarrassed us and had an attitude she was perfect and stated that clearly that she can't be fired or reprimanded she us untouchable. Is this how you treat customers. BAD BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"I always go to this location because their rice is perfectly cooked. Not mushy at all than some other locations. They are accommodating to special requests 

Some of the dishes are not authentic Hawaiian food but it come very close. 

My first choice is always island sushi and grill with l&l's a close second !!"}
{"text":"This place has a great short rib plate.  Too bad the price has jumped so much. 10 bucks a plate seems high! Only eat when I get a craving."}
{"text":"This new location was fantastic.  They have grand opening rates of buy one get one 50% off.  Get it while you can. There short ribs were perfect.  Anyone have the phone number though? Will need to call it in to avoid wait!"}
{"text":"Not too concerned with customer satisfaction... Ordered the seafood platter (fish, shrimp and scallops) but they were out of scallops. Gave me a choice to replace with beef, pork or chicken, but not short ribs. Short ribs cost $1 more than the other 3. (But are they $1 more than scallops?) I settled for the chicken. Tasty, but not scallops!

I'll avoid this one from now on."}
{"text":"This is an okay spot to grab a quick lunch, but not really a place I would make much effort to eat at again. 

My first impression is that the inside of the restaurant feels a little grubby. It wasn't the cleanest and the colors inside were very unappealing. However, the cashier that took my order was very friendly and offered some recommendations since it was my first time in. The wait wasn't too long for the food.

I had the Chicken Katsu that came with rice and macaroni salad. The chicken was good, but a little heavy and fatty. The rice was good and the macaroni salad was okay. It was a decent amount of food for the price. It'd be nice if they offered any form of vegetable as a standard option with the plates though."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this location because they give you such small amounts of food. All the other locations give decent portions except for this one.

I will avoid this location & go to the other ones around the Las Vegas valley!"}
{"text":"This place is nasty!  Never even tried the food because the restaurant is dirty and the rude older asian women made us want anything else to eat.  Weird that drinks are allowed to be refilled only once!  How cheap can you be..ive never seen that in a restaurant that has fountain drinks."}
{"text":"cant say enough about food and portions.  it only misses a 5 star bc there are cheaper ways to fill your stomach.  however, its a mainstay when i am looking to splurge on some good, fast eats."}
{"text":"This place can be brilliant and it can also be a total miss, my favorite thing on the menu would be the mocchco chicken. The atmosphere is pretty decent nothing over the top but not bad at all. Food at times can be a little salty if you get the wrong cook. But portions a decent sized"}
{"text":"The food is not the problem it's always good it's the guy up front rude and has the personality of a rock has zero customer service skills at all the experience would be far more enjoyable if not set off on the wrong foot by bad customer service I'm sorry terrible customer service"}
{"text":"Ordered the Hawaiian combo with Lau Lau and hoped they can't mess up that, knowing they don't make that from scratch and know it's shipped from Hawaii. Wrong! Even that was like eating something that sat out on a buffet longer than the allotted and health code time. There are other places in town to get better \"Hawaiian\" food. Too bad this franchise doesn't correct the wrongs that other L&L's are doing to make them look bad as a company! Keep the menu simple and don't over sauce and drench everything with \"Teriyaki\" flavored sauces. No I don't go to a Hawaiian fast food to get Chinese food either!"}
{"text":"Why oh why did I waste my time here? This food flat out sucked! I should've listened to that little guy on my shoulder telling me to stay away! Sorry dear Aloha Kitchen. I have betrayed you........

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the workers were very nice. I ordered the half & half combo (chicken & beef) with all rice. I got my food pretty quickly and was ready to conquer this meal I thought would've at least been decent until I opened the box. :-/

The beef was so fatty! It didn't taste that bad but the task of pulling the good part of the meat off of the fat just killed my vibe. The chicken was okay until I bit into a piece that still had the skin attached. Not to mention the rice was mediocre. The $10+ dollars I paid for this was not worth it. The Pepsi was the only highlight from my visit. If you want the real deal Holyfield, drive down to Charleston and stop at Aloha Kitchen. That place has me begging for more while this place just.............? I'll let you fill in the caption!

P.S. The one on Maryland Pkwy is even worse than this. Stay away!"}
{"text":"It's somewhere between good and bad depending on your tongue. On my visit here, the beef was chewy like beef jerky which to me is no good.

The service was polite and friendly but slow. This place was obviously a diner before it became L&L and it needed some maintenance inside. The portions are generous and the food is fresh but I personally prefer Aloha Kitchen over this place. Here, they serve your typical L&L fare and it's nothing really to rave about if you've had it a few times. I don't think there's anything particularly special or magical about this place other than that it's oddly placed in a former 50's style diner.

I only came here 'cause it's closer to my apartment and I was craving Hawaiian BBQ and I didn't feel like driving all the way to the Aloha Kitchen on Charleston or the Island Sushi & Grill in Henderson (both of which I highly recommend). I don't think I'll become a regular here."}
{"text":"I've long looked over L&L as an option for eating in my part of the hood. Yes, this L&L happens to be off of Valley View and Nellis Blvd. I decided to pop in there today as I was running errands and because I am on a tight budget right now, I just didn't have it in me to drive myself anywhere else in the valley.

Let's start off with the pro's:

The restaurant is very clean, tables and seating look new or if not, very well taken care of. The service was impeccable, incredibly nice, happy, and genuine. The food came out relatively quickly.

What I ordered:

Curry Chicken Katsu Bowl: Meh. The bowl was almost over halfway filled with rice, very little curry sauce. It could have used A LOT more curry sauce. The veggies were pretty obviously of the frozen variety, topped with those carrots that have the weird ridges on them... I don't know what the appeal of having carrots like that is. I'd rather my food just look like what it is supposed to look like.... no some weird machine-manufactured vegetable. The chicken, although moist, was kind of bready, and not in a good way. 

Spam Musubi: Yum! I really liked it. Perfectly and tightly wrapped, plus just enough sauce and salty spam. I would order this again.

Overall... I like Aloha Kitchen over L&L and AK is closer to my house. I don't think I would completely take this L&L off my list, but it's not high up either. If I go back, maybe I should try the BBQ.... hmm."}
{"text":"Came in for a hamburger....wasn't thrilled about how the meat tasted...and was disappointed that they had no mustard here. The hamburgers in prison taste better then the ones that are made here....personal opinion....but others may like them."}
{"text":"Ok, I am definately not the most experienced with Hawaiian cuisine so I am putting that up front.  
So from that point of view let me just say that we were in the neighborhood and decided to try something different (Not from vegas) and this place was close to where we were.   It was delicious!   We made the mistake of ordering an entree each and an app to split.   We had no idea that meant we would get like 10 pounds of food.. ok, exaggerating but seriously over 3 pounds would be truth.   When we were done I looked at the food and thought to myself I would not have been upset if that is the amount we had been given.
Now it was very clean and as soon as someone got up the lady behind the counter cleaned the table almost immediately.   The only smells we had were the ones that were Asian cooking and frying meats.
As to the food itself, I did not have anything that was bad..  nothing that I thought was the best food I had ever had but still good solid food at a decent price and plenty of it.   Sorta like the old days in vegas as one of the buffets.. cheap, plenty, and decent!"}
{"text":"I ordered Take Out again on a Monday night.  Every table was taken, so I waited outside until some customers left.  They were located near Red Rock Casino on W Charleston Blvd/S Pavillion Dr in Las Vegas.

I ordered the BBQ Mix Plate which included BBQ Beef, short ribs, and chicken on a bed of raw cabbage.  Everything was tough and fatty.  The macaroni salad was well seasoned.

The Spam Musubi ($2.25 each) was warm and melt in your mouth good.  I'm glad I ordered 2 of them.  

The Spam Musubi is what keeps me coming back for more while I'm visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is good but the Asian woman behind the counter has no personality!!! Poor customer service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to L&L locations in vegas for years now, and while most of them serve the same thing there are subtle nuances to each place (sauces, service, food quality). This place is my favorite, because they make the best kalua pork and homemade teriyaki sauce! Unfortunately, that is the only thing I order anymore because I find the other menu items to be \"hit and miss\" (good once, bad other times). The service there is also very poor as well you will often find the cashier annoyed or busy talking. I just go to get my kalua pork and run! 

Pros:
1. Kalua pork is amazing!
2. Homemade teriyaki sauce is amazing!
3. Macaroni salad is amazing!

Cons:
1. The service sucks.
2. The neighborhood/location sucks.
3. Every once in a while they make a sucky dish."}
{"text":"Considering this particular L&L franchise is in Las Vegas, pretty decent Hawaiian style plate lunches are served here. For the uninitiated, don't expect gourmet food here. IMHO for better or worse, stuff here tastes like it could have been made in Hawaii; so I would say it passes the Hawaii plate lunch test. I usually have the chicken katsu, and boy, do they give you a lot. So if you are yearning for a lot of pretty authentic Hawaii-style chicken katsu plate lunch in Clark County, I would say this is definitely the place for you!"}
{"text":"Wouldve given 4 stars for portions & pricing And beef flavors, but the BBQ chicken was a huge letdown and one of us doesn't eat beef, so that sucked for him especially. Bbq chicken had No sauce whatsoever, seasoning was not strong enough to go sauceless.l, it should just be called grilled chicken.  Service was nice, though, and they were quick and polite even though we showed up pretty late. Solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a quick Hawaiian food fix! I like how you can mix your favorite items in a combo. I typically get the beef with the fried shrimp. The portions are huge. There is always enough for lunch the next day!  I usually save most of the beef and eat the shrimp because it doesn't taste as good the next day. The service is friendly and they have Siracha at every table which is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Regret coming here (no A.C) 
No customer service.
I wasn't sure either to wait for the 1 waitress to bring the menu? Or
I guess I have to get the menu upfront by the register and order? But then after ordering I see her going towards a table w/ confused customers (seniors)
Took for ever to get my food......
I guess family owned because they had the wife's going back & forth from the kitchen to a new born baby crying constantlyat a near by table...
We ordered the pork bowl 
(not good at all!) 
Beef #3 (hubby) kinda ok...
Chicken bowl ok...
Then we witness an angry customer complaining about getting the wrong to-go order
Anyways we get home and my hubby had a major stomach issue
If you don't know much about taste/quality food you'll Love this place."}
{"text":"first off i love absolutely love Hawaiian food. 
i went shopping over at the walmart and decided to go to red robin which is right down eastern. but then i saw L&L across the cold parking lot. i have eaten at this place before. i knew what i was in for. 
i was there with my nephew(3) and my sister. 
my sister got the 1/2 & 1/2 plate, half BBQ chicken and half BBQ beef. i got the same thing but i substituted the BBQ chicken for chicken katsu.i also got an ahi poke. the little guy got french fries and part of our stuff, he loves rice 
the food was excellent. i loved it, sister loved it and the little guy did too. 
the BBQ chicken was a little too done my sister told me and the ahi poke was a bit on the small side. the mac salad made up for it. quite possibly the BEST mac salad in town. 
the only complaint that i have is that they don't have booths to sit in and the chairs are a lil on the rickety side. other than that very great food, very very friendly staff, and clean. 
would i go again?? does a fat kid like cake? of course ill go again it don't fit to often in the low cal lifestyle I'm living but a good splurge is good for the soul."}
{"text":"Love this place. Now that they opened up in Summerlin, I no longer have to travel far for my Loco Moco and favorite mac salad. Also, this location has brown rice which some of the other locations do not."}
{"text":"What is the hype about this place? I have had better food in Tijuana from street vendors. The short ribs were overdone, the mahi mahi was watery and undercooked and my shrimp were crunchy all the way thru as they obviously were fried way to long.
This was my first visit to an L&L Hawaian BBQ and if the reviews are correct about this being better than other locations then I will steer clear of them, not sure this place is worth a second chance."}
{"text":"Perfect for fighting burger boredom, fast fresh grill and big portions. Been coming here for months and it's always been spot on. BBQ mix plate is my go-to, though lately chicken katsu is winning me over. 

Made fresh so don't expect food coming out quickly."}
{"text":"Im not sure if they read my review but the service is back up to par. 
Im not sure who the one young lady was that was working there after my favorite left but she is no longer there.  The new people are warm, welcoming and are actually happy to see you walk in.
Still my favorite Friday food!"}
{"text":"Loco moco is my favorite food to eat I also drank Hawaiian sun Island ice tea mahalo for having the restaurant @ this location"}
{"text":"I've only been to L&L once, and I don't know that I'll come back anytime soon. See, the thing is, there are a lot of other places to get good Hawaiian food, so...

I came to this place a little before noon one day while waiting for a job interview. The place was empty, and the girl working the register was herself eating some teriyaki chicken. It looked good, so I ordered myself the same thing!

When I FINALLY got my order (it seemed to take too long considering I was the only one there) and started to chow down, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was good, but it wasn't as piping hot as I expected it would be. Plus, there wasn't a lot of sauce like I was expecting. The only thing that seemed to be really good was the rice, which, admittedly, isn't the hardest thing to make. 

As I was eating, a guy came in to order some food. He ordered something, and was out a few minutes later. I think they hadn't fired up the grill until I got there, so the second order was quicker than mine. 

The food here was passable, and didn't seem to expensive, either. It's just that, when compared to Aloha Kitchen, this place fails. It's not as good, as fast, or even as cheap. I'll come here again, sure, but it won't be because I'm dying to come here."}
{"text":"Whenever I want teriyaki chicken, I go to Aloha Kitchen. It's my go-to spot, to the point where I realized there were probably other places I should hit up. And that's the story of how I wound up at L&L. 

So I walked in and immediately noticed the place isn't in the best shape. I usually don't care too much about decor as long as service and food are on point, but this place could use some attention to detail. It's more than someone needs to scrub that sucker down... someone with ADD needs to get in that piece and go to town. That aside, the service was good. I asked the girl at the counter if they had teriyaki chicken and she said yeah. I ordered one of those plates and a barbecue platter. Both plates were ok.... like if I were hungry and you offered me that, I would be ok. But when you're mad jonesing for something, you need to get that something perfectly. That didn't happen. The teri chicken was liked some grilled chicken with a little bit of teriyaki sauce on the side. The mac salad, even, was just ok. 

Will I return here? Maybe. The food isn't bad and service was ok. But will I return here when I'm mad for chicken teri? No."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is so simple and always hits the spot. I always get the BBQ Mix Plate with Katsu chicken. Always cooked fresh and you get plenty of food, enough for 2 meals!"}
{"text":"Great, fast and delicious! A few years ago, on a trip to Hawai'i, I became addicted to Loco Moco. I've made it dozens of times at home since, but it's tough to find in a restaurant done well. This place is fantastic (minus the crappy R&B slow jam music)! They've got a large menu, and the food is fresh. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked my bbq combo and the mac salad. It seemed clean enough. It was not expensive. The folks were nice. The food was fast n hot. No issues here and I will be back. I get to pretend I am some sort of food expert on yelp but I am not. I am not full of unrealistic expectations at a fast.food Hawaiian bbq place."}
{"text":"Good eats.   Forget the fake franchised BBQ chicken chains.  This place tasted like I was in Kihei.  The Kahlua pork was bomb."}
{"text":"Seriously? I ordered chicken katsu and there was literally no chicken in there. There were only about 10 pieces with super very think meat in there out of almost 20 pieces. And katsu was so dry... either they cooked too long or use so bad almost trash quality of chicken katsu. You guys shouldnt keep opening the business man... aloha kitchen is way better than this ridiculous place. I usually don't leave the reviews but this time was too much."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE, RUDE!!!! Went and ordered their chic curry katsu, curry on the side Togo. They gave me gravy instead. And I didn't even think to check it until I got home. I called them and told them what had happened, the person on the phone told me that he would give me a brand new plate when I go back since I have to drive back there. I sent my husband to pick up the plate and he came back with just the curry sauce. He informed me that the guy that told me that he was going to give me the plate went to the back and went back on his words. And in addition to that they were rude enough to speak in their language pointing at my husband. 

A Business should not make promises that they cannot keep. I did not have to send my husband back just to pick up some sauce!!!"}
{"text":"I'm all about cheap good food because of budget. Hawaiian food has always been on the list because I get to split the meal into two. That been said, I've tried a lot of different Hawaiian places and this is one of the not so good one. The Katsu chicken is flat out dry and over fried with no flavoring. I'm not saying that it felt like eating beef jerky but it certainly shown significant room for improvement. Moving onto the sauce. Yes, I am going there! It was very water-y and light flavored. I want to believe that they are doing this by design for health purpose. But other than that, I personally cannot come up with any other excuse for mess up sauce. It is not for me and my personal preference, but you are sure welcome to try and hope you enjoy it more than I did."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting.  meat is cold and dark color same with the calamari, dry and dry like a rubber."}
{"text":"So believe me I love l&l bbq I've been going to eat there for years. Until at this location (that I've been to in the past) put tuna in the Mac salad WTF!!! It was the most disgusting tasting Mac I've had from l&l
When I asked about why they destroyed the Mac salad the girl behind the counter said \"there has always been tuna in the Mac salad\" really ? Because no that's completely wrong. So i tossed my Mac salad away and finished my food. 
But then it started messing with me maybe all these years I just haven't noticed so I did some investigating and Called around to other locations and guess FN what they don't put tuna in the Mac salad apparently just that terrible location so just an FYI if your Mac salad tastes spoiled or tastes like your mouth in the morning after puking all night then your Mac salad has tuna in it and that is just gross and wrong and lost my business FOR GOOD!!!!! 
Oh and BTW it's like the cheapest tuna possible like a step up from cat food not even the good albacore you get from whole foods  
Well thanks for reading and please just visit a different location because they are ruining the great reputation of L&L"}
{"text":"Affordable, fast, taste awesome!
I love garlic shrimp. Staff are nice and friendly. 
It's a simple but good !"}
{"text":"Setting is an old 50's diner. Really dark outside and inside. Kind of creepy actually. Food tasted just a bit different then other L&L Hawaiian Barbecues. I know they are individually ran but chicken should taste the same as all the others. Service was not great. Wasn't greeted. When she brought the food to the table she didn't say a word, didn't ask if we needed anything, nothing, silent. I would recommend any other L&L besides this one. Only came here because it was near my daughters softball cages and was craving bbq chicken."}
{"text":"Hate to write a bad review for this place bc I love the food...but this is the 2nd time I've gotten food poisoning from the chicken. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a great L and L BBQ Chain. I have tried alot of them. This one is a corporate owned one that is why the quality is on the spot. The one on Maryland in Vegas sucks! It is franchised with the dumb staff taking short cuts which loses quality.  If you like the L and L chains, go to this one!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Don't Go here! This is a disgrace for a L&L Drive Inn. Ordered the loco moco and chicken katsu. The brown sauce was watery. The mac salad was not Hawaiian mac salad. Only one bit and it tasted like mayonnaise paste. The Katsu tasted off and the gravy on the loco moco was gross. They should take away the franchise! 

If you want to go where it tastes like L&L, go to the one on Serene and Eastern!"}
{"text":"The foods pretty good. The service isn't the best, the kid at the register needs to take a customer service class."}
{"text":"I don't like L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. I LOVE L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. Dining and reviewing restaurants in Las Vegas is fun because Las Vegas is the Ninth Island and kind of the sixth borough. 

   Recently, when I working in the vicinity of the Serene Avenue L&L Barbecue, sometimes after a rough day of work, I'd treat myself to a plate lunch. Over time I would explore the menu by trying the chicken katsu, garlic basa, barbecue chicken, seafood combo, and so on. Everything I ordered has been outstanding. 

   In my opinion, L&L is one of the best restaurant deals around. The majority of the mini combos with a medium Pepsi come out to less than $10. The servings are gargantuan. Forget about the regular portion. I order the mini and it is a grand serving. The mini includes a scoop of rice and macaroni salad. Whether I order the barbecue chicken or fish; I'd save the best for last: the macaroni salad. Hitherto now, these taste buds have yet to sample macaroni salad as delicious as L&L. After trying different items from the menu; I would usually return to the barbecue chicken and garlic basil. Usually I will add hieracha sauce to add additional flavor to the chicken and soy sauce to add flavor to the white rice. 

   L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is a self-serve concept. The format is similar to fast food restaurants. When you walk in, there is a menu above the counter. Once you pay, they give you a receipt with the order number and cup for the Pepsi beverage. L&L differentiates itself from the fast food restaurants in the time it takes from order to table. The wait time is customarily between 10 to 15 minutes. It appears that the cooks are making the food fresh. The majority of the tables overlook the Walmart parking lot. There aren't many Hawaii decorations or pictures inside. 

   From my experience L&L is a gateway restaurant. What I mean by Gateway restaurant is a restaurant chain that introduces people to a certain cuisine or style of food. In my case, L&L planted a seed in my mind that grew into an adventure tree out to expand its branches into new Hawaiin restaurants. L&L introduced me to the plate lunch. In recent times, I explored quite a few Hawaiin Barbecue restaurants. The upshot is that even though L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is a chain, I am still fond of it. 

    As I write this review, L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is serving more and more people it's delicious Hawaiin Barbecue as they open new restaurants. For example, just recently they opened a new restaurant off Boulder Highway in Henderson. Whether it's Boulder City or North Las Vegas, I would like to visit an L&L Hawaiian Barbecue to relive the delectable plate lunches that this location has served me."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has the honor of being called the Ninth Island. With that honor the Las Vegas Valley offers honorable Hawaiian Barbecue restaurants. However, this L&L Hawaiian Barbecue (abbreviated L&L) is not one of them. One of the honorable Hawaiian Barbecue restaurants in Las Vegas that I appreciated  to in this location here two times, it is obvious that every L&L is not the same.

   This freestanding L&L franchise  is by the shadow of the Galleria Mall in the Target shopping center at the northwest corner of Sunset Road and Stephanie Street. The restaurant's window actually faces the Galleria's Dillard's. Being that this location is in the shadow of a regional mall, it is convenient to a large population. But in my case, it is convenient to the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve. And the two times that I dined here, which was a Sunday afternoon, it was on the drive back from the bird viewing preserve.
 
  My meal of choice had been the mini plate of Hawaiian barbecue chicken (kind of ironic eating this after a bird viewing preserve) that includes macaroni salad and white rice. I'd complement it with a fountain Pepsi that came out to $9.30. 

  L&L is not a fast food restaurant where the customer orders then the food is instantaneously ready. Here, the gap between ordering and picking up the food is approximately ten minutes. Before picking up my food, I stopped by the Pepsi fountain to fill up my cup. According to this L&L's written policy, there is a sign stating that you are only permitted to refill the cup one time. When you take into consideration that a growing number of restaurants offer Freestyle machines with bottomless refills, this policy makes the restaurant appear stingy. So, with one of my two allowed fill ups from the Pepsi fountain machine, I settled at a table overlooking the fish tank. 

  When I picked up the food, the plate it did not seem to hold the large portions that Hawaiian Barbecue restaurants such as Ross.J, Aloha, and the Serene Avenue L&L had served me. On the other side of the token, the portion wasn't small either. Whether the portion is humongous, medium, or small; the way I delight in Hawaiian barbecue chicken is covering it with schierarcha sauce. And the way I delight in Hawaiian barbecue white rice is covering it with soy sauce. Ultimately, the way I delight in Hawaiian barbecue macaroni salad is to just dig in and savoir every minute of it. As I mentioned in my review of the Serene Avenue L&L and other Hawaiian barbecue restaurants, I cherish their macaroni salad. I saved the macaroni salad for last ending the meal on a high note both times.

 In my opinion, this L&L is Three Stars. My reality is that there are Four Star Hawaiian Barbecue restaurants nearby. For example two of them that are just a couple of miles west on Sunset Road. They are Ross. J in the Smith's-anchored shopping center at Mountain Vista Street and Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue at the corner of Pecos Road."}
{"text":"L&L isn't bad, but it's a victim of being in a very competitive Hawaiian food market in Vegas. If you don't bring your A game, then there are a ton of other options that will fill that role.

I had the Bento combination plate, which is BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, mahi mahi, and chicken katsu. The food was good, but I've had much better in Vegas. The portion size was generous, but again, I've had much larger portions in Vegas.

I'd come here again, but mainly because it's the closest Hawaiian restaurant to the office. It's a serviceable, convenient option when I'm craving Hawaiian for lunch. Outside of that scenario, I'm going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this happens at every location, but at this L&L one of the workers told us the \"Mahi Mahi\" served here is actually Tilapia \"/"}
{"text":"Placed a phone order and the lady was rude. The tone of her voice and the way she responded was uncalled for. If you want business treat your customers right. Whether in person or on the phone"}
{"text":"This specific L&L has massive portions! We got the regular chicken katsu and it came with two huge mounds of rice and the rest katsu chicken and a cup of macaroni salad on the side. Their mini portions are regular sized in California, so we had so many leftovers. They had fast service and if you spend $50 or more, you get the malasadas for free! Perfect to grab before heading to the strip if you're planning to save some money. Their BBQ beef is really good and soft too!"}
{"text":"This review is based on what I ordered. I ordered the chicken katsu curry. Curry on the side. There wasn't much people there. The chicken katsu and everything is the same except for the curry sauce. I did notice that it was watery. Normally it's a thick sauce. I've been to summerlin and southwest. Those are the only two so far that I know of that has thick curry sauce. But overall, everything was good!"}
{"text":"I like their food. Very basic fast food style place - eat out of a styrofoam box and go. Especially when I am doing my low carb days this is my to go place as they have 2 or 3 low carb choices. Very good!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to L&L before a movie the other night and it was muy bien. Hawaiian bbq is one of those things I sort of forget about and then when I have it I'm like \"omg this is so good, why don't I eat it more often\"? 

Sarah H. and her man shared a bbq chicken plate, and I mistakingly thought, \"I don't want bbq so I'll get the chicken katsu\". Mind you, chicken katsu is effing bomb, but after tasting their bbq chicken I wished I had gotten in on some of that. I ordered the mini plate which itself could serve two people (ie; I didn't finish it all), but the rice and mac salad was really good. I don't think I've ever had anything else at a hawaiian bbq place, but I don't really care. I could live off of the bbq chicken and chicken katsu forever. 

Plus the service is always super awesome."}
{"text":"I wish this was a positive review since I love L&L however I received the worst customer service possibly. To start off , cashier was looking down when I walked in, she didn't even acknowledge , I had to be the first one to initialize the greeting , she had no idea of what I was ordering (chicken catsu) she keep saying \"we don't have chicken\" which I honestly thought she was joking. Their tables haven't been wiped out , they're dirty probably since they opened. The trash bin on the floor is over filled with trash , the chairs all out of place. I was dying of hunger and this is why I decided to not cancel my order but definitely will reconsider coming back. 
Needless to say I'm an assistant store manager inside the mall so I know my business and customers are priority !"}
{"text":"Eh... what happened??? This place was'nt excellent but now it sux. I ordered saimin was told \" eh it is only soup\" more like hot water and noodles little cut up spam NO FLAVOR ok that's a fail but worse than he chicken katsu some sort of sweet and sour sauce not even katsu sauce. Sad .... worst food"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  At first I really liked the place, but upon reflection I haven't really had anything great.  The portion sizes are huge and the prices are pretty good.  The combos plates offer a pretty good mix, and the chicken katsu and beef short ribs are pretty tasty.  I had the kalua pork once and it was too salty for my tastes.  I know it's Hawaiian BBQ-style food, but I always wish that whatever I ordered had come with some kind of vegetables.  Just eating meat, rice, and mac salad makes for a really heavy meal."}
{"text":"I like this place very much, it's clean, fast, with good service and very good food. I'm no expert in hawaiian food, so I can't really tell if it's traditional or not, but it's a place where I like do drop every now n then at my lunch hour because you get a good, big size meal, with the speed of a fast food joint but without the feeling it's junk food. They've got a choice of dishes that include lots of combinations of meats, chicken, seafood, beef, etc. there are small portion options as well as  large servings for people (like me) who could eat a fried elephant at lunch. My usual is the chicken bbq, i love it. And personally, I absolutely love their macaroni salad, it's sooooo good! Plus, the place has free wi fi for customers so, thats a nice extra."}
{"text":"Mmmmm yummy in my tummy!!!  Got the regular chicken katsu plate and it was GOOD!!!!  The chicken was super crispy and cooked perfectly!   Katsu sauce was really good and had the perfect amount of spice!   Wish I had the recipe for their macaroni salad, mmmm!!   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food here was actually pretty decent, though the beef dishes I had were a bit too fatty. 

I was surprised when the employee had a great suggestion right away for me when I wasn't sure what I wanted. 

The teriyaki sauce is better than their grill sauce, though. Also goes very good on the white rice they serve."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ chicken bowl for dinner.. delish! Service was friendly and the price was fair."}
{"text":"Compared to Aloha Kitchen, this place just doesn't stack up. The meats are much saltier, and seem very processed, in comparison. The Kalua Pork lacks depth.. it tastes like it was soaked in liquid smoke, and salt for a few days... and the Katsu chicken is of school cafeteria quality. It's not the worst food I've ever eaten, but doesn't compare to the home-made feel of Aloha Kitchen, or other non-chain Hawaiian places I've eaten at in So.Cal."}
{"text":"Chicken KATSU is the best it's sooooo YUMMY. Amazing quick always worth the price so so good."}
{"text":"I ordered the bbq chicken ramen soup. I called ahead to place my order as I was in a bit of a hurry. When I arrived I walked right up to the register to pay. I gave my name and paid. I waited for about 10 minutes for the soup. I could see the cook preparing it so I didn't mind the wait as I knew it was going to be fresh. I received my soup complete with chopsticks, fork and spoon as well as a soy sauce packet if I chose to use it. Overall it was a great experience. The restaurant is clean and has a nice Hawaiian vibe to it. Will go back to try other things in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate at this L&L.  We were impressed.  They did a great job and the food was as good or better than the L&L we ate at a lot on the big island."}
{"text":"The worst L&L in Vegas. The bathroom was so dirty I couldn't believe I was in a restaurant because my mechanic had a cleaner shop. If I wasn't late and starving I would have went somewhere else. The BBQ Chicken was no where near the best L&L I have had. Sad because a location like that should be a cash cow for the owners, I'm sure it was dead because of the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Food is good but this is the worst customer service that we ever experienced. We felt like we got treated unequal. So funny how he brought the food to everyone's table but when it comes to ours, he called our number with his unhappy voice.  Basically we were told to pick it up. So rude! Especially I have 3 kids with me and he didn't bother helping me and yet he helped the other customers."}
{"text":"I  usually get the lau lau from here. Spam musubi is good here too!  I love that they put the Mac salad in separate container. Always call in my order and it's usually ready when I get there! No complaints-been to many locations-food is consistently  great at all locations I've visited."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest restaurant I have been to in years and the food is below average for a Hawaiian background. And to make matters worst they do not honor Military and Law Enforcement discounts. I can't respect companies that do not honor Veterans. 0 stars"}
{"text":"The smell is still pretty nuts.... it is kind off putting..... chicken katsu is pretty good.... however the Musubi is not the best, the nori paper is not the right one and the spam is still kind of mushy.... my family likes to come here so we come...."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again my meat was green  then the cook in the back was mad because I bought it back when he made my food he knew it was green it was right on top in plain sight. I was utterly disgusted never again"}
{"text":"Had to stop by L and L!! I'll be honest I'm not a fan of L and L in Hawaii. But wow! The one in henderson has mean garlic chicken! The ride was perfect, the Mac salad brought back memories of home and the garlic chicken was flavored perfectly. It wasn't too garlicy or sweet! And you know I had to get side French fries!"}
{"text":"I've never had authentc Hawaiian food so I couldn't tell you the authenticity of L&L. BUT, I love their food.

I either get Chicken Katsu \"Mini\" (Quote unquote because mini is still a big portion) or seafood combo. Chicken Katsu mini comes with a lot of chcken katsu (chicken katsu is fried chicken breasts), one scoop of rice, and macaroni salad which is bomb. The sauce for chicken katsu is great, as I've tried to make it at home myself but have failed miserably.

I can't remember exactly what comes in seafood combo, but i believe it was chicken katsu, two fried shrimps, and a piece of fried mahi mahi with two scoops of rice and a whole lot more macaroni salad. All their fried stuffs are very crispy, not too crispy, but little over just the right amount and I like it this way.

I've also gotten their musubi and saimin before. I'm not a huge fan of their saimin. The soup was good, but the noodles were too sticky for my taste. Musubi on the other hand, soo great.

If you can't decide what to for lunch, just stop by L&L. Staff at this location is very friendly, and usually food is prepared pretty fast so you won't have to wait."}
{"text":"I ordered a mini short rib plate for $8.95 and the serving is really small. A scoop of rice is like a half scoop. The short rib is really chewy and nowhere near being tender. My plastic knife won't cut through it. The drink is expensive too and you only get to refill once. It should be all you can drink for that price. MacDonald's is only a buck any size and you can drink as much while you're there. I should've eaten at Grand Kebab and it would've satisfied my hunger."}
{"text":"This place deserves one star only because I'm surprised this establishment is able to operate period! Friendly cashier. Creepy cooks. Dirty bathrooms. Hair in my macaroni salad(really), and short staffed. Who the heck is the manager ? I bet their house looks the same as this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Hawaiian bbq in Las Vegas. The chicken Katsu cannot be beat! The staff is not always so peasant but I look past that because the food is great."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a huge fan of Hawaiian Food, and have enjoyed L& L many years. However, after expanding my taste buds to Hawaii, California and some great Hawaiian food here in the Vegas Valley, I have to say, hmmmmm not bad L& L

a. Location - This one is near the Walmart / Sams Club on Serene just west of Eastern.  Easy location and parking.

b.  Service - Is, not great, but not mediocre. It is just okay. They do not attempt to make a difference or to make it a great experience.

c.  Food - Great overall selection.  We ordered the Katsu and the Beef plate.  The Katsu was quite good and they give you a ton of food. The Mac Salad was just right.  Where they get seriously dinged on the stars is the beef.  Can you remove the fatty tendons that is all over the beef?  You cannot eat this properly because so much sinewy fat is in this beef. It is tough, rough and downright a pain in the but to cut away with a plastic fork and plastic knife in a styrofoam plate.  This is evident to the quality of beef they are using and I would say that all their salty flavorings are covering up the poor meet taste.  However, the texture totally reeks of poor quality.

d.  The bathroom - Why do lock it?  What a pain where your hands are totally greasy from trying to pick apart the fat from the meat. Then we cannot just push our way into the restroom, we have to pick up a key on a long stick, work the lock and get in.  I just want to wash my hands and now I have to wash first to pick up the keys..... Yucky.

Overall, the taste of the flavoring is good, the katsu good, but the beef and the inconvenience of this place overall causes me to give this a 3 star at best.

GK says, gas is still cheap. Keep driving to somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Ordered the spam musibi, unfortunately there was a hair stuck in the rice and spam. Almost threw up..."}
{"text":"Wish i could give this place a negative- 5. Stopped there because it was late and near WALMART.  The condition of the bath room is your best clue as to what to expect of the food.  The chicken was grease bomb,no quality what so ever. Had the runs the next day. I've been to Hawaii ..and this place it's not it. Will never turn !!!!   On a positive side the ice was frozen water."}
{"text":"After having a pretty good experience at the last L & L http://www.yelp.com/biz/t8HbRjam5R1z0hH0I4WajQ?hrid=nX30_xaimagO3kJ_TMQSVQ, I was craving for more of it.  However, instead of going to the S. Maryland Parkway one in Vegas, I was at the N. Stephanie location in Henderson.

As always, I had a regular order of pork lau lau.  It was about $7 and came with two small scoops of rice and one small scoop of mac salad.  The mac salad was creamy and peppery.  Imagine my surprise though to find not one, but TWO pork lau laus in my order!  Wow!  They were already getting four stars just for serving up two of these babies.  In all my years of ordering this stuff, I have never gotten two in a regular order.  (They never offer a mini order of pork lau lau either.)  However, the pork lau lau was a bit watery.  It wasn't dry, thank gawd.  But it lacked flavor.  I had to douse it with a lot of soyu, unfortunately.  They did have a good amount of pork and fatty goodness in there though.

The BF requested a combo with Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  His order cost $7.70.  Upon opening the box, he saw the chicken was a bit darker than he would have preferred, either it's from over-frying it, or old oil.  I think it was from the former because the katsu was really crunchy.  His order was surprisingly large and we both ended up with leftovers.  His short ribs had a distinctive sauce on the ribs, like they put the sauce on top of it after it was cooked.

Cleanliness of the store was an issue here.  Initially, we were seated at a booth and saw this red sauce on the wall.  \"Uh, is that hot sauce?\"   \"Yeah.\"  \"Uh, okay then...let's move.\"  There is hot sauce up on these walls, and dark marks too that I think a good wipe down would take care of.  They obviously have a leak in their ceiling as you can see by the dark water stains from above.  And it's just a bit grimy here.  I don't think anything bothers to clean up the tables or seats here.  

Sidenote: They do offer a weekday lunch special.  For $4.95, you get  a choice of chicken katsu, BBQ chix, or BBQ pork, and it comes with a 16 oz soda, their daily appetizer, rice, and mac salad.

Overall, I give them four stars for the amount of food you're getting for the price.  In terms of quality, that's where the stars go down.  And plus, stuff on the walls should always bring your star mark down too.  Take your order to go so you won't have to see the grime."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about trying out Las Vegas's L& L, especially coming from the Bay Area.  My last few attempts at Hawaiian food in Sin City haven't been the most favorable, so I was in doubt.  I shouldn't have been when it's coming from L & L, after all, they have an award winning \"Best Plate Lunch\", \"Hawaii's #1 Barbecue\", \"Best Chicken Katsu\", and \"Best Local Food\", and there's a reason they continue opening up more of these chain restaurants.

The BF was craving Hawaiian and it was getting closer to 10 pm on a Sunday night.  His only hope was for L & L, as we weren't interested in heading to Aloha Specialties.  We were told that our order was for to go only since it was so late, but we were fine with that.

Searching for my pork lau lau (because that's what I always get), I quickly learned I could only get this order a la carte or with the Kahlua & Lau Lau Combo ($8.50 for regular which includes two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad).  So, a la carte, it costs $3.95.  I added a scoop of rice (60 cents) and a scoop of mac salad (89 cents).    The BF created a combo of his own with Chicken Katsu and the Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  With any regular order, you get a free soda fountain drink too.

My pork lau lau and scoop of rice was shoved into a little box.  It looked disappointing at first.  As I unraveled the ti leaves and revealed my succulent pork and taro leaves, it actually was a heartier portion than I had in mind.  I took a bite and was pleasantly surprised.  It was rather moist and not dry at all, as with many Hawaiian restaurants.  There were nice chunks of pork and its fatty goodness in this dish.  My only complaint was that it wasn't hot enough.  Even the BF was impressed too.

I was pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Katsu as well.  The batter was light and crispy and had a lot of taste.  I found myself reaching over to the BF's plate a lot as I enjoyed his dinner.  The Short Ribs were damn good too.  

Even the mac salad struck a nice chord with me!  It wasn't overly mayonnaisy or too tangy, it was just right!  And the rice wasn't overly sticky or mashy as I've encountered before.  All in all, everything fit so well together in terms of what we ate.

Counter service was okay.  The girl was on her cell phone when we walked in, so that's always tacky.  

Overall, I was very impressed with L & L on South Maryland Parkway!  If I'm craving pork lau lau, chicken katsu, or beef short ribs, you'll find me at this Hawaiian joint!

Update! 03/06/08 - I have since realized that this review was meant for the L & L Hawaiian Barbecue located at Mission Center, 4030 S. Maryland Parkway.  However, Yelp HQ can't move this review w/o having me delete it and repost it.  Oh well.  This review was originally a four though, but now it's a two based on my most recent experience."}
{"text":"These guys were great!! The food is awesome and reasonably priced! Our Salon The Parlor throws an annual pool party every year to just connect outside of work and I have to say this was the first time there was very little food left over! Everyone loved it! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"One random day of errands got me all hungry for some Hawaiian BBQ.  I'm definitely a big fan of Hawaiian BBQ being that it's my heritage. When it comes to L&L, it's a dime a dozen in Hawaii, so I don't tend to visit this restaurant very often.  The franchise set up sometimes makes for an inconsistent experience between locations.

This location is right across the street from a very busy mall in Henderson and around the corner from Sunset Station.  The immediate shopping center includes Hobby Lobby, Target, McDonald's and other shops and restaurants.  This L&L is in it's stand-alone building with ample parking.  The inside is has a bunch of booth seating and a long bench for folks waiting for To-Go orders.  This location is a bit strong with oil smell.  When you walk in, you can tell that a lot of their choices are deep fried and/or greasy.  Most days I'm all about it, this day, I wasn't.  The staff is pretty fast paced.  They kind of  have an expectation that you will know what you want, the minute you enter.  I was kind of turned off by that.  I ordered a plate and was about to order a side dish and they thought I was finished with my order.  

Speaking of orders, I got the Hawaiian BBQ Mix plate and a spam musubi.  Total cost, including tax was $11.46.  The spam musubi is pretty self explanatory.  They don't use a sweet agent like Teriyaki, so it's super salty.  Less rice than other places I'm used to so I appreciate that, as you can taste the spam.  The mix plate includes BBQ beef, chicken and short ribs, rice and macaroni salad.  I really liked the flavor of this dish!  The short ribs were marinated well and everything was nicely grilled!  I was really enjoying the flavor.  So packed with amazing BBQ flavor!  Highly recommended.  

At the end of the day, the location is alright.  I think the BBQ mix plate is what will bring me back.  I do have my favorite Hawaiian BBQ joints, but L&L does offer some great grub.  I'll definitely be back when I'm having another mix plate craving!"}
{"text":"I order for to go here all the time for lunch. The food is awesome. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I like it all. Their ramen burger is to die for. And when I'm feeling a little cold I love their saimen soups. Overall a good place for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I always get the bbq chicken and I absolutely love it..nice size platter for under $10 comes with rice n mac salad ..yummmm"}
{"text":"I paid extra for Kim chi and did not get it in my take out as well as the macaroni salad. When you do not complete an order, you get a bad review.  It is important to check take out orders. There is nothing more annoying than getting home and finding out food you ordered is not in your bag."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food and specifically I love L&L.  While most of them, are of course in Hawaii, they also have a few others scattered around the country.  Some of them franchise locations on the Mainland are better than the others, this location was probably the worst I have been too.  It didn't have the greatest reviews, but when I saw it was nearby I figured I would give it a shot. 

The place was old and run down and felt greasy all over.  The food itself (BBQ Mixed plate) came out looking good and the chicken actually tasted just like it should, but the other beef and ribs tasted like they were cooked in some sort of fish juice or something gross.  I didn't eat more than a bite of them.  If I had stuck with just the chicken perhaps they would have got a higher review, but they ruined it with the mystery flavor of the beef."}
{"text":"This location is very stingy with portion . I've heard from others the owner is very cheap and I'd have to agree because i haven't had this problem at other locations. Seriously 2 pieces of meat in a bowl and two pieces of broccoli and one tiny carrot . I wish i was exaggerating but i'm not . If i wasn't watching what i was eating at the time i would have ordered a plate lunch which comes with more food but we cant always have our cake and eat it too . Wont be coming back here again ."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple nestled in a strip mall here in summerlin yet i never managed to try it until this evening. Go figure. i ordered the BBQ chicken with rice. The rice was nice & sticky the way i like it and i received very generous portions of tasty chicken, so much i could not finish it all. They must be doing something right to have lasted so long here. We discovered a new place to eat! Since my meal was in the evening during the week, there we alot of take out orders. Good food at good prices!"}
{"text":"This place vs Aloha Kitchen.  This place will win everrrry single time.  I LOVE L&L Hawaiian  

Service is always good, prices are normal. I love spam musubi . I've never had a bad meal here.  I've tried several things on their menu and it's always hot and yummy.  Great pork too.  I will go back here any time."}
{"text":"This place is A-ok. If there isnt any other hawaiian place near you and you see L&L it will do. I'm not that big of a fan with their meats it seems like it isnt fresh .. i normally order the mix plate and the chicken katsu.. It's not all that great. The katsu sauce was a bit watery and I asked the girl if this was Katsu sauce?  she said yes and had to look at it twice. I told her katsu sauce isnt suppose to be watery at all she even agreed.  I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone I would only eat here if i had no choice."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of it. I shared a meal and was full when we left. The person who took my order was very helpful with the menu and had no problem giving suggestions on what was popular among the regular patrons."}
{"text":"Being a 9th island girl (Hawai'i to Vegas transplant) I've always been an L&L fan but it's a been a while since I've ate at L&L, not because I don't crave island food but because I've been doing my best to eat healthier. Trying my best. But.... 

I CAVED IN. *Innocent face*. It's easy to cave in when you drive pass this place several times a week and you can smell the savory aroma of Hawaiian BBQ from the street!!!  I've been to this location at least 3 times in the past week! My excuse is, I've been busy moving, so it's great that I can stop in and order a plate lunch after a couple long and exhausting days of moving, without having to search through boxes of stuff for pans and food to cook. 

I like this location A LOT better than the Stephanie location! This is my new go-to spot for L&L. In this review, I'm comparing the Stephanie & Serene locations b/c it's the only Vegas L&Ls I've been to more than once. The Serene location: It's cleaner, the customer service is friendlier (Aloha-style), the food taste fresh and well cooked, the ambiance feels like I'm back home, in the islands. And I'm bound to run into someone I know, which is nice, sometimes ;). The experience I get at this location is what mainland L&L should be, it will not compare to the original Hawai'i L&L, but this location (in my opinion) is up to par. Also, the obvious fact that this location has more people flowing in and out says something. 

I use to go to the Stephanie location a lot but over the pass few years the Stephanie location is not what it use to be. Not a lot of people go to that location anymore since they've built several L&Ls around the Vegas Valley. Here at the Serene location, the staff has good customer service, the location is a perfect spot, the food (especially the BBQ Chicken) taste better here, the food is definitely well cooked and consistent at the Serene location.

I've had almost everything on the L&L menu but at this location I've had the BBQ chicken plate and the Garlic Fish plate.  Both are onoliscious and cooked to perfection.  Mmmm... I'm craving both right now. 

The Garlic Fish is my new personal favorite. A few days ago, was my first time having it at L&L, but it was delicious!! I'm not sure what type of fish it is (see my photo) but I'll ask next time I stop in. The Garlic Fish is grilled with fresh garlic and green onions and comes with slices of lemon to drizzle over when you're ready to scarf in down. ONOLISCIOUS! 

Everything on the menu is drool worthy but If you can't decide what to get.... get the Chicken Katsu, L&L is most famous for their Chicken Katsu (don't forget the Katsu sauce), the BBQ plates (Chicken, Beef, Short Ribs), or my new personal favorite, the Garlic Fish. Each regular plate comes with 2 scoops rice & 1 scoop mac salad. Get the regular plate not mini it's two meals in one (for me it is) and you'll want some leftovers for later. If that's not enough, order an extra plate for later."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here for the awesome food! Every time I come here i leave with a belly satisfied and I come to this one because it's close to my place. UNFORTUNATELY the guy at the register is always rude and has terrible personal hygiene. He's always wearing these nasty old sweat pants and has no customer service skills whatsoever. Get rid of this guy and hire someone with a positive vibe because the food is good! I'm not one write bad reviews but this guy just seems like another lazy stoner behind the register."}
{"text":"Had lunch twice there with my wife.   She always ordered the chicken katsu and I the barbeque chicken.  Never disappoints.  Great taste and very generous."}
{"text":"I walked in and watched the employees make fun of the woman in line; not good. Then when I asked for a menu item that I ALWAYS get, they gave me a weird look and silence. Then I asked again, and they explained that they where the corporate store and all are different. Then I asked them if they had they're signature BBQ sauce and they gave me that awkward look AGAIN. So not a good feeling. We walked right out. I love L&L, but this place was very negative."}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  Just like the ones on island!  I will definitely be back!  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I love this food I can eat it everyday . They always treat you  so good the food is always better than the last time I ate it . They are fast with all the food   . I love the music they play . Lmao it's a great place to eat ."}
{"text":"Great food, but incomparably terrible customer service. Called 3 times & calls went ignored within the last 30 minutes of business. Was attempting to place to-go order, then arrived at the location 10 minutes before close & business doors were locked. They signaled that they were closed with an x (?) - which is not only rude, but unprofessional... ESPECIALLY to loyal customers. If a business posts hours & claims to be open until 10pm, the doors should not be locked and the phones should be answered until 10pm on the dot. Literally disgusted. Step up your customer service; SERIOUSLY."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh only giving it 4 Stars because the customer service is not that great he never smiles and he's rude most of the time always the same cashier"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. I remember when we flipped those game books to play where's Waldo. Didn't realize I was going to play that here except Where's the chicken?. My son loves chicken Katsu, ( its a breaded crispy boneless chicken thigh commonly served in Hawaiian restaurants ) unfortunately, this one does not have any chicken! It should have been called battered katsu. ( refer to photos below) the one star is because the batter was crispy and covered the fact there was a verrrrrrry thin piece of chicken inside there. Yessss I love that crunch. The rice servings was a quarter cup but 2  of 'em you half a cup which for non rice eaters is enough. But if you're from Hawaii ? We love em' white rice. Oh yea, almost forgot they usually served the Macaroni salad in a separate container now it's all just sitting right next to the rice so when you eat your mayo packed macaroni salad here, it warm. Oh yeah baby.  No mahalos to this one..."}
{"text":"Sadly, the quality of their food has gone downhill. The chicken for the chicken katsu was pounded so thin that all I tasted was breading. Come on, chicken thighs aren't that expensive! And the breading was burnt! For $9+ was not worth it. I thought it was a fluke, but it has been the same for the last 3 katsu's I have ordered. Three strikes, I am done with this place!"}
{"text":"I normally get chicken Katsu musuei  and it always comes with extra dipping sauce not only did she yell at my mother and brother that it was already in the bag but when my husband went back she yelled at him even when he offered to buy more sauce she threw one at him saying \"This is all you get\" I have never had such terrible service!!! I will now be making the drive to the eastern location to get my meal correctly  made and not have a lady yell at me for her mistake. 
Terrible terrible  terrible  service!!!! Make the extra trip and get your food with out the attitude."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Authentic, inexpensive Hawaiian food. It's run by some nice people. The store itself is a bit on the low end side, but I don't think it's meant to be fine dining. Great for a quick Chicken Katsu fix."}
{"text":"The restaurant before L&L was a 5 & Diner. The 50's flashback theme diner was affordable with good quality food including their malt shakes. The restaurant lost its consumer base and closed in Las Vegas. In its place L&L Hawaiian Barbecue opened. They decided to keep the left-over booths, chairs, and d√©cor when they opened. L&L says they are a fusion of Asian and American serving a classic plate lunch style meal. 

My first thought of the restaurant was poor, because of the dirty and tacky appearance. Before I ordered I used the restroom and to my surprise it was unkept and filthy. I decided to stay and try to food there. The food was below average and on the dry side. I ended up feeling sick and having to make multiple trips to the restroom."}
{"text":"Their food is disgusting. Nothing like California's l & l. Super salty and my mahi mahi tasted expired. The dude at the cashier was a total douchebag. I was asking a simple question about the spicy chicken and he told me to read description under specialties?! Do yourself a favor and don't come here"}
{"text":"Food is good, it taste the same as the other L&L restaurants I have been to in Las Vegas (this one and centennial location) so if your at this location or another I bet taste is consistent. The place definitely needs to be redecorated, this place used to be a diner."}
{"text":"It's hilarious for people to say that they have to wait so long to get their food. This place isn't McDonald's! They do have to get your food prepped and maybe...if you were a tad bit considerate, they might have other orders ahead of you, including phone orders. People complain too much for their own good. Please get yourself to the nearest fast food joint if you expect your food in less than five minutes. Anyway, I always get exceptional customer service from the hardworking staff. People need to think of how they portray themselves and maybe have a little \"aloha\" in their lives. I'm from Hawaii and the food is bomb! Thank you L&L for satisfying my cravings! Don't let any of these negative comments fool you."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food thats what I love! The guy was very very helpful although you know sometimes you just want a minute to think, that was noexisitant. The chicken is realld good, the ribs were better than okay, but not great. The beef was kinda salty. All in all though great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I love coming into an L&L . Most everything I've tried off the menu is just delicious. The Katsu Chicken I had was tender and perfectly breaded ."}
{"text":"Always a nice place to eat, I like their bbq mix plate. I always order take out with no rice and double Mac salad. I make rice and home and one order feeds family of 4."}
{"text":"I've been to the L&L in Gardena, CA too with my dad years ago, but we stopped at this one for the seafood combo, which is barbecue short ribs [like kalbi], fried shrimp and mahi-mahi. It comes with rice and macaroni salad. Also, they have canned Hawaiian juice that you usually cant find in supermarkets, so I always stock up and 6 cans every time I stop by."}
{"text":"Coming from Florida, we rarely have a good Hawaiian restaurant so every time I'm on the west coast, I always try to find one. L&L was my first Hawaiian restaurant I've been to, and this location does not disappoint. The staff that took my order was very nice and my order came out quick, hot and delicious. No complaints about this place at all."}
{"text":"After a busy grocery shopping outing at Walmart, my tummy was growling and I didnt want to go home and cook. What's the next best thing? L&L! I was right across the shopping center. I made a quick call on my way back to my car and placed my order. I figure by the time I unload and drive over there, the food will be ready! Now thats being efficient!

I order the Loco Moco, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, and two pieces of Spam Musubi. The total cost came out to around $21. The food is very consistent with the other L&L's I've been to. Never a complaint from me. Would I come here again? Definitely. Would I recommend what I ordered? Definitely! You really cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love L&L always have since finding them back when I lived in California. I will say this is probably one of the most consistent in terms of cooking their food. Sometimes I have found other locations to cook their BBQ beef too long and kinda burn it but so far not a single issue with the cooking at this location. Only thing as to why I don't give 5 stars is sometimes the portions are different. Today the regular portion had a lot of food, and well last time the portion seemed a little less. Other than that I love this location."}
{"text":"Ordered roast pork and it was DRY & SALTY!!!!! It looks like it's not ordered often! I wonder how long it's been sitting or actually when it was cooked! If I get sick I'll know why!!disappointing! Definitely not Hawaii quality! Shameful!

We order 3 spam musubi and asked it be individually wrapped. Instead of using plastic wrap they put it in a small paper bag. Definitely not Hawaii quality! Shameful!  Omg.....awful! Worse roast pork I've ever had!!!

I hope the founders Johnson Kam and Eddie Flores, Jr. reads this! If I get sick, I'm gonna report to Departnent of Health!!"}
{"text":"1st time ever here so I tried the BBQ Chicken bowl. It comes with rice & veggies & it was only $4.50! Very fresh & the restaurant was clean. Ill definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"We get take out here once a week.  We call ahead and pick up on the way home from the office.  I get the teriyaki chicken with veggies instead of rice.  This place keeps me on track of my diet when I am on the go and starving for a satisfying meal.  If you are looking for fast food without the calories or the crap give this place a try.  If you are looking for fried Hawaiian food with a little soul, you have also found the right place.  ;)"}
{"text":"-Update: I had to take away a star because my daughter found a piece of metal in her bite of BBQ chicken.  (Posted pic of it). Luckily she wasn't hurt and was able to identify and spit it out.. Although something like this can end way worse!  I called and the situation was handled with grace, which is why I didn't drop them more stars.  I was offered a free meal during my next visit, but they didn't argue when I asked for a refund instead because I probably won't be dining here again anytime soon.  I hope they take this incident serious and address all restaurant and food safety topics with their employees.-

Consistent quality of food!  L&L's will always be a staple in quick, hearty, delicious Hawaiian meals.. This location is a bit small if you're trying to dine in during lunch hours.  The food is always as good as expected and staff are friendly and helpful when you ask for anything.  This is always our go to spot when we want a quick take out order."}
{"text":"There are moments when I love and crave L&L, but there are moments where I can no longer eat L&L.  
However, when I do crave L&L BBQ this place is where it is at! They have such a friendly staff and the food is always out when they promised. They always greet me and one of the staff even remembers who I am when I enter their place. 

Great food & good people."}
{"text":"Large and clean restaurant with fast friendly service.  The kalua pork bowl was just the right amount of food.  So good!"}
{"text":"Yay! They're finally open in the former Shari's Shiny Diner.  Stop in for the grand opening special - buy 1 get 1 50% off, which is also valid for to-go orders.  It's an after thought to most, but their mac salad tastes much much better than other L & L's.  The phone # isn't readily available on yelp or their website yet, so here you go:  (702)869-9898."}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks they give you everything in to go boxes im like what the heck and i couldn't understand a word they said and the bathroom stinks so badly i wanted to cry and DONT get the saimin it tastes horrible"}
{"text":"Got hungry after shopping in the premium outlet mall and we came in to this place because we really didn't want to spend the same money and get express food in the mall. So me and my wife got 2 regular plates with BBQ beef and Katsu they were sooo tasty and cheap. This is one of my best experiences for our trip because we had never tried Hawaiian barbecue back to Oregon."}
{"text":"I have never dealt with anyone in my life like Gabby , she is literally the worst cashier I have ever dealt with I went to ring my card up which is an American Express and the chip did not work so then she told me she could not slide the card whether I asked her how another card would be use she could not answer then when I finally did pay for my food she use another card to slide and I asked her why she could not have just done that in the first place she was very rude to me and offered no consolation afterwards this is the place we have gone to several times and I will never be going to again"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just bad timing but when I walked in there was a customer and the clerk fully engaged in a verbal power struggle. Not sure but the perception didn't resonate well as far as customer service. 
I was ignored  for several minutes until I was then told they were only taking \"To-go\" orders. Moving forward, I place my order and keep it moving towards the door to return minutes later.. Food came out on time and wasn't bad at all, it was really on point. Chicken Katsu and BBQ mix plate. Chicken had decent flavor and wasn't over cooked.. Would I write home about it? Nah, would I return, not sure depends on the mood. It's ok, nothing to rave about. Food saved this rating bc customer service was lacking.."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat the pulled pork & cabbage, or the b-que-beef and chicken mix and just tried the chicken misubi and its pretty amazing.
You also get a side of macaroni salad-no one make it like they do-mild but awesome!  You get two servings of rice also with your food.  ALOT OF FOOD!!!
My daughter introduced us to this place originally and it's yum!
Different kinda menu but you have to try it as it's like nothing else!
Did you know they open at 10 in the morning for those who work early??
YUP!!"}
{"text":"I was just eating at this location and I found a band aid in my food. I immediately took it back and they just looked around and passed it from person to person. Their solution was to offer me more food which I did not want. I reported them immediately to the health district and demanded my money back. I will never eat at an L & L again."}
{"text":"I don't know what they put in their food but I always get so sleepy after eating the takeout from here. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad thing. Lol!

I usually get the Chicken Katsu plate and my boyfriend gets the BBQ Mix plate. Both are quite good and we always get full after eating it. I've ordered their Seafood Mix plate once and I did not like it, I thought it was too salty.

We call ahead and order and it's always ready when we get there, but even if you walk in and order, the wait is never longer than 10 minutes.

They also serve pork buns but a little pricey, imo!"}
{"text":"L&L is like the McDonald's of Hawaiian BBQ you see them everywhere and you just drive right by, we had them in Northern Cali and once we moved here I did not see this one until we went to get groceries at Sams Club with an empty stomach. Instead of getting our groceries and going home to throw down like Bobby Flay we went to L&L for some Katsu Chicken and guess what..... It was exactly like the Cali Locations. 

The staff was friendly and the food was very fast to hit our table. One of the things that L&L does consistently is fill that Styrofoam box to this brim and they do it for cheap. I have never been to Hawaii and I don't walk around saying Maholo to every person that I think has any Hawaiian features or characteristics so I can't write that this meal reminded me of my wild Hawaiian nights when we dug up a pig and broke pineapples on each others chests but I will say that if \"real\" Hawaiian food tastes as good if not better than L&L I may become an Island local someday. 

Back to the portions they give you; first of all, if that is one chicken breast in that tray I would love to see the guy that wrestled that beast to its death  just to be able to cook it up and lay it on the Huge scoops of white rice paired with a side of delicious macaroni salad. To top off this pile of scrumptiousness they have the absolute best teriyaki/BBQ sauce I have ever tasted, as many times as I have tried to buy my own teriyaki sauce it is never like the sauce at L&L it is not too sweet and that is the golden ticket for me. 

Overall this place is great and definitely perfect when you are hungry and in a hurry to get a great meal, and oddly enough when you leave there you may even feel like an honorary Hawaiian and feel the need to say maholo to someone on your way out."}
{"text":"Good place, typical Hawaiian BBQ. Fast, cheap, and tasty, but no frills, and nothing special.  However after being stuck in a casino for 2 weeks it's a welcome change.  To both my taste buds, and my wallet."}
{"text":"I always forget that L & L Hawaiian BBQ is just up the street from where I live.  Maybe, it's because it is hidden toward the back of the mini mall.  We were sitting around my place trying to figure out where to go for lunch.  And, there are only so many burgers you can eat.  So, I suggested L & L.  

So, I took the orders from my clan and off I went.  No one wanted to leave the house because it was \"too hot\" and they were \"too tired\".  Anyhow, I got to the L & L and I was taken care of.  Everyone wanted ribs.  Well, except for one who was against the grain.  He has to get a burger and fries.  But, whatever!

L & L packed up our order, added napkins and plastic ware.  So, I give L & L 5 stars because, the food was tasty and the service was great.  I have said it before, a friendly greeting and a smile goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"This place is always packed!  We've learned to call in with our order -- and CALL IN early especially for the GARLIC Chicken -- because that's not on the menu and they do run out!  :-)  We typically order a BBQ Mix and Garlic Chicken -- and it'll feed 3 of us!  That's how big the portion is!  The Mac Salad is excellent -- and the front of the house staff is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"So came here on a whim with a friend who likes this place and I was excited to try it. The decor here was cool when you walk in it looks like a 50s diner that they bought out and didn't touch. 

Service was normal for any Chinese like restaurant, it's more like fast food style but you can dine in. We got good service nonetheless but in a very rushed fashion.

I enjoyed the random fruit juices they had on offer, but nothing could make up for my disappointment of the food. For a whopping 30 bucks, I got a chicken katsu and short rib meal with white rice and a small macaroni salad. My friend got the mini BBQ combo plate with chicken ribs and beef with white rice and macaroni salad, we both got a soda and gravy fries. To start the ribs were all fat. I hate that so I was grossed out and didn't eat them. The BBQ beef was okay, less fatty but still not great quality meat. The chicken katsu was okay but the chicken is white and greyish brown inside...not sure if the means it's chicken or not?? Also not enough gravy on the fries. 

My overall opinion it was alright but I'm not paying 30 bucks for two people to come eat here ever again...I'll go elsewhere, even fast food places have better quality meat then this place."}
{"text":"I definitely have an addiction to Hawaiian food. They're literally 3 minutes from my house so it's kind of a convenience thing. They're no 808 but they do the trick. I stick with the Kalbi/Katsu plate. I've been getting their lumpia lately and it's hit or miss. The garlic shrimp was overdone the one time I got it. Definitely mediocre. It's like the McDonalds of Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"It's always a hit and miss with this place... Anytime I'm in the area, I always call to see if they have garlic chicken available. When they do I make sure to get a full plate with the sauce on the side because I don't like the chicken to lose its crunch. The chicken which is a boneless thigh with the skin is deep fried and perfectly crispy! The macaroni salad is also good. I enjoy some of the different items on the menu too but my favorite dish is the garlic chicken. I do wish they offered lemon chicken like they do back in Hawaii... I'd be ordering that too! 

Be sure to call in your order if your doing take out so you don't have to wait as long..."}
{"text":"Been going here for years since it's near my house but today will be my last visit. I was trying to find a place to eat for lunch after I got out of class and since I haven't been here in a long time I decided to go and try their Chicken Katsu Curry with Brown Rice.

First off, what's been putting me off of going to this place all the time is how you can taste the oil in the food that gives off this fishy taste and how their katsu can get very crunchy and inedible sometimes.  Today I opened my food and was already disgusted with how it looked. The curry was just splattered all on top of the katsu that it was just drenched in it. I at least like to have some crunch when I eat katsu but the chicken was already soggy by the time I got home to eat it. I did finish the plate since I didn't want to have wasted my money. But as I write this review, I still feel gross after eating it and after reading the other reviews, I feel even more gross knowing how people got food poisoning from their chicken, yuck! 

Also, I agree that their customer service has never been great at all. Today while I was waiting for my to-go order, a lady and her kid came in to order and asked the cashier if he knows when a table will free up. First off, it's first come first serve and it gets pretty packed for lunch time so of course the tables will be filled. But then I heard the cashier point at me while I was waiting for my food in a booth and said, \"Well I know she's leaving so you can take her seat.\" Umm... when did I say I was going to take the food to-go? What if I wanted to stay there? He basically kicked me out my seat and offered it to the other customer. I felt that this was very unprofessional and rude.

You can definitely get better food and better customer service elsewhere. I understand it's cheap but you do get what you pay for if you eat here."}
{"text":"Never tried the food, the smell was so bad upon walking in had to leave. They must have sewage backing up in the building. NEVER going back. 
Sorry, for the bad review but the health dept needs to look into this"}
{"text":"Greasiest, crappiest Hawaiian food around. If you like to eat poo then you should visit L&L."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bento Special plate, with Chicken BBQ, Spam,Mahi etc... but then I saw the Poke Plate (Hawaiian Sashimi) and had to have that. They were very nice to change the order without charging me the difference. They suggested I try it with the Shoyu which was a good suggestion.

Everything was really good, next time will try their other varied dishes."}
{"text":"When needing a little reminder of Oahu, the trip to Mesa to eat some tasty island fare of kahlua pork, rice and mac salad and of course the malolo brand fruit punch brings a smile of satisfaction and content to my face. Now, if only I could hear the waves gently hit the sandy beach and be able to smell the fresh salt air..........."}
{"text":"Is there a shortage of gravy that i am unaware of?? Seriously, a Loco Moco should be smothered with gravy... this is just a travesty.. sad thing is, this is not the first time. I thought when i first had it that it was a one off.. but nope both my husband and i got it a second time months apart and it is the same.. apparently you have to ask for extra gravy.. and hope it is not an extra cost."}
{"text":"Food is always cooked great and cashier is always super nice and patient. I suggest ordering over the phone before you pick up the food or you'll be waiting but it's awesome that it's all freshly made and not just sitting around."}
{"text":"They close at 930 tonight at its 905, all of the chairs are up and over to one side of the restaurant and there are 3 people ahead of me all waiting to get their food also. There is no where to wait for the food as all the chairs are up. I asked the cashier if there were still open and he said \"only for a little\" 

No smile, no thank you no nothing."}
{"text":"It's 8:30pm and they already locked all the doors. I took a picture of the office hours they have on their window and it says office hours til 9pm. I took another photo its now 8:36pm and all their lights are off. So many people are trying to knock but duh, the workers were already ready to go! I hope these workers all get fired. I feel really bad for the people who own this branch. He hired the wrong people. There are so many people who deserve to HAVE A JOB not these lazy ones."}
{"text":"FAVORITE L&L place in Las Vegas thus far! They remodeled this little diner and made it their own. It's different but still cute! 

I always get their chicken katsu, and I love getting it here because they put a lot of chicken! Other places don't even put as much katsu as they do. 

However, I will complain that they don't add enough of the sauce in the little plastic cups :( They're always 1/3 full, and that isn't even enough for all the katsu they give.

Despite that minor complaint, I will always find myself coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I have never been to an L & L prior to me trip here. Usually, I always stopped by their competitor Ohana when I lived in the SF Bay. 

I'd say the food is... it's fine. Nothing to write home about. I'm a huge fan of the beef at these places and not so much the chicken (not Katsu.) The ribs were on par here as with other Hawaiian take out I've had.

Location seems to have waves of people coming through because it's walking distance from 1. a high school 2. a private school 3. a Sam's Club 4. Wal-Mart 5. Home Depot 6. Ross. It's like... every place that has tons of people trucking through is near this L & L. Luckily, because the service is prompt, people get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"I Like L and L my honey HATES it so I eat it when he's not around :) I give it three stars because I got the chicken katsu with curry and I asked them to make it spicy and it seemed like they just put allot more salt and some black pepper in it. It was not spicy. It was still good, but it always gives me a belly ache. But by the next time im craving it I won't remember. I was reading some of the other reviews and maybe it's the MSG that makes you feel that way I don't know but I will still eat here because it tastes good."}
{"text":"This place is one of my local favorites. Although there is a decent sized seating area, I have always taken this to go and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. The only reason this restaurant did not earned five stars from me is because it is not an overly extravagant experience. This is not somewhere you would go out for a fancy meal; however, this is a staple in my weekly rotation of dinners. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food on the menu is great. I've been back twice and had the chicken katsu and BBQ mix plate. The portions are awesome and fit the price perfectly. I always have food to go home. The spam musubi was really good as well. Everyone I take here loves it and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. Its was ok, I will have to try it again. The chicken had a little to much fat and was a little on the soggy side. They need to ask for your name for pick up from the counter. I sat there and heard excuse me sir, and everyone looked at the cashier. Also the fountain drink machine is hidden in the corner, I think it should me moved to a more visable location."}
{"text":"We have had dinner there 8 times over the last 16 days and always received good service.  The food quality was always good and the portions were large.  We have a new favorite meal - the aloha steak.  They also have male and female restrooms which I don't remember seeing in other L&Ls in Hawaii so we normally eat there. I keep looking for beef stew on the menu especially now when its so cold but no luck. We'll be back on our next trip here."}
{"text":"The horrible smell that hit me when I walked in should have been a warning to leave.
The flakey looking kid behind the register couldn't be bothered looking up from his phone to take my order.
Nobody spoke English and there was no manager.
I've been to many L&L locations including four on Oahu and this is the only bad one."}
{"text":"the food is great, the staff is very nice, everything is just so fantastic! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for the better part of a year, and I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner!  Unbelievable!  So delicious!!!  My boyfriend and I stopped by about an hour before our movie at the AMC nearby.  He ordered Chicken Katsu which he was delighted with.  I ordered the Fried Shrimp, and I was most impressed!  The shrimp was so delicious, I could barely stop myself from eating the whole meal, even though I was stuffed!  The macaroni salad is the best I've ever tasted!  I ordered passionfruit juice in a can as well, and it really hit the spot with my dinner!  We also treated ourselves to a little cup of poi, which was authentically delicious, to the best of my knowledge.  The service was fast and friendly, and we will be back again and again for the outstanding food!"}
{"text":"I am from Long Beach, CA, and this was a staple of my diet. When I moved to AZ, I thought L&L was relegated to the attic of my mind. Then I found this spot while incorrectly looking for a lunch spot using 800-GOOG-411 and almost sh*t a brick. I was glad to find that it was almost exactly what I remembered from CA. A few notes; the biz didn't look all that promising, so I'll enjoy it while I can, and I don't recommend any menu items with SPAM in it..."}
{"text":"The food is good if you want something fast and somewhat healthy. Takeout is fast and easy. There's usually only one person at the counter. Sometimes it is a bit difficult to understand her. Food is hot and satisfies my cravings. Call in advance to have the food ready."}
{"text":"Rice was hard and under cooked.  Said something to them about it and they said it was fine.  First off I would like to point out the guy at the counter was Asian and yet he had his head so far in the clouds/ completely delusional.  They obviously don't know how to prepare rice nor do they care.  What a shame I won't be returning to this L&L again unless they get new staff in the future."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing this little fast food-y joint that is fast becoming a regular lunch spot for me.  Good Asian near West Summerlin appears to be a rare commodity and, this modern Hawaiian being a close facsimile to Japanese comfort food in a way, L&L is most welcome.  I have been here 3 times now, and I have not had a bad dish yet.  Everything thus far is more than adequate, and deserving of more than the 3.5 stars it averages on Yelp.

I have had the chicken katsu, fried shrimp, and hamburger steak plates.  They come with rice and pasta salad on the side.  The katsu is crispy and well-cooked, although the meat is a bit thin so they have to be careful not to over-fry.  They do a good job.  The shrimp is appropriately battered, not too much or too little, and perfectly crispy.  The hamburger steak is the real winner, however.  What looks like a couple of regular hamburger patties come full of that Japanese Hamburger Steak flavor, drenched in gravy and all satisfaction.  If you are not familiar with the flavor of Japanese Hamburger steak, it's very distinct from the taste of American burger patties.  Not sure what's in it, probably nothing good, but boy does it taste good.  Bentoss next to Mitsuwa in Costa Mesa is a great example.  The only thing missing here at L&L is a side of kimchi, but this isn't a Korean place so...

The service is on the pleasant side, although I wouldn't say it's gold-star material.  You do have to wait a bit for your food (5-10 min), and while there are plenty of seats it fills up quickly.  This will be my regular spot for lunch, and looking forward to trying a number of other items, including the ramen burger and some of their Hawaiian dishes."}
{"text":"This location of L&L sucks. I ordered a katsu and it was too crispy barley any meat. They charge for extra katsu sauce. The boba taste old. Sorry L&L"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's on the way home from work and the food is great!  I'm going to try something new each time, I'm addicted to the macaroni salad and substitute it for my white rice each time.  The barbeque mixed plate is very tasty as well.  Also, everybody here is really friendly."}
{"text":"We always come here when we're craving Chicken Katsu! Their bbqs are good too! We always get the bbq mix plate substitute chicken bbq to chicken katsu, and everything's good! My kids and I share since they give huge portions. The staff are nice too. Never encountered a rude staff."}
{"text":"This has been a top five quick service restaurant for me and a go to. Its always good simple comfort food. I have never been disapointed and I am here once every few months and the people at the counter always remember me. Service is always fast, even at their busiest. Ive heard that its pretty authentic and cant wait to visit the source one day to compare. I always go for the BBQ chicken they use dark thigh meat and it has the most flavor the skin is always fatty so I never eat it but it really holds in alot of flavor, must try!"}
{"text":"Been to this L&L a few times and its always the same.  Service is pretty good but they could be a little friendlier with some Aloha spirit!  First time I came...tried the BBQ meat which was pretty good but the rice was super hard with not much stickiness to it.  Just seemed like it was a few days old.  Mac salad is good and they serve it in a separate container.  I tried the kim chee fried rice and was not impressed at all.  It was a lot of rice but not much else.  Kim chee had no taste and was soggy like it was old..so they used it for the fried rice.  My friend had a side of kim chee.. big difference.  I guess I gave them a few chances but I will be traveling a bit farther to get better tasting Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I always go to the one on flamingo and have no issues, I went to this one for the first time just now and I walked in at 9:46 the sign says open and online says they're open, And online it says they're open till 10. When I walked in the girl turned and talked to her coworkers in a different language and turned to me and said they were closed. If they close at 9:40 they should have a sign saying they close at 9:40 not 10."}
{"text":"Affordable & familiar ono eats, perfect for us island-born transplants looking for something quick. Friendly staff and cozy diner style seating."}
{"text":"L&L is some of the best cheap eats in town. I mainly go for a quick take out, which they more cater to, of the BBQ beef bowl for $5 but dine in sometimes for lunch. It's never really crowded here in the dining room, and is appointed in the traditional old dinner flare. There's usually only one server to help everyone but she always does a great job during the small rush times. The menu is traditional Hawaiian style of pork, beef, shrimp, rice and of course spam. Everything I've ever tried has been good but what really keeps me coming back is the macaroni salad, it's bar none the best I've ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"Its pretty good. I don't eat out 2 much. I would go back.  Chicken Bowl w/rice is bomb."}
{"text":"Wow, a taste of the islands in the middle of the desert!  I had the mini lau-lau plate and it knocked me out.  Tender and juicy pork hunks are in a perfectly steamed bundle of lau-lau leaves.  The whole thing had been wrapped in ti leaves -- for real.  I did miss the fish, but otherwise, it was excellent.The mini plate comes with steamed rice and a great side of macaroni salad.  My husband had the kalua pork and cabbage mini plate -- a knockout!  GENEROUS serving that was heavy on the pork.  Very good!  We also had sides of Portuguese sausage and chicken katsu.  The katsu was a bit dried out but the sausage was excellent.  We're fans and we'll be back -- and soon."}
{"text":"Hmmm... this is like KFC gone Hawaiian style, and that's not a good thing. My friends love this place and they finally got me to come here... 

Chicken Katsu - dark meat chicken, deep fried... and possibly deep fried again.. served with a side of mayonnaise drenched macaroni salad. The one thing I did like was the sauce they serve you with the chicken. Sweet and sour type with a thick consistency 

Hawaiian short ribs - oh.... well.. what animal did this come from?? This was pretty scary looking to me and I don't think that piece of meat was meant to be eaten.. maybe better to flavor a soup. 

As said before, my friends love this place... Want deep fried crunchiness?? You have come to the right place. For myself, I will stay away."}
{"text":"When you can't decide what you want for dinner l and l is our go to place. Having the bbq mix. Which has bbq chicken beef and short ribs know to locals at kalbi and dont forget the two scoop rice and mac salad. 
One place is good for me and my partner to share with no left overs. 
Always fun to see local people here in vegas.
ALOHA"}
{"text":"huh..... Not the L&L I'm use to in Cali or Phoenix. Maybe it was because of the conditions the employees were in (sadly, their A/C went out) that made their food not quite as good as I expect all L&L places to be. Ordered the same: Kalbi and chicken katsu. Took it to go, obviously hehe. You really cant mess up chicken katsu, which they didnt, phew. Kalbi was not as flavorful nor well done to my desire. Macaroni salad was not as garlicy but yummy nonetheless. Ordered Spam Musubi and there was only one and the spam was more thinly sliced than what I'm use to.They didn't even have the thick teriyaki sauce :( nor the garlic chili sriracha/simbal. Sad to say, I brought my wife to this L&L, her first hawaiian bbq experience and she was not impressed :("}
{"text":"L&L always brings me memories of being crammed in a hotel room while working on costumes --- eating those spam musubis while ironing pretty lacy dresses.  Wait, what?

L&L is a wondrous place.  Prices are great, the portions are abundant, and the food is tasty.    This place is just as good as the one in Lancaster, California.  Actually, it's a million times better!

When I sit at the table, inside this amazing eatery, I like staring at the fake sky.  \"AH... so that's how high my cholesterol is now.\"

Good times."}
{"text":"It's about time I got myself here since it's right near my house. They have so many things to choose from so I plan on coming back a few more times. As it was I got the Chicken Katsu Curry. It was awesome! Tender yet crunchy chicken with just the right amount of curry sauce to flavor but not inundate the chicken chunks. Actually, I think the regular Chicken Katsu without any curry sauce might be a little dry. 

I got the \"mini\" size and I'm glad I did because it was a bunch of food for a solo diner. Next time I'm getting one of the BBQ mixes."}
{"text":"Came here place was dirty and the young man that worked here was sitting on his electronic device (Ipad) at the register for 45 minutes straight....whatever he was doing must've been much more interesting than taking care of the store.

I'll wait to go back to Hawaii if I really want L&L."}
{"text":"Meh... ordered 3 spam musubi.. rice was dry. A little pricey for what it was size wise. I've had way better at other Hawaiian fast food places in the area."}
{"text":"Food portions are huge on the regular plates. Food quality is better than average, though they still need to tweak the flavoring on most dishes I've tried thus far. Its good but nothing really made me drool for more. For the price, it's definitely a place to consider. No other competition anywhere else nearby btw."}
{"text":"The best L&L is the one on Maryland pkwy. Went to the one on Stephanie ordered what I always order and chicken was so salty, mac salad was soggy, rice was dry like it was old. NO Bueno.  Very disappointed :-("}
{"text":"Great quality local Hawaiian food foe a great price. Love the mac salad and Mochiko chicken. Staff seems nice and also has a quiet environment. Definitely going to become a regular Nom Nom spot."}
{"text":"After coming back out of state, I came across L&L Barbeque and wasn't left disappointed with a fairly nice clerk, short wait time and alright food to boot, however, it could've used more flavor on the fish.
The reviews for this place are mostly older and don't reflect this place as it stands today, so I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this location very often, my office was right around the corner. This place is always nice and clean. Very spacious. And customer service is good.

There are plenty of other establishments around this location so you have plenty of food options. But this is definitely the spot! I don't come often just because it's a little out of my way now. I do have a closer one to me but unfortunately I haven't tried it yet. Here's to hoping it's just as good as this one! 

The portions are great for the price, very filling! My favorite is their chicken katsu. Right amount of batter, light and crispy, and the sauce is delicious.
I'm not an expert on Hawaiian food so I couldn't tell you if it's traditional or not, but it's good! 
They have different plate choices with various combinations.. chicken, seafood, beef, etc. Small or large portions, you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is the 2nd time coming to this place and I haven't been disappointed. 
The young lady that works the counter is so nice and very helpful if you've never had Hawaiian food.
The Kalua Pork & Lau Lau was amazing. The pork so tender it just melts in your mouth. 
Don't expect fast food like you would get at BK or other places. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Well I think the food is just ok my buddy thinks it's great. The music is too loud the kid behind the counter was kind of rude and never really seemed smile or be helpful or Pleasant. The music is kind of a techno ballad remix with all sorts of spots in the middle of it just sounding horrible. I think they need an adult to manage the restaurant. I have also eaten at lots of Hawaiian restaurants"}
{"text":"Weekly ritual with the family. My 6 year old gets the spam saimin soup. Husband usually gets regular chicken katsu. I usually indulge in orange chicken combo. I usually spend $15 on all 3 of us. There is new management that has really turned it around!"}
{"text":"The food still good but prices have gone way up, 
Two mini plates and small poki for $26.52."}
{"text":"Our first experience with L & L - and probably our last. 

We ordered teriyaki beef, ribs, chicken - and of course, this all came with macaroni salad and rice (plate lunch - an island staple). It was oh so good when we ate our meal, but later when we got home, our lips were itchy and chapped. We both guzzled down a gallon of water and spent the rest of the evening feeling bloated. 

My family is from Hawaii and I love Hawaiian food - but not if it makes me feel all PMS-y.

Because of my experience here, I'm hesitant to eat at any other L & L location."}
{"text":"We've called since 820, we got there at 845 and your lights are on we called and watched you pick up the phone and hang up, does your manager know you're closing shop 40 minutes before closing time? Extremely horrible service. Still had time to write this review and it's 9 right now. I will be in tomorrow to notify your manager you lock your doors an hour before."}
{"text":"I've tried this place three times but I vow to never go back. I need about a gallon of water after eating there, everything is covered in salt. I got a burger and the entire thing including the fries were covered in grease and tasted like teriyaki sauce, so again way too salty. The service isn't good, the guy doesn't seem to care about customer service and isn't very helpful when you have questions."}
{"text":"Oh, L&L. Heaven in a styrofoam box. The happiest place on earth? For me, when kicking back on a Friday night with my man and a few episodes of Mad Men, it sure is. The staff are friendly and aren't at all shy--if you're new to the joint or just haven't tried many things on the menu, they'll guide you (and give darn good advice). 

A few of my faves: Mixed BBQ plate, Mixed Curry BBQ plate. And I'm a two scoops macaroni, one scoop rice gal. 

Drop by if you're in the neighborhood (or if you're on another planet)--you'll be a regular in no time."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of L & L. I grew up in Hawaii so this food is basically a part of me at this point. Going to L & L is pretty normal for me. 

I came to this specific location with my girlfriend today and it was an absolute mess. The customer service was awful and they made us wait 35 minutes for our food. Maybe I'm just used to great service at other locations, but I've never had customer service this bad in a long time. 

When we showed up, there were two workers there, both very unpleasant. They looked like they had no idea what was happening. After 25 minutes, I walked up and asked if our food was almost finished. His response was ,\"Almost done\" and proceeded to do nothing about the situation. 

I was very disappointed in this particular location and have no plans of ever going back. This is not a hit on the company. I'm really just frustrated with this particular facility and its workers. Can't imagine a more poorly run store than this one."}
{"text":"I used to have L & L Hawaiian BBQ about once a week in California, it was hard to drive past L&L on the way home each day without your craving getting the better of you.  But the food I used to get at the one in Fremont were great.  Their Hawaiian BBQ Chicken was always double if not a triple.  When I went to get some frozen yogurt at Cherry On Top and saw L&L just a short stroll across the parking lot, my mind was set.

After checking out the familiar menu, I went with the BBQ Combo.  The food was prepared quickly and I was out the door in minutes.  The smell was good, and it took some self restraint to not dig in while I drove home.  Unfortunately, the BBQ chicken that has always been a favorite of mine, was no where close to what I was used to getting.  Flavor was dulled, like a number 2 pencil after a hundred questions scantron test.  The BBQ Beef was okay.  The Short Rib likewise was okay, never as good as the ones you grill yourself at a Korean BBQ.  The Mac Salad was the same as what But I hate to think that I have to cross the state line just to get some decent Hawaiian BBQ Chicken from L & L.

Anyway, this location is fairly small.  Not a lot of room to sit and eat, but many take their orders to go.  Location is fairly convenient for those in the SW (near Costco), and parking wasn't an issue.  I just wish the food tasted better.

I would love to rate this L & L Hawaiian BBQ with at least a 3 stars (A-OK), but it just fell short of that mark.  Hopefully it was just an off day for them, but with other better Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in close proximity, I doubt I will give them another shoot."}
{"text":"Although its never my first choice when I am craving Hawaiian food, I still support L&L every once in a while because I'm from Hawaii. My favorite Hawaiian restaurants are far away from where I live, so this place is actually more convenient. What I like most about this location is that it is very clean. Most L&Ls that I have been to in Hawaii and California were kind of ghetto looking. I also like that they are open 7 days a week.

They don't have too many tables in the restaurant, so I usually order to go. My favorite is the Kalua Pork and Lau Lau plate, which are the two Hawaiian food items I miss the most. Unfortunately, they don't taste as good as back home, but sacrifices must be made, right? At least we HAVE Hawaiian food in this city. I also like the Chicken Katsu and the BBQ Mix plates. Portions are generous, I get pretty full with the mini plates. The Spam Musubi is okay. I wish they wouldn't be so stingy with the spam though. There is always too much rice and a thin slice of spam. I'm not a good cook at all, but even I make better Spam Musubis at home, LOL. Also, don't order the saimin because the broth has no flavor at all. Trust me, you are better off making instant ramen at home!

Customer service here has improved a lot. One of the reasons why I didn't like coming here in the past was because the cashiers were very rude. No \"hello\" or \"thank you\" ever. Just a \"Can I take your order?\" However, the cashiers are now much more friendly. The wait times for the food is pretty short and reasonable. The one thing I don't agree with is that they don't always give you sauce for the Katsu unless you ask. Seriously?! Why would I NOT want sauce with my Katsu? 

I'll be back sooner or later!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the food! I'm not gonna lie I was a little skeptical but the bbq beef was so flavorful and they gave us a good amount! The staff was very friendly and attentive! The reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 is the macaroni salad was really really bad.. it was just noodles and mayonnaise which is a shame because I love macaroni salad but everything els was really good!"}
{"text":"I love there food. Big portion sizes and this is how I get my Hawaiian food crave. There are three plates I always get from this place they're katsu, bbq chicken, and loco moco."}
{"text":"Amazing food like always, always get the number 4 chicken katsus or the number 3 with their ribs. Delicious, always come here especially since it's right around the corner. As far as finding the store is a little difficult."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of L&L, but they get you by in a pinch when you're craving Hawaiian food. 

On a recent visit for lunch my fella and I found ourselves at L&L and decided to share two plates. We went with the garlic chicken and the kalbi. Service was decent and our meals were brought out to us quickly despite being pretty busy during the lunch rush. 

The garlic chicken was intensely garlicky. Dare I say too garlicky and the kalbi was overcooked and dry. I didn't love anything I ate here. 

The shop is pretty small but there are a decent amount of tables inside. 

I'm not in any hurry to come back, but like I said, it's convenient when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"Good seafood mix with bbq beef. 3 breaded shrimp, battered bass fish, an d perfectly cooked bbq beef. With Mac salad. Yum. Employees friendly."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! An L&L I can go to and not be disappointed. I don't know what it is but their food reminds me of the local spots back home. Plus the people are super nice. There's an older gentleman who cooks in the back that came out to give my little girl and another little girl yam yams! So thoughtful and the guy behind the counter that helped us was friendly and helped my bf choose a plate since it was his first time. They maintained the restaurant very well. i can't complain and will likely be back since I frequent the Costco located in back of it

Much mahaloz!"}
{"text":"I love their musubi, the katsu one! The combined crunchiness and juciness of the katsu works well with rice and the seaweed wrap. Tip: add the sriracha sauce for that exciting hot flavor! I've eaten here once and the place is ok plus the price is just right so I'm giving a 4."}
{"text":"Staff wasn't very friendly and the food was not traditional L&L type food. Not worth the money and I was disappointed over all"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short.

The loco moco was absolutely disgusting (and I LOVE loco moco).  The hamburger had obviously been frozen in its lifetime, the gravy was flavorless, and even my sunny side up egg didn't taste good (how do you mess that up?).

I also ordered a spam musubi (again, I LOVE spam musubi), and that again was really lacking in flavor.

The only thing I actually ended up eating was the side macaroni salad.  I tossed everything else after a couple bites. :( That goes to say how sad my meal was."}
{"text":"Their food made me and my brother sick... don't recommend it unless you want to risk it.."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a simple healthier meal that is fast, L & L has you covered. They have great BBQ Chicken and pork. Oh and spam! 

You can call ahead and just pick up your order to go too."}
