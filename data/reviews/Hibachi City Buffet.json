{"text":"The prices are affordable but flavors arent to par with other Chinese places here in Laveen. The staff is amazing and and very attentive. Will i go back? yes"}
{"text":"Food was cold or lukewarm.  Anything beef related was a disaster.   Placed noodles and my  to be stir fried for me they took 10 minutes to actually pick it up then slipped it to the kitchen where they replaced it with their pre made noodles which are not very good which is why I waited to have my own selection.  Mine didn't have onions or cabbage like the ones they brought me.  Sushi is passable and sometimes the have oysters on ice.  The crab casserole is pretty good along with the steamed clams with cheese.  Don't waste you money on drinks they are always watered down and never have ice.  Go with just water. It's a hit or miss with this place."}
{"text":"Good food, good price and always stocked. Been here about a dozen times this year already. It is nice to have a buffet restaurant in Laveen."}
{"text":"Comparable to other Chinese buffets I've been to. The price is good, I would have spend just as much at fast food. The beef and broccoli and coconut shrimp were both good. It was clean and service was fine."}
{"text":"Took a waiter 25 minutes to refill our drinks and literally only 8 other costumers in this place! I get why no one comes here this has to be the most horrid place!!!  They really needa shut this place down if they are not about their costumers !!! I wish i could give ZERO STARS !!!!! Food was either undercooked or freaking burnt just super disappointed in this \"GRAND OPENING \" THEY should put \"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS\""}
{"text":"No.  I have this place one star for being open. And one star for having hot food.  When we walked in the greeter just blankly stared at us like we were supposed to say the secret password. Finally got seated without this or any other person muttering once sentence to us.  My pink lemonade lasted wierd and the glass had a couple of small pieces of ice on a hot az summer day. By the time the drink got to me the ice was almost completely melted. The food was wierd but there were a couple of things that were fresh (spring rolls, mashed potatoes, teriyaki chicken, general tao, lime wedges), but there were other items not so fresh (fried rice, lychee, fries, nuggets, vegetables).  BOTTOM LINE: I don't like my drinks with NO ICE, I don't appreciate people ignoring my business until it's time for me to pay then trying to appease me by making small talk, the whole ambiance was wierd, and there were too many red flags and items that were not fresh that I will NEVER be going back.   The only thing I liked was the price and I probably wouldn't have paid a penny more to be there."}
{"text":"Lack luster selection, items look old and feel cold, and it made me sick. I only gave 2 stars because they have a decent selection of sushi even though I didn't try it."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation\" where Eddie takes Clark to the \"Best Buck 49 Buffet in Town\"  It was only 7 pm, place was more than half empty. Shame for the area and a Friday night since dining in Laveen is still limited.   Nothing was being replenished, no one at the BBQ grill where the neon sign was flashing. Not one beef entree, half the tags of what it was were missing or wrong.   Server only returned once to collect plates, never for any refills.   Sign when you leave is humorous, Free Meal on Your Birthday. Followed by Free meal on your birthday if you bring six guests. You could offer me free meal for me and my six guests, no thank you!"}
{"text":"The food here is very gross I will never go back nor do I recommend it the food is not fresh and the dishes are not clean I have been to many buffets during my lifetime this is by far the worst"}
{"text":"it's second time I'm here with my wife, we love the food here, and it's nice clean here. Highly recommend this buffet! Love it a lot, definitely we will come back again!"}
