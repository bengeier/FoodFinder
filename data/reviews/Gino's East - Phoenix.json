{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time. Three of us showed up for an early dinner (around 5pm). We self parked and were immediately greeted and seated. The service was great, no complaints there. The Cesar salad was fine but the deep dish pizza was just not good. The sauce and cheese ratio was ok but the crust had a weird smell and taste (too yeasty maybe?). Maybe this is what it's supposed to taste like but it was not good in my opinion. I wish I could give this place more stars but the pizza did not impress. My son enjoyed writing on the wall."}
{"text":"The pizza was similar to frozen pizza. Nothing memorable. And, I gave the waiter $20 to add to the bill and he took it as a tip and said thanks. Won't be going back. If you want real pizza in from Chicago go to Uno's! Or pizza Bianco here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place will not make it with the horrific soggy crusted paperweight that we got last night, Sauce spilling off the pizza in fact I could of made another pizza with all the extra sauce...We are born and raised chicagoans that love our food but this isn't even remotely the same as Gino's east back in Illinois and Gino's was never my first choice as there are many others that are far superior but it was always totally acceptable. In short I will not ever go back to any Gino's again after the garbage they are slinging especially when there are so many other choices here in Phoenix and I'd suggest the one called Lou Malnatis it's on camelback and central and it's completely legitimate Chicago deep dish and if your looking for thin crust try Spinatos"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of deep-dish pizza, but the sauce was amazing!  Other than that,  the pizza was just alright.  We got the Chicago fire, which was supposed to be spicy but sadly was not, and the all-meat pizza (I forgot the exact name...), which had an unexpected smoky flavor (the Canadian bacon probably). Personally, the food wasn't worth the 1 hour,  45 minute wait. We went for an early Sunday dinner; I can't even imagine what a Friday or Saturday night wait would be like!"}
{"text":"Gino's is a great place with excellent pizza and sandwiches.  The service was wonderful.  Definitely would recommend this restaurant for casual dining and good food."}
{"text":"My experience at Gino's East was fantastic. Was there to celebrate my friend's bday party and we sat at the patio for happy hour and live music. The pizza, food and atmosphere were just perfect. The manager, Ryan, was attentive and welcoming. Our waiter, Justin, was professional, friendly and efficient. Can't wait to go back for another great experience."}
{"text":"We were told the wait was 1 hr. but we were seated in 30 mins. The atmosphere was nice & staff very friendly! Tyler, our server was very attentive & personable. We will definitely request him again. Thin crust pizza, wings & hummus was awesome! Our overall experience at Gino's East was amazing & I'll definitely be back with family & friends!"}
{"text":"Sought ought Gino's to compare with other deep dish pizza places in town. Not disappointed. I've eaten at the original on the north side of Chicago many times, so I was a fan gaining in.  The food was the same great pizza I remembered. Had a deep dish medium half pepperoni half sausage (patty style of course). Great cornmeal crust, good crisp to the crust, great cheese and sweet tomato sauce. All in all it was exactly what I remembered and made me wonder why we waited to visit.         The only real difference I could see to the Chicago location was that the staff  (Ricky Bobby B) here in Phoenix was super friendly, helpful, attentive and available. Layout of the restaurant may not have the character of the old north side spot, but what it may lack in quirky character it makes up for in cleanliness. Tables were super clean / not grimy, bathrooms were bright and also very clean.   Overall, again,  the food was really really good, the bruschetta was great with super fresh basil leaves, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. And the 312 beer from Chi town is a must."}
{"text":"Chicago's BEST  After going to Chicago for some on-hand pizza training, Gino's East in Phoenix has now become, once again, one of THE BEST places for deep dish pizza!!!  Believe me, I am from Chicago and am quite familiar with just about all the places in the City and nearby neighborhoods that have deep dish pizza.  Gino's is now nearly just like the original on Superior St. in downtown Chicago!!!  What makes them the difference from everyone else is their delicious, yummy crust.  As a matter of fact, the first thing I do when my slice is on the plate is go right to the back and cut the crust off and eat it first; it's scrumptious!!!  If you've tried it before and did not like it, I dare you to go back and stop with just 2 slices; you won't be disappointed with either the pizza, the ambiance or the staff including GREAT management!!!!!!!!  Remember, you need to order the ORIGINAL DEEP DISH; not the lunch special or any other form; go for THE BEST and you won't be disappointed and you will be leaving rave and honest reviews similar to this.  Believe me, being a Yelp member for years, I have given some places 1 star because you can't do zero; I am blunt and crass at times, but always give my fair and honest opinion(s)!!!  THANKS for taking time for reading the review; again, you won't be disappointed!!!!  //Steve"}
{"text":"The real Gino's East is amazing. This isn't even a reasonable facsimile. I went twice in the holes that the first time was a fluke, but both times were awful, even when I offered to pay for extra cheese. Just buy a frozen pie at AJ's.  It's closer to the real deal."}
{"text":"Never got a chance to try, empty parking lot, valet parking only, I don't do valet parking!  Will go to Costco and get a pizza"}
{"text":"We went to Gino's East for dinner on a Thursday night. There was no wait and we were seated immediately which i was surprised because we had tried go before and the wait was over an hour. Our server was very helpful. He told us upfront that the deep dish would take 45 minutes. We ordered an appetizer, which came out in a timely manner and the deep dish pizza. I don't normally get deep dish, but because it is an authentic Chicago style restaurant we figured we would. I enjoyed it. I thought the sauce was very good and the XL was plenty for 3 of us with leftovers. My only complaint would have to be their wine pours. I ordered 2 glasses of wine and for $10+ a glass I expect the glass to be at least somewhat close to halfway full, but they weren't either time. I switched to beer after that.  Overall I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Great feel and yummy pizza. The spinach dip is great and I'm happy hour! Skyler was friendly and attentive. The decor is so fun! Love it :-)"}
{"text":"We had a private party for a group of about 25 at Gino's east. It worked our perfectly. They have a private room that easily accommodated our group. We had the option of a preset menu or being able to order off the menu. We chose the latter and people appreciated being able to order their favorites.  What was nice was that besides pizza they had a zucchini noodle dish for a dieting GF friend, nice salads to enjoy as we waited for the pizzas to bake, lots of wine options, beer, and mixed drinks too.  I love their deep dish pizza and totally enjoyed my deep dish with sausage.  When the food arrived it was piping hot and fresh.   As we waited for our meals, we got to write on the walls, just like the original Gino's east in Chicago.  There are also lots of tv's around so you won't miss your favorite game while you dine.  I also love to look at the photos around the restaurant. If you are from Chicago, this place will really remind you at home.   Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our glasses were filled, offered ideas on what and how to order our meals so we got it exactly as we wanted.  He made sure the kids joining us got their meals quickly. When we were done he made sure everyone got the right pizza boxes to take home.   All in all, I would not hesitate to schedule another party at Gino's east.  I could not have asked for a better venue."}
{"text":"Having been to the Gino's in Chicago, I thought I would try the one that opened in Phoenix, the food is what I remembered, I tried the deep dish pizza and it did not disappoint, it was a safe choice, I also had the buffalo wings which were decent as well. I do not like the valet only parking that they use, not a big fan of letting other people drive my car, it is also not a place to go if You have any type of time constraint, because of the logistics of the place, you're going to want to block out at least a couple hours if not longer when busy, especially if ordering a deep dish pizza. I would give it 3 stars for those reasons, food good, set up and wait times not so good."}
{"text":"My first impression was not the greatest. First, the parking lot was pretty empty for being lunch time. They sat us right away since there weren't a lot of people (hence the empty lot). Received our drinks fairly quick but then the wait started. Evetually I had to waive the waiter down, who was chit chatting with the hostess, to take our order. Next we were told deep dish pizza takes 45 min to an hour, and a thin pizza 35 min. That's no good if you're on lunch break so we had to skip the pizza. We ordered the Chicago dog and the Italian beef sandwich. Waited about 20-25 min to get our food. The sandwich was more like a french dip with the beef au jus you get with it. It also said it comes with peppers but all i got were three little grilled red peppers. It was pretty bland. Side Caesar was average. The dog and fries were ok. Seeing how slow the waiter was moving we flagged him down, while we were still eating to ask that he bring us the bill, so we could leave quickly since we had to get back to work. The guys at the table next to us had to settle for the dogs as well cause they also couldn't wait for pizza. I wouldn't recommend coming here for lunch. Not sure I'd go out of my way to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened in translation from Chicago to here. Definitely not the Chicago Gino's recipe, or have the deep dish pans not had enough time to be seasoned, or is it the Phoenix water? My favorite pizza was a liquid tomato sauce, sloppily put together, not enough sausage, maybe one or two pieces per slice. The crust was lacking along with the lost sausage.  The interior is badly set up with the wait staff set up area right over the heads of people sitting in booths. I asked the wait staff about this and they said they had also expressed concern to their management about the setup and were hoping it would be changed. Gino's you would get a lower score if it wasn't for your excellent staff. For the amount Gino's charges for a little taste of home, they can do so much better. Fix the prep, fix the ingredients, don't be so cheap about the sausage or the 6 pieces of spinach I got on my MEDIUM . What is that about 5 cents worth of spinach-and how much does Gino's add for extra ingredients? Oh and fix the parking - there's not enough room even during slow times of day.  Oh don't order a  cocktail, they don't seem to be able to make them very well. Stick to beer or wine."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with our three children checked out Gino's East last night for dinner.  The wait was an hour which we were prepared for.  We were greeted at the door and were advised that we could sit out on the patio while we wait for our table.  We immediately found a table and listened to a live band.  The one issue we had was we could not order appetizers.  We were told we could only order drinks. I was perplexed on that.  In addition they had no severs working the patio.  So if we wanted another drink we had to ask the bartender ourselves.  The bar was packed so at one point and I wanted another glass of wine but saw the line and thought it wasn't worth it.  The restaurant could me making more money is my point.  After an hour we were escorted to our table where we quickly ordered soft drinks and appetizers.  This is where it got interesting.  Our food came out before our drinks.... when the kids mentioned they were thirsty and when we couldn't find our waiter we had to hunt another one down where she apologized and our grabbed our drinks immediately.  We saw our waiter once in approximately 25 mins.  He never came back to ask if we got our appetizer or to check on our drinks.  After that we waited an additional 45 mins for the pizza. The pizza was amazing and the appetizers and salad did not disappoint. I think the downfall of anything will be the  service at this restaurant.  My husband and I have lived in Arcadia for 12 years now.  Theres is a wide selection of restaurants and word spreads fast about service and food.  I would suggest that management button up on the customer service.  It's unfortunate but the service really killed it for us on this restaurant... food and sauce was amazing though!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago and I've recently relocated to Atlanta. I am ALWAYS homesick for the food. Gino's East is my FAVORITE pizza! So when I saw the advertisement in the airport, I immediately plugged in the address. All I can say is SPOT ON! It taste JUST like home! Not to mention the service is SPECTACULAR!!! Madison takes care of me every time! She is VERY helpful and inviting! Nothing like a friendly face in an unfamiliar place coupled along with the BEST pizza on earth! IWILL make  his stop every time I come to town! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazingly helpful manager!  Thanks to his help we were able to have the frozen deep dish pizzas delivered to the Phoenix Airport by GrubHub.  We live in San Diego and are so grateful to Jordan, the Corporate Manager, who helped us take this Chicago staple home with us."}
{"text":"When your server begins by telling you that the quality of the pizza \"taste a little different\" because of \"Arizona water\", you know the pie is gonna suck.  As predicted, the pie sucked.  Rosati's Scottsdale, and Malnati's, figured it out.  \"Arizona water\" should never be a crutch.  Give people quality Chicago pie, or close your doors cuz you are no better than the rest of them.    Service was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, i really loved the deep dish supreme !!! The calamari and mozzarella sticks were fantastic !!! Will be back soon !!!"}
{"text":"Wow first time here and it blew me away! Thin airy crust amazing! We got the supreme thin crust XLarge!"}
{"text":"Do not order Gino's East pizza from Door Dash. They will not deliver your pizza unless the driver has a warmer bag. If you go to Gino's East and have to speak to the manager on duty Courtney she has no customer service skills. I asked them to release my order and she proceeded to talk over me. I say no to Gino's East and stick with Oreganos - they rock! #doordashfannotginos"}
{"text":"Our server Regina was absolutely AMAZING. This was our first time eating at this restaurant and she made our visit wonderful. The food and service was spectacular. The pizza taste just like downtown Chicago's!!"}
{"text":"Great food even better service! Regina takes great care of her customers! Had a wonderful time will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"After my initial visit with a surprisingly watery \"Eat your Vegetables\" Pie, Gino's nailed it on our second visit with a delicious Chi-Talian Stallion Pie and a deep dish Sausage! The service was very attentive and friendly. We'll be back to get our Chicago Pie fix!  Keep up the good work, Eric"}
{"text":"Went there Today for the first time. Short wait up front; just few minutes. I ordered some water and get a dirty cup. I have the waiter switch it out (strike one). We order a deep dish with Calamari for an appetizer. Calamari was alright. The place wasn't packed where we were sitting; about four empty tables. It was fun to write our names on the wall. Waiter waited until drinks went dry until he would eventually swing around and give refills (strike two). Pizza comes out after a 45+ minute wait, buuuut they don't know who's pizza it is nor do they know what kind of pizza it is (strike three). Server makes rounds to all tables asking if anyone ordered a pizza with jalapenos. Well, we ordered a Chi-talian pizza so we were one of many who said nope..not us. Turns out, it was our pizza. Great! thank you for letting everyone in the room stick their face in it. (strike four). We're ready to box leftovers and we have to wait and wait and wait. Our wait was so long that all the other tables had been filled, fed, boxed and billed before we even got a box. We decided ahead of time that we would order dessert...(at this point we're just glutton for punishment). The waiter takes our plates and says he'll be right back for our order. Yup, another 15-20 minutes of our lives....wasted...waiting for this guy. He comes back and we order Tiramisu. He says he's going to put our order in right away. 10-15 minutes later comes back and says they don't have Tiramisu (Good Grief!!). He offers pie (most expensive dessert on the menu). After much thought, my guest says he will have pie. The waiter walks off. Forgot about my order being not available. So, I got to stare at my guest eat dessert while I held onto an empty cup :(   .  oh, we also had watery coke with our pizza. Tried calling four times shortly after we left because I was upset about the experience, but the phone line was busy."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago and have waited 20 years for Gino's East to open in Phoenix.  Our family just moved to Arcadia so the new location is perfect for us.  We arrived one hour before the grand opening and were the 6th group to be seated.  It was fun and effortless!   Hostess---excellent Waitress---excellent Management---excellent (they all came by our table and said hello) Drinks---excellent Pizza----excellent, DELICIOUS and the REAL DEAL!!!    A slice of Chicago pizza heaven in Phoenix...almost as good as the Cubs winning the World Series!  :-)  Welcome to the Arcadia neighborhood Gino's East!"}
{"text":"Chicago natives we drove in from the east valley to an anticipated great pizza. We ordered one deep dish and one thin crust. We knew from experience that the wait for the deep dish would be a while so ordered salads to curb the appetite. The deep dish was deep but tasteless. The thin crust pizza was wholly unremarkable in taste and not thin. It had a crust as hard as a rock. The sausage on the deep dish pizza was very limited and hard to find under the extensive tomato sauce. Nothing very tasteful about the experience except for our excellent waiter JAKE who did provide great service. Wine is overpriced for this establishment and beer was average priced for the areA."}
{"text":"Being fortunate to discover deep dish pizza long ago at Gino's East restaurants back in the Chicago area, I'm truly sad to say that my highly-anticipated experience at the new Phoenix location was very underwhelming. The PHX deep dish was nowhere near the original Chicago experience that I so longed to recreate. It wasn't that the pizza was poor - it was just OK. Definitely not worth the premium price. I was expecting a lot more. From the runny sauce, lack of cheese, and a relatively unexciting crust - not sure I would ever consider this deep dish as a \"Windy City Original\". Again - the pizza was not bad; it just wasn't the pizza that I have continued to brag to others about since the announcement of the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Went to Gino's to watch the diamondbacks on the patio with friends.  Great food, great service! The owner came and introduced herself, bartender delivered shots... super fun night!!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!  Be prepared for close to 40 mins to be seated during peak hours and another 45 mins to an hour for their famous deep dish pizza. Fortunately the service, atmosphere and live entertainment on the weekend will keep you busy while you wait. We ordered a large deep dish (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and spinach) which was more than plenty for 3. Kelsey, our server, went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of. Also, be sure to bring a colorful array of permanent markers so you can leave your mark on any available wall space."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the original Gino's East in Chicago and it was the best pizza I have ever eaten. I was so excited when I heard that they were opening a location here in Phoenix. Unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. The service wasn't great and the pizza was tasteless. I was shocked at how bland it was and was embarrassed because I had hyped it up and brought several friends with me and none of them enjoyed it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We had Gino's East delivered to the office today, holy moly that was good! I would highly recommend and I will be coming down in person. If delivery was that good, I can only imagine what dine-in will be."}
{"text":"From Chicago so finding great pizza can be a challenge! Well look no further. Ordered the Chicago style cheese and it did not disappoint! The service from Danielle, iconic pictures of Chi Town coupled with great conversation with the GM make this a must visit if you are a pizza snob!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago isn't part of my life, so my review is based on what I found to be a great restaurant. It is a nice, vibrant, and clean place that seems very family and \"kid\" friendly. The pizza, and minestrone soup, was delicious. My server's name was Lacey. She did a great job - handling many tables at once. Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is really bad pizza.  It's barely better than Frozen pizza quality.  I don't understand what the big deal is about this place.  The best pizza in Arcadia is a few doors down at My slice of the Pie."}
{"text":"This Chicago Deep Pizza is fair/average at best. Crust is dry and tastes bland. The sauce had a strong green pepper taste which I wasn't a fan of. Not worth paying that much $ for mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekend lunch. The service and food were excellent. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The first time we came here it was mid-week for lunch and we ordered the lunch special. I believe it was a mini pizza, salad and drink for $8. The salad was good and the price point for the deal was right but sadly the pizzas were disappointing. Because of how small they are it felt like they were all crust and unfortunately the crust just isn't that good.  The second time around we called ahead and pre-ordered a medium meaty legend pizza. I was told it would take 45 minutes to bake. We arrived 10-15 minutes after I called in the order and were seated immediately. The pizza didn't come out until 45 minutes after we sat down.  This time around we enjoyed having more of the deep dish cheesy goodness to enjoy but by the time we were done there was a pile of crusts that we didn't want to eat. It's kind of sad that a place that specializes in deep dish pizza doesn't even have a crust that's enjoyable.  Both servers we had were great although it seems like they're stretched a bit thin. It will be a while before I feel like giving Gino's another shot."}
{"text":"The food was great. No question. Service needs work. Spent almost $100 on food alone. Much much more is expected.  Biggest complaint, we got our bill and one person in our party was paying cash.  The other person and I were paying by card. Our friend is in from out of town and ended up with a fraud prevention hold on her card. The server didn't even ask if she wanted to use another card, instead, he just ran my card for the remaining amount. Not cool. Management didn't take any other action except for an apology.   Other service issues include not getting refills on water and not being asked about dessert  We really wanted the Pie Snob pie that they offered because it's awesome!  Guess we'll just have to go to Pie Snob for that directly seeing as how we'll never be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Gino's East and we were not disappointed! Deep dish takes 45 mins to bake, so we got started on some heavy apps. The jumbo wings had a nice delicate sauce. Not too spicy, but lots of flavor! The Vienna Beef sandwich had thinly sliced roast beef, a super tasty au jus that could've drank out of the container and Italian spicy veggies that were so good we had to ask for seconds to put on our pizza. Our last app was the buffalo Mac n cheese!! So good! Eat it fast or it gets kinda greasy. To top it off, our server Monica was attentive and offered great suggestions.. i.e. Putting the veggie mix on our pizza and joining the Gino's rewards to get $5 off your first order. Thanks the great experience!!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try Gino's East out. The atmosphere was ok, definitely not Hazelwoods!  Miss the charm and personality of Hazelwoods and the friendly staff. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and wanted to try the deep dish people but we were told it would take an hour for the deep dish, 30 minutes for the thin crust. The dip was not that great and took about 30 minutes just to get that. About 45 minutes we finally got our pizza and we it was just ok. Don't understand why it takes that long to make a pizza and an average pizza at that. I could see if they are packed and the pizza was incredible but neither were the case. Really disappointed with everything. Not sure it's worth a second chance - will see."}
{"text":"Ok you wanted feedback on Gino's East Chicago pizza, at the old Hazelwoods location. My husband and I aren't  deep dish people but, because they're famous for it, we gave it a try. It was amazing. It wasn't too rich or salty. We had the Meaty Legend. The crust was like nothing I've ever seen or tasted. I can't explain it. We also tried the calamari and it was great. Great drink menu with lots craft beers and restaurant neighbor \"Ohso's\" own #Liquor.  Our waitress Angie was amazing. Oh and some familiar faces work there...a few former Hazelwood ladies!"}
{"text":"Finally one of these places in Chicago's actually good Sai order they have veggie half Italian beef which I wasn't too sure about but I love Italian beef I was super surprised to how good it was just the beef and the peppers with the vinegar with the cheese and sauce is Blended perfectly the veggie side was okay nothing special next time I'll definitely get the whole Italian beef Pizza just writing this right now wants me to go get another one of those pizzas had it on thin crust too like all the other Chicago places it takes 30 to 40 minutes for your pizza so make sure you're not starving when you go sat at the bar she was okay not real friendly but was able to answer all the questions I needed so what recommend this older other to Chicago places now here in town"}
{"text":"Great pizza and love the atmosphere. Comfortable environment, good music and good customer service. Quiet on an early Sunday afternoon. We will definitely be back again for more pizza!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Gino's East having eaten at their pizzeria in Chicago a number of times.  We went with friends on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately.  On a Saturday night in Arcadia, that was a surprise.  Our waiter was engaging but a little too cliche - called himself Bobby Boucher and used an accent more reminiscent of Jersey than Chicago.  They had a good wine list; I ordered a California Rose that was delicious, but for $13, it better have been.  My husband had a Chicago-brewed craft beer and it was delicious, too.  I think the 312.  Really good.  We ordered a family-size Cesar Salad that was nothing to write home about.  It could have been a grocery store bag salad for all I knew but at least the lettuce was fresh.  The pizza was deep dish so it took almost an hour to prepare and was disappointing.  Too much sauce, rubbery cheese, forgettable crust.  We had a great time with our friends but probably won't make a point of going back any time soon given the hefty check and average food.  I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Fantastic deep dish!  Loved Gino's East in Chicago and now love it here!  Caesar salad was really good and the deep dish was perfection!  Service was superior!  Staff were tremendous. Great positive attitude and customer attention. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Two words - Very disappointing. I came to Gino's with my family hoping to experience some delicious pizza and great service given all the hype we had heard. We called ahead to find out the wait and the hostess was extremely polite and pleasant. Upon arrival we were greeted promptly and the hostesses were super friendly and kind. We waited for over a half an hour and were finally seated. This is where things for Gino's went south.   We weren't initially greeted by anyone for several minutes after sitting down. Then a server finally came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. The server also told us that she was not going to be our server but was helping out to get drink orders started. About 10 minutes later all the drinks except for my beer arrive. Almost 10 minutes after that my beer finally arrives. Mind you we still haven't seen our REAL server to order food. Finally another server comes over, obviously overwhelmed, and takes our order. Our order finally comes out and is very bland. Actually, the soup wasn't bland, I liked the soup. Everything else was of subpar flavor. Then trying to close out our tab was like asking for someone's first born child. THREE servers had been by and spoken with us and when we asked if we could get our check, ALL THREE told us they weren't our server and would try to find our server. Getting a box was another endeavor that apparently was very difficult so after waiting several minutes we helped ourselves to the boxes that were 6 FEET AWAY next to the servers' computer. Then the server that finally decided to deliver our check brought it to us with tears in her eyes as she was crying which we guess is from being overwhelmed.

{"text":"We have eaten here 4 times.  First time was terrible.  2nd time was very good, 3rd time very good.  Last time was horrible.  We ordered Italian sandwiches and they were mostly bread.  When I complained to the waiter, he said \"that is why we are famous for our pizza\"  That is the last time we will waste our money eating there.  I am surprised it is still open.  Chef Eddie Matney was working there for a short time and that is when the food was very good.  It did not last.  I miss Hazelwoods, which was the restaurant before this one in same location for many years."}
{"text":"First I have to say ..I love Chicago style deep dish pizza.  This service was friendly though when it is slow they do check on you often.   We loved the mozzarella sticks.  Highly recommend them.  We ordered 2 types of pizza and \"jumbo\" wings  Regular Chicago style- very yummy.  I recommend getting this style.   Deep dish- the sauce was good.  More seasoning would have made it great. I really did not like the crust.  It was corn meal style I think.  Very dry and lacked flavor.  Plus they thinkened the crust quite a bit on the edges so less toppings. I dont remember pizza at Gino's in Chicago tasting like this. This pizza could be your preference.   The jumbo wings- there was nothing jumbo about them where I am from NY.  They are the way wings should be made... meaty, spicy and yummy."}
{"text":"I had out of town visitors, and the restaurant that I was going to take them too had lost our reservation. We ended up in Gino's only because they were close, it was getting late, and we were all starving. What a surprise!!! These people have great food, the restaurant is nice and clean, and the service was excellent. I would definitely recommend to everyone, but go hungry, they have huge portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo AZ I finally got to Try Gino's East Pizza and for me it was just ok. I liked it ,but prefer brick oven thin crust . This pizza was definitely better tasting than \"Giordano's Pizza.\" and the service was really great . Attire is casual and prices reasonable . You will want to arrive no later than 5:30 , be prepared to valet park, don't be in a hurry because each deep dish takes about 45 minutes to an hour . As always if you go let me know and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday at around 6pm and the wait was not as long as I expected, only about half an hour.  However, about 20 min later and the wait was over an hour.   Pizza was good (had the spicy pepperoni). I especially liked the crust because it was not dry or crunchy, it was soft and chewy.  Overall, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out. Valet parking seems to be more prevalent in Arcadia so no surprise to see it here. My boyfriend can't have gluten and when looking at the menu online I was happy to see that they had gf options. I ordered my small deep dish right a way knowing it would take at least 45 min. We asked the waitress about the gf pizza and she mentioned that the pepperoni and sausage were options. When the bf tried to place his order our waitress went back into the kitchen to make an inquiry with the cooks. She came back to tell us that they didn't have any gf crust. Well that sucks. He ordered the deep dish nachos that were pretty disappointing. My deep dish came out and it was just meh. The sausage was good but the sauce was nothing special and the pizza was luke warm. I think I'll stick with Lou Malanati's"}
{"text":"I'm a Chicagoan & know my pizza joints. This isn't the same as the original one. Large pizza is more like a medium one & is over priced. Lou Malnatti's is better if you want Chgo style pizza."}
{"text":"We are from the suburbs of Chicago and were excited when GE came to the valley.  We have had GE many times before but were very disappointed with our trip to this location. This will be our first and last trip here.  We will drive a little farther down the road to Lou Malnatis."}
{"text":"I took the better half here this weekend.  She is from the windy city also and was finally excited to get here to eat.  I know about the deep dish pizza and it takes time to make.  The server did a fantastic job of explaining that too.  I do not think it is fair that people say the pizzas take to long. I think the instant gratification is taking its toll on the world now.   Back to the dinner.  We ordered a motz appetizer while we waited.  The server did tell us that it would be a few minutes for it.  (They are still working on streamlining the service she mentioned).  We ordered a deep dish with patty sausage and pepperoni.  The pizza was good too.  I thought the sauce was a bit salty, but it was still good.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"After almost an hour wait for the pizza, one it came out wrong.  The crust was burnt and the pizza was mediocre warm for all three.  The cheese had already hardened.  The second piece was so cooled off by then I couldn't even eat it.  The wings are good but the sauce makes it messy ( just s preference thing).  I do want to say that they did take reservations, so that was great.  The service was good and they had some very friendly people who worked there.  Drinks were also good but they don't have a drink menu  but have a full bar.   Since the pizza is what you go for I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"What a terrible place! Rudest service I have EVER experienced. You need to fire your staff and start over."}
{"text":"Dear Ginos East owner:  I am writing this review from one business owner to another.  First I want to say this.  I get it.  Someone talked you into a location around 36th Street and Indian School - just down the road from \"Arcadia\", near the \"Camelback corridor\", not \"far\" from downtown, etc, etc, etc.  How could this go wrong, right?  And now...you're sitting here a year or so from opening and you've got (as of this writing) 233 reviews with a 3.5 star rating, and (my pure guess...) your sales are not \"quite what you were hoping\".  And you're thinking...how do we make this thing work for us?  And...like all good profit-minded business owners you conclude...let's cut expenses so we can try to salvage some reasonable bottom line.  Which takes us to tonight...  My son and I dropped in for a \"quick\" bite at 6:15 tonight.  Almost nobody was there.  As my 12-year old son astutely noted when we left \"imagine how long it would have taken if they were busy\".  Exactly.  We left at almost 7:30.  Why did it take so long (over an hour) to get one small pizza?  Because you have almost no staff working tonight.  Why?  Because you are trying to save money to salvage something not working.  My advice to you - one business owner to another?  Spend the money (even on \"off\" Monday nights) to staff this place properly, or...give it up.  If you don't spend money, this building will be another \"mid-block\" restaurant/bar on Indian School Road (in a year or two) whatever you do.    As I said, I get it.  It's up to you."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! It has great service, good vibes, and all the best drinks on tap! I got wings, hummus, and of course deep dish pizza and all of it was wonderful! Sat at the bar and watched some baseball. 5/5 yelp review. Love the servers and hostesses too!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. Wrote review on Facebook and they told me to email corporate. Completely underwhelming and overpriced, such a let down. I was so excited for this new place that's in our neighborhood. My boyfriend from Chicago says their pizza is the worst pizza he's had. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This place has been so hyped up for what it actually is. Mozzarella sticks were awesome, pizza was good too. Service on the other hand was TERRIBLE. We saw our waitress like twice she was pretty bad. I get it deep dish pizza takes a while but people all around us got theirs before us and we had two kids with us- like hello trying to get them fed to leave. Will not be returning. By the way the restaurant wasn't busy when we got there either. We won't be returning and my husband is a Chicago native."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have a Gino's opening near our house and were so disappointed when we tried the Deep Dish Sausage Pizza yesterday.  First the crust is not what we consider deep dish.  The only thick part is the rolled edge.  The rest is the same or slightly thicker than any other pizza.   It couldn't even hold up the cheese and sauce.  The deep dish we always got at places in Chicago had crust that was at least an inch thick and really good bread type texture and flavor.  The crust doesn't have the flavor or texture of pizza dough.  It looks and tastes like corn meal.  Secondly there is way too much sauce and it tastes like there is sugar in it which I hate.  Third the sausage was scarce and didn't have that good sausage flavor.  It was blah.  I don't like doing food reviews because everybody has their own preferences but this is how my taste buds feel.  Another negative is that a MEDIUM Sausage pizza is $19 for the pizza and another $2.50 for the sausage for a total of $21.50 plus tax. That's too expensive for what you're getting. Sorry Gino's I really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"First off, not like Chicago location in quality of food, atmosphere or efficiency.  Wait times for tables were given up front (30 minutes - sat at bar). At table, first words out of server were 60-90 minutes for deep dish.  Almost felt like a game as server updated us on how long we had already waited.  Waited almost full 90 minutes.  I understand location is new, and they have some work to do before I would consider coming back"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and love Gino's but have always gotten their deep dish. Just had a thin crust pepperoni with half mushroom. OMG  Best pizza in years! Crispy. Tangy full flavor sauce. Awesome flavor. Wait staff friendly. Veteran discount. The best. And the cubs were on tv opening day 8-4 in ninth!!"}
{"text":"My wife had a deep dish pizza craving. We saw on the local news stations that a new Chicago style pizza place had opened in the valley called Gino's East so we had to try it out. We got out on a late start so we didn't get there until 7:00pm. Not too many places to self park so we did valet parking. Went inside and waited about 20 minutes for a table (pretty average). We ordered drinks and and appetizer fried calamari. We also placed our pizza order as we were told that a deep dish would take about 45 minutes to cook. The fried calamari was tasty but a little chewie, a little over done. The drinks were great and the beer was cold. Our pizza came out in the time like the waitress had told us. We were served our slices but the guy who brought it out. The pizza was good. The sauce was yasty but a little on the salty side. The crust was thick and held the pizza well. We decided to finnish off our dinner with desert so we had the beignets. They were a little doughy and bland. All and all we enjoyed our dinner and liked the friendly staff. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good. Been to the one on Michigan ave in Chicago several times. The pizza here is very similar. Thick and delicious. Wings were good as well. Service could be better but they just opened so I'll cut em some slack. Looking forward to going back. Would recommend they change the presentation of the wings--wadded up paper is not attractive"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout yesterday for the first time. The service was excellent, what little bit of the restaurant I saw when I went in to pick up was very nice, all employees greeted me with a smile and the pizza was very delicious. It was a great treat.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. $30 for a medium pizza, no other sides, drinks, etc., is a bit much for my wallet. Probably won't do it again anytime soon, except for maybe a special occasion, but this one time was worth it."}
{"text":"A million years ago, Gino's East was a special date-night location, which required a 28 mile drive into the city from Highland Park. What good luck that they have opened this place on Indian School. I did par-baked take out for a party for my daughter while she was home from med school in DC. Good, but not like being there. You know how it's just better straight out of the pizza oven. So, the next time the daughter was in town, we hosted a big enough party to order 10 pizzas, a big selection and salads. Heavenly. Not nearly enough left over because everyone kept trying to pack just a little more in. New Yorkers with your thin pizza, you can get that here too. But the cornmeal crust here is not like what others call deep dish. It's not bready at all. Crusty, deeply flavored. Wish I could eat here more often, but my jeans wouldn't fit then. They also have pasta, which I will never get to try because I have to have the pizza."}
{"text":"This was a great experience and a perfect reminder of how Chicago deep dish is done! We started out with the pub chips which came out fast and we could tell they were made to order. While we waited for our deep dish meaty legend we got stuck watching their chive TV that the manager Ryan said was just installed and wet love it. Before we knew it Skylar was back with our pizza and it was everything we had hoped for, a big meaty cheesy slice of heaven. Can't wait to go back again and suit on the patio for live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"So Gino's East of Chicago gets all 5 stars! Service was impeccable! Margherita pizza was phenomenal with all fresh ingredients. Caprese Crostini with Balsamic (heavenly) drizzle was just the right start to this meal. My friends had a (real) deep dish pizza smothered with meats, cheese and a sauce that is amazing. Rick and Olivia, the owners, made us feel very welcome, as though we were their personal guests. I am looking very forward to checking out the live patio bands on Friday AND Saturday nights now that our beautiful patio weather is here again. Misting system present and working though for those warmer days and nights. Sunday Happy Hour pricing was a great surprise even though regular prices are quite reasonable. The Bathrooms at Gino's East are modern and very clean. I am an honest Yelper and have only great things to say about Gino's East of Chicago. One last thing, we were given Sharpies to sign the wall! Fun! *****"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Didn't want to wait for a deep dish so we regretfully ordered a XL thin crust. This supposedly feeds 4-5 people. There was three of us normal size people there and it barley fed all of us. Anyways the pizza came out and we had to ask if it was an XL as it didnt fill out the pan and looked like a large at best. We were told it was an XL.  Now onto the pizza. Do not order THIN from here ever. Not sure if this was over cooked on accident or intentional, but it was hard. Could not eat the burnt rock solid crust. The only decent thing was the sauce. The toppings did not appear to have many cook marks.  The taste was not good at all. I'm from Chicago and am having a hard time writing this, but its true. Pizza with toppings was around $30. Total let down. Its sad to say. Service was good, I will go back to try the deep dish, but never thin ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"Overcooked pizza crust, terrible drinks and so so chicken wings. Sauce and meat were pretty good but disappointed overall. The inside decor was very nice especially the bar area. Too bad drinks weren't up to par. Liked the other Chicago brand a lot more."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as the original. Real deep dish, Chicago style.  Spicy sauce and fresh mozzarella, sausage and spicy pepperoni to die for.  Wash it down with some ice cold Old Style."}
{"text":"First, I am from Chicago and visited the Superior St. location many times.  I lived just up the road a piece from a Gino's in Rolling Meadows.  I moved to Phoenix in 2002 and have become pretty good at making my own deep dish pizza since my fave Gino's wasn't around.  Not to mention the location back home took a sharp downturn in quality, so we stopped going when visiting the family and that location eventually shut down. Competing with nostalgia is almost impossible, and I feared that when Gino's came to Phoenix that would be it's fate. So, we went with some friends this past weekend and I was certainly hopeful.  Our server was Taylor and she was very attentive during the long wait.  Finally, the pies arrived.  And...they were good!  Is it the same that I remember from 20 years ago?  No, but this isn't 20 years ago. I'd go back to Gino's and if you go, just be sure to order the sausage puck!!  :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the bar.  We ordered humus as an appetizer and a medium sized meaty legend authentic Chicago style deep-dish pizza for dinner.  It did not disappoint.  We loved it! The bartenders were great as well."}
{"text":"Walk into a large and aesthetically impressive bar but most take tables or booths for a full meal experience. The pizzas are super crispy, served in a metal dish full of wholes to avoid even the remote possibility of a soggy pizza. The caesar salad was okay, and you can order half-in-half for pizza toppings."}
{"text":"We have nothing bad to say about this marvelous restaurant. The service is incredible good our waiter was awesome and went the extra mile for us!!!! We love their wings and the deep dish pizza it's great   We often travel to Chicago and we always enjoy their food there, but now that we have Gino's here in Arizona and so close to us it's just great. Thank you for your great service."}
{"text":"I am a native Arizonian, love this pizza! The deep dish, don't even get me started - WOW says it all for me. I have never been to the original Gino's in Chicago but I am seriously going to make a trip just for that pizza to compare. 2 of my closest friends are from there and said it is awesome, so thanks Gino's for bringing a great deep dish to AZ for us AZ'onians to enjoy! Oh yes the Wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Food was about the same as what I've had many times over the years from Chi, but the service was the worst I've experienced at Gino's ever. We gave up after waiting for our pizza for an hour and a half and had them box it. A different server than ours tried to make excuses about how slow it was while several parties around us were seated and got food and their checks (this is not my first time at Gino's.) Ordered drinks as we sat which I'm sure the server forgot as it usually doesn't take a half hour to get 2 beers, for context a table was sat next to us after we had ordered drinks and appetizers, and they got both their drinks and appetizers about 15 minutes before we eventually got our drinks. 2 stars only because the food was good. I will probably try here again as this is my favorite deep dish pie in the world, but it'll be a while."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner with friends. Incredible food and tasted almost identical to the original Chicago location! WOW. Crystal and Jamie were incredible at the bar.  I'm so glad we choose the bar over sitting at a table or we may not have had this great of an experience. I'll be back often! They really make you feel welcome and they're excited to have you there"}
{"text":"I am surprised by how many people are bashing this place. The food is AMAZING! The staff was Super friendly and attentive. The drinks were well crafted. The live jazz was a beautiful touch. I am not sure what more anyone could want and I have nothing bad to say about.  I am not usually a deep dish fan, but I would go here in a heartbeat for their deep dish.  Be aware, the pizzas are made fresh so they take about 45 minutes. But the wait is 100%. We live busy crazy lives, so taking a little extra time to relax and enjoy the evening is good. So go! Go and enjoy Gino's!!!!! It is by far one of the best places to come to the Valley!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, that's a good Chicago pizza.  I had the Gino's special with sausage and a Field Greens salad. Serive was great, food was great - deep dish takes a while to cook - that's the way it is.  If you want it fast order ahead.  I ordered 45 min ahead, perfect timing."}
{"text":"Good food. Bartender had to many tables. They need to get better organization and service. Overall average."}
{"text":"Maybe it's an off night, but we ordered a Gino's Pizza to be delivered.  WE were given a time of about 60-70 minutes.  At 75 minutes, got an email that it would be another hour. while I was on the phone trying to figure out what the problem was, our pizza was delivered.   Immediately, I smelled that strong onion smell from dried or previously cut onions.  Freshly cut onions don't reek like that.  Not do they have the same taste.   One piece of our 4 piece pizza was eaten. Not pleasant, and a waste of $20.   Gino's, please use fresh onions and chop them as you're using them, not 3 days before."}
{"text":"Coming at lunchtime was a good idea - parking was no problem and I had no problems being seated immediately. I had the personal deep dish with a brewski to wash it down. The sauce was good and the cornmeal crust was what made me a fan - I just love the taste and texture of it. Service was very friendly, the atmosphere was typical of a big semi-upscale pizza joint: lots of seating, big screens for sports, and moderate noise level. Deep dish takes a while to cook - about 45 minutes, so enjoy exchanging pleasantries with your friends or watching the game on the screens during the wait for the pies to be done."}
{"text":"Gino's is up there in the top 5 best pizza restaurants in the valley. The others being- Lou malnaties, Bianco, parlor, and federal pizza (in no specific order). I ordered a large sausage pizza. Two slices and you're feeling nice. Three slices and your either napping or on the pot. Cool atmosphere on a Sunday. I'll be back for another 3 slices soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Slow service. It took an hour for the pizza to be brought out.   Just ok food. Disappointed with the Gino East experience"}
{"text":"In 1977 a 7 year old boy was introduced to a Downtown Chicago Pizza Co. that would forever change the way he would judge what was and what was NOT good pizza. That little boy... Was me. Lol Now living in Arizona I'm so happy that Gino's East is here for me to enjoy once again without having to fly home to do so. I look forward to going back and ordering the other deep dish pizza on the menu with friends who have yet to experience the miracle that is Gino's Pizza! Thanks Justin for all your help and we'll be back to see you in the future! Now excuse me while I slip into this well deserved food coma.  PS don't tell people it's gonna be 35 minutes to sit down when you clearly have 10 open tables. The 4 stars were given on the pizza and Justin's service alone! Luckily someone got up from the bar cause I could have just as easily been satisfied with wings from Zipps across the street. Lol I have a back story for that place too.  BobbyO312"}
{"text":"Disappointing. After a 45 minute wait, I tried their pizza, mac and cheese and an appetizer. The pizza crust was crumbly and flavorless, the appetizer tasted like fast food and the mac and cheese was horrible. I had such high hopes--especially after the wait. One and done."}
{"text":"Arizona has really become a hot bed to some of the best restaurants Chicago has to offer recently. Now we have some of their iconic thick crust pizza joints popping up all over the Valley. When I visited Chicago for the first time, Gino's was my favorite. But it's hard to really tell who makes the best pizza because they are all so good. Gino's East opened in the mid-60's and has restaurants all over Chicago. They just recently expanded outside Chi-town toward the West. Lou Malnati's has proven thick crust pizza can be successful in AZ and Giordano's has just recently opened. This is Gino's first location and they picked the foodie booming area of Arcadia to start their business. They have continued their tradition of allowing patrons to sign and graffiti the interior walls and tables. The look of the restaurant itself has an industrial feel to it. The service was friendly and they did a great job of explaining how long it takes and the process of making their pizza. Gino's uses a cornbread crust and they layer their pizza with cheese on the bottom followed by the toppings and the sauce. The homemade mozzarella sticks were nice and stringy. We got the meaty legend pizza and the sauce was nice and chunky and the crust was firm yet not too crumbly. We came on a quiet afternoon for my bday and enjoyed our visit here. I'm excited for the future of the AZ food scene and feel fortunate to have some of the best eats of Chicago opening up here."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied. Absolutely not Gino's East. Pizza lacked flavor, cheese is below average. This brand has definite problems. How can name be used without exact recipes?? Server was great. Won't be back... wow , what a thud!"}
{"text":"We came in on Manic Monday for their wing special and to have a beer. There were tons of open tables both inside and on the patio when we were told \"it will be a 30-35 min wait.\" I said \" but there are lots of open tables on the patio\". We were then told that they were lacking wait staff (thus the wait time). We found a couple seats at the bar, so decided to sit there rather than wait 30 min. The bartender (nice bald dude), did an excellent job, despite the fact that he had no help at all. Had the wings (half price on Monday's), which were very meaty,crispy and tasty (although a couple more sauce offerings would be nice).  The bottom line is \"Gino's, get moving and hire the people you need and get them trained and working!\" It's ridiculous to have that kind of wait with tons of open tables because you don't have the wait staff. Also, why not have some kind of happy hour? $1 off a beer is not asking too much. $3 off domestic drafts (on Mondays)..Hello? Craft beers are domestic beers! The Bud light/Miller/ Corona beers should be called \"neighbor beers\".."}
{"text":"It's such a great building.  I wish the food and service were better.  I wouldn't recommend eating here for lunch.    First off the parking is valet only.  The valet is free, but it's still valet.  When I got at Gino's East the parking lot was mostly empty, but I wasn't allowed to park my own car.  I have a large vehicle that has a tricky stick shift, so I don't get it valeted.  There is no option to park your own car at Gino's.  I parked across the street, then dodged traffic.  I sat at the bar because I was by myself.  I ordered an iced tea.  The bartender wasn't very friendly.  I overheard him complaining about other customers.  Phoenix has very high standards for iced tea.  Gino's doesn't meet them.  They find out what restaurants with good iced tea are doing differently.  I ordered the lunch special.  It comes with a side and a entree.  I got a side salad with the house dressing (creamy vinegerette) and a personal pepperoni deep dish pizza.  My salad was really good.  My pizza was very small.  It was good, but it was a very small portion.  The lunch special cost $8.  Overall, the food was good and the value was good, but the service and parking didn't make it worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere, clean, big TVs with sports set a relaxing atmosphere. The pizza is out of this world, I will be back for my next cheat meal for sure!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since they opened, but I stopped in a few times and the wait was ridiculous.  I have a 2-year-old who loves pizza!  So, I ordered delivery tonight.  I ordered the margarita thin crust pizza, field greens salad and eggplant burrata bowl.  Everything was mediocre.  I was really disappointed with the pizza crust.  It has no flavor, at all.  The salad was average and the appetizer was also, \"okay\".  For the price and hype, I was not impressed.  LGO pizza blows this away!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Save your money. Period. We ordered deep dish pizza that had globs of cheese under a watery tomato paste. None on top. Spinach cheese sticks. GROSS. No taste. We had to put salt..still gross. Everything on the table..still gross. Nice waiters though."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time trying to come here. This time I just wanted to order a pizza to go and enjoy it at home for my Mother's Day guilty pleasure vs waiting an hour to be seated and another hour for my pizza to be made. Unfortunately, they said they are not doing to go orders until June 1. Called Lou Malnati's and they will have my pizza ready in 30 mins. It's further from my house but Gino's East is a nightmare. Maybe I'll try later this year once they have their stuff together. Seems like they opened prematurely or something! They need help."}
{"text":"It may not have totally lived up to, how I remember the original in Chicago,that I grew up with, but it was close enough for me.  I love lots of sauce and that buttery crust.   Service was great.  Aaron was our server.  My niece wanted a picture, since we don't get together as often as we like, and instead of doing a selfie we asked Aaron to do it.  They brought this huge frame to put around us.  Very fun. Deep dish is not an every day pizza.  It's for when you have a craving. Also had the spinach sticks...yum."}
{"text":"OK but bland pizza compared to original in Chicago.  Restaurants that do NOT accept reservations is a real pain."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I had Gino's pizza in Chicago and when I found out that they were opening one here, I couldn't believe it!!  Pizza is amazing and the crust is to die for!And the service was on point!  Keep in mind that since it just opened there will be a little of a wait time But it's Definitely worth the wait!!  You can also even write something on the wall! Just like the one in Chicago!"}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago, you have your allegiance to one of the several deep dish pizza restaurants. But since Gino's east is from Chicago we decided to put that aside and give it a try. Disappointed. The pizza is drowning in a sweet tomato sauce. We ordered a sausage and mushroom. We each ate 2 slices and counted a max of 4 sausage pieces in total. It was more like a cheese pizza with a little bit of toppings. The slices were not filling at all. We gave it a try but that will be the last time.   We will stick with our favorite, that luckily also opened a restaurant here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tie die pizza,  amazing.  And wings are to die for! I plan on returning again and again"}
{"text":"Legitimate deep dish Chicago-style pizza right here in the valley! Let's start with the mozzarella sticks - homemade, amazing flaky crust - delicious. We tried the half Meaty Legend half Jalepeno Blue - really great sauce, toppings and buttery crust! Check it out! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I thought the Pizza was OK .. the sauce was just falling off the pizza ,, not sure what to think about that.. But My problem was the Waiter... It looked like he had just climbed out of bed and his attitude was the same...he was working behind the bar and He really didn't seem like he wanted to be there at 2 in the afternoon . Not sure we are going back."}
{"text":"Tried Gino's East because we love Lou Malnati's and know there's a big rivalry. After getting the deep dish, I'm not sure how anyone could even compare the two. The deep dish and thin crust were hard as a rock. The rest was just mediocre. The dining area wasn't very large, and with the exception of one area, all the large booths only accommodate 6 people. Icing on the cake was when a food runner tried to place a hot pizza at the end of the table right in front of a 1 year old . The prices are certainly fair, but it's not worth the drive for my family. I'm disappointed this was a miss."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  Loved everything about it.  We were there for the VIP Night before it opened and were amazed.  Let me start by saying that I am NOT a pesto fan but was told to try the Zucchini Spiral Pasta as well as the Tie Dye Pizza.  Both have Pesto and both I loved!  Being from Illinois, I was super excited to get my hands of the famous DEEP DISH!  We went for the Meaty Legend. It did not disappoint.   We were taken care of by Jamie, Monica and Ryan.  A wonderful trio behind the bar that kept the drinks full and ice cold as well as serving up some sweet tastes of Chicago.  Coldest draft beer I have had in a while. Finally for dessert we ordered the Cinnamon Sugar Beignet Balls.  Totally delicious.  Word to the wise, they are HOT! Don't forget to leave your name on the wall before you leave.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Gino's. We love pizza but aren't big fans of deep dish but still wanted to give our new neighborhood pizza spot a try. We arrived to find no wait and a half full restaurant. We were quickly seated and were informed that the deep dish pizza takes 45 minutes but thin crust takes \"ONLY\" 30 ! We are not accustomed to this wait at our regular pizza spots (The Parlor, Cibo, Piazza Al Forno) , but this is in our hood and we wanted to give them a chance. We ordered our salad and pizza and drinks at the same time from the bartender. We noticed it did not appear that he had put the order in before bringing out our drinks so I mentioned to him that he should put the whole order in at once and not hold up the pizza order. He assured us he had already put the order in. 45 minutes later he came by to say it would be out soon. A few minutes later a woman came by to say it would be 4-5 minutes longer. Ten minutes later the pizza arrived. It looked great, but when we pulled out the first piece we saw raw dough. The bartender came back and we showed it to him and he wanted to take it back to the kitchen to cook more but by this time we had waited over an hour! I asked to see the manager and he came over and agreed it was undercooked. He said they would pick up our drinks and hoped we'd return to try the pizza again! I have worked in restaurants for years and I realize that we are human and we all make mistakes but damnit, have some integrity! It's how we handle those mistakes that makes us sink or swim. From the bartender/server who didn't own up to his mistake to the kitchen crew who sent out food they knew was rushed and undercooked, this place lacks integrity and trustworthiness which is why I will not be dining there again. With so many fantastic options in our neighborhood, I doubt many folks will try them more than once."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for lunch hoping it wouldn't be so busy.  We got right in and sat outside, it was a beautiful day!  We ordered drinks and a deep dish pizza.  It finally came, apparently the waitress said it would be 45 minutes until we get it, i didn't hear that part, but whatever. Our pizza finally came, someone else brought it out and served us each a piece, we were ready to dig in, then the waitress came up to \"cut\" the pieces left in the pan, sim-handled  the handle, it flew straight into the 4 pieces of pizza still in the pan.  She apologized and went on about her way, I had sauce on my shirt, there was sauce on the wall and in my water.  We both agreed that having a handle that has been in how many dirty hands and god knows where else, we didn't want the rest of that pizza.  The manager happened to come around and ask how everything was.  We proceeded to explain the situation that happened, she offered to give us half off the pizza that we had 2 slices out of....really??  we had 2 slices out of the 8 available....we said that wasn't good enough.  they finally agreed to take the pizza off and give a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit. The pizza, I can say I've had better. to much sauce, not enough cheese and not enough meat, considering that it was the meat pizza!!   I may try the thin crust next time with our free app, but if it sucks too, sorry but we wont be back.  Which is really sad because there are not really any good pizza joints in the \"hood\"!"}
{"text":"We were not impressed! The longgggg wait (90 minutes for a table at 5pm on a Sunday) and somewhat disorganized staff were to be expected for just opening. The wings were good, however we hated the pizza. All 8 of us are from Chicago and love deep dish and this was honestly awful. There wasn't enough crust, it was soggy, and the sauce was sweet. We will definitely stick to Lou's."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner the second night they were open.  Anytime we go to a restaurant right after they open we expect there to be a few issues, but our experience was great!  When we got there, it only took about 15 min to be seated (I expected over an hour wait).  Our server was extremely helpful and suggested we order our drinks and pizza first due to the 45 min cook time.  We ordered the spicy kale Caesar as a starter at his recommendation and it was fantastic - My husband doesn't even eat kale and he was fighting me for the last bite! Our pizza arrived and I must say, this is my new favorite deep dish. The sauce is sweet,  the crust has this amazing cornbread flavor and it isn't as dry as some others I've tried at other restaurants.  Overall a great experience- will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, manager is the rudist peson i've ever meet talked to them bout the service told me doesnt care go somewhere else if you dont like it, will definitely not be going back or recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Had pizza both deep dish and extra large thin today and it was outstanding, enjoy eating there every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Disappointed  with Gino's East deep dish pizza!  We order 2 pizzas (1 large sausage, mushroom and onion and 1 medium Pepperoni ). I was wondering why the restaurant was half empty on Wednesday at about 7:30 PM!  Now I know why, expensive very below average pizza!  6 of us were eating and we all rated it a 2 out of 5 and 1 rated it a 3 out of 5. With the long list of great/good pizza restaurants in the valley I don't see this making it!  Bring back Hazelwood!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay - service was horrific.  Italian beef sandwich with peppers, thin crust pizza, pasta alfredo, kale salad and drinks all around. Our group came here Friday night. No wait for a table but expect to REALLY wait for your food - especially if the waiter forgets to turn it into the kitchen. The pizza came first, despite our pre-seating warnings about the length of time to prepare pizza. Even after our food did arrive (because delivery of the pizza apparently reminded the waiter that we had other food ordered), we were still missing our salads. The waiter \"forgot.\" He didn't offer to do anything to fix his problem, he just sent the manager over to offer us dessert - which we didn't want. We had been there an hour and just wanted to eat and leave. The waiter did tell us he takes this sort of thing personally - (who cares about how we, the guests take it?) - yet he babbled with a group at another table for a good 10 to 12 minutes after that when he promised to get our check \"right away.\" The food is not worth the tortuous service. All that and they didn't even take one entre off the tab - pathetic."}
{"text":"Wow what a Great place!! We went and I have now become a deep dish Chicago pizza Lover!! We had the meat deep dish and it was delicious!! My husband is a wing man and he loved the jumbo wings! We sat at the bar and we met Gabe (whom I now will call a friend) :) he was friendly and very attentive to our needs. The restaurant is beautiful and decorated with many fabulous pictures of Chicago. Any person from Chicago will feel at home seeing them I'm sure. We will definitely be going back soon. Thank You Ginos for bringing Chicago Pizza to Arizona!!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this Gino's East!  I've eaten at Gino's in Chicago for many years and this pizza tasted nothing like it!  First of all, (there were 10 of us) the kids meals and adult sandwich came out way before our pizzas so we ate separately. Then our deep dish pizzas were just luke warm.  The kids thin crust was very hot (as should be but over cooked so it was very dark on the bottom). Our half cheese half sausage had so much sauce on it that you could hardly taste anything else. The cheese pizza was the only one that resembled the original Gino's East at all.  The ambiance was mediocre and the valet only a pain.  Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"It's the grand opening, so we waited in line. 2 hours, but our choice. When we did get in, numerous open tables! I am sure kitchen was behind, but let us in to at least get out of the heat and drink a beer. It  was hot. First impressions are of a nice new space with quite a bit of seating and a small patio. A few tv's and a bar area. Prices are a bit high. Maybe fine for Chicago, but this is Phoenix. No happy hour, but some daily specials, but not today apparently, even though it is Monday. Manic Monday according to the menu. Good selection of local craft brews. Least expensive glass of wine is $9. Finally our pizza arrives! They are very up front that the deep dish will take 45 minutes. It is good. Just not sure if that's my style. The crust is delicious but filling. Tasty sauce and ample cheese.  This place is fine, just not sure the prices are justified. Willing to come back however and try some different options on the menu. The wait sucked, but servce overall was good and the staff friendly, once we got in."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved Gino's East in Phoenix. Delicious Pizza, fresh crisp salad and tasty wings. The staff was so friendly and made us feel so welcome. The decor is welcoming and warm. We will be back Mark and Monica Miller"}
{"text":"I like Gino's deep dish a lot. It is really delicious and I enjoy it a lot. I think they could be a little better with the toppings though. I got mushroom takeout recently and the mushrooms were pretty sparse. My wife and I got sausage pizza once and I don't remember the sausage being sparse. The game was pretty loud when we ate in the restaurant. That's all fine and good, if you want to watch the game. Maybe we picked a bad night, it would have just been nice to know that going in. But now you, the reader, know that. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious and the service was even better! Very fun atmosphere. Great place to have some pizza and beer and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Finally a deep dish in Phoenix with a delicious buttery crust. I live on the other side of town, I have a Giordanos 2 miles away but I will be making that trip to Gino's. The people there were amazing too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and have been dying for this Gino's to open up. I didn't want to go right when they opened as I knew they needed some time to get it together. Anyways, I ordered take out the other day and my whole experience was great. The lady on the phone was super nice, greeted me with an upbeat tone, verified my order and was just pleasant to talk to.   Parking was simple upon arrival as they have designated take out spots right in front. The host (probably the same girl) was very bubbly, told me I had about 10 min left on my order, offered me water and showed me where to sit. They had live music playing and he was pretty decent to listen to. The games were on and they were pretty busy this particular evening.   When my Pizza was done she brought it to me and thanked me for coming in. I'm all about excellent customer service.  I live about 15 min away but when I got home my pizza was still hot and it was so delicious. Just like the Gino's back home! I'm so excited I had a good experience and will return soon."}
{"text":"If seriously couldn't get worse.  Service was horrific, but the food was just nasty!  Calamari was tough, pizza was cold, everything greasy and definitely not worth a 45 minute wait.  We didn't order deep dish either!  I'll tell you how bad it was, the manager apologized, gave us a gift card and when we went across the street to The Nook to finally  eat a real meal, I gave it to the manager there because we will NEVER EVER go back.  Experience with staff, wait, and food was less than one star.  Don't waste your time -"}
{"text":"One year ago, I was checking out a few local establishments (bars & breweries) with Windy City ties, while watching my beloved Cubs win a World Series title. Flash forward 364 days and I'm hanging out in another Chi-Town favorite, Gino's East, to celebrate the end of a great year. And the co-worker who celebrated the victory at The Duce with me last year, was along for this visit too.  Peter, in fact, is the one who recommended we visit Gino's East. I was excited for this opportunity because I've heard a lot of buzz about the authenticity of this and that. Plus there is the natural comparison with Lou Malnati's. And now I've tried both. And in my opinion, there was a clear winner.  In case you missed my review of the other deep dish experts, let's save that for the end. Call me weird, but I tried to order something very similar, in order to compare and contrast.  For starters, the Fried Calamari at Gino's is excellent! I love Calamari, but this was the best I've tried! It was lightly breaded, very tender and extremely generous! It was a great start to the meal! Sorry Lou!  The service was also impressive. Skylar greeted us in the bar area and was very kind, helpful and even asked if it was our first visit. She did an amazing job from beginning to end and happily boxed up the leftovers. This was a draw, because the service at Lou's was also impressive. Both Lou's and Gino's take pride in serving those first and second slices for their guests. No complaints from me!  Finally, the pizza itself. Gino's is an excellent deep dish. It's got lots of toppings and a deliciously sweet tomato sauce. And the crust is one of the best crusts you can find anywhere. I've tried deep dish at other competitors places and typically, I'm done after one slice. The pizza is made so well at Gino's that a second slice is an inevitability.  The bottom line is, I have to give the edge to Lou's. The pizza is less heavy on the sauce so it holds up well if you want to pick it up. And while I like Gino's crust, I prefer the buttery flavor of Lou's. Also, I love the chunky tomato sauce at Lou's. But this doesn't mean I won't be back to Gino's. They have a bigger variety of combinations on the menu and I'm dying to try them.  Gino's may be my second favorite place for deep dish, but it's a very close second. Holy Cow, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed!  Very much was looking forward to experiencing some good Chicago deep dish pizza.  Sadly, we experienced a very confused, poorly managed and terrible service. Our waitress had little of no care that out wait for our pizza was 1 hour 45 mins.  She simply said, \"oh well, the wait is worth it!\"  Well, my table and the few tables around me complained.  One table was provided free dinner since the food they ordered never arrived.  Once our pizza came out, it was NOT a real deep dish, but thicker than most NY style pizzas.  To boot, table was messy/dirty when seated.  Sorry, but would think twice before you waste 3 hours to get a meal with zero service."}
{"text":"Poor location- valet parking only, our waitress was extremely rude.  Pizza was very good but not sure if will return because the wait staff was so incredibly rude and provided such poor service.  Pizza was tasty but not enough to bring me back"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Chicago-style pizza, so I ordered mac and cheese with buffalo chicken. I really wasn't impressed with it. The portion was huge but lacked flavor. I tried some of my boyfriend's pizza which wasn't that great either. He ordered a meat-lover type of pizza that was recommended by our server. He is a pizza fanatic and wasn't too crazy about it. The only thing I was impressed with was the service. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. She was finishing her shift, so we paid her before we got our food. They had another server take over, but she kept checking in on us which I thought said a lot about the business's character. The service was wonderful, but the food wasn't. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what the hate is for people.  Pizza is fantastic. Spinach mozzarella sticks are as well.  Yes its expensive, yes it takes a long time to cook the pizza.   I hear the hut is pretty fast with competitive prices if thats what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Went to Genos East to eat and watch the Mayweather fight. Arrived early but already crowded. Fight being shown in the bar area only. Talked with Mgr Rick Nunley who clearly believes in customer service. He decided to show it in the restaurant area also so all could see. The prelims and fight took about 3 hours and Rick and the great staff were all fine with letting everyone stay to watch the entire time. Very impressed! Food was great! The best part, LOL, was that Genos was probably the only place in town that didn't charge a cover! Will be back and spread the word!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Gino's East on our quest to try the Trifecta of Chicago-style pizza to hit the desert!  We went on a weeknight so wouldn't have to wait in the long lines noted in many previous reviews.  Walked right in and were seated at a table near the bar so we could watch the baseball playoffs.  Groaned when the TV changed to Thursday night football but the bartender immediately checked that nobody at the bar was watching and switched it back.  We were thrilled to find out that our server was Regina - she who is mentioned in so many reviews!  Our service was as good as advertised - Regina even helped us prank the friend dining with us!  She did get a kick out of us calling her the \"famous Regina from yelp!\"  But about the food - we tried the spinach sticks.  My husband does not like spinach but tried to eat more than his share of the appetizer!  They were great with just the right amount of spinach to cheese.  We had the Field Salad with the house dressing - the entrée salad was more than enough for three of us to share!  And the pizza - we ordered the Meaty Legend but of course had to customize it.  Pizza came out exactly as ordered in all of its cheesy tomato deliciousness.  The crust is a little mealier than other deep dish pizza places (heard that they add corn meal) but complimented the sauce.  I noticed that we all ate the crust and didn't leave it as we have at other places.  The tiramisu and apple crumble were both good and more than enough for the table to share.    We will definitely be back - both for the food and the service!"}
{"text":"As a Chicago pizza lover, I was thrilled to find a pizza shop in Phoenix that could do it right! If you find yourself in the area or simply looking for that authentic Deep Dish bite, check out the Chi-Talian Stallion!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great service and the pizza taste just like from Chicago. The restaurant is looks great and is comfortable.   Ohhh I am full"}
{"text":"We had a six hour layover in Phoenix, so we decided to leave the airport and head to Gino's for food and drinks. So glad we did, because the food was great, and the bartender, Justin, was awesome! He took great care of us. Service was outstanding, and now we have enough beer and food in us to help us survive our flight."}
{"text":"So I guess this place will not be accepting phone orders until June 1st, over a month from now!!! That's what a lady over the phone is saying. No explination as to why. At least the other guys have a take out refer with take & bake pizzas. Maybe that's a red flag as to why the others have such a long wait. But for now I won't know the difference...unless I wait for 2 hours.  Will change my review if I ever actually get to try it. I'm not yet convinced that they care about their customers."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Phoenix location, and it was amazing. We called in our pizza order while we were driving, so the pizza was ready shortly after we were seated. Our server was so friendly and helpful (the whole staff was friendly)! He overheard my husband say that it was my birthday, and he brought me a free apple crisp. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Gino's for the first time, and this might have been the best pizza I've ever had! Fantastic food and great service. Will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is a far cry from the Geno's East in Chicago.  This Geno's east is the same company from Chicago but the food and the experience is definitely not the same.  I was very disappointed but i guess when you compare it to the original in Chicago it has big shoes to fill.  The staff was friendly so no problems there, but the food was horrible.  First the buffalo mac n cheese was pretty much Kraft mac n cheese out of a box with frozen buffalo chicken fingers laying on top of the mac n cheese on a plate.  I took two bites and couldn't stomach it anymore, but i wasn't there for the mac n cheese i was there for the pizza!  I ordered DEEP DISH MEATY LEGEND PIZZA which is the same as the one i ordered in Chicago.   The pizza is made of Pepperoni, Italian sausage, Canadian bacon, bacon.  After a very long wait for the pizza which was about an hour which i get because it takes time to cook a deep dish the pizza came out and it was runny.  The crust wasn't good and falling apart and the ingredients were runny almost watery falling off the slice as i picked it up.  There was a puddle of fluid at the bottom of the pan.  Now, in Chicago i could pick up a slice and it all stayed together and the crust was flaky and held together.  The pizza was a major disappointment.  After I talked to the manager to give them my honest opinion and the manager said it is the pans.  The pans are so new that the more you cook with the pan the better the pizza will taste and hold together.  I asked him how long does that take until the pizza will be like Chicago and he said 6-9 months!!!!  So, basically what i got out of that is they are making crappy pizza for months and he told me to come back after that time to try it out.  Now i understand the whole pan making the pizza better, but that was just unacceptable.  I have not gone back since which is very disappointing to me since I love Geno's in Chicago.

{"text":"My favorite of all the deep dishes places in Chicago. Their crust is a cornmeal and really adds to flavor. Meats and cheeses we plentiful.  Atmosphere was nice and service and staff we good.  We tried all the popular deep dish places and this was our favorite."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and this is my all time favorite pizza..Unfortunately I will have to wait to get back to the city to enjoy it. Service was defintely horrible, We ordered a thin crust with xtra sauce and green pepper and onion. The peppers and onion were chopped up and just thrown on top..terrible!! It also looked and tasted frozen, but the deep dish was close, just no cigar. Bland tasteless crust and over seasoned sausage.The best part was the Buffalo chicken mac and cheese..Oh well..at least Lou Malnati's got it right, much better choice for Chicago pizza..I was so hoping this would be good..nope!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place is. The service is just okay and the food wasn't really all that good. For a pizza place you kind of expect the pizza here to be phenomenal and it just wasn't. I would definitely go somewhere else if you are looking for good pizza. With so much competition around town you think the food would be better here. I wouldn't recommend going here to eat."}
{"text":"The Famous Gino's East is a high standard of expectations when it comes to Chicago pizza. Unfortunately after trying the Deep Dish pie and Chicago thin crust I felt disappointed. This place is in a great location down the road from my house. Extremely nice staff and the owner who I met on my first visit was great! I will still come to Gino's East just not for their pizza. The chicken wings & Buffalo sauce are pretty good."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The sauce was amazing and the cheese was to die for but the crust was a mix between garlic bread and corn bread but it was overbuttered, crunchy, and hard.  It's the first week in phoenix so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.   I had the wings they were great and I love that they had large pitchers of beer. I did not like the padding of paper at the bottom of the wings and I mentioned it to the manager when she walked around and asked. She turned as away and inored my comment. Don't add fluff to your wings to make it look like you gave me a lot of wings. It was six not a dozen as the buket made it seem. I was disappointed in being fooled. I have no problem ordering a second bucket, had I known it was only 6 wings. (-/+)"}
{"text":"I am a huge pizza fan! I was excited to see Gino's East opening in the Phoenix area so I thought to give it a try.  A buddy and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. A nice slow time.  I explained that I have been a regular at another Chicago deep dish icon but that I was willing to give them a chance. I let my server know that I was well experienced in Chicagos finest, Lou Malnattis.   Our waitress understood as I explained that this was going to be a direct comparison and the winner would have my business.   Here is where it all started to crumble.   Our waitress was very heavy in pushing a salad or appetizer on us. \"It takes at least an hour to cook this pizza\" she warned. Really, most Chicago pizza is a 35 minute cook. Here they just hound you into adding appys. The cost of their pizzas are 25% higher than Lou Malnatti's. I see no reason to ever return.  The pizza came 1:05 later and it was no good. They apologized for the dough being bad. They left it with us while they cooked us a new one. It was terrible. The crust was like a brick! The new one came to the table in 18 minutes. What happened to the hour long bake? There have been many others who encountered this \"bad dough\" thing I recently learned.  The Gino's East may be gone before we know it. Good riddance. This was a bad experience from walking in the door. I will not be back.  Thank you Lou Malnatti's for your value and quality consistency."}
{"text":"Now that we have the 'big 3' famous Chicago pizza places here in Phoenix, I had to compare them. Parking at this location is quite difficult and I'm not aware of what you're supposed to do with your car if the entire lot is full. It's not like there is any place else near by to park. I eventually saw someone leaving, and got a spot.  The folks inside are all very friendly. There is writing on the walls, as they encourage customers to write on the walls, so you don't have to worry about getting dressed up to go here.  The pizzas take the standard 45 minutes to cook after being ordered, same as all Chicago deep dish restaurants.  We ordered a small deep dish pepperoni pizza and it arrived 45 minutes later, as planned.  I thought everything was good except the pizza sauce. It was just way, way too sweet for my taste. The edge crust is massive. It's very yeasty and dry, and when you get to that part of the pizza, the sauce balances it out. However, the sauce is just way too sweet until you get to that big hunk of bread at the edge.  The cheese is great and the crust is good. I also like that the bottom of the crust is fairly thin for a deep dish.  I have to say, all things considered, it's almost a tie with Malnati's except that I find Malnati's sauce perfect.  I'd have to rate them in this order:  4) Giordanos (worst of the bunch) 3) Buddyz 2) Gino's East 1) Malnati's  That said, my wife and her friends prefer Gino's East to Malnati's. Everyone's taste is different.  Service was excellent and cheerful. I will definitely eat here again and recommend it to others, but unfortunately, its not my favorite. I would be nice if they offered an alternate sauce - one less sweet. Then they could be number 1 in my book.  Prices were good and it's easy to find."}
{"text":"I was so excited and had high expectations for Gino's. A friend of mine from Chicago told me this was as good or if not better than Lou Malnatis.. I had the supreme thick crust pizza. The crust was good, sauce was okay. The mozzarella cheese sticks and wings were delicious. Overall I'd give it a 3.5. Still prefer Lou Malnatis"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have had since moving to Phoenix. Ordered thin crust - crust was not thin and was hard as a rock. Could not finish for fear of breaking a tooth. Service was just okay, nothing special and pretty slow. After finishing our first round of drinks sat for 10 minutes waiting to order another round. Restaurant was not that busy at the time. Went up to hostess stand to see about getting a second round and heard the manager berating a wait staff member - so unprofessional. This place is so not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. The food was ok. For the price and what Chi town food is... I would say this place is weak and corporate. The bartender told me the best thing is the thin crust pizza... wait I thought we were at a Chicago deep dish pizza joint? I got an Italian beef after hearing that and it was sub par at best."}
{"text":"We had a great waiter!  Everyone was super friendly!  I was there with my mom, we each ordered a small deep dish pizza.  Mine was cooked perfect.  My moms crust was fairly soggy in the middle.  When the manager asked how things were she told him and he made a few excuses and never really apologized or offered to do anything about it.  Kind of disappointed about that.  She brought it home and finished cooking it. The other thing I noticed from when I used to eat it in Chicago years ago is that the patty sausage doesn't go all the way to the edge of the crust like it used to.  It did taste great though!"}
{"text":"I have waited 21 years for this to open in Phoenix!!! It was just like Chicago. Amazing!!! Did not disappoint at all!!! The only difference was the temperature outside."}
{"text":"I lived around the corner from Ginos East in Chicago. I loved their pizza. I have not tried the Gino's in Phoenix until today. I decided to try their pizza to serve to friends who have eaten at Gino's in Chicago. Well our take out order was handled correctly even though they were slammed with Super Bowl Business. The Pizza was as it has been for years. I served it 2 hours after I picked it up and the directions to reheat were spot on. Thanks Gino's for keeping the perfection I remember years ago."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment :( Ordered a small deep dish pizza and got less than what I paid for. The crust is as hard as a rock (nearly chipped a tooth) they pile on a ton of mozzarella cheese to the point where it slides off the pie. I ordered anchovies and they slap on some anchovy paste and call it a day.. Wont be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Love the crust on this pizza.  One of my fav Chicago deep dish.  Granted I only order take out due to the 45 min cook time but it tastes great when I eat it in my kitchen."}
{"text":"So excited for this new opening in the neighborhood.  We snuck our kids out of school for a surprise lunch and thought it would be a perfect opportunity to enjoy pizza without the crowd.  The layout is good and staff seems nice upon first contact. We ordered a large deep dish pizza for the family and were told to expect 45min - 1hr for the pizza to cook.  That seems a bit extreme for lunch, but we had checked the kids out so let's commit.  We ordered some hummus and mozzarella sticks to hold the hungry kids over.  After about an hour patrons around us started to get pizzas so we knew we were close. At one moment we thought we were in business as a large pizza passed us and went to a two top next to us.  10 minutes later a second pizza, a small, arrived at the two top and at that moment the server realized the mistake.  My families pizza was delivered to the wrong table!  Now, this happens sometimes and I understand, especially in a new place.  We were informed that a new pizza could be ready for us in 30 minutes.  Obviously with starving children needing to get back to school this wasn't going to work so we asked to close out and we could grab a burger on the way back to school.  The manager came over to apologize and picked up our $11 in appetizers and thanked us for our time.....wha? No \"come back another time and grab a pizza on us, sorry for the inconvenience\"?  Free hummus for 1hr 30min of sitting in a half full restaurant only to watch our neighbors chow on our pizza?  I really don't seek free food and rarely complain, but I felt that an invite back to enjoy the only thing we came to the store for would have felt more in line with a customer experience I would expect.  We were polite to the manager and server as we understand mistakes happen, especially early on.  Apparently we needed to be nasty people as the manager had several gift cards cupped in her hand in case we threw a fit but decided she didn't need to use them since we were nice.    To add insult the couple next to us that ate 1/3 of our pizza informed us it was \"just ok\" as they were eating it.  Thanks for a poor customer experience.... so disappointed"}
{"text":"So happy they are finally back in the valley now live my hometown food. .. it would get 5 but just one issue... need a lot more cheese line Giordanos. .. of course I'll be back and I'm looking forward to trying other items on your menu such as the thin crust pizza and pasta"}
{"text":"Pizza good. Service not so good. Had to ask a server to wait on us....then she forgot about us. Checked on us after eating the pizza. Parking: about 6 spots and then a few feet away is valet. Really...valet for pizza...within feet from the door at that."}
{"text":"not worth the 1 hour wait for a deep dish pizza, the pizza was mostly thick cornmeal crust, plus waited for an hour to be seated on sun at 5p, party of 3, had to wait standing in the way of everybody coming & going, if you wanted a place to sit then go outside & sit in the sun if you lucky enough to find a place to sit! Got out of there 2.5 hours later. valet parking too, plus a tip,  more expensive then alot of other pizza places. if your a group of 15+ you can make a reservation, then no wait. Never again!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but food... terrible. A deep dish should come with SAUCE. I came two times thinking first was a fluke. Still... nothing changed. I'll never be back. Not to mention service wasn't best. I genuinely wish Hazelwoods would come back."}
{"text":"Gino's East was the place picked for July's International Supper Club UYE, and even though Gino's doesn't normally do reservations,(unless for parties of 10 or larger) we had no trouble getting a table.   Our server was friendly and helpful with menu, he knew his stuff, told us it was Wine Wednesday and that all bottles were  1/2 off, so we were sold!  Of course the table ordered a deep dish pizza, because that's why we were there, but that's not what I had. Just know up front it takes 45 minutes to an hour to cook a deep dish pizza, so quit complaining and enjoy your company!  I have a love hate affair with pizza, and sadly I know I don't like deep dish pizza, (to all my Chicago friends, I'm sorry) so while the table was ordering the pizza, I went with the deep dish nachos.  It was tortilla chips, refried beans, cheddar cheese, black olives and jalapenos all baked in a deep pan, I love when the cheese is just baked on to the chips! Simple but great tasting! It came with a side of salsa & sour cream. These nachos hit the spot!  If you are looking for deep dish pizza in Phoenix, go give Gino's a try!"}
{"text":"We got the thin sausage.  The crust was crispy but it was a little too thick.  The cheese was just ok.  The sauce is good. It was not hot when it came out.  I wonder if it was frozen or they waited too long to bring it out.  I won't go back...."}
{"text":"So I'll save the time of those that will ostracize me for it but I'm all about Lou Malnati's. I came here because I'm not a Chicago native and have friends that are and swear by this place. I wasn't disappointed. They are neck and neck in my book now. Who knows if someday Gino's might just win me over..? Authentic atmosphere, big screens for the sports, valet parking, and signatures on the walls! Service was great food was great. If you love deep dish you MUST give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Pizza a bit off. Not quite the same as my Gino's pizza in Chicago. A little bit too much corn meal. This through the taste off a bit! There is nothing like Chicago pizza, so this is the closest you will get in AZ."}
{"text":"I am a huge Mac and Cheese fan. It was delicious. Danielle was our server and gave a great smile and a laugh. It was busy, but she was on it!"}
{"text":"Great layout. Great food. Great service. Great addition to that growing area over on Indian school. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza and dessert! We had an issue with our appetizer, but our server (Juice) took care of it, and made sure we were well taken care of the rest of the evening. People don't leave nearly enough positive reviews when things are fixed! We'll be back! Thanks Ginos!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to try this place out for lunch and to be honest I was not that impressed. The pizza was mediocre at best and the service was extremely slow. Probably will not return as there are way too many other places that I would rather visit during my lunch hour."}
{"text":"I could not be more thrilled that they opened a location here. Perhaps another location could be north scottsdale area. I absolutely love the deep dish. Tastes exactly the same as in chicago. The deep dish takes longer because it's a deep dish. It's to be expected. I don't mind the wait at all. Extremely worth it. I plan on going to pick up some pizzas to take home soon. The service was great. The manager walked around making sure everyone was happy. Live music was good. Love the ambiance. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! Super long wait! We finally just left... This was our first visit to Gino's. My husband & I were really hungry, and when they said it would be a 30 min. wait, we almost left. But we decided to be patient because we went there for the music. Meanwhile, there was an empty booth just sitting there for about 20 min. = ??   When they finally called us, we were seated and in a few minutes, we ordered the deep dish pizza. Note: The waiter did NOT mention how long it was going to take - otherwise we would have gotten appetizers. Finally after about 30-40 min. we asked him about our order and he said he would check on it. Later he came back to finally explain the deep dish takes 45 min. to an hour to cook! If we had known that, we would have never ordered this, as we were starving. Oh yeah, and the waiter said it took that long to cook because it was cooked \"with love.\" lol. I will say that he tried his best, but he didn't seem to be in any hurry and I just don't think he was trained very well. Later, we got the hummus which had a lot of oil on top, and a small salad that was missing the tomatoes.   Finally, we started counting the minutes, and when it seemed as if we had been waiting for over an hour, we decided to leave. We went to the register and said we'd pay for the appetizers but we didn't want the pizza. Well, suddenly the pizza was going to be ready at that very moment! They said we could take it to go, but we said no. Honestly, I don't like doing this, but we had been more than patient long enough.  They were so disorganized that we even had to wait for change, as they couldn't seem to figure out how to take a cash payment. As we were leaving, they all acted confused with hardly any apologies.   Not to mention a \"valet\" - for a pizza place - seriously?? This isn't Las Vegas, lol. Luckily, we found a parking spot because we do not like strangers parking our car. The good news is that we didn't spend $30 on a pizza (that we discovered later) didn't look very appetizing.  Was there anything good? YES, the live music!! But they had to perform out in the heat (with some misters going) away from everyone, so it was hard to hear them inside.    In the meantime, this place needs to get advice on restaurant organizing, staff training, and how to cook pizzas quicker, like most places do. Plus, get better acoustics and a sound system so that the band can be heard inside. Or, better yet, let them play inside and stay cool! Anyway, if this restaurant doesn't make some serious changes, I don't think they will be in business for too long."}
{"text":"Great experience. Was leary based on previous reviews but definitely worth going. Service was great, food was wonderful. A little pricey for pizza but definitely great Chicago place."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to get seated right away. Our server was good and did inform us it would take 45 minutes for our deep dish pizza to bake. The manager came by and told us it might take 1 hour. I believe the 45 min time given was correct. Sadly the pizza did not live up to our expectations. As the server was cutting into our pizza to serve us, it just looked watery. The crust stood up to the toppings but the crust was tasteless. The cheese very stringy and the pizza itself was just ok. We have had deep dish many times elsewhere and it beats this pizza hands down.  Leftovers the next day and I had hoped the flavors would mesh but sadly only worse. I tossed out the leftovers and for someone who loves pizza and hates wasting calories on bad food, this was a regrettable experience."}
{"text":"Pizza really good but took like 40 min to arrive upon place being empty  waiter was cute   calamari was chewy Just another pizza place"}
{"text":"Had a party of 8 and after waiting 90 minutes, the hostess said our table was ready... two booths, one for 6 people, and the other for 2 people.  really????    Pizza was garbage.  Would have rather had a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"It was nothing like the Gino's back in Illinois.  The service was mediocre and the food was bland at best.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This chain serves the best pizza! Better than the one downtown Chicago.  Delish!!! Regina is the bomb!! Best waitress!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the NEW Gino's East Chicago Phoenix you have to go!!  The food was amazing, the staff was awesome. I had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, spicy Kale Ceasar salad, Chicago Fire deep dish Pizza (the deep dish takes a little longer but was worth the wait) It was all delicious!!"}
{"text":"Really!  Valet parking for a pizza place?  Plenty of open spots when we arrived for a dinner date but were not \"allowed\" to park on our own (even though the open spaces were before you got to the valet stand).  And that was just the start.  Friendly enough hostess and initial waiter, however, the host stand seemed to be a general meeting place for all staff to get some sort of instruction from the manager; right in front of awaiting customers trying to check in.  Waiter explained the time commitment to get a truly deep dish pie and we agreed since we were going to imbibe some adult beverages anyway.  Drinks were generous (I had a double vodka tonic) and the wait time turned out to be nearly exactly as explained.  Unfortunately, the food was not in the least worth waiting for.  Our deep dish pie was supposed to have sausage and olives in it.  My spouse started pushing her fork around the sauce (lukewarm, at best) and finally asked the waiter who explained that its all mixed in with the sauce.  We pointed out a pie at a table near ours with very visible sausages and vegetables and were told that was a different sort of pie.  I asked which one that was to be so different from ours and the waiter deferred to the manager who, before he got more than 10 words (none of which apologetic) out of his mouth; we excused ourselves; left money for the drinks, and departed.  We have since heard other not-so-kind reviews from friends and neighbors.  Rarely do we get a nearly unanimous input, one way or the other.  Will definitely not be back and will notify potential diners of the same."}
{"text":"Great pizza. It takes a lot of time, like an hour, but your patience will pay off in the end.  I love it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As a Midwest native, it is awesome that they finally opened out here in Phoenix. I can honestly say this is the best pizza you can get here.  The only issue I had is I kept calling so I could place my order and not wait for the pizza while it was being cooked and the phone rang and rang. When I got there, I verified that I had the correct number and they said others had complained about that as well."}
{"text":".Bad Bad Bad Bad bad customer service! We were seated and waited 10 minutes before our server came by to offer us water. We immediately placed our order knowing that a deep dish pizza takes 45min to 1hr. No problem...until the 2 tables who were  behind us waiting AND were seated 10-15  min after us received their deep dish before us.  Really??  When I called the waitress over she said \"oh ya I just noticed that.??\" WHAT??  She said she would check on it and left..we didn't see her again for 10 min. We finally got our pizza and when she came back over I asked her if she checked on why the parties seated after us got their pizza before us she said..oh I didn't even check.   OK then.  Granted it was Sunday night. No apology, no nothing. We couldn't enjoy what was good pizza with such bad service."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  The staff are all very friendly...we were seated immediately and the food came out hot and within 10 minutes of us ordering it."}
{"text":"Wow, I was so excited when I heard Gino's East was coming to the West coast! I googled weekly to find out exactly they were expected to open, since there had been a couple of delays! Finally, the date was announced and I thought, \"Yaaaasssss! I can't wait to eat my beloved Chicago Deep Pizza in the desert and reflect back my many childhood memories of driving to Chicago specially to shop and eat at Gino's East!\" I remember sitting in the booths with patron's signatures and graffiti  scribbled all over the walls! Ah yes! Those were the days! But I digress! Back to reality....I was sooooo incredibly disappointed that there aren't enough adjectives to express my frustration! I really don't remember the sauce being that sweet! It ruined the whole pizza for me!  Plus, the so called spicy sausage was NOT spicy, the sausage patty was small and the crust a tad dry and brittle! Oh the pain and anguish I suffered after having my childhood memories nearly erased!! #wontBeBack"}
{"text":"Best pizza of any restaurant anywhere ... Chicago deep dish from Gino's East."}
{"text":"Nothing like the Gino's in Chicago.   We had a table for 5.  Drink orders for the first 3 people came.  The other two placed their order when the first 3 drinks arrived.  The 2 drinks were forgotten and had to be re-ordered.   Refills of water glasses had to be requested. There were only three tables in use in the middle of the afternoon when we went. They do have good drinks, when you get them. We ordered artichoke dip, which was great, and nachos.  The nachos were ok, not much on the chips besides cheese and jalapeno's. There are much better nachos with more toppings at other restaurants.    We ordered a large thin crust pizza for our main dish.  When it came the outer crust was so hard you could not bite through it.  There are so many better restaurants in this neighborhood to try and much better pizza restaurants elsewhere.  With so many better options available, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Well let me start with, I guess this is what you get for going to a pizza place and not getting pizza. I ordered the wings and zucchini pasta. They ran out of wings so I can't review those, but really? No wings? Anyway, the zucchini pasta was terrible. Bland and tasteless. I never, literally never, salt anything but I was pouring on the seasoning to try to add some flavor to the \"pasta.\" My boyfriend had the thin crust pizza but states it was really good. Service was good. I think next time I return, I'll splurge and get the pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic night! I am a native of Chicago so I was very pleased to finally check out the Phoenix location. I shared the Chopped Salad and a Medium Supreme pizza with my friends. It was delicious and just enough food for the four of us. As an added bonus Gino's had live entertainment on the enclosed patio. House of Stairs. They played kind of a funky jazz set. Amazing vibe! Had a great time"}
{"text":"The staff is always absolutely amazing. I adore the bartender Justin and the bar manager Kelly. Every time I walk through the door, I am greeted with smiles and laughter. I absolutely love pizza and Arizona didn't have anything good to offer until Ginos opened in May."}
{"text":"I've being wanting to try their pizza, but when I look them up online there's at least an hour wait.  Way too long if ordering for dinner.  So today I was need them and I figured way not stop in and order a pizza for delivery and go on home.  Turns out they don't delivery, even though their truck says that.  My choices were order the pizza, pay for it, and go home and have them call me when it ready for pick up.  Nothing says good service like inconveniencing the customer.  The other choice was go home and order it online thru a third party payor, for a fee, and have it delivered that way.  Sorry neither way is acceptable so I guess I've never try their pizza."}
{"text":"First visit yesterday and the pizza was great.  My wife and I split a medium and I am glad as we get to split the leftovers tonight."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I'm so over the deep dish \"boom\" that's blanketed The Valley since 2016. After Malnati's last summer and Giordano's last winter, Gino's East is a bit late to the party, wouldn't you say?   I mean, we've already had two massively hyped Chicago-based chains open up their pizzerias in Phoenix. And honestly, both of them had me seriously questioning the credibility of Chicago cuisine. So with Gino's, I didn't really have high expectations. After all, like its competitors, Gino's is a chain - and I can't name too many chains (if any) that serve up a pizza that's anything beyond average. And better yet, what's with all these reviewers acting as if deep dish pizza didn't exist in Phoenix until now?   Anyway . . .   With Gino's, I expected the usual procedures. Incredibly long wait times, pre-ordering process - wait, where's the tacky faux-distressed marquee sign like the ones found at Malnati's and Giordano's? Oh, they don't have one! Maybe this is a sign that this experience is going to be different, eh?  We were quoted a 90 minute wait time during peak hours on Saturday night. It ended up being closer to an hour, with a standard 45 minute wait for the pizza. I wish people would stop complaining about this. This is standard procedure at all restaurants that serve legitimate deep dish. There is no pre-ordering while you're waiting for your table, but based on past experience, it makes minimal difference - even if it might make things more convenient for the kitchen staff.  We started with some mozzarella sticks. I honestly cannot recall the last time I actually ordered these in a restaurant, but they were actually very good - not that mozz sticks are rocket science by any means.  I was a bit intrigued when I read that what sets Gino's apart from Malnati's and Giordano's is their crust, which has a cornmeal-type flavor to it. So, we decided to order our usual pepperoni deep-dish to see how well it compares to what we've tried in the past.  Gino's is similar to Giordano's in the sense that, they include the toppings on the bottom, while \"icing\" the top of the pie with tomato sauce. Topping quality was okay, but my girlfriend and I were both taken back that the pizza's crust base (not the edge - but the base itself) had a bizarre cracker-like crunch to it with zero chew. It would just break apart with each cut or bite, which just seemed kind of odd. And yes, as I expected, the crust is indeed unique, although I'm not entirely sure if that's a good thing. The texture, which is similar to cornmeal/cornbread is different, but I wouldn't necessarily call it an enhancement. It's just simply a different \"take\" on what we've become accustomed to. My girlfriend felt that it actually tasted a bit better after the dough \"settled\" for a bit and became less crumbly. Personally, I could barely handle eating more than one slice, which is usually the case with deep dish pizzas.   So, how does it compare to its competitors? The server was friendly and the prices are reasonable, but I find most of these \"famous\" deep dish chains to be over-hyped joints that are deemed \"exotic\" just because they're from Chicago. And we all know how much people in Phoenix are obsessed with anything from Chicago.  Is it worth trying? Sure. I see no reason not to. But I think in terms of this whole deep dish craze that we're currently going through, it's not really anything significantly better or worse than what can be obtained elsewhere.  Nevertheless, at least try them out."}
{"text":"What a fantastic new restaurant!! It's like our very own Cheers, but with fabulous food!! The deep dish pizza is to die for!! Love the decor, and appetizers were wonderful!! Owners are lovely people, and super-nice and friendly!! This was our first time, as it's brand new, but it sure won't be our last!! Try it, you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"We've seen this place and always wanted to try it out. We learned that it's not the best date night place for a young couple.   Pizza was really good! Got a deep dish sausage pizza. Could have had more cheese, and the crust is so large you would think they could offer garlic butter to dip it in, but no.  Service was good but our server was a bit odd. He introduced himself as Ricky Bobby and then we overheard him telling other servers \"Shake and bake.\" (From Talladega Nights if anyone isn't familiar.) He was a bit intense with eye contact and I wasn't 100% comfortable.  Environment wasn't the best. Our table was right in line with their drink counter and close to the kitchen, so there were plenty of staff walking by constantly. A full-on view of a black kitchen non-slip mat and the water station isn't exactly the ambiance I look for in a restaurant. At some point they turned the TVs on really loudly, and all I could hear was commercials blasted into my ears because the baseball game hadn't even come on yet. Also plenty of kids and the occasional crying baby."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! They finally made it happen. Real Deep Dish in AZ. We had the Chicago Fire deep dish with spicy sausage, fire roasted peppers, and Red onion. The artichoke Parmesan thin crust was out of this world. Artichoke, Garlic, Lemon, Parmesan, mozzarella.. that is an amazing creation."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience, but not great, either. We came on a Tuesday for the $30 special, which includes pizza, salad, mozzarella sticks and drinks for four. We ordered a deep dish and an additional thin crust pizza. The salad came with WAY too much salad dressing on it. Not one of us enjoyed it because it was literally drenched in dressing. As for the pizza, unfortunately, these servers must still be rookies. Deep dish pizza takes a while to cook. We know that. Imagine our surprise when they brought our thin crust pizza out 20 minutes before the deep dish pizza was ready. Half of our party was done eating by the time the deep dish came out. I wish they would have asked us if we wanted our thin crust pizza right away rather than just assume we did. Given the option, we would have preferred to all eat at the same time. Isn't that the point of enjoying a meal out, together?"}
{"text":"Just as I remembered from Chicago!  We ordered the Chicago dog and deep dish sausage pizza.  It was fun signing the wall and being apart of a community! Everything was delicious, the atmosphere was just like being in Chicago! We needed a place like this in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I honestly have a mixed feeling review about this place.  One thing that was superb... the service!  Our waitress was super friendly.  She was informative about their process (time to cook deepdish), and checked in on us at appropriate times.  What was lacking was the food.  We ordered the nachos.  Maybe we read it too fast, but we kind of expected more on an Italian inspired dish.  Mozzarella, pepperchinis, shredded pepperoni, etc...  but what came were more Mexican in nature.  The pizza, well... was a mess.  I guess that's just how chicago pizza is...?  It did taste good.  But to the eye, it just looked like a pile of ingredients and some sauce.  So maybe chicago style just isn't for us...?"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing!! Slow service, soggy and flavorless pizza that we waited over an hour for. Lou's is wayyyyy better!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend to try their infamous Chicago-style deep dish pizza and was not disappointed! Our server recommended we get a small to share between two (pizza loving) people and surprisingly it was more than enough. We even had leftovers. The pizza was delicious but definitely required a fork and knife to eat... I'm not familiar with deep dish (terrible I know) so it seemed like kind of a casserole-pizza hybrid to me but I was more than okay with that. We also split the spicy kale caesar salad for an app, which was good and not too spicy.  They did warn us that the deep dish pizzas take approximately 45 mins to be ready, so don't come in a hurry and if you are, choose your pizza first then order your app and drinks.   I will come back here again when I'm hungry and craving some deep dish and beer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I live in Mesa, and was shopping in Phoenix across from Gino's East. I placed my order by phone, deep dish sausage pizza knowing it takes about an hour it was perfect I could do some shopping and swing by and pick up my pizza.   Customer service on the phone was excellent. I arrived about 1hr after placing my order, they have plenty of parking for pickup, also for dine in there is valet which is an excellent idea since parking lot is towards the back of the property.   I was greeted with a friendly smile from the hostess, I was informed my pizza had just arrived up front. I paid my bill, and the girl brought out my pizza and let me look at it before I left. It looked amazing and smelled delish !  The aroma from the pizza box enticed me the 20 minute drive home. We reheated the pizza in warm over and it was EXCELLENT.   My hubs is from Chicago, I was introduced to Chicago pizza over 30 yrs ago and it is amazing. My favorite Chicago Pizza is Nancy's Deep Dish, Gino's East  is a close second.   We are so happy that Gino's East has come West."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my husband and another couple for dinner last night. Were told it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait so we headed to Undertow and Sip next door to wait. After over an hour we hadn't heard back we headed back to Gino's to find that there was a glitch and our reservation was lost. We were seated fairly quickly at that point and our waitress Skyler was friendly and attentive. We ordered wings, which everyone really enjoyed. We also tried the ceasar salad, margarita thin crust and peperoni thick crust. We missed a bit more cheese on the margarita but there was plenty on the deep dish to pick off. Good sauce, a bit pricey but we all left with take-away bags. We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!!! Probably one if the best around. Neat restaurant. We have been here a couple times and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Even though our waitress (Regina) was great, I can't get over the fact that I had a long hair in my 1st slice of pizza. This ruined the experience for me and my kids...We left hungry...gonna be tough to go back, especially being that I'm from Chicago.  Totally bummed as I was looking forward to eating here...I guess it will be Lou Malnatti's next time!"}
{"text":"Our server: \"Remember what your momma said... Shake n' Bake, and Lou Malnati's is The Devil.\"  I've actually had the Big Three while I've been in Chicago: Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's and out of the three Gino's is my favorite. The reason? The cornmeal crust. I love that additional hit of texture and toasty corn flavor. The heartiness of the crust holds up the best with the hefty amount of toppings that are on a Chicago deep dish pizza.   So, we tried to eat here on a weekend but:  1. There was a 1 hour wait for a table for two 2. The parking lot was full and we were a little irked about having to use a valet even though it was free (Call me weird but I don't like having strangers drive my car even if it's just to park it)  So, we decided to eat somewhere else and come back later.   Fast forward to a month or so later, we decide to eat here on a random Tuesday night in August but as a party of 5. The more pizza the merrier!  No wait, plenty of tables available. Also plenty of parking and no need for a valet. Whew!  The other benefit about dining here on Tuesday is that all desserts are half price! So, we made a conscious effort to save room for dessert despite ordering a ton of food for dinner. Since the deep dish pizzas will take 30-40 minutes to make, we started with a few appetizers (Artichoke dip, spinach mozzarella sticks) and shared the buffalo chicken mac and cheese. I wasn't a big fan of the artichoke dip but I enjoyed the crispy crunchy breading of the soft mozzarella cheese and spinach sticks. The buffalo chicken was equally enjoyable, with crispy crunchy breading, tender juicy chicken, and 2 different types of pasta with creamy cheesy sauce.  We split the Chicago fire, meaty legend, and spinach Margarita, all small size. With all the appetizers we probably could have been good with just 2 deep dish pizzas but I did enjoy having all the variety. My favorite of the three was the Chicago Fire. My slice had an entire shelf of sausage layered on top of the pizza, and I enjoyed the sauce, cheese, red onions and super spicy peppers (I think they possibly used Hatch chiles?). The meaty legend had a generous amount of meat on it but all the flavors ended up being a bit too salty for me. The spinach Margarita had very nice fresh ingredients but I think the delicate flavors were at odds with the hearty nature of Chicago deep dish pizza itself.   For dessert, we had the beignets ($2 on Tuesday!) and tiramisu ($3 on Tuesday!). Out of the two I enjoyed the tiramisu more for the beignet I had was a little gooey/very slightly undercooked on the inside and had a hard crust on the outside. There was a bit too much cinnamon sugar on it for me and it actually tasted more like a round churro than a beignet. The tiramisu was a wedge shaped piece, creamy, lightly sweet and dense.  Our server was awesome and he was funny, cool, and did a great job checking up on us and refilling drinks.  Our total with all that food ended up being around $25 per person including tax and tip for a party of 5.   I'd definitely come here again for that deep dish when there's no wait for a table."}
{"text":"Having been to the original Gino's East many times, I was excited to try the AZ version. We didn't have time for the 45 min deep dish so ordered the regular.  We were  not impressed. The crust was spongy and the sausage had no taste. In fact, I've had better sausage on frozen pizzas. The left overs just sat in the fridge and eventually were tossed.That would never happen with a Grimaldi's thin crust, leftovers would be gone for breakfast. I'll give them another shot when I have time for the deep dish."}
{"text":"We originally placed a pick up order - and it was not correct.   We contacted the restaurant.   Rick immediately compensated us and treated us to another dinner.   The service and food was amazing.    Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese was great.  Mozzarella sticks - not greasy and yummy!    The best....   deep dish pizza with sausage patty that covered the entire base of pizza.   We added spicy pepperoni to it too.   SO good.   Rick checked on us throughout the evening.   I will definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"All my chicago friends talk about how great Gino's is, and have been so excited for the first Phx restaurant to open!!!  The deep dish was well worth the wait. It's all about the cheese and the water lol. Great Mozzarella sticks, salad, and tried a few of their delicious specialty cocktails.  Fun friendly staff with awesome recommendations on what to try. Loved the atmosphere and decor, plenty of flat screen TVs, and can't wait for the patio area to open with live music to come!! All the Chicago people are in heaven now and I'll be back very soon as a regular. Yum!"}
{"text":"Well my wife's family is from Chicago and we end up driving all over the place for deep dish that is from Chicago. Well if your looking for some great pizza and good service please visit Gino's East. The food was amazing. From all the pizza we have eaten this by far was the best one we have had from the so called great places that have moved out here. The sauce was perfect the ingredients were fresh. Regina was very attentive and was wonderful with our party of 14. We can't wait to come back again and frequent this place. When you come ask for a Regina she is an amazing person."}
{"text":"All of the good Chicago restaurants are coming to Phoenix or already here.  Little Chicago over here!   I had the Buffalo wings. They were pretty good! I also ate the crust of the , (wife didn't easy the crust. It was very tasty! Corn bread crust. Yum.   I'll update my review when I have the full pizza!  To be continued.."}
{"text":"The spicy kale salad was very good. The price seemed reasonable for an \"entre \" size, at least it did before it arrived at the table. The portion size was positively skimpy. So I felt ripped off on that front. The deep dish pizza was just OK. The crust was rather bland and a bit overdone. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. The amount of cheese and toppings was adequate. Also, was up with the stale, powdery Parmesan cheese product for the table? My favorite place has wonderful, freshly grated cheese. Overall, it was not worth the price.  On the upside, the wait staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Being from Illinois and enjoying Gino's East (my favorite Chicago deep-dish) many many times, I was thrilled it came to my new home here in Phoenix. I tried this location for the first time and it was just as I had it in Chicago. I am extremely satisfied. We had the spinach artichoke dip for  an appetizer and it was very yummy. Then of course we got a deep dish pizza which was absolutely delicious! Again, it was just like what would enjoy in Illinois - the sauce tasted wonderful and I'm still in love with the cornmeal crust. I even like that they are continuing with writing on the walls. The service was very good too. We were well attended by our waiter, never had an empty glass, unused dishes were quickly moved out of the way, and the manger even came around to make sure we were doing fine. I will be coming back a bunch."}
{"text":"Had tbe deep dish it was great also had the thin crust .. loved it . Apps. Were good also .looki g forward to getting take out but. Ot till june they say"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza for takeout tonight and I can't say I had a great experience. When the pizza was brought in the front door, I wasn't greeted with an amazing pizza smell. I smelled something similar to a sour dish towel. Against better judgement, I still ate the pizza and well, the sour dish towel smell/taste (not that I often suck on sour dish towels, but you know...) never seemed to go away. I couldn't tell if it was the cheese, the sausage, or the veggies, but it was horrible.   Additionally, we ordered the spinach sticks. They were still crispy, even after being drive a couple miles back to our house which is a huge plus, but they tasted almost fishy. I love a fried food stick, but I couldn't even eat a whole one of these even after smothering it in marinara. Very disappointing.   Lastly, we ordered a Caesar salad. It was a Caesar salad. The lettuce was a bit limp, but I definitely ate more of this to fill the void from the sour dish towel pizza and fishy spinach sticks.   The leftover pizza took its revenge on me though as when I went to put it back in the box, it fell on the floor and my foot causing a tomato-y mess. That isn't the fault of Gino's East though. Clumsy me."}
{"text":"Had NO idea that this place was there until today when I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop in for lunch. The special I had came with a salad, a drink, and a deep dish pizza (other options available too) for $8. The pizza was one of the BEST I've had in Phoenix, no doubt!! Soooooo good!! My server today was Michael and he was AWESOME! He is fun and personable and is definitely good at his job! There was another guy working there with blonde hair who was very nice too...didn't catch his name though. I'll be back VERY soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night to a cold beer and a baseball game and I was really disappointed by the service. I had ordered my pizza about 20 minutes before another couple sat down and ordered and my food arrived the same time as theirs. It would've been nice if they brought out my food around before the couple that sat down after me. The food was okay not great, I ordered a  chi talian stallion and it was a little bit on the spicy end, but I made do.    The ambiance is pretty cool, you can sign your name on one of the walls which is a nice gesture and the live music on a Friday night kind of made it difficult to enjoy watching a game or having a nice conversation with family or friends. But I imagine it's completely different when there is no live music. Overall I was somewhat unimpressed with the service and the food definitely takes a while for it to make."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere and great service.  Our table had a few pizzas but I had the thin crust Chi-talian Stallion and it was awesome.  We came with a large group and were well taken care.  They accommodated the vegetarian and gluten free members of our group and had our food ready promptly.  Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"My true rating would be 3.5 stars, but since that's not possible I'll just round up.   Some friends and I decided to check this place out on a nice windy Saturday evening. I was super excited to try it since I do love the one in Chicago and anyone who knows me knows I'm a huge pizza lover; especially deep dish.   Our wait was about an hour, so after standing around for a little while, one of the girls told us we can hang out on the patio and enjoy a drink and live music. FAB! They should probably just make that a seating area, then the wait time might be less? We hung out there enjoying some blackberry beer and raspberry beer until our table was good to go.  Upon getting seated, we ordered chicken wangs, artichoke dip and deep dish nachos. Wangs were good. They needed to be a little more well done. Artichoke dip was AMAZING! Definitely my favorite out of the apps, but also my fav I think ever! The nachos were underwhelming because it lacked something but I like nachos so I munched on it. My friend and I got the spinach margherita. It was GOOD. I enjoyed it. BUT, it does not compare to the on in Chicago. The sauce at Gino's in Chicago is garlicky and tangy, while this was more tomatoey and sweet. I'm not a fan of sweet sauce.   Overall, I liked Gino's. It's no what rhymes with FOU NALMATIS, but it does the trick and I'm happy it's in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here several days ago. The ONLY issue with this place is the forced valet, as your only parking option! You guys need to put this on your web site, and the signage needs help also. We were not expecting this, and were not prepared. Kids etc.. Obviously the lot is tiny, and they are relying upon the attendant( single) to double park etc..to fit more cars. Their first impression and it was lasting until the pizza came was annoyance. Better off parking in a near by plaza in terms of convenience! The pizza was good, the service was ok, and place was clean."}
{"text":"I will have to say this place is just average. Nice ambience, mom was alive man the night we went. Pizza quality was average not great. Think I will stick to the other Chicago style joint on first and Camelback. More authentic, better sauce, better toppings."}
{"text":"I can't.  I just cannot.  Give more stars, that is.  So, here is the update.  I was thinking the other day, it would be nice to give Ginos another try, maybe they've worked out the kinks.  I decided not to, simply because I didn't want to have to pay for parking.    This morning, I'm at Safeway.  Yes, the grocery store.  Walking by the frozen pizza case, I could not help but notice, frozen Gino's Pizza.  It was only $9.  I thought, what the heck, I\"ll give it a try - at least I will know it's cooked properly when I do it myself.  So I grabbed it.  And a bag of organic shredded Italian mix cheese.  Brought the pie home and cooked it for the recommended 50 minutes.  It didn't look quite done, so I added some of the shredded cheese, a sprinkling of red pepper flakes and popped it back in for ten minutes.  The pie came out looking delicious.  I let it sit for five minutes, then cut into it.  As you can see from the picture, the cheese behaved like the server hoped it would the first time I ate in the restaurant.  This frozen pie was delicious.  The crust was perfectly crunchy, and the filling was hot and flavorful, with the little bit of added cheese, it was cheesy, tomato-ey goodness.  Heck I would buy this pie again.  From the freezer though, as it was less than half the price of what you can get at the actual restaurant.  Even better, Safeway does not have Valet and they do have a wing bar.  I'm sold.  On the frozen pie that is.  Don't think I\"ll be going back to the restaurant.  At least not the one in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ginos East was just Okay.  We knew that it just opened for less than a week.  The staff was friendly but the pizza was disappointing.  Our large deep dish pizza that we waited for 2 hours was thin.    It wasn't as deep from what I had in Chicago a month ago.   Also they were out of the deep dish nachos that we also waited 30 mins for.    Need lots of improvements.   Also, you can't preorder your pizza while waiting just yet."}
{"text":"Was disappointed that there wasn't more sausage in the small works deep pan pizza for the amount of money I paid!  Very pricey deep pan pizza!  Won't go back!  I could have had a steak dinner at Outback Steakhouse for what I paid for a small deep pan pizza!  The value just wasn't there!    They don't aim to please!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today since the parking lot was pretty empty. We got seated right away. Our waiter from the get go was unfriendly and truly seemed miserable. Without even greeting us or asking if we'd eaten there before he simply said if you want deep dish you need to order it now because it takes 45 minutes to an hour. My husband told him ok, well give us a few minutes to look at the menu. Throughout our time at the restaurant our waiter was short, curt and simply uninterested in providing customer service. I felt uncomfortable every time he came to the table. I know they just opened and have been busy but the staff should be sharing the excitement of the neighborhood in finally being open.   Next let me talk about the pizza. For me personally I would've rather eaten a $5 frozen pizza. The whole thing tasted bland. The most flavorful part of the pizza was the tomato sauce. We ordered the Gino's Supreme and it wasn't very supreme. I had 1 mushroom on my two slices that I could identify and ZERO sausage. I felt like I was eating crust, cheese and tomato sauce. For me the crust was just ok, nice crunch but no flavor, very bland. I missed having mushrooms and sausage that I could not only see but taste and enjoy.   For my husband and I, we won't be back. Many of my co-workers have been dying to order one for pick up and I've started sharing with them that it's not worth the money and definitely doesn't live up to the hype. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  I thought with all the renovations that were done it was going to be amazing,  it is unimpressive. The thin crust pizza had a good crust and I liked the red sauce, a nice fresh flavor. The WORST part of the experience was the annoying obnoxious waiter Tommy,  from the moment we were seated he was just too much.  starting with \" Do you need me to order for you or do you think you know what you are doing?\"  It seemed he thought he was the big personality of the place.  Constantly interrupting our conversation,  not to ask what we wanted but to let us know what was HIS favorite.  He was just too cool for us.   Noticed music selection did not fit the patrons.  I Guess because we were not from \"Chi town\" like he was . The menu was small.  Good luck, too many good restaurants in the neighborhood.  I will take my $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza is better.   Disappointing.  Not like in Chicago.  We were very excited to try a classic Chicago pizza place that made its way to Phoenix.  We have been to the Gino's in Chicago. We ordered the thin crust pizza to save time.  It took just as long as deep dish and was burned on the bottom and had no taste.  They should be able to make all types of good pizza.  The server was slow and disappeared for 30 minutes leaving us there waiting there to get the check and leave.  A few of the staff said they had moved from Chicago to work there.  How could they have lost that much quality control?    Nothing special about this place.  I would not go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Now I know why Gino's East has only three stars.  Very disappointing pizza.  No flavor and they had to remake one due to someone who had a hard time reading.  Won't be going back !"}
{"text":"Place was great!! Our server, I believe her name was Taylor, was beyond amazing. She knew her stuff and you could tell she enjoyed working there. We took her advice and ordered mozzarella sticks, spinach dip and deep dish pizza. It was all piping hot, fresh and beyond expectations. My husband and I indulged in the apple crumble and yeah, it was worth it!! Can't say the surrounding neighborhood was pleasant but we will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Our server told us that a thin crust pizza would take 30 minutes. It took an hour and two minutes, and this was a Tuesday evening with few other customers. The pizza arrived from the kitchen with the top of the dough raw, leading us to conclude that they had tried to rush it through after the order had been forgotten. I don't know, but neither the server nor the host were forthcoming about the cause for the overall terrible service.   Hazelwood's used to occupy this lot. The neighborhood was better off when it was still there."}
{"text":"Love the crust!  Make sure you get the full pizza size sausage.  It is best at Gino's, but carry out is still really good:"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Hospitable team ready to serve up some authentic Chicago style food! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Oh man. I loved this pizza. I got the deep dish Supreme with pepperoni and the sauce is a bit sweeter than I'm used to but it's so delicious. Hands down, this crust is amazing. It's nice and crispy, not soggy and tastes so good. I was impressed. My mom on the other hand didn't really like the pizza (so she says)."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a Chicago flair.  The pizza is certainly better then the other places around Phoenx.  It takes 30-40 minutes for a pizza order, but it is worth the wait.     Great staff with excellent service."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and have eaten at the original Gino's East hundreds of times. The pizza was undercooked and came out luke warm. Too gooey!   Service is poor and ambiance is non-existent. I was a solo customer and got shuffled off to a seat at the bar because \" we're booked up\". What b.s.; there were more than a half dozen empty booths and tables and 40 empty seats on the patio. It doesn't take customers long to realize that they are not important here. Live entertainment was fine, but a little too loud.   This is not Chicago hospitality."}
{"text":"I used to frequent one of the original Gino's East in Chicago waaay back in the 80's. I'm not sure this is *quite* as good as I remember, but if not it's really close, and to boot they had plenty of good local beers on draft. I saw some reviews complaining about valet parking - that must have changed, as we self parked and had no problem. Pro tip: bring some kind of permanent marker to write on the walls, as it's not only allowed by encouraged!"}
{"text":"My husband used to live in Chicago and ate at Gino's all the time. He was sooo excited they opened up shop here. He was so disappointed when we got the pie home and we started eating it. We got the deep dish, it was 1/2\" thick. Sausage has no flavor. Sauce has no flavor, tastes like they poured a can of tomato sauce on it for the sauce. Crust was not even edible. This is not the same pizza you get in Chicago in any way shape or form."}
{"text":"Great spot for sports watching, ice cold beer and great food.  Above all, some of the best customer service I have ever experienced.  I give this place a full 5 star rating recommendation.  Well deserved Ryan."}
{"text":"I saw the sign for Gino's East a few weeks ago when I'd just moved to the area and couldn't wait to visit. My gf is from Chicago and she raves about Chicago style pizza and especially Gino's East. We always visit their original location back in Chicago. So, once Gino's here in Phoenix opened up we couldn't wait to check it out. My gf ordered the Gino's supreme deep dish as it takes about 45min, it's recommended you place your order for deep dish first even before getting drinks/appetizers btw. For starters we opted for the Caesar salad and Spinach cheese sticks. Both were great! The cheese sticks actually have a nice bit of spinach on the inside so that was good. Our server asked if we wanted my thin crust pizza at the same time as the deep dish and even though we said yes, it was ready about 10min before. Although we were given the option to hold it or bring it out, I opted for them to bring it out because I didn't want my pizza sitting there for 10min possibly getting cold or at least not as fresh as it could be. I gotta say, it hurts me to say this because I LOVE pizza but it was a bit disappointing because for $17 ($2 additional for subbing regular tomato slices on a margarita Really?) it was just eh. Let me explain, the sauce is great, it had fresh basil and lovely tomatoes and fresh mozzarella but the crust tasted like cheap frozen french bread pizza, it's just tasteless and a bit crunchy/hard, in other words just bland and boring (for me). I usually love getting margarita pizza's and love the hand tossed, thin crust and brick oven styled pizzas and never complain about the crust but it really makes the pizza. Anyways, the supreme deep dish came and my gf said she was disappointed as well, mainly because the veggies and sausage were diced so small it becomes more a part of the sauce rather than a topping. She also mentioned it didn't taste at all like what she remembers in Chicago. Oh well...bummer because the vibe is cool, the service was excellent actually and we were really looking forward to dining here. Also, for the price, we both felt it was a bit high considering the meal was just ok. I'm actually surprised to see the place only had 3 stars just a couple weeks after opening and was hoping to give them a big 5 because I love to see new businesses succeed however, it was just a 3 cause of the food. I think you'll either love it or leave it, check it out if you love deep dish pizzas but if you order thin crust, be warned."}
{"text":"We walked in and were told it was a 15 minute wait at 5:51... which was reasonable.  There were two people waiting in the lobby when we walked in.  It is Father's Day and my husband wanted to make sure he got the Chicago deep dish pizza he had been craving, so we put in the order while we waited for our table.  We were seated about 25 minutes later.  Ok, I can handle that.  It took quite some time for a waitress to come by.  We told her we put in the deep dish order and ordered a salad and a regular thin crust pizza (I wanted the zucchini pasta but they were all out by 6:30... lame!).  We waited, and waited, and waited.  The waitress periodically came by to tell us how incredibly busy they were.  So, I'm not sure what she thinks busy is, but maybe 5 parties were waiting for a table at their busiest point.  She brought my entree salad out with the breadsticks (which took at least 20 minutes).  About 20 minutes later came the thin crust and the deep dish came  OVERCOOKED at 7:20!!!!  1 1/2 hrs after we ordered it!!!!  Shoot me now!  (Why on earth would we all want to eat together?). We overheard another waiter telling guests that 2 of the 5 cooks never showed up.  Not sure why our waitress blamed the \"incredibly busy\" evening.  Long before our pizza ever came there were at least 5 empty tables.  Finally the manager came by and brought some dough balls and told us she was comping the pizza.  For this I will give you two stars.  The food was decent, but next time LOU MALNATI'S HERE WE COME!  P.S.... I don't think I've ever left a bad review"}
{"text":"I was expecting nothing but greatness since my s/o has visited Ginos east in Chicago. I'm very disappointed with my first visit with this Phoenix location. We were sat after a group that arrived 20 minutes after us. They got their deep dish 20 minutes before we did and ended up waiting well over 1 hour for ours. Our thin crust was piping hot and our deep dish was barely warm. Will never return unfortunately.  Staff was kind but not the happiest.   Only Pro, mozzarella sticks good"}
{"text":"i grew up just south of chicago and this place took me back there. amazing food and great service and great decor. i will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My money is on this place not being open within 2-3 years. just nothing special here, EXCEPT, the Mozzarella Sticks, oh my!  Ginos knows how to keep a cheese stick CRISPY!!! That said, the breading could have used a little more flavor, but aside from that they were spectacular! Now on to the more mundane fare. Arizona isnt exactly overflowing with Chicago pizza fans, that said, theres room for maybe 1 or 2 chains to succeed here, and sadly, I dont think Ginos east is one of them. Next to Lou Malnatis it just pales in comparison. This is the desert, we eat a lot of salads here, we love cool refreshing fare with interesting toppings and flavorful dressings. Ginos has made the critical mistake of having a mediocre Caesar salad, which is sad, because their Caesar Salad has a wonderful dressing, but those scarce, tiny, diced up pieces of dry chicken are not flavorful or impressive. I truly hope their other salad offerings are better than the Caesar salad. On to dessert, well, I felt like we just kept ordering in search of SOMETHING that would end the experience on a positive note. But for that to happen we would have had to leave right after the Mozzarella sticks, because it was all downhill after that. The Chocolate cake was some mousse-like concoction that failed to satisfy on all levels, way too sugary, and the mousse was not creamy or smooth. I kept wondering if some stray ingredient (like cracker crumbs) had fallen into the mousse when they were making it. The Sugar balls were disgusting, bland under cooked and served with a small cup of what seemed like pancake syrup, yuck.   Oh, and I almost forgot, the PIZZA!!! So, if you think Ginos can hold a candle to Lou Malnatis, youre wrong! One thing Lou Malnatis got right is the crust, it stays crisp while youre eating it, Ginos does not. The crust on the Ginos pizza went soggy quickly, and it was so loaded with onions, you would have thought we had ordered an onion pizza instead of the Supreme.       So there you have it, my prediction for Ginos East is demise..."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese w/ frank sauce chicken! Deep dish Pizza just marginal. I will go back for mac though!  Service was great and very clean."}
{"text":"We started with the calamari. Cooked perfectly but needed salt, easily fixed. I had the Worth the Wait cocktail. It was stirred. Another bartender prepared it shaken. So I asked why the difference. Bartender said she was not sure?  Now for the pizza. Ordered the Supreme thin crust. Crust was too tough. Tasted old. Worst part it took over 45 minutes. I was thinking that they were preparing a deep dish. We had to ask bartender to follow up.    Service was so-so. Last time I go to a deep-dish restaurant for a thin crust.   Left disappointed :("}
{"text":"Sorry to say \"This is not the style and taste of Chicago's original Gino's East on Superior St.\" Very disappointing based on a unfavorable taste and texture. Living now in the Phoenix area I really was hoping they would get it right. The sauce is defiantly not cooked right or not at all, the ingredients are sparse thus making me feel I paid a premium price just to say I was there. The only one thing I can say is the service was good. My impression is, they did not take the time of effort making sure the recipe matched that of their Chicago location. I will not return to Phoenix Gino's East location. They should have and had an opportunity to take a lesson from Lou Malnati's who opened a location here in Phoenix and did take the time to get it right! Thanks Lou!"}
{"text":"I have been working with catering manager (Robert) and he is very professional and prompt in his responses.  Some of our friends recommended this restaurant for our event.  Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and now Gino's East.  The Chicago Trifecta!    I had been to the other ones, but had yet to come down this way.  Decided to meet up with an old friend here for lunch.  We arrived right after 11am and were one of the first people in the joint.  He had gotten there before me, so he went in and placed our order for a Large Meaty Legend (The pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook).  When I arrived, he was seated at a booth and I went to go join him.  About that.....if you are a larger person, the booths are tiny!  We quickly realized we were both uncomfortable, and moved to a table.  Much, much better!  Our waitress, Regina, came by and took our drink order and explained a little about the menu, appetizers, happy hour etc.  I ordered a Coke to drink and then we waited for our pizza to arrive.  About 35 minutes into our lunch, Regina came out with a pizza.  It looked a little bit smaller than a large, and she let us know that the kitchen made an error, and thought our pizza was a medium.  Honestly, no big deal, and a medium is PLENTY for 2 guys to share (with leftovers).  Check this out, though.....she let us know that since it was their error, that we could eat the medium one she brought out for us, AND they were cooking our large one to take home.  Did I hear that right?  Did I see Santa Claus outside on the roof?  Did Christmas move to September?  How awesome was that?  They didn't have to do that, but they did!  That right there is part of this 5 star rating.  They made a mistake, owned up to it, and proactively solved it on the fly.  I wish more businesses were like that!  Awesome, awesome gesture and we really appreciated it!  Now onto the pizza......................  Medium Meaty Legend- (I say medium, because that is what we ate....we got our large one boxed up to go). We went with this one because it is their house specialty.  It comes with pepperoni, sausage, Canadian bacon, and regular bacon. This thing was a BEAST!  The very first thing I noticed was the thick, tall, yellow corn meal buttery crust.  This was definitely a deep dish PIE.  Regina served us our first slices and I grabbed my knife and fork and dug in.  A few things about this one......... The sauce was great!  Not overly tart or sweet.  A very good balance to the sauce.  The meats were piled on.  Honestly, it was too much.  Next time I come, I am going to go with a single meat pizza (maybe some onions or green peppers, too).  All of the meats were good, but it was a bit over the top.  Salty and greasy and meaty.  I also noticed that they don't use a ton of cheese here (compared to other deep dish pizza places).  It was very good, but it got overpowered by all the meats.  My favorite thing about the pizza?  That crust!  It was freaking delicious!  It held up well, had a nice bite to it, and a great flavor.  Of the major 3 in Phoenix, I think I liked Gino's crust the best.  The crust is so thick and rich and buttery and flaky.  It was great!  I saved the outer crust for my last few bites after each slice.  It sure was good.  I ate 2 slices, and was tapped out.  This pizza is FILLING!  Regina bought out our Large Meaty Legend (she cut it in half so we could each have our own box) as well as boxes for our remaining slices left over from the medium.  She asked us if we wanted to sign up for their loyalty club (do it....you get $5.00 off your order right then and there on the spot!), asked us if we wanted a water or Coke to go (again, incredibly nice gesture and most places don't ask you that), and we settled up our bill.  She was friendly as can be and provided great service with a smile!    Overall, I really enjoyed my initial visit here.  The pizza was very good (like I said before, next time I come, I am ordering a more simple pie....the overload of meats was a bit much), and I will definitely be back!  I also have 5 slices remaining for lunches for this week.  Regina and Gino's, thank you for everything.  Hope to see you guys again, soon!"}
{"text":"YES!!! Finally... Gino's East has arrived. I had lunch there on Friday, and a Birthday dinner for my Cousin last night! OUTSTANDING is my review. Oh how I have missed those fantastic deep dish pizza's. Last night we started with Fried Calamari and the Hummus appetizer, and they were GREAT. My favorite deep dish is the Sausage and Peperoni, which lived up to my expectations on Friday and last night! Friends had the Cheese/black olives, which they raved about. Welcome to Phoenix, What took so long. General Manager Sally, and server Kelsey made it a very memorable evening. Thank you all.."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the staff is friendly. I Iove the decor and being able to leave my mark on the wall.   Every single item I've tried on the menu was absolutely amazing. From the wings, mozzarella sticks and the calamari to the pizza!! The deep dish is nothing like I've ever had before !  It's complete perfection!! I'm also a huge fan of the Tie Dye thin crust pizza!!   I can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Food : .5 They don't even get a full point here because the pizza quality is less than little Cesar's. Second the portions are slim pickings with anything other than the $30 pizza option. With three pieces of meat on it. Yikes. :(  Staff: 5 Seriously some of the friendliest waiters there are in the business. Seriously Dustin and Rickey Bobby are keepers they know how to sell their product and do it well! They could run a business.  Managers: -5 I cant even begin to tell you how bad the management staff is in this place they can't find one person with any sort of customer service skills. (This guy had to of been in his 20s) The guy today was super arrogant and basically made me feel like he should be running a gym. Why would you make customers never want to come back?!? I hope the owners know they are chasing business out the door. I mean seriously this guy should be a busser with his attitude.   Total: Dont waste your money with them. Go to Nook down the street you will thank me later an take home some bomb pizza for leftovers. :)"}
{"text":"Gino's left me a bit perplexed.  I don't leave many three-star reviews... perhaps because I just make up my mind on whether I love a place, really like it, or don't like it at all.  But Gino's was just somewhere in the middle.  The wait-in-line-outside system for getting a table was not a great idea (although our group was assured that they are finalizing an app or buzzer or some other type of system to streamline and ease up that process).    The wait actually wasn't so bad, as it was a cooler breezy evening, so the hour or so standing outside was fairly comfortable.  Then we got seated.  They had a nice big booth for our group of six that fit us perfectly.  As I looked around at all of the TVs with the Cubs game, Bulls game, and Sox game on, I felt like I was back in my hometown of Chicago!  The nostalgia got to me and I felt an inner peace.  I hope that is what it feels like right before you die.  Anyway, I digress.  We ordered our pizza right away because deep-dish pizzas take 45 minutes or so to cook.  No surprise there.  Good company, good TV, and (hopefully) some good appetizers to snack on while we waited for our pizza!  The appetizers consisted of mozzarella cheese sticks and calamari.  Those are typically the reliable ones that are always going to be good at a Chicago pizza joint.  They exceeded my expectations!  Then the pizza came.  Let's face it, the pizza must be the star of the show.  It's a Chicago-style, deep-dish pizza restaurant... so nothing else matters.  And if there is one thing in life that I know, IT IS PIZZA!  Now, it has been a couple of years since I have been to Gino's... but I remember the taste, structure, ingredients and aroma of pizza like I remember my name.  This was... different.  The crust was not as crunchy and was too thick... and the sauce not as tangy.  We originally ordered our pizza with extra sauce and then the server talked us out that saying that it comes with \"A LOT\" of sauce on it already.  We still asked for the extra sauce on the side.    Our pizza did not have \"A LOT\" of sauce on it.  And that side of sauce did not arrive until we were all done with our first piece of pizza.    When that sauce did finally arrive, I became the gluttonous superhero known (probably only to me) as PizzaMan!  Yep, I went to town on a second piece.  Appetizers, a pint of beer, and two pieces of deep dish pizza.  I was turning back into that fat little kid from Chi-town... and I was ok with that!  I wish our pizza had looked and tasted like the Gino's East pizza that I know and love... but I will probably go back and give them a second chance, especially since I now live pretty much around the corner from them.  Maybe later, I will be able to update my review, but for now, it's a three.  ***THREE STARS***"}
{"text":"I went for the grand opening on Monday, knowing full well I would be waiting. Going in with that mindset, I didn't mind waiting to be sat at all. Once we got inside, I was immediately greeted by friendly faces across the restaurant, both staff and patrons. Definitely a good sign, I thought.   Our server, Dustin, went above and beyond. Immediately letting us know the deep dish pizza would take 45 minutes to an hour to prepare. He also offered suggestions for an appetizer when asked, as opposed to most servers just assuming we want to hear their favorite thing. Our drinks were never empty, he was just very personable, and one of the best servers I've ever had, if I'm being completely honest.   We had wings as an appetizer. The sauce was perfect, the wings crunchy, it was a great indicator of things to come.   Now let's talk about the pie. Deep dish, with incredible flavor in the sauce, the cheese was gooey and perfectly melted. The meats were delicious, all around one of the best pizzas I've ever had.   I can't say enough good things about the staff, food, and atmosphere at Gino's. Highly recommend it. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza!  Since I love pizza my boyfriend wanted to surprise me since he had been to the one in Chicago and loved it. When the pizza came out we are very disappointed because all I could taste is the burnt crest and there is very little sauce on the pizza. We sent the pizza back and they made us a new one.  The second pizza came out still slightly burnt on the crust, the vegetables were not cooked Amber cold and there is very little sauce. This pizza is just plain horrible and has no flavor.  The crust is like chewing on cardboard. The restaurant itself is very nice and clean and that that is the only good thing I have to say about this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I didn't get the pizza....I know! I just didn't have the 45 minutes to wait. We got a recommendation from the bartender to get the spinach mozz sticks....these were....not good. Yikes. He made it sound like fried spinach artichoke dip....that it was not. The spinach made the texture weird and took away the yummy cheese stick flavor. I also ordered their minestrone soup...now that was good! I would eat that again and the cup was really big for the price.    PS they no longer have a specialty cocktail list but they can make some of the items that used to be on there."}
{"text":"On my last visit to Chicago, I went to the original Gino's East and it was delicious. This Gino's East doesn't even begin to compare. The service was awful. It took ten minutes to get our drinks and the place was empty. The waitress stopped to talk to her coworkers in the middle of serving our pizza. When I finally dug in, I found out our order was wrong. Well we didn't want to wait longer so we ate the pizza we were given. Our waitress did fess up to the mistake and gave us a discount but her overall service was still awful. I won't be visiting again because there are better options for deep dish pizza in town."}
{"text":"Ok here we go our experience at Genos was ok for sure. We had buffalo chick macaroni and cheese it's pretty yum lots o cheese. We had a meat thin crust pizza liked it no complaints. We had Nachos recommend taking them off the menu not good at all. They must have run out of cheese for nachos???? We let them have those back and Haley removed them from the bill and we appreciate that. The manager  was quite nice and seemed interested to know people's thought of the food. It is fairly loud inside but the patio is subdued. Prices are a little high for what you get but it's not a bank breaker. Overall the food is tasty related to high fat content the pizza is not the best I have had but certainly not bad, (confessional not a Chi pizza fan). The place has great customer service many many staff. Our waitress was pleasant and happy and wanted the same for us.  We are happy with their move to our hood and think that the place attracts business and revenue all good for the area. Crowd is controlled parking is ok, bathrooms clean. Let's go to Genos!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy when they opened tis restaurant here. We moved here from Chicago in 2004 and i really missed it. Their deep dish with the sausage patty is the best pizza i have ever had. It takes 45 minutes to bake but is well worth the wait. They even sell them frozen so you can bake them at home."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the pizza but I was really dissapointed. The food was ok and nothing there that I couldn't get somewhere else better. The deep dish pizza was better then the thin crust. The thin crust pizza wasn't thin crust at all. The salad and dessert was fine. The food was pricey. The great part about the place was the waitress. She was amazing!!!! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Your search for the BEST Chicago style pizza is over! It's Gino's East! I have a weakness for deep dish pizza and I have searched everywhere in the valley to satisfy my craving. I found THE place! Not only is the pizza to die for, the drinks are amazing and the service is friendly and impeccable This is one hot spot I will be coming back to as often as possible! When I found out Gino's East came to Phx, I brought my good friend (born and raised in Chicago) to try it. He LOVED it and raved that after one bite he felt like he was back home in Chicago! Try it...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had! I would recommend them to anyone and will definitely be ordering from them again! I would also recommend the Chi-Talian Stallion pizza!"}
{"text":"I had a the pleasure of having some bring me one of their All-In Chopped Salads. Obviously because it's the New Year still, so I am trying to still watch what I eat. I always try to stay away from dressing and I was happy to find that this salad does not even need it! It's so well chopped that it's almost like eating a slaw. It had Romaine, some other greens, chicken, cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, peppers, onions, olives, blue cheese and BACON! I legit could eat this every day! Their pizza looks delicious but I will have to try it on a cheat day because it looks so filling!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I always get the deep dish pizza and have never had a bad experience with the food. The staff is always very friendly. Although, today I was a little disappointed because our waitress started off great, but then never came back to check on us after our food was dropped off and my drink was never refilled. The food still tasted great, so I will be back again."}
{"text":"Gino's East crashed the pizza block party and filled the bounce house with mozzarella!  After getting some info from Mike D. on Gino's, I was expecting to stand in a long line while baking in the unforgiving Arizona sun, no one would ever know my name, and eventually crawling to a table where I'd wait even longer for some food.  While there was very much a wait time, I was pleasantly surprised that the hostesses now have implemented a tablet system and the NoWait app to help people get seated.  After giving them my name, phone number, and party size, we were off to the patio under misters enjoying a cold beer while listening to some live tunes.  It was such a nice spring evening and it didn't seem like too long until we got seated at our table [I lied, it was like an hour wait].  We had already browsed the menu so we ordered everything right away.  The five of us had ordered Deep Dish Nachos, Jumbo Chicken [Buffalo] Wings, and the Spinach Artichoke Dip.  I also ended up sharing a small Gino's Supreme with Italian sausage.  Here's a breakdown of all the food:  - Deep Dish Nachos [Tortilla chips, refried beans, cheddar cheese, black olives, jalapeños, and salsa.  $10]:  These aren't bad.  They're your typical classic nachos that are oozing with melty cheese once it hits the table.  It's nothing special but I enjoyed them.  - Jumbo Chicken Wings  [Eight juicy jumbo wings, celery, ranch or blue cheese dressing.  $10]:  I like them!  I would prefer the skin to be fried crispier but that's just my preference.  We got these in buffalo and the spice on them was mouth watering.  They were big and meaty and perfect with blue cheese.  I'd get these again.  - Spinach Artichoke Dip  [Creamy spinach artichoke dip, toasted crostini.  $9]:  The favorite of the appetizers!  Kazi had asked our waitress what she liked and she had suggested this dip.  Excellent recommendation!  The buttery crostini was toasted perfectly and you can taste the Parmesan in the dip.  I would definitely get this again!  - Gino's Supreme  [Pepperoni or Italian sausage, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms.  Small @ $19]:  Our waitress had told us that the pizzas would take about a 45-50 minute.  As I said, I had got this with Italian sausage and I was happy with my pizza.  The sausage was pressed out into a single patty so meat is guaranteed in every bite!  Since they served it in a piping hot pan, the crust had time to become the most perfect buttery pan crust you could ask for and it's made with cornmeal!  While the crust still is not as flavorful as the Chicago deep dish joint a few miles away, it was solid!  It also had a good amount of cheese that led to so much cheese drag action.  I also love the flavor of the sausage even more so than at said other place.  The thing I didn't care for was the overly sweet sauce.  The sauce was fresh and bright but much too sweet for my preference.  I'm happy with Gino's East.  Gino's is easily my second favorite place for deep dish.  The space is new and clean, having been open for two weeks now, and the staff is friendly.  Valet is complimentary here so make sure you bring a few bucks to tip the valet guys!"}
{"text":"Although the BBQ wings were tasty and a nice sized appetizer, they gave us less than were advertised. Not to mention, they took 50+ minutes to come out! Although our waiter was open to remedying the situation by giving us a fresh order of wings, waiting over 1 hour for our deep dish pizza was quite annoying considering they weren't very busy. They seamed to have a lot of staff on the floor, but perhaps there was only one chef...To be honest, the \"Meaty Legend\" deep dish was not so legendary. Merely quite mediocre. If you're thinking about just getting take out to avoid the wait, you'll have to wait until they start their carry out service in June."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and Gino's East was my favorite restaurant growing up as a little boy in Chi-town.  Very happy to see that Gino's East is now in AZ.  I love the patty style sausage... excellent pizza.  Kelsey was our waitress today... great personality and service!! :)"}
{"text":"Finally some decent pizza in da hood! Great stuff, atmosphere & help... where have ya been?! Dough bird what?!?"}
{"text":"Let's get to the point. Ordered: Legendary Meaty deep dish There was dirty dishes hiding under the clean appetizer plates at our supposedly clean table, the pizza was horrific (It had a watery taste which made the crust soggy, it was not a deep dish pizza it looked like a thin crush, the smell was awful), that pizza was not worth 22$ for a small it should of been free due to the lack of having knowledge of preparing a traditional deep dish and the after taste of the sauce is horrible. Such a disgrace to pizza lovers. If I may, I recommend Lou Malnati's located Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"So, round two tonight to try the thin crust. Strike one - Still only valet parking, which based upon the size of the parking lot is ridiculous. The walk from the door to the valet station was longer than the walk would have been from the door to my car. Plus free valet is never really free - the guys work for tips after all.  Strike two - the \"thin crust pizza wasn't really thin it was more like a normal domino's type crust. The sausage and other toppings were good but they didn't make up for the crust.  Strike three - service was still really lacking - water glasses never refilled, servers asking if items were mine that were not, etc. It really bothers me to think that someone else's food is being paraded around from table to table looking for a home. The place just isn't that big, maybe 25-30 tables.   The only positive of the night was the minestrone soup which was actually quite good. But that and good sausage topping isn't enough to make me go a 3rd time."}
{"text":"We arrived off the plane from Dallas from an early flight back home around lunch time thinking what to eat for lunch. As we walked through terminal four we saw a small billboard sign for Gino's East Pizza.  Straight from the airport to Gino's and we ordered, from our exceptional waitress Regina, a large Meaty Legend Deep Dish Pizza. 45 minutes later, time taken to cook deep dish pizza, we were served our first slice.  We ate at the Gino's East Pizza Restaurant in Chicago off of Michigan Avenue a few years ago and was not a real fan after that experience, so when Gino's East opened in the Arcadia area I was not real excited about the opening.  I have to say this experience at the Arcadia location was impressive, the pizza was very good, hot out of the oven, the meats were excellent, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Canadian Bacon and Bacon along with the Pizza Crust was awesome.  Have to give props to our awesome waitress Regina, she was probably one of the best waitress that I have ever had. She asked us if we were a member of Gino's East Club and we said no, so she encouraged us to join and noted that we would receive instantly $5 off our pizza. We were intending on ordering a small size pizza but with the discount we decided to upsize to a large size. Regina explained all the options very thoroughly and specifically told us the deep dish pizza would take about 45 minutes to cook so she recommended some appetizers to keep our time in the meanwhile and also gave us sharpies to write on the wall. After taking care of us and wrapping up our leftovers, she writes the date on the box and includes a smile also which we would have done later.  Previously I was not a big fan of Gino's East but after this visit I am now. I would give this review of 4 Stars, but Regina our waitress moved it to a definite 5 Stars.  This location has set a high standard!"}
{"text":"The food here is only decent- I truly wasn't crazy about it. The staff was very friendly though, especially the hosts so I was pleased with the customer service. Just make sure to park in the Gino's parking lot (valet) and NOT next door by the watch, shoe and Popsicle place or they will ask you to move your car."}
