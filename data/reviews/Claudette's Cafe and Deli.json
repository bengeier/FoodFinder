{"text":"We used to go there all the time because of the quick friendly service and my husband loves their omlettes but the last couple times we've been there the floors and bathrooms have been so filthy, even a great omelette can't bring us back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"The terracotta walls, the fake hearth painted on the wall, the outdated giant wooden fork and spoons, the tired wall art, the smell in the hallway to the bathroom and the very sticky floor in great need of a proper washing all add up to reasons I would have left right away when I walked into here yesterday, 5/9/14.  I went for two reasons, 1) I had a gift cert. from a rewards program to use and 2) It was close by to where my mom had just had hand surgery and we both had to eat.  The two of us spent over $20 for just 2 beverages (mine had to be replaced due to a bug floating in it!) and 2 meals.  The portions were decent, and the chicken parm sandwich was really good, but I don't think 3/4 texas toast is a good vehicle for it, a sub bun or a Italian roll would be better.  Mom had the eggs benny and said they were good.   Really needs a good update and cleaning before I'll go back any time soon."}
{"text":"You can overlook the outdated decor because of the restaurant's friendly staff, decent food and inexpensive prices. Try the pecan cream cheese French toast. Delicious."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Have been coming here for years but the service of late has been terrible...the young man is just short of rude. Food is usual breakfast fare nothing special. Agree with comments on coffee. Sorry to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Why do people like this place?   I can only assume its of the owner. He can barely walk and probably lived a tough, hard life.  There's no busser and they could use a 2nd cook.   An hour later, when you've eaten and come to square up...more waiting.  I had to wait on him to try to dial somebody on his phone for five minutes before paying. I paid with a credit card but his machine couldn't print the receipt. He puts his hand over the phone and asks how much I'd like to tip (???)"}
{"text":"Well...had the blueberry hotcakes $2.95 & the everything but the kitchen sink omelette...husband loved his omelette...nothing to really write home about."}
{"text":"Big and clean place, slow service. Food? Don't know have not seen it yet! Ok food just ok, coffee suck!nothing special. Won't be back. Cashing out is horrible!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried when I stepped in the front door of this place.  No food in the deli case, spartan decorations for the huge space.  But this place serves up a straightforward and cheap breakfast.  I loved that I ordered everything a la carte...one egg, bacon, and English muffin.  I think that added up to $3.50ish.  Service was fast.  And their home fries are killer good.  Unassuming little place with good eats."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero star if I could   I eat takeout every day for breakfast and lunch in different restaurants in the area both by myself and with friends and I thought I would give this place a shot for lunch. They have no takeout menu and the weirdest...almost downright rude/unfriendly interaction I have ever had from the man sitting at the front. He didn't even want me walk to the shelf where the menus were to look at food choices.  I happily got a sandwich from Subway down the street as I'd rather give my money to a business that actually wants it.   Never going back here again."}
{"text":"This is a bare bones local diner.  Clean and lots of older folks who seemed to be Saturday regulars for breakfast.  The place is clean, the coffee is weak and the service is basic.  When they poured my coffee I commented to the server that it looked really weak to which she said, \"Yeah, we make it weak here.\"  Strike one.  I had  the Huevo Ranchero Burrito  -- huge and nice presentation but honestly it had no real flavor and was a huge bowl of nothing much smoothered in salsa.  It looked like it would be tasty but was a huge disappointment.  So if a lot of food is the goal this is your place.  If you want something that will make your taste buds sing then keep on driving.  Maybe the pancakes or something else would have been a better choice??  But since the server said the huevo ranchero was their best breakfast item I'll let you make your own decision.  I'll go elsewhere next time I'm hangering for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast food!!!  I went here earlier this morning with my dad and sister.  I have been here once before when the restaurant had occupied a smaller space in the plaza.  It has a slightly cozy feel to it with plenty of yummy breakfast.  I had one of their specials- gyro and cheddar omelet special with the seasoned potatoes.  I skipped the cheddar and added veggies.  The omelet had the right amount of eggs and filling it in.  It was warm, savory, and well seasoned.  The gyro meat was a perfect substitute for the bacon/sausage/ham that normally goes into an omelet.  I was a little disappointed with the seasoned potatoes because they were a little under salted.  However, I prefer the potatoes under salted than over salted.  THE TOAST is soo good, perfectly buttered and crispy on the outer edges and soft and warm on the inner piece.  The bread they use for toast is delicious.  My sister had their corned beef hash, which was really good using slices of cut up corned beef, mixed with onions, peppers, mushrooms, and seasoned potatoes.  However, I wasn't amazed with their corned beef sandwich.  It was good corned beef, but not the best.  I still love Slyman's corned beef!  The service was a little slow, but the place was packed so it's understandable.  It was well worth the wait though for that omelet.  It's a comfortable place to get some amazing, cheap breakfast food when you are looking for omelets and hash.    I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Claudette's never fails to deliver the best breakfast around. Whether it's eggs and toast, French toast or corned beef hash, we have never been disappointed. We've never been for lunch or beyond but highly recommend you stop by for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I don't care for the greasy food.  The hash browns and omelettes are so greasy that lots of greasy residue remains on the plate if you can manage to get the food down.  Their burger and fries is a decent choice but nothing special. The wait staff is always nice and efficient, even when it's clear they are understaffed at times.  I stop here on a somewhat regular basis for coffee with friends and the wait staff turnover seems high."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Claudette's in a while.  The prices have increased, the syrup was actually foamy (watered down?), and they charged $1 to get an extra plate for a tall stack of pancakes.  On the upside:  it's brightly lit and the waitress was very efficient.  We used to like to support this facility as it is a \"local business\" but it has lost much of its quaintness/appeal with the move to the larger location in the same plaza.  It's not a bad value for the money but the quality is average at best."}
{"text":"new managment . new owner come and check us out  been doing a lot of cleaning .adding banana split waffles"}
{"text":"We really wanted to try and give this place a chance, because it was the waitress' first day.  Unfortunately, not much went right.  My daughter ordered chocolate chip pancakes...no chocolate chips.  Crispy bacon? Not so crispy.  I had to ask three times for coffee creamer.  Then I had to ask for the toast that went with my omelette.  My wife ordered a grilled chicken salad and the chicken was suspect at best.  We had to get up and ask for our bill, and then the gentleman (I'm assuming the owner?) at the cash register rang up the wrong amount on our credit card.  When my wife asked to sign the credit card receipt, he was hesitant and said he trusted her...sorry...we did not trust him.  Bad experience overall.    As for the food  it was mostly ok...not great.   Service, it was poor, but her first day.   Atmosphere, pretty dated and a little dirty  Price...not great, but not terrible unless you're talking value  Overall, well, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Love Claudette's!!! Sophie is the best server there! She's is very attentive, always offering refills on coffee etc and very friendly!!  Best breakfast spot in the area! Way better than your typical breakfast chains!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We enjoyed breakfast but Claudettes is a definite greasy spoon. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Been here at least 20 times. nothing special average cleanliness average food easy to get in and out of if that's your issue."}
{"text":"Food was very blah and super outdated decor. Not impressed. I have been to better places in the area."}
{"text":"Place was gross. Place used to always sell spoiled outdated food. Food would always have a weird smell and taste funny. Service was always slow and all the employees would do is fight abd argue. I used to work at this place. Was so underpaid and the owner didn't care about nothing but the money. The snacks he always sold up front was never homemade all was generic over priced garbage. Hopefully the new owner can do things right."}
{"text":"Slightly below average breakfast grub. The sausage was brown-and-serve (pre-cooked) thrown on the grill, the French toast was slightly soggy, and the potatoes weren't cooked very well. Pricey, for a sub-par breakfast, dated decor, and below average customer service, so I won't return."}
{"text":"Had amazing pecan French toast for breakfast!  Great service and very reasonable...will definitely be back!  Thank you"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place. The guy at the register has been there for a hundred years and still doesn't know anything. I asked for an extra dressing and the old lady just rolled her eyes. I ordered 2 kids chicken fingers and they got that order wrong. Terrible, terrible customer service. The people obviously don't want to be there. Maybe it's time to retire!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwich and great coffee.  The owners roast their own coffee, and it is genuinely amazing.    Kind family and solid belly filling food.  Only thing that probably hurts them is their location - not the greatest.  I have seen a lot of businesses go in and out of this plaza over the years.  Hopefully they can hang on!"}
{"text":"Looking for a GREASY spoon, here's the spot! Good food! Hence the 4 stars!   2 servers for a big busy place, not a great idea!   Friendly enough server! She was slammed due to lack of help!   I'd go back!  DECOR IS AWFUL though!"}
{"text":"A spacious diner that was bustling in the Sunday morning I stopped by. The food is standard fare: nothing unexpected in my veggie omelet with hash browns and toast. The coffee, unfortunately, left much to be desired, as it was weak, akin to the free coffee I find in hospitals. Still, the service was outstanding, and three of the staff said more than a sentence to me: three!! So, while the coffee couldn't do it for me, the people made me feel warm inside."}
{"text":"Really good food and pleasant fast service.    Even though I wasn't very hungry when I my parents and I went to breakfast here I still managed to eat my entire spinach and feta omelette, hashbrowns, a few bites of toast along with a sampling of Mom's Greek omelette and Dad's blueberry pancakes.  A friendly face and charming personality \"Wes\" greeted us at the door when we walked in.  Although it said seat yourself, he lead us to a table handing out menus as he let us know someone would be right with us.  Always a good sign when you get the last table in the house - not too packed that you have to wait 30 min for a table but busy enough that you know the place is solid.  My parents and I have hit a ton of breakfast places over the years.  This one is definitely worth a repeat visit.   Notes:  The interior is plain so if you're looking for ambiance this isn't the place. Also, it's not what I'd call expensive but our bill for three (3 meals + 3 cups coffee) was $27.98."}
