{"text":"Great place to belly up to the bar and enjoy a cold drink. Good happy hour and seems to be some great daily food specials too. Service is great and Lucy will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"So this place is attached to a hotel, but don't let that fool you. This place is an absolute blast. Cheap drinks, good food and friendly atmosphere. If Misty is working, belly up to the bar and get ready for a good time. She's super sweet and very attentive. This place has a nice eclectic mix of people and is not a \"hipster\" place, which is nice when you're not looking for vegan/gluten free bar stools."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon. The server was great. Food was very good. I will say that the kitchen is slow and apparently were having staff issues.  The down side was that it needs a lot of work.  Cleaning, remodeling. As soon as you open the door, it smells musty."}

{"text":"The KB is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The mrs had the Stromboli and it too was phenomenal. 
Service and atmosphere are top notch   Highly recommend!  

Ps.  Portion are quite large.  I'm a big eater and only finished half my meal"}
{"text":"There was an event going on the night I was there and I'd like to think I'm a patient person, but only so patient... The service was pretty terrible and we waited over an hour for pretty low quality bar food. Our waitress was very sweet, clearly aware that we weren't happy with the wait, but stretched extremely thin. Even getting our checks took forever. Another couple that got there after us left after waiting for food 45 minutes or so. The restaurant wasn't very clean either. Just not a great time at all."}
{"text":"Lucy is absolutely AMAZING. I come here because she is the best bartender I have ever met. From her broad knowledge of beer to perfectly poured mixed drinks. The bar itself is a little gem, but she makes it sparkle."}
{"text":"This place, well what can I say. The owners sit at one end of the bar and talk about how great there lives are, and how much they travel, while the bartender keeps pouring them free drink after free drink. And not just for them, but for their friends as well. The food is good today, but tomorrow not so much. If you are looking for a silver lining, the specials are good."}
{"text":"Love this place wish it was in the city! owners are always willing to make you happy and you cant beat the prices. best wings in pittsburgh"}
