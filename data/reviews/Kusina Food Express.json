{"text":"I used to love their palabok until  they stopped serving it hot. Now they serve it half of the container that you see and the picture and its cold . And i mean cold coming straight from the fridge :("}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the Hurontario-Dundas intersection. If you haven't tried Filipino dishes and is in a rush to get something you would never regret , try their Crispy Pata (Deep fried pork knuckles). You would be lucky to get a seat from their 6 seater counter coz it's always occupied especially Lunch hour. They have a great selection of everyday dishes and always sell out fast . Call ahead and you can pick up your order .

Must try :
Crispy Pata ( Deep fried pork knuckles)
Lechon Kawali ( Crispy pork belly)
Pakbet ( Assorted veggies in shrimp paste)
Chicken and Pork Empanada
Leche flan"}
{"text":"Most Filipino eateries consist of hot food counters where people point at what they want and take it to go. It's called \"turo-turo\" or point-point. It's not common to have a sit down Filipino restaurant with table service. Kusina doesn't deviate from this formula. It works. People come, point and take some mighty delicious and comforting food home.

My faves are Kare-Kare (oxtail in peanut sauce), Crispy Pata (deep fried ham hock) and Palabok (rice noodles in shrimp and pork sauce). I'd call ahead and ask what they have available. And if it's not already cooked, they will usually make it for you.

Friendly, to-the-point, stick to your ribs comfort Filipino food... Kusina is a very good place."}
