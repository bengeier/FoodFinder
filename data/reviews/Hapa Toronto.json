{"text":"You know what? I'm going to lose a lot of friends for this. But all of them say this place is good. .... Well in my years of Japanese izakaya it's honestly not traditional enough and too much fusion. Servers are slow and just not authentic enough compared to all other izakayas I've been to. Good grade is not in point at all! The taste and style is just not authentic izakaya at all. Tastes too fusion and even the most popular that I thought (Guu) is not that authentic and that is even more authentic then this. Chefs are Japanese and mixed, kinda explains it all. Servers don't pronounce the welcomes properly and just no efforts. I say it's more like a all you can eat Chinese owned grade restaurant for food and servers from Jack Astors. Bottom line meh! ..... The service is Soo slow I'm bored to death!!!!!!"}
{"text":"went there on a Sat night.  Tried the Kobe beef, Halibut Tacos,  Tuna Avocado Salad with Plantain Chips Kobe beef was so good, the other 2 item was not bad either."}
{"text":"When you step in a restaurant and you know you are going to hate the experience but you've got a groupon... That is what happened here.   First of all, the nightclub loud music made it impossible to enjoy ourselves. The server did not seem to enjoy her work at all.   The food was ok at best.  And the last straw was the ladies room where the stalls were so small that the doors were unable to open completely. I had to climb on the toilet in order to get it. Awful experience!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 4 during the long weekend but found the place to be pretty empty. We mostly had non-fish dishes because my sister doesn't like the taste of fish. I have been to Hapa in Vancouver and I remember the fish dishes being decent. I'll have to come back and try more fish dishes...  TUNA AVOCADO SALSA DIP (Chopped Ahi tuna, avocado, tomato, plantain chips) - The salsa to chip ratio is a bit lacking as we had several chips left over. The dip itself is quite tasty. BEEF TATAKI (Lightly seared AAA beef, sesame-chili sauce) - This dish has a bit of a kick which is refreshing but we wished there was more beef on this plate. EBI MAYO (Tempura prawns, spicy mayo sauce) - I had this in Vancouver and got it again in Toronto. One of my favourite Hapa dishes! Highly recommend. KARAAGE (Deep-fried boneless chicken, soy ginger sauce) - Interestingly, this dish was the hit of the evening. Not too much batter or oiliness. Highly recommend. IKA (Grilled squid, sake soy garlic marinade) - We found this to be a little overcooked which made it more chewy. We would not get this again. SPICY PORK ISHI-YAKI (Rice, minced pork, garlic sprouts, egg, tomato, lettuce, spicy miso; served in a hot stone bowl) - Pretty good dish as a filler. The waiter told us to let it sit for a couple minutes so that it would be crispier.  MENTAIKO KIMCHI UDON (Creamy Mentaiko with Udon noodles and kimchi) - This was an average udon dish. Nothing special to write home about. CRAB TEMPURA ROLL (Snow crab, cucumber, sweet chili sauce) - We were extremely disappointed when this roll came out with only 5 pieces (making it over $2 a piece - yikes)! Would rather go for a fish roll next time."}
{"text":"Drink list seems ok. Service was good. Good music, but louder than just a regular restaurant. The sushi wasn't very good. I wouldn't recommend ordering it. Appetizers were good. Sashimi was good. There are better places in the city than this."}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese tapas. The servers were very nice and friendly. I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of six. It was a fun experience. Great ambiance, food and service.   We ordered pretty much everything on the hot sharing plates and every single dish was delicious. I had a Harajuku Girl drink and it was amazing.   We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Hapa Izakaya! The meal was delicious and of good proportion. The girl who was serving us was super friendly too. The atmosphere reminded me of a fancy lounge and I love that they added candles on the table! I enjoyed my seasonal greens appetizer and pork belly lettuce wrap! Thank you Hapa izakaya!"}
{"text":"This is a great izakaya. The food is the typical, delicious fare. The service is almost OTT friendly...just fantastic. Plus, they take reservations."}
{"text":"Returned for the awesome UYE organized by Edwin A. (thanks!) and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. I can't believe we had the opportunity to try 12 dishes for only $29, and the serving sizes were quite decent.  I started with the \"Hello Kitty\" and yes, it was as delicious and cheerfully sweet as it sounds! (strawberry puree, Calpico and Absolut) Others around me enjoyed the Asahi Black, which Mel L. informed us is not readily available at most establishments.  We gobbled up: 1. Edamame - I really liked this simple dish, and could have eaten a lot more of it. Very tasty. Recommend. 2. Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip - This was one of my favourite dishes. It was very light and refreshing, with great flavours. Came with great plantain chips. I wanted more! Recommend. 3. Beef Tataki - This also went down very easily, smoothly and quickly. The sesame-chili sauce was also sweet. Recommend. 4. Tuna Carpaccio - It was pretty smooth as well, but wasn't a stand-out dish for me. 5. Negitoro - The tuna belly was rich, but the garlic bread pairing was a bit off. Too much bread, would have liked this on something a bit thinner and drier. 6. Ebi Mayo - Another stand-out dish! (How many favourites can I have in one meal?? You will notice the dishes getting progressively heavier here. This is also when I started to slow down as my appetite could not keep up). Recommend. 7. Renkon Gyoza Tempura - Instead of regular dumpling wrappings, these were enrobed in thin lotus root and deep-fried. It was so-so for me. 8. Halibut Taco - This one had a surprising kick with the jalapeno tartar sauce. My SO liked this one very much, but I was less enthused. I was saving room for something that would wow me more. Luckily... 9. Beef Short Ribs - These were delicious and finger-licking good. Very thin, easy to eat, and had a nice smoky soy marinade. Beef quality was nice too, not too fatty nor too dry. Sooo good. Recommend. 10. Karaage - Least favourite dish of the night, it was a bit dry and not too flavourful. Pass! 11. Spicy Pork Ishi-Yaki - It had nice flavour, but I would consider this more of a \"filler\" dish (as in get this one to fill you, instead of two non-rice/noodle dishes). 12. Yaki Udon - I liked this dish with its slippery noodles, but really, at 12 dishes, I was pretty much done at this point. SO didn't find the noodles \"chewy\" enough, but I liked them fine. Recommend.   Other factors: Atmosphere: loud, dark, MLB on TV screens is a little different for an izakaya Service: consistent and friendly  Overall with food, drink and gratuity, the evening came to just shy of $50. Amazing deal!"}
{"text":"I must say this place is great. Their staff are friendly and can definitely help you out with what you want to order.  Me and my partner ordered a handful of dishes and all of it was greatly presented and most of all they were all delicious. I really liked the Spicy Baja Roll, very flavorful, but not overwhelming. Their Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip was also great, very fresh and the plantains are a great touch, rather then giving you normal nachos.  I'd have to say compared to the other competitors that are around, Hapa has become my new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place really exceeded my expectations.  I was blown away when I first visited Guu, but this place might have surpassed that experience.  All the main/app dishes we ordered were delicious, but the octupus in wasabi is something I still dream about.  I really can't find one thing to fault with any of the dishes I ordered.  Also, the playful cocktails were fantastic and reasonably priced.  I had about three, and could have easily had double that.  Luckily there are virgin versions for those who are driving.  The only slight let down were the desserts.  They were ok, but not on par with the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here in hope of the same experience I had in Vancouver, but was utterly disappointed. Ambience has nothing to do with a Japanese restaurant, more like another toronto lounge with weird lighting and big TVs. We couldn't hear each other over the noise.  Food was just ok, nothing terrible but nothing too special to make me wanna go back.  Also hard to get the attention of the servers in general."}
{"text":"The set up is pretty much the same as the old Coco Lezzone with some minor changes.   The noise level is awful.  In order to have a conversation with the person sitting across from you you'll have to text them.  Not a good place for any kind of conversation unless you enjoy yelling.   And having two big tv screens with sports on was a little odd.  We tried the following: Ebi Avocado Salad - OK standard salad.  I don't think I would say they were prawns.  They were more like shrimps to me.  It had a nice refreshing dressing  And the greens were nice and fresh and crispy. Gindara - It was decent but very small.  About the size of a kit kat bar. Tuna avocado salsa dip - It was decent but you can't see any tuna in there, they really chopped it up very fine.  The plantain chips were tasty.   Renkon Gyoza Tempura - Jut a regular gyoza to me.  At least they were a little bigger than expected and were nicely stuffed so it wasn't just all just wrapping.  The dipping sauce was nothing special just tasted like soy sauce to me.   Spicy pork Ishi-Yaki (minced pork with rice in a hot stone bowl) - It was OK but was missing something. Matcha fudge - This is the same stuff I get from out of a box from the Asian grocery store Panna cotta - This was a nice dessert, I'm a sucker for panna cotta.  I wasn't sure about the maple syrup but it was good.  The dishes were all OK but nothing really special about them that I can't get elsewhere and in some cases cheaper.  The food wasn't bad but at the same time there was nothing there that would make me want to go back.  All the dishes we tried were decent but seemed to be missing something to take it up a notch.  I've been to Guu and if I was comparing I prefer Guu.  The atmosphere was more fun and the food was more memorable.  The flavours and dishes offered at Guu were more interesting than Hapa.    The staff at Hapa was great, everyone was really friendly and we have no complaints about the service."}
{"text":"Hapa has definitely lost its touch. When it first opened in Toronto, I use to enjoy the food (although it had small portions) and it  gave me reason to come back.  I just went again for a friend's bday the other night and thought most of the items were rather salty and unspectacular.  The service though is always good here."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on a Sunday night to celebrate a birthday dinner. The day of I had to call to add people to the reservation and it was no problem - great service all throughout the reservation process. When we arrived, we were offered a long table or the option of sitting in a private section in the back dining area.  Food highlights: grilled squid, karaage, yaki udon, scallop tar tar, maple glazed pork belly... it was all really tasy and the food came out very promptly. I echo the sentiment in previous reviews that the service is excellent - we spoke to one of the owners who took the time to offer suggestions based on our preferences.  At the end, they sent out their house-made almond ice cream for the birthday boy - at no cost to us, and they even checked with us before sending it out. A very thoughtful and attentive gesture, considering we made no mention on the day off, only briefly when I made the reservation.  They make everything in-house, including all their sauces and dips - it's hard to find a place that does that well and with so much pride these days. Highly recommended and I will return again."}
{"text":"OK, enough with the comparisons to Guu... Not every Japanese tapas place is like Guu. This place is loud too, but you can actually have a conversation here without yelling. I just loved the pork belly dishes, sushi, fish tacos, any of their lettuce wraps... All washed down with sake & a giant mug of Sapporo. The staff is excellent because many of them are co-owners. I've had nothing but amazing service from the moment I walked in, regardless of whether I was there with a group, for a girl's night and even on a family night with my (very well-behaved) infant daughter. It's not Guu, get over it. It's a great place if you're in the mood for yummy food & staff that's super friendly and easy on the eyes. My only small complaint is they often run out of menu items.  P.S. Try the Japanese apple pie, or crème brûlée or ice cream..."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with 2 of my girlfriends on valentines day and we sat by the bar and were served by the cute mixed looking asian guy. He was so knowledgable about everything on the menu and didn't hesitate at all when we asked him questions about the sake. The ambiance was really nice and inviting and everyone smiled and said hello. The food was so delicious and fresh. If I didn't live so far I would come here more often."}
{"text":"3.5/5! I prefer Guu- but its still good! I recommend the Beef Tataki, Ebi Mayo, Halibut Taco & Fish & Chips Roll! Great service & amazing honeydew flavoured sake!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service (attitude-wise) and well prepared food! Went here with my wife on Valentine's Day and really enjoyed our dinner.  Not the best Izakaya in T.O., but definitely worth a try. Ebi Mayo and fried chicken are both well prepared in my opinion.  Suggestions:   Waitresses need better training to serve hot sake, otherwise, just let customers do their own pouring  Pricing should be lowered, the restaurant is not quite there yet for the current price-level"}
{"text":"Friendly greetings and great service throughout the night. The food is Japanese style tapas dining.  Great space and a mixed crowd when we visited on a weekend. We just missed the happy hour, so we ordered off the main menu.  Everyone ordered two or three dishes to start with - to shared and was very happy with our selection.  Dishes averages around $9-$10 each.  Notable favorites of the night were the pork belly lettuce wrap and the duck confit poutine and the halibut taco.  The staff were all very helpful and fun. Food was good, we all enjoyed our selection, but it was nothing amazing or defining where i have to have it the next time I return.  Overall, we had a great time."}
{"text":"Having been to the Hapa Izakaya on Robson Street in Vancouver, I had very high expectations for their first foray into Toronto. After coming here about a week after their grand opening, I am so happy that Hapa decided to come to Toronto.  Atmosphere: Friendly staff and classy interior, yet not pretentious. Great date night place.   Two of us spent around $35 each including drinks. We ordered: - Aburi Saba: Seared marinated mackerel sashimi. Awesome presentation on this dish (blowtorched at your table) and the taste was excellent. Very fresh tasting - Halibut Taco: More of a wrap than a taco, but still excellent. Halibut tasted very good and the Jalapeno tartar sauce adds a kick to this - Gindara: Baked sablefish, sake-miso marinade. This was my favourite dish. The sablefish melts in your mouth and the skin was perfectly crispy. This dish instantly brought me back to memories of the amazing seafood in Vancouver.  - Polenta Fries: This didn't stand out as much as the others, but was still delicious - Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps: The pork belly was perfectly cooked and it reminded me of peking duck. I love pork belly and this dish reminded me why.  Guu comparisons will probably be made, but I don't think it's apples-to-apples. I got a very different vibe from Hapa. Guu feels more casual and playful, while Hapa feels more formal and classy. I love both Guu and Hapa and I think it's refreshing to have an izakaya place in Toronto that doesn't strive to be like Guu. This place is a must-try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with friendly, knowledgable and beautiful staff here. The menu is always done perfectly and consistent, with new menu items to blow my taste buds away and old time favorites that never fail. This is always one of my favorite places to go for large dinner parties and fun date nights."}
{"text":"The place was practically dead when we went on a weeknight around 6. The music was blasting. More of a chic bar than a Japanese izakaya. The food was a little fusion but tasted good. Some dishes worked while others didn't.  Don't go expecting regular Japanese pub fare.   Go during Hapa Hour: 5:30 - 6:30. Order from the 1/2 off menu. Awesome deal since the portions are bigger than regular tapas."}
{"text":"The izakaya food here is more fusion than traditional, but still very delicious. The prices per dish is higher than Guu's but the portion sizes are also much larger. The noise level in my opinion is pretty loud (the music is really loud), but I don't mind because Izakayas are traditionally not quiet restaurants.   This place has a club like feel resulting from the music volume and selection and also the dark low level lights. It is much less lit than Guu, but I can still see the menu. The only issue I have with the lighting is that I wish the bathrooms were also not dark as heck, and if it has to be dark, that there was not a small step from the bathroom stalls, I almost tripped and fell because it was so dark and the small step was place in an unexpected area, this is especially bad if you are a little tipsy which people has a high probability of being since it is an izakaya!   We had  the sashi mori, which is basically the chef''s daily special sashimi, we got a good selection of  sweet scallops, yellowtail, ahi tuna,salmon and albacore tuna. The seafood was fresh and high quality!  The beef tataki, spicy pork ishi yaki, and kobe beef bites which were all good. The bill was around $90 after tip, so it was definitely a bit more pricey than Guu. They do have 1/2 price tapas from 5:30-6:30pm daily for happy hours, so it is probably more affordable to eat then.  I like how this place takes reservations and they are on open table! Overall, a good experience and I will return to try more dishes (hopefully during happy hour!)"}
{"text":"This is definitely the most expensive and least authentic izakaya in Toronto.  The drinks are CHINTZY. I drink booze (i.e. not wine) very rarely, and can always taste it. My $12 Pear/Sake/Vodka martini tasted like water and elicited not even the faintest of buzz.  So I switched to wine, and doubt the glass was even 6oz.   The food was ok, at least 30% more expensive than Guu. Some dishes better than others. The fresh fish was fresh in the least.   But what really killed it was the music. It was like a nightclub. Even the wait staff dress like it is a nightclub. And when it started to get busier, they cranked it up and put 90s reggae hits on. Not surprisingly, people asked for their bills and the tables cleared out pretty fast. Interestingly, the music then re-quieted a bit as the second round of people were seated. I HATE that trick.   Anyways, it is not comfortable enough for a fun dinner with friends over drinks and it is far too expensive for a quick dinner for two.   Miss."}
{"text":"Great representation of Japanese tapas. The staff were knowledgeable about the menu and contained the authenticity of the place.   We ordered a bunch of items from the menu, for the table. The salmon sashimi, the polenta fries, and the beef short ribs were some of them. All of the food contained the right amount of flavor and spices. The saki here is a must try!  The ambience of the place lived up to a top restaurant for College Street and the area. The seating surrounding the bar and the chef's preparation area / kitchen seemed quite comfortable as well."}
{"text":"Tried three dishes using a groupon deal for half off. I am a Canadian who lived in Japan and loves Japanese food and hospitality. This Izakaya... Sigh.  A lobster tail with king oyster mushroom was pure false advertising. A half of a very small shell (more like crayfish) was used solely for presentation with no meat inside. It was stuffed with the mushrooms but almost no lobster at all whatsover. The two tiny morsels of lobster were dried up and awful and I cant even decide if it was lobster in reality. In amidst the lobster were tiny pieces of roasted pork, not mentioned on the menu. I am a pescaterian and revolted by pork but I know what it tastes like. I asked the waitress if the dish includes meat in it and she swore there was no meat in it. I then emptied the shell and found several pieces of meat and no more lobster.   The crab sushi roll was a very small serving with very little crab. The crab was flavorless and dry. The roll was presented in mayo and ketchup sauce and so it tasted like ketchup and stale burnt oil.   Ebi mayo came in the same sauce as the crab sushi roll. It was not hot, or particularly crispy.  Not decent sized shrimp by any measure, these were on the small side. The price was higher than on the website menu and the presentation on the website shows large shrimps: felt like bait and switch.  The servers repeatedly tried to get us to order drinks and more food and were cold to the point of it being rude.  I left still hungry and went home to make dinner (Japanese instant curry which was more authentic than the meal I had there sadly)  This is an Izakaya. It is supposed to be about simple, honest food and friendly comfortable service!"}
{"text":"We had no reservations so we were lucky to have seats by the kitchen bar. They had a Hello Kitty cocktail so of course I had to try it. It had strawberry  purée, Calpico, Absolut and Soda. They should put a hello kitty head on it or something to make it a hello kitty.  We tried quite a variety of items on the menu. Hapa Wings - Yuzu salt & pepper fried chicken wings, bourbon maple soy. Kakuni - Japanese braised pork belly, garlic toast. Salmon Yukke - Salmon tartar with a raw quail egg, served with tempura nori chips. Steak bites - AAA Beef, Yukon fingerling potato, onion carrot. Lobster Oshizushi - Grilled & torched lobster sashimi, miso mayo. And finally the Volcano ramen. The steak was ok, the meat was quite chewy, hard to break apart. The chicken wing was very tasty as well as the kakuni. The salmon tartar was freshly done, goes well with the nori chips.  For dessert, we got the Japple Pie Gyoza - Cinnamon apple gyoza, green tea ice cream. I like the green tea ice cream inside the cream puff that was on the side more than the gyoza. The service was quite slow but they were nice when they do come and help. The food was slow, waited quite some time for dishes to come but that's usually how it works for izakaya."}
{"text":"Hapa in Vancouver has a very good impression on me.  Now we try to visit Hapa in Toronto.    EBI MAYO has the light fried prawn sitting on a piece of bread that are fresh and with mayo tastes good. SPICY PORK ISHI-YAKI (Rice, minced pork, flower, chives, egg, tomato, lettuce, spicy miso, served in a hot stone bowl) is average. Curry Butter Chicken - It tries to mimic the Indian Butter Chicken, either the taste is not as good and the Naan is nowhere near its original.  Although the spice used is Japanese, the taste somehow still is no comparison with the Indian cuisine. The Halibut fish ball with liquid green wasabi tastes ok as the fish ball is not stiff enough and when you bite it, it melts like tofu.  There are not that many people at 7pm.  The back section is closed and is open for us.  Just a few people having drinks in the front.  If I ever have to go to Izakaya for any food again, I will definitely go to Guu which is so much better either in food or environment in Toronto (see my review on Guu).  In contrast, Hapa is better than Guu in Vancouver.  Isn't it funny"}
{"text":"For those who are worried about the tapas-sized plates, here's a $25 Summerlicious meal which leave you satisfied:  Appetizer: Spot Prawn Ceviche is beautifully presented in a stemless wineglass. The spot prawn and cucumber avocado salsa are served with wonton chips. You'll probably want to take pictures of this appetizer; it's so pretty.  Entree: The Kinoko Ishiyaki would turn many people away because it's a vegetarian dish, but don't be fooled! It's a mixture of enoki, shiitake, and king oyster mushrooms and rice, and it's served in a big hot stone bowl. Flavourful and filling.  Dessert: Matcha Crème Brûlée or Japple Pie Gyoza (deep fried gyoza filled with apples and served with ice cream) were both very nice ways to end the meal.  Atmosphere: Compared to other izakayas, this one is more sedate; however, on the bright side, you can have a conversation. And although the kitchen staff was listening to Marc Anthony, the rest of us were listening to remixed old-school R&B. A good Japanese addition to Little Italy."}
{"text":"I'm so happy my favorite izakaya made it to Toronto! I planned a bachelorette here a week after its opening and it was the best decision ever. Not only was the food a hit (halibut wraps were a hit, curry stone bowl, torched Saba, the avocado salad, black cod) actually everything we ordered for our group of 8 was amazing.  Thee staff was super attentive and great sports in supporting our bachelorette games. The energy from the place was amazing from the bartenders to the host and servers and chefs. I'd look for any excuse to come back again. Kudos to Hapa for making such a memorable night for us.   Oh the bill came out to $40 per person really all we could eat and drink. Perfect."}
{"text":"I've yet to experience the Hapas in Vancouver, so I can't really compare it to anything other than izakayas either here in North America or those in Japan, which is kind of unfair and also somewhat pointless as the idea is to review this establishment alone, for its own merits, right?  I checked out Hapa the first weekend of its opening and I liked it a lot. Considering it had just opened here, there was little in the way of any noticeable snags which can often happen when a place first opens its doors. Good to know that an already-established chain has got it together.   Upon entering, one feels like they've just entered some hip place: the music, decor, vibe, and the crowd...all positives. Service was good, though we did have one waitress who was inexperienced and a little too chatty for our hungry bellies, but there was no lack of effort there.  We ordered everything off their menu, which I can't say is the most intriguing and lacks any real originality or excitement but hopefully this will change over time as they fine-tune things along the way? Prices were about $5 and up for tapas portions. I avoided things like kimchee and edamame, and my favourite item on the menu was their black cod. The skin was perfectly crispy and the flesh fell apart with the slightest nudge of the chopsticks. The size was rather small for ~$11 but still very delicious. Their ebi mayo was also decent: eight succulent shrimp battered and fried, then smothered in a mildly sweet/spicy mayo. It's not something I would normally order but given the choices, it was one of only a few things that stood out. Oh, and their cocktails were great!  Located in Coco Lezzone's old spot in Little Italy, Hapa is definitely worth a try and I am sure they will be around for a while. They seem to offer something a little different from the rest of the izakayas around town in terms of the vibe mostly (AND they take reservations!!!), but also its location is ideal for a night out."}
{"text":"Love the food and it's very great prices. It is a very small place so if you don't make a reservation, they am not afraid to tell you that you have a table for only 45 mins and you will have to leave by a certain time. It's great though, because other restaurants will just turn you away because of the reservations.  Food was great, but some item does take a little longer than the other. So try to order everything you want once instead of some at a time and adding to the bill. Love the variety of the selection of the different bbq delights. The pork belly sandwich in the Manto bun... MUST TRY!!! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Walked in mid-summer. We were welcomed, seated, and very well feeded. The staff were very friendly and took a lot of pride in what they cooked and what they served you. I loved the vibe, and I really liked the food too. Lots of fusion Japanese/Italian, Japanese/French, etc ideas and all brought to you with a dose of good humour and awesome surroundings. I recommended the place to anyone who would listen for about 3 months afterward, which is why I figured I should write a review! :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Hapa Izakaya Cuisine: Japanese Location: Little Italy Address: 602 College St Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * Japanese izakaya style * Sharing style * Orginally from Vancouver * Bar seating Avail  Although Toronto is slowly catching up with the izakaya trend from Vancouver, there still isn't enough decent ones to go around. Sure, I like Guu because their food is good and is consistent, but sometimes I don't want to wait for a seat for an hour. Compared to how many ramen joints are popping up in just downtown Toronto, I am surprised not many izakayas are making it's way here to Toronto. Anyways, so that's why I was somewhat glad to hear that hapa izakaya was coming to Little Italy.  Most of you probably know that they originally opened their first location back in Vancouver where it created tremendous success and really made it's name. I was def one of those people on the wagon visiting their restaurant at least once a week when they first opened about 8~9 years ago. However, few years down the road many other izakayas opened near by that offered just as good food and I just kind of stopped going.  Long story short, I was excited to try the restaurant again when they first opened so I paid a visit in September not too long after they first opened. It was a sunday night and the restaurant was packed. Luckily I was only dining with one other friend so we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  I tried to remember what were some of my favorite items from their menu back in the day and ordered few to try out.  Ordered: Sashimi Salad 1/5  * Mixed sashimi with citrus soy dressing with organic greens for $15.99. This used to be one of my favorite things to order back in the day so I was excited to try it out again. However, when this arrived, I couldn't believe what I was saw! I know we are on a different coast and maybe I shouldn't compare but this salad looked so sad with 3~4 pieces of sashimi on top. Salad was just greens and the dressing wasn't anything special nor were those 4 pieces of sashimi anything spectacular. It could have been those salad that Japanese restaurants give you with a lunch set. I was so disappointed and would not order this again.  Ordered: Beef Tataki 1/5  * Lightly seared AAA beef with sesame chili sauce for $9.99. This might have been the worst beef tataki I've had in my life besides from AYCE places. Beef was dry and had paper like texture and obviously lacking in quality. If you are eating almost raw beef, you need it to be up to somewhat of a standard which this obviously wasn't it. Also, the sesame chili sauce didn't help either. It tasted just like Korean hot sauce and because the beef pieces were so tiny in size, it was drenched in the sauce and just wasn't pleasant.  Ordered: Aburi Saba 3/5  * Seared marinated mackerel Sashimi for $8.99. This was pretty decent but for some reason I found it to be overly salty and not so fresh.  Ordered: Ebi Mayo 2/5  * Tempura prawn with spicy mayo sauce for $9.49. This is a pretty hard dish to mess up, but it was prety disappointing. Ok, I know this post is getting a little depressing..but the tempura prawn was so soggy! It felt like it had been sitting there for awhile and they tried to cover it up with the spicy mayo sauce. With deep fried things, it's hard to displease me but this was just so wrong. Even the spicy mayo couldn't save this luke warm soggy prawn tempura.  * Ishiyaki 4/5  * Rice, minxed pork, garlic sprouts, egg, tomato, lettuce and spicy miso served in hot stone bowl $10.99. This used to be another favorite dish of mine and thank goodness it didn't disappoint. Think of it as warm BiBimBab and it should make sense to you. They bring it to the table and mix it for you and what I do it let it sit for a bit so that it makes crispy rice bits on the bottom. I really enjoy this dish a lot and it's good to order for that extra carb to fill you up.  Summary: Overall, I was quite disappointed with their food. Concept is still the same but I guess lack of seafood really brings down the quality of their dishes here in Toronto.  It was much more upsetting to see how the food lacks in quality and flavor because I know this is not how they do it in Vancouver. I know it's unfair to compare 2 different locations because the Toronto location obviously wouldn't have same access to ingredients like the Vancouver location.  However, even if I didn't compare 2 different locations, just the food itself didn't impress me either. Regardless, that excuse doesn't work with me and I really can't be sympathetic with food. I would much rather wait an hour for Guu or Nome Izakaya"}
{"text":"Bad experience with lukewarm food, bad presentation, and confusing atmosphere.  First Impression - I brought my partner here to celebrate her birthday and we chose our courses from the Winterlicious Prix Fixe menu. My first impression when we walked in was the staff yelling \"Irrashai!\" somewhat half heartedly, and with pretty bad accents. Second was the skimpy, Moxie-type outfits that the servers were wearing. On the plus side, they were very friendly.  The Food - We ordered our food and it came quickly, however, it was not even hot! The way it was plated lent no aid to the taste and flavour of the food, which was fairly bland and almost cold. Both of our servings of rice had a thin crust around the outside - signature of rice that has been sitting for some time. The food tasted about the same as you would find at your local asian fast food court, and the potato croquettes - which you may know is a Japanese staple, had a thin, soggy crust. (They were also shaped in balls rather than discs, which resulted in too much potato and not enough breading).  The Dessert - Although the Matcha Creme Brulee was actually okay, the white sesame ice cream was terrible! I have never before had ice cream that felt dry in my mouth. It had a powdery texture which left you needing a few gulps of water with each spoonful.  The Atmosphere - All of this underwhelming food consumption happened while top 40s songs played over their sound system, and every 10 seconds or so, you'd hear the kitchen yelling in Japanese, which wouldn't have bugged me had it the staff's Japanese sounded extremely lazy and drawn out (instead of \"Onegai shimasu\", it was more like \"Ownaguy shee moossss\") And that was every 10 seconds.  Aftermath - My partner and I left the restaurant feeling extremely unsatisfied and proceeded to one of our preferred eateries for a more fulfilling snack.  Conclusion -  This place was nowhere near worth the price, and we were extremely unsatisfied. We felt the restaurant was trying to accomplish way too many things - trying to be a trendy fusion spot, but not having any fundamentals down - a shame to Japanese hosting that is so well loved for its intention and precision in atmosphere and cuisine. I would much rather have spent the night at Don Don on Dundas or Guu Izakaya on Church, where although there are fusion options, the atmosphere and quality of food are far more satisfying."}
{"text":"Very fun/vibrant environment. Super chill, ordered about 75% of the late night menu items. Zero complaints about any of the dishes. Music was super good, hip hop/rnb mixes/urban pop... Guests were dancing by DJ as soon as they finished eating. Booked this resto for my birthday dinner party already :)."}
{"text":"Went here for a summerlicious dinner yesterday. I had the spot prawn ceviche, Halibut Steak Mushroom risotto and matcha creme brulé.  My friend had the Uni Chirashi, Spicy Miso Pork Ishiyaki and the Japple Pie Gyoza.  Overall the food was ok, but the portion sizes were a little off. The ceviche was delicious and a good portion for one, but the uni chirashi was quite small. My entree (risotto) was small, while the pork ishiyaki was enough for two people. The halibut was also quite dry and lacked seasoning. There were also no mushrooms. Both desserts were tasty.   My friend really enjoyed the pork ishiyaki so I'd probably go back again to try that. The waitress said its on their regular menu.   Service was great and the place has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"When I came here for Valentine's Day, my date had a crutch in one arm, and flowers in the other. He was struggling to get through the door and when the bartender saw him, he wanted to help him carry the flowers. However, the hostess scolded the bartender, \"No! The flowers are for his date! Let him carry it to her!\" It worked out and I blushed like a little school girl. The food was great and we had a Sparkling Shiso (yuzu and shiso liqueur with champagne).   I had the Baby Got Back BBQ Pork Back Ribs (tender fall off the bones, honey soy marinade with wasabi mashed potatoes). So good. Yummmmm.  It was nice."}
{"text":"I'm definitely glad I tried Hapa Izakaya! Having moved here from Vancouver, I was ecstatic that they opened in Toronto! I made a reservation for Friday night, and was seated right away when I arrived. The place was already packed by 7:30PM, all the waitresses were busy, but still made time to smile and greet us as we walked to our table.   The menu variety is pretty standard in terms of what you'd expect at an Izakaya. We tried almost everything on the menu, just to see how they compare to places to Guu and Don Don.   Result: The portions here are smaller, yet pricier. Nevertheless, the quality of food was worth it. The sashimi was really fresh, and not thawed like some other restaurants. The Negitoro (albacore tuna belly) was sooo yummy, we wished the portions were a little bigger. I liked the interior setup, much less crowded than Guu, and you won't be forced to share a table with others sitting on one bench!  The Not-So-Impressive: The Harajuku girl cocktail came in a very plain glass, and I barely tasted any alcohol. The karaage was not crispy at all, even though the chicken inside was piping hot. Parking was a pain in the butt - this area is super busy at night (took us around 20 minutes to find parking)."}
{"text":"Hapa is awesome. Perfect for a weekend night when you want something a little more fun and a little less intimate. We ordered four dishes which was a perfect amount of food for two (not starving) people.  Tips: - Sit at the bar. You're at an izakaya, it's more fun to sit at the bar. - Order whatever you want. It's all pretty much equally delicious. - Don't miss the maki. We had the crab tempura -- yum.  Next time, we'll try to head over for their Hapa Hour, which has tapas ranging from $2 - $5. Sounds great, right? Yeahhhhhhh."}
{"text":"On the pursuit of Hapa-ness, I ended up here thanks to Edwin's legendary UYE!  There are a lot of reviews here.  I'll keep it short and sweet.  Good Stuff * This place is way bigger than expected.  Spanking new, modern decor  * What?!... They actually take reservations and they can accommodate large groups * Service was good and with a smile * Less yelling than other Izakaya placees (*cough Guu*).  So, you can have a conversation with your dining partner and/or others  Food We had a special set menu, Omakase tasting for $29. I like how they started with lighter fare and had the heavier carbier items at the end.  But I found a lot of the items were seasoned and tasted the same. My favourite item was the Tuna Avocado Salad with crispy plantain chips. The halibut tacos and beef short ribs were good... but I wouldn't order them at an Izakaya place if I had a choice. Overall, I didn't find the food overly exciting... And no dessert?! Boooo....  They did have some interesting drinks though.  I want to try the pear martini. I had a fun night and I'd consider returning to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I think I've gone through most of Hapa's menu now, thanks to Edwin A's UYE here plus a separate visit of my own.  My favs: - Gindara - Tuna carpaccio - Tuna avocado salsa dip - cold sake served in the bamboo pitcher with bamboo cups - asahi black  To skip: - I found the rice dishes just okay. They are filling, but nothing special about them. - Halibut tacos. A bit too heavy on the tortilla ratio. - Karaage. You can't ruin fried chicken so if it's not absolutely delicious, then there's something wrong!  The atmosphere at Hapa is lively and fun, without being TOO loud *ahemGUU*. A solid place to eat at; you can't go wrong with an evening at Hapa!"}
{"text":"Hapa Izakaya has 3 established Vancouver area locations, so I had an idea that it might be pretty good going in... And they absolutely delivered. The food was incredible. The Beef Titaka must be tried. The sauce was so delicious and it worked so well with the beef and onions and sesame that we had no choice but to order another! Scallop Tartare was tender and fresh and perfect with crispy chips. All of the food was beautiful and out of this world! They have a creative bar menu that really works! Have a giggle while you enjoy the Hello Kitty Cocktail with fresh strawberry pure and soda :) Atmosphere was cool and stylish, but super warm and inviting at the same time. They have several large tables so this is the perfect place to bring many friends and family, or your best clients. It's sure to please even the most discriminating of tastes.  Service was bang-on and the staff made you feel pampered.  Thank you staff of Hapa Izakaya! See you soon."}
{"text":"Well, I visited the restaurant on a Sunday and wished that I could at least had the similar experience in the Vancouver location; unfortunately not even close. The food lacks of basic presentation and taste balance. If you are looking for some mind blowing dining experience, okay, let me rephrase, if you are looking for decent Japanese sushi sorted of like Vancouver level of quality, this isn't your place."}
{"text":"This place is large & great for large parties. Their drink prices are pretty good & very yummy. The food is also good, but not worth the high price. $20 for sushi that you could get for $12 at any other sushi place. The only difference was that they used a small torch to pop some caviar on the sushi so I guess there was a small show? The pork belly lettuce wraps were laughably tiny. You get five small squares of pork with lettuce & some pickled cabbage. I'm not disappointed, but I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Edwin's UYE, I had to come out to my brotha from another motha...even if it is College West..where people wear jeans smaller than your legs, and glasses that have no prescription.  The neighbourhood really is the ghetto for me..but secretly I'm becoming more fond of it...Yelp is taking affect on me.  I really liked one thing about this event, and that is the ability to meet other Yelper with comfort.  It is much better socially than an Elite event actually where everyone has somewhat--even just a bit--superiority complex.  If there were such a thing as Yelp Nobodys Event...then it'd be the closest thing to an orgy.    I arrived 8 minutes prior to 1800hrs, and has to wait 8 minutes by the parking metre until I can pay it.  Then I walked about 78 metres West (which is more West I would have liked to have walked) on College until I saw a woman smiling at me.  I looked up, and it says Hapa...I didn't smile back at her and proceeded into the door.   I couldn't figure out whi was a Yelper and who was restaurant staff, they were dressed similarily.  I took my seat with my Friend Jennifer K, and immediately I recognized the woman sitting across from me Kathy H.  I met Tony sitting next to me, and Kathy's Filipino/Scottish boyfriend.   I don't know what a Isakaya was, and Jennifer told me it meant a place to drink, which set an expectation for the food.  I was trying to figure out what wine to purchase, and my waitress gave me a sample of their most popular pear sake.  I screwed my face in disgust after tasting it, and ended up just ordering the chianti.   Immediately after the wine came, I remembered that I was driving, so I offered to share it with Jennifer, and drank only below the legal amount stated by the Government of Ontario because I respect the Law and fear the crazy ducks who works for MADD....  9 course meal took around two hours, which just about left everyone starving for marvin.  The portions were obviously meant to be split between two people, but our set up were four per portion.  So although we did enjoy each other's company, this was a Wild Wild West scenario over raw fish.   Each dish was announced by the waitresses, but it's not like I would have understood it because they were all announcing it in Japanese.   At one point, a waitress came with a second serving of taco thinking we have not yet gotten ours, but Jennifer K so honestly confessed to her that we indeed already had our share...which lead to a huge shout fest on how Jennifer was lying and didn't know what she was talking about.  We didn't end up getting the extra tacos, but the feeling of honesty was fulfilling enough...............  I'll say this, the girls here were pretty well dress to keep the patrons consistantly...hungry.  Even the girls who were chefs are cute.  Big plus yo.   It was a good place to exercise my Louboutons, and pocket bunny.  Pocket squares are done, pocket animals FTW.     I love that I got a chance to meet a bunch of people I've been meaning to meet, but somehow unable to because of the awkward barier some other event have.  Good on Edwin to take the time and effort to organise such events.  Shoutout to my pikey hating friend Bobby for taking the photos.    I'll come back here for sure...but ordering from a menu next time."}
{"text":"Some of the food's good but I still prefer Guu.  It's a little too fusion for my taste and I find that some of the seafood is not as fresh as it could be.  Either that or they cooked it to the point of becoming jerky.  The ebi mayo was my favorite and the fish tacos were pretty darn good but aside from that, I did not see too much that would arouse my palate.  I would stop by here if I were nearby and hungry."}
{"text":"the halibut risotto and lamb were amazing on the summerlicious menu. I personally really liked the sea urchin appetizer as well. also had the lettuce wrapped pork from their regular menu which was delicious. the white sesame ice cream had an amazing flavour- so creamy!  i didn't like how dry the mashed potatoes were that came with the lamb. Also the portions were small, as expected at an izakaya."}
{"text":"Came here for a company dinner a while back. Although I found the atmosphere of the restaurant to be very lively and entertaining, I wasn't a huge fan of the food. We had sake and beer given to us to start. The sake was poured in very cute bamboo cups; however, the cups appeared to be continually wet giving me the impression that it was not quite... sanitary? Then, the appetizers came. There was kimchi with seaweed and edamame beans soaked in soy sauce. Both were okay, but I did prefer the edamame beans because I felt the soy sauce gave it an additional depth of flavour. That being said, it was quite salty and I soon found my fingers stained. A variety of small dishes came soon afterwards. There was aburi (torched) sushi with some sort of flying fish eggs - the sushi was mediocre, and fell apart quite easily. The only cool thing was that they fired the top right in front of us. There was a hot stone pot with ground beef and an egg that was all mixed up when it arrived at our table too. Unfortunately, even though we left the bowl alone for a while, it failed to form any sort of rice crisp. There was also fried chicken (didn't taste it, but it looked pretty good). Overall, nothing particularly mind-blowing nor amazing. That being said, when we had our round of sake bombs, the staff definitely left a solid impression and was very effective/successful at creating a great atmosphere/ambiance!"}
{"text":"Second time trying such a restaurant and if it was not for the crowd and the service I would have left feeling rather disappointed.  The set menu we tried was the Japanese version of tapas dishes but smaller and more variety but still meant a stomach which was not at full capacity at the end.  I had absolutely no clue what I was eating so I am looking at the reviews below to name the ones that I liked.   The Beef Tataki, the Nigitoro and the Halibut were really nice, so much so I made many futile attempts to steal them off Jen K's plate.   The layout, the feel of the restaurant and the service were great. Waitresses were attentive and hot and they managed to remember everyone's drinks orders.   Me and Brian went for some sake bombs which were pretty pricey considering its a shot of weak sake with little amount of beer. How about some sake bomb offers? The beer on tap was good, always a fan of any place that serves Sapora   The little things:  - televisions around the place make it lose its authenticity because they are showing poker and sports? Cheesy samurai movies or anime would be better or even some Japanese music but not sports please.  - the men's wash room has only one but also biggest urinal I have seen it looks silly and results in too much splash back, please get rid and put something normal in there.  - some sort of bench seating outside which means people sitting around smoking giving it that pub look from the outside.  This place gets a Samurai Chukanbushi ranking from me."}
{"text":"Sorry about the last review had to re-edit this I totally reviewed the wrong place while writing about this place!  The environment is still very similar to Guu on bathurst and bloor. The entire staff greets you with a warm welcoming by saying hello in Japanese.  My Friend's Boyfriend treated us to a dinner here which we ordered the sake that came in the bamboo container supposedly from straight from japan. For someone like me who hates any form of alcohol this sake went so well with the sashmi we ordered.  Incredible servers that are awfully jolly all the time and I recommend you to try the the Tuna Carpaccio.. simply pure bliss in my mouth!  Unfortunately they did happen to forget to bring out one dish but at the same time they were celebrating one of their employees birthday!  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I came along with a large party of 20+ guests so the fact that we could all be seated at the same table was a great start to the evening.   The menu had a lot of fresh and interesting choices and although not many vegetarian options on the many they were happy to modify and offer suggestions so that was appreciated. The service was outstanding and quite honestly some of the best in Toronto. Our servers were knowledgeable and passionate about their menu and this attention to detail was noted.   If you're looking for delicious food in a cool setting with exceptional service than I would check Hapa out!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, wow.  Definitely a place we'd go back to.  Only drawback is the loud music.  Compared to Guu, Fin, and Don Don... I think I'd prefer Hapa.  Every dish tasted amazing, and left us wanting more.  Good thing we stopped b/c it'd be pretty darn pricey otherwise."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday there on a Tuesday night. Half off wine bottles and sake- BONUS! There were only 3 of us. The amazing staff surprised me with a birthday song, ice cream and a small glass of cider which they cheered me on to chug. Best way to end the day and celebrate with good food, music and people.   New favorite on the menu: the mackerel pressed sushi"}
{"text":"Shoot someone got to this before I did.  Faithful fan of Hapa's Vancouver exploits.  The one in Toronto had been open for only 8 days when I came, and it was absolutely packed.  Toronto's come late to the Izakaya game but it's catching on like wildfire now (see also Guu) and with good reason; it is a fun night out to try new things for a decent price - with drinks and a ton of food it all came to about $35 a person.    Great selection of tasty hot tapas - you really can't go wrong with any of them -  with particular note to the halibut tacos (or wraps), which were spectacular, a must order.   They have the staples that are in every location, like the Ika squid, the pork gyoza, and chicken karrage; all made the same way.  I noted Ebi Mayo was good, although there was no mayo on it, unlike the Vancouver version.  The drink menu looks very familiar, especially the spiked pear lemonade, my favorite.  The rice bowls, like in Vancouver, are ok and represent the weakest part of the menu as we don't find that the rice ever gets crispy on the sides of the bowl even if we wait awhile.    It is a little loud in there, and there were a few small flies that buzzed around us, but these were minor annoyances in the overall scheme of the experience, which was  fantastic and a real treat to the others in our group who have never tried Hapa.  Everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Although the DJ was lit the night I came, I found the service to be good but confusing -- had like 4 servers that night?? And the food was just okay. I didn't find anything to stand out to me as much as the lightly seared meat which I didn't really like at all. The pork belly number was pretty good.   I ordered a drink but it wasn't to my liking, so thankfully the male server I had took it off, but wouldn't really recommend this place tbh. There's way more better places in the area and surrounding"}
{"text":"We came here for UYE organised by the generous host Edwin.  First off hats off for coordinating such an event at this unheard of scale for a UYE. 5 Stars for the result. Now for the Izakaya itself I guess I can rate it using various criterion. Setup, Drinks and service are top notch. Where it falters is on the food which can make or break this spot for you.  We took the set menu which consisted of 11 course meal shared family style with some additional surprise courses thrown in for good measure; Edmame. I don't know how to rate this course as it is boiled soybeans for crying out loud. Tuna with Avacado served with plantain chips. Initial idea seems good but the execution left a lot to be desired. The tuna was chopped so fine that it was devoid of texture. Needs a bit of zing. Beef Tataki. One of the better dish on this set menu just the right amount of zing to elevate the beef. Garlic chips provided the crunch and hot sauce and onions provided the zing. Tuna Sashimi; Beautiful presentation and nice color on the tuna. Visually appealing. Tuna Ball with garlic bread. Tuna belly was wasted on this dish as this as it was chopped too fine to lend any texture or taste for this prized delicacy.  Ebi Mayo: A very good version of this signature Izakaya dish. Nice crunchy crust and nicely spiced mayo. Top marks here. Halibut Taco: A surprising dish for an Izakaya. It was a good taco but unexpected for a Japanese place. Beef Ribs:  First thought when I saw this was oh goodie Kalbi! but its not the Korean take on beef ribs rather a mundane take on beef ribs Chicken Karage: Nothing special here folks lotsa batter and the chicken could have benefited if dark meat was used. Noodles with Chicken. I could have this dish at any place as it was bland. Pork Gyoza and Ishitaki. I didn't try these dishes.  Now don't get me wrong for 29$ its a good value as one gets to try so many dishes but the food leaves something to be desired as there are few highs and rest is your run of the mill stuff that one can get at other spots The Beer and Cocktail menu is very nice (pretty much anything from Unibrue rocks) that means it can be a great spot to drink and the service is top notch. The food unfortunately needs to improve to put it in the upper echelon of the Toronto Izakaya Scene. 3.5 Stars all said and done."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. We had to wave people down for service. When we finally got someone they told us we couldn't order the food 23 wanted and gave us night menus. We wont be back"}
{"text":"I will give this place 3 stars ONLY because our server was friendly, informative, and very professional.  Otherwise, the food is overpriced for small portions.  A third of the beef tataki slices were chewy due to the strand of gristle that was embedded into the cut of meat.  I ate it anyways since the portion was tiny.  I didn't see the point in sending it back.  The sashimi was very fresh but the slices were quite small.  Negitoro was like Japanese bruschetta, since it came with toasted bread for you to scoop it onto.  It was disappointing that the sesame oil overpowered the fish and you could barely tell it was toro.  The Hello Kitty drink was quite yummy.  I might go back for drinks, not dinner."}
{"text":"Meh.  I don't get all the fuss, to be honest.  It was alright and it is fairly inexpensive.  Pork belly was pretty good.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  It's not bad though."}
{"text":"Thanks to Edwin for a great job on the amazing UYE.  parked right in front of the place, you can park on street starting at 6pm, max 3 hours and that's $6.75 all in.  out front is a small patio (stand up area for people to smoke while enjoy their drinks?) once you step inside, you found yourself in a bar. you really don't feel like you are in a Japanese restaurant.  a thing I don't like, is that they use disposable chopsticks that is already opened. at least put it in a sleeve with the restaurant name printed on it.   the food:  The edamame is kind of boring and looks brown on the edges. I guess it's the marinade, may be they should use white soy sauce?  Tuna avocado salad with plantain chips, meh. Mushy when you have it with the chips, better feel to it when eaten alone.  Same goes for the Toro (tuna belly meat) meat ball with the garlic bread, just like what Laura mentioned, too much bread, and it's like a paste when you put it on the garlic bread. once again, eaten alone feels much better. you can't really tell if it's just tuna or tuna belly, too much sauce on it...  ***the beef tataki is the highlight of the day, it got the kick from the hot sauce and the lemon that the Tuna lacks, and it has a great balance of texture with the onion and small pieces of tortilla chips.  Tuna Carpaccio, it's great, the sauce is perfect (as I like the sour citrus taste, turns out it's Yuzu?)   Ebi Mayo is next, tempura shrimp with a spicy mayo dressing, it's okay. One of the shrimp's meat feels a bit mushy, or may be it's some of the batter not being cook through, I'm not going to pull it out from my mouth to confirm it...  Renkon Gyoza Tempura, Lotus root sandwiched some minced pork meat (and veggie?) and tempura fried. it's something I used to have all the time at home that my mom would cook, and we are not Japanese. it's barely okay, and the dipping sauce taste like just some soy sauce with garlic and sesame oil or something like that, it actually doesn't taste good together. need some kind of acidity to cut the fattiness...  Halibut Taco, I can't tell what kind of fish when I'm eating this. too bad, the flour tortilla just too thick for this and it masked everything else. At the table we all say it should try with some kind of rice paper or something much lighter for it...  Beef short ribs, it's the thinnest beef short ribs I have seen in restaurants. you cook 1 side of it and it's done, literally paper thin...  Karaage, Fried Chicken. really, I had better. they actually forgot the whole garnish on one of the plate...  Ishi-Yaki, minced pork in spicy miso sauce over rice in a hot stone bowl. need more vegetable? it need something...  Yaki Udon, stir-fried noodles with vegetable and chicken. looks good, taste bland.  on to drinks:  I order the special blend that was made for Hapa Izakaya, Izumi Hapa. it comes in a wine tasting glass? would be great as a finish to the meal, but I had it the first thing at the beginning... taste pretty good, actually you can taste the banana in it.  later on we shared a pitcher of Asahi, and I liked the glass they use, it's tall. but the waitress did a bad job on pouring, the first glass has 90% of foam. and it's asahi, nothing special...  and finally as I saw someone else had the Asahi Black, so I asked the waitress to get me a bottle, and I ask how much it is (just wondering), and she didn't know, she goes for the drink menu, it's $7.5 a bottle. I liked the glass they serve it in, it's a small glass (cooler size?) with Asahi black logo and names and some Japanese word on it. we were saying we should take it home...  unfortunately, they don't have dessert for us in this set menu. so we asked for the dessert menu so we can have a look.  actually I did notice the panna cotta they serve from the table next to us, it's looks good, but we were all too full to have anything else.  one thing we notice, is that when they serve one of the fish dishes, the waitress will actually bring the blow-torch to the table to char the fish? that's really a new take on table side cooking for you.  overall, waitress are great, they did great in a busy time and able to handle the large group of us. the restaurant was quite noisy, in an acceptable way, it's an Izakaya after all.   4/15"}
{"text":"Hapa omakase! It started off well enough. The edamame had a surprisingly delightful soya flavour. With the exception of the fish taco, most of the seafood and plates with a 'raw' bent were done really well. The avocado salad was good, but nothing special. Loved the beef tataki, tuna sashimi, fire cracker rolls, negitoro spread with toast. They were all  surprisingly delicate in taste and very fresh. The ebi mayo strangely didn't do it for me. The flavour was all in the sauce and didn't really sink or mesh well into the shrimps themselves. That combo is usually an easy hit. Weird!   The cooked options that were all mostly left to the end generally missed the mark. The gyoza seemed kind of dry and flavourless to me. The fried chicken was yummy - have yet to go to an izakaya with awful chicken kara-age though. I gave away my portion of the fish taco. It just was not a well thought out piece. Too much veg not enough fish? Or overcooked fish? I have no idea! The rice stone pot was one of the final let downs. It didn't stand out and over powered my memories of the delicate flavours of the earlier dishes.   Finally, everyone in our party of 8 were left with a bit of a question mark when no dessert was offered to end of the evening. Where's the sweet or refreshing to end off a meal? We ended up counting how many dishes that we had as we were not sure if the meal was over. At least a dessert menu could have been offered? Or a simple statement from staff that the omakase was completed?  Oh well! Overall the service was actually quite excellent. The rowdy atmosphere appropriate for a fun night out without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Exactly opposite of what you expect from an asian restaurant: loud music, short menu, food is small and little overpriced ($11 for 6 rolls). We ordered three courses for two people, which is usually enough, but not there, we left hungry. Service was decent and courteous, but tap water just killed me, tasted horrible (I don't drink sodas/juices). Its worth a try, but Im not going again."}
{"text":"Hapa is the best izakaya that I've been to in Toronto. The food was amazing, the servers are very kind and always chekced up on us. The hello kitty drink is one of the best drinks I've had, highly recommend and don't be fooled by the name. At the end of the night it was so lively for a Sunday. Would definaly go again"}
{"text":"Hapa Hour!!!! 5:30-6:30 every day half priced apps.  Imagine you have access to the best of the best apps that they have and not have to feel gulity about it.  My lovely friend who is not easily impressed was bowled over by the polenta fries and deep fried shrimps.  The wraps were amazing and the drinks were flowing with citrusy abandon.  The service is sexy and impeccable.  They are beautiful and friendly.  How utterly charming.  I am going back there again and again and maybe even have a nice party there.  Why not!  Hapa good time!"}
{"text":"Dragon Ball Z and Live DJ.. the environment here on a Saturday was dope. We were a rather large group and they accommodated us pretty well. The lighting was very club like- and the hip hop music made it very easy to chill and have some drinks.  The food however-was a little too over priced for tapas. Guu, Nome and other izakaya's seem to have a much larger assortment and variety on the menu for much lower prices. Also the food was decent at best. Nothing to rave about when you spend $10 on 2 taco's.  Their drink menu was extensive and had a lot of choices. THey had 4 for $20 cocktail special and the Mr Miyagi drink went down pretty easily. There was a sherbert tasting cocktail called Miss Kitty. $12 is a bit much, but it tasted ok. Sapporo Towers are the best value they have and we ordered quite a few of those.  Is this a place I would go to just dine- probably not! With a large group. Was a lot of fun"}
{"text":"I'm very particular about Japanese food, and since this place is structured more like a bar/club (as some izakaya places are), I wasn't expecting anything too exceptional in terms of food.  I was incredibly surprised. The presentation was really cool (especially the firecracker), but the quality of the food was incredible. This is one of my favourite Japanese spots in Toronto now, and I haven't gone wrong with anything I've had there yet.  If you're looking for an izakaya establishment in Toronto this is a must-try."}
{"text":"The owner is a friend of one of my best friends and this is the place to go for tapas! I usually order 2 kobe beef tataki's for myself because they are so irresistible. On many birthday occasions we order a hidden 11 course dinner that feeds 3-4 but they always add extra on every dish to accommodate our group of 6. They will typically give out 4-5 dishes at once so we can fill our plates. My husband and I haven't been here for about a year so I'm hoping they still offer this! Besides the food, costumer service is top priority of theirs. They will always welcome you as soon as you walk through the door with the entire staff yelling out a Japanese greeting."}
{"text":"I bought a Travelzoo voucher for a 10 course meal for 2 people for $49. The food and service were absolutely AMAZING and worth every penny AND MORE!! Each course was absolutely delicious and got better and better as the courses came. The atmosphere was relaxing and the music was great. I was thoroughly please and will be back."}
{"text":"*UPDATE 07/JAN/2014* $15 for $30 worth of drinks/food at Hapa Izakaya via Groupon.  (Not valid during Hapa Hour) Click here to get the deal! http://gr.pn/1gdCwyb  While the ramen craze rages on in Toronto, I still prefer its predecessor the izakaya invasion for variety.  I love the food at Guu Izakaya, but am way too old to have Amazonian battle cries shouted throughout my meal every time a guest walks in.  It's novel when you walk in, but it quickly turns into an annoyance.  Hapa Izakaya, like Guu, is an outpost from Vancouver and they've been through a lot.  Having recently suffered from this summer's epic flood in Toronto (boy has Mother Nature really screwed with us this year), it was closed through the summer and then reopened at the end of October.  It's a casual and boisterous place (especially as it gets later) to grab a bite and enjoy a drink.  Prices and portion sizes are quite reasonable and there's a lot to choose from.  It's worth mentioning that there are daily drink specials in addition to Hapa Hour (5:30-6:30PM) featuring tapas under $5.  We decide to pass on the Hello Kitty cocktail and opt instead for a Shiso Mojito ($9.50) and Spiked Pear Lemonade ($8), both of which are relatively \"watered down\" drinks.  We ate:  Sashimi Salad with citrus-soy dressing, $9.50 (small) - The sashimi was very fresh and plentiful  and there was just the right amount of dressing in the greens though really, they didn't do much to enhance the dish.  I would've been just as happy with just the sashimi.  Hapa Hot Wings, lightly fried, with spicy Serrano chili sauce ($7.99)- The chicken was juicy, but flavor-wise was rather bland.  I didn't care much for the sauce either.  I definitely regret not having ordered the karaage.  Ika - Grilled squid, sake soy garlic marinade $8.99- The grilled squid was tender, moist, and had a nice char to it.  I would definitely recommend it.  Beef Short Ribs - Grilled AAA beef short ribs, apple-soy marinade ($12.99)- One of our favorite dishes.  Nice grill marks, charred flavor, nicely caramelized and a good meat-fat-bone ratio.  Yummy!  Ebi Mayo - Tempura prawns, spicy mayo sauce ($8.99)- Another favorite of the evening were these Ebi Mayo shrimps lightly coated with a \"Thousand Island\"-like sauce.  If you've ever had the Rock Shrimp salad at North 44, these are pretty reminiscent of that dish.  Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps - Crispy pork belly, apple yuzu jam, pickled red onions and butter lettuce ($9.49)- I love eating things that require assembly.  The pork belly was juicy without being overly greasy, and the lettuce was shaped perfectly round and were great serving platforms for the pork belly.  Easy peasy.  I wasn't that thrilled with dessert, though desserts aren't usually the highlight of an izakaya. We had a pumpkin custard and a matcha roll cake.  The custard was creamy and smooth, no complaints there.  The matcha roll cake however, I found to be a bit dry and loosely reminded me of the butter roll cakes one can purchase at a Chinese bakery.  Both desserts were not bad, but not exciting.  One thing that does make Hapa better than its other izakaya counterparts is service.  The servers are attentive, sociable and really down-to-earth.  I can't help but think that the menu is having a bit of an identity crisis as it struggles between offering traditional izakaya fare and then halfway down the page you see wings, polenta fries and a chipotle beef curry dish.  Sadly, the best part of the meal is the sashimi, which isn't normal izakaya fare.  In terms of tastiness, it definitely doesn't hold a flame to Guu or DonDon but I'd definitely come back for Hapa Hour."}
{"text":"We went in chanting, \"Vancouver, Vancouver!\". We were so excited to eat some nostalgia, and we were not disappointed!  Izakaya is Japanese for tapas so we shared a lot of stuff.  TUNA AVOCADO SALSA DIP.  This was so good, we ordered two.  It came with delightful unsalted chips and the flavor of the avocado with the tuna was just the best.  NEGITORI.  This was quite yummy, almost like a sushi spread on bread.  The flavors were quite light and didn't taste fishy, we just swept the entire plate with the bread to soak up the sauce!  GOMAE-AE.  I always get the GOMAE-AE, this was a special take on it. Rather than just spinach, it had green beans and radish slivers.  The flavors still tasted like GOMAE-AE.  I like the one from Guu better.  ABURI SABA.  This was so cool, our server brought over fish (fish was makeral)  on a dish and a torch... She lit our fish on fire at the table and put it onto a pretty plate for us.  The fish was just lightly seared, and very tasty with the sweetish savory ponzu sauce.  I asked the waitress whether she felt nervous using the blowtorch, she said she had been practiticing, thank goodness!!!!!  EBI MAYO.  this was very tasty, not like your regular japanese EBI tempura, they used massive tiger shrimps battered lightly in tempura smeared in wonderful flavored mayo sauce.  This was probably one of my favorites.   BEEF SHORT RIBS.  This was my favourite dish of the night!  The flavors of the short ribs were just grilled to perfection.  Topped with raw onions, it was so delicious!  Must get!  AGEDASHI TOFU.  Pretty standard, delicious but nothing too different there.  IKA.  nothing too different from a Japanese restaurant but it was very tasty.  PORK BELLY LETTUCE WRAPS.  this was pleasantly surprising, the pork was tender and well done.  They lettuce was cute, they didn't use the regular stuff and it was actually cute!  The presentation and taste were quite delicious!  Lastly, YAKI UDON.  We ate a lot, but I had to spurge for the noodles because noodles are my favourite things in the world.  They did it well, they had the better quality udon noodles.   I think I like the flavor of the one from Guu better but the portion was much larger at Hapa!    We ordered just about everything, the prices were fair (ranged from about $7 - $15) and the taste was heaven.  We drank a lot of cold house sake which was very reasonably priced and served in a cold bamboo vase with bamboo cups, very neat.  The service was super friendly, and the food came out fast.  The environment was loud and vivacious, not for all, but it fuels the energy of the restaurant.  I would highly recommend, and they take reservations!!!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place. Went with a groupon and I think it's well worthy it. It's a nice sub for Guu for us, with similar food but much lower noise level. Server is nice too. Recommend it if you are in the area craving for izakaya type of food."}
{"text":"@hapaizakayaTO It was my first UYE ever, and thank you to Edwin A. that graciously planned this awesome outing. It totally beats waiting in line and trying to stuff all the food that I want to try because I get to share (and care) with lots of great company!  Sitting in the old Coco Lezzone spot (I recognized the layout before the location), this Vancouver import is an excellent addition to the saturated College West strip.  Servers were friendly, atmosphere was fun and casual. Other  than our big group, I saw a lot of families with their kids (mostly asian/Japanese) and some Japanese businessmen. Don't know if anyone else noticed.   When you enter, the chefs shout \"HEY!\" which was interesting, instead of the traditional \"Asyyyamasay!\".   We all got the $29 Omakase menu. Not sure if this is always available, for just a set menu made up for us. It consisted of the dishes that were on their regular menu, given to us, and meant for sharing. I think it's the only way to get the most value out of places like this. Share everything, try more stuff.  Here's what I thought, and what I can remember: Overall the portion sizes were really good and worth the $. EDAMAME  - soaked in soy (maybe miso), it was a great taste and change to the traditional sea salt TUNA AVOCADO SALSA DIP - this was my favourite. And I'm a sucker these days for anyone that uses plantains for chips. It had a really good mix of flavours. BEEF TATAKI  - slightly seared beef with some chilli sauce. I liked this too, tangy, and spicy. over 10 pcs TUNA CARPACCIO -  ahi tuna with a yuzu dressing. yum. 6 pcs NEGITORO - Tuna belly with garlic bread. I was't too impressed with the garlic bread. They could have been a little more asiany and creative with this. Would have been better with a flat bread, as the garlic bread (with little flavour) was too much bread with each bite. EBI MAYO - tasty shrimp tempura with a mayo sauce. nothing special but good tasting.  HALIBUT TACO - I didn't like this too much. It was just the fried fish in a wrap. The wrap was cold. RENKNON GYOZA TEMPURA - lotus root with pork dumpling, deep fried. I liked this. Although I've never seen it before Billy claims its a staple Chinese dish and thought it was weird it was on the menu.  KARAAGE - never really a big fan of karaage in general. It was tasty, but could have used more batter on the fried chicken. BEEF SHORT RIBS - I love short ribs of any kind. These were thin (better?) and not the fatty kind you get in Korean places. They were really good in my opinion despite the feel at the table. SPICY PORK ISHI-YAKI - minced pork, with lots of stuff and an egg in hot stone bowl. personlly tasted like a kimchi bimbimbap. There was too much sauce and the rice could not 'self-fry' itself properly. Meh. It was okay, I prefer the one at Guu. Jennifer K. loved it so much she kept stealing it from our table :D YAKI UDON - i liked, but I was so full at this point I moved notches on my belt. smooth with chicken. tasty.   No dessert.   I really liked the Omakase menu (don't get me wrong) but I don't think I personally would have picked these dishes on my own right.  I want to try -  Chipotle Beef Curry Ishi-Yaki (rice) or the mushrooms one Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps Ika (grilled squid) Hot wings Scallop Tartare  I would definitely have the Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip, Beef Tataki, and the short ribs again."}
{"text":"Hapa is a chic place for drinks and a little food but it's definitely not a traditional izakaya...which was a little disappointing. all the dishes were Japanese inspired with some western flare. The only thing i absolutely regretted getting was the hapa-dog. For my west coast friends, this hapa dog is the poor man's japadog. It was really heavy with lots of creamy toppings. that didn't stop me from eating the whole thing but that's my bad. The negitoro, kimchi udon, ika, and agedashi tofu were all tasty but nothing to write home (or yelp) about.   Being Japanese, I was looking for a more traditional selection...my quest for an awesome izakaya continues  I wouldn't come here again for dinner but I would for after work (happy hour 4-6!) or late night drinks."}
{"text":"The vibe was good. The music was great but mostly top 40s which I liked anyway. The crowd is very easy and chill and the patio was open for hanging out. We went here for a friends birthday. If you have a large group please make sure you reserve in advance as space is limited. We had 28 people join for Summerlicious dinner and it was insane. Dinner started late at 9pm and we stayed till roughly around 1am-ish. Overall, great crowd, great service, good food. Nothing to complain about. BTW we were here on a Saturday evening. Not sure what it's like during the day."}
{"text":"Hapa on a Sunday night; I was really excited about trying this place.  The service is super friendly, although dishes were slow in coming out. I was not drinking alcohol but the drinks menu looked really good. The restaurant is a great size and it decorated beautifully; very inviting and feels intimate.    We tried:  Tuna Sashimi - fresh, light and delicious, decent sized pieces too.  Beef Short - tender and   Renkon Gyoza Tempura - I could have eaten a hundred of these      Pork Belly lettuce wraps - juicy, tender and tasty    Halibut Tacos - easily the best dish I had, I loved this! The halibut is crispy, the condiments add heat.  Chicken Kara-age - crispy, well flavoured  Mackerel Sashimi - blow torched at the table, get past the smell (might be too fishy for some people) and this dish is delicious  I shared the matcha fudge - wow, is all I can say...it was heavenly.  I know we tried more than this but these were my most memorable dishes. The slightly disappointing thing was a lot of the dishes contained pork so a couple of my friends were quite limited in what they could have as they do not eat pork.   That said the food was really good.   It  ain't cheap but then I was not expecting it to be. The food was good, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Hapa awesomeness.  Great service  great food and cheap beer.    Good music  too at night.  MacKenzie is awesome."}
{"text":"It was our first time going to Happa Izakaya but it will now be the first of many. We had amazing service accompanied with delicious food. Ordered the avacado tuna dip-loved it, fish tacos- TO DIE For, probably the best we have ever had and a hot rice bowl which was amazing as well!   Definitely going back soon with lots of friends next time-good food and company with a chilled out ambiance (if you love old school hip hop, this your place)!"}
{"text":"I found the decor was really nice.Loved the dim lighting and felt comfortable there. The music however was obnoxiously LOUD and annoying. The waiter was really nice and all but the portions were TINY. We left not realizing how it was that we spend so much money and came out still with an appetite!! The dishes were ok but i would agree with the other reviewers that GUU is of better quality and quantity!"}
{"text":"Looking for a restaurant before we went to the Mod Club, my partner and I stumbled across Hapa.   The service was friendly and attentive. The music was on a throwback that day.  We ordered from the happy hour menu.   We had the fire cracker pressed sushi, which was torched at the table! Amazing flavour profile and presentation. The fish was fresh and the spicy mayo was actually spicy!   We had the lettuce wraps, which were divine. We had to wrap the pork belly ourselves, which was nice. The sauces complimented the pork belly. And the pickled veggie really cuts through the richness!   The karaage was super filling and flavourful. No dry chicken here!   The slider baos were delicious but super heavy. Be prepared for that!   The only dish that wasn't great was the halibut tacos. Absolutely lacking in flavour, but plenty of garnish ok top. The fish was delicious itself but very plain and bland. 1/10."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious! Every item is on point and the service is very attentive and friendly. Been here a couple times and it's great for dinner as well as a night out for drinks!"}
{"text":"If Toronto's Japango and Joeys had a baby, it would be Hapa Izakaya.   The feel of the restaurant is mainstream, with a playlist of classics from Usher and Amerie - yet Japanese, with boisterous and unisonous shoutings of \"IRRASHAIMASE!\" as you enter. The decor is dark and mysterious, yet warm and inviting. And like mixed kids, effortlessly cool and good looking. If I was Riverside Flowers next door, I would totally have a restaurant crush.  The food looks just as beautiful as the decor, but not as great tasting. The lobster motoyaki and halibut tacos stood out as the more unique items on the menu, but did not live up to the potential of their names. The oshizushi and kinoko ishitaki (mushroom rice in a stone bowl) have a tad too much rice to topping ratio. And just when you thought you found a pesce substitute for foie gras, make no mistake...the smoked sea foie gras is not nearly as good as the real thing.   The desserts all sound really unique and appetizing. So, like any two responsible and health conscious young ladies...we got them all.   Japple pie gyoza - Amazing! The warm cinnamon-appley filling goes nicely with the crispy gyoza shell and cold green tea ice cream  Matcha brûlée - The chefs have clearly perfected their blow-torching skills from the aburi sushi. The top is perfectly charred, a great match for the creamy matcha  Ichigo chocolate fudge - Don't be fooled by the \"ichigo\" prefix that makes it sound like a super exotic Japanese chocolate. It is simply chocolate truffle-esque bars with strawberry puree. Not bad, but not unique. Cheesecake souffle - The description reads \"lemon\" cheesecake, but there were no traces of lemon. Regardless, it is still a cool item as the texture is very different from a regular cheesecake   Basically, this place would be a perfect venue for a first date. The fun and seductive atmosphere would immediately impress your date. The price point is modest, but not too much so. The food is good but not amazing, but marginally so that you won't notice over your first date nerves."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate NYE, pre booked a table ahead of time - highly recommend reservations here especially for special occasions.  Some of my friends have already visited Hapa but my first impression of it was that it's a mid twenties to mid thirties crowd restaurant/lounge with very attractive staff.   We ordered some food, no complaints at all. They served us everything within a reasonable amount of time considering it was packed! The quick service allowed us to buy more bottles before last call hehe  Paula took care of us on NYE. Drop dead gorgeous! Provided us with excellent service and will be the reason for me to visit again. Beautiful, attentive, outgoing and sweet. I can't rave enough about her and you'll understand what I mean when you meet her.   They had a DJ there throughout the night. Great option to spend the night especially if you don't feel like clubbing."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night to celebrate my birthday with a large group of friends. I love how easy going they were about making a reservation for a big group as it doesn't seem like it's an easy thing to do in the city. I really appreciate the fact that they did not require a minimum spend for the group and splitting bills was done easily.   I ordered the Ebi Mayo and Teriyaki Bao Sliders. The Ebi Mayo was delicious, not too spicy and the perfect size. The Teriyaki Bao Sliders however were not quite what I was expecting. There were copious amounts of wasabi on the buns making it not the most pleasurable experience for me as wasabi is not my favourite condiment.   Lastly one thing I didn't quite understand was the charge of the cheesecake on my bill. As a nice gesture my friend had mentioned to the waitress that it was my birthday. The waitresses then proceeded to sing happy birthday and approached with a cheesecake lit with a sparkler. While the gesture was nice, I was thrown off guard when I received my bill with an $8 charge for something that not only did I not order, but also something that I could not eat. (The cheesecake had nuts and I am allergic). My friend, assuming that the cheesecake slice would be on the house did not realize until after that I had paid for it.  *I would also like to mention that my friend did not specify which dessert or know that they would bring one for me. I would have mentioned something at the time of however I didn't want to inconvenience anyone. I wold just beware if you plan to celebrate there too.   Overall I did enjoy the experience I had at Hapa. It was my first time at the restaurant and I would go back again, especially to try the Firecracker Sushi that I heard good things about."}
{"text":"What a great place! We ordered some sushi, short ribs, bao, wings, fried chicken and beef wraps and all of it was yummy. The ribs had lots of flavour, the chicken crispy and good, the sushi was finished table side with a torch and had such a unique flavour. My only complaint would be the baobab wasn't as fluffy as some but the filling was fun and tasty. It was only $35 pp with a 20% tip. The service was incredible.  Very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best!!!! The food is amazing and the service is top notch!! I recommend this place to all of my friends and colleagues!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Liive Thursday. Every second and last Thursday of the month there is a live band and DJ. The music was a mix of R&B and hip-hop which was right up my alley.   The crowd was a good mix of people, but generally 20's. The atmosphere is very lively, and despite being a restaurant, many people got up to dance.  I ordered a spiked pear lemonade, which consisted of Absolut, pear purée, lemon, and Sprite. It was very refreshing and light. Service was good, only thing was we had to wait quite a bit of time to pay for our bill, which is understandable given the crowd.   Overall verdict: Great vibes, great music, would definitely come back to try their food."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant again after stopping by for a friend's birthday a week before. My friend and I came to watch the Raptor's game along with some Japanese and sake. We moved our reservation from the dining room to the bar area to hear the game sounds. The hapa sake was the best part of the meal.  For the dinner, it was quite disappointing. Out of the food, the miso mussels from the bar menu were amazing. However, the sashimi salad was average while the the sushi bites were  lacking.  I realize that this is a fusion restaurant but the sushi rice was not good and the 4 different types (dynamite, B.C Salmon, fish & chips and bacon & scallop) were small and nothing special at all.  I didn't try the meat dishes as my friend only eats seafood and veggies.  Overall, the restaurant has the atmosphere and the entire restaurant was filled for the most part. I will likely return for some small snacks and sake instead of a full meal.  My friend told me they have sake specials on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was excellent. I went with my family and we tried a bunch of dishes: vegetarian udon, spicy shrimp rice, sushi bites, wings, lobster pressed sushi, pork belly wraps, beef ribs and a few more dishes. There was nothing wrong with the food but I didn't find anything to be memorable. The portions are also incredibly small. I definitely prefer Guu and Nome"}
{"text":"Having done a review in 2 years, I'm starting this up again as people have requested.  Today, let's begin with Hapa Izakaya  This place is right in the middle of a beautiful area - Littlie Italy.  I had the opportunity to try this place out on a weekday right after work and I have to say, I was quite impressed.  I arrived at this restaurant at around 530 on a Wednesday, so not a lot of people were there.  We were told by the waitress that we are still in Hapa Happy Hour, where you can order some of their fans favorite from a special menu at a discounted price.  My friend and I order a few dishes but I was especially impressed with two items:  Beef Tataki Ebi Mayo  I would recommend this place if you are around the area.  Is this the best I ever had? Not really, there are a lot of competitions now when it comes to izakaya such as Guu, Ryoji, Fin and Nome.  But I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"With its colourful LED lighting, Hapa looks more like a night club than a restaurant, and that's really not too far off.   We were seated at the back of the restaurant by the kitchen and the first thing we noticed was the strong smell of urine coming from the bathrooms. It was too much, so we asked to be moved and were seated closer to the front where the smell wasn't noticeable. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, though this was my first red flag. How can you not notice the smell?  Ordered the flight of sake and got three different kinds. They tasted very watered down and had none of the alcoholic punch you'd expect from good sake. I switched to Asahi after, which was perfect and ice-cold.  Food was so so. The tuna sashimi was fine, but the tempura dishes were limp and greasy. Not very good at all.  I ended up going to the men's room, and oh my god what a nightmare. It smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in years, and there were flies everywhere. The stench of urine was so strong I had to hold my breath, no wonder it was wafting out into the dining area. Closer to the sink, it smelled strongly of vomit, so I just left, grabbed my girlfriend (who was looking at the dessert menu) and left. I was so disgusted I didn't want to spend another second in there, let alone eat food.  This wasn't the result of a broken pipe, or a sewage leak, this was just a bathroom that had never been cleaned and left to fester. And this was at the beginning of the night, not after a busy service. I've been to rummy bars with cleaner bathrooms, how could ANYONE want to eat food while smelling that? How can the staff not address it? Disgusting."}
{"text":"Had their mackerel sashimi and beef tataki. Not bad. It was fresh and delicious. Would like to go again sometimes to try out some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"Tried the fixe prize meal with four other friends. The food took a long time to arrive due to a private party happening (guess they were first priority). The waitress was nice and kept apologizing for the food delay so we weren't too angry about it.   The food was great but felt $30 a person for 4 people to get the set menu was a bit expensive. The portion was the same if we had order it separately, and it would have came out cheaper....   I would come back again but during \"Hapa hours\" where the tapas are cheaper and the place less crowded."}
{"text":"Recently tried Hapa and think I it's one of the better Asian tapas places in Toronto. We didn't know what to order so our server recommended some things, and I gotta say they didn't disappoint! I LOVED the tuna and avacado dip with plantain chips. We also got ebi mayo and this rice dish that came in a stone bowl, both also really good. Overall good food, good service and they had drink specials so I'll definitely be back haha."}
{"text":"The interior of this place is really nice - looks more lounge-y like than restaurant like, and it can accommodate large parties (there's a whole section in the back - behind the curtain!)  the service was really friendly and the presentation of the food was really nice, but I was underwhelmed with everything we ate - there was no pop of flavour, just a bit bland.  We ordered just a few items to share:  - Karaage - Shrimp Tempura  - Tuna Carpaccio  Nothing really stood out to any of us unfortunately and I don't think we would go back for this place specifically."}
{"text":"The food is good. Well prepared, great sauces and good quality. Some choices seem more about the marketing, though.   The buns for the bao sliders were not bao buns, so these are really just sliders.   The choice of waygu for the meatballs actually takes away from the dish, as the texture is much too soft. Personally, I think waygu should only be used as steak, seeing it ground here for meatballs - and elsewhere used for a brisket - it seems to be used for the name rather than its inherent qualities.  The seafood rice bowl was delicious, but there had to be maybe one piece of shrimp in it.  That said, four tapas dishes for $40 is pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Guys, take a breath and experience probably the best Japanese tapas in Toronto. Sounds like I'm being paid for this post? No. I'm just drunk and super elated with the meal I just ate.  Flame roasted Saba fish that melts in your mouth, fried chicken that has a perfect ratio of batter to chicken and then there was the Ishiyaki (which is like a bibimbop but better somehow).  Love it."}
{"text":"Came here for a company Christmas party. Disturbingly good food. The fried chicken and teriyaki sliders were particularly amazing. Great backroom with an open kitchen and a nice front bar area. There's no half way about it. This place is full on good."}
{"text":"Second time going to Hapa (went there once two years ago when they had a Groupon) -- this time it was for a Summerlicious dinner.  The starter was good (Japanese arancini) though the flavour wasn't very distinct. It sort of felt like I was eating a filet-o-fish but in ball form.  I got the main with the grilled lamb and mashed potatoes. It came with veggies that resembled gai-lan (which were weirdly super bitter). I couldn't really taste the sauce that came with it.  Dessert was a bit better with the white sesame ice cream and apple pie gyoza.  Overall, it wasn't bad, just not what I expected."}
{"text":"Anytime a familiar place from Vancouver opens in Toronto, one cannot help but make comparisons.    Did I frequent Hapa Izakaya in Vancouver is an understatement? LOL....I lived down the street.  I walked by it on the way home from work each day. To say, familiar with the food is an understatement.   But this is a new venue so I am giving this a `college try!`  Walking in during its opening hour on a Saturday, I was greeted by the bartender and hostess. Both managers of the restaurant from what the website said.  I was seated promptly but it was clear that they were booked with reservations. By the time I left, an hour later, the house was full.  Definitely borrowing that dark and atmospheric setting from its predecessors, it does so with class and seriousness.     As one is seated you are greeting by the staff . Loud, fun and bellowing in unison! For someone experiencing it the first time, a bit of a shock. I love it though.  Here, you will find regular seating. Regulars of   Hapa Robson Street will find the shoeless section missing.  This was of my favorite parts of the place.   I  was disappointed that there was no fresh sheet menu .  I believe after they are open for a little longer that will appear as the menu insert states. I really was curious what they were going to make though. I enjoy ordering from that as well as the main.  What about the food? The food is almost as tasty as the Robson granddaddy.  In fact, if you have never been, this food experience is wonderful.  Dishes like the ishi yaki and aburi saba offer table side cooking.  Nothing like some fire and sizzle while you eat.  The drink menu has some very Japanese-esque options to choose from. I ordered Harajuku girl.  A cream soda flavored drink with the colours of hello kitty screaming from it. Very tasting. I could have drank those at night and wobbled on home.  The customer service is wonderful. Prompt and helpful to answer any questions.  With dishes meant to be shared, the prices are a bit on the pricier side from what I remember in the past. However, that being said, the flavors are zesty and after a few dishes you will be full.  A must have dish is the renkon gyoza. Made with pork and lotus root with a delightful dipping sauce. Ask for extra sauce if you can. You will want to use it for everything. Maybe that is just me though.  For those of you missing Vancouver, this is a welcome addition to the scene. It definitely will push everyones izakaya game up.  For newcomers to the izakaya scene, this is the best way to start."}
{"text":"Service is slow, but the servers are very apologetic about this.   The decor and ambience is nice. The place is pretty big. You can see the chefs prepare the food in an open concept kitchen.  The food:  1. Karaage: $10 - crispy and delicious. Price is on par with other sushi places  2. Lobster sashimi: $17 - I was really excited to have lobster sashimi because i havent seen this offered anywhere else. the most unique thing on the menu, but it wasnt any good. The lobster is pretty tasteless and rubbery even with the sauce provided. Not really worth the price. I would skip this.   3. mackerel sushi: $12 - this was my fave sushi. It was seared on the spot. So soft and flavourful. Order this and you won't be disappointed!   4. Fire cracker sushi - $13 - seared in front of us. It wasn't bad, but didnt stand out. The mackerel is better!   5. Chicken wings: $8 - this was nothing special, but pretty crispy.  6. Apple filled dumplings with white sesame ice cream: $7 - this was my second fave. Very unique. The filling Is in a gyoza. The homemade ice cream was the best. Very flavourful.  7. Peach alcoholic drink - this wasn't good. I can't remember the exact name, but it was bland.   Overall, this place is ok. For two people, the price came up to $110. Pretty pricey with food that was only somewhat unique. Granted, i didnt try everything on the menu, but It's a place I would probably only try once because there are other japanese tapas places in the city and this place didnt really stand out for the price i paid.   This place has potential, but they need to hire more wait staff and improve or add to some of the menu items. If I went back, I would try the bao sliders.  We couldn't get it because my friend doesn't eat beef. This place also seemed to be popular for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"We had the Summerlicious menu. The food was very disappointing. In my opinion, despite of the promotion, it ended up being very expensive for what it was. I will not come back to this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I got to meet the staff and they are just a fun loving crew, bringing their energy to the place which the clientele love. And the food is superb. I was recommended the spicy ebi mayo shrimp, the minced pork rice bowl, the tuna guacamole and the sablefish. All were flavorful and amazing. Another welcome addition to Little Italy's changing restaurant landscape."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and the food was pretty good. It got a little loud on saturday, I'd recommend checking it out on a weeknight if you want the best service and ambience."}
{"text":"To be clear, the food at Hapa isn't bad.  It's a bit boring and conventional - but it's solid izakaya fare.  My friend who grew up in the GVRD, now living in the Saskatchewan was visiting and was craving for a taste of Vancouver.  We had a big assortment of their items and everything was tasty and fresh.  However, it lacks what we consider 'real' izakaya fare - no grilled items to be seen.  I'm sorry but I consider grilled beef tongue to be essential to an izakaya.  But we got most of the items on the menu and everything was well-prepared.  So why the shitty rating?  To be honest, I've never been a fan of Hapa and I always considered it far inferior to other izakayas in Vancouver: Hapa sits well below the curve for me.  If Guu/Suika/Zakkushi is Betty, Hapa is Veronica.  The all-black theme, the lounge feel, the half-Asian/fusion angle and the areas Hapa is located in Vancouver -- it always had a strong whiff of... douchebag.  I feel like I should rock a fauxhawk and Affliction gear when I roll in here.  Maybe it's because I've always acquiesced into Hapa so my guy friends can oogle at the halfer waitresses.  If Hooters (or Cactus Club) classed it up a bit and served Japanese food - it's basically Hapa.  Case in point, I was ranting about this with my tablemates as we walked in and a very buxom lady greeted us and pulled up her dress before her boob fell out.  As a red-blooded male, I should appreciate this.  But I feel like I'm not really paying for the food, but I feel like a john paying to get plasticky young lasses to fake-flirt with me.  I know it's effective - but I abhor being touched/complimented by waitresses trying to squeeze a bigger tip out of me.  So in short, the food is perfectly acceptable at Hapa - but I just don't dig the whole feel of the place.  But I'm not their target market -- I'm not a souless yuppie. (shrug)"}
{"text":"Came here at their Hapa Hour.  Special menu with special price for tapas.  Beef tataki was delicious.  The beef was juicy, and the spicy sauce was a good match.  It was so delicious that we finally concluded our meal with one more order.  Negitoro, tuna on garlic toast , was good.  It would be better if the toast could be toasted a bit longer and made it crispier.  Mackerel sashimi was fresh and it was blowtorched at our table.  Hapa wings were deep fried with light batter.  Bourbon maple sauce was on the side and it was yummmm.  Green tea creme brulee was very rich in green tea.  Great dessert!  All servers are very friendly and cheerful.  They all shouted in Japanese at the time we asked for the bill.  I asked the server what did they say, and he said they first said the table#, and \"get the bill ready\", and then \"thank you\".  Great ambiance and it's such a nice place to hang out.   **There is a Green P close by**"}
{"text":"It's worth it just for the lobster motoyaki alone. I don't know if it's permanently on the menu, since it's listed as 'special tapas,' but my god it's delicious. The grilled squid is also amazing, as are the polenta fries. They're dipped in tempura batter and deep-fried and served with an arugula dip and a spicy mayo. The cocktails are also unique and inventive and the yuzu fizz is an interesting mix of gin, yuzu, cucumber and lemon. The service here is pretty prompt, which is great because the place gets pretty packed. I needed to use a Groupon and my phone was dead, and our server did me a huge favour by charging it in the back. The food's delicious, the staff are friendly and the menu is super cheap from 5:30 to 6:30pm (items for $2-$5)."}
{"text":"I came here with my gf for dinner and left completely satisfied. The place was lively but we were still able to hear each other. Because we didn't have a reservation they sat us by the kitchen bar which ended up being the best seat of the place for two of us since we got to watch the chefs work. The service was great and the servers constantly checked up on us making sure we were okay. We ordered the Japanese Arancini, Teriyaki Bao Sliders, and Fire Cracker Oshisushi. They were all great in their own way and we were too full to order the desserts even though the matcha cheesecake with green tea ice cream sounded amazing."}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about Hapa through Instagram but I guess I should learn my lesson to not ever listen to instagram. We arrived yesterday around 7 and ordered the sushimori which was 25 for 8 pieces. The place was quite empty about 4 other couples by the patio with drinks and food already served we figured it would be suitable to have a quick bite. We ordered the hello kitty drink which came quite fast. However our sashimi literally took 20 mins to come which I couldn't understand because everyone else seemed to have been serves drinks and food and the whole bar was quite empty. We could not fathom why it took 20 minutes to slice up 8 pieces of sashimi. The drink was okay, you could barely taste any of the alcohol content which I'm not sure if that's good or bad. When the sashimi did come out I was highly disappointed as it claims omakase but I could not see anything particularly special about the selected items and could not justify the price vs the quality vs the wait time. Very disappointing... I can't imagine how much longer we would've waited if we had ordered more items."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed anything on Yelp but I had such a great time at this restaurant that I felt compelled to write.    VIbe:  I loved the vibe!  Classy, sexy friendly and professional.  As a new joint, this group is working hard to carve out a top-notch reputation.  Food:  Very well executed with flavour profiles that should please a broad audience.  Here's what the four in our party ordered: Halibut Taco - must try Beef Short Ribs - must try Ebi Mayo - if the batter can be a bit crisper it would be a must try Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps - must try Spicy Pork Ishi-yaki - must try Sockeye Salmon Sashimi - must try Chicken Karaage - again, needs to be crisper  Drinks:  You must order the Red Dragon shots!  The sake in the bamboo flasks is a cool presentation.  I just love the energy of Hapa...this place is my new favourite chillax-with-friends spot!"}
{"text":"loved the yvr location so my boyfriend and i decided to give this one a shot. the food was not as good. or maybe that had to do with the fact that a cockroach ran across my side plate near the end of our meal. we called over the bartender as we were seated at the bar and we managed to kill the roach with a menu. that was the end of our appetite. the barman was shocked and apologetic but only discounted us 10% off our bill. unacceptable. i understand this kind of stuff happens. it's the way it was handled that was disappointing. won't be going back - sadly."}
{"text":"This restaurant can be quickly summed up by:  1. Fancy interior, way too loud as if they were trying to be a trendy club. Don't bother trying to talk to your date or friends.   2. $11-$12 \"Crab Rolls\" had no discernible crab in them with tons of rice and a piece of asparagus (I think) stuck in the middle.   3. 6 Tako Yaki were actually THREE CUT IN HALF!   4. $11 noodle dish was almost as good as a $4 noodle dish from china town.   If you love fancy douche places with no substance, high prices, loud music so you can barely talk to your guests, and somewhat sub-standard service, this place is great.  Short review? Go to Guu. It's way better.  Note: the waitresses were actually very nice and tried to be helpful, but there didn't seem to be enough for everyone and we basically had to wave our hands for 5min just to get our bill... Oh, and had to wait 15min just for a refill of water too."}
{"text":"Good service but horrible food. Came here for summerlicious. The sunomono is doused in vinegar and unappealing, the tempura fish entree was decent, and the cheesecake was bitter and had a freezer burnt texture. Avoid."}
{"text":"Hapa Izakaya is the Japanese bar/lounge that stands on it's own. Comparable to the Moxies/Joeys of Izakaya's, based on the decor, theme of the restaurant, the friendliness and how the staff is engaging with customers.   If you haven't experienced an Izakaya before, this is a great place to start.  Feel free to explore the food menu and don't forget about their selection of sake and other spirits!! They have whats called Hapa Hour from 5pm(?) to 7pm, selected menu items for half the price!!!   Add this place to your restaurant rotation, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Walked into a nice décor, expecting to have a great dinner after a date. Place was fairly empty at 7pm, got seated right away near the back. Menu choices were adequate, included sashimi, rolls, hot and cold dishes to share. Very similar concept to GUU but quality of food is meh and not comparable.  Ordered 4 dishes: (1) scallop tartare: drenched in a wasabi tasting spiciness, not much other flavours to it... could barely taste the scallops. it wasn't anything special. (2) hanabi roll -  spicy tuna sushi roll: again, nothing special.. could get this at a regular jap restaurant for less. (3) lobster motoyaki -  baked lobster tail with small amount of lobster meat with cheese, a little too salty, and was quite similar to guu's baked oyster. (4) Gindara - baked sablefish: this was the best dish out of the four that we ordered... again, very similar to guu's black cod. The sauce was delicious and sweet, the fish could have been silkier and softer for that melt-in-your-mouth sensation. You're looking at an average of $10+ per dish. Came out to be about $50 for two. Wasn't completely full after dinner.. went for dessert.  Overall, don't think I'll be back again (not even for the eye candies ;))"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  I was excited to try this izakaya from Vancouver and was not disappointed! Even before setting foot in this place I liked it: great location (in Little Italy, steps from the Royal Cinema, and not in the Annex or Dundas/Bay area that is already over-saturated with izakaya/sushi/ramen restaurants) & they take reservations (although we got a table on Saturday night without a reso, but we got the last 2 seats at the bar). It's lively and there's yelling, but you can also have a conversation without losing your voice.   Drinks: I had to have the Hello Kitty:) It's a girly and sweet mix of strawberry puree, calpico, vodka, and soda. It was yummy!   Food: Highlights for me were the tuna avocado salsa dip (flavourful and fresh, comes with plantain chips which I loved) and Gindara (sablefish, recommended by our server -- very buttery and cooked perfectly). The halibut tacos were pretty tasty too - lots of flavours with the bacon bits, spicy tartar sauce, and veggies. They had some sushi specials and we tried the baja salmon roll. Pretty good! Edamame was okay. They use a kind of marinade instead of the usual salt sprinkled on top. The Kinoko Ishi-Yaki was not too remarkable. A bunch of rice and mushrooms on a hot stone bowl -- not much flavour, kind of like a sad dolsot bibimbap.   I would come back to try more of the menu and their cocktails! Prices are reasonable, service was friendly (the bartender even gave us free samples of their strawberry lemonade slushy cocktail), and the ambiance is perfect for a low-key night."}
{"text":"I had the GREATEST experience here!!  can I seriously end up living in hapa Izakaya in my next life?! Hahaha.  I always enjoy talking to strangers and actually like sitting at the bar (esp. since it was just the bf and me), so imagine my delight when the hostess said there was only bar seating available!!  I was torn between sitting by the kitchen (I love watching food network - it's kind of like that, right?!) or the bar (I also love people watching and talking to strangers/bartenders), but the bartender Mackenzie (sp?) made my decision easy with his high energy.  So.. it was off to the bar we went!  Drinks we tried: - Hello Kitty: Due to some bad experiences w/former roommates, I hate HK.  In fact, I hate her so much, I'll go out of my way to NOT order something with her name on it.  Weird, I know.  Anyways, the bartender said that HK was their signature drink.  He said I'd like it if I like sweet & fruity...and he was right.  It was so yummy.  i can't even explain it, but order it.  And I actually don't order the same drink twice in one night (at restaurants, at least, haha), but I ordered a second HK.  It was that good. - Shiso Mojito: another good drink.  It was cool watching Mackenzie make the mojito by smashing the leaves with his hands (another reason you should sit at the bar!!!), but the drink itself was good. - Yuzu slush: something I wouldn't normally try myself, but after doing so, I'd come back here and order this again.  It's the perfect refreshing drink for a warm summer day..seriously. - Strawberry sake lemonade: DELICIOUS.  I want more.  Food we tried: - Beef tataki: yum..geez, it was so good, I can't even remember what I liked about it.  The beef was sliced reeeeally thinly (I hate when places slice the beef too thick -_-). - Ebi mayo: think of the prawns in walnut prawns.  Except with a little kick.  And taken to the next level bc they're crunchier and yummier. - Karaage: I didn't have any problems w/the crispiness..maybe all the kinks have been worked out?  The pieces were huge (think: size of a shrimp ball at dim sum), the chicken was juicy & tender, and it was so crunchy and delicious!  I would most DEFINITELY order everything again.  Except next time, I'm not gonna be an idiot and pre-eat like I did this time.  i want to try more food!  I love the food, I love the service and energy, and everyone there is so freaking ATTRACTIVE and NICE!  Tips for yelpers:  1. If you come here before 8pm, there is little to no wait.  If you come after 8pm, there will be a wait.  I'm not saying this place is reservations only, but I only observed 3 other parties who did not have a reservation. 2. Sit at the bar if possible.  There are 2 to choose from: kitchen or actual alcohol bar.  Talk to the waitresses/bartenders/hostesses and get their recommendations.  I'm glad we did. :)"}
{"text":"Great venue and service. Mckenzie. And his team were attentive and quick g that it was a busy night. Can't wait to come back and try the full menu. Always love the option of having Sapporo on tap! Their drinks list is not a bad list, not too many sweet drinks which I like.   I attended and evening which there was spoken word, a band and great people enjoying themselves. I can not wait for the next Thursday like this! A definite must to add to your repitoire of places to check out."}
{"text":"Can't say much about this place in terms of a full blown meal. What I can say is my experience was positive. I had only drinks & a tapas. My drink was the Apple Cider WAY too sweet for my taste but that has zero to do with the restaurant.   My Tapas was the Teriyaki Bao Sliders. They were delicious!! Very tender meat with a kick from Karashi Mayo...just delicious. I would like to do this over again but with a sit down service. From the food alone this is a 4*."}
{"text":"Go to Guu.  This place is like the popular kid's table where all the staffs are super gorgeous. The staff is friendly and the food is alright but the price is slightly steeper than Guu. I've waited I believe over 2 hours before for Guu and I think it's totally worth it. I think I waited for slightly less than an hour here and I can't say it's worth the wait. There's nothing wrong with this restaurant but I wouldn't go back because I prefer the warm, welcoming feeling of Guu more. Perhaps it's unfair to compare this restaurant to Guu but with such similar food, it's difficult not to. However, I do give this restaurant 4 stars since I shouldn't base a restaurant on just their price and atmosphere since their food and service was decent."}
{"text":"I literally went to this location three times when I was in Toronto.   And yes, I was accompanied by a hapa, so I was ok.   They literally have the most beautiful waitstaff in the world here, and yes, they're all hapa. This seems to be family run, and though its relatively new, it's been hopping and packed everytime I've gone back. I wish LA had a place like this..... sigh.   They have bar food items, and weekly specials here. Though it's a little on the pricier side you're paying for the quality and ambience. Highlights the chicken karaage, OMG, i don't eat fried things, but this, THIS i eat. the tuna belly- delicious. The hot bowl of rice and mixed goodies were also nomnoms, and if you're into specialty drinks-- look out for those. I saw the table next to me get some yuzu slushy, and I was so tempted to take a swipe. :)   I didn't like their noodles, it was a bit overcooked, the seafood fare (like their tacos), and tartare and chips, heaveneeeeely. All in all, a fantastic place to get together with some friends, with noms the night away. Order a bunch of food and share!"}
{"text":"Solid food. Bad service. I don't normally complain about service as I'm never in a rush and pretty patient...but these waitresses are either understaffed or unable to do more than one thing at a time. Took 20 mins to get our bill and another 20 for her to come back so we could pay. Ordered edamame right when we got there and they took about 30 mins to come out. Had to flag her down to take our order too. Halibut fish tacos and kimchi rice bowl were really good. Meat balls were good. Bao buns were just burgers. Maybe I didn't read the menu right, but I was expecting a steamed bun. Noodles were likely the weakest dish.  A lot of comparisons to Guu here. I prefer Guu based on both food and service."}
{"text":"it could be better! atmosphere was very bar like, dim with awesome decor. however, we went on a friday night and wasn't that busy. 1/3 full which kinda or could ruin the atmosphere. we used a groupon, which didn't indicate any restrictions except require reservations. they said in-house weekdays only BUT were awesome enough to let us use it still! as for food, delicious!! but for the price vs. taste, not all worth it...i would stick to Guu."}
{"text":"Hands down better than Hapa in Vancouver. Amazing Japanese fusion food in a trendy Toronto neighborhood. I highly recommend it. Food is super tasty, drinks are excellent, service is fabulous and the ambiance is great. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Came here after looking at the reviews and pictures online. The restaurant is pretty big, they had both indoor and outdoor seating available. The decor and ambience was pretty nice.  They had an open kitchen concept where you can see the chefs prepare the food.   It was a Saturday night at around 6pm, the restaurant was empty, we were the only ones here. They had about 3-4 kitchen staff, and two waitresses but the service was really slow. The waitresses were just chilling around and talking to each other. We had a difficult time calling for a waiter to place our order.   We order: Beef Tataki, Karaage, Chicken Wings, Lobster Pressed sushi (oshizushi), Shrimp Pressed Sushi (Oshizushi), Fire Cracker Pressed Sushi, Kobe Wagyu Pressed Sushi  Beef Tataki, average, nothing too special   Karaage was crispy but a little bland  Chicken Wings, were delicious  Lobster Pressed sushi, was one of the main reasons why we chose to eat here as it was something unique that other stores did not offer. We were really excited to try it but it was not good. The sushi was really bland and the lobster is pretty tasteless. There was very little sauce. I would not consider this oshizushi, more like lobster niguri. It was pretty much just plain rice in the shape of a rectangle, topped with lobster. Similar to the lobster, the shrimp oshizushi wasn't good. It didn't have the special flavourful taste that most oshizushi have. Hapa's Oshizushi is not anywhere comparable to JaBistro or Miku.   Fire cracker pressed sushi (Oshizushi), it was seared in front of us. Wasn't that good, still very bland if you eat it without soy sauce. We did not finish it.   Wagyu Pressed Sushi (Oshizushi) , it was simliar to the rest of the food. Very Bland. Most places top this type of sushi with a sauce but there was non in this case. Must be eaten with soy sauce. It was cool how they torch it in front of you though.  However, their portions are bigger than Miku and JaBistro. The order came with 10 pieces whereas, the other places come with 6.   Overall, i did not like the place. It was very pricey for bad food and bad service."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 star. The interior is nice, service is friendly, food is decent. Location is ideal too.  At the end of the day, it's an easy spot to catch up with friends and have a fun night, without the traditional 'loudness' of a normal Izakaya experience."}
{"text":"The food at Hapa is just normal food that you can expect from a regular izakaya. Nothing really surprisingly good.  The waitress was attentive but the host was BAD.  We arrived at 5:20pm and was allowed in the door but wasn't greeted or seated. We were just ignored and after a while was told that they open at 5:30. Nothing being said, nobody offer us to at least take a look at the menu first, or seat, or a glass of water. They left us standing there to watch them cheer for the opening.  Okay, we are now being seated, and the host said  \"can you finish in 2 hours, we need the tables for customers who made reservations\"  it's understandable but there were only 2 tables at the time...and by the time is 7:00pm and when we were ready to leave, the restaurant is not even 1/3 full...so much for rushing us..  Anyways, with the mediocre food and the bad experience, i'm not going back again."}
{"text":"First summerlicious of the year! Great start we had the uni and the ceviche both looked and tasted fantastic, had the rice bowl and the halibut the rice was fantastic while the halibut is ok, nothing too special. Desserts were the least of my favourite brulee was watery, while the apple gyoza was ok. Gyoza was served wiith ice cream which was so good!! Was a black sesame ice cream home made and ofcourse it wasnt black! Delicious   Great place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent experience here. Went here on Friday night and the food was wonderful.  We had a self-made sampling of about 8 dishes and the only one I did not love was the kimchi udon which seemed a bit like Korean Fettuccini Alfredo. Didn't love it. We did however love the Japple Pie. You have to try it. It is most excellent. Definitely encourage you to try this."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious for. 4:45pm reservation. We had chose to come here after planning to visit another summerlicious restaurant. The resto looks really nice from the outside. The garage door was open which gives that street feel. We arrived to the resto where the resto was empty with customers. Given the time of the day, im sure they were prepping for dinner. We advise we had a reservation for summerlicious but we didn't get the summerlicious menu. Te staff was okay. Not exactly what I expected for a modern Jap resto where I expected a more friendly approach. The staff seemed to be consumed in their own affairs on the dining floor and the waitress didn't feel as warm as they could be. I sense socializing vs attending to your customers even if it's 2 tables.   The food was fair. We order the pre-fix and I could say the portions of the main are average. Certainly not the most generous. The sashimi salad was strange. The fish didn't seem fresh and the presentation wasn't what I expected. I also thought the I was tasting soap in the greens. One of the mains was good, the rice bowl. The stone pot really created that twist of good food. The ingredients inside the rice bowl was interesting as I was expecting more veggies. The dessert was okay. The cheesecake was good but a bit too sweet.   Ordered a sangria where it was nothing special.   Overall, not dying to go back to this location."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this restaurant in years as I moved out of the area, and decided to venture back last night for a low key bday dinner. Boy am I happy I did because they're just as good as I remembered! Happy they took reservations as most places these days don't for some ridiculous reason. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a lovely friendly lady who seated us in a great table by the window. The restaurant/bar is a great open space so that you don't feel like you're sitting on the people beside you, which also seems to be the trend today...already loving this place! The food was great as I remembered and really nicely presented. There was plenty of food, and everything was fresh, and tasty. I especially love the tuna avocado served with plantain chips. Really nice and simple, yet fresh and full of complimentary creative flavors. They even came over with some sesame ice cream and drink as I bday surprise from the restaurant. It was perfect, and just the right kind of experience for any age or food preference - this is a great place for a simple night out whether just for snacks or drinks. Great dive bar/resto for even the pickiest eaters!"}
{"text":"Say no to summerlicious menu!  My friends and I came here for the summerlicious menus and we were all disappointed. I was a frequent patron of the Happa chain in Vancouver because the food was delicious but it's a completely different story here.   My husband's ebi mayo was just battered shrimp dipped in sweet chilli sauce. Where's the mayo? My sashimi salads was really salty with not so fresh salmon pieces. All of our steaks came luke warm with a few deep fried potatoes on the side. Didn't look too appetizing nor appealing.  To finish, none of us liked our sesame cheesecake. Maybe we aren't aware of how Japanese cheesecake should taste like but it was quite grainy with only a slight hint of black sesame.   Aside from the mediocre taste of the food, the service was top notch. Our server took down our names and address us by our names through out the name. I thought that was a nice added personal touch so 1 extra star for good service."}
{"text":"Hapa was one of the first (and best) izakayas I grew up frequenting in Vancouver, so imagine my excitement when I found out that they were coming to Toronto!   Perhaps I expected too much too early, as I went as soon as they opened and encountered a few minor glitches. First of all, their website was outdated. The link that allows you to make reservations online did not even mention the Toronto location. There was also no phone number to be found on the world wide web. When we decided to beat the crowds and arrive early on a Friday night, it looked like the staff were still being rallied. We were told to come back in 15 minutes. Almost 45 minutes (over drinks next door at Cafe Dip) later, we returned to find the restaurant not all that filled, but mostly reserved for large parties.  After promising that we would get out in time for the group (who was expected in 3 hours), we finally sat down to a shiny new menu book, but no handwritten \"fresh sheet\" of daily specials. Regardless, we were starving at this point and were more than ready to knock back some hot sake and assortment of dishes.  Over all, the dishes were all very tasty, but also a bit smaller than expected. Having the edamame marinated was refreshing. Spreading negitoro on garlic bread made it extra rich. The kinoko ishi-yaki, a mixed mushroom rice dish, which despite being flavourful, failed horribly at crusting up alongside the hot stone bowl as promised. The galbi were impossibly thin and a bit too fatty. The gindara was similarly tasty, but miniature. Surprisingly, the tempura gyoza was fantastic.  The entirely young, Asian, black clad servers are friendly, but mostly seem very green. The familiar face and experienced hand of the Vancouver management makes a big difference to the guest experience at a time when this new location is still obviously ironing out its kinks."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the hottest humpday in the history of Sara K.P's existence.  Why you ask?  Because that's the day we had the infamous Hapa Omakase which is 11 courses of delectable Izakaya style food courtesy of Edwin's \"Whatsa Hapa 'nin\" UYE.  For a second when I walked into Hapa's (after much ballyhoo'd greeting from the friendly staff)  it felt like I'd mistakingly walked into a financial district bar as there were guys dressed in their spiffy Brooks Brothers, but then I realized it was actually Edwin & Elvis wearing suits!!!  One other guy was even dressed up like a eunuch with gaudy bejazzled shoes wtf???  My Hapa debauchery began with Hello Kitty cocktails which was Vodka with strawberry and \"Calpis\" (it's not what you think, Calpis is a Japanese soft drink  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpis)  This cocktail was a perfect mix of sweet and sour fruity pink vodka'd yumminess, what Hello Kitty, would probably taste like?  The girls who work here are cute and pretty and were en-point with friendly and expedient service, but there was no Asian posing http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_fine_art_of_asian_posing on their part  :(  but enough about pretty posing and on to the food.  I'll divide by courses and the grading system (using my celeb crushes/nightmares as a measure of hotness/un-hotness) is as follows:  5-stars = David Beckham  = Mouthgasm!! 4-stars = Tom Hardy  = I'm drooling a lot!! 3-stars = Joseph Gordon-Levitt = Just right ;) 2-stars = Charlie Sheen = Dry mouth :( 1-star = Carrot Top...Blegh! = Gagging!!!   1)   Edamame, chilled and nicely marinated, but sparse =Charlie Sheen  2)  Avocado Salad w. Plaintain Chips - I could eat this all day!!  Amazing salad with tiny diced veg seasoned with sesame oil with deep fried plaintain chips for dipping, a little sparse in quantity but i'll give it a DAVID BECKHAM  3)  Beef Tataki - I didn't have this but noticed hubby and company devoured this with zeal, so I'm guessing it earns a Tom Hardy?   4) Ebi Mayo - Fricaseed shrimp in spicy mayo Eff yeah= Tom Hardy  5) Beef Short Ribs - Did not eat myelf, but they looked like really thin/small kalbi.  Hubby kept shoving them in his mouth so they must have been good so they earn a Joseph Gordon-Levitt   6) Negitoro - Chopped Albacore tuna belly, spring onions and  toasted garlic bread I didn't eat, but hubby said it was cool, so again it's a Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  7) Renkon Gyoza Tempura - Argh, I don't eat pork , but accidentally ate one :( If I can pretend it was filled with veggies I'll give this one a Tom Hardy.  8) Halibut Tacos = OMG DAVID BECKHAM soooo Yummy!!!  9)  Ishi-Yaki- Like Bibimpap (raw pork/ egg in hot stone bowl) Didn't eat this myself but this entree earns a Joseph Gordon Levitt (*sigh*delightful)  from hubby   10)Chicken Kara-age (even better than mom's!! shhhhh)= Tom Hardy yum, yum  11)Yaki Udon - Thick noodles w. stir-fried chicken & veggies good sized portion, little salty =Charlie Sheen  Everything I had for the most part was wonderfully crispy and fried to perfection, with plenty of flavour and bite that left me wanting more.  If there's any criticism it would be that the portions for some of the dishes (like Ebi mayo, only 6 shrimp between 4 peeps?) are miniature and not enough for 4 people maybe better suited to 3?  Good to know: Just be careful on the way to the washrooms as there's a dip in the floor on the way there, then upon entering the stalls the floor is raised, so watch out!!  I tripped and almost fell hat-first into the toilet Lol!  Also if you are going to try the Omakase menu, be sure to know that there is an 18% gratuity added, plus taxes which will sky rocket the bill especially when you add 3 beers to the mix!!  Special thank-you to Susan G and Dishan W and Tony F for weathering hubby's endless drivel about obscure Sci-fi films and Amsterdam politiking...he doesn't get out much so once he starts to talk, it's like bloodletting Lol! Gotta luv him :)  Edwin, thank-you so, so much for organizing this outstanding UYE at Hapa's, my tastebuds are doing the \"Gangnam style\" and \"Asian Poses\"  they're just that HAPA-ey!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and loved it! The interior looks beautiful and they're always playing anime haha! It is a lot more lively after 10 pm when they have the live DJ, however it gets very loud! It's hard to have a conversation with the person sitting beside you sometimes.   The servers are very nice and attentive every time that I've came, so that's a big plus! A major perk at Hapa is that they do separate bills - no matter how large your group is. I've been to a birthday party of 20 and 30, both times settling the separate bills was super easy.   Their food is really good, however you don't get much for the price you pay. Presentation is also beautiful - they will finish off the pressed sushi in front of you with the lighters! Amazing idea for a snap haha :P I also ordered the pork belly lettuce wraps and Karaage, both were good but again not really filling!   My favourite dish here which is not only delicious, but perfect portions for $11 is the Yaki Udon noodles! I'm a udon noodle fanatic so I'm super picky, but the udon here is sooo creamy and chewy. Perfect amount of meat too! I was really looking forward to order two of this for my birthday dinner recently but sadly they switched it out for ravioli :( was super disappointed !!! I hope they bring it back because they have one of the best udon noodles I've ever had!   I usually don't write a review on drinks from anywhere, but I recommend the Red Dragon Shot! I believe on Saturdays you can order 4 of this for only $20. If I remember correctly, it has barcardi 151, sourpuss raspberry and there's something else I think that I totally forgot. I know it sounds bad since there's 151 in it but trust me it's soooo good!! You have to try it to believe it!   Anyway, I recommend this place if you are downtown and looking for a good Izakaya! I would not come here if I'm starving though, unless I'm planning on spending a lot LOL"}
{"text":"Great chill atmosphere.  Staff includes owners (family) that treat you really well.  Drinks phenomenal, music great and just the right volume.  Food, superb.  I will go back for sure.  Way to go."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service EVER, even the food couldn't make up for it - not that it was good to begin with,  Let's talk about the food first. Came here for Summerlicious and I ordered the Japanese Arancini, but they were sold out so I settled for the Endive and Gorgonzola salad - it was a pretty average salad, I actually forgot there was any mushroom in it until I saw a piece while eating. For the main I got the Grilled Lamb Chops which came with instant mashed potatoes. Yes. INSTANT mashed potatoes - it stuck together and was gummy, I could lift the whole clump up with my chopsticks (I bet you're wondering WHY I'm eating mashed potatoes with chopsticks, keep reading my friend). The Matcha Creme Brulee was watery and had curds - which happens when the cream is too hot when the egg is incorporated.   The service was absolutely horrible. The only way we made it through the dinner was because another waitress, Celina, was attentive to our table, meanwhile our waitress, Yicong,  barely gave us any service. She didn't give my friend a water, she didn't give me a fork and knife for my lamb chop (hence why i was using chopsticks), she didn't give us our dessert, she didn't check up on us. she pretty much neglected us the whole dinner. I observed her waiting other nearby tables perfectly fine.  Lena was the one who got us a jug of water, brought out our food and got us our dessert (I had to ask for the dessert since Yicong wasn't nearby), while waiting other tables as well.  When we finished our dessert, Yicong came to clear our tables and asked \"Did you guys already ask someone for the bill?\" No, we're asking you because you're our server.   If only we had Celina, it would have been just the instant mashed potatoes and watery creme brulee that ruined the night.   We, are never, ever, ever, coming back to Hapa."}
{"text":"Happy day at the dark and trendy Hapa Izakaya. Volcano rolls, house sake and lots of tapas. This place is decent. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"This review is only for the drinks! I had the Hello Kitty and the Harujuku Girl! Both were so yummy, girly, sweet and sugary! Hello Kitty was fruity and Harujuku tasted like cream soda. Both were around $9 each? i dont remember but they were YUMMY.Dessert drinks for sure... My boyfriend wasnt really feeling the drink selection because he's a beer guy... And there wasn't much variety of beer :(( the restaurant itself is super dim, modern and spacious. A lot different from the typical Japanese izakaya joints in downtown Toronto. Service is super friendly and the staff are super attractive. Coming back to try the food next time!"}
{"text":"I am confused! How many stars is Hapa Izakaya? How many stars should I give in order to be fair?  5 Star and up - Edwin's UYE and all these wonderful people sharing some good times together   3.5 Star - great drink menu and love all those Japanese cocktails options which are quite unique, but the mixed drinks definitely on the weak side   4 Star - for services and friendliness of the staffs and waitress wearing great outfits according to the male yelpers  4 Star - for the set up of the space, good enough lighting when you want to take a good photo! :)  But the food... the Omakase ($29/pp)Tasting Menu... was a little letdown. Nothing really wow me or too memorable.  As stated for the Omakase is for 4 to share and have 11 courses... I am ok with sharing and I love sharing.. But curiously a lot of the dishes are not really portioned for 4 people!! How can I divide 6 pieces of Shrimp or Fried Chicken or Tuna Sashimi between 4... Especially when you are sharing with dinner mates that always looking at you with hungry eyes and kept saying \"hungry\".  1)  Edamame - A-OK nicely marinated, but a small bowl for 4 to share?!   2)  Tuna Avocado Salad with Plantain Chips - A-OK   3)  Beef Tataki - Nicely seared went well with the sauce  4) Tuna Sashimi - 6 good pieces but for 4 of us... we are fighting for the last 2 pieces!  5) Ebi Mayo - 6 shrimps.. tasty, we are fighting for the extra pieces  6) Beef Short Ribs - Savory and quite tender.. good portion  7) Negitoro - Chopped Albacore tuna belly, spring onions and  toasted garlic bread, size of a meatball... ended up we had a teaspoonful each. A waste of Negitoro, too mushy, too saucy...   8) Renkon Gyoza Tempura - A-OK! Light batter result in a really light and dedicate taste.. but 6 pieces again?!           9) Halibut Tacos - Asian fusion tacos so tasty... with a kick of spice too! One of the best dish for the night  10)  Ishi-Yaki (raw pork/ egg in hot stone bowl) - The hot bowl need to be more sizzling..the rice never got crispy and it is just kind of mushy and wet  11) Chicken Kara-age- 6 pieces again?! Great fried chicken... we are fighting for the last 2 with our chopsticks!   12) Yaki Udon - definitely is a meh, the chicken pieces inside looks like leftover scrap and I can stir fried a better version! Salty is all I remembered!   I feel a little incomplete after the 12 dishes.. No I am not hungry but I think if they going to have it as tasting menu, the last item should be some sweet.   If you have picky eater/special diet requirements, I definitely recommend just order dishes off the menu. More flexibility and not every single item on the tasting menu might be appealing for you.  I am glad that able to sample the tasting menu and got to try a lot of the dishes on Hapa's. Since it is relatively new, hopefully down the road there will be some daily fresh items and the tasting menu can incorporate the special of the day too.  I definitely will be back here for a drink or 2!  3.5 star with room for improvement!"}
{"text":"There are multiple reasons why I wouldn't go back, from inedible food to slow, scattered service. Focusing primarily on the food, we had ordered a variety of dishes. The Edamame is on the menu as having been 'marinated' so it wasn't a surprise that they didn't come out looking the bright green steamy way we're used to - however the dark camouflage green made them incredible unappetizing. From what I can tell the marinade is soy sauce, and they probably sit in a fridge in it all day. We also ordered the kimchi and I can normally power through the most pungent of fermentations, but this was far too salty, and I the additions of sesame and (what I believe was) dried wakame only confused the dish. We also ate the Kaarage (standard, relatively bland), the Kobe Meatballs (all except one had gristle in it), and the Okonomiyaki which, while beautiful, was nothing but mush. The flavours were completely indistinguishable. We were left being the kind of dinners who just push food around to make it seem as if we ate more than we did, to avoid being rude.   My review lies on the other end of the spectrum from the other yelpers, it seems, but there are too many brilliant restaurants in this College street district to spend another night pushing food around my plate."}
{"text":"Good:  Pork belly lettuce wraps (great meat, love the red sauce) Tako yaki (amazing all around) Beef short ribs (not chewy and very tasty and large portions)  Okay: Saba (a slightly fishy taste but nicely made) Halibut tacos (didn't really taste the fish but the sauce is great) Tuna avocado salsa dip (didn't really taste the tuna but decent tasting. Tiny portions though)  Bad: Kinoko ishiyaki (waaaay too salty) Happa wings (Basically fried wings with spice and some bland dip. 6 wings for like $8, really?)   Now onto the less important details. The service was very fast... food came out very quickly and in a constant stream even though the restaurant was quite full. The staff don't have as much energy as those at Guu but they're decent enough. The prices are quite high considering how small the dishes are though. Be prepared to spend a lot of money for very little food. You're going to have a bad time if you pick the wrong dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a date, we both were meh about the whole experience: Lets start Bad to Good:   Candie Salmon : Way too Salty! Also didn't use the best type of rice (Good Japanese rice shouldn't be like glue). The salmon on top didn't taste great at all. Couldn't finish it.  Fish Tacos : This is tough cause Toronto is filled with pretty good mexican joints now, so this doesn't even compete. Just feels like a watered down/safe version of what good fish tacos should be. Really lacks that kick.   Beef Ribs:  Flavor is pretty good, but pricey for the amount of you get. Meat was really thin.   Teriyaki Sliders: Delicious! The meat had lots of great flavor, plus very moist. The bao complimented the meat well. Very good use of wasabi sauce. Worth the price!   Service was awesome. Staff although super busy, was very helpful and friendly! We enjoyed the ambiance, was happy to see some t.v's in the Bar area.   Overall found that the food quality and amount, wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"A first we were surprised about how empty this place was on a Saturday evening. We were the only customers. The place is huge, they have a patio that open during summer.   But the food is not that great. I see thats why theres no one here. Most of the food is either average or even below average...  We purposely came here after seeing the press sushi they offered. They had Lobster pressed sushi which is unique compared to other restaurants. This is one of the first place that offered this, but it was a great disappointment. There was barely any lobster taste to it, the sushi was bland. It just tasted like rice. The shrimp pressed sushi was the same, you mostly taste the rice. Nothing compared to the ones at miku though the portions are a little bigger for the price. The Beef tataki was ok, the chicken wings were good but the karaage was very bland. It had no flavour.   As for the service, it was horrible. The waiter is nonexistent and we were the only ones there...  This place is probably better for chilling rather than dinner. The food is not good but the offer lots of different alcohol. Overall though, not worth the price you are paying. Overpriced for bad food and service. The food is incomparable to other restaurants that charge these prices. I do not know how this restaurant has a 3.5 star on yelp."}
{"text":"Not the best izakaya, service is nice but the food is just ok. A good place to chill and have a beer though"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 Stars because service and atmosphere was a 4 but food was a 3. Note that they serve ocean wise fish = sustainable fish = must support! Elaboration below. I've been following them on Instagram for awhile and finally went with a friend visiting from out of town who wanted \"sushi\" but doesn't eat raw fish. It was a Friday at 7.30pm when we called to make reservations for 8pm and they took us no problem. We realized later that the place gets busy probably after 9 or 10pm and when it does it's totally happening with super fun 90s pop/hip hop music and although it's arranged more like a restaurant ppl couldn't help but dance (but note that this is when you can't really hear your friend across the table anymore.) what struck me the most was the hospitality. The service providers were so nice I was honestly pleasantly surprised. Our server was so friendly and helpful with the menu and made jokes with us and then the manager came by and wanted to make sure everything was ok and was also super courteous and nice. At one point, hilarious story, my friend recognized a guy from work from awhile back and so he came over to chat for a bit before he went to his own table. Our amazing server came by to ask \"do you know him? Is he bothering you?\" And I thought that was so good of her to just come check in because you never know! For two girls we ordered too much food. 4 dishes two of which were rice was too much. The tacos were amazing, the cheese balls (forgot name) were ok but my friend loved it, the fire something sushi tasted good but i wished the ratio of sushi to rice were better but the fire they brought was fun. And we for the hot stone bowl the pork and it was ok not the best but I would've eaten the entire thing. My friend also got wings and she seemed to enjoy it but i was suffering trying to finish the other dishes due to being so full so didn't even try. So come for the fun vibes and good people and be ok with pretty good but not excellent food. Would come back :-)"}
{"text":"Visited Hapa Izakaya for the first time last night for a birthday dinner. I knew before going in that their tapa's would be expensive. I found it overpriced for the quantity you get.  I started off with their Hello Kitty drink ($12) and he shared a Sapporo tower ($28). I was disappointed in the Hello Kitty drink as it tasted like medicine.  We shared the pork belly lettuce wraps ($11), wings ($9), and the sushi bites ($16). The food came out very quickly. The wings were small and were just fried. The sauce that came with the wings made it taste more delicious. For $9 for small wings wasn't worth it. I could get a pound of wings for a larger size for the same approximate price. The pork belly lettuce wraps were decent. The sushi bites didn't actually taste like dynamite as it was described on their menu. I thought the wasabi was a bit overpowering when I ate it.  I see Hapa Izakaya as a place more to get drinks and maybe have a few tapa's on the side. If you're hungry I wouldn't recommend going here for a full meal because you'll have to spend a lot."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a taste, loved what we had. Nice ambiance, we sat by the window to watch College St life go by. Nice but limited beer selection, some local, some craft. The agadashi tofu was wonderful, served in a smoking hot granite bowl. Delicious."}
{"text":"Sorry gang for the late review on this... Thank you Edwin for the UYE!!!! AMAZING JOB. Thank you so much for following up with each and every one, and being the legendary photographer as always.  Alright... my review..  That night, we ordered the 11-course meal for $29. Turns out, the meal was shared with four people so we each had one bite of each dish. In the end, surprisingly it was quite filling. For the bigger macho men though, this wasn't filling...  The edamame was extremely delicious, that was my favorite. I probably ate most of the share. Tony F was a witness.  The tuna taco? Amazing!!!! It wouldn't be something I'd ever order at a Japanese restaurant, but I'm so glad it was a part of the course. It was soooo goood, I don't even know what's in it (well,.. tuna). It's like a perfect combo in a bunch.  The dishes came quick. Having to serve such a large Yelp party, I think they did a great job. Of course until the end when we wanted separate bills... about 30 minutes sorting that out.  I had the meal with a cocktail called Hello Kitty $7.50: A sweet mix of strawberry purée, Calpico and Absolut vodka, topped with soda. A Hapa classic  Real sweet and yummy, cannot taste the alcohol at all. Meal + drink, about $50 per person. There was a service charge of 15% or so for 30+ party.  Great UYE!!!! Also love that we were in TWO separate areas and they still served us pretty well.  I miss the edamame, it's def my favourite out of all the Toronto restaurants!"}
{"text":"Live music and a chill place to come and drink and eat:)!ask for Celina she was an amazing server!!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way here to partake in Thu's big bday bash here and I was pretty impressed with the experience overall. They managed to serve all 40 of us at a good pace and with plenty of food to go around for everyone. We did they 11-course set meal, which is a great way to have a taste of everything. Now that I've tried them, I'll know what to order next time I come back!  Dishes I liked:  Tuna avocado dip Negitoro Tuna carpaccio  Pass: Karaage - I usually don't mind eating this at most Chinese cafe/bubbletea stores, but this one had a flavour I can only describe as strange....   I was really too full by the time they served the rice and noodle dishes but I'm glad they served them all at the end instead of trying to fill us up on carbs.  The bamboo sake serving set is a cute touch and there are plenty of servings in one of those pitchers!"}
