{"text":"Great pizza and wing spot ! Mr and my wife have loved this place for year since 2002 ! I remember when old man Dave  from majestic owned Tha business ! Sorry to see they closed"}
{"text":"Awesome subs. They are huge, definitely get your monies worth. One day will try the pizza. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizza places ever! Everything is super cheap but totally delicious. I would recommend and i would come back again!"}
{"text":"We found this place off of Groupon...we shop at Pets mart all the time and never bothered looking around to see what was here.  The Groupon was for their 28\" cheese pie so the family packed up and made the trek over to give it a shot...we were happy we did.  I made the mistake of asking for it well done because it is a rather thin crusted pie and it was a little too much.  With that being said it was a good tasting pie and we will be back.  We want to try a standard pie and the toppings so we look forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Updated review....Just tried getting our second order through groupon.  Found out they were out of mushrooms!  A pizza joint OUT of mushrooms!! Ugh...needless to say..I doubt we will even use our second groupon.  What a waste...definitely will complain to groupon.

First review....Not sure how this is getting such a high rating.  Went in with a groupon for our first time trying this place.  Ordered a pizza with sausage and shroom...and one with pepperoni and olive.  Brought our pizzas home...found out they forgot olives.  We didn't feel like driving all the way back....so we just ate the plain pepperoni.  The pizza was overcooked...and the crust was so tough.  It was like eating jerkey.  We will give it another try..since we have the remaining groupon..hopefully it'll be better."}
{"text":"The inside could use TLC but I don't go somewhere to make out with the floor, so who cares. Ordered a vegetarian cold sub and I literally thought it was two sandwiches when I received it; it was freaking huge. But I ate it all and regretted.. somethings."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, glorious fries and huge tasty subs!! And EVERYTHING at LOW PRICES!!  If you even like pizza this will be your new spot! Customer service is phenomenal!  Thanks again Robert for taking such great care of us!  Be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Wow the guy is so rude!!!!!! 
I came in a saw a sign for 2 slice pizza for 5.25 and I was amaze at how cheap it was! So I ordered 2 slice and added toppings for 25 cents each. Then he said my total was 11.50 and I was like I thought it was 5.25 for 2 slice? He said no... And then say \"whatever just give me 10.50\" I'm like excuse me I want to understand before I pay for it and he said no it's 5.25 each! I'm like then I just want one slice. He said again \"just give me 10.50\" and I said 1 slice only! 

As for the pizza itself it's not even that special. This is not even New York style pizza.

Will not come back again. Rude service and complicated menu."}
{"text":"Dump with the best food!  No frills,just good grub. Pizzas are great,and the sandwiches are so large it takes one hungry dud to finish it. Give it a try. Get over the decor, and you'll fall in love with this place."}
{"text":"There's nothing. Like NY pizza and Angie's is spot on feeding my craving perfect crust, sauce & cheese so good i got a large and nearly ate the whole pie"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Love the thin crispy crust. Really tasty wings, good sized too (not small like some places). Can't wait to try the subs."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed I love this place, great pizza but today I went and arrived at 11:20...the hours on the door said they opened at 11. The doors were locked and no one was inside. I was looking forward to their pizza all week."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise, the decoration, the service, the food, and the price was all great. I'll be visiting this joint again"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Angie's and Jimmies.  I'm glad I found this new location.  I had a sub for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The subs will definitely feed two people as they are stacked high with meat and cheese.  The pizza and wings are also excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ! I usually go to the Indian School location but they are in the process of moving to 35th and Camelback. The Indian School location and the Bell location are the same as in good customer service and bomb food! Love Angies and Jimmies"}
{"text":"So, being the pizza aficionado that I am, I am always on the lookout for a new place I haven't tried out yet.  I work with some awesome people, and one of the ladies, Kelly, was telling me about this pizza joint that recently opened here on Bell.  She is an long time resident of Phoenix, and she was telling me that she used to go to the other location (Camelback) all the time.  I was headed out to lunch the other day and didn't know where I was headed (I don't recommend doing this because you spend time driving around undecided and wind up at some place shitty like Jack in the Box or something similar...lol!).  I started to drive Westbound down Bell and decided to head on over here to finally try this place out.  I called my order in for a small cheese pizza.  The guy told me it would be about 20 minutes, and I was on my way.  Went inside, waited about 5 minutes for my pizza to finish cooking, paid him my $8.00 and was on my way.  Here is how it was............

Small Cheese Pizza-  This pizza looked pretty good, but right away I could tell it was greasy as a mofo!  I could see the sheen on top of the cheese and even a little pocket of oil on the box in the corner.  I was a bit bummed out, but hoped for the best.  I left the lid off my pizza box on the way back to work to let it cool down a bit so I could devour it once I parked.  I tore off a piece and bit in.  First impression is that the cheese was a little lesser quality than what I prefer.  It was kind of \"loose\" and didn't meld all as one.  Maybe it was the cut/shred of the cheese?  Or maybe it was the quality of it.  Budget cheese usually is greasy as hell.  That was definitely the case here.  I'm no pussy though and I was not going to let this fine disc of dough, sauce and cheese go to waste!  Once I got past the first initial cheese encounter, the rest of this pizza was freaking fantastic!  It had a great sauce, and fantastic crust.  The bottom and edge of the crust had tons of tiny little air bubbles which makes for an excellent crunch and chew.  This pizza (minus the cheap cheese) reminded me of Hank's Pizza from my childhood growing up in Hawthorne.  Not a \"best thing I ever ate\" type pizza, but just a solid neighborhood pizza joint.  Very similar sauce and crust.  That is a good thing!  I mowed down my 8 small slices and was satisfied.  For $8.00, it was a good lunch!

Overall, I am glad I tried it.  I am going to give it another shot or two and see if my pizza turns out the same the next few times.  If the cheese issue is going to be a standard, not sure I will seek this place out and return often.  But, if it was just a \"one off\", and next time the cheese melds better, this could be a go to joint!  The sauce and crust were some of the best I have found in Phoenix!  Service was friendly and the price was great!"}
{"text":"place use to be close to where i work. used to be good. not sure if it is or not. wanted to try the new location on bell and they were closed on friday after thanksgiving. so we went down the road to marco's pizza. 

thanks angie and jimies!!! 
marco's was good. :-)"}
{"text":"Found this place through Groupon and it's decent if you're not expecting gourmet, brick oven pizza. Prices are very reasonable ($8 for a small 12 inch pizza and $13 for a large 16 inch with each topping being $1). First thing that you notice when you walk in is that the interior was pretty bare. There's not much behind the counter besides the prep table and the oven and the dining seats are mismatched. This is definitely not a place you'd go to impress your date! 

Like what another reviewer experienced, this place ran out of mushrooms. I'm guessing they're always having shortages of mushrooms! It also would have been nice to have more vegetable selection of toppings like spinach or arugula. Pizza was a bit on the oily side but after wiping that off, I'd say it's about a notch better than Domino's or Papa John's. I'd go again just for the proximity from where I live but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
