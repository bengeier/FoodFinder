{"text":"Best Thai food in town. I love their appetizers!"}
{"text":"I am going to review only one aspect of Siam Terrace, the sushi.   I have eaten sushi all over the US, and Siam Terrace is as good as the best, if not the very best sushi I have ever had.   OK, I'll review some more, very good pad Thai, great service, all around best Thai restaurant in town, but the sushi is simply the best anywhere.  Update: We had some very good sushi in Ft. Lauderdale Florida recently, excellent nigiri. Last night, for Valentine's Day (eve) we ordered more sushi from Siam Terrace for take out. Siam Terrace is still the best ever, anywhere. I can't say enough about it, it is that good.  Simply the best."}
{"text":"Sam is one of the best Thai food I had. Their curries tastes decent with a subtle taste of fresh herbs. I attempted to make curry but mine never come close to what they offer.   Never tried their sushi though."}
{"text":"Siam is so-so for the vegetarian or vegan.  Perhaps it's better for the omnivores.  I've tried several dishes there and been underwhelmed.  The tofu is deep fried, but it seems like they must fry it up in the morning and throw it into dishes as needed, as it was cold, oily, and gushy.  The prices are expensive.  The food is much better at Basil Thai in Urbana, although the atmosphere there is more campus."}
{"text":"Always had wonderful service, and even was given free cake on my birthday! Delivery is just okay, opt for take out if you can."}
{"text":"Their noodle dishes are tasty and really satisfying. They are also not too greasy which is wonderful. Also, try the crispy pad thai - it is AMAZING! I ordered it thinking it was noodles with crispy wontons mixed in which would be a nice texture contrast but it is actually just a huge pile of fried wonton skins. It was delicious even though the whole time I was eating it all I could think of was thisiswhyyourefat.com. It's a great dish to share though, I definitely recommend it.  They also have sushi - it's nothing too special but still solid if you are craving sushi.  They even deliver if you're lazy. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the area.  That's not really saying much, but it's actually on par with your average Thai restaurant in SF or NYC.  My favs are the heaven duck, devil fish, papaya salad & panang curry.  They also have the only edible pad thai around.  It's the correct color, consistency, flavor and they don't cut the noodles into a million pieces like Basil Thai - imagine!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The green curry is my typical Thai go-to & at Siam it is the best I have had in years. When it is available, the spicy conch sushi is fantastic, too!"}
{"text":"This review is for the service we received at this restaurant. It was our first time here. We were a party of six. We ordered several appetizers (egg rolls, summer rolls) to share. The server brought the appetizer without bringing any plates; so we had to use our hands to avoid dripping the sauces on our clothes! Then it came the end that we hadn't quite finished our food that they started removing the plates.  It was only 15 minutes after their closing time and we were still eating, that the server asked us to leave because their closing time has passed! We said that it is rude to ask the customer to leave when they haven't finished their food yet, but they said it's past their closing time and they have to close! We complied but asked for a refund of the gratuity that they had automatically charged, and they refunded it."}
{"text":"I went to Siam Terrace for dinner and after tasting every dish at the table I decided it's the best Thai I've had in CU thus far.  Service was friendly and neither intrusive nor absent."}
{"text":"I love their pad thai I have tried diff places and this has def been my favorite.   I order online it's quick and easy!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice service. My favorite hands-down is the Pannang Salmon with asparagus. Delicious! You can taste the kaffir lime leaves. Their other dishes are good too and, unlike many places, the dishes taste quite distinct. We ordered a basil-chicken dish as well as a peanutty tofu dish. They complemented each other nicely."}
{"text":"No great shakes. Expensive for Thai food (even if average for this area) and uninspiring cuisine for the most part."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight.  We had the three in one sampler appetizer...the summer rolls with the peanut sauce were very tasty and crisp, and the egg rolls and crab Rangoon were pretty standard.  I had the Firecracker Chicken which was a huge portion and came with rice and miso soup.  The chicken was crispy and not soggy.  There was just the right amount of sauce and it was not too spicy.  My partner had the Pad Woon Sen Kee Mao with beef.  He said it was okay...not a whole lot of flavor and wished he had asked to have it spicy.  The noodles seemed to clump together which looked somewhat unappetizing.  He also ordered extra beef which our server did not ring in.  It seemed like it took a while for our food to come out, but the restaurant was pretty full so we understood.  Our server was very friendly and refilled our drinks before they were empty.  Get the Thai iced tea!  It was delicious.  We'll return in the future."}
{"text":"My go to Thai restaurant in CU. A little overpriced, but the food is good, way better than any other Thai restaurants in town I've been to.   My favorite dish here is the mock duck basil, amazing! Their curries are hit or miss, sometimes great, other times only OK. The veggie tempura is delicious too!  The delivery always arrives faster than they estimate."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. You cannot find better Thai food this side of the Pacific. There is a great menu selection and everything can be made vegetarian. The spring rolls and sticky rice with mango are absolutely amazing. Good prices for the quality of the food- about $10 for a meal with appetizers.   If you are looking for Champaign Urbana, I definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Here I tried without a doubt, the best Thai dish, 'mock duck basil'. I'm a vegetarian but I still get lots of options in a Thai restaurant, but this dish at this place is just the best. It didn't taste like any other dish, which can happen often in Asian cuisine. The mock duck was perfectly crisp on the outside and well cooked on the inside with full of flavor. I had heard about it from other yelpers and after trying, I can say it is a must try.  Other than that, waiters and waitresses were also great. Prompt and polite service. Oh and their Thai iced tea was also delicious. Slightly sweeter for my taste but next time I'll ask them to make it less sweet. It was just great experience overall"}
{"text":"I visited Siam Terrace with two of my friends and we really enjoyed it! Our waitress was very kind and made sure we really enjoyed our food. We ordered the chicken pad Thai, the lava chicken, and the Mussamun curry. I really enjoyed the lava chicken and the Mussamun Curry, but I thought the pad Thai was very average. As great as this restaurant was, I don't think I'd return because I think there are better Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Urbana! The Pad Thai was delicious, but it is just a little of the pricey side for normal college students."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. The owners are very friendly and understand hospitality.  They have right sized lunch specials during the week and specials going on monthly. My favorites include the lava chicken, pad thai, yellow curry. Definitely with the visit."}
{"text":"The Red Curry Fried Rice is excellent but the Pad Thai is trash"}
{"text":"We really liked it! The dishes we ordered were as good as the equivalents at any Thai restaurant in Chicago, and the portions were also quite generous. It's definitely our favorite of the Thai places we've tried in C-U so far."}
{"text":"I found everything here to be bland. The Pad Thai with tofu was okay, but pretty bland. I tried the Spicy Seitan as well, and it was anything but spicy. Also very bland. The seitan tasted just ok and the vegetables that were listed on the menu weren't in the dish. Everything was edible, but just not that great. If I return to the U of I area I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the experience has been about the same, Good food and Very friendly service. I've had better Thai food but this is the best in CU.  I had the Pad thai, Pad See You, Red Curry and the Tom Kha Gai. I think the Tom Kha Gai was probably the best dish but all dishes left a little to be desired in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't like Thai food (but I dont think that's it), but I have yet to eat here and be satisfied with the meal.  The quantity is enough. But after I pay $15 for a meal and the food is mediocre, it just leaves something to be desired.  I've tried several of the curries and soups.  The meals are satisfactory but not worth the price."}
{"text":"I got take-out from Siam Terrace years ago and wasn't really impressed.  My wife and I got soup, a duck dish, and something else that I don't remember.  The duck dish still had a lot of gristle and bones in the duck pieces, and the soup wasn't that flavorful.  It felt kind of expensive for the amount and quality of food we got; we meant it as a treat meal, but it didn't really feel like one.  It had, however, been a few years and it was a convenient spot for lunch.  Knowing that they had lunch specials, we decided to give it another try.  As you can guess from the number of stars, we won't be trying it again.  The atmosphere/decor is fine - not especially distinctive, not going to really scare anyone off or impress them.  The service was likewise fine, fairly attentive for the lunch rush.  The food was disappointing.  The salads were iceberg lettuce served with a very firm tomato slice and sliced carrot.  The dressing didn't taste much like ginger - it was mostly sweet and very watery, so that there was a puddle left on the plate after finishing the salad itself.  I think I would rather not have had a salad, as opposed to having such a perfunctory one.  For the main dish, I got the red curry and my wife got the pad thai.  The pad thai was really, really sweet.  The red curry was alright - despite being labeled as two peppers on the menu, it didn't have much heat.  I got it with chicken and there wasn't a huge amount of chicken in it.  I really hate to say it, but I felt like some of the distinctive thai flavors - the spice and basil, for instance - were toned down or absent, creating a more Midwesternized version of the dishes.  Portion sizes were alright - we both ended up taking some home to eat later.   Basically, the food was okay.  However, the price for the two lunch specials + 2 iced teas + one thai tea (also incredibly sweet, but it's supposed to be) was about $22 with tax.  For that price, I found myself wishing we'd gone somewhere else and I can't say that anything else on the menu made me want to return."}
{"text":"I simply can't explain my love for this restaurant (despite only having been here while passing through UC a couple times) as well as April-Hope does below.  I will explain, however, that I docked a star because I've had better Thai cuisine...but that was in Chicagoland.  If you're looking for Thai in the U-C area, you can't pass this up."}
{"text":"Food arrived cold, they said they would replace it but they reheated it in the microwave. Then they tried to charge me extra 50% for using a credit card?!! Crazy"}
{"text":"This place is good, I LOVE the mock duck dishes.  I have also had salmon, pad see ew, and pad thai here for entrees and veg dumplings for appetizers.  All of the food I have samples has tasted great, but I must agree with previous reviewers.  This joint is expensive.  I like to order delivery, and I understand that that ain't free.  But somehow, the price always seems to magically increase significantly compared to when I add the prices up myself.    The delivery is fast, the food is tasty, I feel it's a little over-priced."}
{"text":"Great place! I always enjoy going there. Once the food took super long, but every place messes up once. I love their noodle dishes and their curries. It is all good."}
{"text":"Waiting in line for seating on a Friday night is not only a sign of a quality restaurant, it's practically a necessity. Although, we waiting in front of a guy who complained loudly of the high prices on the take-out.  But it was all worth it. I had the chicken fried rice and wouldn't change a thing except the portion sizes...they were huge. And my group got served in under fifteen minutes despite all tables being filled to capacity. Impressive."}
{"text":"I just had my first ever Siam Terrace carry out box lunch special, and I am really impressed.   It's a shame they don't advertise it better, because it's a really great deal and very convenient.  It's for carry out only, and $8.50 gets you an egg roll, salad, and your choice of Thai fried rice, Spicy fried rice, Pad See You, or Red Curry. You can get the entrees with either chicken or vegetable. That said, I got a Pad Thai with tofu and vegetables today and it only cost me an extra $2. They don't seem to be terribly picky about substitutions.   The portions were smaller than if you eat in, but I was still stuffed. It comes in a really nice little partitioned tray that's sturdy enough to be reused (free tupperware - score!). They will also deliver if you order 2 or more of the boxed lunches."}
{"text":"My favorite Pad See Ewe and the best thai in Champaign Urbana. Their yellow curry is a second favorite and their sushi is always very fresh."}
{"text":"Mock duck yummy vegan dishes! Yummy! Get them now! Eat them now! mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer here for over 3 years. I have only just started a yelp account after hearing how important it is from friends and, after having lunch here today, thought I should give it my honest review. This is an amazing restaurant. In my opinion, it is probably the most consistent place I have ever been to! The spicy fried rice is unbelievable and so is their pad thai and pad see yoo. What separates this place from other Thai restaurants in town, including their sister place My Thai, is that you can bet your bottom dollar that the food will be in the exact same condition as it was the last time you went in, which is great. You will never come into this place and leave saying \"the pad thai this time was alright but yesterday's was way better.\" Never! It is so consistently good that it has become one of my favorite restaurants in all of Champaign and that is saying something! For anyone looking for a Thai restaurant or looking to get into Thai food (and away from make-you-sick Chinese) then this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"They have amazing mock duck, arguably the best sushi in Champaign-Urbana, great lunch specials, and tasty appetizers.  I've always experienced excellent service at Siam Terrace as well.  The restaurant itself doesn't have a lot of atmosphere, but the magnificent food and good service will soon make you forget that.    The sushi is a great value -- very large rolls."}
{"text":"Other than the spiciness, I was very underwhelmed by their pad thai.  The employee who took my order messed up twice while trying to take my order over the phone only to be told by a second employee that I can't place the order and receive the discount unless I do it online."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in C-U. We enjoy the Chiang Mai curry noodles, mock duck basil, mock duck curry, crab rangoon, Thai sausage, pad see ewe, and banana blossom salad. They make their own coconut ice cream and mango ice cream."}
{"text":"Just to give a premise, I have lived in Thailand for two years and I know how good their food tastes. This is a pretty good Thai restaurant.  I ordered Chicken satay for appetizers and Panang curry, firecracker chicken, and pad thai noodles for main course. Chicken satay and Pad thai noodles are decently good, there are places that serve better than here. However, the firecracker chicken and panag curry were a delight. Both of these were made perfect, with a little bit spice and touch of peanut in the taste. I have not had better firecracker chicken and panang curry in Urbana Champaign till now. I would definitely go back for these two.  The portions are good enough for two people and the food is delivered in a decemt time. The staff is courteous and well mannered. Ambience is also good, especially with a nice view of historic Urbana."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I like it. The service is quick, friendly, and attentive. The food is pretty good. My favorite dish so far is the pad see ew because it has a nice balance of protein, veggies, and noodles. I tried the pad thai once, and I can never get myself to order it again. It was edible, but it tasted different than any other pad thai I've had at other restaurants."}
{"text":"I order from Siam Terrace every once in awhile. I find their Thai food to be a little on the sweet side but it's not bad at all. I love that they have sushi -- it's not bad especially if its delivered!   Overall I'm not totally excited about Siam Terrace but I definitely would recommend it to any thai/sushi lovers."}
{"text":"A surprising find!  Panang Salmon tasted great with fish a bit hard which is expected in a stew. Lettuce wrap was small but delish The summer roll came with peanut based sauce Pineapple fried rice with veggies is great accompaniment to the Basil Eggplant Will be back to try the sticky rice with mango!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Visiting the area after a long day of traveling. Used yelp to find a good Thai place to deliver to my hotel. Person on the phone had no clue what they were doing. He immediately took my personal information before I could even ask if they delivered. Then he indicated he thought they did.   Their yelp ad mentioned a free app if you indicated you found them on yelp. I mentioned the add and it took. Several minutes of listening to their background conversation before they.   Determined they would only give me that if I came to the restaurant.  After all the hassle the supervisor came on and confirmed they didn't honor the ad regardless of the fact the ad didn't specify. So I said I would just cancel what would have been at least a $50 order. She said ok and just hung up. Wow. I guess they don't need the business."}
{"text":"We had two very satisfying lunches here. Both times I got the Pad See Ew. Asking for a spiciness of 1 out of 4 yielded a great sweet and salty blend. The atmosphere is just okay, but we had great service and delicious food - can't complain and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ founded Siam Terrace in 1992 when he could not find Thai Food on earth like God used to make."}
{"text":"The waiters are very responsive! Our dishes were ready in just several minutes, fastest in my experience except fast food. They have duck here. Looking forward to trying more dishes"}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone raves about this place. The first time my food wasn't that great, I blamed myself for not ordering the right dish. But, I have eaten from Siam Terrace many times now and my opinion is still the same. Even basic things like Pad-thai, Pad kee mao ended up not meeting my expectations. I don't think I would ever order from here again."}
{"text":"What should have been an hour lunch turned into almost an hour and 45 minutes. The ONLY reason I have given them any star at all is that the sushi, when it finally did arrive, was good. They are SEVERELY understaffed, both in the kitchen and with servers. When we arrived and asked about how long it would take to get sushi, our server told us 15-20 minutes--that stretched into close to 35 minutes. The second order showed up almost immediately and the last one took close to 20 minutes. For the most part there were two girls taking orders, busing tables and answering the phone--at one point another server did show up to help with the full restaurant. Our bill was incorrect and it took talking, more like arguing with the owner to get it rectified, then the owner yelled at one of the servers in front of the patrons--bad customer service."}
{"text":"Great food!  I highly recommend the curries and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food in downtown Urbana. I went there for dinner on a Friday night, and the place was almost packed.   The menu is very extensive, and carry most typical Thai dishes. I ordered a cup of Tom Kha Gai, which was delicious and which I highly recommend (btw the cup is more a bowl than a cup, and is plenty for one person). For my entree, I got the spicy fried catfish, which was also quite good: fried catfish filet stir-fried in a spicy sauce and topped with crispy basil leaves. The portion was very large and it was tasty, but I wish it had come with some vegetables.  The service was prompt and efficient and pretty friendly (but what is up with bringing the check before I'm done eating?). I'll probably be back.  3-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"This review is wayyy overdue so hopefully Siam Terrace is still the same as it was when I last visited. If you decide to come here, you can't leave without trying the crispy pad Thai. It's a nice change since the dish is made from wonton skins as opposed to noodles."}
{"text":"So many people told me that this is the best place in town to get Thai food, and I was sorely disappointed, especially since I took my mom here.  The panang curry and thai basic rice were not memorable. The pad thai was bland, and the lad nar was way too salty. We also ordered the mixed appetizer plate that came with bland chicken eggrolls and spring rolls entirely filled with lettuce for which the sauce could not compensate for taste.  Add the strange ambiance involving Top 40 hits in the background and you have an establishment that far from impressed me.   The worse thing was I found this restaurant to be expensive for the area.  Maybe their business lays in their sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty good for its pineapple fired rice and the homemade source"}
{"text":"We have been going to Siam Terrace for many years.  Their sushi and rolls have always been a favorite of ours.  However, recently things have taken a turn for the worse.  When we visited this weekend, we noticed that our sushi rice was dry.  The rolls had no sauce.  Worst of all, the size of the rolls and the amount of fish in the rolls were tiny.  When we asked the waitress about the change in quality, she told us they hired a new sushi chef.  Their other menu items are still outstanding, but the sushi and rolls were a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese ever!!! Had their pad Thai and it was horrible and the texture was Discusting! Their crab Rangoon was decent but other than that horrible"}
{"text":"Big fan. Big, big fan. Frankly, it's pretty difficult to screw up Pad Thai, let's face it. I will eat Thai food anywhere, but Siam Terrace is the best in town. Apart from the fact that they deliver (I think the ONLY Thai restaurant who do), they have the best egg rolls in town, the best appetizer list, and literally everything is wonderful on the menu. The restaurant isn't perfect in terms of decor, but it is in a really cool old building. The service is generally great, the delivery is quick, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."}
{"text":"Among all of the Thai restaurants in Champaign-Urbana, this one is by far the best! The curries and stir fries have a generous amount of vegetables, cooked just the right amount and the updates to the interior show a nice improvement in ambience and freshness. I recommend this place to travelers and locals alike!"}
{"text":"First timers here. Food tasted and looked super fresh. What we got was very healthy! (Pad woo Sen & Tom yum) Full of protein and veggies not a huge amount of noodles. Not greasy either. The Thai tea was awesome. We really enjoyed that.   We really love thai food and keep making our rounds trying new restaurants to see which is our favorite thai place. So far, this isn't at the top of our list. Yes, good food and great customer service but I've had better around here."}
{"text":"Called in for veggie stir fry with tofu. The food was delivered before time & was hot & tasted good. Would love to have it again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Siam Terrace now for about a year and I have to say, they've upped their game, the service is better (fantastic even), and the food has never failed to impress.  So for all of you Thai-jonesin' folk, Siam is well worth a slot on your rotation.  Nice work :)"}
{"text":"Love this place always enjoyed the food. I have had dinner in the restaurant it's nothing fancy  the the food is so good! Best Thai food in town!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi considering it's chambana. My sister even tried a spicy tuna roll even though she \"doesn't\" like sushi. I could tell that she didn't appreciate the texture...she had that \"I'm gonna puke, but not because it tastes bad\" look. I think we all know what I'm talking about.   Overall, a good night out. I'd return, but I'm guessing that I'll try something different next time since I don't visit the Alma mater that frequently."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I live on Mattis and they deliver to me. Friendly staff. Killer pad thai. Best tofu dishes in town! Get the eggplant tempura, even if you hate egg plant, you will not regret this!!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Siam Terrace a few years ago and told the waiter I needed a gluten free meal I was provided a delicious meal which did not digest well with me. I have gone in for a meal since then and every time I inform the waiter that I need a gluten free meal I am told they cannot provide any sauce and am brought out a bland plate of rice, tofu and veggies. Please get on the gluten free bandwagon, educate your kitchen staff and servers, and find a way to safely provide tastey gluten free meals! I have been to many other Thai resteraunts in the country and know it can be done."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in all of Champaign-Urbana! I only ever order take-out so I can't really rate the wait-staff but the people taking the orders over the phone are very polite and accommodating. And there's always someone with a smile when I come pick up the food.   The food is great, I love the pad thai (my number one dish), thai fried rice, and mussamun curry (don't like this anywhere but here). The chicken egg rolls and crab rangoon are great as well.   I highly recommend it! =)"}
{"text":"My son likes this a bit better than I.  He loves the sweet rice and mango dessert."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant.  The food is generally delicious, they have a great selection of appetizers, and it's not too expensive.  I usually order a curry, which always comes out deliciously fantastic, and I have a love affair with the eggplant tempura.  Buuuut the last time I dined there I switched it up with a Mock Duck with Basil.    This dish sounded totally delicious, and just to emphasize with the waitress what I wanted, I made sure the dish was 100% vegan before proceeding.  That being said, I was hugely disappointed when, instead of mock duck with basil, I got duck with basil.  This is after having the waitress double-check that the order was vegan, and me saying \"MOCK duck\" several times as she took my order.  So there I was, a lowly vegan in a usually veg-friendly place, with a huge slab of dead meat in front of me.  This upset me far more than I could convey; when they finally brought out the \"real\" mock (somewhat ironic, I know) duck, it was great.  It may seem like an innocent screw-up back in the kitchen, but as someone who has devoted the rest of their life to help end the suffering of animals, I was no happy camper.  For this reason, I can't give it more than 3 stars.  Go here, you'll have a good meal, but be warned... the service is frequently slow, and your order might get really messed up..."}
{"text":"Really nicely done!  The perfect amount of chili pepper heat, and served steaming hot. I will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the C-U area. On one occasion I asked for no onions on my rice and they sent it with onions so I called them back and they sent me a new one, no questions asked. I've also ordered seafood dishes from them multiple times and they're always fresh. Bottom line: excellent food, excellent customer service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. I always get the pad woon sen and there is so much flavor. I've tried other things on the menu and everything is just as good. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love this Thai place. It is my favorite Thai place in town. The owner also owns My Thai on Springfield Avenue in Champaign. The food is always fresh and ready to go when you order. The staff is great."}
{"text":"They make the food really sweet. Their noodles is not very good but I think the curries are ok."}
{"text":"I order the shrimp salad for delivery and it was very tasty. However I paid $11 for 5 pieces of shrimp and three pieces of greens...seasoning was great but I was expecting a much bigger portion. On the plus side, delivery took only about 15 mins."}
{"text":"One of CU's nicest Thai restaurants- great for takeout or dining in.   I had the Bangkok Duck here and it was absolutely delicious- just the right blend of crispness and juiciness, with a wonderful sauce that paired perfectly with the rice. It was a little bit pricey, but worth it.   I also tried the potstickers, which were quite nice (though I wish I had asked for them steamed), and the fried bananas, which were rich and sweet. Compared to Thara Thai this restaurant is a much less inclined towards the spicy and many dishes seem to have sweet ingredients like tamarind. However, many dishes can be made spicy...or vegetarian for that matter.  Definitely recommended! I think anyone could find something to enjoy here."}
{"text":"This is review is based on the only two dishes we had.   Food came in relative small portion for the price, maybe we were starving that day, but we almost licked the dish dry.   The food is fresh, but the taste is nothing more than ordinary.  In summary, a so-so place that we probably won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! Try the thai iced tea (it has sweetened condensed milk) :) Also love anynof the curry dishes, stir fry, pad thai, or minced chicken and basil."}
{"text":"Vegan and vegetarian options! Talk to your server about g/f. I didn't go g/f for this meal, but they are conscious of dietary concerns. The Veggie Supreme with tofu was pretty great. I got it spiced at a 3 and it was well balanced. Next time I'll try a 4 though. I like my thai food blow-your-face-off spicy! Plenty of veggies in the dish, cut into perfect chunks and sizes. The light soy sauce that made up the sautee was sweet amd savory, a great play. The tofu was a little rubbery, but the flavor didn't suffer. Served with Jasmine rice, this dish was enough to fill me up just  right.  The fresh roll (summer roll? Spring roll? Whatever...) was disappointing. Shredded ice berg lettuce with a few whispy carrots and exactly 6 rice noodles. It was like eating air wrapped in rice paper. The peanut dipping sauce was good though. I'll save my money and avoid the sub-par appetizer so I can try an extra dish next time. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have never had a terrible experience at Siam Terrace thus far. Their Thai dishes are delicious, some more than others. I like their fried rice and really enjoy their salad. The prices aren't bad and the portions are good.   I also tried their sushi before and it was pretty good. However, the last time I visited they told us that they weren't serving sushi at the time. Not sure why or if they have a specific time for it but that was somewhat disappointing. So call ahead if you want sushi!   Still, I like Siam. I feel like it's one of the few good Thai places around Chambana. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is always great. Me and my wife have been their multipule times and never a bad meal. I live in indianapolis and this place is as good if not better than anyplace here in the city."}
{"text":"My Pad Thai was too wet and too sweet for my taste, far too spare on scallions. It was good, but not phenomenal.  The dressing on the house salad is very nice."}
{"text":"nothing to complain about with Siam Terrace, the lunch specials are excellent with my preference for the Lava Chicken.  My wife swears the beef pad thai is the best in champaign/urbana.  This is about as good as you will find for thai anywhere."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are well priced and offer a large selection.  The place is always crowded, no booths, a bit loud, but wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"The thai food is ok. Not as good as basil thai in my opinion. Haven't had the chance to try their sushis yet though."}
{"text":"Very easy to get a reservation even on a Friday evening..The menu seemed really promising and so did the appetizer we ordered - crab Rangoon..however the spicy fried rice was a disappointment and was fairly bland. The fried and marinated noodle shrimp was also average. Maybe we ordered the wrong options in the menu..give it a try once but only go for regular safe options!"}
{"text":"Visited one of my favorite restaurants in Urbana this week and I was extremely disappointed.  NO sushi. Of course because that is what I was craving. I have had the best sushi at this restaurant, but not this time. The waitress said \"we are out\" how about \"we are no longer serving sushi at this time.\"  Sushi bar is completely gone. I decided to order one of my favorite entrees, Pad Woon Sin, not a good choice this trip. Oh and BTW at dinner time they do not serve salad and soup. Which is another of my favorites!!  I was overall very disappointed.  I can say the server was attentive."}
{"text":"Good! I like! This place made the pad se ewe right on. It hit my mark and I'm loving it!"}
{"text":"I love their red curry fried rice !  Their food is overall very delicious. Atmosphere is not as bad as how it looks from outside."}
{"text":"Siam Terrace is probably second for Thai food in CU. And even then it's pretty close. Both restaurants have their particular strengths so part of it depends on what you're in the mood for. The staff is very friendly although sometimes a little slow if it gets busy. I think they have the best pad thai in town. To me it has the perfect blend of sweetness, nutiness and spice complimented by the fresh bite of the cilantro and crunch of sprouts and shredded carrot. It's sweeter than your typical pad thai but it's very well balanced overall.  Their appetizers are nicely priced and I have enjoyed all of them that I tried. I would not recommend the Thom Kha soup here. It's a bit too sweet and lacks some of the depth of other versions of this soup I've had. It's not bad by any means, but it wasn't what I was looking for in that soup. Be bold with spice here. It can vary, but I find that they tend to be a bit more gentle with the spice overall.  A big plus for Siam Terrace is its selection of sushi. It's decently priced for the most part and everything I've had is tasty. I'd definitely recommend their Bakery sushi. It's moderately priced and is battered and served with some excellent eel sauce. Be careful when you first get it though as it's VERY hot.  For a drink, I recommend trying the coconut juice or Thai Iced Tea. Both are refreshing and a great, sweet compliment to the spicier dishes."}
{"text":"I was looking to get some Thai food takeout last Saturday and found Siam Terrace had a moderately priced menu and good online reviews so I thought I would try it out.   I ordered from the \"House Specialty\" section of the Thai Cuisine menu and got the \"Ramrong with chicken\" (steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, baby corn, celery and Napa cabbage topped with \"special peanut sauce\").  The order was ready very quickly (5-10 minutes after I ordered) which was a plus, but the food was very, very disappointing. Basically it was a to go container filled with boiled vegetables and chicken. The chicken was thin, gray, and unseasoned and the vegetables were also completely devoid of flavor. The only somewhat redeeming part of the dish was the \"special peanut sauce\" that was a tiny portion compared to the amount of rice and vegetables given. The peanut sauce reminded of the Woody Allen quote in Annie Hall,   \"The food at this place is terrible.\"  \"Ya, and such small portions.\"  I digress...  All of this being said, I don't know if I will ever order takeout from Siam Terrace again. However, walking inside the restaurant to pickup my order I did see what some of the guests were eating and it looked much better than my sad plate of Ramrong."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. LOVE it. I didn't love anything about the foods I tried today. The salad, maybe - that was interesting and very tasty. When I saw onion dressing on the menu and it came out looking simply as grated onion over the lettuce, I wasn't expecting much. It was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely order the salad again. Our table shared the mussels, a spider roll, chicken satay, and lava chicken. The mussels were MASSIVE! I was expecting them to come in a bowl cooked in sauce as I'm used to, but these are served on a plate with a dish of cold sauce to dip them in. The sauce is a vinaigrette that was supposed to have some heat, but I didn't notice any. The spider roll was exactly what I'm used to. Very small wasabi/ginger portions! The chicken satay was a-ok. I've had amazing, this doesn't compare. The peanut sauce really helped, though. The lava chicken had no heat at all. It looked tasty but was actually very bland.   The service was very good and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I order here all the time. Good prices, amazing food and nice selection. Lovely and wonderful staff. I highly recommend the Pad See Yu and well everything else you can get here. The mussel appetizer is amazing as well. I could sit and tell you everything about this nice intimate little spot but all I can do now is give it five stars and urge you to have a wonderful Thai experience at Siam Terrace"}
{"text":"My roommate and I ordered delivery from Siam Terrace. It was the first time we'd had their food, and we got very basic stuff: 2 orders of tofu pad thai-level 1 spicy (don't judge me), an order of their tempura eggplant, and two vegetarian spring rolls. The flavor was good with all of the dishes. I was confused when my roommate took a few bites of her pad thai and said that she thought it was more like level 2 or 3 spicy, while I had eaten three bites of mine and it was more like level 0. Turns out the red pepper flakes were not dispersed evenly in the pad thai, so there were big clumps of spice among plain pad thai, which was the only not-ideal part of it. The tempura eggplant was pretty good, still decently crispy by the time it was delivered, as were the spring rolls. Solid basic thai food. Next time I'll try some of my other favorites!"}
{"text":"i have most definitely had better thai food than what siam terrace offers, after all i am from los angeles, home to the most vibrant thai town in america.  that being said, siam terrace offers decent thai food...that delivers!   t.j., nicolle, and i once went for dinner but it was just so much better brought to my door. granted the driver forgot to look at my address and i had to stay on the phone with him until he found my building, but the piping hot pad ke mao was worth it!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is very nice and appealing.  The service is friendly and quick.  The food was delicious!  The portions were very nice for sharing, too.  My only suggestion for this restaurant would be to add traditional Thai fresh spring rolls to their appetizer menu."}
{"text":"Siam is my favorite Thai restaurant in Urbana. I love their vegetarian options (even though I eat meat) - they make a mean mock duck and they are willing to substitute Seitan into just about any dish. I discovered the CRISPY pad thai about a year ago, and it's become my favorite dish (pad thai that's fried? what's not to love??).  The very best part about this restaurant is the fact that they deliver to Urbana residents EAST of Vine st. My only complaint about this place is the variable service (esp since they don't take reservations). I've been here for both dinner and lunch on several occasions and I have to say depending on which server you get, the service is either great or horrendous. beware..."}
{"text":"I've been ordering their \"two thai pastas for $15.99\" deal, and it has been fantastic every time.  I generally get the crispy pad thai, which comes with fried wontons and an excellent pad thai sauce.  Delivery is generally on the longer side, at around 45 minutes, but it is delicious once you get it."}
{"text":"I got the Firecracker chicken with 3 out of 5 on the spice level and Thai iced coffee last week. The chicken could be spicier for the level i ordered, so i would suggest to get the spice level one above your comfort zone. The thai iced coffee was decent  but there are other places with better Thai iced tea in Champaign. Overall i loved the food and the place has a nice ambience too."}
{"text":"Saddened to learn that my favorite restaurant in Chambana no longer serves sushi nor sashimi nor raw fish of any kind."}
{"text":"My fiance likes to come here because he adores the Lava Trio when he's feeling gluttonous.  The management and wait staff are all very lovely, but I personally am not a huge fan.  It's overpriced and located smack-dab in downtown Urbana.  The flavor tends to be overpowering or boring, so I prefer to stick with Thara Thai, located on Bloomington Road in Champaign."}
{"text":"Love the soup! Overall the food has been very good. They did mix up a take out order though. I would definitely go back and eat in. So glad to have a Thai restaurant here in Urbana.  All of the staff are super friendly and the sushi is great, especially the dragon roll."}
{"text":"Best thai in town, just a bit expensive. Love almost everything on the menu. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a solid Thai place for Urbana. The downtown location and historic building are nice. Our service was good. The food we ordered was very good, but entirely memorable. We had the Firecracker Chicken and Beef Panang Curry. The chicken was nice and crispy, but the spices left us wanting more of a kick. The housemade curry was warm and yummy. Prices seem a couple dollars higher than comparable meals around town."}
{"text":"Short review - I ordered it level 4 spicy, it had not a hint of heat. Both noodle dishes I ordered, Pad Thai and Pad See You were kind of boring. I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Note:  I only get Pad See Ew at Thai restaurants....  Decent Pad See Ew.  No complaints - if you ask for it spicy they make it HOT.  Be careful with that.  Service is always good, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Siam Terrace is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Urbana. It's also memorably one of the few restaurants I have a favorite dish at just because they make a red curry so well. Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.  It's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.  While I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half. Prices are very reasonable, with my favorite red curry starting at $8.99 or so for the vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees (usually no more than $12 in the case of seafood)."}
{"text":"Wow!  I will certainly be coming back!  (And I will edit this review as fits.)  We went on a Monday evening.  It's a small restaurant and I've heard people complain about how it is decorated and kept, but I really liked it.  It was clean and neat and small inside, though it is in a strip of bars and other neon-lighted windows.  If you think you're in the wrong place, you might not be.    Once you get inside, however, it's decorated like your classic Thai restaurant.  We got the summer rolls as an appetizer and that was the beginning of the *yum* experience.  Very fresh veggies in a light wrapping, dipped in a spiced peanut sauce.  I didn't think it could get any tastier until I got my dish, a house curry with tofu.  I forget the exact name of it now--I'll edit this later for it.  The first one on the curry menu, though; it's really worth trying.  I got a 3.5/4 spicy rating (yes, I did ask for the .5, thank you very much ;-)).  I like how they have this scale, to be honest.  Anyways, delicious!  Perfectly spiced, not just in a hot way, but in a everything-is-done-right-down-to-the-last-grain-of-spice perfect.  I don't even know how to describe it aside from that.  The tofu was cooked perfectly.  The service was also excellent; we had two young women as our waitresses because one was training and the other, teaching.  Unlike many trainees, our waitress was very professional even though it was apparent that she was new.  The waitresses were very attentive and the service overall was very fast, but did not give up any quality for the speed.  Anyways, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from us. They make accommodations for vegans and vegetarians which is greatly appreciated. They aren't the best Thai food that I've ever had, but they are our favorite within a 20 mile radius. Glad to have them so close to us."}
{"text":"The food: Tasty & spicy-if-you-want-it-to-be food. The pad see ew wasn't too heavy on the sauce but made me parched for the rest of the day. The duck noodle soup was excellent - very flavourful, non-soggy noodles, good broth, large chunks of duck. Both were deliciously spicy as we had requested.  The value: It seemed a bit pricy for comparable food. Maybe because this place is off campus? There was no lunch menu. Maybe because today is a Saturday? The pad see ew noodle dish was $10, the duck soup was $15. Including tax & tip, we rang up a little over $30 for 2 people.  The atmosphere: Siam Terrace was a warm respite from the windy & cold walk to get there. It's located conveniently in downtown & was peaceful for a Saturday. The wait staff was attentive & kept our glasses filled. The decor isn't outstanding, nor is it hideous."}
{"text":"It's the most consistently delicious food in Champaign-Urbana. Everything is good: the soups, the noodle dishes, the sushi, the curry, the fish, the duck, the deserts... it's all amazing.   Their lunches are every bit as good as their dinners, only smaller and more inexpensive. A great value."}
{"text":"I *really* enjoyed my dining experience at Siam Terrace.  Well, lunching experience, I suppose I should say.  They had awesome lunch specials ($6-8 per entree, with a side salad starter).  I tried their Red Curry with tofu, 2-star spicy.  It was a little bit weak for 2-stars, but not so much so that I was actually disappointed.  It was positively loaded with tofu and vegetables, which pleased me greatly.  The serving size was more than ample for the price.  I left, fat and happy.  The waitstaff was on top of their game, except for forgetting to give me utensils until I asked for them.  But this request was met by an embarrassed apology and prompt service.  The food came out quickly, considering the restaurant was not exactly devoid of customers.  The waitress was very pleasant.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Though their menu might appear pricey especially for dinner, the dishes are completely worth it. Try the Panang salmon with asparagus, the Heaven duck curry, the Pad Thai, or any of their red/green/yellow curry dishes. If you're vegetarian try the mock duck curry. For soups, tom kha gai is yum. They also serve smaller portions at lunch. For dessert, try their seasonal Sticky rice with mango - while I've never been a fan of mangoes in the US, this restaurant knows how to pick their mangoes! For drink, try the Thai iced coffee/tea.  Service is always wonderful. They also have wines and liquors, but c'mon who drinks wine with Thai food? :)  Just don't try their sushi."}
{"text":"The best part of eating at Siam Terrace is the historic Knights of Pythias Building in which it is located.  Tin ceilings, 16 feet high, add to the drama.  And the owner and his family are great folks.  We had an all sushi/sashimi dinner and the boat presentation was a work of art. The miso soup is perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"Alway good service. Sit-in or carry out. I LOVE THEIR GILLED GINGER SALMON. Just had their spicy catfish and it was delicious. This last time I went I noticed like ten carry outs were picked up during our meal. We did receive our food in a timely manner. But there were only two couples dining in. I did notice they need to dust the fans. I'm tall I always notice that stuff."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty critical of Thai places, just because I've been to Thailand and thoroughly tasted a ton of local dishes there, but this place was definitely a nice surprise - tucked in downtown Urbana! Note: this review is strictly based off of the restaurant week menu and not indicative of their whole regular menu (though they probably make the same items the same way). Came with the BF during restaurant week in Champaign and was definitely overwhelmed with the amount of food we could get with it being $15.99 per person. First of all, we went for lunch, so I wasn't expecting to eat that much anyways. Turns out, their restaurant week lunch and dinner menu was the same - so...that meant three course meal with dinner sized portions for lunch.  For the first course, I got the House Salad with Onion Dressing - just meh in my opinion, didn't even finish it because the onion dressing was definitely too overpowering and I could hardly swallow it with the salad. BF got the crab rangoon and it was also pretty meh - I didn't really enjoy the crab rangoons, which were a little too flavorless and way too creamy/cheesy for me. Aftertaste was not to my liking, but that could just be crab rangoons in general.  Second course, we struck gold. I got the Chicken Pumpkin Curry, which came in this HUGE saucer pan that could probably feed my family of four and was paired with a separate small bowl of rice. Curry was mildly spicy and very creamy and sweet, and definitely had that coconuty-pumpkin-puree-milky flavor that coated the huge quantity of chicken, onions, and carrots submerged within. The chicken was definitely on the dry side and the carrots a little uncooked, but for the quantity and the taste of the curry itself, I had no complaints (in fact, I took most of it home as leftovers to recook and now it tastes much better). BF got the tomyum, which I asked the waiter to add the MOST amount of hot pepper he could....and yes...it was extremely spicy. With a little of the pumpkin curry and a side of lime added to it, the tomyum+glass noodles became the creamy, spicy, tangy, dish that I remembered tasting at the street vendors on Phuket Island. It also came in a gigantuous bowl...and if you've ever tried the Samyang Stir Fried Korean Ramen Noodles...that's how spicy their max level of spicy was for this bowl.   Third course was dessert (by this time we were both bloated) - and I got the sticky rice with thai custard and bf got the molten chocolate cake. Molten chocolate cake was delicious (not sure if it was made from scratch though since it really has nothing thai about it), and the sticky rice had sprinkles of sesame seed and was soaked in some version of condensed milk/coconut that gave it both a nutty and milky sweet taste. Not a fan of the custard though, though honestly by that time my taste buds were probably dulled from satiation.  Would definitely need to come here again on a regular, non-restaurant week day to try their other red, green, etc curries!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening. It wasn't too full, but had a good number of people in it. Between the four of us, we ordered, the Lava Trio, Pad Thai, Thai beef noodle soup (Thai pho) with a crab rangoon on the side, and a vegetarian tofu stir fry. We also ordered three rolls of sushi   Atmosphere (2/5) Not fancy, very casual, chill. Like most Champaign Asian restaurants, a little dingy. There is a small outdoor seating section, and some nice natural light near the front with the windows.  Food (3/10) Let me start with the good. The crab rangoon was good. I mistakenly ordered it after reading the reviews for the My Thai crab rangoon, but I was pleasantly surprised because I enjoyed it. The Lava Trio was also decent. Not the freshest seafood (alright not fresh at all), but it was tasty albeit expensive.   That is all that was good about this place. The Pad Thai and vegetable stir were both  too salty and too sweet. The beef noodle soup was basically salted basil water, with a heaping serving of oil. On top of that, our server decided not to bring out the sushi until well after we were finished eating the rest of the food despite asking for the sushi first. When the sushi finally came out, one of the rolls, called the White Bear, came with very little scallop in the roll, and on top of that, my dad who orders the roll regularly, commented on how it was the worst White Bear he has ever had. The Volcano was some kind of crab cake on top of a basic California roll. The Bangkok roll, which I ordered after reading various reviews, was a heap load of good ingredients thrown together into one mess of a roll. That one I picked apart and ate the pieces individually. Not bad.  Service (2/5) Our server seemed nice enough, but unfamiliar with the menu. When I asked for opinions about her favorite dishes, she barely had any opinions because she barely had touched the food. At least she was honest. However, When we complained about the White Bear being subpar, she gave us a dirty questioning look, apologized, and offered free desert as compensation, which unfortunately, we did not try because we were full.   Value (2/5) The food was not that good. Ok it was pretty bad. And also not cheap. Our bill came to over 100 for four people. Three of us did not enjoy our meal.   Overall the whole experience breaks down like so:  Atmosphere: 2/5 (Dingy with some decent natural lighting near the windows.) Service: 2/5 (Server gave us dirty looks when we complained about the White Bear.) Value: 1/5 (Small portions + bad food = sad wallet.) Food: 3/10 (Parts of the meal were edible but not much was enjoyable.) Overall: 8/25 - Would have to pull teeth to make me go back. Try at your own risk. Maybe you will have better luck."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is nice and cozy. They have a great menu with options for a lot of dietary choices, including vegetarian and vegan. The mock basil duck is AMAZING. I am not even vegetarian, and I will choose it over meat items most of the time. You can get varying levels of spice, which is really nice for me, even if I do always get questioned when I order level five spice. I like my food corrosively spicy, so it does get a bit annoying to be asked every single time I order. However, I do understand why they have to do it, because they probably get complaints. If you're a spicy addict like me, go up a higher level than you think on the pad woonsen, as it does not hold spice as well as some of the other dishes. This is true of a few dishes, but others hold spice very well, so you might want to try a dish once then adjust for future orders. I am not sure if they still do it, but I have been able to order spice levels even above what the menu states is available, so if you really love spice, ask to see if is still an option."}
{"text":"Egg plant tempura and Pad Thai are my favorite from this place! The atmosphere and the service is really nice. It can be slow at times, but mostly fast."}
{"text":"Big menu with a lot of options. The serving sizes are big so I recommend sharing with someone or plan to have leftovers. The tofu pad thai was delicious and I definitely recommend it. Good service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Upgrade after actually going inside.  I really enjoy places serving both Thai and Japanese food.  It's the wave of the future.  The next chicken-n-waffles.  Liked that the decor here wasn't too over the top.  Fake flowers were the only off note.  Warmly painted walls; artwork that doesn't hurt your eyeballs.  Service good, friendly and fast.  They actually seemed to care how we liked the food.  Sushi here was solid; there were some inventive rolls.  Everything sushi prepared at an open style counter towards the back.  To me one mark of good a Thai joint is the tom kah.  It's fairly amazing in the flavor department here.  Loved it- but for the mushrooms; not straw like would've expected, just regular plain old button mushrooms.  It was the only off flavor in the soup.  Red curry was nice.  A three on the spicy level was perfect, but next time I'd ask for three and a half.  The salad dressing on our tiny side salads was so good both myself and dining companion drank the last left in our bowls.  Oh, and the best part: forty bucks got both of us enough food for 2-3 meals."}
{"text":"We have eaten Thai in several of the big cities in Illinois and out east. This is some of the best in central Illinois! Their sushi is top notch and just as good as the big sushi places in C-U. They offer soft shell crab which is unheard of in the Midwest and just as amazing! Their base spice in the panang curry is perfect and goes up from there. My husband loves pad see ew and their homemade noodles are a delicacy! Great staff and clean, welcoming environment. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Just had the pleasure of eating here.  My friends and I are from out of town.  The food was awesome! The prices were amazing.  From the sushi, to the key lime pie, I highly recommend Siam Terrace. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Pad see ew is really fantastic here. I got the pad thai initially and was not a fan at all. However, now that I found \"my dish\" I've been back a few times in the last couple of weeks."}
{"text":"This is perhaps some of the best Thai food I've had around campus. It is a bit pricey, but I don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian friendly Thai food around!! I find myself seriously craving their mock duck basil and mock duck curry dishes as well as their steamed vegetable wontons! Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the most bland food ever.  Chicken in pad thai basil stir fry and tom yum all in edible. No heat at all   Baby corn in thai food?  I will never return."}
{"text":"This was my first Thai restaurant I've tried in Illinois since having been spoiled with excellent Thai food in California. I came to Siam Terrace after reading the reviews on yelp, and I have to say that I was not disappointed!   My friend and I ordered the eggroll appetizer, the panang curry and the pad thai. All of which were very delicious! We ordered the sticky rice with mango, which was decent. And I ordered the Thai iced tea which was okay.   I will definitely be going back here to get my Thai food fix!"}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for Thai food in downtown Urbana. They have both vegan and vegetarian dishes. I almost always order the Panang Curry: sweet panang curry paste, green beans, kaffir and lime leaves. I pay extra to get both tofu and additional vegetables. It comes with rice. I tend to eat 1/2 and bring the other 1/2 home. The restaurant is almost always low key and quiet. The service is good. The wine is ok."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai here though I have not had much of. This is amazing good. I had a walleye filet in hot curry with rice. Also a salmon sushi. REALLY good all of it. Great service also. I shall return indeed."}
{"text":"We went there after reading the review and we were not disappointed . The food was spicy and delicious.We ordered for expert spicy soup ,green curry and red curry.    Its not a big place but worth visiting for thai food."}
{"text":"I went here w/ my vegetarian brother and had the fried eggplant appetizer (perfectly fried and not greasy), crispy mock duck w/ basil (surprisingly crispy with good meaty texture, but lacking in duck flavor for me), and tofu pad woon sen (good helping of vegetables but the tofu was overcooked and the noodles too dry). Overall I think the food's better than average. Maybe my standards for Thai food are too high b/c I lived in Evanston (the \"dining capital of the North Shore\") where there were at least 4 great Thai restaurants nearby. The service is prompt and friendly, though the ambiance does feel a bit warehousish. I've heard from many friends here that Siam Terrace is the best Thai place in Champaign Urbana...I'll vouch for that (w/o trying the other Thai places) and emphasize the qualifier \"best...in Champaign Urbana.\""}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant four stars considering their outstanding walleye fish with chili sauce and tod mun fish cakes. Mouthwatering taste, ample serve size. However, this restaurants biggest problem is their consistency in several other items.  Greasy thai style pastas (pad thai), extra salt in fried catfish can sometime turn off your appetite. I will definitely be back but probably just for the spicy walleye fish."}
{"text":"Good pad Thai. Great prices.  Defiantly go to Thai place in CU for me."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and last night's service and food was so dismal its worth noting. I got the same dish I usually get, as did both my parents. None of the orders came out right and mine was not edible (I had six bay leaves in a bowl of soup for example). When we pointed out all the errors our waitress (who has been there at least a year and knows us) said the cook is new and she would tell him for next time. When she came back and I told her I couldn't eat mine, she said she would tell the owners (I asked not to be charged) but then came back and charged us full price with no explanation. We had planned to go back with family tomorrow, but will be making other arrangements."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here for the nTh time and it didn't disappoint. I got the Firecracker Chicken and it was simply amazing.  One thing to note is that if you like even slightly spicy food, then choose the spicy option as the regular spice levels are pretty low here. This is probably one of the best Asian places in Champaign."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Thai food. Pad kee mao is always my choice. It was spicy (level 4) and had plenty of veggies . The cheese Rangoon was surprisingly good. But the sticky rice and mango was disappointing.  I expected it to be a cold dessert. But it came out with hot and hard sticky rice. It seemed that the sticky rice was undercooked."}
{"text":"This is my 'go-to' place when it comes to ordering takeout in Champaign.  They have a large selection of Thai dishes but I almost always just get simple Pad Thai.  It's delicious and inexpensive and the staff is always very nice.  I've never had anything less than a great experience here."}
{"text":"I'm Thai. I grew up eating Thai food. I've worked at a couple of Thai restaurants. I know a good Thai restaurant when I see one.  My favorites: Pad See Ew, Prig Khing stirfry, Lava Trio, and Bangkok roll (it's a fancy sushi roll).  The price is pretty good for what you get. The service is consistently good, and the ambient is probably better than most Thai restaurants in town (love the red tin ceiling!)."}
{"text":"It serves decent Thai food... but food is really a hit or miss here.  It used to be better.  The service is a little lacking here.  I have waited 10 minutes before I could get a refill on my water.    And everytime I have gone, they have increased the tip on my credit card to their liking.  (I have gone to the credit card company and have reported them numerous times.. but it's just dissapointing they do that.)  If you like pad thai or curry.. I'd go to Golden Wok on University instead.  Bigger portions and more delicious.  If you want to try other things, this wouldn't be a bad place to go."}
{"text":"Food is really nice. Strongly recommend mango and glutinous rice. This is also a quiet place to talk. I will come here again."}
{"text":"The location is not perfect since the parking is inconvenient.  Sushi and sticky rice with mango is good. Their pad thai is too sour for me."}
{"text":"This place has great food. And they deliver! The food is always hot and fresh when it gets here. Plus the restaurant has good service."}
{"text":"Full agreement with the other posters - the food here is so very, very good.  As with most Thai restaurants, they are willing to make most things vegetarian by using tofu instead of meat, but they also have some dishes specifically made with tofu or mock duck (seitan) that are to die for.  Their mock duck with curry sauce... I lust after it."}
{"text":"We got the crab rangoon and spring rolls for an app and then split two of the veggie rice entrees...I think the seitan delight and veggie delight.  The crab was excellent, only complaint is that I wished there was more.  The spring rolls...not so hot.  I am used to shrimp and other veggies other than just lettuce and carrots.  The seitan and the veggie delight were both good, not excellent and we ordered them \"A R thai\" or something like that...I guess it means that it is the hottest.  Well, I wanted more SPICE!  Too bad we had it delivered and did not have access to the sauce.  Overall, not bad.  I also thought that the portion sizes were pretty small.  They brought them in the normal circle plastic things and they were like half full...I was disappointed in that.  Isnt getting asian take out known for leftovers for days....?"}
{"text":"Good solid Thai food.  None of their food particular makes this place stick out from the other thai places in the area, but this is a good place for a consistently good food in a pretty convenient location for those in Urbana."}
{"text":"As per my previous review, I used to like this place much better than my last few outings here.  My last three meals at this place have been nothing close to the 5 star rating I originally gave it.  Last time I went, my order came out wrong twice, finally being overly salted and dryed out.  The restaurant was also freezing inside... turn up your heater!   The two times before that, the food was just bland, overcooked, and not appetizing at all.  This used to be my favorite thai restaurant, but something changed, and I don't even care to go here anymore.  Something changed, and it wasn't for the better!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date or when your parents are in town. Inside has nice decor and polite staff. Between fried tofu for an appetizer,  Thai ice tea, any of their curry/ rice/ noodle dishes, and mango sticky rice for dessert, you can have a nice meal for a decent price, and have some leftovers for later. A good plan is to come with friends so you can try multiple dishes."}
{"text":"Ok so I did give Siam Terrace another shot and this time I felt was better.   We ordered delivery kind of late in the evening and it was pretty quick.  This time I got 2 appetizers for myself, the chicken satay and crab rangoons.  The satay wasn't bad, it was pretty much just marinated thai chicken on a stick with peanut dipping sauce.   I was overly impressed with the crab rangoons though! These were perfectly folded together and stuffed with a creamy, delectable filling! I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet and sour sauce that came with them too.  I'd say probably some of the best crab rangoons I've had yet in the CU area.  My only reservation would be the price, it seems Siam Terrace is still overall kind of pricey.  Will update next time we order from there!"}
{"text":"Love, love LOVE Siam Terrace. It is the best thai food I've ever had including when I lived in Chicago and visited Thailand! Their mock duck basil is expensive but worth it! Pad thai is also very good and the food is consistently good which is also important. Their weekday lunch specials are a good deal and will fill you up."}
{"text":"Something happened to this place ~2 years ago. It used to be, hands down, the best Thai in Chambana. Fresh, flavorful, etc. Then, a series of visits (at least 5) left me disappointed. I kept coming back because it's still probably the best in the area, but now that's not saying much. I hope they are back on the upswing."}
{"text":"I went there and I actually finished a plate of food. Hardly ever happens when I eat out. You can pick the degree of spiciness when you order. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"the best Thai food in town and I like how they deliver now.  Prices are not that steep and the food is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"I must recommend this joint!! I travel for a living so ordering delivery is like a crap shoot. Take the chance with this place. Pot stickers and seafood fried rice. Are you kidding me? Order it. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I definitely feel that the their strongest items are the fried rice dishes. The pad thai is way too sweet and the sushi is average at best."}
{"text":"I've only ordered one dish here, but I can't stray from it because it is so amazing.  MOCK DUCK BASIL. Order it, eat it, love it. One of the best vegetarian dishes ever."}
{"text":"AWESOME STIR FRY, AWESOME PAD THAI, AWESOME RICE...  and to top it all off, AFFORDABLE! :)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here but the atmosphere is kind of blah. Usually get the yellow curry or pad thai."}
{"text":"Great service, no waiting and friendly staff. I love how spicy the food can be by request without losing the great thai flavor. I recommend the fried banana if you like a little crunch"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not sure what the big deal about this place is.  So many people rave about it but every time I've been here I just feel totally and completely underwhelmed.  The food lacks flavor and soul.  There are times when the food is acceptable and other times when the food is actually borderline bad.  The exterior and interior both look a bit dingy and ragtag.  The service is fine but nothing to write home about.  Not somewhere I really go very often unless a friend insists.  There are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"This time sushi was unavailable which was sad but I had the curry with vegetables which was a smart choice for vegetable lovers! The curry was creamy and delicious and packed with veggies. I wonder if there's an option to add veggies and meat? They were also out of my favorite beer: Phuket.....I brought a coupon I found in the mail but with sushi being unavailable and the other requiring two entrees ordered, I couldn't use it."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've ever had.  Definitely a cut above the also amazing Basil Thai Urbana but also a bit more expense (you also have to tip here because they actually have servers unlike basil thai).  Nice atmosphere too, it would be a good place to bring a date.  I would highly recommend their tom kha gai soup and their mock duck curry (it's made of seitan)."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last night with two others. We ordered chicken egg rolls, chicken Pad Thai, duck basil, beef Pad See Ew, spicy fried rice and firecracker chicken. The egg rolls were okay. They were cooked to crispy, crunchy deliciousness, but the chicken inside was fairly bland. The sauce it was served with really saved it though. Personally, I LOVE pad Thai. It doesn't take much for me to absolutely enjoy every noodly bite, but the pad Thai here was really weak. It was really disappointing and overwhelmingly sweet. The pad see ew was ridiculous. It was so good. It may have been the best thing on the table! The flavor was on point and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The only thing that threw me off was that some of the broccoli were soggy. The duck basil was really quite nice, but it was drowning and carrots and there was a lack of sauce. The spicy fried rice was standard; it was pretty good but it didn't stand out. The firecracker chicken was really amazing but was upstaged by the duck. The complimentary miso soup was awful, but the waitress was pretty cool and let us switch it out for a salad, which was decent."}
{"text":"Went here is very good. I liked the food ramnook tofu was sweet and savory and on the lunch plate was only 7.50. I also had the 4 in 1 appetizer not worth the cost fish cakes, shrimp with noodles around it, crab rangoon, pot stickers with four different sauces. Two of which were sweet. Also, they dont have Siracha here so if you want it extra spicy you should ask. Recommend going there for lunch much cheaper."}
{"text":"This place is strange.   The fried rice has no egg and big tomato chunks  The Pad see u had American broccoli florets   It seems they want to be Thai restaurant, but don't seek out authentic ingredients. While the service was decent, the prices reasonable and the atmosphere standard, the food was a disappointment both in taste and presentation."}
{"text":"What's the fuss about this place? I really don't get it. Been here several times since 2007 and every time I visit, I end up leaving with this question in mind. I mean come on now... I am very outgoing person and this is not even my top 10 Thai food I have eaten in my list... Exaggerated..."}
{"text":"Pad Thai noodles were really delicious. Had a good sour n spicy taste. Thai fried rice on the other hand was just ok. Little on the sweeter end !"}
{"text":"Around 9:49 PM: \"Whoops. I was craving Thai, not whatever this \"crispy pad thai\" situation is. It's a pile of wafers. How is this a \"noodle\"? So disappointed.  The crab rangoon is good. I guess it'll be my lunch/dinner for the day/night. Somehow the four wontons don't seem to suffice; but close to nothing is better than a pile of cold wafers.\"  9:58 PM: I called to complain that it's under the \"noodles\" section, and whoever answered said, \"Yes. That's crispy pad thai.\" Uhh.. That's great; it's not a noodle dish though. Now I have a 10$ plate of cold wafers.  10:15 PM: *Edit from one star to four* \"Okay fine. Pouring the sauce on the cold wafers makes the wafer/chip situation 'better.' Still disappointed. Still think it should be under a different category. Also, I spilled the sauce on my leg. Not Siam terrace's fault, but I love complaining.\""}
{"text":"I worked here for Addy and Ratana back in 2010-2012. I became a Nursing Assistant and moved out of State. Telling you now this is the BEST thai food I've ever had. Even moving to Colorado several years ago. Have not found Thai food like this. Sushi is amazing, too!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review In my quest to eat at every restaurant, I have yet to find the perfect thai restaurant. This restaurant is tucked away in downtown Urbana. Unlike some of the other thai restaurants on campus, it is a sit down restaurant. Servers were friendly and attentive. There menu has the typical american thai food, but the specialty menu is where you can find the unique thai entrees. i unfortunately did not get to try any of them as my wife suggested I tried the thai mango curry. I subbed the shrimp for chicken. The entree did not take long to arrive. Portion sizes were excellent and the flavor profile was spot on. Prices are very good for what you get as well. I was disappointed that the curry was on the watery side. I got thai iced coffee and that was the best I have had since coming to Champaign  Pros: large portions, unique thai entrees  Cons: watery curry, NO LONGER DO THEY SERVE SUSHI  Hidden deals: Check for coupon mailer  Health code rating: C, the health ratings are atrocious for improper food temperature http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=748"}
{"text":"Went here to eat the other night and it was alright. Got a seat by the window and the atmosphere was nice on a Friday night. We ordered the N4 Pad See You and the Green Curry. The Pad See You was rather lukewarm, no steam rising from it and it felt as though it had been sitting there for a while. The curry was decent, though it wasn't all that flavorful. We did however get the Sticky Rice with Mango and that was the best part of the meal. Decent price with alright food makes it a nice place to stop in and try for yourself."}
{"text":"Now this is more like it! So far this is the best thai restaurant in C-U I have been to. I was a little wary of trying their sushi but I was not disappointed. Their tuna rolls were tasy but could have a little better assembled. Their service is good and I think they make an excellent Pad Se Eew and Pad Thai. I keep coming back and will definitely be one of my last stops before getting out of this town."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time. They're extremely accommodating should you want to make changes to the menu."}
{"text":"SOLID.  I have only been once but my pad see ew was delish! The noodles were cooked perfectly and I left full. My boyfriend is also a huge curry fan and he says that this place has probably the best in Champaign. We both love spicy food so this place was perfect! I'll be back!  EDIT: Had to knock off a star because I found a bug in my food. Super disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and get take out.  The mango and sticky rice dessert is f*cking awesome.  Everything else is okay."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Decent atmosphere. Worth trying. Sushi is the way to go, but the portions of the thai entrees are solid too."}
{"text":"This was my first time here (5/20/2015) and I went with a group (there were 9 of us).  I ordered the Mussamun Curry from the lunch menu and was VERY happy with the flavor, the amount, and the price.  The waitress accidentally forgot to put 2 of the orders in until much later (they showed up a minute or 2 after the rest of us had placed our orders).  But they ended up getting their food for free.  That's a pretty good compensation in my world!"}
{"text":"I like Siam Terrace, I do, and you can't go wrong with a pot of tom kha, but I really think the food at thara thai is better, and it's so much cheaper at thara thai I can't get worked up about siam terrace.  If I lived in Urbana, I would probably still go here alot, but I don't live in Urbana, so I've only been here twice in 4 years."}
