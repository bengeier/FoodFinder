{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place based on awesome reviews on their breakfast from friends and family, especially the French toast.  Finally stopped in this morning around noon for lunch and was kind of underwhelmed by the whole place.  Typical 15 to 20 minute wait for a table but noticed everything looked very classy, with white tablecloths and Specialty menus because of it being a Saturday. Talked to the waitress and she commented how they are trying a new thing with the specialty menus and going for a more decadent feel. Not really what I was looking for since I had two small kids with me, but we decided to give it a try anyway.  They did not have many options on the specialty menu for the children so we paid $16 for a waffle and chicken for them. We could get ala carte items on the side , so we ordered a side of scrambled eggs.  For the adults, we ordered the strip steak,  asparagus and gruyere scrambled eggs with hollandaise sauce.  Everything was delivered to our table and looked very well plated. The waitress was slow to fill our glasses and we never got our side of scrambled eggs. By the time they came we were basically done with our breakfast. The chicken and waffles was very tasty and the kids enjoyed it.  The steak and eggs was disappointing. It was two very small slivers of medium cooked steak, with a few half pieces of asparagus over the scrambled eggs. What was supposed to be hollandaise sauce looked more like a combination of egg yolks and butter. The taste wasn't awful, but for $22 a plate I guess I had higher expectations.  Overall it was not a terrible experience, however be prepared to know that you are ordering from specialty menus on the weekends and it is on the fine dining end of the spectrum. I was looking forward to having some great local French toast, so I guess I will keep looking."}
{"text":"This is just a fabulous little place.  Great food...always creative, well presented and delicious.  The service is wonderful.  We have made this our regular spot for Sunday Brunch before we attend Porthouse Theatre and it's always a treat.  Living in Chagrin Falls it's not on my beaten path, but we are making an effort to get there more often and it is always worth the effort."}
{"text":"Great service and decent food. For all the fanfare about this place I was a little disappointed with the cooking (grilled cheese and the crepes)."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Best kept secret in town. I have visited many times. Everyone is so friendly and they always find a way to seat us quickly. Last time I was there I ordered the hash and it was awesome, so tasty. I have never absolutely never been disappointed at the blue door. The croissants are so light, flaky and huge. A new favorite I have found is the hot cider. It is perfect on a cold winter morning. My family came to visit from out of state and they told me they want to come to the blue door every time they visit. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning with a friend and will definitely be going back!!! The Vegetarian Croissant Monsieur was wonderful paired with fresh fruit. Everything was fresh and well made. Would go back for the artisan breads alone! Absolutely brilliant!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy a lunch with my girlfriend. I ate Croissant sandwich with egg and it was delicious. I really love the texture of flaky croissant. Egg  tastes really good, too.  Staff are nice and inside of the cafe is nice. Just I wish they were in better location."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great fresh juices. Always busy, so be ready to wait, but worth it. A comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. We were taking a summer road trip to visit Cuyahoga Falls National Park and thanks to Yelp stumbled upon this gem of a breakfast spot. If we were in a bigger city, there would definitely be a line around the block and prices would be doubled. Instead, we arrived for Sunday brunch, sat in a comfortable booth and spent too long trying to decide what to order. We enjoyed delicious house coffee, and settled on eggs benedict and challah french toast. (Local, free-range eggs, organic butters, homemade english muffins and challah!) Both were delicious. We also spied the gentleman next to us eating the homemade granola with yogurt and fruit and we wishing we could have ordered that as well. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't stay away from the amazing pastry case. We bought a plain and almond croissant for the road (and a lemon turnover too), as just as Harold F. mentioned, they envied pastries we had in Europe. Hope to be back again soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here during a visit to the area.  The d√©cor was rustic/chic - very nice.  The service was warm, helpful and knowledgeable. The place was busy but we were never rushed. Based on other reviews, my husband had the corned beef hash and it definitely delivered.  I had a very tasty traditional breakfast - the highlights were the bacon and the house made English muffins. The locally sourced organic coffee was exceptional.  My only disappointment was that I didn't order a croissant - they looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Mad props!!! Feel the love & dedication with every bite. Congrats to chef Jimmy!!"}
{"text":"What a gem! I have been here many times and my meal is delightful every time. The menu is always changing so you can expect something unique and of the highest quality with every visit."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service.  After ordering we waited 15 minutes without getting the any of the decaf, hot chocolate, or cinnamon roll we ordered.  I never got a refill on my coffee.  When the waiter came out to say they didn't have the entree I ordered, we left.   The food looked, sounded, and smelled great, but unless someone brings some of it, it's just a tease."}
{"text":"After reading all the wonderful reviews for The Blue Door Cafe and living only three minutes away, my daughter and I went there for breakfast this morning and loved our delicious crepes with lemon cream filling with fresh fruit and slivered almonds!  (See posted picture.)  We will definitely be back to try more items from their menu!"}
{"text":"The Golden Goose has new ownership and is now The Blue Door.  We were visiting from Virginia...stopped to have coffee and a chocolate croissant (as good as any we've eaten in Paris) and were so impressed decided to return for lunch.  Excellent tomato soup, great BLT although husband would have prefered the bacon to be crispier (he didn't request that , however, and some of us like our bacon less crispy than others).  The flavor of the bacon was superb.  I ordered a grilled cheese...excellent cheese, but the challah bread was simply too thick...make the same sandwich but with much thinner slices of bread...the fruit and  salad greens sides served with the orders were wonderful.  We then returned a few days later for brunch/lunch...very crowded, but we were seated relatively quickly (staff passing out tastes of pastries made the wait far more enjoyable).  Excellent omlet served with a tasty potato side, good bacon and eggs with an English muffin and a most amazing chicken salad croissant.  When I told our daughter to taste the chicken salad, her response was \"I don't do things like chicken salad\" but after tasting this one, she admitted she might just change her mind.  Salad was nicely flavored with tarragon and tossed in a light mayo dressing...absolutely excellent...again the fruit side was perfect with the sandwich...can't wait to visit Cuyahoga Falls again and eat at The Blue Door..."}
{"text":"This place is like you died and went to foodie heaven!! I've always ordered off the specials and I've never been disappointed. An absolute must try place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I love this little gem. It is always crazy busy, but it's well worth the chaos. The food is amazing and the menu always has something new to try. The staff is super kind and friendly. The atmosphere is fun and energetic. I've been eating here for years and I've never had a bad experience. And omg the food, it's seriously always incredible. I would probably wait for over a half hour to be seated here, the food is just that tasty. That said, despite the fact that they are always slammed, I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table. Plus the bakery is on par. I've never had a better English muffin in my entire life. I leave with a bag of them from the bakery ever time I eat there. If you are looking for a unique menu filled with fresh and innovative dishes look no further, Blue Door is the place for you."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by The Golden Goose/The Blue Door. I'm not clear on why the name change occurred, but the sign outside today prominently says \"The Golden Goose.\"  The menus say \"The Blue Door.\"  We drove up on a rainy day; it may have been the weather, but the exterior did not look promising.  The menu was interesting, though, with a broad range of sweet and savory breakfasts.  I ordered shrimp and grits, the person I was with ordered an omelet.  When our food arrived, we discovered a fried potato thing (kind of like a hash brown, but rather thick,) which I immediately ordered.  Shrimp and grits were great, potato thing was wonderful.  Service was fine without hovering.  Pastries look fantastic, I'll head back for some tomorrow.  I wish I was here longer so I could try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Sometimes it's really busy, which is understandable since it is really great, so you have to wait a bit to be seated. But once seated, the staff is really helpful and nice. Their food is great, and of pretty high quality. You have to get there early if you want to try their quiche, which, I haven't got there in time. But their English muffins are homemade and are so tasty! Their coffee is really good, I don't drink coffee but I've been told this by a few of my friends who also go there, it's from Angel Falls Caf√© in Akron. I can't say enough about how great this place is and how much I love their food! Try it out sometime. And make sure to try their English muffins!"}
{"text":"Best place in akron. Staff is wonderfully friendly... They are on it!!! So hard to get used to people who actually give a shi\"!!!! Pastries are beautiful. Place is clean.  Food is perfect, fresh , local.. Just can't say enough......"}
{"text":"Chocolate brownie made me cry!  If you have a group larger than 5 people, I would strongly recommend either calling in advance or expect a significant wait."}
{"text":"As much as I want this to be a tremendous place to enjoy lunch with my family and friends...and as much as I want to agree with just how much everyone else is enamored with the concept of the Blue Door...I'm  going to finally have to be honest. This is probably my 10th time visiting the Blue Door and as with the other nine times I found the meal Overrated, Overpriced, and to put it simply...Terrible. This time I brought my family of four in and per the waiters resounding recommendation.. I ordered the Chicken Fricassee... It was $16 so I assumed it must be something very special...it was special all right...mainly because I did not realize that canned \"chicken aka king\" was still commercially available...it was literally inedible. My partner ordered homemade Chorizo sausage in a blanket and was presented with two ordinary hotdogs wrapped in crescent roll...when I called the waiter over to inform him that I did not expect to pay $14 for two hotdogs he said \"oh no ...they are sausage ...and I said \"oh no they are two hotdogs\" and he smiled and said \"well yeah...they're hotdogs\". This dish was of course also served with a minuscule portion of spoiled coleslaw. My daughter's $11 waffle could have been edible if it had not been covered in a most upsetting/unrecognizable sauce. Bottom line, my son's $10 bacon and eggs were the best part of the meal. I have no problem paying top dollar for food ...even slightly above average food ...but this food could not even be called average. It was truly sub par...THERE WILL NOT BE AN 11th try for me. I hope you and I do understand that there are not a lot of suppose it upscale places to dine in that area...but in my view...a fast food chain would be a better food choice."}
{"text":"Bravo, Blue Door Cafe!   My fianc√© and I enjoyed a leisurely brunch here this morning before heading home to Pittsburgh, and we could not have been more pleased with our experience.   I ordered the Monte Cristo Crepe, and my fianc√© ordered the Bacon Egg Croissant. Both were excellent! The croissant in particular was out of this world good - so flaky and buttery. Yum!   We shared a side of bacon which was cooked perfectly, and also a side of breakfast potatoes with caramelized onions.  Also very good!   Oh! And I loved my mimosa. The service was great, too. I wish I could remember what our waitresses name was. If you're reading this, thank you!   If we find ourselves in the area again, we'll absolutely be back. Thanks again Blue Door!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is ah-mazing! The atmosphere is really cool. Wes is awesome. Definitely worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic, wonderful food and service!! First time for us to eat here we really enjoyed the Sunday Brunch so much. I do recommend making reservations thankfully we did, it was 12:30 and very busy. We didn't know what to expect when we arrived, just a small gray building no sign to state this was the cafe except for the blue door. We are not from the area and hoped we had the right place. It is small and cramped inside, everyone is pretty much on top of each other when it's busy. The hostess was very friendly, we arrived a little early and had to wait a few minutes for a table, we sat on a bench next to the bakery the hostess told us they bake everything fresh daily. Everything looked delicious!! When we sat at our table it was comfortable even with being busy we seemed like we were in a good spot. Our server was great very knowledgeable and friendly. She explained the items on the menu. She was very attentive and made us feel welcome. The food was superb really very good!! We go to brunch at different places often and this place by far is top notch. We will definitely be back! I highly recommend trying this place!!  The place was clean, unfortunately only one bathroom for women and the bathrooms are close to the eating areas. I didn't like that so much. Also, a little on the pricey side for everything. Still a yummy place to try."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here it blows my mind how good the food is.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  I'm always amazed when I come on a Saturday how well they handle a busy place like this.  You would expect to wait for a while with the crowd here but they handle it perfect.   The bread is worth buying as well."}
{"text":"We just celebrated our 35th  anniversary here and wow how can you say fabulous?  Both food and service were superb. After having breakfast here I was expecting a lot and they just blew right past them.  From duck foie gras to Hawaiian sea bass to chocolate souffle,  everything was beautifully prepared and a feast for both my eyes and mouth.  Can't day enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"My husband, dog, and I were driving across country and stopped there for a quick breakfast a week ago.  Not only are the bakery items outstanding but the staff was so friendly and they loved our dog!  Even gave her a little bacon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! we go once a month and try at least one new dish each time. So far every meal has been a delight. This is one of the best places to go for breakfast/ brunch in the area.   Servers a very knowedgeable about the ingrediants used and the passion for quality seems to carry throughout the staff.   The one opportunity they need to resolve is how to pay for the meal. Be prepared to stand at the counter in a bit of a disorganized mob in order to pay."}
{"text":"We were hungry and there was a line, so we got the ham-and-cheese-stuffed croissant from the mini-bakery counter while we waited. Then when we sat down, the most attractive things on the menu to us that day were the Croissant Monsieur (ham and cheese, with bechemel sauce and an added fried egg on top) and the Monte Cristo (ham, turkey, and cheese on challah French toast). All the ingredients are local, which may have been why those 15 minutes it took me to inhale my food were pure heaven. I got the mixed greens on the side, and my boyfriend got the fruit side dish. Holy cow, get the fruit. Usually fruit side dishes are pineapple and mellon and a few strawberries. This one was virtually all berries -- straw, black, blue, rasp. Needless to say, we went all in with the ham dishes, and I am not disappointed in the least. As savory as you can get, and did I mention the ingredients are all local? As per usual, boyfriend preferred one dish -- Monte Cristo, because he loves all things French toast -- and I preferred the other -- Croissant Monsieur. I found the Monte Cristo a little dry, while the Croissant had the moistness of the buttery croissant as well as the fried egg on top to make it my perfect breakfast. Brunch. Lunch."}
{"text":"We were visiting from California, and would like these folks to please open out here!  First, the restaurant.  It is relatively no frills, with pleasant service.  The prices were great, and in addition to some basics, they had some bakery inspired items, like a brioche bread pudding, which was outrageously good.    But most importantly, the bakery!  Michael Bruno, a former Marine, is the baker.  He has a booth up by the front register with amazing European style pastries, and his goodies are there Wednesday through Sunday.  He is an artist.  You meet people every now and then in life who endeavor to do something as well as they possibly can, and he has applied such a passion to baking.  When we first visited, he came out and walked us through not only every item in the case but how he made it, ingredients, etc.  They were beautiful pastries, and he tries to stay with a natural, minimalist approach to ingredients.  We had a giant cinnamon twist that was delicate and delicious; a croissant that was infused with lemon curd that was beautiful to look at and tasted incredibly fresh; an obscenely large sticky bun type pastry that had so many delicate layers of dough in it that we had to take a picture; and a chocolate croissant that was worthy of ones we've had in Europe. Go for the restaurant, but come back for the bakery!  When we visit Ohio again, whether we are in the area or not, we'll find our way back for these treats."}
{"text":"The Golden Goose is a gem for breakfast in Cuyahoga Falls. I order the fabulous spinach, portobella, and feta quiche. My husband often orders the country fried steak. The service is fast and friendly. Prices are good for quality food. I can't wait to try their baked goods someday if I can ever bring myself to say no to the quiche!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Blue Door several times times, and each time, I think \"this will be the time when I finally understand the hype!\" Alas, I think I'm just not enough of a foodie to enjoy the dishes. The pastries are gorgeous, and I am impressed by their commitment to locally- and/or carefully-sourced foods, but after paying top-dollar (well...top-dollar for Akron, anyway) for items including an over-salted croque madame, a tomato soup that that was very heavy on the balsamic vinegar, and lackluster mixed greens, I think Blue Door and I just aren't made for each other."}
{"text":"Menu is great for breakfast/ brunch. It's like a diner, but with excellent food. Local and organic options.   Service was excellent. Friendly, genuine and quick. Again,  excellent service.   First visit and first impression... highly recommend! Looking forward to our next visit.   (This might be my first 5 star review.)"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite brunch place.the food quality is high but with the new chef the place menu has become pretentious.no grilled cheese anymore or French toast."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic dinner spot! They have had amazing breakfast and lunch offerings for several years, but just recently added dinner service. I highly recommend the tasting menu! Amazing flavors, great presentation and first-class service!! Foodies - you must try!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot. Great service staff, amazing food and friendly atmosphere. We had the cherries jubilee french toast and the quiche Loraine. Both were fantastic. Fresh orange juice was also perfect. Thanks for a great fathers day brunch!"}
{"text":"First off, the world should know the bacon they serve is the same as the bacon in the White House so you know it's tasty lol. It's about 5 bucks for 2 pieces but totally worth it. Don't leave without having a potato croquette. My only gripe is they need a large dining space and better location."}
{"text":"Oh. So. Good. Excellent menu with unique dishes that are a beautiful blend of flavors. Fresh juices. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Gourmet at its best. Very nice outside porch area to sit and eat with friends."}
{"text":"I doubt you could have something off of their menu that is less than mouth-watering...I've certainly yet to!  What a treat when I am traveling through town and I can stop by.    Only problem is sometimes there is a wait...the secret is out."}
{"text":"Good but pricy.  Not up to the 4 star rating. Corn beef hash was good but not exceptional. The English muffin was just ok and lacked butter.  They didn't top off the coffee. The special double layer French Toast was burnt on the bottom but good in the middle.  Would not recommend for the price. The tab for three came to $50."}
{"text":"Dined outside on the patio for Saturday brunch. The food was phenomenal! Our server was excellent, genuinely engaging and gave us a lot of history on Chef Schulz. Very relaxing experience."}
{"text":"Food is lovely. Service is nice. It's a little bit pricy but well worth it! Every dish is well displayed."}
{"text":"Great local business ! Food is amazing and  family friendly atmosphere! Baked goods are so fresh!"}
{"text":"Last week thought I would never be back here but a friend really craved trying it. So back ai went - too bad. $50 for a breakfast for two this time, a bathroom that was beyond positively scary, servers that do not seem to care, dirty chairs/table/floor, super long wait to be seated and then to add insult to injury a long wait to pay the bill at the front counter. Needless to say won't be back."}
{"text":"The place is small and the service is friendly but very slow and forgetful... That is all I can say that is bad. The owner/baker is very friendly and goes around the tables and truly cares about what his customers think. Besides being friendly, the guy can cook. Their Eggs Benedict is some of the best I've ever had. The same can be said about their granola, french toast, and quiches.   The food is amazing and I always end spending way more than I plan to be"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love fresh ingredients made with love?! Because that's how blue door makes their food. I simply love their breakfast menu. The only baked goods I tried was their yummy, decadent, soft croissants! The cr√™pes are my favorite. The menus are constantly changing so you never know what you gonna get until you eat there yourself.  One time, I had the \"organic\" fruit crepe with strawberries and bananas with their cream sauce, which was mouth watering. The other time, the tiramisu cr√™pe was the highlight of my day. I eat here mostly for breakfast. I had the chorizo and Mexican cheese. It's not the chorizo I'm used to eating back home in Cali so that didn't suit my taste buds. Also, I had the corned beef hash which was the probably the best one I've ever had. I had corned beef hash at other breakfast joints and this one is by far the best. However, beware of the long wait, it definitely takes a while for a table but worth the wait. They take reservations now!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Solid service. Always busy and that's a testimonial to the consistent quality. Favorite dish is the corned beef hash and any of the daily specials. Plan on taking something home from the bakery on the way out.  Everything is as locally sourced, organic and natural as possible, thus the pricing. They honor their ingredients well. No artificial sweeteners for coffee or tea as well.  Only gripe is that you have to wait in the same line as the bakery patrons when paying your check. Prepare for a usual wait on weekends but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Just tried the Blue Door Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Super crowded but worth the wait.  Best corned beef hash ever!  The homemade jam was superb as was the freshly made English muffin.   No sign, but you can't miss the blue building and full parking lot.  Can't wait to go back and try their lunch or bring home some baked goods."}
{"text":"We just moved to Cuyahoga Falls and I cannot say how excited I am this place is right around the corner. It's an excellent date night spot as well as a nice breakfast restaurant! It's pricey but truly worth every penny. Their orange juice is fresh squeezed and AMAZING. We also went here for Mother's Day brunch and were treated to an excellent array of breakfast and brunch items (organic waffle with fresh cream? Yes please!). Friendly service, superb food and a cozy little atmosphere. We could not have picked a better city to live in! Can't wait to see what other gems are hidden here!"}
{"text":"The short review: excellent food and excellent service! Definitely recommend to anyone. We liked the omelet better than the chicken and waffles.   My girlfriend and I came to the Blue Door Cafe on September 10th, 2017 for a late breakfast / brunch after multiple recommendations from friends. We came in around 2:00 PM, so the restaurant was not very packed (as it normally is). Ben, our server, gave us excellent service and the food was spectacular.   I had the chicken and waffles. I expected the waffles to be thicker, like a Belgium waffle, but they were thinner. Also, the chicken was chicken tenders and not bone-in chicken (as I was expecting after living in the south for so long). The flavors mixed well and the meal was definitely good (chicken and waffles 4 out of 5 stars).   My girlfriend had the chili omelet, and she won the meal of the day. The balance of flavors was spectacular and the plate was very large! She was unable to finish her portion. The mixture of flavors was absolutely perfect and we especially appreciated the meat on top. The omelet was more like an inside-out omelet because most of the toppings were on top or on the side, rather than inside the eggs - but it made for a perfect brunch dish.   The coffee was good, and I had a seasonal hot cider drink that was also very yummy (with a cinnamon stick). The bacon was also delicious but had a heavy smoke flavor - which I love and my girlfriend is not a fan of. The house-made sausage was delicious.   The building itself could maybe use some new paint on the inside walls, but it was a clean and welcoming atmosphere. They played great music at a reasonable volume (we could hear the music and had no trouble speaking to each other).   Overall, the combination of great service and high-quality food earned this place 5 stars from both of us! We definitely recommend. I have heard that it gets very busy in the mornings, so I cannot speak for the service then but if it was anything like what we had it will still be excellent."}
{"text":"I'm aways happy to support conscious food, especially local and organic which we don't have enough of in this area.  3 out of four of our party got different meals for brunch and they were all excellent. Pleased with gluten-free options and the coffee and fresh-squeezed juice were delicious!  I read some reviews complaining about the cost but I disagree with those comments.  I thought the prices completely fair and reasonable. Local and organic food costs more because it is more costly to produce. It's important to me to eat organic - consuming foods that are pesticide, antibiotics and hormone free and if needed, I'm happy to pay a little extra for it.  I'll definitely be back Blue Door.  And hoping to be surprised with some GF pancakes on the menu next time! Thanks for the great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great local food!  I love the croissant with egg.  It is nice to have the option of having a salad for breakfast (the dressing is perfect).  The pecan cinnamon rolls are mouth watering.  The staff is friendly and welcoming even when it is packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Bread is amazing.  Staff is nice and friendly and been great about greeting immediately.   5 stars isn't enough."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT here !!! Prices are more than your average breakfast, but so are the flavors, style, and quality of food. Most everything is fresh, local, and baked goods are made in house. I personally never had poor service in my more than three times visiting, but I have seen some servers be less than attentive to patrons. The cafe does get filled up at peak hours and you can expect to wait sometimes for a seat, but it is usually always worth it. This would be my preferred breakfast stop everyday if I could afford it."}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Blue Door and were all very pleased. I like that everything is fresh, local if possible, and fairly unique. Everything was delicious. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here several times for the brunch menu - always excellent! We went last night for the dinner service and were not disappointed!  Food: Everything we had was wonderful! Lots of attention to detail, unique ingredients and flavors. The menu changes weekly and they use the freshest ingredients possible - and it definitely comes across on the plate! They also accomodate for vegetarian and gluten free dietary restrictions - each course had at least one option.  We started with a freshly baked bread plate - baguette, brioche,and a gluten fee Irish soda bread served with a housemade honey butter - all great. Our meal began with a peach salad and an albacore tuna salad. The peach salad had dried peaches, fresh slices, and a peach pastry - not overly sweet. The tuna dish had tuna confit, tartare, and pan-seared tuna. We both had the duck foie gras - yum! It had pan seared foie gras, a duck and plum mousse between two crisps (like butter!), and a small plum pastry. For entrees, I had a smoked salmon dish with \"seasoned quark\" which was explained as a mix between a sour cream and cottage cheese. Not the greatest description, perhaps, as I wasn't sure what to expect on my plate, but it was a slightly tart, creamy sauce under the salmon. And the smokiness of the salmon was perfect! My boyfriend had a duck breast & thigh dish - fantastic as well (he even shared a bite!). For dessert, I had a fruit dish that was beautiful. Three small squares of frozen fruit (apricot, raspberry, and blueberry), similar to a small square of a fruit popsicle, each with an accompanying sauce and pieces of fruit. My boyfriend ordered the cheese souffl√©, which was ordered by most tables, and was light and fluffy and so good!  Service: Our server was a girl named Niko (not sure on spelling), who was extremely friendly and answered any questions we had. There was also a gentleman server, a female hostess, and another man who brought out plates. No, the place wasn't packed, but everyone took a part in the tables. The owner Mike came around to talk to every table, asking for feedback. One of the chefs personally served the cheese souffl√©. One \"fine dining\" touch that I have only had happen at a restaurant in New York City that I thought was incredible was when one server came by and scraped the bread crumbs from our table. It's little touches like that which can enhance one's dining experience.  We enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at Blue Door! There was a slightly longer wait than anticipated between two of the courses, but the dinner service hasn't been running that long - these are normal kinks that get worked out over time. We have no complaints and absolutely cannot wait to return for dinner and brunch!"}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype...over priced, not much of a selection and the coffee was ice cold!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best brunch in Northern Ohio. I love the corned beef hash, eggs and the best English muffin ever! Bistro inspired vibe, friendly service, sophisticated but homey. Must visit!"}
{"text":"We went to the Blue Door for brunch and had a wonderful time. Our server was friendly and attentive. Gave great suggestions for which pastries to try! The food was delicious, and we loved the tea! We will definetly be back to enjoy brunch again!"}
{"text":"This place is so good the food is so good and everything is so good and the service is so good. Six brunches, and all were excellent.  Even the kids want to come back.  Get the corned beef and hash!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to the Blue Door Cafe twice in the last two weeks. Marble top tables, bent wood chairs(Remember the 70s) a few booths and some pleasant outdoor seating. You might think you're on a country cafe in France, Italy, Spain...you get the idea. Don't make any loud noise as it might startle the millenials in what is their natural habitat. Our waiter both times was Kyle, who is perfect in this kind of restaurant. First time I had hash with two eggs(sadly they don't poach) and a house made croissant. My DC had a croissant with eggs, bacon, and a quac concoction, which she enjoyed. Second time I had a hot brown with a very rich tomato wine soup, and a fruit cup. As with everything, they put their own spin on the hot brown, and it is superb. I owned a restaurant in Kentucky...home of the hot brown. My own hot brown was laden with bechemel and pretty heavy. I like the Blue Door 's better. Our third DC had eggs, bacon and a croissant, which she enjoyed. This is kind of a field to fork place, and they do it very well. Not cheap, but worth the price. Hope you will try it."}
{"text":"The Blue Door is hands down some of the best food in the greater Cleveland/Akron area. Yes,  they serve primarily brunch with an unmatched level of care for not only preparation but for sourcing the best ingredients the Great Lakes region has to off. For example, their seemly simple strawberry lemonade was crafted with local strawberries and hand juices organic lemons; you could just feel how proud the owner was when he told me this. I am proud to patronize the Blue Door and will continue to give them 100% of my support."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  I'd go here once a week if I didn't live in California.    We were here for a wedding last weekend and needed a good breakfast spot in the area.  Thank you fellow Yelpers for helping us find the Golden Goose.  Wesley let us know that their food is organic, fresh, their breads are homemade, the eggs were hatched that morning, etc.  We all ordered different things: The Monte Cristo, bacon and eggs, the German sausage platter and whatever their Latin inspired omelette is called.  We all loved every single bite so much so there wasn't much left on our plates.  Even though we were happily full, we had to buy some homemade English muffins and chocolate covered/filled flaky croissants to go.  Aside from the tasty food,  the service was top notch, the decor simple but cozy.  I just wish they had more of these types of restaurants in San Diego."}
{"text":"I am upset. I drove 35 minutes to get here and now I'm going to want to make this drive every day. This place is ridiculously delicious. Come here."}
{"text":"Wow!  best breakfast place ever!  Upon arriving, my first thought was, \"it will do, I'm sick of looking for a place.\"  But, once we walked in and looked at the menu, we realized that this was no ordinary breakfast diner.  We were seated by a young girl and quickly realized that the owner in a white chef's coat who was checking on his guests, had his children working there.  The boy, as a bus boy and the girl as a hostess.  Quite nice I thought, and homey.    Then we realized most of the food was locally grown and organic.    I had an omelette with anduelle sausage, sweet corn and  goude cheese.  Best melt in my mouth omelette I've EVER had.  Wow!    If I lived in Ohio, I would def. make this a regular spot for me..  AMAZING!!  And Cheap."}
{"text":"The Golden Goose is a favorite. We go at least twice a month. On weekends, they make their own English muffins, which are worth the small up-charge. All of the ingredients are fresh, and when possible, local (according to the write-up on the back of their menu). I have an incredibly difficult time ordering anything except the quiche. It is about 3 inches tall and fan-freaking-tastic, usually available in two flavors. I love the feta/spinach one; it comes with either a spring mix salad or fresh fruit.   My cohort always gets breakfast. The sausage links are highly recommended, as well as the challah bread french toast with creme fraiche and fruit.  There is a European bakery inside as well. The often give out samples, which are so so good. The brownie is incredibly rich and the prices are reasonable.  It's kind of ridiculous, really, that this place is just a small, unassuming building on State Road. This is the place to go for breakfast in Cuyahoga Falls.  Update: I just found out that on Sundays they have the most amazing homemade crepes. We had the gorgonzola, caramelized apples and ham crepe and the organic yogurt, lingonberry and chantilly cream one. So yummy."}
{"text":"Great find - thanks, Yelp! Fabulous brunch spot that can definitely compete with my favorites in NYC.   We had the veggie croissant Monsieur and the French toast and both were really good, and the pastries in the bakery case looked amazing.   Service was very friendly and provided recommendations. Also, the head chef was refilling the pastry case on the way out and asking people how their meals were - great to see that level of engagement.   Only complaint is that the menu was a little more skewed to lunch side - the French toast was the only sweet option (besides the pastries)  We'll definitely go back if we're ever back in Akron!"}
{"text":"Came here from Cleveland on a referral from a friend. Totally worth the drive, and the 30 minute wait. Had incredible challah French toast topped with peaches, pecans strawberries and cream. And a side of the ridiculous bacon. All of it was crazy good. Kids enjoyed bacon & eggs and the Croissant Monsieur (ham & gruyere with a fried egg on large croissant). Clean plates all around.   The owner realized how far we'd come and made sure to check on us a couple of times. Great (fast!) service and a fun atmosphere. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Some of the best croissants we've ever had. The vegetarian Croque Monsieur is delicious. The crepes were beautifully thin and flavorful.   Wish the place was closer to where we lived :("}
{"text":"Worse corn beef hash! I have been coming here for almost 3 years now and they recently changed the menu along with a new chief in town. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Worth the price. Fun atmosphere. They have limited hours, and it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"i had to edit my review. i used to love this place. for a long time i would eat here 2+ times a week. then torsten came along and sabotaged the menu so he could do his overpriced dinner b.s. secondly, i am friends with many of the servers and some of the old kitchen staff. all i hear about all the time now is how they are getting screwed with a new pay structure. sorry, but this is not cool.  i will never come here again. jimmy was the best thing you had going for your breakfast menu but you traded him up for a douchey, over-rated german a-hole. im not impressed.. he can take that michellin star and cram it where the sun dont shine. so sad. michael, check your rating trends on here... looks to me like you're nose diving."}
{"text":"Great grommet type food. Great menu. A little pricey for lunch and breakfast otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast/brunch spot! There's nothing else like this place in the area. The cafe uses many high-end, organic and local ingredients. Don't expect a greasy diner breakfast. The prices are higher but match the quality of food. There's a regular menu and several daily specials that are based on what's in season. On a recent visit I had the ricotta cheese pancakes with Ohio peaches and raspberries, toasted almonds and creme chantilly. No syrup was needed. The pancakes were decadent and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My husband ordered the Tartine (crepes with fruit, nutella, preserves and creme chantilly). We shared the potato croquette, which was so wonderful that I'm going to be adding this to every order from now on. And their Nueske's bacon is super thick and by far the best bacon I've ever had. I wish I could eat here everyday but I'd be a lot poorer and fatter!"}
{"text":"Great endeavor with local offerings, however food was average- nothing special. Arrogant attitude from the wait staff, that seemed truly butt-hurt that I did not feel it was the best meal I have ever had. After not kissing his arse over the average food, tattoo-boy server-  (very classy btw) seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. Wait staff seems to have all gravitated here after they bled out Borders by hanging and using free wi fi without spending any money.  Now they all needed to find jobs and found themselves here. Get over yourselves- nice concept, nice food, but you did not reinvent the wheel. Lose the attitude."}
{"text":"Had a charcuterie sandwich on brioche.  The meat was complemented very well by a fig jam and melted cheese.  Very good meal and kind of surprised to find such a progressive menu in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"We have been to The Blue Door for lunch/brunch several times and enjoyed each one. This was our 3rd visit to The Door as part of their Dinner Service.  Each dinner visit has been very good and this one may have been the best of the 3.   The food is always wonderfully unique for the area in its variety and preparation.  Especially when combined with the cafe's more casual environment.   Each course has been excellent but I especially appreciate the sauces that the Chef uses to complete each plate. The recent addition of wine pairings added beautifully to the meal.    I see The Blue Door as a local gem and hope to continue to visit often in the future."}
{"text":"Blue Door Cafe now. Fancy food by a high end Chef. Served in a low/middle class area using a decrepid building. The menu read like a French restaurant you would see in Beachwood not Cuyahoga Falls. I was looking for a normal breakfast at a normal price. Instead I got two pancakes for $9.00. I was seated at a combo booth/table with another couple. If you are a foodie and don't mind sitting at a table with 1990's advertising and you think christmas lights on the wall is good decoration, then this is your place."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for breakfast / brunch and have always left feeling like I had an incredible meal, but tonight was the first time we went for dinner. It was easily one of the best meals I have ever had.  My sincere thanks and compliments to the chef and all other staff at the Blue Door for a wonderful experience.  Best of luck to the chef as he moves on to other adventures."}
{"text":"Simply the best and no one else is even close. This place is in its own category. The Blue Door will ruin other breakfast/brunch spots for you-beware. My only complaints are that its not open early in the week and that its becoming more popular, to the point where there's usually a wait for a table on the weekend."}
{"text":"Normally one of my favorite breakfast destinations which is why I was especially disappointed when my partner and I brought 3 people to visit last weekend. We waited to be seated for nearly an hour. Apparently when you have a group of 5 or more, there are only 2 tables they can use - even though, as I pointed out to a waitress, if you put a 4-top and a 2-top together, we could've been seated within 15-20 minutes. Rather than inconvenience a few parties, they chose to keep us waiting for almost an hour, as customer after customer walked in and were seated immediately. Now, a loyal customer, who always raved about the food, and tried to introduce as many people as possible, will probably never visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious, amazing, and delightful decor. I've tried several of the dishes and the food has always been amazing! The food is fresh and locally sourced whenever possible. Their bakery items are out of this world."}
{"text":"The wait was a little longer than anticipated but the food is entirely worth the wait."}
{"text":"always so creative and you can tell all the food is made fresh to order, they use local ingredients and the menus change weekly. Very busy though but thats a good indicator that it's a great place to eat and support!"}
{"text":"Well lets just say not as good as the reviews. We have stop here 3 times first 2 did not want to wait 3rd time we waited a short time and were seated ordered our breakfast my wife had the eggs with bacon I had the eggs with hash.If you like eating charcoal and washing it down with cold coffee you will love this place. Plenty of other good places for breakfast in the area this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I've been going here since, well I actually stopped by even before they opened, and the owner Michael came out and enthusiastically told me what it was all about. The only potential downside is a slightly high price and funky hours, but honestly, I don't mind at all and it just reflects a sincere specialness to the place. Easily some of the best food in NE ohio and possibly the best bakery. If you go at night on the weekend, dinner is fairly pricey but I'd argue very fair for what you get, especially relative to what you'd pay for that kind of meal elsewhere. It's truly top notch stuff. Also, the staff is fun and after a number of visits it really feels like a chummy, local place. The whole restaurant is a real gem for so many reasons and the first place I think of taking visitors. If you are in the area, you really should do yourself a favor and eat there."}
{"text":"Fantastic unique breakfast and lunch menu you will find nowhere else. Good personal service and the bakery items are decadent. Must go."}
{"text":"What a find thanks to Yelp! I'm not sure how they pulled off \"diner meets French bakery\" but they did. I went on a Sunday around 11:00 and waited for 15 minutes or so for a table for two. We expected to wait so that way okay by me. The atmosphere is hustle and bustle with extremely friendly staff and nice clean and simple look. The food is a little pricey for breakfast, but it reflects the wholesome ingredients they use from Snowville Creamery (local) to homemade croissants and English muffins! To die for. I'm a vegetarian and will occasionally eat egg and am very picky about it. Theirs were perfect with spinach and Gruyere cheese on a homemade croissant. Yum! Definitely fit for foodies!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing breakfast or lunch place.   I can't believe it's not talked about all over town.  I actually hope it doesn't too get well known as it might lose its  simple decor.  The specials  for the day were scrumptious and are on par with my favorite brunch  location in Georgetown area of D.C.   Highly recommend and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not really sure how to review this place.  They did have 3 vegan options for lunch today...a $5 cup of soup, a $13 amaranth salad and a $15 \"salsifyed carrots\" dish.  I asked about the carrots.  The menu said grits, basil and Meyer lemons.  I asked the server what else was in it.  \"Ummm, I think that's about it.\"  I am not eating $15 grits with a squeeze of lemon and a basil leaf.  So I ordered the salad.  It was swimming in dressing!  It was so overly dressed that the greens were limp.  All of my meat eating friends left at least half of their plates behind.  (Bacon and eggs, one frittata and two plates of cornbeef hash were all less than desirable. )  We waited at least 25 minutes after we finished for our check to arrive.  Breakfast/lunch for 5 came in at over $75 when a few cups of coffee were thrown in.  Toss in a tip for poor service and we were close to $100 for a limp salad and 4 plates of half eaten mediocre food.  I gave this two stars and not one because at least they are trying to have vegan offerings."}
{"text":"Blue door cafe is about as good as it gets.  There is nothing better for breakfast.  Coffee is very good, and they have creative non alcoholic fruit base drinks that change every so often, pastries are next level. A great morning is breakfast at the BDC then the overlook trail which is close by, about 1 mile with an excellent view of the river."}
{"text":"The most top notch restaurant in the area. Quality of the ingredients is of up most importance here. The food is presented with a European feel (which makes sense considering the owner is from Germany), which is refreshing and welcome. While it's true that this is not the cheapest place around, you are most certainly getting what you're paying for here. That being said, I don't find it exorbitant either. Do yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"The Blue Door is consistently excellent. The daily menu is more than adequate for an excellent breakfast or lunch but the daily specials are always phenomenal.   Michael incorporates high quality farm to table ingredients that really add to the taste of the food. Try the bacon.  The prices may seem high but this is top end food not processed junk. The service is friendly and efficient. Be prepared for a wait Sunday after 9. They also serve dinner now which is equally excellent but only on weekend nights.  They are closed Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"The Blue Door brought a smile to our face to an otherwise sad visit to the Akron area (there for a funeral). We are glad we took the suggestion of a local to come to the Blue Door for breakfast. My husband had the corned beef hash and I had the huge banana pancake... Both were exceptionally good! The croissant that came with my husbands corned beef hash was awesome. We got regular coffee and we're happy with the quality of that as well.  It is a little pricey but for local/non-gmo food completely worth it!  Next time we are in the area we are sure to return!"}
{"text":"My favorite local place... You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Try the corned beef hash or any of the daily specials (french toast, crepes, etc.) It's so refreshing to find a place who cares so much about quality and using local ingredients.  It can be pricy, but you won't be disappointed! And make sure you get a lemon bar or something from their bakery case before you leave!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best brunch food ever. In CFalls? Can it be? Better than anything I ever had in Chicago, where people are obsessed with BRUNCH. (I mean it. I've seen people wait two hours for their mimosas and gluten-free pancakes and salmon dill omelets or whatever.) But the Blue Door is fantastic--the eggs are constantly perfect, the fruit is fresh AND the kind you want. Anywhere else, you order \"fresh seasonal fruit\" and wind up with one lone wilted grape on top of a slab of watery melon or honeydew in some syrupy sauce. NOT HERE. Pineapple, blueberries, strawberries, even surprisingly ripe blackberries. I die.  AND THE BACON. If you're not a vegetarian (obviously), you must try it. Or at least smell it. Some meat aficionado would probably be able to tell you the source of this bacon's intoxicating olfactory powers. It smells like WOOD. I swear. Is it Applewood smoked? I have no idea. I am no great meat lover, but this bacon is insanely perfect.  I usually order the vegetarian croissant monsieur, which has the perfect amount of horseradish to make my little Hungarian heart rejoice. Mmmm.   The place can get busy, so expect to wait a bit on a Saturday. They recently removed their booths for more seating, which turned out somewhat awkward and less intimate; you may be knocking knees with your neighbors. But nothing is enough to dissuade me from returning and giving them patronage. Fabulous. Never change, Blue Door!"}
{"text":"Food was pricey, but WORTH IT. I would've had a better experience had the house coffee been listed on the menu. I was under the impression that it was going to cost me $7 for ANY of their caffeine. I'm giving this place a better rating in hopes that they list their house coffee on the menu. It was misleading..."}
{"text":"Best tasting food within 30 miles.  Period.  Great for breakfast, lunch, and now dinner.  Make it a point to go for dinner.  Service is great and Michael, the owner, is passionate about food and his patrons.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would."}
{"text":"The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery changes up their menu and there's always something on there that's delicious and scrumptious. I haven't tried much in their dessert or bakery department but their food has always been satisfying and full of flavor. Their coffee is also good. Can't wait to go back to try more. The only thing that has bothered me is the one time I asked for my dish to be without egg and the waitress said, \"well that's weird\". I don't really care about anyone else's opinion on what i'm eating. I think she realized what she said was inappropriate and made up for it by finishing up with friendly service and a to-go cup of coffee."}
{"text":"While the breakfast food is indeed very good, be prepared to pay for it. My wallet is always hurting when I leave - seems too expensive for breakfast."}
{"text":"Shout out to the Door once again. We LOVE this place. The specials are so creative and the flavors Are incredible. The care the  Blue Door takes in the origin of the food down to the cooking of each meal is well worth the cost. We are so fortunate to have the Blue Door.  Try the steak and eggs. It's AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last weekend, and enjoyed one of the best brunches I've had since moving to Cleveland.   The croissant I had with my breakfast sandwich was honestly the most beautiful, flaky on the outside moist on the inside thing ever.  biting into it, feeling the initial crunch of the crust, then the buttery, warm inside. Oh my God.   There was a lot of attention to detail with the food - for example the fruit was free of filler melons (that's the worst). And instead was comprised of blackberries, pineapple, and strawberries. The whole meal was delicious.   Why not 5 stars?  At this point everyone should know that NE Ohio is very cold half of the year.  Not a big deal, but I was seated right next to the door, which isn't well protected from the elements like most restaurants here.  I had to wear a coat because it was freezing, and a little bit of snow reached my table.  Not a big deal, but a tiny buzz kill."}
{"text":"It's rare that I go to a restaurant and think about the meal the whole day. After eating brunch at the Blue Door Cafe that's exactly how I felt. Went on a Sunday at 11 AM. It was crowded, but a little tip, you can eat at the counter. There are 5 seats available. By taking a seat at the counter you're bypassing waiting in line.  They have 2 menus, a list of specials and the brunch menu. Their menu isn't that big but I feel that by having a smaller menu you can perfect the food, and that they did.  Myself and another person got the blueberry pancakes. They use local yogurt in the batter. I wasn't sure what sort of taste it would have but the pancakes didn't taste any different, they were just very fluffy and by far the best pancakes I've ever had. The other people in my group had crepes that had chocolate mousse in them. She enjoyed them a lot. Another person had the eggs and bacon that came with their homemade bread. He said the eggs were nothing special, eggs are eggs. But of course he thought the homemade bread was good and the bacon was delicious.  The eggs and bacon were off their standard menu, the blueberry pancakes and crepes were on their list of specials. I know the specials also included quiche but they were all out of it when we got there.  I saw people comment on the service being questionable at times. I don't know if we didn't have that problem because we sat at the counter but we found our waitress to be friendly and prompt. She said the bacon they serve has been served at the White House for the past 30 years. The bacon is a bit expensive, $4 for 2 pieces but it's definitely worth it.  They also have a bakery with fresh pastries, everything looked delicious.  This place was amazing, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic. Although the restaurant was not full we were seated tightly between two other parties, one which was quite loud. The service was a little slow(apparently short staffed) and the wine pours from the pairing could have been a little more generous. The wine temperatures were also a little warm. The food was amazing and the flavors were so lovely on the palate. We definitely will be back but will insist on a more roomy seating."}
{"text":"Their French toast and coffee are AMAZING!!!!! Great from scratch corn beef has and jam. Love this place"}
{"text":"Have eaten here five times now. I cook professionally and have been dying to find a place as dedicated and passionate towards food as i am. This place is hands down the best restaurant ive found in the area, and having traveled and staged abroad, they are on par easily with eateries in larger cities. Kudos to the baking program as well as the gents and ladies slingin pans on the line for a la carte service. Highly recommended to all of my friends, associates and family. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Mothers Day, could you pick a busier day. NO! They did an awesome job! We ordered the special \"Lobster Benedict\". Unfortunately we were informed they were out of it. So we chose another special the Bacon and Avocado Quiche. Very yummy. While we were waiting the (I believe he was) owner, came over with a small dish of desserts to apologize for not have the Benedict. What a wonderful touch. The service (Kyle) was fun and very attentive. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the Blue Door/Golden Goose. I went to breakfast with a friend on a weekend during the late morning. There was a line, and we waited for about 20-25 minutes or so. The owner came over part way through to give us an update. He was very friendly, and we appreciated knowing how far up the list we had moved. There is very little room for waiting. Plus, because this place is a bakery, you have a lot of foot traffic in and out, among the people who are waiting for seats. On top of that, this is one of those places that you pay the cashier on the way out after you finish your meal. Lots of people in a small space. In the end, this didn't hurt the experience.   Our server was exceptionally nice. You could tell he really wanted to do a good job. Very professional but friendly. I got pancakes and eggs and hot tea. The food was very good. The tea is from Angel Falls, which is totally awesome. It's loose-leaf tea, served like they do at AF - -and you get to drink it with pancakes!   One small problem is that the booths are particularly uncomfortable.   I look forward to visiting BD/GG again soon, perhaps on a weekday or earlier on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"(Please note that this is now the Blue Door Cafe & Bakery. Also, as of this writing their hours are 7am to 3pm, Wednesday through Sunday.)  After two visits to the Blue Door, I can confidently say that they serve some of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I'm sort of an aficionado of breakfasts, and have eaten my way around Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco in search of something really exceptional.  The Blue Door is it.   On our first visit, I ordered a daily special: Glenfiddich French toast with grilled peaches, and a side of bacon. This time, I went for the house-made corned beef hash with eggs over hard, a mini croissant, and another side of bacon.   The French toast was exceptional, made from the bakery's dense challah bread and delicately flavored with the peach and whiskey. Personally I could have used a tiny bit more bite from the whiskey, but that was the only complaint from that entire meal.   The hash? Out of this world. The house-brined corned beef tasted pure and fresh, the bacon added a lovely smoky note, and the potatoes and peppers were present without being overpowering. The eggs were perhaps a shade on the underdone side, but a slightly oozing yolk is actually what I hope for when ordering over hard, so I have no complaints there.  For my bread, I selected a mini croissant, since on our last visit my wife had raved about the croissant that surrounded her excellent caprese sandwich. (She also raved about her Croissant Monsieur on this visit.) And rightly so: flaky, buttery, crispy without being the slightest bit hard -- this croissant kicks the face's ass of any croissant I've had previously. My only regret is that I devoured it before trying the house-made strawberry jam. Holy cats, this jam is the business. They flavor fresh strawberry preserves with allspice and cinnamon, and they could run a very successful side business selling this stuff out of jars. (When I asked if they sold it in jars, our helpful waitress said they didn't, but them promptly handed over three of the single-serving containers for us to take home. It will not last long.)  I'm saving the best for last: the Blue Door's bacon. These slabs of pork essence come thick -- I mean, really thick, probably the thickness of three slices of generously sliced bacon anywhere else. They walk the line between bacon and pork belly, with a wonderful smoky flavor that's somehow like eating a memory of your favorite childhood campfire. (I mean that in the best possible way.) My only reservation regarding this heavenly meat is that it was cooked differently for our two visits. The first time it was cooked through but not crisp, much closer to the pork-belly side of the spectrum. This time it was crispier, but also somewhat tougher, closer to a pancetta. I preferred the previous preparation, but my wife strongly preferred the crispier version. So: a matter of taste.  But please, if you're in the area, do go and taste. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast spot.  Found this on yelp when on a business trip.  Try to stop here every time I am in town."}
{"text":"A wayward wanderer... hungry and alone, I arrive at the Blue Door and am suddenly transported to the French countryside.... where tender slices of venison and wild forest mushrooms always accompany a breakfast of two perfectly prepared eggs with creamy polenta. Ahhhh... if only every meal was this delightful."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast I've had in a long time! My husband ordered the corned beef hash and I had the quiche - a delightful combination of ham, spinach, artichoke, and Gruyere. My husband said the corned beef hash was top notch and my quiche was simply dreamy. Excellent cup of coffee to compliment the morning, courteous staff, casual atmosphere.  The croissants are flaky perfection - we purchased two to take home with the house made jam. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with atmosphere to match.  Be prepared its busy over breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Food was great I'd say the best breakfast in Akron! well portioned. Not enough to bring home, and not good for a hangover cure. For a light breakfast you will be satisfied. Our server was knowledgeable, coffee was always refilled.   Negatives:    A little pricey, the quality of food is there but still feels like your getting gouged. Biggest pet peeve of the day Shared tables!!!! Your literally bumping elbows no matter what in the booths, it's insane. for the price tags on the menu I would say that it doesn't fit. I felt uncomfortable the entire time constantly apologizing to complete and utter strangers on both sides of me. Lastly the check!! The restaurant is typically busy and so smushed together it's hard to get anyone attention, we waited at least 20 minutes for the check and even longer to make sure he actually picked it up. No fun and ruined the ease of service for me :/   Though I'd  say it's definitely a must try! Next time we may wait for anything except a booth haha"}
{"text":"I've been her over 200 times in the past four years. They have gone through multiple chefs, a few ups and downs, but now it is as solid as ever. Great service, amazing food--what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pastries I have ever had. The danish, breakfast bun, and croissant were all divine! We had brunch, also: Jamison french toast made with challah. It was insane how good this was. It's a laid back place, but the people who work there are great. If my family ever visits and I want to take them to brunch, this is where I will go."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced, but the food is delicious. Worth the splurge if you ask me. More of a treat than a neighborhood hangout. Don't get the lox plate unless you're not that hungry. The baked goods are wonderful too! Usually I just hit up the bakery rather than dining in. The service is nice but the servers can be very short."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with this hidden secret of Ohio.  Saw this place had great reviews and good vegetarian options so I decided to stop in. On a Friday at 11:30 a.m. this place was nearly packed! As I walked by the drive-thru windows, I could even start to smell the aroma of fresh bread. I knew I was in for a treat.  Sadly, I had to order my dish to go, hence no picture. But boy was it a work of genius. I ordered the Garlic Roasted Naan, which was folded into a large taco with swiss, arugula, and zucchini. The best part was it was served with a side of I believe tomato bisque (?) with a wonderful blend of indian spices (dare I say garam masala...?)  I always associate naan with my many instances exploring of indian cuisine, so the fluffy warm naan, the delicate flavors of the zucchini, arugula, and swiss with a hint of the garlic from the naan went PERFECTLY with the soup which just had a hint of indian spice to make you smile and appreciate the well rounded-ness and planning that went into this single dish. I'm still blown away the day after.  I would highly recommend this place not only for the food and smells but the service too. Very friendly and accommodating to my need to order to-go after sitting at a table.   Wonderful job Blue Door! Never change."}
{"text":"The wife and I took our 18 month old to The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was before 11am and decently busy, but we were sat after a short wait.   My wife got the Tartine and I opted for the Vegetarian Croissant Monsieur. We ordered an english muffin and fruit for the little one.  Our meals were delicious and the portions were perfect in size. Definitely a place in which we'd like to visit again and try the other options that seemed equally appealing.   However, the frustrating part was actually having to wait almost as long as it took to eat our meal to pay for it. They are set up for payment when you walk out, which wouldn't be that big of a deal except there was only one register. This register handled all the table bills as well as to go customers.   This is definitely something that needs to be addressed, as I can only imagine it's worse during busier times."}
{"text":"I finally went here after waiting more than a year (just didn't have the time to make it out there to CFalls), and it was delicious. I went with my parents and we had a reservation, so we got right in (hint: make a reservation if you want to go on the weekends). It was pretty crowded, and we sat at a high top table that was so close to the table next to us, we felt like we were sharing a meal with them. Our waiter was extremely attentive and on top of things, despite how crowded it was. I ordered one of the seasonal items - the laughing bird shrimp omelette, which was delicious, with a side of potatoes that I split with my mom. At the end of the meal,w we ordered some pastries to go because they just looked too good sitting there on the bakery shelf. The bill was kind of expensive though - 3 people and it was $71. (My parents also got hot tea,  and I got a mimosa.) That was my only complaint. I realize we got great quality meals, but it was a little bit of a sticker shock. It wouldn't stop me from coming back though - I would love to explore some more of the menu for brunch another day."}
{"text":"Food is five stars, but the prices are a bit more than I expected. Still great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Sooooooo yummy. Couldn't decide so tried a few items. The service was fast and friendly. It is low key so not a lot in the decor, but the marble and wood tables holding light colored placemats and clear vases with a single white flower at each table makes it sweet and beautiful. They serve you on all white plain dishes, including the coffee cups, baby cream holder, and the coffee pot. Water is served in delicate glass goblets. Makes you feel like your somewhere like Sweden instead of Ohio. We had candied bacon and it is really thick and good (my hubby's fav item actually). Crepes are what brought   us here and there's a few to choose from . Apricot was kind of too strong for me so I only ate half of one, but my hubby gobbled his down! The plain with butter and Ohio maple syrup is very simple, but simply yummy! My fav though...(drumroll please).....the sweet cheese crepe. It is cream cheese mixed with sugar and vanilla and also strawberry sauce. It calls for the demand of a return  visit for me!!!! Yummy. Yummy. Yummy."}
{"text":"I spent the last few days looking forward to revisiting this place, as I had a wonderful meal here 5 -6 years ago.  The upgrades made to this restaurant since my last visit have not been good and I cannot imagine a reason for me to ever come back.    The proprietor has placed his desire for maximum profit well above that of the customer's.  It's a small place.  You can shoehorn seating for 100 in a space suited for 60, it doesn't mean any single person inside will enjoy it.  The owner has successfully created a restaurant without a single comfortable table in the entire joint.  You have a choice of eating in the parking lot or chose to eat inside.  Inside your choice is eating with your face 6 inches from the butt of the counter clientele, or the obnoxious host who violated my eating space repeatedly, and/or essentially dining with the people at the table next to yours. When your neighbor attempt to gracefully pry themselves out of their seating - their butts and/or nether regions have no place to go but in your food.  The bathrooms are also inches from the dining room.  There's a lot of butt going on in here and it's not a good thing.  I get it that meals prepared with local and healthy ingredients of high quality will cost more, but I don't get why that would require the end product to be pretentious food at obscene prices.  Two of us had above average coffee and two very small mediocre breakfast meals served adequately in the most uncomfortable seating imaginable for a better part of a staggering $40. My multi-ingredient omelet with two additional different toppings and 10 potato cubes made possibly with the best of ingredients was completely and utterly tasteless.  I was left wanting more, feeling cheated and desperate to get out of there."}
{"text":"OK! Where do I begin? My wife and I (occasionally the kids if they get out of bed) visit Blue Door nearly every weekend. The crew is amazing, and once you meet the owner, you see why. He clearly leads by example, ensuring each and every guest is comfortable and welcome. Next, look at the baked goods, they are artwork. Better than art. From the Morning Glory muffins, ham & cheese croissants, brownies, you name it, simply amazing. My wife varies her selection each visit, but I stick with what I love, Corn Beef Hash (scrambled eggs) with their English Muffin (they make them). All the ingredients are locally sourced, fresh, and delectable. Coffee is piping hot, and they never let the cup get empty. There are very few places I recommend without hesitation, but this place is one of them. Keep up the great work Michael and team!"}
{"text":"I want to go back tomorrow morning and every day after! My mouth is salivating just thinking about the food here!   I ordered the Croque Monsieur in which they enfold all the ingredients into one of their freshly baked croissants. Another person in my party ordered the Pumpkin French Toast (WOW!) it was not too sweet and as I took a bite said out loud, \"This tastes like Thanksgiving!\" The other person in my party ordered the corned beef hash. I do not like corned beef but he enjoyed every bit of it- I will trust his opinion.   They bake all their pastries in house!  This is a MUST TRY breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden brunch restaurant and baker! It's on a corner and the only sign I saw said \"bakery\" so it is a little hard to find.  I came on a Saturday around 11 and we did have to wait about 15 minutes, which is no big deal. During our wait in between the doors, a women came out and asked us if we wanted to try a cinnamon stick. I thought was so nice!  I love that this restaurant uses local and organic food and coffee. The coffee was hot and had great flavor. On the menu it says what city some items are from. I got the croissant monsieur with fresh fruit and it was delicious and large. The homemade croissant was flaky and fresh! I added an egg to mine, which I highly recommend.  We had a great server. He checked back with us often and delivered our food and drinks in a timely manner.  I would definitely come back here next time I am in town and will recommend it to friends near by."}
{"text":"I love the Blue Doors \"roots\" as I would call them. Before they got extremely popular. When they had the ugly tables with the 1980 -something business card Formica on top--- I think those days were much better. The owner is a gem. However I don't think he's quite grasped the customer service end of his business.   Almost every time I've ever been in there service has been lacking. Yes!!! The food is exceptional. But without the service behind it, it's just another snobby, establishment where ppl are just grazing.  You cannot even get a refill half the time with your meal. I almost feel this is done on purpose so they can turn tables over quicker????? Cuyahoga Falls ISNT Beechwood. Or Tremont.... Or LA. It just isn't. We are a small, family oriented community who has been blessed by the passion and gift of this wonderful chef who I think is having an identity crisis.  If I were able to come in and run the place for a few months--- front of house that is--- I bet it would flourish even more so than it is. You should know everyone by name by now to greet them and genuinely thank them for their business. Make ppl feel welcomed and appreciated.  The servers think so highly of themselves it's comical. Come on dudes-- it's just a small time place in a small time town. Get over it.   Anyhow-- today the croissants were exceptional. They were tender and buttery and not over baked like they have been before. It almost tasted to me like at one point they changed the butter.  I will always love the blue door, I just don't frequent it as much as i used to because it pains me how pretentious it has grown into. Michael is a genius. And a good man. Take care of ALL of your customers. Just not the Prada wearing ones....."}
{"text":"Enter the Blue Door for a culinary treat. Please follow them on FB for menu updates as well as background information on their philosophy and seemingly controversial choices. It helped me to read about the dynamics behind the counter. Explains a lot and made me appreciate what they are doing. Everything ingredient is chosen with quality in mind. I love that they have relationships with their vendors and get excited for the latest \"find\". Everything I have had here has been good. Please allow extra time no matter what time of day it is. Service has been hit or miss every other visit for us and there does not seem to be any rhyme or reason. I'm sure they're aware so I've never complained and honestly if I'm that impatient I will go to the counter to ask for what I need. And never skip dessert."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the area. Parking can be a little tricky (drive around back). Be patient if their is a wait...it will be worth it.   At its heart, this place is a bakery. All breads and pastries are made in house and are amazing. Even if you order something as simple as a low carb bacon and egg dish you will be pleased...as the eggs are organic and bacon is carefully selected from choice producers.  This place is good to the core."}
{"text":"Waited 40 mins to be seated and then waited another 30 mins to get our food. The food is amazing. I had the salmon and eggs. Our waitress is very nice. I had a great time there."}
{"text":"First off the food is amazing.  Coming from Los Angeles, we are brunch snobs and hands down, this was one of the best breakfast's we've ever had.  Between 10 of us, we pretty much ordered everything, but my favorites were the Chocolate/Hazelnut Crepe, Bacon & Egg Croissant and the Bacon/Avocado Quiche.  Big props to the manager.  He was able to get our large party seated in a timely fashion!  Very impressed with the staff and the service and can't say enough nice things."}
{"text":"So if your hungry, go there. My wife and I drove 20 minutes to come here from brunch.  Worth the drive? Yes!"}
{"text":"First timer.... the good was amazing and the service A+.  Definitely will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"The mark of a good restaurant for me is quality over time.  That is to say, whether it's the first time or hundred and first time, I still walk out saying \"Wow!\"  The Blue Door Caf√© is a little gem located in Cuyahoga Falls, and for the longest time I hadn't the slightest that it even existed seeing as the fa√ßade of the building does not sport any discernible sign.  However, you may be able to see the quaint blue door from the road, though it may be blocked by the packed parking lot.   Walking in you may notice you will have to wait to be seated, but so far this has never been an issue.  They are really able to cycle out tables quickly.  You must also take note of the two menus you are handed.  One will be their everyday menu, while the other is a daily special menu.  What's awesome about the special menu is that it always changes.  I've been to the Blue Door multiple times and each time the menus have been different, and trust me that's not a bad thing.  The coffee served is also from a local caf√© in Akron, Angel Falls Caf√©, and it's spectacular.  Some of my friends even claim they brew it better than Angel Falls.   My girlfriend and I arrived this morning around 8:30.  There was a short wait of about 5-10 minutes.  The staff I must add is very friendly and unlike many restaurants, when they say it will be about 5-10 minutes it doesn't turn into 25 minutes.  Their demeanor is also very professional, they know the menu in and out and are more than happy to serve (they are always smiling!).     The greatest thing about the Blue Door is deciding what to order.  The menus are filled with locally grown, wild caught and freshly made entrees.  Rest assured, regardless of what you order you will be satisfied.  Today my girlfriend was torn between the grilled cheese and the rum soaked French toast.  She eventually decided on the French toast with a side of over easy eggs (cage free eggs from a farm in Wadsworth).  It was by far the best French toast she has ever had.  Incredibly rich, each and every bite explodes with flavor.  For me, I decided on the seafood breakfast ravioli.  The ravioli are freshly made and are stuffed with a mixture of fresh halibut and sea scallop.  Included on the plate is a perfectly poached egg, fresh asparagus and a crispy pancetta.  This was accompanied with a cream sauce and a puree (can't remember the ingredients here sorry!).  The ravioli were top notch!  These are the best ravioli I have had since my time in Italy; it's just kind of funny that I had them in a brunch spot.    Listen, treat yourself and someone else and go to this place!  You will not be disappointed.  I've gone here five times now, and without a doubt I'll be going back again.  I highly recommend the Blue Door Caf√©."}
{"text":"This is a great \"date place\" based on the food and the well-dressed couples around us (my husband and I). I also saw clusters of friends and family, which tells me this isn't just a \"nice\" place with fancy food to take someone you're trying to impress, but the comfort food will delight that hard-to-please relative. I've posted pics of the menu, but I'm told it's subject to change week by week. Hubby chatted with the manager (please see George S's review) and asked him many food-related questions which were patiently answered. Two important pieces of information - first,  Blue Door has no freezer! Everything they have is fresh as can be. Second, if you happen to be there within a half-hour of closing, their amazing pastries are discounted! And that's why I walked away with two chocolate eclairs large enough to use as baseball bats. Yummy, delicious baseball bats...."}
{"text":"I've been to the Blue Door twice for breakfast.  The first time I got the corned beef hash and it was very good but it's  $12.  The second time I decided to try a special - cajun eggs benedict with crab and collard greens at $16. It was not very good. The collard greens were sour and the hollandaise  had an odd flavor - not a good combination at all. The English muffins are really big, but nothing special. I sat at a tall table and my feet dangled several inches above the foot rest. The service was fine though."}
{"text":"We've been to the Blue Door multiple times and always loved it.  I think their coffee is great and the food, though slightly overpriced, has always been pretty good. Sitting inside seems very crowded and tight, so we have always gone during summer months and opted for the patio.   Just went for the first time this summer, waited about 30 minutes for a patio table, and when we were finally seated we realized the menu has changed.  Apparently now there is a \"weekday\" menu and a weekend \"Brunch\" menu.  I loved their crepes and my husband loved their corned beef hash, but since we went on Saturday it was the brunch menu and neither of those were on the menu (and looking at their website they no longer seem to have crepes at all =(...)  We took a brief glance at the menu ($15 for bacon and eggs!!!!!), saw they had changed it and raised prices and left.  Probably won't be back, which is a bummer."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food servers are friendly and attentive.   We heard a lot about how amazing the food is here and the atmosphere and decided to try. We sat outside and it's our first time there, so I ordered Croissant Monsieur and my friend ordered Bacon and eggs with Potato Croquette on the side. I have to say that both meals' presentation are perfect.  The Croissant Monsieur are very tasty, and the potato croquette is crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. Absolutely love it.   I would totally come here again!!"}
{"text":"The Lucky's Cafe of the Akron area, but better in many respects. No decor, service is friendly but a little rushed. Seating can be a little tight depending on whether in a booth or a table. The beverage selection is freaking horrible- Virgil's is gross IMO. How does this get five stars? The food makes up for all of it!  Here is the deal. The regular menu has several winners. Any sandwich made with their house made croissants is great, especially the croque monsieur. The corned beef hash is especially good because it is made with the Nueske bacon (this is some ridiculously flavorful bacon). Their housemade English muffins and jam is delicious. The desserts are as good as you will find in the area (not better than but equal to West Point Market and West Side Bakery). The regular menu is pretty great but...  The thing that makes this place really special though are the insane specials they do on the weekends. Really unusual time consuming painstaking dishes that only a really passionate food lover would bother with. The sauerbraten beef dish over dumplings with apple sauce was insane. I mean as good as anything I have ever had. If you go on a weekend eat one of the specials. Trust me."}
{"text":"The food is good.  Don't get me wrong, it's good.  But it's such an oddly fussy menu for an interior that looks like no one cares about it.  Not much art on the boring, beige walls.  Super crowded and inelegant tables.  Stains on the ceiling.  The blue door itself needs a paint job.  At the end of the day, I don't really need a fancy menu with unnecessarily complicated items.  However, if I'm going to that sort of place, then I want an interior that matches the menu.  Give me a calm, elegant, and pretty interior to go with my fancy and pricey food."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing breakfast. So many unique options. Have been here a ton. If you like chocolate milk, you have to get it. It is amazing. Food is so flavorful."}
{"text":"The food is great but a bit over priced. I think it should marked $$$"}
{"text":"Recently went for breakfast after this place reopened as the Blue Door. Owner greeted us in our gym clothes and couldn't have been nicer in introducing us to the place, the food and the concept.  The food was excellent. I ordered of the Bourbon Street specials menu. I chose the creole hash. Great portion, excellent corned beef and shrimp. Sausage was pretty tasty too. That corned beef, though-hoh boy. So tender. So corned. So beef.   The homemade english muffins were pretty tasty. And they sell them up front. What a shame I have to move out of the Falls soon. I'll have to come back. Wish we had more restaurants like this one."}
{"text":"I am in bacon heaven - Nueske's bacon was served crisp and succulent with a smokey finish. I melted into the Mango Waffle - a ridiculously light and fluffy waffle with bits of fresh mango on top, a mango mousse, coconut & maple sauce with a raspberry crumble. It was reminiscent of my trip to Maui - I could almost hear the gentle lapping of the waves. But I digress: they also had excellent strong, dark French press coffee, which is hard to find in Ohio. Last but not least was the fun, saucy service and easy going ambience."}
{"text":"first time eating brunch here and overall food was good.!!  I had the corned beef hash which was okay..the prices a bit much and place was very hard too find (party of 8 cost $200 for brunch?!$)..just look for the blue door..also great service but atmosphere okay.. with food prices so high the owner can def afford to repair ceiling in dinning room and a store front sign. we might be back"}
{"text":"New friends of ours recommended this place.  Um, YUM!  Small menu but the offerings are stellar and the focus is on locally sourced ingredients and house-made items.  Don't miss the Oktoberfest sandwich (local brat, sauerkraut, sweet mustard on a house-made roll) or the Reuben.  And hellllllooooo Nueske bacon.  Best smoked bacon ever.  I got a few pastry items on the way out (lemon bar, brownie, cannoli) and I am disappointed to say they looked better than they tasted.  Major disappointment in those  choices."}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets in the Akron/Cuyahoga Falls/Hudson area. Love everything there, including the food, the service and especially the bakery.  Dinner is great, but we mostly hit this spot for breakfast.  Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Parking was not plentiful..and be careful not to walk through the drive thru on your way into the restaurant.   The service from moment of entry was great. Friendly and prompt.   Food quality is very good...well seasoned and executed. Large portions...a bit pricey but that is to be expected with the quality."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for brunch and well worth the wait. The reason it's busy is it's just so good!   The food is fantastic and you can taste the care and effort made in preparing it.  I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Oh. My. Goodness. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. So cute and cozy. Very clean. I even loved the white dishes. The food was phenomenal. I had the quiche Lorraine and my husband--the shrimp and grits. Sooooo good.  We are already looking forward to our next trip!  Fresh, organic and very inviting."}
{"text":"Pricey for Cuyahoga Falls, but delicious for Cuyahoga Falls. Excellent Service. Pastries are French style and spot on, fresh baked. I love the fact that they don't have a sign, which seems to irritate the residents here far more than it should."}
{"text":"Recently stopped by for a relaxing breakfast as we had heard so much about this restaurant. We were very disappointed. The toast was so tough I barely could bite it. The two pieces of bacon were not cooked evenly, greasy, I couldn't finish it. The eggs were ok, but wish there were an option to order less than three. It seems a waste. I ordered two and received the three eggs and bacon special.   I did mention the toast to the waiter and he admitted that the bread wasn't as fresh, as it was a few days old. The bacon had been reheated. We both had the three eggs, two pieces of bacon, toast and coffee and the bill came to $34.00. Quite a steep sum for a breakfast that caused nausea and was mostly inedible. The coffee was average.   The waiter was polite and honest about the food and the preparation. We will never return."}
{"text":"The food here is made really well with a lot of attention to detail. I would say its more of a gourmet brunch place, with changing menus and all. Although food takes a while to get done, the quality is fantastic. No issues with service either."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing. I found this place after reading other yelp reviews on local restaurants. The quality of food here is second to none. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast with fresh fruit and homemade meals. It is a very healthy atmosphere. This isn't a bob Evans processed breakfast. And the best part is that the menu changes every week!!! This place really gives you an incentive to come back and try new things every week. I will have to try dinner here next since the breakfast here is stellar!"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in the Akron area. Make sure you call and make a reservation. (That's something new they are doing.) Food is exceptional. Splurge and get the French Press coffee."}
{"text":"This morning we tried the Boeuf Bourguignon and I think it was one of the best things that I've eaten at the Blue Door although all of your food is absolutely wonderful. I have tried to make it on my own several times and although it was pretty good this experience was exquisite. I had no problem consuming this hearty dish despite the warm weather. We are so fortunate to have a restaurant in the area that is synonymous with excellence and quality!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I find a rare jewel of a restaurant here on Yelp, and I must say Blue Door was a \"sapphire\" of a find.   Staff = Super Nice. Like, I don't use words carelessly. Genuine, friendly hospitality. It's rare and it was SO appreciated.  Ambiance= Casual but classy. Very comfortable. Somehow busy, but not at all loud.   Food= Delicious of course. I ordered the crepe appetizer, which consisted of two of the most fluffiest crepes I've ever eaten and 6 mini-ramekins full of yummy things to smear on them. Fun yummy stuff like lemon curd and lingonberry.   Big Girl Drinks= Yes. Because we came for brunch, I got a mimosa. Fresh squeezed o.j. Aw, yeah.   The rest of the menu seemed full of other interesting items (not just your plain ole breakfast and lunch fare) of which I will be trying when I return, which will hopefully be many times.   My only regret is it's too far from where I live. Walking distance would be ideal."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a Saturday morning at the Blue Door.  For a first time visit, we were very impressed and happy to have this type of dining option in the Falls.  Though not a cheap dining option, everything we had was very good.  We both opted for items off the special menu including the French toast of the day and the clam bake breakfast.  I have to confess that I scrunched my face when I read a clam bake breakfast (and was called out on it by the server).  I was assured that it was a hit.....and it was!  There was nothing cookie cutter about this place.  Arrived around 815a to find the place about 1/3 full.  By 915, they were on a wait.  We look forward to making this part of the weekend morning routine. Now to just figure out a way to leave without getting sucked into buying some of the amazing freshly-baked pastries!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a great place for breakfast or brunch.  All natural ingredients, nothing artificial, not even Splenda.  Also they had very good French Press Coffee.  I am a big fan!."}
{"text":"NOT your average breakfast!  It is awesome--they make bacon and eggs that are out of this world as it is very flavorful.  Other options are the house made granola with locally sourced milk and yogurt.  The one time we were able to order the quiche, before it disappeared, it was really good.  Recently tried the apple cider and of course, it was awesome!  Wes and the gang do a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"A friend who lives near The Blue Door brought my spouse and me there for breakfast. Lucky us! The Blue Door is an amazing bakery. Our group sampled the homemade English muffin and the croissant. Both were delicious and perfect in every way.  As a coffee lover, I appreciated the selection of French pressed and drip coffee. The three of us opted for a press pot of Sumatra coffee. Very tasty as well. If you only visited The Blue Door for coffee and a pastry, you'd leave delighted. But, there's more!  The breakfast entrees feature high quality ingredients from organic veggies to pasture-raised meats. We tried the Eggs and Bacon, Corned Beef Hash, and Steak and Eggs. The portions were generous and each plate was seasoned nicely. My only complaint is that the kitchen will not poach eggs. Over easy was a solid substitute. Given the choice between a poorly poached or a perfectly over easy egg, I'll take the perfectly cooked one any day. I appreciate a kitchen that plays to its strengths and isn't afraid to decline a customer request.   The ambiance is homey and the service is excellent--so warm and friendly. We visited on a chilly morning and when we walked in, it felt like stepping into my grandma's kitchen. Fragrant from the fresh baked goodies and so cozy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday.  The place was modern rustic with a touch of homeliness.  The menu was simple and specials were plenty.  All the food was fresh and pretty much on point.  The food is good fusion of America and Europe; clean and hearty with complex and delicate flavor.  The service was pretty attentive except for when trying to get the check to pay and leave.  The baked goods were huge and tasty; the breads smelled magnificent.  This place seems really popular looking at the reviews and trying to find an open spot in the parking lot, which unfortunately means that you might have to wait much longer if you have a group more than you and a \"special friend\".   If you don't want to wait, I would suggest to just sit on a possible open stool at the \"bar\"."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about this business about nine months to a year ago.  Back then I gave my honest review that I felt the food was fantastic but the service lacking.  I'd like to take the time to \"update\" my past comment because it can often seem that people only come on yelp to degrade businesses sometimes.    Due to a more streamlined menu of consistent food offerings paired with weekly themed menus; along with a competent and caring staff who know the amazing food their chef prepares, this establishment has come the rest of the way to being a world class establishment.  I've never had a dish there I didn't like...and I've been there three weekends in a row and counting!  The flavors are phenomenal and the dishes are just the right size to feel like you've enjoyed a meal without being overly stuffed.  All the staff is friendly and attentive.  And the pricing never breaks the bank.  We couldn't be luckier to have such exceptional quality outside of a huge city.    Thank you to the owner for taking the time to make the improvements needed to make this such an exceptional establishment that I am proud to have in my backyard!  Kudos and keep up the outstanding work!!!"}
{"text":"So many great flavors to choose from.  The coffee is amazing. If you are not in for trying something new, just go with the bacon and eggs. It's hard to believe that they can take something so simple and make it stand out above all other places."}
{"text":"I have been going to Blue Door Cafe for brunch for years now and it never ceases to make my day. The food on the menu changes periodically and whenever they bring in something new I know it is going to be so yummy. Everything is fresh, locally grown, and creative. My favorite options are the Croque Madame and the Ricotta Crepes. The waiters are so kind even on busy Saturday's and Sunday's. When my friends think of a brunch option, Blue Door is always at the top of the list, and will probably stay that way!"}
{"text":"I had to update this one. LeBron James was mealing here today. Swell guy. He and his wife were being swell to everyone around them. Also, a very tall bloke.  My buddy gave him daps and LB promised him a championship victory. Good news!  That said, this establishment is good enough for the King (and his men) so it's good enough for all (in). Also, the grilled cheese tastes fine. I didn't have the tomato soup, but it was plenty orange. My friend got the bass, which is served with plenty of lettuce. I think, he thinks, he's a bunny rabbit.  OK, great place. Yep!!"}
{"text":"First of all I normally don't like coffee, but the coffee here (Bali blue moon) was so good I happily drank it black. Everything was good, particularly the lobster ragout and poached egg biscuits. Good service, lots of parking, this place is bustling with people!  Grab some bread and a to-go cup for the last of your coffee before you leave, and come back early and often. I have been to 12 countries and this place in my wife's hometown is a gem."}
{"text":"Came here with The Wife a couple weeks ago. We've been looking forward to this place for some time, but it is a little out of the way for us.  Overall, I'd say it was pretty delicious and I like what it stands for.  Perhaps a little bit pricy for what we got, but it was a pleasant experience.  Loved the freshly squeezed orange juice and the huge and yummy croissants.  I thought the strawberry rhubarb blintzs were tasty, though light on the flavor of rhubarb, but the other dish, whose name I can't recall but had some gumbo with it was merely OK.  I wouldn't order it again.  Service was professional and polite and setting was quaint and attractive.  I'd come back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in the greater Akron area! Personally I like the dinner better than the breakfast/brunch but I still rate the breakfast/brunch a 4.9999999  The dinner is a $55 tasting menu where you get to choose from 2 starters, 2 first courses, 4ish entrees, and 2 desserts. There is usually a gf, vegan option in each category and they have gf bread which is so delicious my husband picks it over the regular bread!   The food is soooo delicious and well thought out! Unique ingredients and combinations. This is one of those places where you're never really sure what all of the ingredients are but you know it's going to be delicious!   Cons: no place to change a diaper (important to me, but not most) and the servers don't really seem to appreciate the food and they don't do the menu justice when they talk about the food (or rather just hand you the menu and ask you what you want). It would make the experience that much better if the staff was as passionate about the food as the chef was! A simple walk through of the menu while they describe the food would just be the icing on the cake! Also, be prepared for a 2 hour dinner at least!"}
{"text":"Wow, I wanted one of everything on the menu!   Husband said his Reuben was so good he will never be able to eat one anywhere else ever again.  We got here just after 8 am on Saturday morning, so it wasn't too crowded yet, we were seated right away, which I was concerned about since I'd heard it was small and often had long lines waiting for seating.   I definitely recommend getting there as early as possible to really enjoy the experience.   Wait staff a bit pretentious, that's really the only reason I knocked a star off.  The atmosphere was bright and cheery and all the baked goods looked absolutely fabulous!  Will definitely be back...kind of upset with myself for not going sooner."}
{"text":"Delicate. Simple. Delicious.  What I ate: Vegetarian Croissant sandwich - 5 stars - the flavors and textures all work perfectly together. Croissant was a treat and worth every single calorie.  Green salad side - 4 stars - fresh dark greens, light and fragrant balsamic dressing, simple.   The take away: High quality food, excellent flavor combinations. I will be a repeat offender."}
{"text":"2 years ago this place was the best place for brunch. I use to look forward coming to this place and trying their weekly menu. One day we came here and everything changed. the new chef took everything that was good about this place and replaced it with generic stuff that doesn't make any sense. I never been back and still so bitter about the change."}
{"text":"So love it here. The staff is attentive and the pastries are just to die for. My husband and I always make it a point to try one of their specials when we come for brunch. They are worth it!  Favorites are the omelette, homemade English muffins and the chocolate croissants. Their French press coffee is also superb."}
{"text":"Best breakfast hands down in Akron area. Great options, both savory and sweet. Baked goods are delicious."}
{"text":"Breakfast this morning was phenomenal. Ordered the Corned Beef Hash which might be the best I've ever had. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the homemade English Muffin was outstanding. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Such a great find!   We had 8 people that they so graciously were able to accommodate. Mimosas were spot on and the pressed coffee is WONDERFUL!   We had a variety of dishes, none of which we had any complaints about. Beef Bourguignon, Corned Beef Hash, Breakfast Sandwiches, all so delicious! The bakery items are out of this world and huge!  Everyone was very friendly here despite them being extremely busy.   If I'm ever back in the area again, I will make sure to come back!"}
{"text":"What a gem in an otherwise barron culinary desert. The lox and scrambled eggs on a homemade croissant was delicious. The server was attentive and friendly. Get there early or expect an line. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tiny little place off state road in Cuyahoga Falls. Food was great! Service was very friendly. We had about a 35 minute wait time which wasn't too bad for a Saturday morning considering the location and size. Staff is very friendly; constantly walking around replenishing  water or coffee cups, taking empty dishes away, clearing empty tables pretty fast to seat people quicker.   Price is understandable for the food quality which makes this place feel very NYC/downtown- breakfast spot. The weekend environment felt loud and crowded, but not too busy. I didn't feel pushed in too close to others and I felt the staff was very attentive to our needs.   I will definitely come back soon and with more people to this place!"}
{"text":"It was expensive for mediocre food. They had recently changed their menu to become \"upscale\" per their hostess, which I feel has diminished the quality of our experience. I have talked to previous customers who agree that this change was not warranted. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food and service exceptional! Parking is difficult very busy place and a tad pricey. The food is local and organic which is great. Will go back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town we were told to check out this restaurant.   It was worth the trip.  Food tastes amazing.  Service was good too.   I am giving it three stars because this place is simply has not gotten it together yet.  The decor, bathroom, setting/ambiance, etc. is all simply not good.  The ceiling is stained and falling apart. The bathroom was labeled with a piece of paper and \"bathroom\" written in pen on it.  They could get some simple speakers and hook up an I-pod on shuffle for some atmosphere.  As it was there was no music playing the night we were there.  Also we sat down at 6:30 and left at 9:20 - almost three hours is a bit much for a four-course dinner.  We weren't in a hurry, but they need to pick up the pace a bit.   The prices are very steep here;  I know other reviews have complained or even justified the prices, but some of it seems out of control.  I know quality and not quantity is a good guideline, but for my pork tenderloin, I was literally given a piece that was two bites big.  Not big bites either.  There is minimalistic and/or nouvelle cuisine and then there simply not enough food.  This was a simple pork entree that should have had a bigger portion.  No liquor license yet either which is not good.   The food is good even amazing, but this whole place is a tad overrated in my humble opinion and needs to get the rest of the restaurant on par with its food and prices."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have been here more times than I can count - a Saturday morning doesn't feel right without Blue Door! The permanent menu items are so, so good but the specials are always amazing. The french toast/pancakes, quiches, and omelette are always unreal. My fianc√© has a hard time leaving without taking a chocolate pistachio croissant to go. Taking pastries to family gatherings is always a hit too. I'm going to miss this place so much when we move!"}
{"text":"I heard about the Blue Door on Instagram and was instantly intrigued.  Depending on your route, venturing to the Falls is an opportunity to glimpse the amazing Cuyahoga Valley National Park. And if it isn't on your way, take the scenic route when you leave! I persuaded my usual brunch buddy to make the trip and we were both very glad for it. The wait wasn't long at all that Saturday morning. I instantly loved the charming atmosphere. The food was delicious! I had the quiche, which was served on a bed of arugula. The texture was lovely. My companion got the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs and a fresh croissant the size of your head! I stole a bite and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't greasy! I usually avoid croissants because of that. This croissant was a revelation! Tasty, flaky perfection. If you're not in the Akron area, I encourage you to make the drive. You'll thank me later ;)  PS: the coffee and mimosas were excellent!"}
{"text":"I've become keenly aware of the obligation to support local businesses and the Blue Door is certainly a place I'd like to support. However, upon my last visiting found the menu to be overly pretentious and out of touch for the area. Sadly my wife and I were seated in a crowded area nearly on top of other diners and were then ignored. We left after 15 minutes when no one took our drink orders or offered any assistance. I would recommend the Village Garden restaurant jus a half mile north of the Blue Door if you actually want food AND service."}
{"text":"The Blue Door use to make me so happy.  A friend and I use to come here every few weeks as a little brunch treat. We didn't mind the wait for a table on the weekends and we felt that the higher price point was justified. We looked forward to it so much. I recommended this place to just about everyone I know.  However, a few months ago the breakfast/brunch menu changed. I was told by one of the servers that the chef who use to only do their dinner menu was now also planning breakfast and lunch.  The biggest reason my friends and I have stayed away: NO MORE FRENCH TOAST. There's just no point now. Now they often have a waffle or pancake on the menu and are charging upwards of $15 for it.  The whole thing makes me upset. I feel like Cuyahoga Falls has lost a little culinary jewel.  No thank you."}
{"text":"The Blue Door serves sensational food for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  The kitchen staff has been heralded in national publications and given stars and accolades every year. Each year the staff and food seem to elevate the exceedingly high expectations of loyal customers who travel far and wait happily for sumptuous croissants, excellent cuisine, and extraordinary baked goods and heavenly coffee.    ,"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this little gem. We came all the way from near downtown on the way to see friends, and decided to stop off here. I wasn't sure about what this place would be like.   I only have one word; amazing.   The Blue Door is a cafe/bakery that sits on State Road in Cuyahoga Falls. They serve absolutely wonderful brunch items, bakery and coffee that is all of highest quality I've ever had.  My wife and I were amazed at not only the quality and quantity, but the great, kindly attitude the people there have towards the customers. That part really impressed me; customer service at it's best. We were treated to great service.   Amazing corned beef hash, croissants, crepes and a monthly rotating menu of amazing stuff to offer (The savory chicken and waffles is just...wow...) This place was a really pleasant surprise.   I can't say this enough; go stop at this place if you're in the area, and YOU.WILL.NOT.REGRET.IT.:)   Want a door to flavor, great food and great attitude, just find the Blue Door in Cuyahoga Falls!"}
{"text":"This place is now called The Blue Door, FYI. It is very, VERY good. We drive here from Cleveland just for breakfast, that says something. Everything is baked in house. The menu is constantly changing and evolving, always different every time I come. There are always inventive specials and they source most of their ingredients from local farms. I have thoroughly enjoyed my meals here, although the service can be a little overwhelmed and therefore slow. It is just such a busy place, I get it. Maybe the hostess could be more careful not to triple seat, although I do recognize it cannot be avoided in some situations. Regardless, I am pretty sure I would show up and persevere through anything to savor the tastiness that is The Blue Door."}
{"text":"It's almost a year later since my 2 star review which WAS much deserved at the time. After many months of trying new breakfast spots we have wandered back to BD.   My 2 biggest issues last time seem to be a non issue now. The hostess area is much better ran and they get the job done quickly. They also seemed to have hired the right amount of staff to take on jobs so one person isn't trying to do 20 jobs by themselves.   My 2nd issue was the food. I remember my poor quiche sitting there for a good 30 minutes and then it being microwaved by the waitress. We haven't had anything come out cold- or anywhere near 30 minutes! Even on a packed weekend we usually have our food in about 15 minutes.   Overall, much, much improvement!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and it was great. Great selection of unique breakfast foods and good service. Our server really understood the menu and was able to make useful suggestions. Also overheard the server with a table next to us and he was so patient, helpful, and accommodating with what appeared to be very picky eaters.  The food was delicious and the baked goods were an added perk.   Every dish I saw come out of the kitchen looked amazing and made me wish I could taste them all.  Love that they use fresh, real ingredients!  Definitely will stop by this place again!"}
{"text":"The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery is an unexpected treat. They make everything from scratch and are very friendly. They have the most delicious bacon that if you asked about they would probably be able to tell you about the pig it came from. Their hot chocolate and chocolate milk are to die for. It was our first time there and the owner came out and told us all about the restaurant. It was a very wonderful experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite place to enjoy breakfast. We used to go here every week when we lived closer. Now that we live in Cleveland the drive is far but we make a point to visit this amazing spot when home visiting family. The dining room isn't large and the popularity makes the likelihood of having to wait for a table on the weekend high. It is well worth the wait though. I wish that I could only recommend a few favorites but to point you in one direction would be unfair. Everything is amazing. The staff and service you will receive here is second to none. If you haven't already decided to stop by and enjoy breakfast/brunch you should head there now. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let's live review this restaurant.   First,  we were told it would be a few minutes to be seated- it took 20. Apparently if you put your name in and you leave,  they still hold your place when you eventually return. It was cute that they had coffee out if you are waiting,  except it was out of regular coffee and cream.  The waiting area is right on of the eating area,  which is extremely uncomfortable.   I was able to watch as tables stayed open and the staff had no sense of urgency to clean the tables.  Then,  the menus. What the hell is up with the actual menu?  The grammar on it was atrocious and it took me a minute to not only figure out the prices,  but also the read what was in the dishes.    On onto the dishes.  What a load of pretentiousness.  There was not a single thing on the menu is that looked decent and not insanely over priced. I don't have the menu in front of me to call out specific dishes,  so sorry.   We ordered a cup of coffee and found out that there's no refills.  $2 for a cup of Joe and no refills? Fiiiiine,  well get a French press and 2 waters.  That's better priced.  We get the coffee,  but no water.    My husband ordered the french toast and I ordered a side of cottage cheese and strawberries.  He was going to order the croquet madame,  but the unpronounceable cheese was just Swiss.    While waiting,  we look at the bakery case and see some old lady handling the goods bare handed. No tongs,  no gloves,  not even daintily handling them.  She's got her fingers all over the rolls. Eeewwww.   Oh,  we're drinking coffee now.  It's the light roast and  pretty good,  but the flavor is weak.    Oh hey food! My cottage cheese looks weird.  I stir it and there's not a single lump.  It's like they pureed it.  I'm not gonna lie,  I just sent it back.  I didn't even try it.  Creamy cottage cheese is not the same of pureed cottage cheese.  The husband's French toast was so thick it was under cooked.  $14 for 2 thick half slices? Way too much.   The girl that dropped off the plates brought us waters.  I returned the cheese thing and hubby's French toast.  He wanted his remade,  but she was so clueless and bitchy she just took it away.  The good news is that the actual server came back to see if we wanted anything else and got his French toast remade well.    The server seemed to realize that I'm pissed and that we're generally unimpressed,  so she quickly got us the check (as it was,  hubby's $14 French toast was maybe 15 bites)  and cashed us out.    Now I'm off to find myself some breakfast and hubby some more food."}
{"text":"I  met two friends here today for lunch. Everything was perfect and the portions were huge! My only complaint was that although they have ample parking, there are no marked handicap spots. Also, there is no name of the on the restaurant, although the front is painted blue! I enjoyed a Bloody Mary ($6) and a Bacon & Egg Croissant ($12). The latter was delicious with the avocado spread."}
{"text":"Huge, gorgeous pastry both inside and thru drive/thru. Follow on FB to be aware of specials. Cheese Danish was amazing and the croissants are the size of your head!   Update 9/18 - wonderful French bistro, reservations  suggested on weekends. 20% off from 12-3 on sat & sun if you mention seeing it on Fb. The hot chocolate is def a must and worth it. Amazing croissant covered in Brie and fig jam."}
{"text":"I made my 7th or 8th visit to The Blue Door recently (Jan '14). I've been pleased with this place every time I've visited. The food is outstanding. I was very happy on this latest trip to see they've been making some major improvements to the seating area: new tables with nice marble tops, and a better seating arrangement. They can now seat more people, yet it is still very comfortable. The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful in explaining the menu items and making a couple recommendations."}
{"text":"While visiting the area this weekend a family member and I found ourselves asking, 'Where's a good place to get some grub before we go home?' A quick search brought up fantastic reviews for The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery, and we figured we'd check the place out. So what did we think?  Yes - this place deserves its rave reviews. Absolutely.  We were a little afraid when parking that the wait would be long - the lot was totally full! - but we quickly parked, only waited about 10 - 15 minutes during the super busy Sunday brunch hours to be seated, and knew when we saw a menu while waiting that anything we picked would hit the spot. The normal menu looked delicious, the specials looked fantastic - it was really hard to choose what we wanted!   Ultimately we went for a Vegetarian Croissant Monsieur and the lemon & blueberry French toast. While waiting for the meal (which admittedly took a while but wasn't unreasonable, either, given the crowd) I sipped on the most amazing cup of hot chocolate I've ever had - milk, Europe block chocolate, and a few other ingredients basically equaled perfection in a mug. The food? No complaints at all - everything was delicious. The Vegetarian Croissant Monsieur was surprisingly light and had the perfect balance of sauce, eggs and cheeses; the French toast was covered in blueberry sauce, blueberries, lemon cream and almonds - no syrup or butter necessary there!  We didn't take anything home from the bakery seeing as we rolled out after the enormous meal, but everything there looked fantastic, too. If you're feeling patient and you're willing to deal with some noise and a crowd, this place is absolutely worth your time. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Michelin star chef in the back cooking your food says it all. The plates come out looking like someone put thought to the dish. Flavors are balanced in each dish, chef combines just the right things to really make each item on the menu shine. The service is impeccable from the time you walk in. I was very surprised to find this gem in such a small little town."}
{"text":"Times are a changing at the Blue Door. I've been coming to the Blue Door ever since I moved to Ohio but after today's visit I think I'll be coming much less often.   Folks let me warn you, the menu has changed and maybe a chef as well. NO MORE FRENCH TOAST, salads with croissant sandwiches instead of fruit option and other changes.   Not a big deal I guess but what changed my mind is how the staff treats their guests. The staff demonstrates behavior of self entitlement. The staff has a hard time understanding that the changes may change their clientele and they feel entitled to try to convince you to see the changes their way.   No worries, the food is still nice but check out the menu ahead of time if you are coming only for a specific dish."}
{"text":"I have never ordered something that was anything but spectacular from here. Everything is unique, fresh, and all the employees are so kind. My only criticism is that I wish they had more coffee selections. Would love to come in and have a latte with my breakfast, or even more than one roast at a time would be great."}
{"text":"This was my second trip and it was even better than the first. Thick cut bacon and endless Angel Falls coffee are a must. I had the yogurt blueberry pancakes and they left me wanting more. We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"All of the food is so fresh. I got a Mexican inspired dish and my husband got regular bacon and eggs (he's low carb so limited choices for him). He said it was the best bacon he ever had. The coffee was French press, and I'm not a coffee fan at all- makes me gag- this coffee was amazing. We will definitely be going back. I wish they were open for dinner too."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast!   Best quiches and the bacon is everything.    Will like it even more if CFO ever votes to allow alcohol on Sundays!     Love it!   Just go and order everything!"}
{"text":"So my sidekick of the other gender included this as a stop in a little weekend chill-away. Had brunch, my selection was the Croque Monsieur with egg. Can u say bite-your-fingers? Gorgeous flaky buttery fresh perfect croissant, fresh local organic innards, nice size, and fresh local fruit side. She had the breakfast hash, also \"delishiuis\" I stole as much as I could transport across the table. If this place of food-goodness wasn't an hour away I'd be here every morning."}
{"text":"Excellent for breakfast. Try the french toast, grits, cinnamon rolls, or pretty much anything else. Easily the best place for breakfast in town. Excellent for breakfast. Try the french toast, grits, cinnamon rolls, or pretty much anything else. Easily the best place for breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Really good chicken and waffle. Chicken was nice and tender. Only sad part about this place is they don't serve alcohol on Sunday."}
{"text":"I luv this place! Yea it may feel a little crammed when they are busy but the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"It's not much of a looker from the outside, but it teaches you not to judge a book by its cover. Once you get inside, it's warm and inviting. The staff were amazing and the food was absolutely divine. Our dining party went with the chef's tasting menu and every course was amazing. However, the dessert course was very inventive, but it missed the mark. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was great, I ordered the bacon and egg crepe.  The eggs were light and fluffy and the bacon was nice and crisp.  My husband ordered the croque Madame, also very good.  The best part of the dish was the potatoes, although lacking a little salt, still very very good!  I should also add the balsamic on the salad was spectacular!   The only downside to this restaurant was the either owner or manager standing behind the counter with her arms crossed glaring and staring at the patrons.  Hide her in the back!"}
{"text":"5 stars isn't high enough.  You will seldom find a place with as much love injected into its food as the Blue Door.  To be clear, this is NOT a place for \"diner\" breakfast people looking to read the paper while they guzzle cheap coffee.  This is NOT a place for people whose main criteria is \"How much does it cost?  Can I get my biscuits and gravy for 3.99?\"  This is NOT a place for people who like egg white omelets and dry commercial toast with skim milk for their coffee, or boring oatmeal and iced tea with Splenda.    The Blue Door is a \"destination restaurant\" for people who know and understand what real food is, and are aware the higher costs that making and eating it entails.  This is a place whose expertise is so great in what they do, that they pack the house day after day despite being located in one of the most drab, ugly strips of businesses outside of Detroit.  This is a place that is so confident in what they do, that they go Euro-style with their schedule, closing twice a week (Mon and Tues)...Wed.-Sun. will be hectic and profitable no matter what, so why not program in some regular rest for the employees?   The Blue Door is a place for the true food-lover.  Go to the Blue Door if you like the sound of fresh farm eggs with deep orange yolks, thick cut smoked bacon, fresh-baked croissants made by a little Austrian grandma in the back, and specials that include things like home made breakfast gnocchi with grilled New Zealand lamb chops, shrimp and grits with jumbo prawns, and brioche french toast with grilled peaches and creme anglaise.   Go to the Blue Door if you like the smell of rich coffee, baking bread, and bacon.  Go to the Blue Door when you are not in a hurry, and have time to look around and watch the culinary creations trickle out to tables around you."}
{"text":"Not much to say. Had fairly average expectations but this place was a complete surprise. The variety was amazing and the brunch was beyond the ordinary. 10/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"It looks average at best from the parking lot, although it is usually packed with cars. This place is great for breakfast/brunch/lunch. I love that each menu option tells you where the main ingredients are from. It's all local and delicious!  I felt guilty for going back to my one true love, their granola, every time I ate here. It's served with yogurt, milk, and fresh fruit. My sick addiction to this menu option finally changed when I ventured to try their grilled cheese on this amazing bread with sun dried cherry, golden raisin, and pear compote and cave aged cheese.  Their staff is all very attentive and have great attitudes. The whole experience feels wholesome."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal the steak on the steak and eggs is steakhouse quality.  I tried the croque madame and it was also tasty. I highly recommend if you're in the Akron area"}
{"text":"We had a superb dinner experience last night.  We have had many breakfasts and lunches at Blue Door but this was our first dinner.  And what an experience!  Excellent food beautifully presented, fantastic service and the atmosphere is peaceful and pleasant.  Simply elegant.  What a treasure in our area.  This will not be our last dinner there!"}
{"text":"Fresh farm to table and sea to table options. Great coffee, and excellent service. The food is outstanding."}
{"text":"The ingredients used in all of the menus choices are top quality for sure. Very pleasant staff and an unassuming atmosphere. We enjoyed our experience and will be going back. However I feel the two money symbol isn't accurate for a real comparison of any area restaurants. My husband ordered simple eggs and toast as the least costly item at $10. The bakery is incomparable to anything around in a wonderful way, just be prepared for 5 star pricing. We were sticker shocked with a $30 breakfast for 2 not including the tip."}
{"text":"I've been inspired to try new and different places in and around Akron. Came across The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery. Subdued lighting and light jazz playing. I'm really looking forward to breakfast.  Got the hash with housemade sourdough toast. It turns out the coffee is from Angel Falls Coffee Company. It is an exclusive grind for The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery.   The bacon is Nueske. It is a thick cut and \"served at the Whitehouse since JFK.   Ben, my server, was knowledgeable, friendly, and fairly solicitous.   The hash was nothing special and I had high hopes for the sourdough but it was just okay.   I got a marzipan croissant as a dessert. Ben bagged it up to go even though I intended to eat it here.   I will come back to sample more from the menu. I think I liked the idea of The Blue Door Cafe more than the reality."}
{"text":"The coffee here is good.  The inside looks very rustic and nice.  The outside looks like any other place, you have to kind of know this place via reputation or yelp.  Croque Madame: Great. Enjoyed it. The croissant was very buttery and the mustard wasn't overpowering.  Corned beef hash:  it was very good. I'd get it again.  The croissants at this place were amazing.  I would go back for a cup of joe and a croissant.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The BEST food, service, bakery items, overall amazing. I recommend this to anyone. And I go very often! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place."}
{"text":"A really great local restaurant. They benefit their community all while offering some delicious breakfast/lunch selections. Had the crepes the other day with choice of Nutella or homemade jam. Was so good! Also came with a serving of delicious fresh fruit. Hot chocolate is a little pricey but really great. All in all I would definitely recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch and breakfast. Not the cheapest lunch but high quality food and filling portions. The Cuban sandwich was delicious and the French influenced crepes were fun. Outdoor seating. We'll be back. We lived in Paris so it's rare to find a place in Ohio that feels a bit like France. This is it. Great coffee and drinks too!"}
{"text":"Travelled cross-country and this is the best breakfast place by far. So glad it is in my neighborhood. The runner-up would be Polly's Pancake Parlor in New Hampshire."}
{"text":"Fantastic, somewhat upscale breakfast with a French twist. Nice ambience, good service and great coffee. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"So delicious. My husband had the roasted eggplant omelette, and I had the Eggs Benedict with (in house!) smoked-salmon. The English muffins (also made in-house) were the best I have ever, ever had.This place is incredible. We are lucky to have something like this in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"We have visited the Blue Door on several occasions since moving from Portland, OR to Akron.  Trying to find a \"foodie\" cafe was something I didn't was very realistic.  Much to my surprise, The Blue Door did just that!    Between their croissants and their locally sourced produce, there is truly no better breakfast (that we found anyways).  Add in truly excellent service and unless it's a tuesday (when they're closed) there's no other place to go for breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"Possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. The atmosphere of a small town diner with the food of a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow what a hidden gem! This place is such a rarity for being located smack dab in the middle of Cuyahoga Falls.  The food is beyond excellent/fresh. Everything's Organic. They don't even own a freezer... The Chicken and Waffles are a must! David the general manager was so nice to us. He welcomed us, got us sat and made sure to gather our plates and ask us about our experience at the end of our meal. Came back today for the 3rd time and Ian (server) was awesome! Very friendly and good at his job. Thank you. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I took a small group of 12 here today on New Years Eve for an early breakfast. It gets better...5 were little children.  They put together 4 tables for us and waited on us so patiently.  Even when a glass if water got knocked over, they were right there ready to clean it all up. The service was awesome.  Wesley was our server and he really was great at recommending menu choices and catering to our every request from butter to hot sauce.  He definitely earned his tip! So for all the other yelpers that had bad service...they didn't have the pleasure of our server.  Let's talk about the food...read the reviews and was excited as I love foodie places.  I am not the organic loving farm to table, egg needs to have been laid today kind of foodie but I appreciated the story and concept that they offer.  The presentation was beautiful for the steak and eggs, crepes and the quiche which always sells out was spinach and blackberries. The corned beef hash and eggs was plentiful and packed with flavor.  The little girls ordered bacon and eggs which came with croissant too.  The bacon was so thick and yummy...don't know how they managed to get it crispy.  They were like pieces of pork steak! Coffee was strong and hot. I have 0 complaints.    Thank you for having us at your restaurant for breakfast...we will be back !"}
{"text":"This place serves great food. They have a bakery and they just go from there. The specials change frequently but you can to look them up on facebook to see what they are from day to day.  Today they had a New Orleans theme. I had the rib eye poboy with mustard creole sauce and red peppers. It was sublime. I didn't really recognize it as any poboy I had ever had, but it was one of the best steak sandwiches I have ever had.  I have been here several times and have been wowwed by the food each time. I had the croque madame on a fresh croissant on one occassion. Holy crap was it good.  Service can be a little spotty. Water might not get refilled, I was served food without utensils once. No hanging matter. I just put on my big boy pants, walked up to the counter and asked for what I needed. They cheerfully obliged.   Rude service or wait staff that has to finish a text before they can deal with you is one thing. That is not what is happening here. They are busy. When you try the food, you will know why."}
{"text":"HOLY moly. What a gem of a brunch place. This places gets so much business, they don't even need a sign in front - they literally just have a blue door - which made it more difficult to figure out where I was going. This is by FAR one of my favorite restaurants. They have both a classic menu that they always have and a rotating menu that changes every few weeks. Every time I have come here, (which is once a month since I moved to Cuyahoga Falls), I have gotten a new item on the menu. Oddly enough, I always have the same server, Kyle, who is kind and explains the more unique dishes that I've never heard of before. Every item I've gotten has been delicious. It's always packed, though, since it's really popular. It's a little bit pricier for a brunch/breakfast place but it's worth every penny and I would probably pay even more. All of the ingredients are fresh and local. Not to mention, they have fresh baked goods. I recommend this to everyone I meet and have taken so many friends here who have also loved it!"}
{"text":"My Mom likes in Akron and recommended we try Blue Door for brunch on Sunday.  From the outside, it is not much to look at - typical for the economically depressed areas around.  Step inside the eclectic bakery and enjoy the Northeast Ohio hospitality...  When the Owner (?) heard it was our first time, he took time to explain that they source all of the ingredients locally - they know all of the farmers personally - and they don't have a freezer (which is funny way of saying your food is all fresh! :)  At our Server's recommendation, we tried the local apple cider served hot.  Perfect for a cold December day!  There is a Specialties section of the menu that changes often.  The menu leans towards German dishes - jagerschnitzel, etc.    My brother had the hanger steak and eggs.  They cook the steak sous vide before finishing with a searing for perfect medium rare.  It came with a housemade steak sauce on the side, but I didn't care for it.  My wife had the quiche lorraine and a side of tomato soup.  Both of the previous items were on the Specials menu, so YMMV.  I had the corned beef hash with eggs perfectly cooked over medium.  My choice of bread was two slices of 30-year-old sour dough.  Any place that serves Kerry Gold butter is an automatic 5 star yelp for me!!!  Sadly, we could not indulge on alcohol because they aren't allowed to sell on Sundays before noon YET.  They are putting it on the ballot next year. The other side of street has alcohol.    This has now become a must-visit when we return to the 330!"}
{"text":"This was the 3rd spot on our \"local exploration tour\" in Cuyahoga Falls. Since visiting France, this was the next best croissant I've ever had. And the Lobster Benedict. EVERYTHING!! Their food not only tastes amazing, but is also good for you. Fresh, quality ingredients with BIG flavors. And their customer service is what every dining experience should be. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and gave great meal recommendations. The only possible downside is that Blue Door only holds an occupancy of 49 ppl so the wait at peak time (Noon on a Saturday) was around 30 minutes. But after dining here, I realize I would gladly wait that 30 minutes again. And since space is limited, I somewhat expected to be \"rushed\" during our meal but that didn't happen whatsoever. Needless to say, Blue Door is officially added to my list of favorite brunch spots. Not only in Northeast Ohio, but just period."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Had the Caramel Corn French Toast, it was delicious. Great chocolate milk too! Only downside is that Blue Door is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Wonderful corn beef hash and mimosas. My girlfriend got a blood Mary and it was spicy and wonderful. Great atmosphere and staff was friendly and fast.  Price range is $$$ out of 5. But your getting organic and farm fresh food. I will be coming back very soon. A real gem in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"Ok this place was a total surprise ...out of the blue (no pun intended!).  We were looking for a warm dry place for breakfast on a rainy day and Yelp (or fate) led us to the Blue Door. We waited about 45 min but we were fine with that...because really ...who wants to eat in an empty restaurant! The owner is impressive and very organized...he asked us if we minded if sat a larger party before us at a bigger table and then apologized for our wait... How refreshing to have that level of concern for your patrons. Now the food... The ham croissant was the most amazing breakfast sandwich ever... Holy Moses!!! The right combination of savory and salty and melty (I don't know how else to describe it.. Oh and I added an egg to the sandwich and that was the right move!). The ham was out of this world. The French press coffee ...soo good...and the bread (because of course I had to get a loaf to go) ...wow !!! What a gem of a restaurant. They are doing everything right.  We will be back for that croissant sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Any well-regarded restaurant in the Cleveland area inevitably has someone from a far away city who says \"this place is terrible, if only local people knew what food should be like\". This is not one of those reviews.   I come here every time I'm in town, there's an attention to detail in the food that's uncommon and in a place outside the city center like the Falls difficult to find. I always find the staff charming. The owner/chef Michael Bruno is friendly and personable, chatting us up while we waited during the Sunday brunch rush and telling us about the work he put into improving the pastry over the years.  I haven't read all the reviews here, I imagine not every review is perfect, but this establishment is focused on a great product with great service and I wish there were more places like it."}
{"text":"Good tasting fresh food.  In season items on changing menu.  Staff friendly, clean, Unique."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and warm, friendly service. Baked goods are super special here. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious, seasonal fresh dishes. Took a box of baked goods home for the kids to devour."}
{"text":"This place is a great treasure in Cuyahoga Falls! In town visiting friends and came here for a late breakfast. Friendly staff and amazing food. Our table had the chicken & waffles, streak & eggs and Olympian plate; all amazing with no complaints. The sour dough toast also extremely good. I would come back here daily!"}
{"text":"After seeing the high reviews on yelp we decided to check this place out. They have a small parking lot, drive thru for their fresh pastries and bigger than your hand croissants. The inside is intamite and cozy with minimal decor. They have nice outdoor patio for extra seating. Service is great especially for as busy as they are. It's nice to see them using fresh, organic, free range, local ingredients.   We ordered:  Chicken & Waffles ( jalapeno & cheddar waffle, southern fried chicken, ohio maple syrup, whiskey butter, house made hot sauce and organic blackberries). The chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly, the hot sauce and maple syrup  complimented it perfectly. The waffle had great flavor as well, for me I wish it was cooked a little longer.  Down East Lobsterman's Quiche (maine lobster, organic leeks, sour cream, crispy speck, peach & cilantro chutney and bruleed grapefruit). The chutney and grapefruit were amazing, the crust of the quiche was buttery and flakey, overall it was cooked perfectly. I just wish there were more than three small peices of lobster for such a large quiche.  Croque Madame (rosemary ham, bechamel, swiss, mustard sauce and a fresh egg). Now this was the star of the show. Everything came together fabulously. First the huge perfectly buttery and flakey croissant, savory ham and runny yolk, mmm and the mustard sauce rounded it all out.   Corned beef hash (corned beef, smoked bacon, onions, potatoes and two eggs). I ordered my eggs over easy, you just have to have a runny yolk with hash. Well one egg was cooked perfectly and the other was overcooked. The hash itself had great flavor, to me it seemed the corned beef had very tiny little pieces and the bacon not much bigger. To me a hash should have equal size potatoe to meat. Just my opinion. Overall great experience I see why everyone raves about this place."}
{"text":"Good food, trendy atmosphere but seating is a bit snug.  They need to find a more spacious location."}
{"text":"Blue Door has excellent fresh made food.  Everything is made from scratch and it maybe a wait to get a table but it is worth it.  They even have vegan dishes."}
{"text":"This quaint, welcoming restaurant is a New England throwback in the heart of the Midwest. Orange juice, bacon and eggs are pedestrian, but not in this case. This is far from the fact. Fresh juice, organically grown chickens yielding bright, colorful eggs and sweetly spiced bacon. Exquisite! Worth your time for a balanced, satisfying meal. Yum!"}
{"text":"Used to be really good. This place has flopped. The corned beef hash was my main dish, but the food is now meh. Service is still good, but food is more important me. Please bring back the good food. What kind of breakfast place doesn't have French toast? The blue door."}
{"text":"The Blue Door was wonderful. I have a foodie friend who knows my husband and I are also foodies and he has been telling me to give it a try. We made the leap on Easter. I thought it may pan out to be the worst timing, but it was perfect. Beyond the tasty and esthetically pleasing food, the staff was wonderful. The man running the door when we walked in made us feel like they had been waiting on us to show up, it was the sweetest thing. They have mastered the art of making a small crowded space feel warm instead of hectic. Such a gem, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I would move to this little town based only on this charming cafe. We had eggs and hash and it was superb! We went there randomly on our road trip based on others comments on yelp and I am really pleased we did. There was a small wait  but was totally worth it ... someone wise told me, if there is a line get in it! Side note... I wish I had more room because they bakery goods looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"5 star food and 3 star service.  I want to give it 5 stars... the specials... the quality... the diversity... but oh the service...  Pick out a pastry from the case in the front before you sit down... or at least look the case over... your server may... or may not... have a clue what options are available at the moment... and it changes quickly as they try very hard to keep up with the demand on the busy weekend mornings.  The wait will be worth it if you happen to be there on a busy day... but it is easier to manage with a chocolate croissant to tide you over.  Beverages are also an issue... my husband doesn't like the brand of natural soda's they carry... and some of the servers only refill their own table's coffee... so we end up beverage-less by the time the meal comes.  If the parking lot doesn't look too full... or you have a leisurely morning to spend... it's a great place to start the day!"}
{"text":"Quick summary: definitely come in to grab some baked goods; theyre out of this world. Avoid sitting down for hideously overpriced food and drinks as they are prepared with zero care.  Went for brunch with family after our friends really talked this place up. The visit was difficult in terms of logistics as the parking was full and the wait was long, but this was expected so it didnt throw us off. The issue, sadly, was the sub-par food. Ordered shrimp (special) and while it was plated beautifully it arrived frozen in the middle. The way i would imagine it would be if defrosted in the microwave, but Im just guessing here. Three shrimp plus microgreens for $17. Moving right along, the potatoes with meat (some equivalent of corned beef, the exact name escapes me) was so salty that hubs ended up not eating it. The specialty lemonade (at $5 a pop, natch) was bottled lemon juice + water, none of us drank them. And while the staff was overall friendly it is surprising to see that the waiter failed to question us when he cleared the table and all the food and drinks were almost untouched. Best part of visit was the woman behind the bakery counter (i was told shes the owners mom?) who was joking with my son and feeding him delicious pastries as we waited."}
{"text":"I want to thank Ben on awesome service!! He, Kyle, (and I am regrettably forgetting the long-time female server who is always smiling!) provide consistently exemplary service. For any one not familiar with BDC, the wait is worth the meal! Even though I moved to Columbus this past year, I try to make it back here for breakfast or brunch when I'm in town. Customers- come back regularly for the rotating specials!!"}
{"text":"Always good. Food is fresh, service is good, and the menu changes enough to keep up with seasonal options. I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Great place."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative review I would. This is the worst restaurant within 100 miles. The servers are mediocre at best. I ordered my eggs over EASY and got medium and when I asked for new eggs I was told they were too busy. The apple wood hash tasted so bad I could not finish it nor could I wash it down with my cold served coffee.   Don't even get me going on their prices. Easily the most expensive breakfast in Summit County.   What a waste of time."}
{"text":"*** updating my post to 5 starts after a recent visit. They made the menu larger. The coffee cups bigger. The portions way bigger ! The staff is always phenomenal. Already planning my next visit !"}
{"text":"NEVER had a better glass of chocolate milk than I did here - it's made with German chocolate!  I really respect the farm-to-table concept, but the congestion of the parking lot, entry, to-go queue, register, dining space, and neighborhood is just way too intense for a pleasurable meal."}
{"text":"An adorable location right on a corner. The inside is intimate and simply decorated. The patio is tight but was nice with the warm weather.   What a fancy breakfast. It was pricey and you don't get a lot for your money but I was surprisingly full when I left. I got the breakfast sandwich. $9 for just the sandwich-man it was delicious flavors though and the croissant was the best I've ever had. Definitely could split that and something else with someone so you don't get sick of the flavors. The side of potatoes ($4) not worth it, so tiny. Mom got the cherry Danish -guys this thing was HEAVEN and big!!!!! It tasted like fresh cherry custard in the middle and it was only $3-that was the most reasonable item we ordered so we may just return and get a bunch of bakery items to go, maybe even at the drive up window (which is awesome).   Bottom line: couldn't be a weekly breakfast spot due to price but is a nice place to take your mom or a guest in town visiting. Will stop by and pick up some bakery if in the area."}
{"text":"I'm very torn about this review -- on one hand, the food was great -- everyone in our party was very satisfied with their selection, and the menu selection was excellent.  I walked out the door ready to give an enthusiastic review and make plans to return.  If you are going to have open windows to your kitchen -- please remember that people can see your employee sneeze into her hands and immediately go back to working pastry dough.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you like fresh and local places this is a great place.  The breakfast is always filling and freshly prepared.  I highly recommend the corn beef hash and anything with a croissant.  Only rub is the wireless is kind of spotty."}
{"text":"This was an incredible dining experience! The best ingredients, most wonderfully prepared, in a diner atmosphere! Highest recommendation !"}
{"text":"I love this quaint place. Everything you get is delicious! Seating is semi limited so if there is a wait just be patient and kind to those serving you."}
{"text":"Favorite and best breakfast place in the Akron area! Get the corned beef hash!!! I've been to a number of breakfast places in the Akron area, and this one is far and away the best. In a lot of my reviews I say \"you won't be WOWed\", here you will be WOWed!"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place on my Yelp for the longest time as it was recommended by Cleveland Magazine as one of the best breakfast place around Cleveland area. My husband and I finally made it here on my birthday weekend. My review for this restaurant consists of four parts show below:  Food: 4/5 The food is good here. I somehow may get the dish that I don't like much. I cannot blame this to the restaurant as I personally don't like mustard and this dish - Croque Madame - has the mustard on it. My husband breakfast sandwich was delicious though. I like to come back again so I can try the other dishes and I can make this review more precise. For this visit, I have two comments for the food.  1) I think their croissant is overbaked or overtoasted. This is again not a restaurant's fault or mistake. It is purely my own personal preference. I like crispy croissant but it should not be too crispy to the point that you can taste the bitterness from over toasting.   2) The almond filling in the almond croissant is not balance with the gigantic size of the croissant. Their croissant is literally the size of small cabbage, but the amount of almond filling was probably one or two tablespoons. The unbalance between the size of the croissant and amount of the filling just took away the deliciousness of the almond croissant.    Price: 4/5 I think their food is a bit too pricy for the breakfast place, but I have to give their credit on the quality of food ingredient and their attention in cooking. I can tell that the chef and his team work really hard and pay high attention on each dish they sent out from the kitchen by the look of the food and the decoration.    Service: 4.8/5 The service is phenomenon. Our waiter did a superb job waiting our table. He was very energetic, attentive, and knowledgable about the food he served. I also impressed with the restaurant manager who took time to walk around the restaurant to  greet, check about the food, and thank to all customers. The only reason I took 0.2 points out from the service is that I wish the restaurant can come up with better way to manage the waiting list. It can be by texting the customer when their table is ready, so that we don't have to hang out near by the entrance for the whole 20 minutes. Their restaurant do not have seating area for people to sit on while waiting. I cannot imagine what people do during the winter on the snow day. Any lastly, I wish the restaurant add the reservation option so that we don't have to wait for the table.  Atmosphere: 4/5 The restaurant is pretty cute, cozy, and clean. It is however a bit tiny, probably due to the amount of tables that they try to put in. It felt somewhat clutter.     Overall, I think this is a good breakfast place. My tip for people who have never been here and plan to come are below:  Tip#1: Don't come with an empty stomach. Get banana or a cup of coffee before heading to the restaurant, so that you don't get too cranky from being super hungry while waiting for your name to be called.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic Brunch!! Came here this morning with a friend for brunch and loved it!! Great atmosphere, we sat outside on the patio to get away from the crowd inside and enjoyed the sunshine! My friend got the quiche special which was bacon and avocado and came with tomato soup and potatoes. I got the bacon and avocado croissant sandwich which was divine!! The bacon at this restaurant is phenomenal and so thick and tasty! I loved it here and will definitely come back for more tasty treats!!"}
{"text":"If I could use one word to sum up my experience at BD, it would be, \"wow.\" This establishment has, hands down, the BEST breakfast I've ever had in Ohio.   As soon as you walk through the door you're immediately greeted by friendly people and the smell is HEAVENLY. There's a fine array of fresh made pastries on display as well, that will leave your heart immediately palpitating and your taste buds screaming for their hunger to be quenched.   I ordered the corn beef hash and it brought me back to my grandma's German cooking, and my time spent in Germany last year. I love love love that they make their hash with cabbage.   My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and omg, it was so SO yummy! The waffles were killer and I love the touch of jalape√±o and onion grilled into the waffle. The blackberry and jalape√±o compote to accompany the waffle was also superb.   I will definitely be back to eat my feelings through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Bruch food as it should be. Strange and somewhat unfortunate location, but well worth seeking out. Without doubt the best breakfast/brunch anywhere nearby and as good as anything in more foodie friendly environs. The service was perfect--friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Every item was expertly prepared; the menu creative without (too much) pretense. Probably impossible to be pretentious in this location, which keeps the restaurant grounded with a warm atmosphere. The ingredients were all locally sourced and/or carefully chosen. Coffee was good. Recommend without any hesitation and will go out of the way to visit whenever nearby."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had.   I got the *Special - Eggs Benedict Alaska - Wild Sockeye Salmon  -I'm thesalmondude, so I had no choice but to try the salmon at The Blue Door   -It was amazing, that's all.   I also got a crepe with organic bananas and Ohio honey.  -crepes are my favorite meal -The Blue Door gets a 10/10  -service 10/10 -food 10/10 -price doesn't even matter"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been good. The place, overall is managed very poorly. The food is great, the menu is great, the people and the management are terrible. If there's a wait you have to gather at the front of the restaurant in the parking lot because they only yell names out; no text message; no phone call.... gather and wait. I've never experienced anything like it. When your quoted a wait time it's not real. I went back in and was told \"were working on this page and your way down here on this page\". That was how they estimated the wait?! They have to be making tons of money, but the interior is run down as well. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Blue Door for a while now, 'discovered' it this summer and haven't been able to stay away. I'm kind of ashamed that I haven't reviewed them sooner.  It's a tiny place with no sign on State rd in the falls and without knowing what it was, you'd probably never look twice at it (besides maybe to wonder why this mundane looking building's parking lot is PACKED to the brim).   The food is fresh, clean, and solidly executed. The ingredients are locally sourced when at all possible, and one of their main suppliers, Brunty Farms is my go-to for all things chicken and duck related.   Their eggs benedict, which I had today, is phenomenal. Perfectly poached eggs, Leoncini ham, and toasted brioche make what is truly the breakfast of champions. The only modification I'd make is to add a spicy salad to the mix (with lots of arugula....but I have an obsession with arugula, so never mind me).   I've had the pleasure of trying their Reuben when I went there last week with a friend, and it was truly one of the best I've had in a good long while.   The service is generally very good even when the place is packed (to the point where they're setting up make-shift tables and there is not a single parking spot). The specials are daily, so I feel like I need to buy a house around the corner so I can be there EVERYDAY. And I would, if I could. Blue Door is just that freaking good."}
{"text":"We've been to the Blue Door several times for breakfast and LOVE IT! The food is always delicious! Sometimes the service is a little slow getting to the table and your needs, but we still love this place. We ate here for dinner as well for our anniversary last week, and everything was delicious! I had the pork and my husband had the duck. We also loved the virgin cocktail drinks. The service was very attentive on this night. The owner is really kind and friendly as well. You should definitely check this gem out! It's really the only place I go and don't modify my order because I know it will be wonderful no matter what!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal dinner tonight at the Blue Door- seriously one of the best meals of my life- Charlie Trotters chefs table territory. The Blue Door blows any Cleveland restaurant out of the water (yes-way better than Lola's) and the place was empty!  Dinner started with hearts of Palm salad- bleh, right? Wrong! These guys imported FRESH hearts of Palm from Hawaii and pickled, grilled, and pur√©ed them with an amazing lemon vinegarette- WOW!!! Delicious breads, Amazing Stilton and goat cheese with poached figs, a summer corn and tomato dish that was the essence of summer on a plate, wild boar cooked perfectly with truffles and pur√©ed sunchokes- seriously flavorful stuff! Oh, and I raved so much during the meal they gave us an extra chocolate souffl√© to shut me up! These people are heroes. These flavors will transport you- their creativity will blow your mind. Visually you will be enthralled. You will feel like all of the meals you have eaten before this one were equivalent to gruel.  People- drop your dinner (or breakfast or lunch) plans and invade the Blue Door Cafe- you will not be disappointed!  Oh and ask the owner about his stove- fun story!"}
{"text":"I have dreams about their croissants! Going to blue door cafe for brunch is the only reason I ever agree to go hiking in the parks. We've generally gone as a group of 5-7 on a weekday at 9-10am. Sometimes we're seated right away, and sometimes there's a wait of up to 45 minutes. They have a bakery in the front, so if you're super hungry and have to wait, I'd recommend their giant croissants!  Everything I've had is always delicious. The portions are big too! No sharing for me, but I'm usually either stuffed or have leftovers. I've had their corned beef and monte cristo, both are delicious! They also have specials, so there's always something different.   The parking lot is pretty small and we haven't found a great place for overflow parking. To the best of my knowledge, there's not much street parking around there..."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my top 5 favorite restaurants. If the owners dream was to open an amazing European style cafe... they've succeeded. The food is truly fantastic! Great service, amazing presentation, and consistent. This is the kind of place that ruins other food for you. You'll exit and realize how truly far we've fallen as a culture. Because...why can't all food be this good?"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast spot in Cleveland and Akron! Everything is made from scratch."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Our server Kyle was very personable, and patient for my brothers arrival. The place was hopping, and I see why! The atmosphere and the food was great! I had the chicken and waffles, and my brother had their burger special. I had a ganache filled crescent heaven of a pastry, while waiting for my brother... we are both out of town, and happy to have come to this little gem, before our hiking trip! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were on a hunt for a good donut shop, but stumbled to this, and thank goodness we did! It was perfectly quaint. It was busy on a Saturday morning (11AM) but for a party of two we got in much quicker than I expected.  It is a popular spot for all ages! The service was so kind and attentive. They were definitely busy, but managed to check in on us.   I watch thee biggest pastry pass by me as i was looking at the menu, and got distracted. Come to find out it was \"just\" their sticky pecan roll. It was as big as my face, and I'm a grown woman! I knew then i had to get a pastry. I opened for the almond croissant, and it too could've fed a family of five!   On top of that, we ordered the spatzel and blintzes. The spatzle was phenomenal! I wanted to keep eating it... but i was so full! The portion was large! My friend got the blintzes which were so good too. The lemon ricotta cream was a bit sweet for me, so i only ate half of one, which was good!   We definitely over ordered (ps i was told the hot coco was great as well), but that croissant was worth it! The almond paste was perfection. I will say it is a little pricey, but you pay for what you get! Also the seating was close quarters but if you love food, you won't even realize your neighbors cause you'll be enamored by your food!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place, but it left me feeling empty. My parents had been here before (dad loved, mom not-so-much). It was cute and the menu looked interesting and appealing. I ordered the chicken and biscuits and was highly disappointed. My dad settled for the fruit and oatmeal and loved it. Mom got the crepes and was less than satisfied. Presentation was really good --- food looked more appetizing than it actually tasted.  Server was friendly enough, but clearly she was given too many tables as we (and others) were highly neglected; not her fault, and I felt bad for her. As we were leaving people were actually complaining about the poor service.  I would probably give this place another shot if I am ever in the area again, and would recommend it for it's orginality if nothing else."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Akron! Their proton size is great and the quality of food is as good as it gets. I honestly wish I could eat here every day"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this gem of a restaurant for the first time this past Sunday.  I wanted to take my mom somewhere special for breakfast/brunch as it was her b-day and upon doing a little research I decided on Blue Door Cafe and what an excellent choice this turned out to be.  The hospitality exuded by the staff we encountered as well as observed was outstanding.  From the moment we stepped in the door we were greeted with the most welcoming invite by the gentleman host.   It was jam packed and it was obvious that the staff is accustomed to handling this type of crowd...they have a structured and organized system and everyone worked hand & hand helping one another out.  I believe we waited about 40 minutes for an available table and O-M-G the wait was worth every minute.  The food was OUTSTANDING!  It was plated and presented so beautifully that we felt guilty eating it.  I enjoyed a quiche, breakfast potatoes and salad while my mom enjoyed shrimp, grits, egg over easy & roasted pineapple.  I consider myself a food/restaurant connoisseur and this place has been added to my top 5 favorites...I cannot wait to return to enjoy another one of their delicious creations!  I'm always super busy and usually do not take the time to write reviews about my restaurant experiences but had to make an exception for this one!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people! Looks small and busy inside but they were very efficient. It is obvious they put a lot of thought into the menu and ingredients. I wanted to try everything. Get a cinnamon roll to take home!"}
{"text":"Grabbed breakfast with a friend while we were in town briefly and could not be more impressed! I usually default to a savory breakfast, but I wanted a lighter fare, and went with the Tartine. It came with 3 crepes, fresh berries, and some dipping sauces (including Nutella). Definitely hit the spot and the crepes weren't too sweet at all. It was elegantly plated, and I enjoyed it fully. Also can't wait to try the chocolate croissant I got to go!"}
{"text":"My family and I were so pleased with the service and the food. Our waitress was always nearby to fill up our coffee. The food was out of this world! We would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.  No other words are necessary but I'll toss some in to meet the guidelines.  This place is remarkable for being where it is here in the state of Ohio.  All of the breakfast food is prepared absolutely perfectly and all of the pastries are the best I've ever had in my life.  If you go here you MUST get a pastry, any one of them is fine.  My wife and I are pumped to go here for one of the dinner experiences."}
{"text":"Tried this place this weekend with some friends after reading the Yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint. Everyone was very friendly and courteous, and the host (who may have been the owner?) spent a few minutes explaining the concept of the restaurant and menu to us. We all tried to something different and everyone loved their meal! I had the crossiant monsiour with an egg, and it was delicious. The side of fruit was fresh berries, not just the flavorless cantaloupe/honeydew melons you get at most places. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and thought oh that would be a great place to go, and so I went. I was told there wasn't really a sign, just a blue door and there it was. Props to them for being able to not even have a sign but have a great restaurant. Walking in was completely different than I thought. The atmosphere was great. Sitting down I looked over the menu and holy organic/vegetarian their menu was packed with healthy choices. Plenty of choices for whoever you are and whatever you like. I would say this place is very boujee but still gives you enough for what you're paying for it."}
{"text":"This is really good food made with care. This isn't IHOP. They use quality ingredients. I think it's expensive, but you're paying for higher-end food. If you don't mind dropping $15-$20 on breakfast, and you want quality options, you should go here."}
{"text":"Wow! Extremely busy and still delivered great service and even better food! The owner is very personable and takes pride in his restaurant, and our server was top notch. Will definitely come back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow! We agreed the generously portioned wild salmon \"hash,\" farm fresh perfectly poached egg dusted with nano greens, buttery fingerling potatoes and a side of resonantly fresh just-out-of-the-garden artisanal greens made for the best breakfast we had ever enjoyed. Kudos to Hollywood CA chef, Jimmy Pintiello for this specially and carefully prepared gluten-free and dairy-free delight.   We were so entranced by pastry chef-owner, Michael Bruno, and his colleague, Bria Liberatore's beautiful baked goods that we took some home for family members. The service is friendly.  The special trip to Cayahoga Falls was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My review has two parts, one for brunch and one for dinner. The meals have different chefs and styles of dining. The breakfast is excellent. There are some standard items along with specials for variety. One thing I'm happy about is they now have pancakes, my favorite breakfast food, on the menu more often, where as they didn't so much before. Pancakes are how I measure the quality of a breakfast place, and The Blue Door's are some of the best I've ever had. Their other dishes such as French Toast or corned beef hash are also excellent.  Dinner is a whole different style from lunch, with white tablecloths and a special four-course menu each week. There are normally two choices for appetizers, soup/salad, and dessert, and around four for the entree, including vegetarian. What I like about the arrangement is that each time we go I get to try something new. Recently when picking a restaurant for my birthday I went through a bunch of restaurants from nice Cleveland restaurants. Nothing jumped out at me. I finally checked the Blue Door's menu and immediately saw things I wanted. We went and had a great meal.  By the way, come Valentine's Day we went to the upscale Pier W in Lakewood, because we do like to try different places. While it was good, we both found ourselves thinking that we would have had an even better meal at The Blue Door and saved ourselves a long drive.  The Blue Door also has a bakery up front, where you can get real good bread and a variety of sweet rolls.  Regarding pricing, breakfast is $$, dinner is more like $$$$. In both cases you get real good food for your money."}
{"text":"Though I do not go very often due to it being above my budget. This place is amazing. I have been going here since they opened and can not recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday morning. Wait wasn't two bad. About 15 minutes for a table for two. I enjoyed a plate of the corned beef hash while my boyfriend ordered the Monte Cristo. Both  dishes were delicious. The fresh fruits were delicious and the pastries are equally amazing. Love the ambiance as well. Highly recommend for a lazy weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Variety of excellently prepared and delicious unique meals.  The coffee is fabulous. The service was friendly and professional.  A top notch place."}
{"text":"Ah, The Blue Door... Such an inviting, cool place to start the day, or end the evening, now that they do dinner on the weekends.   The interior is simple and clean, yet sophisticated. I love how pure it is and I'm happy they don't put art up on the walls just to have art. Less is more here in every way.   The vibe here is very hip & vibrant with diners of all ages and food interests. The selection of breads and pastries would make anyone drool and I don't even have a sweet tooth. The menu is simple and certain to delight everyone. Be sure to ask for their daily special menu.  Seeing the parking lot full with diners lining up outside brings me joy knowing the Blue Door is here to stay."}
{"text":"Have moved to Cuyahoga Falls about 9 months ago and have been dying to try this place out after all the hype. Unfortunately it did not live up to its reputation.   The good: my server was very nice, attentive, and the food came out fast.   Now the bad: I ordered the hot chocolate while I perused the menu and it was more lukewarm than hot. I eventually decided on the french toast special. It was horrible. The french toast was cold, dry, and he custard did not soak through it at all. Basically it was regular toast. The pastry cream and creme anglaise served with it were not sweet enough to complement a sweet breakfast dish. It looked beautiful but could not live up taste wise. And just these two things were over $20!  Honestly I my breakfasts and nearby First Watch and Flury's Cafe were much better.  Will not likely Be back. Might try a croissant from the case or drive through but I don't think worth dining in"}
{"text":"A little pricey but it's definitely worth the freshness of their food. I tried their kiesh last time I was there and it was so delicious! I will definitely be going back sometime soon. Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend in a Saturday for brunch so we did have about a 30 minute wait but as soon as we were seated someone immediately came over to us with water and offered us coffee. Our waitress was extremely kind and answered every question we had. Initially I was sad because they did not have the bee sting french toast so I had the chocolate petite french toast instead and it was absolutely AMAZING! The presentation and taste surpassed my expectations! The environment was friendly and welcoming and price matches the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I have only paid this much for breakfast once and that was in NYC. My husband and I both ordered 2 eggs, bacon, toast and coffee. He ordered an extra side of bacon and we split a very small helping of potatoes. The bill came to $35 with tip $7 the total was $42. You only get 1 small slice of toast....1. My over medium eggs were so runny they weren't even white it was clear and ran over my plate. I thought these chefs were top notch. Cooking eggs is pretty basic. The coffee was truly no different than the coffee I make at home. I just don't get the hype. Maybe we should've ordered the pumpkin omelette for $"}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. Went on a Saturday about 10:30 and no wait, however the parking is insufficient.  I ordered a special, french toast/croissant with a hazelnut or coffee/chocolate spread and cherries. Very good and I would order again. Very filling. The coffee hit the spot too, I must have had 2 cups at least. The bacon is the biggest bacon I've ever seen and the 3 others in my group liked their dishes also. The only complaint was before our food came out we requested a side of the potato croquettes and the waitress forgot about them and we did too until after eating. We really wanted to try those! (But gave us a reason to come back, so we can deal with it) I was expecting the bill to be much higher than it was, so I was overall pleased with Bluedoor and would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I had a Monte Cristo that I would describe as remarkably bland. As one of the least expensive lunch items it was terribly overpriced at $12. I also had the Artesian Greens which were quite light but very plain. Fortunately there is salt on the table, because I needed lots of it to bring out any flavor in anything.  The decor in the restaurant reflects the blandness of the food. There are no decorations on the bland walls. Trim is missing although you can tell it used to be there. There is a mismatch mix of furniture that may be an attempt to be hip, but it pretty much fails in light of the blandness of everything else."}
{"text":"great breakfast and the service was great.  It's not your normal breakfast but almost like fine dinning breakfast food."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this establishment!!!... I'll start with the staff - the manager Dave was extremely polite and helpful when I called with less than two weeks notice trying to book reservations for a large party on a Saturday morning for a bridal breakfast. On the day of our breakfast our waiter was so so so great (wish I could remember his name!). He was very charismatic and funny, and politely patient with our large party- so nice to be helped/ served by someone with so much genuine personality and not a disengaged uninterested person behaving robotically. Moving on to the food... Oh my!!! Everyone loved the food.. LOVED it! From my 80+ grandmother , to my 1 year old nephew... Full tummies and big smiles all around. The Mushroom / squash omelette was what i ordered and it was the best omelette I've ever eaten in my life. Other orders in the party that I know of included the French toast , eggs Benedict , and \" bacon and eggs\" .. Seriously, everyone LOVED their food and that's next to impossible with 15 people. My mom and my aunt flipped out when they learned that the \"creamer\" provided for hot beverages was actual CREAM.. Manager Dave, on one of his multiple visits to our group to make sure we were all happy, told us that the cream was made fresh just for the \"blue door\" . In summary, EAT AT THE BLUE DOOR."}
{"text":"-1 for prices. -1 for service. -1 for atmosphere.   I'm pissed off. I'm quitting smoking right now and probably should've stayed at home, but gf had the day off and I'd been wanting to try this place.   Note: first off, our waitress was just a little \"off\" and a little slow to refill drinks, etc, but the customer next to us - the weird looking chick - had no right to yell \"excuse me! I don't have brown hair!\" and hand her plate to the server like a dick! No one deserves treatment like that. That woman should've stayed home. Maybe she's quitting smoking too?   Prices: are stupid, I'm sorry! It's just too high for this area. Doesn't seem to stop people from coming, though.   Food: whenever I try a new place, I usually start with something on the safe side. My croissant was good, but it was topped with bacon/eggs/avocado and I couldn't help but think that I could easily make this at home. It seems pretty obvious, though, that someone knows how to bake at this place. The one other topping - the avocado vinaigrette - was tasty and would be nice on one of their fresh salads (saw another person's salad and looked good). Looking at photos from other yelpers (sorry, is that what we call ourselves?), I feel like we missed out on some delicious seafood dishes, etc. I'm sure that there is good food to be had here.   Service: not very friendly, but not rude, either. My gf asked if they had refills on tea and it seemed like she just didn't want to have to deal with it, but reluctantly asked if she'd like one to go. She also seemed truly perplexed when I asked about Specials.   Atmosphere: I'm not much of a hipster until it comes to music. This place was playing conventional top-40 music and it just did not fit at all! Why are the tables so close together?! We came at a time where they were not busy and, unfortunately, had people on both sides of us like we were at Hibachi Japan. Thanks to seating arrangements, we got to witness that awful, aforementioned customer, then the rest of my dining experience was ruminating on whether or not we should call this horrible human being out. This is not NYC and it's not busy - spread us out, please.   Will never be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service every time. Always look forward to whatever new menu items will show up on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"My brain has a hard time forming coherent words about how awesome this place is. It's bright and sunny inside, and I was immediately taken with how much work has been done since the days it was a kitschy German restaurant. I don't consider myself a foodie and definitely had no idea what some of the things on the menu were, but that's where the extremely nice waitress came in - very helpful and knowledgeable.   I'm vegan. I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich, and the waitress painstakingly made sure that I could eat everything on the sandwich. And then, the owner himself came out to double check. I'm used to ordering something without the cheese, getting the cheese anyway, and then being told that I can \"scrape it off\". So I can honestly say that I love it here if only for how attentive and knowledgeable they are.   Everything is local and organic. The bread is cooked in house, specials are perfectly in season and it's all SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS. My sandwich was so good I'd lick the plate if that wasn't sort of frowned upon.   Only complaint: the service was a little slow. But everyone was so sweet and the experience here was so nice that I hardly cared."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened what must've been about a decade ago. Every time I come home I make sure to meet a friend here for brunch. It is so good and the menu is constantly changing. I've never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast 2day.  You get lots of food, except bacon.  We ordered a side of bacon for $4, this included 2 pcs of overcooked bacon.  Not a fan -$40 for 2 people to eat breakfast and get 2 pcs of bacon?  Absolutely never going back.  For good breakfast, go to village garden."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area on a weekend around lunch time, and my friends found this place on yelp as one of the best establishments to get brunch.  What a great choice!  The restaurant apparently offers a changing menu of specials, with each special sounding delicious (and ever so difficult to choose from!)  I split an order of egg benedict with fried oysters along with an order of beignets, which came served with fruit and various dipping sauces (nutella, lemon, and I believe strawberry jam?).   The eggs benedict were rich and delicious, and the beignets were soft and sweet.  The waitstaff were busy but nice, and the establishment itself was pleasant, although not much to behold.  Of note, at the side of the restaurant was a bakery, serving lovely looking pastries and croissants.  A friend and I split a chocolate croissant prior to our meal, which was fluffy and delicious.  Overall, everything we had was tasty, and I had a lovely time."}
{"text":"The dinner tasting menu was excellent.  55$ for four courses.  I loved the red snapper with mushroom broth.  The cheesecake was also superb.  The risotto and zucchini salad were good.  The place does not feel pretentious but the food is beautifully presented.  If in Cuyahoga Falls this is definitely a worthy dining choice. It worked we all as a dinner pre concert at Blossom but if you do the tasting menu you should have 2 hours at hand."}
{"text":"I've traveled back and forth across this country and have eaten at some of the finest restaurants from coast to coast...but there is nothing quite like the Blue Door back home. We eat here any chance we get when we're in town visiting family and it never disappoints. The love and attentiveness is obvious in each unique dish. The creative culinary minds that work here are some of the best in the country. The Blue Door is and will always be my absolute favorite place to eat. Crazy unique dishes, a constantly rotating menu, unbelievably delicious and consumer conscious meals. Ya know if I'm ever on death row, they'll be getting a call from me."}
{"text":"Very recommended .... What a great cute place to have breakfast in. Food was so good. The staff are friendly. I liked the idea of they change their menu every week. I bought some bread from there. It's defiantly one of the best I had.  It was my first time going there, and for sure not my last."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here today. I was looking for a \"surprise\" restaurant, and this was it! The food was great (I'll get back to that) and the waitress was busy but very friendly. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. The waitress forgot to give us our check, but it didn't matter because the food was so amazing! My wife started with eggnog. I got water, but had to order an eggnog after I tasted hers. It was as though I was drinking heaven. So rich, sweet but not overly so, and altogether perfect. We both ordered from the specials menu. I ordered pork roulade, Because of the reviews I'd read, I also ordered 2 pieces of bacon. My wife ordered wild caught, spotted sea trout.  Both dishes were cooked to perfection. I don't know exactly how to describe this food. It was sooo good. All of the ingredients paired up perfectly. Long story short, the meal was fabulous and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is easily, easily, the best breakfast food I've ever had. My wife and I went recently, and I ordered the chicken and jalape√±o waffles with whiskey butter and homemade hot sauce. O-M-G! I've ordered chicken and waffles at other restaurants and never really \"gotten\" the dish. This worked so well together! The sweetness from the syrup paired so nicely with the slight burn from the hot sauce. The chicken coating was crisp, but the chicken was still moist, and that savory waffle is exactly everything I wanted it to be. I won't even try to name exactly what my wife got. It may have been a special. I believe it was ricotta pancakes with fresh whipped cream, lemon sauce and maybe pecans or walnuts.(again, I don't remember exactly, just that it was great as well! Lucky me, I got to finish it because she was too full!) She said it was slightly too sweet with the lemon sauce and the maple syrup, but I thought it was terrific, and she is admittedly more of a savory breakfast fan."}
{"text":"The food and service here are phenomenal. Their overall food philosophy is incredibly impressive. Most of their menu changes everyday and they make a serious effort to incorporate healthy, local ingredients. Everything I've had here has been excellent. The croissant madame and grilled cheese with tomato soup are superb, as is their fresh baked bread. Their brownies are fantastic too. Very chocolatey but not too sugary. The servings are very generous for the price, especially given the quality of the food. The atmosphere is charming as well. Very minimalist, but super nice and clean. They have a patio too, which is great. This by far the best restaurant in Cuyahoga Falls. I cannot possibly recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"A 5 star rating experience except for when they're slammed and even then it's incredible. Fun casual atmosphere. I would recommend to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"should be called the gold door! 15.49 for bacon, eggs, toast and coffee! Tip and 18.00 total"}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Awesome atmosphere. Awesome food! This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Ohio. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My 1st time here was not good! I came back a year later(today) and I was pleasantly surprise! The food here was phenomenal and I would recommend everything... especially sticky buns"}
{"text":"A little taste of Europe in the Falls!  Though some might complain that Blue Door is somewhat pricey for a brunch hot-spot, everything is worth it. They have a strong commitment to fresh, high quality, locally & ethically-raised/grown ingredients. All of their baked goods are EXCEPTIONAL. I can't say I've ever had such delicious croissants or english muffins.   Absolutely the best brunch spot in the greater Akron area."}
{"text":"I was visiting Akron from Florida and jogged to The Blue Door for breakfast because I was swayed by other reviews.  I am a huge \"foodie\" and my boyfriend is not, so I went on my own gut feeling.  The food was absolutely delicious!  I had the corn beef hash, which was a hearty portion and perfect.  The challah bread was AMAZING with their homemade strawberry preserves, which were so good that I wanted to finish them with my spoon!  Overall, the meal was so good that I went back the next day and brought my boyfriend with me.  The Challah bread french toast was fabulous as well as the blueberry pancakes.  The portions do not look large on these items and the price appears a little high, but they are perfectly filling because of the way that they are made and worth the price because of the ingredients.  If you are a foodie, you can appreciate that!  The place was packed on Saturday, so the wait time was longer, but the service was still good...it is worth the wait.   I would tell everyone in Ohio to go!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are foodies - and eat here at least 2 Sunday's of every month.  Chef Torsten has done an incredible job with the food here!  We used to go to Tremont/Ohio city until we heard that this place was just 10 minutes away!  Food - 5/5 - amazing standard dishes and weekly specials that they change up every week.  I'm not a dessert for breakfast kind of guy - but their waffles are sooo good!  Atmosphere - 4/5 - It's a little worn (ceiling, bathrooms) but it's not necessarily bad.  Kind of what you expect at a brunch spot?  They are working on it (I've been told), but it doesn't really make a huge difference - at least for brunch!  Staff - 17/5 - These guys are top-notch.  Every waiter/waitress we have is super-friendly, always remembers us, and we rarely, if ever, find ourself waiting for coffee/water.  Kyle is the man - ask to be seated in his section if possible."}
{"text":"Both the food and the service were absolutely wonderful. The chefs 4 course sampler is definitely worth it, and is a great experience. The food was delicious, creative, and high quality."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite restaurant and the dinners here blow us away every single time. Nothing comes close in the area.   The food, the service, the atmosphere is all top notch."}
{"text":"I recommend Blue Door to everyone I know. The specials are so delicious and unique, and so are the permanent menu items. I also love their blueberry iced tea from Angel Falls Caf√© (Akron). I've never been disappointed, even as someone who goes later in the morning or early afternoon when specials start to run out. This restaurant is truly a fresh breath of air in the pretty bland array of choices of NE Ohio."}
{"text":"Blue Door is a hidden gem in Cuyahoga Falls. I can't stop coming back for their unique and fun take on brunch. The service is excellent and I always leave happy. I've never gotten anything that I didn't like and am always more than impressed by their food. The menu changes frequently, which is great because it means I can try something new every time. Definitely a must eat for the Akron area!"}
{"text":"Fresh food made to order. Lovely European influenced food. My favorite is the delicious Guatemalan French press coffee. Love their ever changing menu."}
{"text":"This is the best possible place to have breakfast/brunch/lunch while visiting the scenic trails in and around Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Not only was the service friendly and welcoming, the food itself is like taking a weekend trip to Europe...if Europe had chicken and waffles, that is. The vegetarian options are amazing (the croissant with zucchini, egg, and gruyere cheese is high on our list), and their bakery is world-class. If you are really lucky, you will have the chance to meet the owner's mom, who tends to the bakery and drive-through: She is both quiet and friendly at the same time. The owner himself is incredibly humble and talented, always serving new and seasonal options on his ever-changing menu. The wait can be long, but for a very good reason: The food is incredible... Don't be hangry with the staff if you have to chill for a while!"}
{"text":"We drove 50 minutes to come here and it was worth the drive. I had the bacon and cheese croissant. It's was amazing. The croissant was delicious, much like the ones you get in France. My husband got the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes, which he enjoyed. The lemon curd and chantilly cream really made the pancakes special. The staff was extremely friendly too. I will definitely be coming out here again!"}
{"text":"Came here on Yelp reviews. Not disappointed! What a menu. Drooling while reading it. The Monte Cristo did not disappoint. Way too much to eat at once. I took half home. Delicious hot chocolate too. My wife had the croissant. Also delicious. Home made chips, nicely salty and crispy, not greasy. The whole place smells so good when you walk in.  Ran into the owner on the way out. He's got lots of plans to spruce up the place, over time. Please go, enjoy the delicious food so he can do the upgrades. This is the type of local place I like to frequent to support local merchants.  Fresh, imaginative food. Local ingredients, where possible. Everything that can be home made is home made.  I will definitely be back here. It's a little far from home, but close to my wife's office. Lunch in the near future.  I have NEVER commented on another yelp reviewer's review, but I find the review by Eryion H. a little hard to believe. I stand by my rating."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed today with my visit to The Blue Door!  We sat outside on the patio and it was perfect.  Our waitress was quick and attentive and I could't believe how fast our food came out.  Their menu is small, but the specials seem to change every day.    I had the croissant monsieur with egg and just about died after the first bite and went to food heaven.  Also, the house made chips seriously pack a crunch then immediately melt in your mouth.  Can't wait to come back next week after church!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I lived closer, because I would be here weekly! Maybe it's best I don't live closer, actually, because then I'd be quite overweight!  Everything I have had has been amazing. You can tell by the presentation that the cooks take pride in what they do. They offer a lot of healthy options and local foods are incorporated in their menu. I promise you that whatever you order, you'll be happy with.  It can get quite busy, so go early or be alright with waiting. It's a small place, and feels intimate when you're there. They also have pastries up front you can purchase to go.  The service has been warm and friendly every time we've been there. I can't wait to go back and take some pictures of what I order and post another good review :) but really, if you're wondering if you should go, yes. You should."}
{"text":"I really liked the mission statement of The Blue Door, and found the restaurant to be an extension of what the owner's values regarding their commitment to using local ingredients to create innovative, yet simple dishes. I will certainly be back to support this locally owned business.   The servers were very friendly and helpful, and even though there was a bit of a line on a Saturday morning, they seemed to get orders out efficiently and we didn't end up standing in line for more than ten minutes.   I ordered the grass fed steak sandwich, which was amazing the first 5-6 bites, but as I ate the second half, I was \"over it\". I think it may have been due to the fact that the bread had become soggy and there were several slivers of the meat that were too red for my liking. The cup of chicken soup was underwhelming and expensive at $3 for about 4-5 ounces of soup. My husband's french toast was delicious and he ate the entire thing. We took home a fresh loaf of ciabatta, which was perfect in every way.  I look forward to returning and trying more items on their menu, specifically their breakfast fare, since it seemed to be the most popular and all the orders coming out the kitchen looked delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They are pricey, but honestly it is worth it. The portion sizes are huge and food is delicious. Everything is farm to table and fine dining, so that's what you're paying for. This is my go-to place for croissants. They have the BEST in town (that I have found anyway). They have a drive-thru window too, which is perfect for Monday mornings on the way to work when you are in dire need of comfort food (pastries). Every time I go in the staff is beyond nice as well. I took my 70 grandma and mother recently and the staff was great. They made sure my grandma could get around with her cane and was comfortable. Really great place to check out!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best non-chain brunch restaurant in the area. But compared to places I've tried in Cleveland and Columbus, the food was just okay for me. The hash browns were pretty salty, and the french toast was so-so. Our waiter was nice but it was difficult to get his attention, ie. to get the bill or a refill on coffee. I thought for the quality of the food, it was quite over-priced. But I mean there's not much competition in the Falls area, so I guess it makes sense to set those prices. I would give it another chance, but wouldn't rank it high on my list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Totally worth they hype (and the drive, if you don't live nearby).  Yes, it is crowded. Yes, there is a lot of people. Yes, that's what happens when places are good, so go to The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery in a relaxed state. You're going for brunch, chill out, the world ain't gonna end and you're there to enjoy a beautiful Saturday or Sunday morning.  From the door to the table everybody had a smile on their faces and an awesome attitude. The menu has so many good things to choose from, that the difficult part is to choose. I had the wild salmon salad, which, apart from being beautifully plated, was as fresh and deliciou as you can get in the world. Then I had the corned beef hash with eggs and a croissant and everything was top as well. Finally I finished it up with the sour cherry tart, and once again I wasn't slightly disappointed. Ah, I shared all of this, in case you're wondering if I was training for an eating contest.  Love this place, really worth the drive from Cleveland and will repeat for sure."}
{"text":"WOW! This is truly one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, and I've been to many. Everything about this place SCREAMS quality. It is obvious the chef has a true love for what he does, because it comes through in every delicious bite. Our waiter was Ben Brown, and he was  incredibly attentive without being a pest. He was fun, professional and really helpful. I really do just love this place, and plan to go back often. Keep up the great quality Blue Door!!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, my food has been nothing short of delectable! The French press coffee is great! As far as one of the best things to get, I recommend the chicken and waffles. The sauce that comes on it is so amazing. I've never had chicken and waffles like it anywhere else! The service has always been pretty great too! You guys are doing a great job here!"}
{"text":"My mom and I love finding unique brunch spots, so I wanted a unique place to take here when she came to visit. This is the best bakery that I have found in the Akron area.  I got the corned beef hash, plus a whole bagful of pastries! Everything was spot on, plus most of their ingredients are local and organic! I highly recommend The Blue Door to anyone looking for something different and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast my wife and I ever had. We loved it so much we ended up eating there every day during our visit to Ohio. Food was prepared fresh and in a healthy manner. Staff was incredibly friendly and very well versed on their menu. Even the coffee was above par! I highly recommend giving the Blue Door a try."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place with a great staff. This place is slammed every time I go and with good reason. The food is decadent and the menu lets you know where all of their products come from which is really neat coming from a local restaurant. Every waiter I've ever had here has been courteous, helpful and happy.   I order the French toast every time I come because every time I come it's a different recipe! One time it'll be Nutella and the next it'll be peanut butter and jelly. Sometimes they'll change what bread they use to and it makes me excited to check what's new with the menu every visit.   Also I have to commend them on their coffee, which comes from Angel Falls in Highland Square (the best coffee shop in Akron).   The only downside to the restaurant is that the prices are pretty steep. Granted you get a ton of food and great food at that but your bill can skyrocket pretty fast if you order anything extra like eggs or bacon."}
{"text":"Outstanding bakery, amazing breakfast/ lunch!  The best English muffins that I've ever had!  They are definitely worth a drive across town! Huge and dense and oh so tasty!  Love the Croissant Monsieur, as well as many of the other breakfast specialties.  Hmmm, must visit again very soon, as I've made myself hungry thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Probably the best brunch spot I'll have in Akron. The place is super cute while the service is attentive. I've had veg breakfast sandwich and the steak sandwich ( on 2 different occasions) and without a doubt, outstanding.  My friend loves their coffee which they source from Angel Falls Cafe.   This is a place I'd recommend without hesitation. Its stands out from all the crappy franchises and mediocre food in Akron. These are the types of businesses we need!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I could eat brunch here every day of the week. Always fresh, local foods that are typically quite healthy. Such friendly staff and great prices, which is rare for the high quality food they serve. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can not possibly say enough good things about this place. It took my husband and I a while to get around to going - despite that several people we knew mentioned it and  told us how much we would love it. When we finally arrived we were in love. The food is of a quality that I honestly haven't found in the area before. Their specials are amazing, thoughtful, complex and well presented. The pastries are perfect, french pastries like you can hardly find in Ohio. Make sure you share a croissant while you are waiting for your meal. They do a simple jam & croissant so well....!  The coffee is also good - and I am pretty picky about my coffee. Try the hot chocolate if that is more your thing.   My only complaint is that is it always busy (rightly so) on the weekends when I am in Ohio...."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!!! New favorite place for brunch. Highly recommended for their wonderful service, friendly Owner and staff, and delicious food. Definitely going to visit again!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, guys. Maybe, at 22, I'm just not hip enough for this place. I was here for a business lunch, and I have to say, I was unimpressed by more than just the propositions being thrown at me from the other side of the table. The decor? Nonexistent. Seriously. I ordered the Reuben, which was less than stellar. And it was $12!! The hell? Thankfully, I wasn't paying. This isn't Manhattan, guys, cut it out. The whole feel of this restaurant is off, like an old man's idea of what the \"young folks\" would like. I guess it works...the place was packed and loud. Not for me though, for some reason I can't get into the whole hipster, farm fresh, \"better than you\" thing. The only reason this place isn't getting 1 star is because of the service. Excellent!! My coffee cup stayed hot and full up until I left, and the waitress even made extra trips with a smile to accommodate my associate who HAD to have decaf (who the f*ck orders decaf?!?). So yeah, there's that. Probably wont stop here again, despite my \"two times to be sure\" rule I have. Yuck."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, amazing and fresh food. This place is always crowded. I love having work meetings here on the weekdays as you avoid the rush. I would recommend anything on the menu as each time I try something new and love it."}
{"text":"This is best breakfast/lunch/brunch spot in Akron. Marked only be the blue entrance door angled towards the intersection (no signage to speak of), its almost like you have to know about it to find it and experience it. They've set out to serve food that you don't make yourself and they have met the challenge. The menu stapes are consistently fantastic and the rotating specials are a level above fantastic. The service is friendly, prompt and courteous and they have made good use of the small dining room.  The updates to the furnishings they have done over the last year have been welcome enhancements to the experience and we look forward to going to the Blue Door for years to come."}
{"text":"First time customer and I would give this place an A. We got lucky and did not have to wait. The lobster Benedict was out of this world good. The person who took us here decided to tell us about this place way too late."}
{"text":"There is not much more to say that others have already stated, it would be like beating a dead horse blue, then returning to beat it some more the next morning, because you got so damn tired and passed out the other day from beating the horse...  That stated, this is likely one of the best Restaurants around! Fresh food, made from scratch, no bull crap fillers, and a menu that changes its face like Micheal Jackson (RIP MJ)..... Simply a pleasure to eat! You will not be sorry for stuffing face here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere tends to be lively and the food is great. If you can stomach the cost it's an excellent place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"This is really unique place. I have only been here for breakfast although I believe they do lunch as well. If you are looking for traditional breakfast items like pancakes and eggs and bacon, this is not your place. Everything they have is just a little different, my husband and I tried the corn beef hash. It was really good, but the best part about this place is that everything is fresh and homemade. They had homemade english muffins with homemade preserves and it was just fantastic. You can taste the freshness in everything.   I will say if your looking for a cheap quick breakfast this, again, is not what you are looking for. It's packed, all the time, and for breakfast it is not cheap that's for sure. If you want a quality breakfast that is sure to impress then you will absolutely love this place. I can't wait to go back and try some different things."}
{"text":"Blue Door is expensive, but the old cliche holds true: you get what you pay for. And it's divine. I got the corned-beef hash with sourdough bread and the large French press Honduras coffee. Unlike a lot of diner/cafe spots, they actually bring you fresh cream in a white, porcelain pitcher instead of the cheap plastic creamers. The coffee was smooth and flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed by the reviews calling the Blue Door \"unremarkable\" &, especially, \"too expensive.\" Listen up, Cuyahoga Falls: If you want cheap, unremarkable food, go to an Applebee's or a Chili's or a Panera or any number of other basic chains so common in our neck of the woods. But if you want to try some real food, made with love - not to mention care for the environment & our local economy (farmers!) - the Blue Door is ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE & not at all expensive for the food they offer. It easily compares to places in NYC & DC, especially for brunch, & Cuyahoga Falls is lucky to have it!  I can't name a favorite menu item, because whenever I go (which is sadly not often, as I don't live in town anymore), I try to order one of the specials, which always sound so tempting. I do love their croissants (all homemade!), so any time there's an option to order some sort of sandwich that comes on one of them, I jump on it. Their bacon side is amazing, too - thick, juicy - & so is the potato croquette (crispy outside, mushy inside). If they've got crepes, go for those; if they've got French toast, go for that (can you tell I like brunch?!). My boyfriend & brother both love their Monte Cristo.  Re: some other reviews, lately the folks at the Blue Door have really worked to improve the quality of the dining experience, with new tables & slightly updated decor that better reflects the quality of food they serve. However, it's a small place, so be prepared to wait, especially if you're stopping by for Sunday brunch.   Aside from the wait - good food is worth waiting for! - my one complaint is that they don't serve regular pop, like Coke or Pepsi. Instead, they serve some organic brand (no refills, out of a bottle, etc.), which is not only more expensive, but also less delicious. Though I understand their desire to remain consistent in their local-no-preservatives-etc. philosophy, I'd rather just be able to order a Diet Coke! They only serve regular coffee, too (no lattes or anything like that), so  if I'm planning to get my morning fuel at Blue Door, I have to caffeinate before I go. Bummer.  ANYWAY, the caffeine issue aside, the Blue Door is a gem - probably one that's a little bit too good for the folks in Cuyahoga Falls who fail to appreciate how outstanding it is. But as a native Fallsite who doesn't want to have to go to IHOP for brunch when I come back home, I'm only too happy to have such a great restaurant to visit in my hometown!"}
{"text":"The mimosa was great.  I will blame the freshly squeezed oj but I can honestly say it was the best I ever had. I got the biscuits and gravy and the boyfriend got chicken and waffles. The biscuits and gravy came with a cheesy biscuits (huge) a side of meat eggs to your liking and potatoes. The biscuits and gravy were so good. The flavor was a little different but just enough to grab and hold my attention. The eggs were so flavorful naturally my bacon was good. It a little under cooked for my liking so I didn't eat much of it. The potatos were nothing special. They put beets in with them kinda threw me off.  The chicken and waffles were very good.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and the waffles were packed with flavor.  I saw a lot in the menu that I wanted to try.  I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"First time eating here.  The outside of the building is 'unassuming' but don't let that dissuade you because the food was excellent. The service was prompt and very friendly.  The coffee was good.  We had their house blend but they also have several French press options.  The quiche had a light crust and a pretty complex flavor profile mixing sweet and savory.  The breakfast sandwiches were excellent.  The croissant they came on were light and huge!  All the ingredients were really fresh.  The flavors were a really good mix.  It was not just another sandwich. All and all, we had a great experience and would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience for brunch today!  We had been here for dinner before but this was the first time for brunch.  Everyone has been raving about the breakfast so we decided to go today for my husband's 40th birthday.  Cassidy was a wonderful server and while we sat at the bar immediately, it didn't seem that those who had to wait were waiting very long.  The bakery counter was amazing and we ordered a few things from there to go.  We ate the braised pork belly and lentil omelette and the prosciutto crepe-both were amazing and unique.  We drove 45 minutes to get there and it was well worth the trip!  Best brunch restaurant around."}
{"text":"I only use the drive thru so far, but the service and food is amazing. Quiche Lorraine is soo yummy! Also order the ham and cheese croissants , out of this world!"}
{"text":"French Press Coffee was perfect.  Breakfast was amazing as usual.  Love that you can book on yelp now.  My only complaint was that it was tough to get a table, no worries now that I can plan ahead.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic Bavarian cuisine.  The portions are huge and filling. The hash is amazing. The food is just PRETTY. Go on a weekday before 12:30 because it gets busy. At one point, it seemed like our server disappeared for awhile... it got very busy and loud, but it was really worth it. GREAT food."}
{"text":"The food was very good, high priced but good quality. Don't order the caramel corn French toast as it's loaded with popcorn seeds. The manager took care of it but dental work is not fun. Also they do not take American Express. Come on people this is the 21st century, figure it out either take all cards or take no cards."}
{"text":"High priced with no value. I do have to say that the  croissants were good but at almost 4.00 a piece not worth it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is defined by its daily specials.  Check out their facebook page, and browse through their specials before coming here.  Basically, this place has two menus - a regular menu and a specials menu.  The regular menu is very brief, and basically consists of - eggs+bacon, eggs+corned beef, and a few croissant sandwiches.  I tried the eggs and corned beef, which tasted decent, but it was nothing to brag about.  The specials menu changes every day and has more unique creations such as open faced omelets, eggs benedicts, fish tacos and a different play on grilled cheese each day.  I tried the fish tacos and thought there was too much cabbage and it was a little bland.  However, I think if eggs benedict had been on the menu when I went, I might have developed a different opinion altogether...  There is a large sign that says The Golden Goose with a picture of a goose just outside this restaurant, but underneath the sign there is a bit of small text that says that they are now the Blue Door."}
{"text":"The reviews aren't wrong this place is incredible. The food is all organic, farm to table style and you can really tell after dining. Be prepared to spend around 25 bucks a head atleast BUT totally worth it. Staff was good for them being so busy, manager was classy and kind, and their menu is great. I will be back soon, it really is a hidden gem in the Falls.   Below is the chicken and waffles. Served with a handful of blackberries, a hot sauce, and some delicious maple syrup to compliment their breaded chicken and waffles. Also we tried the mint lemonade, wow so tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. If I could give 6 stars I would. I always get something new because their menu is always changing. As a person who sticks to the same thing all the time you'd think this ever changing menu would be a bad thing, but every single new thing I try becomes my new favorite. The atmosphere is quaint and clean and classy. It's a refreshing place to eat. Great drinks, great food, great staff. And for the love of God, get something from the bakery."}
{"text":"I was hoping this was going to be a place I could go back to for more. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. Upon entering I was distracted by the random strings of white christmas lights hanging haphazardly on one section of the decrepit ceiling. Then on the wall was a strange out-of-place cuckoo clock; It would have been more interesting had it cuckooed, but it never did. Each window has a curtain rod running across it with empty curtain rings on all of them. Suffice to say the decor was lacking and there was no ambiance unless you consider \"old, random, and plain\" an ambiance.  It was crowded with a 20 min wait, but there was no room to even stand and wait. It was a jumbled mess of people standing around competing for space with the people paying their bills at the counter. It was quit an uncomfortable wait and is definitely a deterrent to coming back.  I ordered the vegetarian croissant breakfast  with fresh fruit on the side. The croissant was marvelously crispy flaky on the outside, but a little to dense and greasy on the inside. The egg was fried which was great, but the Dijon that was supposed to add to the flavor was only tasted in two of my bits. It was a delicious Dijon, but lacking throughout. The fruit was fresh, ripe, and sweet.  An utter disappointment came with the cornbeef hash that my boyfriend ordered. Just looking at it the potatoes were overwhelming! Then to taste it, the lack of corn beef and the poorly seasoned potatoes were disappointing.  At least the prices were reasonably. I was a little skeptical of the bakery after the waiter boasted about it being baked by the owner/baker who was trained in \"European style\" bakery. The baked goods in the display did not look anything like the baked delicacies in the windows of all the bakeries in Paris, but I was willing to give them a try. However, as I was waiting in line to pay the check and select some bakery items, I witness an older lady behind the counter grabbing, rearranging, and restocking the pastries w her bare hands. I was completely discouraged at that point and decided not to take anything home.  I might go back, since it was the best breakfast I've had in Akron, but I can bake croissants at home and I was not impressed with this \"European\" bakery or the dishes we had."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best restaurant in Cuyahoga Falls.  I have been there 6 or 7 times for dinner and twice for breakfast/lunch.  I always love their dinner menus.  The four course is at a great price for the quality of the food.  They also recently improved the decor and the bathroom.  My favorite item ever was the tomato water or the tuna which was on one of the summer menus.  The souffl√©s  and macaroons are some of the best.  Best restaurant around.  Only negative can be slow service but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Modern, delicious and cooked with love. I've never been disappointed. I'd go as far to say that this is the best brunch in Cuyahoga Falls. GO! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My first time to the Blue Door cafe was a couple weeks ago, my boyfriend took me there. The place is small but very cute and quaint, it reminded me of a little French cafe. The manager greeted us happily and escorted us to our table. Our waitress Kelsey was wonderful. The mimosa was about as big as my head! So good. I had the Croque Madame which was OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious. The croissants are big and flaky and heavenly. Overall we had a fantastic experience. I can't think of one bad thing. I am going there this weekend again and taking my mom and my boyfriends parents! Can't wait :) thank you Blue Door for an exceptional dining experience"}
{"text":"It's not even an exaggeration to say this is the best breakfast I've ever had. We came on a Sunday for brunch and everything ordered was AMAZING. The only con is you cant order alcohol, what's brunch without a mimosa, not that they can help that. The bacon and egg crescent isn't something to pass up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the coffee! I paired my delicious cup of black coffee with their amazing French toast. My friend raves over their corn beef hash, I think you guys created a monster because she's obsessed with it. 5/5 hands down on the breakfast. Next, I need to try out their dinner I've heard such great things!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best breakfasts I've had in the akron area. Authentic, local, and just absolutely delicious! A bit on the pricier side but well worth the money when you're paying for such high quality."}
{"text":"I wake up and think about The Blue Door's Steak & Eggs w/ an English Muffin. Best in town. Excellent service. Friendly owner."}
{"text":"That food here is really good. It's all freshly made, and mostly farm to table and locally sourced. There can be quite a wait on weekends - - which the waiter made more bearable by passing out free croissants to those of us waiting. I thought that was a classy move."}
{"text":"Just returned from dinner here and I would recommend it without hesitation. They are famous for their breakfast but dinner here is so wonderful! First of all, the care and planning they put into this menu was so impressive. The quality of the food and the ingredients involved was outstanding. My husband ordered the oysters and wild boar and both were great- he was so happy with his selections, I had the Ohio tomatoes and organic chicken. Both were amazing but the chicken was seriously the most delicious dinner I have had anywhere in the area. The presentation and care they put into the plating of the food was of high caliber- the meals were really stunning works of art and tasted fantastic. I appreciated the labeling of menu items for those with dietary restrictions. I am gluten free due to a medical issue and I had no problems finding something safe for me to eat and delicious! They even had homemade gluten free Irish soda bread!   The staff was friendly and pleasant. They really showed a knowledge of the menu. I was blown away by this dinner. I didn't even know they were serving dinner until randomly seeing it online. They are knocking it out of the park on this just like they do with breakfast.  If you are looking for a fine dining experience that is truly delightful, pleasant, incredibly delicious and out of the ordinary, go here for dinner. You will not be disappointed. (Then get up and eat breakfast here the next day, if you can handle that much awesome)"}
{"text":"Not that many vegetarian options but all their food is amazing. Especially their savory and sweet crossaints!!"}
{"text":"Best spot in Cuyahoga Falls for brunch, hands down --sorry burntwood, you're a close second. We have been here a multitude of times and have NEVER had something we haven't liked. Which is wild, because we've NEVER gotten the same thing twice. Huevos rancheros with shrimp has been my all-time favorite. If you catch them on a day when they're serving it, it's a must. All of their quiche is fantastic, and it feels like that word doesn't even do it justice. They always have amazing service."}
{"text":"We go to the Blue Door whenever we can(once a month). The servers are very professional and efficient, my coffee has never gone cold, ever. Everything is made from scratch, where can you find that anymore? Our favorites on the regular menu are the corned beef hash and the monte cristo. One of us always orders one of the specials when we go. We always make sure to bring home some croissants or brioche for the kids to enjoy! Being a serious cook myself who makes everything homemade I can appreciate the time and pride the owner takes in what's on his menu, it's a lot of work. No precooked, vacuum sealed stuff anywhere to be found at the Blue Door."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it changed from Golden Goose to Angel Falls and now to Blue Door Cafe.  The food was okay, but hard to justify the price. Might've rated it higher but the waiter was talking to customers behind us and he criticized people who order the bacon and eggs...meanwhile one of the people at our table had ordered the bacon and eggs.  Pretty rude. I'll stick to Garrett's Mill in Stow or Piatto Novo down at the Sheraton for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best place in the Akron area for breakfast. Service is always amazing. The coffee. Where to begin. There are no words to describe how remarkable the coffee taste. Never been disappointed in any food anyone in my family has had here."}
{"text":"So this was a shot in the dark aided only by positive yelp reviews. Basically, the food was really good, and the brunch/breakfast menu was really creative, which is exactly what I look for. The atmosphere was also kind of cool in an understated, rustic kind of way. However, it was absolutely FREEZING in there. I'm about 95% sure it was colder inside the restaurant than it was outside, and we're talking 30-degree weather this morning. Also, the service was a bit slow, though pleasant. And the bathrooms were a little icky. If they put a little maintenance into the place (AND TURNED UP THE THERMOSTAT!!!), I'd be able to give a better review."}
{"text":"This use to be a great restaurant that was slightly pricey but worth it. It's been a couple of months since we've been here. We walked in for brunch today, the menu has been condensed and the prices have gone up even more. It was $15 for eggs, bacon and potatoes. That was the cheapest thing in the menu. So with drinks, entrees and tip you'd be out $50 dollars for a simple brunch. This is a small town and not Manhattan. They need to reevaluate their status in the restaurant world."}
{"text":"Just had my first visit to The Blue Door. It was worth getting up early. I had the Shrimp and Grits, and my wife had the French Toast. The food quality was absolutely wonderful.   The staff was very attentive, and they took the time to explain menu items and make recommendations. Best of all, they never let our coffee cups get empty (it was great coffee, too).    I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love small local owned restaurants and this is by far the best in town. The food selections are unique and of course always flavorful. The dinner experience was over the top. Both the food and the staff are the best there is."}
{"text":"Loved this spot when we stopped for breakfast.  Unique, locally sourced choices and friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"If you want brunch in Ohio, you MUST go to The Blue Door Cafe & Bakery. Check their Facebook page for daily specials. I love the service with a smile, and they have gradually worked to improve the ambiance and seating (though they still need more seating). Unfortunately, you might have to wait a while on the weekends, and they will not seat you until your entire party is present. Also, parking can be scarce on weekends. Stop in for brunch or to pick up some pastries.  My favorite entree is the vegetarian croissant monsieur. The flavors combine it the most amazing way. Pair it with the delicious, buttery greens for a savory meal. Get some chocolate croissants to go.  I just really appreciate that the staff very clearly care about what they do, and they want you to have a good experience. It is my favorite restaurant of any kind in the area, and I'll continue to go (every weekend) for the foreseeable future.  Tip: try going on a weekday (W-F) if you don't want to have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  But if you are trying to eat healthy, you might want to skip this place.  No healthy options - so go and splurge.  After my post I received a message from The Blue Door. I was advised there are actually quite a few healthy choices on the menu - not to mention that all ingredients are organic, if not local.  Don't skip this place - it really is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"By far my favorite brunch spot. While the atmosphere is slightly lacking In aesthetic it's charming in its own way. Freshly baked goods daily with an ever changing menu always with the freshest ingredients. The plating of the dishes is always so beautiful though you might not expect it here. Truly the gem of the Akron/cuyahoga falls area. I refuse to eat brunch any where else."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped for brunch.  Her croissant sandwich bacon eggs and avocado was perfect taste and texture. I had the best honey bun stuffed with pecans gone and butter to die for.  Light yet decadent.  Baked on premises.My mimosa was great.  Nice staff and manager.  This was wife's second meal and both were fine!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast of my life. My first trip was over a year ago and I still talk about the breakfast I had here. I've never had such thick and awesome bacon. The fresh croissants and homemade jam were absolutely amazing. And I drank more coffee than I thought was possible."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend for breakfast. My advice is to get there early they fill up fast and people will fight over parking spots since parking is limited. The coffee was strong and full of flavour. Our food came fast and our server was great. He knew exactly what to recommend for sides. My breakfast was amazing. I don't think I've had better bacon than Blue Door's. This little restaurant is a hidden gem in North East Ohio. I wouldn't be surprised if Cleveland people drove 45 minutes just to eat here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have been to in my life however the wait time is over an hour. But well worth it! Would come here again if I could beat the line!"}
{"text":"For someone just passing through town looking for a nice breakfast meal, this was an excellent choice. 4 of us came on a Sunday morning just before 11 and the place was packed, although we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. I ordered the chicken pot pie with a side of greens and thought it was absolutely delicious. The pot pie was perfectly flaky and the greens had an amazing dressing on top. Others in my group got the croque madame and standard bacon and eggs, which were also delicious. I didn't get to try any of the pastries or baked goods but would definitely come back for one."}
{"text":"OMG!  I am not a breakfast person, but this place is a must try. My taste buds are craving french toast, crepes, eggs. This place was wonderful, different and fresh!"}
{"text":"I do not say this lightly -- this place is my favorite restaurant of all time. I have been going for years and have never had a disappointing meal. Everything that is available is of the utmost quality and it shows and tastes that way. The Madame croissant is my favorite dish on the regular rotation, but almost always get whatever the French toast special is for the week when I go. I feel as if anything I would say about this wouldn't do it justice so please just go and check this place out."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review using the voice to talk feature on my phone.  Why Blue Door cafe has such high marks is beyond me. I have passed this place on many occasions because they have no sign indicating the name and location of the restaurant. I went in to look at the menu and saw banana fosters french toast. I consider myself somewhat of an aficionado of banana fosters french toast so I decided to give it a try. As I waited for my meal I received a plate of eggs and corn beef hash. I was unsure if this was part of my meal and took one bite of the eggs. After flagging down the host / server at the bar / pastry server to ask if this was my meal she said wait what did you get, to know this is not yours this is he is right next to you. She attempted to take the meal from in front of me and I had to quickly say I already took a bite. She was about to give the meal to the person who ordered it after I took a bite. Even though she took my order a different person brought the meal out. The other lady behind the bar kept repeating over and over again wow you got a lot of food wow that's incredible wow that's funny isn't it haha. It got to the point where I felt like it was a bit rude. When I finally got my correct meal it was two massive pieces of French toast with almost no banana fosters flavoring or flare. The menu should have read French toast with lots of bananas and an odd scoop of vanilla ice cream. gotten. When the male server who gave me the wrong dish figured out what had gone wrong he like the other ladies haha I made a mistake look at all the food you get to K. The place had no decor and probably was not very clean. The lady who was serving me checking people out and taking pastry order is was seen taking off and putting on one rubber glove to shift the pastries around then she would take the rubber glove off put it on the counter behind her run the register pick up the gloves she just rang on the register with and put it back on her hand. In that small 15 minute visit I saw two health violations. It looks like at one point in time if they had two rest rooms one male and one female. It also looks like one of them was handicapped accessible. However now the restroom that looks to have the handicap placard on it has had the placard covered up. The parking lot lines are basically gone. In today's cold and snowy weather there is no salt on the parking lot which has a heavy incline that many of the people who who are older or who cannot walk on ice very well could slip fall and break their neck on. I do not recommend this place. Perhaps this place would be better in a hipster area like Austin Texas or Highland square or even in high end are like Beachwood."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! The coffee, the pastries, the plain bacon and eggs, the seven course Valentine's Day meal.  All excellent!"}
{"text":"Pretty so so for actual breakfast. If you're working on becoming diabetic and want something carb filled this will suit you. Not many meat options on menu so it was difficult to find a filling meal."}
{"text":"This was an interesting place. My wife and I went for breakfast based on reviews. We loved the food.  Very crowded atmosphere- ok for breakfast but may be too crowded for a nice dinner out. I do hope this restaurant succeeds and brings other similar restaurants to the area!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in NE Ohio. Completely unassuming from the outside.   Everything is fresh, delicious and local. The place is a gem and definitely worth a visit.  They have both sweet and savory. I usually get the croque monsuier. There is usually a wait on weekends so get there early and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Decent. Menu seemed confused, boasting about both local and unnecessarily imported ingredients, sometimes in the same description. Nothing was bad, but nothing was really outstanding, either. At my table, we all agreed that the best part of the meal was the house eggnog."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Every time I go. The baked goods are a must have and the delightfully large portions make for several days of pleasure. The menu changes weekly so be prepared to be escorted to new culinary wonders. So love this place."}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding and discovered this place on yelp.  Since we went on a Sunday morning in a large group, we had to wait awhile for the table.  However once we we were seated, the service was prompt and attentive.  I ordered one of the specials, the New England clam bake breakfast.  While it tasted amazing, the portion size was quite small for the amount of money I paid.  It only had a couple of clams and three mussels in it.  The other dishes at the table had much better portions and everyone was pleased with what they ordered.  At the front there was also a bunch of baked goodies for takeout.  While we were waiting, they were offering free samples and they were amazing.  Overall a great place for breakfast and baked goodies."}
{"text":"Great for stopping in and getting a to go pastry and coffee (which are all great!)  Not so good if you want to sit down and eat. My French toast was very soggy and drowned in strawberry syrup. People at my table LOVED the chicken and waffles but it all seemed a little overpriced.   The potatoes are amazing though. I would eat those all day every day."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and coffee. Love how they have transformed since opening. One thing BRING BACK THE POTATO CROQUETTES! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch session today with the family. We ordered: the Monte Cristo (super delicious) - the Harvest pasta (exceptionally fresh) - Oatmeal w/ Almond milk (Mixed to perfection).  I find the rotating, farm to table menu a breathe of fresh air. The owner greeted us and gave a nice background on the restaurant as well as his services as a Marine.  All around a great experience and will stop in next time I'm back from Chicago."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday morning and we were especially pleased with the Service. The coffee was terrific. The food was very good.I had an apricot crepe. The cheese croissant was superior. A nice place to take a friend to breakfast. No waiting in line on this date."}
{"text":"I took my Mom here today for a special birthday brunch, and this place did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in with my two toddlers, we were greeted warmly and taken care of. The parking lot was full but we were quickly seated at the only open table left, next to the kitchen (which has its own advantages--the smells alone were amazing.)  Everything on the menu sounded good, but I ordered the eggs and bacon croissant and my Mom got an egg white croissant. They were both delicious, and the house side salad's vinaigrette was on point. (Next time though I'll probably order the shrimp and grits if they still have it.)  The only downside is I found a tiny hair on my egg. As someone who's worked in the kitchen, I know these things happen, but still--it's unappetizing. Our server promptly apologized and offered to replace my dish, but removed it from my tab when I declined.  The wait time was average, and in the meantime my girls snacked on a ginormous croissant from the bakery case. We also had an Irish Coffee to share, and when I wasn't able to take the rest home (because of alcohol content?), our server kindly insisted I take home a large coffee instead.   Overall, five stars for service, five stars for food, two stars for hygiene, and five stars for experience. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch. Local, small place so usually a wait. We waited about 15 minutes. Well worth it!!  Delicious entrees with a menu that changes often. High class dining experience in a hidden gem. We had all of the specials and all were excellent. Especially loved the bacon. Farm fresh, organic specialty items. Nice looking bakery items in display case.  You will need to be patient for your entrees - they take a bit to put together. Something to consider if you bring hungry kids. Quick, friendly service.  I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"I love Blue Door. Whenever I have loved ones come to visit, I make sure to take them here for breakfast. Everyone I've had the pleasure of introducing Blue Door to has loved it. The food is innovative, fresh, and outstanding, the service is always helpful and efficient, and you can tell that the owner and cooks are so passionate about what they do. If you love quality and aren't opposed to spending a few extra dollars (which it's totally worth it, in my opinion), Blue Door is the perfect place to go!"}
{"text":"Does this place even need another review? We all knows it's beyond delicious and pricy. I am so lucky to live only 3 blocks away. Parking is never an issue for me here. The only thing I have to add is that their coffee is amazing. Literally best coffee I've ever had."}
{"text":"A day trip to Akron is not complete without stopping by cuyahoga falls to eat brunch at blue door bakery and cafe.  This place surely did not disappoint.  The bakery is absolutely mouthwatering. You would want to go with one of each item.  Brunch menu offers a good selection of healthy, farm to table options."}
{"text":"Beverages:  They're limited.  All that sticks in my mind as to options were fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee, iced tea .....no soft drinks. We both got iced tea, it was a mix of peppermint and some standard black tea, the name of which escapes recollection. I LOVED it!  Boldly flavorful without the bitterness that over-steeping engenders! The lady, who is sensitive to anything peppermint, did not. The waiter is apparently the tea mixologist as following my compliment regarding the tea, he brought out the residual leaves of a tea he had made the day before that was extraordinarily fruity and floral in nature. That one smelled extraordinary, and would have been most certainly would have been kinder to the lady's palate.  The food:  She got a potato fritatta with wild shrimp garnish, some kind of special bacon from pigs with pedigrees or some such nonsense, creme fraiche, etc. It was $15. She felt it was ok.  Not awesome, but ok. The taste she gave me was similarly just ok, as there was no shrimp or bacon in the bite, and as a topper it was tepid.  If it's a hot dish, I want it hot, not tepid, so no 5 star experience here.  I got corned beef hash with eggs and house made English muffin. The  hash was good, but having recently made my own with beef that I corned in the vicinity of St. Patrick's day, it wasn't as good as what I made, and the beef itself was dry.   The potato component of the hash had been cooked in oil in the pan , I think separately, then the twain were mixed, and didn't share the beef's dryness. The eggs were fine, but I think the description of the dish promised one more egg than what appeared.  Inasmuch as a side of the hash was $4, and the meal was $10, I kinda thought the money merited that extra egg. The English muffin was quite good and flavorful, but unlike the typical of the genre, lacked all the familiar nooks and crannies, for which Thomas's had made certain we all look. Perhaps that was ok as it was served dry and no butter was provided or offered to fill the nooks, however a house made fruit compote/jam hybrid was provided which was quite good. The service was excellent and effusive and filled with a pride of product that was infectious. We got a handful of pastries to take home.   In my experience the better looking the pastry, the less tasty.   These items have belied that rule to a degree, as they all looked great, and of the two which we have sampled a pecan roll and a cheese croissanty/danish the former was quite good, the latter good.   The latter needed a bit more cream cheese to reward one for scarffing down all that dough. We both stated that we would come back, but we just didn't have the quasi-religiious experience that others have shrared, so we didn't immediately add them to the \"short list.\""}
{"text":"I only had dinner here, not the breakfast which everyone says is fab. The food was well above average for dinner but I did feel a bit like I was in the restaurant of a cooking school. It felt like there was a lot of learning going on--servers were slow refilling water glasses and that's important if you forget to bring wine as we did. Also, it's not a beautiful restaurant--rather, it felt like students were putting on a show and the rest room is probably one of the worst I've ever seen in a good restaurant. It was so bad, it tainted the entire experience and it would have been so easy to fix. A little mood lighting, a paint job, a nice candle. It was ugly and unclean. Sorry Blue Door you need to step up your bathroom game. It matters!!"}
{"text":"Awesome cherry pancakes and a bacon and egg croissant. All of the baked goods are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This delightfully small bakery and cafe serves in my humble opinion the best breakfast that money can buy south of Cleveland. I have never had a bad meal here, all of their ingredients are so fresh it's as if they had plucked their veggies from the yard out back, then again, I've heard they have no freezer so that probably explains it. They seem to emphasize a eastern european twist to some of their meals, probably due to the head chef being of that ancestry leading to some interesting dishes I've never had before. Each meal is presented as if your at a AAA 4 Diamond Restaurant, and has a taste to match. Their croissants are so soft and puffy with the slightest hint of buttery texture they nearly melt in your mouth and leave you craving for more. Their menu rotates every once in a while, a testament to the ingenuity of those who run this joint. You will not be disappointed in this place, it's worth going out of your way for, and will likely be the only establish that I will miss once I'm out of the Akron area!"}
{"text":"When I came across all of the positive reviews about Blue Cafe's delicious pastry I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into one of their famous lemon squares or fresh baked bread, or so I thought. Yet again, I found myself wishing that instead of sitting at their bar eating bland pastry & drinking over priced & disgusting hot chocolate that I was at an actual bar instead.   Their menu, not for the picky eater! My fiance, however, did love their prince's snack and we both enjoyed a loaf of bread at home later. Can't say I was happy about the butter/oil... whatever it was that left puddles of greasy smears all over my table top. But it pairs great with blueberry/vanilla goat cheese!   The atmosphere itself was adorable & would make an awesome house, but it was pricey... again, $5.00 for a really awful hot chocolate! I got some type of wild berry pinwheel puff pastry, definitely not enough  filling & too much butter/grease... all around little to no flavor. But I will say this, they are the first eatery I've visited where they used cardboard doggie bags and I must give them a hats off to being eco- friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I found the corned beef hash, which everyone raves about, starchy and dry. I'm no doubt contributing to the over hype by mentioning it in my review, making it now even more reviewed. The best part was the whole wheat croissant to which I added butter and strawberry preserves. The server was also great- attentive and enthusiastic"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday, waited forever with very little waiting space.  Finally got to our table and ordered. I got french toast and asked for regular syrup instead of blueberry, husband ordered eggs benedict.  My french toast was two medium thick slices,  with cream,  syrup and nuts but nothing else,  for $14!! It tasted ok,  which is the only reason I'm not giving this a single star review.   My husband's eggs were not poached,  but fried and the whites were not even cooked all the way through. I was not impressed with the small portions at exorbitant prices.  I was even more annoyed when I saw they charged me another $1 for a thimblefull of syrup! ! We had high hopes after heading great reviews from coworkers,  but left still hungry and poorer for the effort."}
{"text":"I can't rate this place high enough.  It get a bit busy on weekend mornings, but well worth the wait!  The pastries are amazing, the service is incredible, and the coffee is delicious.  Ham and Cheese croissants are ridiculously amazing.  Everything about this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food.  I've only been for brunch but I've never had a bad meal!  It's a little small inside so if you're going on a weekend make sure to get there early before the line...and before the quiche of the day runs out!"}
{"text":"Get out of bed and RUN to the Blue Door!!! Breakfast food is my jam, and I've not had better than this!! We got the chicken and waffles and the corn beef hash.. both, spectacular! The service is top notch, the place is clean and neat, and the servers actually love their job!!!"}
{"text":"I can't even explain how delicious BD's food is. Sooo fresh, original, tasty! The food is so good I have actually almost teared up. The pastries are phenomenal. Their homemade challah is so buttery and soft! Michael & his staff know how to make amazing food, plus they've been renovating the inside recently so that you can eat wonderful food in a wonderful setting.  I'd give ten stars if I could! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"My breakfast at Blue Door was OK but the food and experience was not worth the price. I came here around 8 AM on a Sunday morning in late September and was seated immediately with only one other table in the restaurant. With no one else around, it gave me a chance to look around and I noticed the dilapidated wall and ceiling (see photos) which was a definite eye sore leaving a negative first impression.  Service was sufficient as I was offered recommendations for my meal and food was delivered in a timely manner. The Blue Door Cafe prides itself in using local and \"healthy\" ingredients which helps explain the inflated and elevated prices but the mark up is borderline offensive. $12 for my microscopic order of corn beef hash which was served with two eggs requested over easy and toast with a $5 glass of fresh squeezed orange juice left me shaking my head when I saw the prices on the menu and raised my expectations for the food.  The corned beef was cooked uneven with a portion being burnt/charred and pretty much inedible. The eggs were cooked over hard versus over easy. I deduced from the uneven cook that the chef most likely took an extended break or simply forgot my order while it was on the grill.  I finished and paid my bill up front (AMEX not accepted) declining the offer to purchase a baked good to take home with me. It's satisfying to know the ingredients are fresh and local, but if you can't execute and don't have an environment conducive to dining, the prices aren't justified. I'm not sure if I'd ever make a return visit."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing breakfast I've ever had. It went to a level I didn't know was possible at breakfast. If you are in the area this is a place you must go. If we lived in this area, we would be frequent customers."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times in the last 6 months and I still can't get over how amazing this place is! I love everything I've had and I tell everyone I know in the area that they absolutely MUST try The Blue Door. Thank you for serving amazing food and having exceptional customer service! I'll see you all soon!"}
{"text":"Not exactly what I thought it was going to be. I expected a tiny bakery/quick in and out coffee shop. This was so much better than I had anticipated, the food was amazing. Our server was very polite and made plenty of recommendations. He answered every question we asked with a smile. Prices on coffee were actually great. Food was very fairly priced. 10/10 will go back."}
{"text":"Fine dining for the cuisine adventurer.  Expect to dine at a leisurely European pace.  One word of advice.  Wait to have your wine de-corked just before the second course."}
{"text":"Everything after my first experience was amazing. Mitch does a phenomenal job in the back and I'm so glad he got that opportunity to do such wonderful things!"}
{"text":"My wife and I attended Valentines evening which was a choice of two preset menus. Susan got the beef and I got a vegan Swiss chard. I think it was either a five or six course meal with each one being better than the first.this is positively the best meal I've ever had in northern Ohio. I have the benefit of  dinning at restaurants all of the world, many 4 and  5 star restaurants. I've had nicer ambience and I've had equal meals, but I've not had a better meal than this. It's so nice to have a wonderful restaurant in northern Ohio that is truly excellent food"}
{"text":"Lovely place, tasty food with great presentation, very good service. Friendly staff. Amassing specials for brunch: homemade lemonade is a \"must have\". Very good bread!  Will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of sweet and savory that changes frequently. We go weekly and have never had a bad meal. Rather each time we go we are surprised and delighted with the cuisine. The staff is so friendly and attentive.  If you're worried about a long wait, grab some pastries to split with your group. Come back and work your way through the bakery. You won't find a better croissant (just check out the owner's Facebook page to see the attention and level of detail that goes into it). If you enjoy a high quality meal with excellent flavor, this is a must go spot.  If you leave Blue Door feeling you had a poor experience, I would encourage you to avoid leaving poor feedback for this local gem and evaluate your level of judgement for excellent cuisine and service expectations."}
{"text":"My new favorite local establishment!  We've been here twice in the past 3 weeks and will not be able to go long before we will need another Blue Door fix!!!  If you are done with boring old bacon-n-egg breakfast/brunch/lunch been-there-ate-that establishments, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE Blue Door!!!  It kicks boring out the backdoor with its trendy, grass fed, free range, organic ingredients menu!  The specials section switches up monthly!  Obviously they have a creative chef as the selections read--and taste--like 5-Star cuisine!!!  Warning!  If you are on the Ketogenic diet, this place is not for you--the carbs are just too delicious not to imbibe!  Kyle, the server, is the best!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is awesome. I've made it a point to try everything on the menu :-) If you stop by, you have to try the corned beef hash. Don't forget the morning glory muffin to go!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the staff are super friendly and attentive. The menu changes every 3 days as well, so it never gets boring."}
{"text":"M- All they say is true it is the most unique meal in town. Pricey yes, slightly over done pastry yes, muddy coffee check the inside needs a overhaul. The door was not the only thing blue here."}
{"text":"Food: The food is delicious. It did take a bit long to come out of the kitchen, but the coffee is good also and makes the wait not seem long. The portion sizes are large. I got the Croissant Monsieur and absolutely loved the kick of the mustard - definitely get it with the egg (+$2) as it makes the sandwich simply amazing. There was a sizeable list of specials which spanned breakfast and lunch options. One of them (the quiche) was already sold out however by 10a Sunday.   Service: Service was great! The waitress we had was so friendly and genuinely seemed like she cared if we had a good breakfast. She was quick on water/coffee refills. Do not that servers don't take your money. You go up to the bakery counter in the front to pay. The till is conveniently located by the bakery country so you will be tempted to by massive pastries on your way out.   Location: Interestingly enough this place doesn't have any sign that I could make out. It's signature blue (read: turquoise) door is visible however from the intersection of the road. It's not a far drive at all from the highway - just a few over a dozen blocks. There is a small patio covered with an arbor. It does have a parking lot view however and at least in the summer people waiting for a table will be milling around outside (yes, you can wait for your table outside - the hostess will come outside to get you).  Environment: The place is small, but not uncomfortably so. Unlike some small restaurants you aren't sat uncomfortably close to strangers. Counter seating is limited but available for single diners, but may be a bit chaotic as it's opposite where the wait staff goes to collect food from the kitchen.    Overall Recommendation: While you likely will have a wait for a table for weekend brunch (already 15 minutes at 10a Sunday), the food is well worth the wait. The service makes for a good rounded out experience. This place had been on my list for awhile but I kept putting off the 35 minute drive from Cleveland. It was well worth that drive too and I am already wondering when I can make an excuse to come out here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. They get all their food locally and organic when possible or in the case of fish and seafoods they are flown in fresh.  The chefs are amazingly in their food prep. Everything is made fresh daily. The owner specializes in French pastries and crepes made fresh daily. They have amazing organic coffee with fresh local cream. The atmosphere and Workers and wonderful and casual. It's a bit more pricey but definitely worth it.  You can just run in and get pastries to go. I Holy recommend trying this place out. The only down side is they don't have much gluten free items. Usually you can get an amazing GF omelette otherwise it's just eggs and bacon kind of stuff for GF.  Just last week I had a seafood GF inlet and WOW it was good."}
{"text":"I stopped into this little Gem to meet with a prospecrive client for lunch, and this place was worth the drive.    I had the mushroom gnoochi which was remarkably taste and cook to perfection eapecially with it being a rainy, cold spring afternoon in NE Ohio.  The staff was great and even thoguh its about 30 mils from my house and office ill be back soon.  Very impressive."}
{"text":"Excellent experiences every time I've gone to eat here. Spectacular service no matter if it is busy or not. Love the variety in the menu and the fact that it changes regularly. I go here quite often and it is my all time fav place for breakfast/early lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Manager was very attentive and friendly. Servers were very polite and courteous, but not annoying. The manager even gave us a $20 gift card for leaving our table a little early. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My mother and I were doing our normal Saturday morning ritual that we do when I am in town and shes off work. We set off on our voyage for Saturday brunch. We headed to Julian's in Goodyear heights but they were no longer accepting patrons. I decided to turn to my fellow yelpers for advice on where to go. 15 minutes later we were pulling up to the blue door cafe. I would have never found this place otherwise. Such a cute quaint little place. I enjoyed my experience from the beginning to end. Everything is organic and delicious. The service was great. My mother cant stop telling people about the cafe. We both ordered the monte cristo crepe and we split a croque dam for later. It was absolutely divine. I cant wait until I am back in town so that I can take my favorite lady back to this spot."}
{"text":"Upon pulling  in the parking lot and walking threw the blue door you do not expect this little hole in the wall place to have such wonderful food!  Me an my friends decided that we wanted something different for breakfast then our usual place.  We are willing to try any place once, but this place you can't just try once.  The plates look like something you would get from a fancy French bistro and the quality was excellent.  I had the French toast which was delicious and my friend had the grilled cheese which by the way looks nothing like grilled cheese but still great. This place is definitely a diamond in the rough.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a great late lunch! Place was packed at 2pm on a Saturday. Portions are super generous, baked goods are extraordinary. We were stuffed but tried a lemon bar anyway and it was delightful! Well worth the drive, don't let the nondescript exterior fool you!"}
{"text":"I went basic! But their eggs Benedict looks amazing along with pastries! Bacon was unreal- I will be going back. Portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Delicious and different. Tried to eat here several times but the lines out the door kept us away. Eclectic menu, with locally grown fare."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  And within walking distance of my house.  The hubster & I enjoy it as our grownup fancy-schmancy breakfast place, but it's fine for kids too.  We have had the following things, all of which receive a thumbs-up from each of us:  -Apple, Brie & turkey crepe -Challah French toast with Nutella -Some sort of omlette with chorizo -Potato croquettes (if your meal doesn't come with one, you can get one for $1.50) -Hot chocolate, which tastes like it is made with real milk & chocolate shavings, not hot water and powdered mix.  The service is fast & friendly, the food is unlike anything else you can get in Northeast Ohio, the bakery case is ALWAYS full of tempting pastries, breads & other forms of carby deliciousness...my one and only complaint is that they are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays, which happen to be my days off.  If you haven't been here, you don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Although it can be a little packed on the weekends, in the nicer weather the outside seating helps.  Service is always fast and attentive.  If you're looking for quality at a good price, check this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food every time! My girlfriend and I come here regularly and it's a wonderful experience. Not another place like this around. Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and very attentive staff to make sure everything is perfect. We had the corned beef hash and croissants and it was delicious!! The pastries and baked goods are seriously delicious!! Definitely stopping again if we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"I'll often wait a few days after eating somewhere before I get to writing the review, but I feel it is my personal responsibility to tell you about Blue Door as quickly as possible.  If you went to another restaurant instead due to not reading the review I should have written, I just couldn't live with the guilt knowing that I was responsible for you missing out on the brunch of a lifetime!   Quaint cozy restaurant, extremely hard working, friendly, knowledgeable staff, hip indie music, and most importantly THE VERY BEST BRUNCH AND FRENCH PASTRIES I'VE EVER HAD!  Sinfully fresh hot chocolate filled flaky croissants and hot crispy scones that taste and feel like they're being teleported to you directly from France.  Me and 3 friends all got different specials, and each was perfectly prepared, gourmet combinations, fresh ingredients, and incredibly delicious.  I'm sure you'll be thrilled with anything that comes out of their kitchen, but all their fresh baked breads completely blew us away.  If you were leaning towards a sandwich anyway, head to Blue Door, start your atkins diet next week instead, and your mouth will thank you!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food! Lots of local ingredients . Bakery items made from scratch. A little pricey, but worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I have breakfast out on Saturdays and have tried to hit the high points in Akron. This little restaurant has the best breakfasts in town, and perhaps is one of the best restaurants in town, period. The home fries are unique, like nothing else you have ever tasted. Last week I had the best blintzes I have ever tasted there, and I have some experience in that field. They were better than my grandma's. Omelets, quiche, bacon, all are outstanding. In addition you can get brioche, challah, and other pastries that are totally addictive, to go. Pricing is one dollar a plate more expensive than average, and it's worth every penny. Service is good, and the manager will give you a lecture on the pastry of your choice, because he knows what he is talking about, and likes to talk about it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. A bit pricey but the food is worth it. I've been here a number of times and never had a bad meal. I usually get quiche but one time had fish and chips. Best fish and chips I've ever had. The quiche is the best around."}
{"text":"Our first visit on a weekday morning was most disappointing. When the host attempted to seat us at a table approximately 16 inches from two other diners, we asked for a different table as to not disrupt their conversation. There were numerous open tables which were not on top of other guests however he elected to then seat us at a table by the door (where it was freezing) and right next to yet another patron. We both ordered \"bacon and eggs\" ($10 each) which were 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon and one thick piece of dry toast.  We also ordered coffee and were offered one coffee refill before our meals came which was plenty as the cups were large. The waitress never checked back with us after delivering our plates.  Butter for the toast would have been nice. Eggs were requested over easy, one was broken and well cooked (hard).  While waiting to pay, the cashier had a rather long chat with the lady in front of us with no regard to our wait. Blue Door was nothing special. We will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Excellent service! Very flavorful fresh organic ingredients- they make their own bread which is delicious"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a delicious brunch! We came on a Sunday morning - although the wait looked long, a table came quickly for our party of two. The building is unassuming, but the food was delicious. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles - so good. I had a crepe with goat cheese inside and sausage and mushrooms on top - perfect and savory. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I heard about this place from a friend.  On our first visit out waiter told us thIs, \"Anything you have will be the best thing you've ever had\".  He was correct!  I ordered a cup of clam chowder and it was, well the best I've ever had.  The same goes for the rest of the food we ordered.   Our waiter was very attentive and made a point of letting us know a little about the place and what kind of ingredients they use, organic, local and no chemicals.  All we talked about on the way home was how we couldn't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very fresh! Sampled a lil of everything when I went with a group of friends, and it was all excellent! Friendly staff as well. I'm happy to support a great small business establishment that is creative, delicious, and utilizes local farms for their meals. This is the \"standard\" that all restaurants should strive to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a concert last Summer and searching for a great breakfast/brunch stop on our way back home to Pittsburgh.  We stumbled upon the Bloor Door Cafe and it turned out to be a real hidden gem!!! We opted to sit outside since it was a beautiful day and we both enjoyed mimosas along with our coffee.  The food was incredible.. I can't say enough about the pistachio croissant.. YUM.  We are heading to Blossom for another concert next month and so we are definitely fitting in a stop at the Blue Door on our way back home!!!"}
