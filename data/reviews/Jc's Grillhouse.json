{"text":"So I came home and was to lazy to cook so I ordered delivery. I didn't want to go for the same old so I looked for somewhere new and came across this place.   Right off the back the menu was eye catching. Great variety for the picky person who can't find something.  Pros: Must try is the Cajun Calamari surprisingly really good. Great crispy texture, nice flavor and good portion. The tzatiki sauce is homemade and really good.   The chicken fingers are not oily or overly battered. Nice flavor and good portion size. Having the rice is a nice option and change than fries.  Omg! The Dutch apple cheesecake is amazing!!! Great flavour, size and not to sweet. You have to try this!!!  Cons: Sesame Salmon was dry and over cooked. The teriyaki sauce couldn't even help it. Steamed veggies were good.  Smoked bbq chicken ceaser salad was over dressed and soggy. As well not much chicken.  It has good points and bad points but over all give it a try they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon a while back for lunch for two but four of us ending up going and splitting the bill.  When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't that busy. We all ordered off the lunch menu because the prices seemed reasonable. My two friends and I all had burgers with cheese and bacon and a side of fries which were amazing. Fresh (not boxed) meat, good quality and grilled to perfection. The bun to burger ratio was right on point and I recall they used brioche buns. My other friend ordered some really spicy chicken wrap. She didn't care for it too much because she said it was drenched in Frank's Red Hot.  The complaints I have are, while the service was very friendly, it was slow. While the meals were reasonably priced, the soft drinks and side gravies were overpriced. Having said that, I would still return as the burgers were awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sure - Denny's is across the street but this place is much better :)  We come here for brunch after church and on Friday evenings after work. It's quickly become our favourite spot!"}
{"text":"For a \"grill house\" they have precious few grilled items. Many standard greasy pub meal items and didn't care for the atmosphere."}
