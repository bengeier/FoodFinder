{"text":"Studio Café is located on the 2nd floor of the Four Seasons hotel in Yorkville.  The huge windows allow lots of light into this space.  There are gigantic contemporary pieces of artwork on every wall and tall display cases filled with unique, colourful glass vases.

The service was flawless from the moment we made eye contact with the hostess.  Our waiter was there whenever we needed anything, but never intrusive.

My mango smoothie was splendid.  It was thick and full of real fruit.  Worth $9?  I'm not sure about that.

The menu weirded me out a little because I was there specifically for brunch and they only seem to offer a prix fixe for brunch ($34).  The à la carte options all seemed to be heavier lunchier options, which I couldn't imagine consuming for the first meal of my day.  Some of these options include a burger, pasta and chicken curry.  (You'll note in another review that I once had fried chicken for breakfast.... that's a different story altogether.)

So I was stuck with the prix fixe if I wanted a lighter option.  I chose the Soup of the Day (corn chowder topped with crab meat) and the Crab and Asparagus Crepes (with Dill-Flavoured Hollandaise and Crisp Greens).  Both were delicious!  Unfortunately, the mango shake and the soup filled me up so I wasn't able to finish my crepes.  I also found the hollandaise very rich and heavy (maybe too rich and heavy).

Service was incredible.  I really enjoyed dining in a sun-filled room and being surrounded by fantastic artwork.  We went around admiring the different pieces after our meal and it was difficult to choose a favourite.  I also ran into a celebrity there!  (Although, I didn't even realize it at the time.)"}
{"text":"I spent the morning at the Occupy Toronto rally at St. James Park watching kids shouting things that they had no knowledge of, and talking to some of their representatives about matters to which they were completely uneducated on.
After a day in this type of mess, I could really use some good ol' Capitalism.  Table for one please.

Studio Cafe is a little piece of Heaven for any middle aged to late aged Woman, or ultra feminine Men.  \"It's the Four Seasons\" that all I have to say.  But for those who don't know what the Four Seasons is all about, Studio Cafe is the epitome of the company image.  The décor is pretty much as if all of the housewives of Toronto came together and masterminded the perfect testosterone free zone, with early 19th century English elegance..the Indian waiters make it authentic......
They have these spring metallic chairs that feel sooo amazing, but causes the kids to go wild which is contradictory to the ambience.   

Their Irish toffee is brewed for drunks, it's very Irish let's just say.  Their cheesecakes are divine!  Things just tasted better here, the décor makes me want to give up all ambition and raise a baby...or a garden.  The service is as it should be for a hotel.  I love hotels because everybody knows my name; Sir.

I recommend you to visit here before the Four Seasons move out of this location.  
My friend Stephanie joined me just before leaving, she had a big frown at how feminine this place was....but she has friends in schools like OCAD..so who cares what she thinks! 


You know, I went to private school with a girl named Ashley whose parents are co-owners of the Four Seasons chain....I still have her number....what would I look like if I were the face of the ultimate house husband?"}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast because where can one go on Christmas day besides a hotel restaurant or a Chinese joint.

Up on the second floor, the decor and windows make for a nice serene setting. Tables are well spaced apart and the hanging art makes for a visually appealing space.

Food was well prepared. More expensive than I would expect. Standard 2 eggs, bacon, toast is $24. Eggs benedict with smoked salmon was expertly constructed with just the right amount of yolk running. The quesdillas were a bit bland and dry. The smoked meat hash was spicy and very Mexican-styled but tasty. The OJ was called fresh squeezed but seemed to lack a bit of authenticity. 

Solid atmosphere and meal but nothing to knock your socks off. Leave it for hotel guests or if your relatives want to stay in cause the weather is frightful."}
{"text":"I had brunch here on Saturday, Feb. 12, 2011.
For $39, the prix fixe was an appetizer, entree, juice and coffee or tea.
Food wise, I enjoyed the french onion soup, but found the top layer of gruyere cheese similar to trying to punch through a layer of play dough.  Underneath the melted cheese was a big piece of bread that was absorbing all the onion soup deliciousness.  Great flavors, but not my favorite cup of french onion soup.  My entree was fantastic - crepes with crab and asparagus.  Totally rich, delicious and fresh.  The side green salad it came with was a bit wilted - I blame the hot hot plate it came on.  Must've killed some of the greens in the process.  They did a fresh squeezed juice of grapefruit or orange.  I asked for half and half and they didn't bat an eye.  Coffee was meh.  Service was a boo F-minus.  The table next to ours also said that our same waiter was not on the ball.  He was a bit rude and unpleasant.  The other service folk were way better and pleasant on the job.  On the way out of the Four Seasons Hotel, we saw a high tea going on at the Lobby Bar - now THAT Is what I want to check out next time!"}
{"text":"Almost everyone said it is a good place for lunch and brunch but I tried the dinner there first.  I love the service, interior decoration and of course most importantly the food....amazing.  

I went there few days ago for my special one's birthday.  The restaurant put a candle on the tiramisu he ordered and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" with chocolate on his dessert plate.  This was really sweet:)

However, just happened to find that most other people in the restaurant were at much older age that night.... :p"}
{"text":"My parents and I decided to go to Studio Café for Winterlicious for lunch.  We made reservations at 12:15 PM and were quickly seated.  The décor was nice letting lots of natural sunlight in.

The service was impeccable.  Our waiter was quick to his feet and food was also served quickly - especially during lunch at business hours.

Food was okay.  I ordered myself the prosciutto & potato terrine as the appetizer.  This was okay, but the toasted baguette seemed a little bit out of place.  My parents both had the curried sweet potato bisque - and highly recommended it.  For the entrée, I had the butternut squash ravioli, baby spinach, ricotta cheese.  The butternut squash was quite sweet, but the ricota cheese was a perfect complement to it.  My parents both had the salmon, and they were quite pleased with it.  Lastly, I had the pumpkin spiced cheesecake.  This was fairly good as well, however, I would have prefered it if the cheesecake was more firm.  

Overall, a pretty good experience at Studio Café.  The food wasn't THE best, but the service definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"Sadly, the Studio Cafe is not long for this world. The Four Seasons is due to close in a few months, and will re-open a few blocks north. The new location will feature restaurants bearing the Daniel Boulud trademark. I should be excited that an international celebrity chef has graced us with his presence. Instead, I'm a bit sad. 

The Studio Cafe is a pretty room; black and white, yet feels rich rather than stark. Glass-topped tables and slingy chairs are cute and best suited to the svelte denizens of Yorkville. If you're up for something a bit more romantic try to grab a 4-top complete with loveseat. 

Service outstrips the city's finest restaurants. The team remembers you from one visit to the next. Water is constantly refilled, fresh bread (possibly now from Woodlot) replenished without asking, and off-menu ordering is encouraged. 

Veteran servers steer you away from the nifty but esoteric menu-bound dessert offerings, and towards the best chocolate cake this side of your mom's house, and a cheesecake that competes with New York's finest. I rarely order dessert out, much less review it first. The Studio Cafe is the exception to this rule. Staff rush to accommodate dietary challenges. A diabetic guest's request for unsweetened whipped cream to go with fresh berries is promptly filled. 

The open kitchen bangs out requests ranging from the highest concept menu item to the humblest room service request. Things run smootlhy here, and the whole operation is a quiet joy to behold. 

Starters all taste great, but some are more filling than others. Seafood-based options are generally pretty, but small, although the crab salad packs a welcome cirtus punch. Caesar salad arrives with whole white anchovy filets. Squeamish diners may ask the kitchen to hold the fishies, but this would be a mistake. 

Daily soups are often vegetable purees. They're fine, but readily achievalbe at home with a big pot and a hand blender. 

French onion soup is the best in the city, the top properly crisped, the crouton moist and the innards a mass of auburn caramelized onions. It's worth the trip on it's own. (Note: even if it's not currently on the menu, try requesting it a few days early). 

Mains range from good to awesome. Fish dishes are fresh with global starchy influences. Salmon is properly just this side of cooked; halibut is firm and briny. 

A lone flatiron or striploin steak is pedestrian even under an ancho chile glaze. Crisp frites aren't quite enough to elevate it, but they sure go well with a dense and juicy hamburger. or alongside battered halibut in fish 'n' form.  

Grilled shrimp on risotto is lightly spiced but leaves you wanting just a bit more. 

Chicken curry, when it's available, offers entry-level heat and some weird-tasting lime pickle on the side; but it's rich and satisfying on a cold winter night. 

Innovative dishes score well, but the kitchen's true strengths are comfort classic, none more so than the liver and onions. I see you making a \"yuck\" face. Stop it. Perfectly grilled liver is firm outside, yielding to creamy smoothness. Mashed potatoes are lump-free goodness and onion rings contribute crunch. Be bad. Get a side of bacon and marvel at the interplay between pig and cow. It's like there's a barnyard jamboree in your mouth and everybody's invited. 

Coffee is great when it's fresh, a bit thin when it sits. Bonus points for excellent unsweetened iced tea, a rare find in this too-sweet town. 

As good as the food is, I urge you to visit for the service before it's too late. They don't make 'em like this any more."}
