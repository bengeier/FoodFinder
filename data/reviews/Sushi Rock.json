{"text":"Looks like this is the LAST TIME we are going here. We sat the bar and waited 20 minutes to be served only to find out that the waitress decided that she would only serve the first half of the bar (which was 3 couples). In fact she knew we were sitting there, saw us and decided to ignore us all together! The sushi chef sadly had to notify staff, who were all standing behind the wall and chatting, that we wanted to be served. It wasn't even tsunami night and the restaurant was fairly empty. Ugh. Just to think we went there often that the sushi chefs recognizes us, only because it is one of the closer sushi restaurants to us. Service of course was horrible. It is usually mediocre at best when we go anyways. Sushi Rock Beachwood needs to work on their customer service skills and management. Sorry to say you guys just lost a couple of regulars who just itch for sushi. (Mostly overpriced anyways)."}
{"text":"Ordered a very large party tray and the food arrived fresh, on time, and delicious. I did notice that there was virtually no wasabi, though (and I love love love wasabi). I called them to complain and, in less than 10 min, more wasabi was delivered with a sweet, \"We're sorry\" note. Will def order from them again. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my mother-in-law's birthday dinner, and had quite a bit of trepidation from reading these reviews on Yelp beforehand.  I wouldn't call myself a sushi aficionado, but I can appreciate a good piece of fresh fish in this format and know when it's done poorly.  Sushi Rock does fish poorly.  I'm a fan of unagi (eel), so I ordered their Crazy roll.  I think even the guy making the roll must've known that their eel wasn't so fresh, because there was just the slightest, most tiny sliver of eel on this roll while the majority of it was rice and cream cheese.  I had seen cream cheese was listed as one of the ingredients in this roll, just didn't think it would make up 75% of it.  My wife enjoyed her tofu avocado roll, but c'mon, that's not sushi!    Our server was actually very nice and accommodating given that we had a party of 6 and a half (my 8 month old nephew had a blast with the chopsticks!).   I haven't tried sushi elsewhere in Cleveland yet, but I can't help but think just about anywhere else would be better than this place.  Pricey and not at all even average sushi here."}
{"text":"Went to the rock last weekend on Sat with kids and wife. My entire family is into food and all my kids eat sushi. 15,14 and 11. The kids all know thier way around a sushi menu.  We had an event at the Q early and had a 5pm reservation which was not a problem since we were the first there.  I could tell the waitress was \"put out\" when she saw the kids and it was reflected in her demeanor. She was not mean or inattentive just kind of stand off ish. We like to talk about the menu and the food and always ask what the staff likes. She wanted none of that chit chat and even failed to mention the special rolls they had until after it became quite apparent that this was probably going to be her biggest tab of the night.   She opened up a bit when I ordered a bottle of wine and three aps.  We had the Tuna Poke, Jalapeno yellowtail and White tuna sashimi.   The poke was great tasting but drowned just a bit too much in the sauce. It is so good there is no need to have that much sauce in the martini glass it was served in.   The jal tuna was supposed to be a signture bt was little more than thinly sliced tuna with thin sliced jals on it. The tuna was fresh and awsome with the nice spice of fresh jals on it but lacked in presentation.   The sashimi was gobbled by my 11 year old but I did pry a piece from him. Kinda small portion but very good fish.   For the meal we had the Geisha and cobra rolls with 1 20 oz ribeye and 8 oz filet.   The rolls were the highlight. The cobra was something new for me and is now my favorite. Plenty of flavor here without lots of over the top seaweed tastes. Not sure what other reviewers ordered but these were very large rolls artfully done with fresh ingredients. The rolls would fill us so that most of the rest of the meal we brought home.    Steaks were just slightly above average and way overpriced. Both could have benefited from seasoning. I blame myself for not sticking to fish in a sushi place DUH.   Had the waitress not judged us and the steaks been a tad better this could have gone to a four star. Oh and the waitress could have gotten a double tip. (she still got taken care of though)."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in TO. Get the dragon rolls as they're pretty good. The Benoit boxes are excellent value for money."}
{"text":"In my two weeks in Champaign, I have been here twice and am dreaming about my third visit. Why?   For their beef udon.   I swear, since I haven't found a good pho place, this is the best alternative ever. On a whim I ordered it, and found myself faced with a monster bowl of delicious broth, silky beef, cabbage, and a mound of cooked-just-right noodles. Toss in some tofu or something, and it'd be yummmy sukiyaki.  My friends (after I left my happy udon haze) informed me that the seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, and chicken teriyaki were pretty good."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but the inside of this place looks like an abandoned factory ! The half booth half table I sat at was all ripped up and the coils in the seat were not even able to support me which made the stay very uncomfortable. It's not even like this area was full. I don't understand why we couldn't have moved down or have those booths/tables condemned."}
{"text":"This place can be a real hit or miss... there's been I've come here for and the sushi has been great! However sometimes it can be really unsatisfactory. My favorites are the tuna roll, shrimp tempura, and spicy crab roll! It's a decent place if your not looking for something too expensive on campus"}
{"text":"Well, came here because it was the closest sushi place to where I was. The reviews listed were mixed, so I decided to give it a try.   First, the hostesses were dressed very unprofessional. More like they were hitting the club than working. I could visibly see one of the hostesses bums. Not only were their clothes wildly inappropriate, but their bra straps were hanging out. If you must dress skanky, have the decency to hide yo' straps and pretend you are at work and are slightly classy. For a place that markets themselves as \"upscale\" they should present themselves as such.  Secondly, we waited for fifteen minutes and got zero service. My boyfriend had to wave someone from the back to take our order. Which I don't usually mind, but there were only two tables. He tells us our server, Alex would be over soon. Alex never came.   And so we wait. Another twenty minutes passed (we only ordered sushi) and we get our rolls. This time another person brought them. He was not Alex. We had to ask for plates/napkins/soy sauce.   A bit later, another person appears. Also not Alex. She was nice, attentive, and what we should've had all along.   After talking to a few more people, we discover Alex left -- whether he quit/peaced out/whatever was unclear. No one really knew. The manager took 30% off which was okay and not necessary. But seriously, C'mon!   The sushi was pretty good. Large sized and decent tasting. Though on the pricier side. This was my first time eating sushi in Cleveland and I must say, Akron does sushi and service much better."}
{"text":"My God!  It's full of Stars...  Right off the bat let's just admit to ourselves that if you love Sushi and live in Ohio, you are in the wrong place or time:  Ohioans who like fresh salt water seafood, are about 400 million years too late...   Having admitted that, there is an upper limit to how good sushi can get in Ohio and the kind of value you can expect.  Sushi Rock hits that upper limit.  In order to get good value, I recommend going on their half price sushi night (a/k/a Tsunami Night).  The drinks are just OK: have some tea.  As noted in other reviews, yes, the place does attract and hire some very beautiful women.  While they are very nice, since none of them are on the menu, I don't believe it should be included in my calculus of the review."}
{"text":"Good place to enjoy some fairly good Sushi....the steak my buddy got came to the table cold so maybe not that great on steaks.  The prices are pretty high, dont go there thinking you will get out cheap....the service was very nice and will say it was VERY slow.  Not due to the server girl but the other supporting staff....all very slow as if they dont know how to deal with large crowds of people.  the place was very trendy (Columbus) and neat-o inside. The cliental that we saw that evening (Saturday) was very hip and very good looking. I told the server is was a \"Yelper\"....the entire table laughed after I said it as well as the server...she nor her mgr knew what that was.  Nonetheless, they gave my entire table 20% off. So it paid to look stupid for a moment....LOL. Over all, I recommend this place as a good date place so long as you like your date cause you're going to be there a while. I also recommend the Yum Yum sushi dish...very tasty!"}
{"text":"WHAT THE HELL, SUSHI ROCK?!  Went here today. And. The. Service completely sucked.  Waited for 20 minutes. No waiter came to our table. NONE. Not even water service.   We just sat, looked at our menus, and chatted. The only reason we came was because Pacific East opened at 3, and we didn't realize that. However, after about killing 20-30 minutes at Sushi Rock, waiting for a freaking waiter to come by, we LEFT.   WE GOT UP AND LEFT. WALKED OUT THE DOOR. The service is awful! I've had better service at Applebee's. Seriously. DO NOT GO HERE. Go to Pacific East instead. Food comes out fast. It's fresh. It's LEGIT SUSHI."}
{"text":"It was ok, a bit of Cleveland meets sushi in the decor and the environment.  The food was nothing to write home about.  But, it's pretty much what I expected being a sushi place in Cleveland.    I'm not really inspired to write more in this review than I already did, but you can check it out on my blog if you want to read more: http://bit.ly/c4f3BC"}
{"text":"I eat sushi regularly and at various sushi bars both in the Akron/Cleveland area and in other cities and states where I have visited, and I know good, fresh sushi when I eat it. Sushi Rock gave me neither. The evening started on a sour note when, despite the fact that we had made reservations, we had to wait quite a long time for a table. When we were finally seated, we were sat at a table that was not set or ready for customers. We waited almost 20 minutes with no silverware, napkins, or drinks and had still not seen a server. I managed to get the attention of the hostess, and she brought glasses of water and silverware to our table. but we waited an additional 10 minutes before our server even came to take our order. We ordered an appetizer, which was quite good, and despite the fact that we were irritated at the long wait, we thought that perhaps the experience was going to be more positive now. We ordered the surf and turf roll which was a happy 28 dollars, and another  less expensive roll, I don't remember which one, but it was in the 18 to 20 dollar range. and we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Another half hour went by before our server returned with our sushi rolls. My friend and I took a piece from the surf and turf roll which was only 5 pieces to begin with. We were very disappointed that for 28 dollars we got 5 pieces of sushi, but we thought if it was fantastic maybe it was worth it. It was not fantastic. In fact, it was some of the worst sushi I have ever put in my mouth. The seaweed part was definitely stale, as was the rice, and the filet mignon, which was supposed to be hot and medium rare, was instead cold , overcooked, and tasted more like grocery- store- deli variety roast beef lunch meat. Rice in the second roll was stale as well and it tasted \"off\" like the fish was starting to go bad. When the server had not returned to check on us after 15 minutes, I again flagged down the hostess and told her that we were unhappy with our rolls. She disappeared in the back and after another 10 minutes our server finally came to the table. I explained to him thar the sushi rolls were both bad, that they tasted stale, that the fish in the one roll tasted very fishy as if it were starting to go bad. His response was simply to express amazement that we would question the quality of the sushi and he tried to assure me that it was all fresh, had just been made, and that we really ought to try it again. I assured him in turn that he was wrong on all counts, and that when he had a dissatisfied customer, the proper response was, \"I'm sorry ma'am, what can I do to make it right?\" not \"You're wrong, try again.\" He finally relented and said he would speak with the manager. He asked if we wanted to wait for another set of rolls or to order something else, and I told him no and asked him to please take the sushi rolls off the bill, we would not be staying. We got flack about that as well. He tried to explain to me that they did not take things off the bill, that their policy was to replace it with something else. I explained to him that we did not I want to eat anything else because our experience thus far had been so poor. He eventually came back with our bill and had had the manager remove the rolls from the bill, but the manager himself never came to the table to speak with us, to apologize for either the bad food or bad service. It was now almost 9:30 in the evening, and we had yet to have dinner. We ended up driving across town to the Peppermint Cafe, which was actually quite good, and I would highly recommend. Although the hostess at Sushi Rock apologized profusely as we left, we have no plans to return. There are many other sushi places in Akron and Cleveland that trump Sushi Rock in every category, except the previously unmentioned loud and annoying music pumping from the bar area that made comfortable conversation an impossibility, and I would recommend almost any of them over this restaurant. Perhaps if you are young, at Sushi Rock to deafen yourself and deaden your tastebuds so they do not NOTICE the poor-quality food, Sushi Rock is fine. But if you are a grown-up who wants a sushi experience with high quality food and a place to have good conversation with your dining mates, try Sakura in Montrose instead. They are superior in every way. Do not waste your time and money at Sushi Rock!"}
{"text":"this place is terrible.  customer service is bad!  sushi is terrible..  i initially asked for take out so they pack everything but then I changed my mind and ate in the restaurant instead.  halfway while im eating the girl came to me and asked is it take out or eat here.  i said i changed my mind and she said we already packed everything for you, use whatever is in the bag not the ones on the table .. she's referring to chopsticks and soy that i used.... and she said .. you wasted what we packed for you.. omg how rude!!! this is the short girl with eyeglasses by the cash.. terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I can't understand why JUSTEATS users are giving higher ratings. So this is my review. I ordered California and the dragon fire. The dragon fire was an innovative dish I never seen before it was quite good and the marinade was tasty, but it's far from what you would expect in a roll, nevertheless it was a tasty, new experience. Now the California roll was at best average, the quality of ingredients can be better including the sashimi. As for the banana ice cream, nothing goes wrong with that on a hot day!! I would check the reviews before ordering again, but I would order from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but a little loud after the sun goes down.  Food is pricey unless you go on Wednesday for 1/2 price sushi."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Rock today with much expectation.  A Japanese sushi restaurant in campus town is long overdue.  Unfortunately, I spent over $50 on below average food and came out very unhappy.  Service was okay, but everything else was more than disappointing.  First, they don't have high chairs.  I went with my family, which includes 2 kids.  I should have just left when we found out that they don't have high chairs.  Their edamame was over cooked, over salted, rice was undercooked, and chicken teriyaki lacked flavored.  Also, I had to ask for every little thing such as folks, spoons, napkins.   Because we went on Sunday for lunch, we had to pay dinner price.  My kids who usually love Japanese restaurants left  Sushi Rock hungry.  I ordered sashimi don (hoe dup bap in Korean), and it was by far the worst I have ever had.  Who puts so much lettuce in a dish that's about balancing different vegies with a great sauce (which was terrible as well).  I wish I could get my money back.  We're never going back there."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Sushi Rock, the first was to the Beachwood location 3+ years ago.  3 stars goes for both visits.  I went on a Wednesday, 1/2 price sushi night, and I *think* that might be for a reason...I can't help wondering if it's about the last day they can get out of the fish on hand.  3 of us ordered 5 of the 1/2 price rolls and one big roll.  They were all just ok.  Maybe I am a sushi snob, but I feel like all the glitz and glam this place puts on is the only reason people think the food is as good as they do.  Granted I do like the atmosphere, which is the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2, it's cool and kind of clubby- very cosmopolitan.  However, I will probably stick to the more divey-looking sushi joints in the future as, in my experience, the quality is almost always better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Tsunami night (1/2 price rolls on Thursday nights at Beachwood location)! Reservations are a must. My friend and I had no wait and our food came timely and just right.  It is nice to see a restaurant/bar in Cleveland packed on a Thursday night!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch one day last week, and we will probably try a lot of other sushi places in Champaign before we come back here.  We had the veggie gyoza, and 2 vegetable sushi rolls.  Yes, this review is based on a vegetarian meal!  The gyoza were deep fried with almost no fililng, and while the cucumber avocado roll was par for the course, the \"Vegi 911\" roll was gross -- filled with a spicy pepper that added no flavor, only heat.  Along with 2 cokes, that racked our bill up to $26."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Get the poke, its probably the best bang for your buck there. The big rolls are actually really big and filling. Service was horrible. The server came around literally every 30 minutes. We ended up bring there for over 3 hours. To his defense, he was nice and they put our server with a bachelorette party as well, so it was more of a management problem. They did end up comping us a round of sake bombs, so they get a star for that."}
{"text":"I started going here because it was convenient, but it grew on me over time. The sushi is always fresh, and the rolls have a reasonable amount (not overflowing!) with rice.   Prices are reasonable, service is good, and the martini's are fantastic (seriously - go try the lychee martini)"}
{"text":"This place is over rated with all so call pseudo sushi lovers.  There sushi is not authenticated Japanese sushi, they are pretty much westernize.  The atmosphere doesn't have the Asian feel either.  If you like to enjoy the bar-like environment and don't know or doesn't care about the sushi taste, it will be ok.  However, if you want real sushi, you should go to Ginza Sushi House next to Progressive Field, where it will give you real Japnese Sushi."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant in Toronto even though I don't live near by  Very good quality and generally fast and friendly wait staff  Reasonable prices  Reliable"}
{"text":"This is a trendy sushi roll place. The atmosphere is fun, the lighting is flattering, the service is friendly and helpful, and the patrons are beautiful. The complaints are ridiculous. I think people just like to complain because it's popular. If you want to have a fun time eating some creative sushi rolls, and drinking some creative drinks, then this is a good place. This place is comparable to trendy sushi places I've enjoyed in LA, Boston, Vegas & NYC. After all, 99% of sushi places in America are serving previously frozen fish. Unless you are willing to pay $600 per person for omakase at a place like Masa in NYC to have your fish flown in daily from Japan, you'll be getting pretty much the same thing everywhere you go. As far as being expensive, it's only a few dollars more per roll than the grocery store charges. I think it's worth a few dollars extra to eat it here, freshly assembled, rather than alone at my kitchen table."}
{"text":"I love this location. I've always had great service except one time. I walked in & sat at the sushi bar. A waitress walked past me numerous times. I allowed her 15 minutes to acknowledge me (since it was a little busy) before I decided to leave. I was so bothered that I mentioned this to a manager on my way out. Not only did he apologize and seat me on the floor, but I got a free appetizer! Great customer service-even on half price Tsunami night! If you don't like sushi, that's a good night to experiment without paying a lot if you don't like it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. On entry you would be greeted with a strong smell of old carpet or bad lamb. Not a very welcoming aroma. That should have been enough of a warning. But the decor was nice.   But we took to our tables and I found the glass of water had specks of vegetables on the side. The soy sauce dish had grime on it. At that point I was being super cautious.   Our server came to us promptly. But our food did not. It took the better part of an hour for the food to get to the table from the time we ordered.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box. I had already made up my mind about not having anything raw at this place. To my surprise I enjoyed it. The salad veggies came from another century because the carrots had already wilted and the greens were soaked in sauce since morning. So I took a bite and dropped the idea of eating the salad. The seeweed pickles were tasty. So was the chicken and the 2 dumplings. There is a miso soup that comes before the box which I liked too.  Now since I liked a bunch of things I added star # 2. Actually it is 2.5. But 3 would be rewarding them for dirt and grime at this point. So will go back if forced."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group, prepaid. Service and food was unremittingly horrendous.  It took something like 55 minutes for them to prepare the salad/soup course.  When it finally arrived the salad was meh and the miso was cold.  The low point of the night came when they brought out the main course.  They apparently served us the wrong order, and only realized it two minutes after they served us (the event was prepaid, so we didn't know what to expect).  So they respond by taking the food back. What were they planning to do, serve it to someone else? (Don't answer.)  Combine all of this with a waitress that perennially failed to remember our orders, sushi surpassed by my campus meal hall, and, of course, higher than reasonable prices, and I will remember this dining experience as one of my worst."}
{"text":"Okay, this is my first time writing a poor review. So bare with me - please note I was a sous chef for a few years I know food; but what really killed me is the service.  Sushi Rock has fairly good food, but, when you order and it finally shows up over an hour and then some later  (6:17-7:30) you start to get annoyed.   More so when you get attitude from some snide woman on the phone after you report this and get charged full price for assumably now not so fresh sushi that's been sitting in someone's warm car. Never mind the health issue point with raw fish after that long a time.  I ordered from this place regularly. Never been treated like that, we're this a better sit down restaurant id like to talk to a manager. Please note this is a Monday night not a weekend.  Disgusted as I really liked this place but cmon when a person argues with you over the phone that it's a far way away (15min by car) you get pretty disgusted.  By the way, there's nothing better a Canadian forces soldier and medic who served 4 years for his country likes than getting a nasty attitude over the phone :)"}
{"text":"Went with a work group. Half the food we ordered was not available (including salad and tuna!). Had one piece of sushi, a role that was falling apart just by looking at it. Ordered steak, which was so-so, not worth $29 though... Don't waste your time and money here"}
{"text":"Subpar sushi, but good serving sizes for the price we paid. Took a while for service to come to us, even after asking several times. Ordered a Coke, and it didn't come until we asked again. But it's sushi, and sushi is good."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Rock many times and have also ordered delivery countless times. So much so, I've gotten to know the owner pretty well and he sometimes personally delivers on nights when the restaurant is busy and the food would be delayed. Now that's service.  The restaurant itself has great atmosphere and is usually lively given its location. There is no trendy decor to mention. Though the servers are not that initiated, they do their job well enough and keep the place running.  I'll admit, I'm not a sushi eater. I know, you must be thinking \"why the hell are you reviewing a Japanese sushi restaurant if you don't eat sushi???\" There are two very good reasons why you should listen to what I have to say:  1. There is more to this restaurant than sushi, and I've experienced it 2. Everyone I eat with here eats sushi, so I can act as a proxy  I know the Spicy Tuna Roll and Dragon Rolls are big hits and done well. The salmon rolls are also well liked. I've had many of the vegetarian rolls, including the Philadelphia roll (cucumber & cream cheese) that isn't advertised on their menu. They are done just right without too much rice or too little filling. They fit perfectly into your mouth and make using chopsticks easy. The roll experience is great overall.  The edamame is usually very fresh and well steamed. I have tried many of the chicken dishes, including another item not on the menu: a delicious chicken katsu dinner. The white meat is fresh and not overcooked and the sauces are tasty.  Overall, I like this place enough to go back again and again. Check it out if you're in the mood for Japanese."}
{"text":"Pacific East on Coventry was closed for our last few days in Cleveland, so we wanted to find a substitute to curb our sushi cravings. Sushi Rock appeared to be a good choice based on some of the reviews, but it was honestly the worst sushi I have ever had. You are better off going to Giant Eagle.  The rice was hard, the tuna's freshness was questionable and left a strange aftertaste. For two rolls, we ended up spending more than at Pacific East, where we can get three consistently fresh and yummy rolls.  Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"I live in the yonge and eglington area and this is my go to sushi spot (I typically take out). I always gravitate towards their specialty rolls instead of the standard maki you can get everywhere. The Dragon On Fire is my favorite specialty roll that i've tried! It's a shrimp tempura and crab roll topped with salmon and red snapper then covered with homemade sauce, wrapped in foil and bbq'd! It's a bit spicy for my low tolerance but I endure it anyways because it's that good. Everything else is pretty typical and I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Cool, chic, retro, whatever you want to call it- this place has an electric vibe. What a fun place!   Seriously, Sushi Rock is right in the middle of one of the hottest areas in downtown Cleveland.  Valet parking makes getting in easy.  Great decor .  Our server/bar tender was fantastic!  Props to Georgina ;) I Was in town from Virginia and spent a couple of hours with a friend (and new friends) at the bar.  The rolls were great, drinks better.   A place you gotta go!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, but I ended up disappointed. The restaurant itself is pretty nice inside, but it was very empty for a Friday night.  My girlfriend and I split six different maki/specialty rolls so that we could have a nice variety. I would describe the sushi as the kind you buy at a gas station or grocery store. It did not have much flavor and was nothing really special."}
{"text":"Consistently good & reasonably priced. Decent delivery time as well. I've eaten here for well over a decade now."}
{"text":"This place has its hit and misses. The calamari and Kani Su apps were delicious, but the sushi seemed standard to what many other sushi restaurants put out. I didn't find anything particularly exceptional about the sushi. The hostess did seem a little snotty like another yelp reviewer mentioned, but our waiter was okay. The hostess did not greet me when I first entered so I stood around awkwardly for a bit at first while she chatted with co-workers."}
{"text":"As far as cleveland goes its great. The only thing I hate  is when they sit me next to the door, it gets very cold with the door opening and closing all night. Also, the 2 hostesses I have had have been rude and disrespectfull, but the food is great"}
{"text":"Decent Sushi although overpriced. The place to go on Thursday if you want to be among a gaggle of suburban Cleveland wanna be hipsters trying really hard to look cool and pretending to be sushi experts."}
{"text":"The latest chapter in my tumultuous love-hate relationship with Sushi Rock continued today.  Went for lunch with a few friends, and as always the food was amazing.  The sushi is so fresh and delicious, I almost wanna go back for round two right this minute.  Sometimes I question if I really need all the food that comes in the Bento Box, but it always proves to be the best decision I make that day.    However, what's makes me contemplate ending things with my fave sushi spot is the lackluster service I seem to receive nearly every time I visit.  The waiter was very snotty and acted as if it was the biggest hardship in the world to have to wait on us.  He treated us with an it's-no-skin-off-my-ass-if-you're-here-or-not attitude.  He wasn't attentive, and it took him approximately 15 minutes to run our credit cards.  And at 2:00, it was pretty empty, so sadly I can't even cut him any slack due to busyness.  So here's the eternal question -- do you keep going back to a place and put up with crappy service because the food is so awesome it's nearly addictive?  Do you say a little prayer before you go and hope that things will be different this time, dream about things having changed?    Eh, you know I'm all talk.  As tough as the choice may be, I'll continue to suck it up and put up with the wait staff because I need their spicy tuna in my life.  It's just too damn good.  But don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"A decent sushi place, their sushi options are better than their hot food options . Their bento boxes are too small and don't come in complete ingredients compared to what one usually gets on a bento box. The Stir fries and mixed vegetables are on the salty and bland tasting side. Sushi is definitely their stronger side :-)"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Servers were not unfriendly but incompetent.   My friend and I went on a quiet late afternoon, there were about less than 10 customers, and 3 servers. We ordered 4 appetizer items for the first round, and we got none of them. I asked when the server gave us the menu list for the second round, and she replied \"you can order again,\" which we did. Still two of the items came really late, and two were still no-show. So we decided to order just one last time, one of the appetizers that we had been trying to order from the very beginning, red curry chicken. After a server took the list away for while, they came back asking us what we ordered , so we told them again(a red curry chicken and two ice cream). After ordering the red curry thing for the 3rd time, finally a server came to inform us that they were out of the curry paste. Not sure that was the kitchen's problem or the servers', but if a customer has ordered the same thing 3 times and the servers never deliver that, the servers should at least notice something must be wrong."}
{"text":"The Good: The wait staff is friendly.   The bad:  -The fish is butchered. It's not high quality and it's just treated very poorly.  -The soy sauce dispensers were stuck to the tables and dirty!  -The rice is so sticky (or this could be the fault of the plates) that we had to pry the rolls and nigiri off of the plates.  -It was expensive. Significantly more expensive than its value. $14.99 for a rainbow roll would be steep if it were a good rainbow roll.   Overall, I would never return here. I've gotten better quality and prices with delivery sushi."}
{"text":"This is the best that Cleveland can do? I know that I am spoiled because I am from Hawaii, but for the ridiculously high prices, the food better be fresh and good.  However, it was neither. And the food servers have the audacity to say that it can take up to an hour to prepare sushi?  Its not cooked, how can it take an hour? I've worked in a sushi restaurant, and one hour for nigiri and sashimi? this is total B.S.  Again, if you know good sushi, skip this place. You will be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Went on a thursday night, sushi was okay, didn't taste as fresh.  That is the reason for the lower rating.  Service was solid though."}
{"text":"In addition to sleek, modern decor, comes an indulgent experience. The filet was tender and delicious, but the item I was most impressed with was the calamari which was spicy, salty, sweet, and juicy.  I wouldn't recommend going here a lot, because of the price, but it's a great place to go for a party or special occasion."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Yonge/Eglinton area and have lived there for most of my 28 years. So I've been going to sushi rock since it opened. In fact, I've been going there from before it was Sushi Rock, when it was Edward's Record World!   Sushi Rock has been awesome since the beginning, and has only gotten more awesomer (although also a bit more expensive). They have great prices - they aren't the cheapest around for sushi, but they are awesome quality, and are a great price for that. The service is great, the value is great and they are amaaazing for veg options. I particularly like the spicy vegetable roll (yum yum!) - but ask for extra hot sauce on the side if you like it extra spicy! The eggplant appetizer is also amazing. And for friends that want a non-veg option, there is tons to choose from. My friend got the salmon bento box and it came with three huuuge pieces of salmon.  I've been when it was super busy (as in EVERY table was full) and the service was still pretty quick. We weren't waiting long at all. And when the eggplant came and we were staring at it in amazement, within 30seconds there was someone there making sure everything was ok (spoiler: we were just staring at it because it was so so good).  Will definitely keep going to this place even though I am no longer in that hood (sniff sniff)."}
{"text":"Luckily the hubby and I got to Sushi Rock before our other friends so we waited at the bar which was serving happy hour.  The Raspberry Saketini was decent, served by a friendly bartender, and at only $5, I was a happy girl.  The rest of the group showed up and we were shown to our table (which as it turns out does not share the happy hour specials they serve at the bar).  Have to say the Sushi Rock Shrimp appetizer was quite tasty--perhaps the highlight of the meal.  The sushi itself seemed overpriced for the quality.  I've certainly had better = less stingy with the fish per roll.  I'm sure I wouldn't mind if it was 1/2 price night, but at full price I expect to feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for.  Plus the service was definitely lacking with empty water glasses aplenty.  Overall it had a feel that the focus is more on the trendiness and less on the gastronomical experience."}
{"text":"For a place with Sushi in it's name, the sushi was disappointing.  Rolls only, no nigiri, no sashimi, no custom orders.  The noodle dishes were OK."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock is one of the first places to offer 1/2 price sushi night. During that night it gets very busy and there is usually a long wait. This place is at the heart of the Warehouse District. Rolls are massive and prices are in the teens during regular nights. This is the place to hangout or meet-up before a night on the town."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock has a wonderful interior design and makes you feel like you are in New York restaurant. The lighting is perfect dim that makes you feel comfortable. The service was friendly and efficient.   The price is high but that is to be expected in a place like this. It is more aimed for the younger crowd, maybe between the age of 20-mid 30s. They have a sushi bar that you can right up to and order what you want or you can get a table and order some appetizer and desert. They also have a full bar that you can to as well.   The food was great. It came out fast and the staff was more then willing to help you understand what you get with each type of sushi. I usually get the California roll, which has cucumber, crab and avocado. But there is a whole list of sushi to try, so you can get a different type numerous times.  I recommend this place to some who wants to try sushi for the first time or someone who is looking for a nice semi-upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"Specialty rolls are pretty good. It's a little pricey though. There's often a long wait, and the basic rolls aren't particularly good. Ambiance is nice however and the interior is very modern and swanky.  I'd recommend coming with friends and splitting a few rolls to try more items."}
{"text":"This sushi place is definitely the WORST sushi place I've ever been to. It was so bad that it made me create Yelp account and write a review about.  Let me explain it to you.   1. Food did NOT come out at once.   I went there with 2 of my buddies. We ordered separate dishes and it all came out with 10min gap between each of them. Unless it's all-you-can-eat, it is obvious that all of the dishes have to be out at the same time. I had my dish and had to wait another 20min to eat. My sushi and sashimi dried out like Mohave desert.    2. Sushi, maki, and rolls tasted like TOILET PAPER!!!!  The sushi rice was NOT marinated at all. And it was so cold and wet that when I put it in my mouth, it tasted like a ball of wet toilet paper. I was surprised how single piece of sushi can terrorize one's tongue and mouth. I had spicy salmon roll but it was more like Al-Qaeda roll.    3. POOR SERVICE   Servers never smile or be friendly to you. They all face like as if someone's constantly farting on their faces. As I mentioned above, they are not aware of proper serving method. Service was so poor that UNICEF decided to help them out.     JUST DO NOT GO THERE.  WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  I'M TELLING YOU."}
{"text":"The sushi is absolutely delicious, the best rolls I've had are the jade roll and the spicy tuna crunch roll. The special rolls are about average price, the regular rolls are of typical price also, maybe $1 or $2 more than other sushi places.  You get what you pay for honestly. Though the hostess was rather rude today. Other than that our waiter was great and so was the beer. (Christmas Ale from Great Lakes in May!)"}
{"text":"We must be on a roll lately because this was another great sushi place with great service! It doesn't look like much from the outside so I never walked in before but we went for a birthday dinner Saturday night.  They've recently renovated and it looks fantastic inside, super comfortable and lots of space and really clean. They were able to accommodate 12 of us comfortably which was great. I also learned they recently added AYCE to their menu. Half of the table did AYCE and they loved it. I ordered the Veggie Bento Box and it was wonderful and wayy too much food which is a good thing to have. My friend ordered the Deluxe Veggie Box and it was even more food, we were super impressed. The service was super friendly she was really great. They kept our drinks full and the food came impressively fast.   All in All YES!"}
{"text":"Always raved about this location, but the last couple of times have been mediocre at best. Plates on our table were dirty, as were the ones we tried to take from the table next to us. Eeeeww. Just what we need is raw fish particles not washed off. Can you say \"food poisoning\" anyone?! It's just a matter of time before the outbreak there. Calamari appetizer, way smaller than before. And the one of the sushi rolls was made incorrectly and instead of owning to it, the waitress tried to lie to us about it. And whatever you do ladies, DO NOT use either women's bathroom. They both stunk like a hole-in-the-ground outhouse at a rest area. Not to mention, the ridiculous music they were blasting. Do not waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I dined there recently. Service was so slow. Our waiter continued to disappear and kept forgetting what we were asking for. He never checked up on us. I overheard the table next to us with the same complaints.   Furthermore , their food quality has definitely declined. Used to be great when they first opened however that's no longer the case. Food did not taste fresh. Not a great selection of sushi. Smaller portions"}
{"text":"I really don't get all of the hype about Sushi Rock.  Yes, it has a fun atmosphere and the sushi is decent, but I don't understand why every in Cleveland goes crazy over it.   The sushi is average, however the Cherry Infused Martini is amazing.  I  never go on half price night because unless you make a reservation, you have to hope that you can get a bar seat.   And if you go on half price night, plan on waiting for your food forever.    It is a little expensive for what you get.  I have been to better places in much larger and expensive cities that were less expensive but MUCH better. Sushi Rock is okay from time to time, but I wouldn't say it is a must have for a Sushi craving."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday for lunch and waited in the front with no acknowledgment from anyone. We were about to leave when a server finally asked us if we needed help. The hostess was nowhere to be found. We ordered and service was fine. Food was okay, nothing special. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We've been dining here and getting take-out from Sushi Rock for years. It was always wonderful. Tonight, however, shows it has run its course. We order our usual maki rolls and were very disappointed. The tempura was soggy, the avocado not fresh, and the worst- BBQ eel was spoiled. This will likely be our last time with Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The past three meals at this restaurant have garnered this one star review. For some reason, management does not have an issue with the staff washing the floors with bleach prior to opening. We arrived 2 hours after the restaurant opened and the smell of bleach/ pinesol was overwhelming. Courteous to my date and eager to use my Groupon, we agreed to try and get past the smell. (need I mention that last year my sister and I were finishing our dinner when staff began to mop the floor around us with the same pungent bleachy solvent?) I can, maybe, overlook this sort of thing in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that has garnered the rep for having awesome food, but on West 6th?) As for the sushi, we were sorely disappointed. One of our 'big' rolls was topped with tuna so old it was stiff and chewy. Lost of trust in a sushi restaurant is a big deal since it is raw food we are consuming after all."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi place in Ohio I'm sure because we've had sushi buffets that are better, but I will give it to them for being the only sushi place in the downtown Cleveland area. The one thing I loved was their deep fried sushi and their lobster rolls which were delicious but the rest of their sushi was average and the service was mediocre. I did appreciate them being attentive that we had our daughter with us and provided us with some feedback and what would be good to feed her.   Parking wasn't too bad with plenty of street parking available. The decor is nice, but it's a small space and almost feels stuffy inside. It's located right next to a club that gets obnoxiously loud which is kind of annoying.  I gave them 3 stars for some of their menu and for their service. I think they really need to up their sushi since they ARE the only sushi place in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I take my clients to this place almost every time I come to town...great atmosphere, great sushi, excellent steaks and the Lobster Bisque is a must have.  The only complaint I have is with the hot little hostesses; they could be less snobbish.  I spend $400+ every time...gimme a smile and wink ladies!  :)"}
{"text":"Gotta say, I LOVE Sushi Rock Beachwood...went to the downtown location for a change of pace and WOW, what a dissappointment! The waiter was horrible, unresponsive, slow and had an attitude.  We usually spend $400+ but this night we just decided to get in and get out...They were out of the wine we requested (for a long time apparently) but never updated the menu and the wait staff had no clue.  Our wise-@ss waiter suggested a $115 bottle for the $43 bottle we requested. Bottom line, we'll continue going back to BEACHWOOD but will not be returning to the Downtown location...sorry guys, get consistent!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? This was one of the first sushi places I tried when I first moved to Toronto about 10 years ago. Wasn't the best, but certainly wasn't the worst either. Went there today after about a year or so because I found myself in the area. Man, what happened? Went way downhill. Took one bite of a beef teriyaki dish and sent it back because the beef was rubbery and bland. No apology from the waitress but instead informed me that I'd have to pay for half price for it since I tasted the dish. No way! They ended up charging me for the miso soup and the three leaves of salad that came with the entree. Sushi was alright but the banter about the beef entree left a bad taste in my mouth about the place. Seems like the new owners have their priorities all wrong........  The place was empty at peak lunch time on the weekend. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a bad experience after buying a Groupon for the Beachwood location. I assume they sold too many coupons with an expiration date too early. What is the point of having this promotion if they don't care if the customers come back? Sushi varied from good to OK to below average, so food is not the reason to try again. Pacific East is much better place (although it may be crowded as well). Here are just some issues and I really hope their management read the reviews;) - We and 6 other people waited a long time until the hostess came, with no attempt to apologize or even say \"Welcome\" - Tables were so close, nice to be able to snoop what other people saying :) - Definitely not a place for a date or to relax - No hot tea - \"we are out of it\" at 6pm, they did bring hot water and lemon. Will bring my own tea bags next time...(not) - Missing paper towels in one restroom, and soap in another. Not very clean. - Sticky spot on the table, definitely old :) - Other small things that I don't remember but left not a good impression. On the better side, waitresses were nice and food arrived in reasonable time. Fish was fresh, maki rolls and appetizers were OK or so-so.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review about my experience here January of 2012. I had not been back there since until my job started ordering from here. Every time we order 1. We ALWAYS have to wait even though our food would be scheduled to be picked up at a certain time and 2.Tthey would always try to charge us different amounts and we would have the same order every time. So, now I am really never returning. But, back to last January.....  There were 15 of us for our friends birthday party. His fiance called and made the reservations and even called earlier that day to make sure they still had us down for 15 people at 9PM. They said everything was scheduled and they would see us later. We waited for about 1 hour and a half for our table and were not seated til @ 10:30. When we got to our table it was only set up for 12 people. We moved the table around and asked other tables for chairs with no help from the staff. We waited for a bit to get our drinks. Some people even went to the bar since it was taking a little while. Our waitress asked us to all fill out a sushi form even if we were not getting sushi and that is how she would take our orders. We all filled out our forms and turned them in. She brought out the appetizers and forgot one couples Edamame. She eventually brought it out. Then she brought out our entrees. Meanwhile, getting refills on our drinks was nearly impossible.  She brought everyone's meals out. I asked about mine. She went into the back to check on it, came out about 5 minutes later and told me \" I forgot to put your ticket in but the kitchen is closed now so you can't get any food. I am sorry\" and walked away. So, I NEVER RECEIVED A MEAL!!! My husband and our friends shared with me. Our friends fiance went to the hostess stand and complained to the manager. She was told a complimentary bottle of Champagne would be brought to the table and we would all be discounted on our tickets. Then, without asking if we wanted deserts or coffee, our waitress brings our checks. We told her about the discount and champagne. She said the manager never told her. She took our tickets back and came back about 20 minutes later. Our ticket and the couple with the late edamame had the discounts. Everyone else's was full price and one of our friends just didn't get a bill!  We never received the Champagne and the manger never came to our table.  Needless to say this was not a pleasant experience and I have seen the same waitress there when I go to pick up food for work. Based on other reviews for this location it does not appear that things have changed either. Do not recommend going to this restaurant. The OK food is not worth the bad service."}
{"text":"Not sure what the reviews are all about, bit I personally didn't think it was all that great or over the top. I eat sushi ( like proper sushi) quite frequently  and found their food disappointing .  Ordered the salmon bento box... Fish was dry.. The rolls were taste less, howevert fresh. The salad was sour... and the price is decent, wouldn't call it cheap!"}
{"text":"Went here for business with about 20 other people.  The waiter handled us surprisingly well.  The sushi was hit and miss.  When they brought it out it smelled way too fishy.  Sushi is fish but it normally doesn't smell like the docks.  So I would smell each piece before biting.  Tasted fine, but couldn't get over the smell of the platter.  Knowing that one or two of the pieces might kill me.  The drinks are fine and I think the bartender did a fine job.  Pretty sure they screwed us on the bill.  Ended up pretty high.  I can normally calculate how much the bill is going to be within probably 10%, but this one ended up almost 50% more than I thought it would be.  No big deal, not my money, but thought I'd mention it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3 and a half stars, I would.   Sushi Rock is one of two or three places on Green Street where you can find sushi; unfortunately, I've never been to the other ones so I can't tell you which one is better. However, the only reason I go to Sushi Rock over Sushi Kame is that the location is more convenient. Sushi Rock's menu has changed for the better since I've been here, but their sushi rolls are, while delicious, rather Americanized and very expensive. Be warned, sushi takeout is not great here; you're better off eating at the restaurant.   Sushi Rock also offers other Japanese fare such as bento boxes, which are very much worth the money in terms of the amount of food you get (they also give you miso soup with it).   The service here is quite good as the waiters are friendly and attentive. I've seen the owner come out and do sake bombs with the customers once in a while too."}
{"text":"Terrible!!  My dish was dirty, it took 20 min. for tea and water, and they got the bill wrong, not once but twice!!  Sushi was average.  I will never go there again!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Rock is, as described eloquently by others, not the best sushi place in the world.  It's more of a pseudo-trendy hangout.  It gets quite crowded, particularly during the Nordstrom semi-annual sale.  What better way to top off a day looking at $255 blouses?    Thursday night, they have the \"Tsunami\" with half price on their standard rolls (e.g. the old standby California Roll is only $3 for 6 pieces)  This is a good place to meet a bunch of friends, have some passable food and a few drinks.  They take reservations on www.opentable.com"}
{"text":"I consider Sushi Rock as my go to place for sushi on campus. Its got nice decor and attentive wait staff. The rolls are expensive, but ordering 3 and splitting it two ways usually fills me. It isn't really a japanese restaurant though, as can be seen by the massive amount of korean items on the menu. That said, I'd recommend this place over Sushi Ichiban, which I consider to be a blight on the local food scene."}
{"text":"Small, dark, crowded, meh.  They're just trying too hard here, and it's just not working.  My friend was in town so we decided to get some sushi.  As we were closer to Sushi Rock than Sushi Avenue, we thought, \"what the hell, we're too lazy to walk back down Green\".  With the space being as small as it is, having a waitress bustling up and down the narrow aisles, hovering over your table waiting to take your order and/or refill your water was just annoying.  And the super dim lighting I guess is their attempt at creating a romantic ambiance?  But the fact you're sitting right on top of the brightly lit kitchen and/or right next to the constantly opening/closing front door makes it aggravating more than anything.  $10 for a spider roll? Gimme a break.  I can get two rolls, and a bowl of miso soup from Sushi Avenue for the same price!  Plus, you don't have to tip at Sushi Avenue.  So what does Sushi Rock have to offer that you can't get just a few blocks down Green at Sushi Avenue?  Mmm... maybe the fact they serve alcohol?  Even then.. meh.  Don't get me wrong, the sushi here isn't bad, but it's nothing special either.  I just prefer the hands-off approach of Sushi Avenue."}
{"text":"Very arrogant. Had to sit either at bar, or by bathrooms as they were saving \"best\" tables for this supposedly huge lunch clientel that never materialized (I was there 2 hours).  Ordered the combo / box. No substitutions.  Why I ask?  I like Salmon and it is cheaper than other stuff in box.  Well guess what?  The Box Combo Special (at $15.00) has all of the stuff that should have been thrown away days ago. I could not chew through the cooked shrimp.  The giant clam was just gross and the tuna, which is a good sushi fish was so dry it could have been used as \"tuna jerkey\".  Dumplings were so overdone and chewy, obviously over micro waved.  Had to order a few pieces of the salmon nigri just to eat something decent and at $3.00 per order it is MORE expensive than the very expensive 4 star Table 45 in the InterContinental (which by the way, is a good place for Sushi).  I summarize this place as arrogant, too expensive, and passing off what is throw away food as a \"box lunch special\".  Stay away.  There are many new Sushi places opening up, so there is now competition in this market and you do have choices.  Go eleswhere"}
{"text":"My first visit after hearing good things and seeing adverts. Unfortunately it didn't live up to anything I had heard.  Visited about 1p on a weekday and, as expected, business was slow with only a few tables seated. I found the interior somewhat dark which may have contributed to our waiter's apparent sleepiness.  The menu had a limited selection - particularly of nigiri/sushi - and focused on rolls heavy with sauces and cream cheese. This is what you call Western Sushi. I can't fault them for this as many sushi restaurants seem to assume the US pallet aren't interested in truly tasting raw fish served simple and fresh. So needless to say I was immediately turned off.  Regardless, we ordered a few rolls and nigiri. At first glance the rolls looked generously sized but by the time you remove the thick rice, cucumber, avocado, etc. there was very little fish. It's no wonder restaurants prefer serving $13-17 rolls over nigiri. And our $90 bill proved it.  So as a comparison to other Western sushi restaurants, Sushi Rock is on par. As a comparison to truly great sushi restaurants with a wide variety of fresh fish, they fail."}
{"text":"There is a reason their Columbus location went out of business and I'm sure this one is to follow soon: the management's attitude is bad, cocky and rude. Patronize businesses who want your business, not businesses who patronize you! Horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Tired of being disappointed. I have been here often for lunch take-out. Sometimes the sushi is very good and tastes fresh. Other times, like today, it is not good at all, and clearly has been reheated. It tastes stale, and for a place that is more expensive than a lot of other places, I expect better. Lack of consistency is a problem, and I would rather spend my money somewhere that values their customers enough not to send them off with reheated old sushi. I honestly feel like I should get my money back for today's meal."}
{"text":"Been there once to check it out (2 months ago?) and probably won't return due to location, quality and service.  LOCATION: Campustown. The only places worth going are Jon's Pipeshop, Rentertainment, Bombay, New Life, Evo (sometimes), and Murphy's (rare, since I live closer to downtown Champaign).  QUALITY: We had a few different types of sushi, and they were all greasy and most, if not all on the menu were fried or fusion-y. Overpriced for mediocre sushi, and I also found hair on my plate (not THAT big a deal if it hadn't happened right after my appalling service experience). Maybe their non-sushi entrees are better but I'm not willing to find out since I've been to other places I like more (Sushi Kame, Yellowfin and Kamakura).  SERVICE: I actually don't like reviewing for service (too subjective and I've worked retail so I know what it's like) but this was too much. We were greeted by our server with \"hey guys\" (not very professional but given the location...), and when he saw the back of my head, switched to \"hey guy and girl\" (trying to be witty?). He didn't apologize when he realized he made a mistake (we're both female). I'll give the place credit that they switched servers (the 2nd one made an excuse that the 1st one suddenly became busy with other tables), but maybe only because they heard me say that I wasn't going to leave a tip.  I did tip 20%--however, I probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location in a couple of years, and don't plan on returning.  The tables are packed together so tightly that you practically sit on top of each other.  The service was very slow and certainly not friendly.  Our table and plates were dirty.  Our waitress took the plate away, but never bothered to wipe the table.  It took forever for our food to come out.  The sushi was ok..nothing great.  The lettuce wraps were bland, tiny, and more carrots than chicken.  Water refills were out of the question.  Everything is overpriced and really not worth the money."}
{"text":"We recently went to Sushi Rock during their weekly half priced sushi night on Thursdays. It was not as busy as we thought it would have been. Please be aware that not all of their sushi is half price!   Service was fair... on this visit, our waitress was okay, but sometimes the waiters and waitresses can be a little arrogant and unenthusiastic.  The hostess staff is even worse. They'd much rather talk to eachother than speak to the customers in front of them. They, like the wait staff, have a bit of a snobby attitude.   The decor is very modern and upscale and the lounge area is very comfortable. In the summer time, they have a very nice patio to sit out on.   The food was pretty good!  I had the Grilled Romaine Salad which was nice, but I think I may try something else next time we go. The rest of our party had sushi, which I don't care for, but they appeared to be enjoying it.  There is ample parking in the parking lot out front, but the lot fills up fast on Thursday nights in the summer. There is a small parking garage behind the restaurant and free valet parking is sometimes offered in front of the entrance to the restaurant.   Overall, Sushi Rock is an okay choice, but there are definitely better dining options in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi is just OK, like good enough to keep you alive until your next meal.  If you're lucky, when you take a fat poop the next day, you'll lose a few pounds, consider it a diet method.  Also, if you go during half-off night, they ask you to leave (read: kick you out) when you want to sit and chat, since there are alot of people waiting for your table."}
{"text":"Wait, did I miss something?   I went on a Wednesday for the cheaper stuff and the sushi was totally fine, but I was under the impression from other reviewers that it was insanely good. It was just fine.    I don't go for the argument that you shouldn't expect too much because we're in the middle of the country. If you can't do something well, why would you have a place on West 6th? Locating there is basically them trying to tell us that they know what's up.   I would go back if others are choosing the place, but I'd recommend the sushi restaurant near Progressive Field instead."}
{"text":"No terribly bad, but not good either. I managed to eat my food but had second thoughts about finishing the eel.   I won't return -- why bother?"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite resturant to get sushi at. It is always made very quickly and accurately. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The resturant is also very clean and I'm very happy to have them so close to my apt."}
{"text":"I like the decor! They also have a lot of selection. The martinis are great. In one order I had about 12 sweet potato rolls. Awesome. Easy to go to a bar after since is right on W 6th."}
{"text":"Please don't go here.  I went with a large group for dinner on Saturday.  I love sushi, and I already knew I wasn't a fan of Sushi Rock, but they managed to lower my opinion even further.  Absolute worst service I can imagine.  We had at least 5 different servers (consecutively, not dividing the group to make it easier).  Never took our drink orders.  Had to ask at least 4 times to get a water refill.  Forgot our appetizer completely, after we had placed/reminded the order with 4 different people.  The rolls are like 3\" in diameter so it's completely impossible to eat them like sushi is meant to be eaten, and they totally fall apart when you pick up a piece.  Everything is swimming in mayo, even when we asked for it on the side.  Disgusting.  The bathrooms were filthy and broken.  On a positive note, they did take some things off our bill to compensate for forgetting them, and they were willing to accomodate our large and noisy group during prime weekend dinner time, which can't be said for all restaurants."}
{"text":"If you like spicy sushi this is the place. My wife usually uses half, or all, of the wasabi they put on a plate at other sushi restaurants. But at Sushi Rock, if you order anything with the word \"spicy\" in it... they're not kidding. Wow! Rolls are big and tasty and the atmosphere is fun and young. Sake bombs at the bar are a good warmup."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the delivery service! Our order ended up being over 40 minutes late, and we received stone cold food (the flavour was all there, the warmth was not). I only live 5 mins away, and even if the driver had other orders it shouldn't have taken so long. Upon arrival, the driver insisted on a tip (which I was not planning on giving because of how late he was), and just got progressively more pushy with the tip. I gave in and offered $1.50 for the tip (our order wasn't expensive), but that apparently wasn't good enough for him. He just said \"No tip\" and went back to his car. The food was tastey, but the delivery service was horrible!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place, though I had no huge expectations after reading all of the reviews. I was satisfied, though not wowed by any means.   The sushi was ok, not the best, but it certainly satisfies a craving if I don't  feel like going to Giant Eagle for basically the same thing. Sushi Rock seems really good at covering their not-so-fresh-tasting fish with wild crazy flavors, tempura and great presentation for the large rolls. I do think the large rolls are their specialty (The Sushi Rock and Dragon something or other are the ones I've had and they're super tasty) and I would definitely go back to get those if I'm in the mood again. I'd also heed other warnings and go for half price night--the sushi isn't worth the price, but it might be worth half the price and fighting a bit of a crowd. If I want some plain sushi and a fresher flavor, I'll go somewhere else for sure.   As far as the physical restaurant goes, I was a little weirded out by the atmosphere. Our server didn't seem like she wanted to help out too much, but she did keep my water glass full, which was nice, since I was unusually parched that day. There was something a little weird about the rest of the restaurant. I thought it looked nice and really cool in there, but maybe the fact that there weren't many others there at 3:30 on a weekday was what made it strange."}
{"text":"Was here a week ago. Have been coming here a few time a year since it opened. I have had my socks knocked off here but like a lot of busy places maybe the freshness/ care drops down just a little to good rather than knocking your socks off. Cute waitresses... And cute clientele. Good food. I THINK the nigiri has gotten smaller but still good."}
{"text":"Good location for s a sushi restaurant, everything on the menu is good in it own right and it's a great choice for happy hour. Is their better sushi in this city? Yes. Does it get really crowded sometimes? Yes. Will you meet some really interesting people here? Yes. I have never been disappointed or wowed here? No. I go here mainly for the scenery and to grab some small plates while drinking and hanging out on the patio. I would recommend this place to someone who has never been. Five stars for happy hour and three stars for top sushi restaurants in the Cleveland area, equals a generous four star review."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and even though they stuck is in the back room by ourselves, it was probably better that way. My friends got all sorts of things on the menu, and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. I got a spicy tuna roll and a larger roll topped with crab and a spicy sauce, and it was delicious. The prices were fair for a large roll, but I thought that the more \"generic\" rolls like spicy tuna and California were severely tiny.   That seems to be the case though sometimes at nicer sushi places. I don't quite understand it though. I get that $5 for a roll isn't going to get you much, but I would think that it could get you more than 6 of the smallest, finger-sized pieces.   But I digress. Sushi Rock was still a better than your average sushi place, with a wide variety of rolls that my friends were able to share and sample together.   I almost forgot, we shared a bottle of cold sake for around $18-19. I'm not that into cold sake, but my friends wanted it so I went along with it. It was one of the better ones that I've had, although for me if you're doing sake, get it hot!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi connoisseur by any means. But I do love a plate of salmon.  Sashimi, nigiri, or maki, that's usually what I order.  Occasionally I'll get tuna.  I've tried a few other varieties, but I just stick with my favorite.  And I know that what they serve is farmed, not wild caught, but I haven't seen a place that has wild salmon in Ohio.  They have an excellent \"beef sushi\" appetizer, which is good enough to be a light entree if you ask me.  I'm a bit surprised by how many poor reviews they get on this site, because I think the quality of the food is pretty good, and it's a more upscale place than a lot of places that serve sushi.  I hear you can't get amazing sushi in the midwest like you can find on the coasts, so maybe I'm not the best judge, but for the region I haven't found a place I like better.  Sushi Rock is a better value when it's their half off night.  Unfortunately it's always packed on half off night, because everyone knows that's when you go.  So you get reservations, it's packed, noisy, the service is slow.  But you can eat a LOT of sushi for a pretty reasonable bill.    I really preferred the downtown location, mainly for the convenience of where it's located relative to me.  But it's closed for some reason, and I'm not sure when/if it will re-open again.  I've eaten at the Richmond Road location a few times, as well, and they're pretty comparable.  At the downtown location, I had been stopping there pretty regularly, and rather than mess with reservation I'd sit at the bar and order a la carte.  The same server was covering this area and got to know me, and because I tipped especially well, after that I got extra nice treatment from her.  If you think the service isn't good there, maybe try tipping better, or going when they're not slammed.  If you cant afford that, sorry but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Horrible... Sushi was overpriced and had no flavor. A sushi restaurant that only has about 1/4 of their menu sushi the rest are grilled steaks, etc. Tried the surf and turf roll, steak and lobster tail(very very tiny piece), had no taste and came with a horrible sweet sauce  Wouldn't waste your time if you want sushi"}
{"text":"Seriously... I don't know why I keep doing this! It's my constant search to keep finding average priced good Sushi places and I have to say this place is very average is price but unfortunately also in taste.  I tried their All-You-Can-Eat for $24 which happens all week. I was keep to try a few different things and it would have cost about the same. I had a White Tuna Nigiri, 2 pieces of their Four Seasons Roll (with Salmon Tartare, it was the only nice tasting thing in terms of flavour), Green Dragon Roll, Volcano Roll (so disappointing... nothing volcanic about it) and 1 bite sized Fried Banana (good thing this can't be messed up)  The rice tasted weird and a bit old. Also the shrimp tempura in my sushi was cold and my food came way to fast. I get that when it's super busy and they are just rolling things out but it was quite slow and my food came out in 2 minutes (serious!)  The service however was good and these good servers deserve to serve better food...."}
{"text":"So, our friends came here to eat. so we met up with them here later,  we didnt realize they were closed even tho the main door was closed. thats because we dont really know the area and the previous restaurant we went to had a side entrance. so we went through the side entrance (door was closed shut but  it was open. we assumed thats how you get in) also, there was a good number of people inside still eating. when we met up with our friends, the lady was just plain rude to us. she was snobby and also told us they were close. she pointed out that the entrances were closed, and said they had no room for us to sit and we could not order. Luckily we had just met up with our friends there, and not to eat. We were still kinda like what the because she had said we they had no room for us to sit. which was not true, as there was room for us next to our friends. Seriously. And so we decided to go back to cocomero."}
{"text":"My favorite part about Sushi Rock is Tsunami Wednesday Nights and all the people who fill the bar. Ladies, a lot of them men seem to employed (they seem to be wearing suits). If you are looking for a bargain, Wednesday nights are definitely the night to stop by."}
{"text":"This place is fading fast. I used to come here fairly often but I will never be back. The food is awful. The rolls were some of the worst I have ever had (and they pre-make all rolls in the morning so it's not freshly made). now and it looks like the place is falling apart."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. Seriously.  I know - logically - it's not as amazing as I make it out to be. The decor isn't the nicest, they play really random music sometimes, it's usually packed, the servers tend to be on the over-attentive side, most of the servers don't speak English (or seem not to?) ...    But I love sushi (especially healthy vegetarian sushi) and the Buddha rolls can be made with brown rice and are stuffed with more veggies than rice. Needless to say, they are one of my favourite things to eat. Like, ever. I could go on... and on... but I won't bore you. Prices are also very reasonable, especially the vegetarian bento boxes.  Just go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have dinner at sushi rock in downtown Cleveland after a day of shopping, because we all love Sushi. when we arrived we were told it would be a 10 min wait, but it was more like 30! finally we were sat at a table and it was dirty (how diff could it be to clean a table) so we place our order I placed and order for 6 slices of salmon, placed over the rice. well the salmon where huge chunks or fish (we cut them with chop sticks, it was to think to eat) this fish is to be cut very think almost see thru, and on my third piece of fish there was a fish bone and I nearly choked! the waiter was never around we saw him twice during our dinner so I advised the hostess of my fish bone and she just stared at me with a blank look on her face and didn't even answer an apology. this place is nothing more than a name, there food is awful! please stay away."}
{"text":"Si bien los platos no son excesivamente malos, por $25 espero mucho más de un All You Can Eat.  Hay All You Can Eat mucho mejores en la ciudad.   Una y no más."}
{"text":"If you go to a restaurant primarily for nice decor and a trendy atmosphere, then by all means, head for Sushi Rock.  Personally, I go to a restaurant primarily to EAT, so the food has to come first.  At Sushi Rock, the sushi only comes first in their name.  It's a stretch to even call it mediocre.  If you've ever had even halfway decent sushi, you'll be disappointed.  Neither the fish nor the rice were fresh, and the rolls were inexpertly prepared and falling apart.  The sake selection was just sad.    It wouldn't be a bad place to go for drinks, but it would only get me craving GOOD sushi and I would leave disappointed again, so I'm not going to bother.  Next time I'm craving Japanese food, I'll head for Pacific East in Coventry."}
{"text":"Their sushi is good, however limited in selection. I really enjoy the dragon roll and that's about it. I have had their lunch boxes and they are ok, not particular better than Sarku Japan's and yet they are pricier.  The atmosphere in this place is modern and hip and therefore the booths are rigid and painful to sit in. The chairs I believe are also without padding.  Overall I would give it 3 1/2 but I can't take half of a star off."}
{"text":"I had a really good time when I went here for a late lunch. It was on whatever the cheap sushi day is, so we were able to get many different rolls for not too expensive. I like that there is Japanese beer available because I'm not really one for liquor or sake. We sat at one of the two-person tables, and I felt really cramped. It was pretty much like we were at the same table as the people on either side of us, which was kinda awkward (but at least they were friendly!) Our waitress made recommendations to us based on her tastes. I always like to hear recommendations when I eat out, so it was nice to get an answer other than \"everything's good.\"  I'll be back fo sho."}
{"text":"The price was a little pricey. The sushi combo that i get was excellent which had tempura roll in it. Beside that, the shrimp fried rice was a thing too. Overall, i did enjoy it."}
{"text":"Had an urgent craving for maki and it was the nearest sushi restaurant. Ordered spicy scallop and kamikaze rolls. Was disappointed in every way: taste, presentation, and service. Very dry and bland rice. Salty and lukewarm miso soup. Not so fresh ingredients. Would I go back? No."}
{"text":"Finally got to experience sushi at Sushi Rock.  A few friends have mentioned how good their sushi is.  Their spicy tuna rolls are generous in size and spicy--just how I like them.  No crazy stuff in them to act like filler (i.e. avocado).  Just straight up lots of yummy spicy tuna and the rolls are super fresh.  Good stuff.  Get them extra spicy and they'll come with a thick layer of sricha sauce on them."}
{"text":"Prices were good.  Quality was mediocre. Service was very mixed.   Hamachi sashimi -  large chunks.  Large semi-frozen chunks!!  There was also some kind of chewy white stringy part of the hamachi that we had to spit out. Could not eat it.   Server took the item off our bill (we didn't request it), which was an appreciated gesture. Would have just liked our hamachi to not be served frozen though.   Green dragon roll - alright   Volcano roll - ok  not spicy at all though.   Spicy scallop - scallop itself was standard.  Not spicy at all though. I found myself adding a lot of wasabi to the soy sauce.   Buddha roll - ordered a vegetarian roll which I normally don't do, but this is a really tasty roll!    Service - the waitress was ok. The reimbursement of the awful hamachi and her prompt action was good customer service. However, some other things were not very good. We saw our platters of sushi sitting and waiting for it to be served to us, even though we weren't eating anything. this happened more than once.   We were really looking forward to trying this restaurant out, and unfortunately it was a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine a time when I'm not in the mood to get my sushi on, but this night I just wasn't (could have been those 3lbs of Melt's cheese sandwiches I threw down at lunch, you say? Stop judging.). I opted for some edamame and a small cucumber/avocado roll, but I witnessed 11 of my other friends destroy ornately designed roll after roll, \"Mmm\"-ing with every bite.   Our service was a little slow - we waited nearly 10 minutes after our rolls were brought out for soy sauce. They probably should have had one more person helping him, especially when the food came out, but overall it was good food and a fun time.    They take reservations and can accommodate large groups!"}
{"text":"The location is good, but the food is far from authentic Japanese food. The teriyaki sauce seems fake. Better choices for Japanese food in town would be Yellowfin or Kamakura. I thought the prices were too high for what you got. College kids might enjoy the large portions of food however."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the Yonge-Eglinton area and decided that I had better get a move on trying out all of the Japanese restaurants here. :D Sushi Rock is the latest place I've visited and I can't say that I was overly impressed at all. It's not that the food was horrible or anything, it's more like the entire experience left me feeling really bland.  First of all, all of the food my boyfriend and I ordered wasn't bad. It was edible but if that's all I can say about the food, that's not a very praise-worthy complement. I ordered the pan-fried gyoza, vegetable tempura, ebi nigiri and the equivalent to a dynamite roll. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki entree and gave me the miso soup that came with it.  The pan-fried gyoza was made with chicken. They had a vegetarian option available but it wasn't labeled as being pan-fried. They were decent but something about them just fell kind of flat for me; I've eaten far better in other places. I think I might be picky though, since my boyfriend seemed to enjoy them enough. The ebi nigiri was alright but it didn't taste like it was really fresh. It was kind of warm but it still managed to taste alright.  The dynamite roll was listed as being a shrimp tempura roll, from what I remember, but also came with avacado and cucumber. It was poorly put together. The rice was flattened as thin as possible and patches of nori showed through on the outside. It also seemed kind of loosely held together. It tasted okay, but I wasn't really impressed.  The chicken teriyaki had both white and dark meat options. My boyfriend had ordered the white meat and found that it still had a lot of gristle. It came slathered in a copious amount of teriyaki sauce. I stole a piece from him to try for myself and it did taste okay but as he says, if it had less gristle, it would have been infinitely better. The miso soup was pretty average, no real complaints there.  The service was really good, for the most part. The waitresses were all friendly and quick to come back to refill our glasses with water. It wasn't until the end of our meal that I started to feel somewhat unimpressed. The waitresses all cleared our table and continued to give us refills on water but no one had asked us if we wanted to order anything else and we had to wait a while before we could even get a chance to ask for our bill. Also, the vegetable tempura was never brought out to us. (Fortunately, we didn't get charged for it.)  The interior of the restaurant is nice but I felt like I had absolutely no privacy as the tables were all spaced fairly close together. It was really loud and I felt like the crowd was a little pretentious for my tastes. I suppose the type of crowd that frequents the place can't really be held against the restaurant itself but I left the place feeling pretty \"meh\" overall."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and trendy. The Sushi is good, not the best but enjoyable. The atmosphere is excellent and the service is great.  I strongly suggest going on a Thursday night when they have half off their sushi and maki rolls:-)"}
{"text":"Blah.  That's how to best describe the sushi at Sushi Rock.  Why go here when you can get actual good sushi at Pacific East or Wasabi just around the corner?  Just because the name says Sushi Rock doesn't mean that you rock because you eat here."}
{"text":"I thought the food was awesome.  One little problem I did have was that the cooks burned our food so we had to wait another I guess 20-30 minutes for our food to arrive.  Even though the wait was a little long, it was definitely worth the wait.  Their sushi is very tasty and me and my guest ordered more to take home."}
{"text":"I've had better.  Yup, that pretty much sums up my experience here.  If I was to use one word - disorganized.  Here's why.    First, reservations were made for a Saturday night.  My date and I arrived on time.  The hostess was polite, but showed little concern for our seating arrangement.  I would have chose a different table and almost did.    Second, we waited at least 10 minutes before a waiter even came to our table.  Really?!  Apparently, he didn't know he was our waiter.  We placed a drink order and it took another 10 minutes before that arrived.  The waiter appeared to be very busy with little time for us.  The night continued in that fashion.  The amount of time we had to endure for our sushi to arrive was unacceptable.  When the food finally was placed in front of us the waiter took zero time to explain the dish and quickly exited the area.  We are not sushi experts by any means.    Third, allegedly their checkout machines had \"gone down\".  Our bill was wrong.  I had to point this out to our waiter and had it corrected.  Overall, the atmosphere is great and I enjoyed the food.  Unfortunately, we spent 2 hours at this place for 4 rolls and a couple beers.  The wait staff seems to be lacking in training and there is no sense of urgency."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off! I was excited to see that there was an option of brown rice for an extra fee. I ordered a bento box plus an extra set of sushi all to be made with brown rice. They forgot to pack the rice that came with the bento box. I called the restaurant and explained that the forgot the rice. The first person I spoke to all could say was \"oh oh oh\" and handed me off to another person. I explained that it's too much trouble to go all the way back to pick up the rice and kindly asked for a refund. The person I was passed onto, I'm guessing it was the manager told me to call Just Eat to ask for a refund of the brown rice. I didn't get why I needed to go out of my way for a mistake they made. I paid for extra for the rice and never got it. The person wasn't willing to find a solution and the simplest one being just refund me for the rice. The people at this restaurant have absolutely no people skills. It's also slightly more expensive than other Japanese restaurants in the area because it's on the busier street. This isn't the first time they forgot to pack an item. Earlier this year we ordered from this restaurant and they forgot to pack a miso soup. Anyway, it's unfortunate because their food is pretty good and they have the option to make it's slightly healther; however, it's absolutely not worth the headache. This restaurant is only after the quantity of customers, not quality."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. The service is by far the worse. Our waiter was rude, he didn't want to suggest anything and his careless attitude like we were wasting his time made me chuckle. When we spoke to the manager he was just as much as an ass as the waiter. Won't be going back there ever!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Everything is so flavorful! You may hesitate to trust a place that boasts a section of fried sushi, but believe me when I say that you MUST try it.  It's amazing.  The Crazy Roll is the bomb.  IF you are more of a traditional sushi lover, then their \"plain ole\" sushi will do you fine.  One highlight of the sushi their is that they come in nice big pieces.  They also drizzle some flavorful sauce on there (well at least the kind we got, maybe not all of them).  Just a little drizzle, not too much.   ALSO if you are not a sushi lover, or even if you are, you must try the steak.  Super good.  The beef sushi is also to die for.  It'll satisfy Mr. Meat and Potatoes.  Also notable are the lobster risotto and truffle mac and cheese.   I think I could eat here everyday! The only downfall is that it can get pricey (especially since everything is so good and you'll want to try a little of it all).  I think I\"ll have to try the half price night."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock is one of those trendy places you end up eating at multiple times.  It's like the first place that pops into the minds of people who have never had sushi but think it would be fun to try.  Thankfully I now know enough of other sushi places in the area that I can steer these people in another direction.  Every time I eat here I get sick to my stomach within a few hours.  As in, rushing home and cancelling plans or driving really fast on the way back because I need my home bathroom NOW.  I wouldn't be so graphic if it weren't for the fact that this has also happened to friends of mine, and that I know from extensive adventurous eating sushi consumption that this is NOT at all normal nor some sort of intolerance I have for sushi.  Heck, I'm the queen of rare steaks, ordering tuna spine marrow up at the bar (at another sushi place), and \"it's probably fine if you just microwave it\" and I refuse to eat here ever again.  I don't know what the problem is--poor fish quality, issues in the kitchen, etc.--but maybe it's not an issue all the time, which is why some people seem to like it.  Or they have stronger stomachs than mine.  But it's happened enough times it's no longer just coincidence."}
{"text":"The reason why I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because my dad loved the chop salad, and was satisfied with the grilled chicken breast and garlic mashed potatoes. BUT the sushi? Well based on my experience, probably 1/2 a star. I ordered salmon, white tuna and yellowtail sushi, the Alaska roll with fish roe and a yellowtail roll. The first thing I noticed when my platter was served was the lump of bright pink pickled ginger on the plate. Bad sign. Really, really bad. Crap ginger prepared with FD & C #40.  Okaaay. I asked our server about this, and he explained that the restaurant ran out of their regular ginger, and this was their back up. Okaaay. The fish on the sushi was fine, not great. My peeve was the rice was rolled into little balls,and the fish didn't stick to the rice, making it difficult to eat. It just wasn't professional. The Alaska roll was mediocre at best.  The yellowtail roll was vile. Yellowtail tuna is my favorite. This tasted disgusting. It had tiny pieces of red in the middle of the roll, so I opened it to see what was inside. What I found was the bloodline of the fish! The sushi chef gave me the f***ing bloodline. Didn't a contestant on Top Chef get the boot for failing to cut out the bloodline? Well, complained to the manager (who looked 25 years old tops), and he acknowledged I was given the crap part of the fish (in so many words), and that they have loads of yellowtail (so why was I served a bloodline roll?), and I was given a fresh roll (mediocre). I also mentioned the ginger, and the manager lied, said the chef orders a special pink ginger. What? Is this the same chef who filled a yellowtail roll with the bloodline? No way does that color exist in nature.  I have been to some of the best Japanese restaurants in the country, and have never seen \"pink\" ginger. Also, from where I was sitting, the guys behind the sushi bar appeared to be Caucasian. I seriously doubt they went thru the intense training required of a real sushi chef. If you want good, authentically prepared sush go to Pacific East."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock just opened yesterday, and I wanted to love it.  It's just...for now, okay.  The servers are friendly and are trying really hard, but my tempura udon was only okay.  The soup was a bit lukewarm and the tempura was a little uneven.  In all fairness, they're trying and they're working out some of the kinks in the system, I'm sure, but I was a little underwhelmed.  Still, I feel this is a bit more of a Midwestern attempt at what sushi is *supposed* to be like....  I might give you another try, but you were entirely medium in my book, Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"I never expected such good sushi out of Cleveland.  But anytime I'm in town this place is a must stop.  Some of the best in the country."}
{"text":"Stranded in Cleveland, Ohio you may find yourself attracted to the city's view of Lake Erie, the architecturally unique Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and some historical streets that give the city its Midwest character. Little did I know, this city also is home to some of the best sushi I've ever had. Sushi Rock, located in the heart of the warehouse district of Cleveland's west side, this modern sushi establishment is truly an oasis for any nomad or local to enjoy a superb sushi meal hundreds of miles from an ocean. Having grown up in San Diego, CA, the Pacific Ocean has provided me with plenty of raw fish served to me by an intoxicated Japanese gentleman. In addition having ventured to Kauai and New York City, I've had my share of great and not so great sushi; but Sushi Rock was a definite surprise. Having gone about a year hearing how great this place was and denying that no place in Ohio has as quality sushi as \"back home\" I was skeptical to go. The instant I walked in, I was under a sushi spell. With two stories and an incredibly high ceiling, a Warhol-esque picture of a Manhattan skyscraper was the cherry on top of some interior designer's masterpiece. In my group of four we were directed to our table, which consisted of two small tables put together and a bench that stretched across the entire left wall of the dining room. After being served our waters and described the appetizers the waiter recommended, I made an executive decision to order the calamari, which is a personal favorite of mine. When the calamari arrived I knew right away that Sushi Rock knew what they were doing. Anyone who's been around me long enough to know how sensitive my pallet is knows that I take calamari very seriously and when taking my first bite into their calamari, I was introduced to a flavor of this squid that I had never had before. Served in a risen, wooden bowl, upon a large white plate with sauce garnished along the rim, the calamari was definitely a great first item to use my chopsticks on. With a honey-like glaze, the calamari was a perfect appetizer and definitely left room in my stomach for the much-awaited sushi. After enjoying the calamari I decided to pick up the menu and see if they offered similar sushi that I was accustomed to.  The menu offers a variety of rolls whether you've had sushi all your life or it's prom night and it's your first time. Sushi Rock's menu has one section that stood out to me: the Sushi Rock Big Rolls, which consist of a generous eight full pieces. One roll that I've ordered every time I've gone and a favorite of my usual group is the Crazy Roll. Crazy consists of unagi, avocado, masaga, with a little cream cheese, all deep-fried. Having grown up with avocados being handed to me by the avocado tree in my back yard, I very much fancy the unprecedented taste of avocado. With that said, I am not a fan of cream cheese, but with the powerful taste of the unagi and masaga, the Crazy Roll is nothing shy of perfect. Sushi Rock offers a vast array of sushi and I've tried so many it's hard to identify them but the only roll I haven't agreed with was the Spider Roll, which contains soft shell crab, crabstick, cucumber, and broccoli, with a spicy mayo sauce. The only issue we had with that was the texture the broccoli provided; but if one takes the broccoli out, the roll isn't half bad.  One part of a meal I almost never have time for is dessert, especially after eating a decent amount of sushi. What's awesome about Sushi Rock is because they want to provide their patrons with a live-fast city style atmosphere and not just a sushi bar, is they have an array of desserts whether it be the traditional Japanese Ice Cream or even a crème brûlée, which I decided to order. After putting my spoon through the top of this perfectly designed masterpiece of a dessert, I couldn't leave the restaurant without finishing the entire item.  Sushi Rock is not only a great place for sushi but also it's a great place for a guaranteed amazing time whether you're with friends or with a business client. I never knew that the city that brought us Rock and Roll and a politically incorrect baseball team could dish out some of the best sushi I've ever had. Call me crazy but if you ever find yourself in Cleveland, Ohio, do what I did: order the Crazy Roll and don't be surprised when your palate sends you a \"Thank You\" card."}
{"text":"The trendiest and tastiest sushi in Cleveland.  We used to go on Wednesday nights when sushi is half off.  Be sure to make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, good atmosphere.  The sushi is pretty good in quality; however, it's the not best I've ever had. The sushi rolls and sashimi rolls are excellent.  It has a creative menu selection of sushi and it's relatively good.   I see many young professionals and hipsters down here.  I also see many people I know here.  Don't miss the classic California roll, Rainbow roll, Rock & Roll, Pretty Women, and Tempura Roll.  The tuna tetaki appetizer and seaweed salad is pretty good, definitely a Must!  The service is slow and the entree menu is mediocre.  Definitely go to Tsunami Wednesday (Downtown) or Tsunami Thursday (Beachwood) for the best deal.  Expect to spend roughly 15-20.00 per person on Tsunami nights or 35-40.00 per person on regular nights and weekends."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock is boring. That's my short version - cliff notes if you will.   The sushi is fine. The atmosphere is fine. The drinks are overpriced and the service is, well, its fine. To me Sushi Rock is like the Applebee's of sushi joints - chain restaurant with a standard watered down menu that appeals to the masses. Yes, they have cheap sushi on Wednesday, but do you really want to eat \"discount fish\"? I don't. If you've ever researched \"fish specials\" at restaurants, you'd know that it goes on sale right before they have to toss it in the garbage. Still impressed? The best item I've had at Sushi Rock is the calamari and it is FRIED. That says a lot to me about a sushi restaurant.   Have I been to Sushi Rock more than once, yes. Do I look forward to going there, no. Its downtown, which is convenient and its sushi, so people think they are being exotic by picking it. I'm never going to fight anyone on the suggestion (especially if they are paying - its not cheap), but I won't ever make the suggestion myself."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. My work colleague had his food come out literally 20 minutes after everyone else had already finished their meal. To top it off, most of the dishes were mediocre at best, especially the sushi, which had generous portions but was not good enough to justify the price.  The filet mignon was good however."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times on business; as a visitor to Cleveland, I honestly wasn't expecting much in terms of sushi.  Sushi Rock was a pleasant surprise.  The fish was fresh enough and the sake menu was halfway decent.  There are plenty of \"fun\" rolls to choose from if you're not into sashimi.  It's fairly expensive, and definitely doesn't have much competition in terms of cuisine.  My last visit to Sushi Rock was about a month ago, and you know what that means.  Uh-huh.  Copper river salmon time.  It was very well prepared, and though it might not be fair to rate this restaurant on the basis of an inherently delicious food, this is the reason I'm giving Sushi Rock 4 instead of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly service but the sashimi used are not as fresh and many entries are not as delicate as some of the similar Japanese restaurant in town."}
{"text":"The boy and I came here on a Thursday night, and were at once taken aback by the crowds of singles mulling about the bar and the lounge.  \"So this is where all the singles hang out in Cleveland,\" was his comment.  We were told that it would be a forty-five minute wait for a regular table, which I had expected.  We made our way through the masses to the sushi bar, where there were plenty of open seats.    The half price special was on nigiri and basic sushi rolls.  We had salmon nigiri; tuna, spicy tuna, tempera shrimp, and alaska rolls.  It was prettily presented on a black wooden plate.  Everything seemed fairly fresh with no excessively fishy odor.  The one qualm I had was that the salmon was slightly warm to the touch instead of being cold.  I also saw tempera rolls wrapped in paper being brought out from the kitchen instead of being made at the bar in front of us.  But for the price, I can't complain.  Our total came to just under twenty dollars.  PS - I was horrified to see the woman next to us soaking her poor sushi roll in soy sauce, turning it several times to mop up the salty liquid, before eating it."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the services was good. They accommodated a group of 20 in the back room with virtually no notice and as far as i could tell no one's order was messed up and was pretty quick up. The drink was also good and not unreasonably priced (since most sitdown restaurants gouge you for any alcoholic beverage that is above well-liquor quality. Had the Gold Rush and it was also tasty.  I'm in town for work from Oregon and this place is WAAAAY overpriced given the quality. Definitely decent sushi, but the roll (8 pieces) i ordered was 13 dollars. At the joint i go to weekly back home i would have gotten comparable quality and taste and it would have cost $3.50 (conveyer belt style place and that particular roll has 4 pieces per plate at 1.75 per plate).   I knew i should have yelped it prior to going but alas thats also the downfall of being with a large group. It wouldnt be so unreasonable on a half-price night that I've been seeing in these reviews, I should have checked before I came!. I won't be back here likely this trip unless we go next thursday for this halfprice thing. Ill check out other places in the area when in town to get my fix. Not bad food or service, but way overpriced, i would NEVER go somewhere that charged that amount back home."}
{"text":"I order from Sushi Rock a lot and I am very happy with their service and their food. FYI they have gluten free soy sauce and they are very accommodating with my gluten allergy. Definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I went to this place with 2 Sushi Ichiban loyals. The first few things that really catch your attention are the slick decor (which makes Ichiban look like a hospital waiting room) and the bar located in the center of the restaurant stoked with Japanese beers and sodas (Ramune!!!). This place blows Ichiban out of the water in terms of service, sushi selection and aesthetics. The only drawback, in my mind, is that they serve tea in bags as oppose to a more traditional loose leaf variety.  Bottom line: if you want sushi, come here. If you want a ton of chicken teriyaki for cheap and don't care about the crap service/experience at Ichiban, go there."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock pretty much ROCKS! It's one of the few Japanese restaurants I know that doesn't over stuff their rolls with rice. Yes, I'M FOR REAL - they actually have more of the good stuff in their maki. This indeed is a rare gem.  We had a \"nice roll\".  And I'm not lying. That's the actual name of the roll. And it was pretty \"nice\".   The volcano roll was supposedly spicy which wasn't that spicy. Yet overall, it was good, but didn't rock my world like a volcano would.  The plus here is the fish. The fish in all our rolls and sushi was probably one of the freshest I've had in Toronto. Also, the staff was attentive and friendly. My green tea never saw empty and not once did I have to ask for a refill.  However, no matter how enticing and interesting a lychee margarita sounds, DON'T GET IT! You'll make a sour face each time you sip it. Not because it's sour. Actually, it's not sour at all. It's a pretty odd concoction of tangy sweet, scrunch your face as you drink kind-of-drink. If you know what I mean. (Which you probably won't until you try the drink!)"}
{"text":"Would give them 5 stars 3 year ago. The place has gotten a lot worse. Thursdays used to be great value with 50% off. Now - 1 hour wait and tasteless sushi are just not worth it. Service got a lot worse also. Big disappointment. It used to be a cool place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cleveland for work since 3 years and most of the time, my coworkers and I are in the mood for sushi dinner at least once a week.  The overall quality of the seafood is fair but, however, the service and atmosphere is next to horrible.  The wait staff is completely ignorant and do not know anything about the menu options and one of them I had dealt with in the past did not know what mochi was....and this is a sushi restaurant?  One of my friends ordered some alcohol infused coffee drink and it basically sucked.  So he called the waiter and told him the drink does not taste good and the waiter says 'it is a hit or miss'....who says that?  And my cappuccino was watered down...so the waiter (another one) says 'the machine is broken'...so why the hell did you get me a cappuccino?  (i did not tell him this but...lack of common sense that the wait staff has)  The waiters also have no common sense and lack charisma and etiquette that is required, especially for a venue that considers itself 'chic' and 'trendy' and 'sophisticated'.  The price is not an option for me when I go out to eat, but if you need to fulfill your sushi needs, i suggest you go to Ginza in Cleveland.  Sometimes, you rather go to a not so big place to fulfill your big palate...or small.  Unfortunately, I work with people who prefer the 'cool expensive look' over the 'quality' of the meal itself.  So as a group, my company coworkers come here after a long day at training....but honestly, once you come here...you will know why you would not want to come back.  Besides, you rather eat fish that smells not so fishy....unless you are a very hungry cat.  If you are E&Y...avoid this place....because Quality is everything we do/eat."}
{"text":"I went here Wednesday night for half price sushi.   Average to below average sushi.  I'm not sure if it was the quality of the fish maybe, but overall it just didn't blow me away.  Service was also average to below average.   The music was pretty loud, club style.  This was a club environment with a dj spinning music.  Overall, would probably not go back here if there is a better sushi alternative downtown, especially if paying full price."}
{"text":"My 2 friends and I came here on a lazy Sunday after shopping. We saw their lunch deal and decided to grab some sushi before heading home. What a mistake.   The place had some people sitting but wasn't anywhere near full at lunchtime around 2pm. We come in, get seated, get the normal tea served, that's all fine and well. Give our orders (2 sushi combos, and a chicken teriyaki combo), so, you'd think that'd be pretty simple. Then a couple gets seated beside us about 10 minutes later.  10 minutes after that, the couple beside us start getting their food coming out. Actual full-on rolls, combination platters, whatever. We've munched our salad and soup and are looking at them sadly, expectantly, thinking (in vain), that our food was coming out soon since we had sat down before the couple.  No dice. The couple keeps eating, we keep chatting.  For 40 minutes. No food. We asked them around the half hour mark if they were planning on giving us our food. \"Oh, sorry, they are making it right now.\" THIS IS RAW FISH. Everyone else had CLEARED OUT. HOW IS THIS OKAY.   Then, when we got the food, our combos were missing fish on them (my friend and I had ordered the same thing, her plate looked twice as full as mine), and a part of my friend's teriyaki combo (the california rolls) didn't even COME until we reminded them that it came with it. The tempura dipping sauce tasted watered down, the chicken teriyaki was cool as well.   There was literally only the couple in the restaurant, it was 40 minutes after we ordered, and they STILL couldn't get our orders right.   On top of all that, there was no apology, no attempt to make it up to us, nothing. The couple beside us had their tea refilled maybe 2/3 times, we had ours refilled near the end of our lunch.  Needless to say, we will not be going back here ever again. Horrendous service, and didn't even really pay attention to the food because we were so pissed and hungry and disappointed that it was ruined regardless.  Horrible experience, we should have completely refused to pay."}
{"text":"2 down.  ? to go.  So I hit Sushi Rock yesterday from a friend from a rival company across the street.  This was a much better experience than Pacific East.  Sushi Rock is a trendy, upscale place built for people with money to spend, but not necessarily a huge eye for tradition.  I'll start with the easy stuff-  Decor is that pseudo asian decor that uses water stones and funny lights.  It's attractive ... but not particularly japanese.  The bar is very well stocked with a good variety of options in terms of alcohol and liquors.  Music is pop-ish, not particularly intrusive.  Talking to one of the chefs, fish shipments come in Monday and Friday.  You do the math.    Beer selection was a little bit of a surprise, beyond the standard American and European brews, as well as the standard 3 Japanese beers, Harbin (Chinese, northern) and Morimoto Obi (Oregon brewed, Soba based) were also on the menu.  That was a big plus for me.  No Yebisu, or Sapporo reserve.  Sake selection was poor.  Nothing into the daiginjyo category.  A couple plum wines.  No toro of any grade was available.  The chef noted that he only recommended the sake and maguro.  I ordered Chirashi, and two orders of nigiri sake and maguro.  The fish was rather fresh.  Slicing technique for the nigiri was a bit blockish for me (sliced into a very even, and slightly thin, rectangle.)  The inclusion of some of the tendonous elements was also notable.  Rice was unintrusively seasoned.  It fit well with the fish and was solid in taste and consistency.  I've had better seasoned rice, but this wasn't bad.  The Chirashi was brimming from the bowl and the rice bed was seasoned with sea salt, tobiko and nori.    Despite the chef's claims otherwise, the fish was reasonably fresh.  A decent selection of fish was atop the rice bed, ranging from tuna, salmon to octopus and egg.  This place isn't too bad... the pricing is a tad high, but at first glance, there's not too much competition in Cleveland.  I'm looking forward to trying SasaMatsu (claims to be Izakaya!) and Matsu.  If any of you know of any Japanese run places here, please drop me a line.  Heck...does anyone know any Japanese in Cleveland?!  For locale comparison:   Against venues at larger metropolitan centers: I'd give it a 3, largely because given relative cost of living, this place is relatively expensive for CLE."}
{"text":"I think Sushi Rock's 15 minutes of fame has long passed. I used to frequent this location for Tsunami (half price) night as well as other regular nights and have found the level of service, food quality and general atmosphere to be significantly less today than what it used to be.  Granted, my most recent visit was on Tsunami night simply because it was the only evening I had off that week but nonetheless sub par. It began with the reservation, which despite having one; we sat around for almost 30 minutes waiting for our table. The hostesses seem to be quite aloof to exactly what their job is, they  seem to have a difficult time seating people. There is no quicker way to annoy a group of hungry people than by seating a party that walked in behind you AND which you overheard saying they had reservations for the same number of people.   On to the food and service...The quality of the rolls have diminished in my opinion, although my favorite it still the Kani Su which I typically order 2 of because I love it that much. The service was spotty and again it was 1/2 price night so I get that they are completely swapped the entire night but a smile and sincere apology for forgetting something goes a long way. The only real draw for me is the swanky and fun atmosphere anymore.   So sayonara Sushi Rock, it's been real but I probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"Really bad steak, which is a shame because the bone-in ribeye is supposed to be their signature steak.  First time in my adult life I did not eat the entire steak I ordered, it just was not that good.  The sushi was OK, but I am still waiting for my table to be cleared.  Is that too much to ask?  Clear the dirty dishes before bringing the check?  Methinks I'll not eat here again soon."}
{"text":"Staff is snooty, quality is poor. I have sent things back for smelling old or fishy. NOT what you want from a sushi restaurant. Let me mention the staff again...  Apparently, at the Beachwood location, they only hire spray tanned Oompa Loompas. These girls all have skin the color of Doritos. Most have tramp stamps clearly visible above their yoga pants. Seriously?? Yoga pants?? They act as though they are doing you a favor showing customers to a table, or taking an order. I used to like this place for lunch, but will not bother anymore. I even have a restaurant.com certificate I will never use because of the poor experiences I've had the past half dozen visits."}
{"text":"You can taste fish scales while you having sushi. Even we noticed to waitress, she didn't say anything back."}
{"text":"Came here because of Thursday half off sushi night and because I had a gift card. I had a great time with friends, though the sushi was very average.   Sushi Rock caters to a trendy, mainstream crowd and I think the environment is more central to the Sushi Rock experience than the actual sushi. The sushi trend is a nice afterthought.  Of the sushi, the salmon nigiri was pretty good and fresh. The mackerel nigiri had a strange taste to it though I was still able to get the essence of the fish. We also ordered some very standard rolls like spicy tuna, hamachi (yellowtail), tuna, and Alaska. All were very average.  I have to say that the crowd was very pleasing and the decor set a nice mood. Half off sushi and a gift card makes for a nice, cheap meal!  I guess if you want good sushi... go to the coasts."}
{"text":"I've noticed that a lot of people are disappointed with SR so I should note that I ordered take out and did not dine in so my review is based on that (very good) experience. In short, I think Sushi Rock is great for those that love sushi that has a lot of raw fish in or on the roll.   I was very impressed by how great Sushi Rock's sushi was. I ordered a rainbow roll and 2 other rolls that were similar (rolls with assorted raw fish on top) and I was shocked at how great the rolls were. They were fresh, a little creamy inside--simply incredible. I feel like the prices here are slightly lower than Kofusion and they also have a wider selection of sushi rolls. Again, as someone who loves the rainbow type rolls, Sushi Rock offers a lot of that variety at prices around $10-$13. They also have a very decently priced sashimi platter at just $10-11. That is CHEAP for any sushi place and I absolutely would have ordered this if I hadn't already had my eye on 3 other rolls.   I'm not sure what their dine in service is like, but at least when I was getting take out, the hostess was great, offering me some tea, and when I declined ginger but mentioned I love wasabi, she made sure to give me extra wasabi at no additional cost.   Also, some reviewers have questioned the restaurant for serving Korean food and not being authentic Japanese food. In short, sushi is not strictly Japanese fare and Sushi Rock is not trying to be a Japanese restaurant. *A lot* of sushi places are owned by Koreans and they really are a unique niche. One of my favorite dishes, hwe dup bap, is only served in Korean-owned sushi restaurants because it is specifically a Korean-sushi dish. So, don't expect authentic Japanese food here and don't be surprised by the Korean entrees. This is all part of the culture and cuisine of the place itself. CU has a lot of restaurants that are like this (in fact, I believe Sushi Kame is the ONLY Japanese-owned sushi place in town) so for those wondering, this is why you'll see a mix of ethnic cuisines."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I've ordered sushi, udon, and takoyaki from here. It's a bit pricey, but not very remarkable. This is one of those trendy Asian food places that pop up here and there, but they might be pushed out of business with places like Sakanaya or Sushi Kame. Sushi Rock has a nice, clean environment with hip decorations and a kpop/jpop mix going on in the background.  The sushi is alright, but nothing really special. It's better than Sushi Ichiban no doubt, but compared to other sushi joints, the price isn't worth it. The udon is nice and the broth is warming, so I would recommend that. Mine came with vegetable and shrimp tempura, which were delicious! My only complaint with dining in is that the service, while friendly, can be a bit forgetful and you have to remind them you need water or your bill so they know you're there.  The takoyaki was awful and a total ripoff though. I was picking up a snack between classes and paid a little over $4 for four lukewarm, shriveled up ping pong balls covered in sauce and a little bit of green onion. They were soggy and the little octopus bit was chewy like a wad of gum and tasted bland. I'm pretty sure they're the frozen kind you buy at Asian markets and you can buy a large bag to microwave at home for a better price.  Of course, it's conveniently located on Green Street so it's close to campus and convenient for hungry students who would rather forego the even more overpriced and poor quality of Sushi San in the Union basement."}
{"text":"All the sushi we ordered tasted great. According to my Japanese friend with me, he said that the quality of the sushi was pretty good. The service was decent and the servers were as friendly as they had to be. Overall great experience for a guy who does not have sushi too often."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant and I'm regular comustomer. Every time I go there I gave the tip over the %15 but i won't give them a tip anymore. I knew that the servers can't get the tip. Their wage is just $12-$14/hour including a tip. It was shocked. You don't need to give the tip for servers."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews are funny. I've never been to half-off night (nor would I ever, that's asking to be disappointed anywhere you go), I never order rolls, and I ate between lunch and dinner so it was not busy - take my review based on those facts.  I sat at the sushi bar and ordered through the sushi chef. I asked him to make me a chirashi and he obliged. This wasn't on the menu, but any sushi chef in he world knows what it is and how to make it. It was exceptional. The fish was fresh, not vacuum-sealed frozen garbage like some other places in Ohio (I'm looking at you Otani!), and the arrangement was gorgeous. It included albacore, yellowtail, standard maguro tuna, salmon, and octopus over a bed of sushi rice garnished with flying fish roe. The chef also included a cup of albacore in a sauce of jalapeño, vinegar and ginger (how tuna tataki is commonly served except without the sear). Nice spread.   The only thing I can suggest is that additional sashimi be added to he menu. The lack of scallop, mackerel, snapper and giant clam for example is a shortcoming. However, I overlooked this because the meal I had was top-notch.   I will be going again. You should too. Ask for a chirashi and thank me later."}
{"text":"I understand that if reservations are not made it can take a while to be seated. However, the hostesses were rude and just told everyone to sit at the overly crowded sushi bar. The patio was pretty much empty and so were several sections. The music was too loud and to top it all off the staff acted like I was interrupting by visiting. I walked out with my friend and the staff could careless. I wish I could review the food but I couldn't even get into the place (keep in mind it's was a Thursday night).  Horrible!! Better off going to Fresh Market and getting sushi."}
{"text":"Hard to find free parking in downtown Cleveland but the walk was worth it. Fast friendly service and sushi and rolls were great. Atmosphere was nice too."}
{"text":"I would give this place between 3 and 4 stars, however the waiter was so kind to us that it gets 4!  In short, pretty big place. We went out on a Tuesday so it was not crowded at all. We received a clean and not sticky menu (i've read the reviews below...) and the waiter came and checked up with us on a regular basis. We had a glass of wine, some edamame and three sushi rolls.   Wine; big and good, Edamame; nicely served with sea-salt,  Sushi; yum! Delicious and big! So after three rolls (which we did not even finish) we were stuffed!"}
{"text":"I've always had a fantastic experience when coming here, and it's hard for me to believe this place would have bad reviews! I love sushi, it's definitely in my top 5 favorite meals of all time and from sushi loving experience, I can tell you that Sushi Rock knows how to make some damn good sushi. Their rolls are delicious, miso soup is out of this world, and I could eat endless amounts of their edamame.   My Dad and I ordered grey goose martini's straight up, and they accidentally brought us dirty martinis. I believe it was the manager on duty that night that personally got us new martinis within 5 minutes of us requesting new ones. Such good service!  I recommend the rainbow roll, spider roll and sushi rock roll. They also have a ton of delicious fruity drinks and fun cocktails. I also recommend making a reservation as this place books up fast (even on a Thursday), otherwise you can eat at the sushi bar which is also a good time!"}
{"text":"This place is really good for what it is: cheap sushi.  Mixed plates range from 12-18 bucks, come with the standard miso soup and edamame.  The fish was surprisingly fresh, really good for the price.  Just keep in mind that that is what it is, nothing fancy, or extraordinary.  Its good for your basic maki rolls, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, etc."}
{"text":"we went here on a saturday afternoon around 5pm and the place was deserted....  people started to come in around after 6pm.  the menu looks good from the vegetarian stand point of view. there are 4 veg dinner sets and lots of veg sushi and appetizers.   the waitresses didn't seem to know what's on the menu and couldn't answer our questions of what are we ordering... after few trips back and forth to the kitchen we finally thought we know what are we ordering but the dish that came in was still different from what was described. still good food.  they also have a great selection of alcohol drinks.  and in general the atmosphere is very cozy."}
{"text":"Sushi rock is so yummy! They have a diverse menu with soups, noodles, meats, and of course sushi. They have an affordable lunch special with two rolls and your choice of salad, miso soup or udon soup. I love everything I have here. It is definitely a place to check out on  Green street ."}
{"text":"A solid sushi place with a hip, modern atmosphere. The maki had a decent (but not extensive) variety, but they had some good favorites that my friend and I always look for: futo maki and inari! :)  I wouldn't mind heading back here if I were visiting, but it's far from my overall top 10."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the volcano roll or the dragon roll but avoid 1/2 off night unless you want to wait forever and only get the cheap items."}
{"text":"Sorry sushi-rock. Had to drop a star off for an extremely inattentive front desk / foyer area. A friend and I stopped in Wednesday evening to try to grab a drink and late dinner. I must've stood in the foyer for 5 straight minutes staring at a waitress who looked at me multiple times from across the restaurant. You would think that if you saw a concerned customer standing in the foyer you would ask if they needed help. Obviously not the case here.   Went to the bar. Still no help. Tried to wave down another waitress, still no help. Finally was able to stop someone and ask about a table only to be told sorry the kitchen has closed but you can grab a drink from the bar and sit at a table.   No. Thanks. Peace. Train your employees to pay attention to what's going on in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we went here. Probably because it was half price night. Oh yeah, yes... that's pretty much the only reason.   They didn't even have maguro. Seriously? They conveniently \"ran out\".   Oh, and also -- their bartenders don't know their product. At all. My cousin was trying to order 2 beers. The conversation went something like this: cuz: \"do you have that Japanese stout? I can't remember the name but I know it's made by Rogue.\" bartender boy: \"you want a SNOUT?\" cuz:  \" ........... no. I said STOUT. really?!\"   Snout. Yes. That really happened. How does a bartender not know what a stout is? Bizarre.   Bleh."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good food, good experience.   We were seated quickly, and service was fast. Our waitress was polite and suggested a shared plate special (skytower?) that was awesome!  Our food was prepared quickly, served quickly, and the atmosphere was enjoyable. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and maybe I'm a little bit of a snob about it living in California for 11 years. But I just can't get down with this place after trying it a couple times.  The sushi is cut very thickly and has a very bland taste. Which I guess is better than a fishy taste, but it's just not good on the palate. Maybe it's the distance the fish has to travel. But I've been to a couple other sushi places in Ohio and they were a lot better.  It's probably in part the sushi chef's knife skills. It seems like it's trying hard to be cool. It misses the mark for me."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service good price. I and my family been here one a month. For 2 years  clean. Quiet. Cozy   But not too much food if you like quiet  and cozy  this place good for you. Come to try"}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure why Sushi Rock receives so many bad ratings in regard to the taste of food.  I've patronized both the Downtown and Beachwood locations dozens of times since 2009.  Only once has the sushi been less than delicious (it was very dry and tasteless.)  I'd say that's a pretty good track record.  I've dined at sushi restaurants all over Northeast Ohio, and had sushi prepared by first class sushi chefs.  Sushi Rock is one of my favorites.  I generally order Crabstick Salad Maki, Kani Su, Eel Maki and Kani Nigiri.  Everything is always fresh and delicious, which is what you want when eating anything raw (Eel and Kani Nigiri.)  The rice to fish ratio is always excellent, and I've never had sushi with too much rice.    I've never ordered any of their other food, so I can't offer an opinion either way.  Yes, it's loud, which is very annoying.  Yes, the service usually sucks, especially Downtown.  Yes, the place is full of douchebags on most nights.  These reasons are why I knocked my rating down to 4-star.  I've found that sitting upstairs (Downtown) greatly reduces the volume, and you can hold a somewhat normal conversation. The service is truly terrible at both locations.  Examples include taking forever to receive your sushi, waiting forever for drink refills, snotty hostesses, clueless waitresses and not receiving napkin/chopsticks/soy until 20 minutes after the sushi arrived.  I always go on Tsunami night (Wednesday Downtown & Thursday Beachwood,) to ease the pain.  When I'm only paying $3.25-$4.50 per roll, the horrible service and general atmosphere can be overlooked.    Parking is a breeze in Beachwood, where you can park in the garage or in the lot right in front of the restaurant.  Downtown is a slight pain, with on-street parking your only option, or valet.    Now I want sushi."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Ive had way better. The rolls were just ok. I wouldn't say the fish was very fresh, not fishy or bad but nothing distinctive to say that I was eating great sushi. The service was fine, nice but very quiet. The price is average for sushi rolls. There is nothing that I tasted that would have me going back here again. Even the edamame was bland with no salt."}
{"text":"This would be 3.5 for me. We typically order Sushi Rock for delivery and have enjoyed it a lot, so when we happened to be in the area of their physical location we decided to go in for AYCE dinner before a movie.  Service is polite as we expected (when ordering delivery they've always been really nice and includes extra salad dressing for me). I'm Asian and used to waving someone down for service but I notice other reviewers felt like the service here was poor. They cleared plates off the table quickly and refilled water without me asking and that's all I really care about.  Food and and quality of fish is average. The Dragon on Fire is incredibly yummy and my favourite thing to get. Their house salad is my favourite in the city.   Overall the price of their AYCE is not on par with the quality of other Japanese AYCE restaurants in that bracket. I'd still order delivery from here but probably not come back for AYCE.  Within our immediate neighbourhood this is still probably one of the better places to go"}
{"text":"There is better sushi to be had; however the sushi here is decent. The atmosphere is trendy and modern, great for late night. The service is below average, and service is very slow even when the restaurant is completely empty (both the kitchen and the waiters). I go here occasionally because it's at La Place, but if Pacific East were also at La Place, clearly I would never go to Sushi Rock. Pacific East is far and away better than Sushi Rock in food and in service."}
{"text":"All show but weak food. You know there are issues when the hostesses are posturing divas. Creative rolls just didn't make impress. More of a scene than a restaurant."}
{"text":"WOW! I did not expect to find good sushi in Cleveland but this place is good enough to make it in Manhatten.  The spicy mayo sauce is SPICY! If you like unagi then get the Cobra Roll, (Hint, it's not on the menu.)  The sashimi scallops comes in a great cucumber cup"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Only a bit overpriced if it was decent sushi, but way too much for what you end up with here. The wait staff seemed apathetic and our dude didn't really know how spicy this one roll was, basically talked us into it, and it was so spicy we couldn't eat it, even with our party's LoVe of the hot stuff. No one seemed to care if our meal was going well, we were there early on a friday night and the place wasn't full, but we only saw our waiter sparingly.   I will say that both of the Mojitos we ordered were good (although, once again, I asked the waiter the price of the mojito I got before I ordered it and it was four dollars more than what our clueless dude told us when the bill came.........wtf?)  Pros- Decent bar drinks, the Jade Mojito was good  Cons-Sushi didn't have the freshest appearance. the colors were duller than I'd usually like to see with raw protein 0:), the spicy tuna is so spicy it overpowered the roll.  Oh, and the easiest way to sum up a sushi place? Trust the seaweed. The seaweed here was dry-ish and quite chewy. Icky.  I hope Cleveland comes up with some better sushi places the next time I cruise through."}
{"text":"The sushi itself is pretty good quality (nothing exciting, though).  I definitely have a problem with the atmosphere, though - I absolutely love high end dining, but Sushi Rock takes itself a little too seriously.  I think all the flash and loud music is a little over the top and cheesy.  It's like they are trying to present an ultra-cool NYish image, but it doesn't come off so cooly."}
{"text":"This is actually a review for the sushi rock out in Beechwood, however I can't seem to find it on Yelp.   So when I asked co-workers about sushi in Cleveland, they all suggested Sushi Rock, especially on wed (1/2 price) downtown, and Thursday (beechwood).  Well we tried to go on Wed., but by the time we got out there, there was a wait until 10pm (oddly enough the time when the 1/2 price specials are over).  We ended up going to Sushi Rock out in Beechwood instead.  The set up was pretty nice.  We had about 10 people with us, so they jammed us into 2 booths next to each other.  My co-workers and I looked over the menu, and started having at it.  The combinations looked pretty similar to other restaurants, but we tried a number of different rolls to get a good mix.  Wen the food came out, nothing really jumped off the page at me.  The sashimi was alright, and the rolls were pretty average.  I guess all that hype brought the meal down quite a bit.  It was alright, but I'm sure if you tried harder, you could find a better place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for Happy Hour. They have a great menu of food including sushi for $4 and they also had martinis. I think we tried every martini of theirs that were for the price. There were 4 of us. We had the creamsicle, cosmopolitan, lemonade stand, and something else. The bartender was very attentive and nice. I ordered my first drink and told her that I liked something with mangos, and so she made something with that. I think any bartender that comes to accommodate their customers deserves a star.   The place is very chic and modernized. Great place to hang out and great location on W.6th. They also have a 2nd floor which I didn't get to check out but the crowd at that time were people like us who just got off of work and it was time for some great happy hour!  I'd come again."}
{"text":"I've come to Sushi Rock about 3-4 times, each time when I'm in town for work. The maki rolls are decent but I love love love the seaweed salad. Not sure what they use to dress it, but definitely worth trying, even if it is $7. Avoid Tsunami night - even though some maki/sushi is half price, you wait forever to get them."}
{"text":"We went on a saturday around 6:15pm, and the place was pretty empty (but then again what isn't in downtown Cleveland ::rimshot::) which was nice. The interior is very hip and I loved the lighting. Staff was very cheerful, and i found the menus to have plenty of explanations for those of us who don't know every sushi roll in the book.  The food came out quickly, and while i can't say the sushi knocked my socks off, i can't come up with any honest complaints either. It was pricey, but the atmosphere made me feel like it was worth it."}
{"text":"meh. nothing special. tastes alright, not disgusting. only worth it on half priced sushi night... and still possibly not worth the required drink you have to purchase to get half price. and for the record, i love sushi A LOT."}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi option around this area. The restaurant looked dated, and the food was not the best. I ended up feeling a little sick after eating here. I mostly ate sashimi, so maybe the fish was not in its best condition, or was not fresh enough."}
{"text":"I moved to Ohio about a year ago and have been searching for a good sushi place since. I heard this place was pretty good... *sigh*. Our experience was less-than mediocre; very boring. Let the search continue."}
{"text":"Sea Bass is amazing...  the white tuna sashimi melts in your mouth.  Next time I am in Cleveland this is going to be on my list of places to come back to."}
{"text":"This place is more hype and less substance. Both this location and the downtown location have a half-price night, which is the only time I go. If you love sushi, go to SASA Matsu or Pacific East (or Shuhei if you feel like spending more money for the same thing). If you like *OK* sushi with a well-dressed upscale (or wanna-be upscale) crowd, then go here. In summary: I would go here unless I was meeting my friends and had no choice in the matter."}
{"text":"Over-hyped, over-dressed, and under-quality. Go to SASAmatsu, Pacific East or Shuhei instead."}
{"text":"Decent sushi with moderately good service.  A little pricey for the area.  I went here with a friend to clear up a bet from golf earlier in the day.  Just order the sushi boat for a large order with good variety.  Plenty of sushi for two.  Small and busy."}
{"text":"Their food literally doesn't taste like anything. No seasoning or marinade at all in their beef teriyaki. Teriyaki sauce is literally just dumped onto it. Just another sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This is where I first discovered and subsequently fell in love with sushi. Sushi Rock does and they do it well! Super cool ambiance as well!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay maybe I was a little harsh in my previous review. Tried sushi at the Downtown location which was by no means great, but it's certainly better than the stuff you buy at a grocery store. Sushi rock would not be my choice for sushi alone, but for ambiance, drinks combined with sushi and a place to hang out with friends its not a terrible option."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Sushi Rock was a dinner spot we picked while in a rush. We went on a friday night, and it was packed. A little tip though- there's a parking lot in the back, but be prepared to walk by a dumpster on your way in with raw fish.   We were told the wait would be around 30 minutes, there were no open chairs and the bar was full so we stood. It actually turned into only about a 15 minute wait, but we soon found out why. We were seated in what I presume is the dance floor on some nights. The two lounge chairs were both comfortable, but they put a small cocktail table between us to eat on.   I ordered the lobster bisque, and a California roll with a spicy tuna roll to start. These 2 rolls are pretty universal and safe, a good jumping off point when new to a sushi restaurant.  The bisque came in a nice bowl, and was edible but strangely reminiscent of something I'd had on an airline about a year earlier. It was most likely pre-prepared or frozen. Fairly disappointing, but I hadn't given up.  Our sushi arrived and while wrapped well, was fairly unremarkable.They did have a great plate presentation though. However, spicy tuna rolls as the name implies requires 2 things. First, high grade tuna, second a nice spicy kick and finish. I just didn't see it in this roll. The California roll is safe, but it will put you to sleep (boring), then again most do.  The price point was fairly high for the caliber of food, and the ambiance we saw on our visit was pretty irritating. This is a restaurant/bar geared towards younger singles. It would be a good spot to possibly meet singles, grab a cocktail. And I will admit the restaurant is well decorated. But alas, sorry Sushi Rock, you're just not for me. I'll stick to Lure bistro in Willoughby."}
{"text":"They got rid of my favorite roll ever.  The dynamite roll.  And the sushi chefs \"forgot\" how to make it.    Instead, I got the spicy crunch roll instead.  It was not good.  It was like a gigantic spicy tuna roll.  Yuck.  Damn you Sushi Rock, damn you!"}
{"text":"Half price sushi every wednesday! The red snapper is probably the best i've ever had anywhere. Prices are average for sushi bar and their open late. Also have great martinis here! Cool atmoshpere and very good location. Several other bars and reastaurants within walking distance to if your going out after dinner."}
{"text":"a friend and i were in bowling green, ohio for an orientation for school and for our last night in ohio, we decided to rent a car and drive out to cleveland. she wanted to try sushi rock after reading a little blurb about it in a \"discover what clevelands about\" type of magazine. she liked the idea of a \"live dj\" haha i didnt expect much, since im pretty picky about what i consider \"good\" sushi. anyway, so we walk in  us: two please hostess: do you have reservations? us: no... hostess: oh! its ok! right this way...  it was pretty nice in side. they have a bar area in the front and then a sushi bar in the back and a few tables here and there and then an upstairs with big booths and tables, which is very dimly lit. maybe half of the downstairs was filled but we were taken upstairs, where there were only about 3 tables taken. and then we noticed that those other tables were occupied by OTHER asians like ourselves.  hmm... jokingly we said to each other \"is this where they seat the asians?\" but maybe we really did feel that way because as the night when on, there were more asians being sat upstairs... weird.  anyway, our waiter was very nice. great service. he recommend anything that was a sushi rock signature item. so i got the beef sushi. sounds nasty but it was this beef tenderloin in a sake and soy sauce reduction i think. very tender and very tasty! it came with two little pieces of sushi rice (like a strong vinegar taste. kind of awkward for me with the beef) and this \"mushroom stick\" thing, that looked like one of those cigar like pastry things with this weird tasting cream sauce with mushrooms inside. i just ate all the beef...   my friend ordered the lobster crab cakes which were pretty tasty. it came with this spicy sauce which went really well with the crab cakes.  we also ordered a sushi rock roll (Shrimp, crabstick, salmon, spicy tuna, asparagus, masago) and a rock and roll (Shrimp tempura, crabstick, avocado, cucumber). the rock and roll was just OK but the sushi rock roll was pretty good. definitely too big to try and eat in one bite.   i ordered a peach mojito which was made with peach puree. pretty tasty. my friend got one of their red wines and said it was pretty good too.  if you ever go, i definitely recommend the beef sushi."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decent food. But service was average. Very slow and restaurant was not busy. At least 4-5 people servicing me at different times and not consistent. Would come again but curious what other options in the area to try first."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock wasn't as bad as I thought it would be based on these reviews, but it definitely didn't blow my mind either. It's not the best or freshest sushi I've had in Cleveland, but I would be okay eating here again (only for half-price sushi though.. I'd probably never pay full-price here). We tried one of the large rolls which was my favorite part, and the nigiri was definitely the most disappointing - probably because it was more obviously not fresh tasting.  Our server seemed a little inexperienced but was nice and attentive. The restaurant didn't feel dirty, but it didn't feel warm and clean to me for some reason. Overall, I'd come here again if someone else wanted to, but I think that there are definitely other places where you can get better sushi for the same price."}
{"text":"As of yesterday, this place has officially closed. Sushi Rock started going down hill around 2011 and continued to plummet to levels below belief, especially when you consider the highs it once soared to.  I just wish I had the recipe for the sauce they used to toss their fried calamari and shrimp in.   The place smelled like it had been cleaned using rancid dish towels and their sushi smelled the same the last time I was here; dirty menus, bad service and overpriced portions are the only things left here. Buyer beware, I wouldn't be surprised if everyone walked away from here with food poisoning."}
{"text":"The seared tuna is worst entree ever. Sushi is ok but not worthy of the price.  Server kept us waiting for ten minutes. The menu looks very dirty. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I regularly go to the Sushi Rock at Yonge and Eglinton (about once every other week or so).  I am surprised the reviews are so terrible!   I usually get the same things (Kamikaze roll and sweet potato tempura/avocado roll) and they always taste really good and really fresh. There was ONE time that the sweet potato in the one roll tasted like it was stale or overcooked, but they quickly took it away at my request and brought me a new one.  Other than that I love Sushi Rock because the food always tastes really good and fresh, and comes out promptly.   The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don't think the service is the best. Their intentions seem good enough but I have gotten used to having to always flag down a server if I want something. Overall the place is pretty casual; nothing fancy to be seen here."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened yesterday and is owned by the people who run Green Onion (Korean Grocery store on Neil).  The place has a modern feel with a pretty good layout but they seemed to be lacking in decorations, probably because they just opened.   The menu for lunch is pretty basic and has your usual dragon rolls, spicy tuna and california rolls, along with some interesting twists like the \"911 roll\" (spicy spicy tuna), Mango roll and Sunset roll (All moderately priced). I went with a bunch of people and we all got the Udon + Spicy Tuna + California roll lunch special, for a cheap price of $8!!   California rolls were surprisingly yummy with some tempura crunches on it along with some sweet sauce, and the spicy tunas weren't bad either. Udon was pretty good too, though it's still your basic udon. I didn't try their bento boxes, but they seemed to give you a decent amount for the price. I'll probably try that the next time I come.  If you're going to go for lunch, try to order before 12 because that's when it starts to get busy and your orders will take a lot longer to come in.  Overall the place is not bad. Not your best place, but not bad. If you're looking for a fairly cheap, simple japanese meal for lunch on Green Street, this place would be a good choice.  PS. The also have some Korean dishes in the menu which I haven't seen or tried but I'd guess they weren't too bad since they own a Korean grocery store as well."}
{"text":"I liked it. I don't think I would order takeout from here again but dining in is fine. It's not a luxurious sushi place, but you knew that. The rolls and udon are yummy. I didn't get the \"bad sushi taste\" that accompanies the food at some other places, but I also haven't tried their nigiri for a full, uncluttered tasting. I'd go back. Their lunch specials are a nice deal."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had in my life. The server does not give you the time of day. Would not let me pay extra for brown rice and just totally ignored us. If I could give them a zero I would. We walked out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love sushi rock, is my all-time favorite sushi restaurant in Northeast Ohio. They are a bit pricey, but in my opinion I believe it is worth it due to the size of The sushi rolls you get it. The rolls are very big, packed full of the ingredients! GREAT TASTE!!! I have had sushi all of the U.S., from NorthEast Ohio, to Tucson Arizona, all the way to Las Vegas in the Palazzo! This is my favorite!   The service is nice- every time I have been there. Quick, and visit when you need it, not when they want to. They don't bother repeatedly like other restaurants.   We have ordered the wedge salad and it was absolutely delicious, my all-time favorite wedge salad as well. Everything in the salad was balanced well not too much feta, not too much not, but too much this or that.  The ambience of the restaurant is great for a mid evening or dinner time. Or even great for business meeting since you can take your time, not be bothered, and enjoy the food.   Also the full bar well!"}
{"text":"We had take out from Sushi Rock tonight.  Between the two of us we had 2 Dragon on Fire rolls and 1 Four Seasons Roll.  The Dragon on Fire from Sushi Rock is probably the best roll available in the city.  We have it every time we go.  Actually, it's the reason we go to Sushi Rock.  Absolutely delicious!  The price is $11 per roll.  Eating in at Sushi Rock is a standard sushi experience.  The place is clean and busy.  Sometimes a bit too busy - causing things to slow down.  It's never too long though."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi!  Had the \"Best Friend\"... Tasty, but circumference WAY too larged to consume in single bites.  Sashami was high quality.  The atmosphere was \"hip\" and they where flexible with seating.  Seating was tight and they gave us the option to go to back room.  Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has definitely gone downhills. I have been in for a while while I used to be a regular Thursday night guest. I made a reservation for 7 pm and stopped in with a friend. First of all, we were given some broken sauce dish. The appetizer portion was cut to half. (Calamari) We waited forever for a glass of water. The dinning room was empty on this half-price night. Music was blaring from some awful sound system!!! At some point, we just stopped talking to each other because we could barely hear each other. It might have been one of the worst dinning experience we have ever had for a while. It was way disappointing than I could explain here."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Rock last night for dinner -- at the Beachwood, Ohio location.  Sat down and received our wine and edamame fairly quickly but all of the people at tables around us were complaining about the wait -- greater than one hour and still had not been served their ordered dinners.  Then we noticed that certain individuals received their dinners while others at the same table were still waiting and waiting.  At one point, the sushi was brought out to the table next to ours and the customers said -- \"that's not what we ordered.\"  They then left.  Several diners asked for the bill and walked out.  Our waitress came around very infrequently.  The hostess did not seem engaged with what she was supposed to be doing.  The manager talked to our discontented neighboring diners and tried to explain that the sushi chefs were very busy.  Not a convincing argument!!  But, oddly enough, there were really not that many people in the place between 8-9 pm on a Wednesday night.  I too am a manager of a small organization and so I was very interested in trying to figure out what was going on.   Our food arrived -- not what we ordered!  -- but the waitress recovered quickly and we had our order.  We overheard the waitress say \"Everyone is telling me that the food is not what they ordered.\"  Our food was good, but not great.  We finished our meal and were ready to leave, but no waitress in sight for quite some time.  So, we went up to the hostess station and no hostess in sight.  It seemed that the staff all kept hanging around the sushi bar in the back.  Finally, the hostess came over to us and we said we wanted to pay our bill.  She had to find our waitress.  Half-price wine night was advertised so we asked about that marketing gimmick since we did not have half-price on our glasses of wine.  The waitress went in search of an answer and we thought \"oh no, we've lost her again!!!\"  But she came back to tell us that only the bottles of wine are half-price on Wednesday nights.  Pretty misleading advertising!!!   WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO SUSHI ROCK AND WOULD ADVISE YOU TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AS WELL."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but I have had better."}
{"text":"They get the 4 stars because of one thing... KANI SU.  Why it is so hard to find this anywhere (asking the sushi chefs even has not yielded it) is beside me, but I wish more places had it on the menu and were willing to make it.  I mean, how hard is it to wrap Crabstick and Avocado in cucumber?  My husband (before we were married) had resorted to buying a yanagi knife and learning to make it for me (which yielded him 10 stars in my personal opinion, and led to me marrying him).    The specialty rolls are good, and large!  I loved the Rock and Roll.  The service here was great, we seemed to always have a few of the same servers with each visit (which was weekly or bi-weekly most times).  This was nice as they often knew what we wanted.  Generally decent and fresh, we were usually pretty happy here (same can be said for downtown)."}

{"text":"One of my favourite places about town. They are consistently good, super friendly, food is fresh and tasty, haven't had a disappointing dish yet.  Eat there regularly and change up my choices all the time to try something different.  I say thanks for working so hard to make us happy and give us good tasty fresh food"}
{"text":"Came here to have lunch with a few friends. They are kinda pricey, but their lunch deals are definitely worth it! You can mix and match different items, including bento boxes, noodle soups, sushi, teriyaki, etc. I payed about $10 and my meal came with a large bowl of udon noodle soup and a side of 4 pieces of spicy tuna sushi and 4 more pieces of California roll. I left feeling full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Went there for a work social.  I was surprised that this place was like a sushi Hooters.  Don't get me wrong, if I could pull off what the girls were wearing, I probably would.  My taste is just a little different & I was under the impression that it was classier.  Loved the bar and the seating area they provided for us.  The sushi was great, as was the service.    Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but the food has become mediocre over the last few years! Step it up SR!"}
{"text":"I came here for a way early dinner on a Saturday afternoon, around 5:30pm.  There was only one other party, the bar was open, and so my dinner companion and I sat at the bar, ordered sushi from a very friendly bartender, and some wine.  Perhaps she liked us, the crowd was minimal, and so she tipped our glasses off from time to time.    The sushi rolls were totally legitimate.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"It looks like they have just given up trying.  Went to Tsunami Night for the first time in a couple months.  The place was half empty.  Sitting down at our table, the chair had a huge food stain in it.  When the sushi finally came I could not eat more than two pieces.  The rice was not cooked properly and the fish did not taste right."}
{"text":"What a dump. (*out of towners beware*)  Tigers road trip stop 1 \"Sushi Rock\".  It was obvious from the second we sat down cleanliness is not a concern of the staff here at Sushi Crock.  Our menus were covered in a mixture of soy sauce & sticky pop.  Folks I can't even make this next one up, they were out of cucumber!    Could this place have gotten any crappier? The answer was yes, yes it can! As our server passed out side plates for our lame looking sushi with brown chuncks of avocado we couldn't help but notice that every side plate in the stack were filthy and looked as if he grabbed them from the dirty end of dish tank .  As soon as I realized this place is hazardous for me & my family's health, I politely declined the sushi and had both the flat pops & entrees removed from my bill. We couldn't get out of there quick enough.  I was even more shocked from the looks we received for not wanting to eat their visibly bad sushi on dirty plates served with nasty pops.   What a joke.    Metro Detroiters, take your hard earned money elsewhere.  other highlights *the lights above our head were dusty & had burn holes in the fabric *pops were ALL flat! *service sucked *server stole money from a wallet a guest left behind.  What a mistake! I can't wait to read this review in 6 months when you're closed.   Note to Management: Thanks for returning all my emails.  Who steals cash from a guest's wallet in an empty restaurant?  Note: Closed 6 months later."}
{"text":"1 star because the lobster bisque soup was deeeeelicious.  Sushi was 'meh' and service was extremely poor yet, the restaurant was quite slow. (We were seated immediately and there were plenty of open seats)  Shame on my friends for recommending this place.  Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"One of the nicest and clean places on campus. The food is pretty good although they could've serve more food. The bento boxes, particularly kimchi pork is pretty good. I would recommend that dish then any udongs. Overall, not a bad place to try Japanese / Korean food."}
{"text":"What can I say....its sushi. They've been around for years. Weds you need a reservation for half priced sushi night. A few of my favorites are the Big Mouth (spicy), Spider (soft shell crab) and Caterpillar.  Sounds funky but they are the big rolls.  Plus they have my all time favorite dish....Kani Su (spelling?) its a bit of crab wrapped in a peeled cucumber and soaking in a light vinegar type.  Very light and I think I could eat 5 appetizers of these things."}
{"text":"Sushi rock roll was ok, I also got the calamari app and it was also just ok. Last time I got the beef sushi appetizer which was really good. I'll just wait for another groupon before I come back here"}
{"text":"This is one of my fave sushi restaurants in the City.  I try to go when I'm in the Yonge/Eg area.  Love love love Dragon on Fire, and the 4 seasons, and that you can sub for brown rice at the nominal charge (I think it's a dollar extra).  I normally order their rolls b/c they're unique and you can't get them anywhere else.  The service is passable - They're pretty nice, and they bring food as quickly as they can.  I'd recommend, particularly if you order the items noted above.  They also have a super delish tuna tataki, and beef enoki.  Loving sushi is the reason I won't convert to vegetarianish.  It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi.  Limited menu for those who do not want to eat sushi.  Service was OK.  Food was well prepared with good portions for price.  Not the best sushi in town, but not the worst either."}
{"text":"They pre-cut the fish at the sushi bar. It looked dried-up and mutilated. Any decent sushi chef should be able to cut the product to order. I did not stay."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good with decent prices and the waiter was really nice and helped us picking our orders sh would really recommend! Not lots of sitting area though"}
{"text":"I usually only come to Sushi Rock during its half off days. Compared to other sushi restaurants in the area, I think Sushi Rock's is only a-okay. They could do better in their quality and amount....specially with the price that they are charging (hence why half off days are worth it!).   Sushi Rock (the one @ beachwood) is good for its atmosphere, i think. At least that's why I usually come here.. but I must say, they have got to work on their service a bit more. I sat out in the patio because it was such a nice day out, and our waiter was pretty darn slow. We got seated without any utensils or soy sauce. And once we got our food, we had to wait another 10 - 15mins for a different waiter (because our waiter forgot) to bring us out our utensils. Then it took an even longer time to get our bill.  Overall, I'd say their sushi is okay quality. But if you want to go on a date or want a good atmosphere, then Sushi Rock would be nice."}
{"text":"Went back last week. Raised their prices for Tsunami night, the sushi was so average. The Giant Eagle in Legacy village has better tuna and salmon rolls and I do not mean that as an insult to Giant Eagle, It is better than most restaurants. I shit you not. This place is downgraded to 2 stars. But hey everyone looks good here. But you can not say your a sushi connoisseur if this your favorite place. Fun place and hip scene, average overpriced sushi."}
{"text":"I was invited  by someone who knows her sushi,  She maybe my equal and or more awesome than I,  on many levels.   We had to be mindful that  we were ordering for a person who has not eaten much uncooked fish.  A couple of other challenges were, that the newb did not like salmon, and we do not like eel.  We ordered several large rolls and regular makis that had a variety of cooked and uncooked fish. We unfortunately did not order a ton of sashimi  due to the newbie factor.  The fish to rice ratio was not as high as I prefer.(like some places that are on the corner of Mayfield and Coventry)  Tip - when ordering sushi and the rice spirals around the fish, it may look cool, but that means you are eating a sh*t ton of sushi rice!   Manhattan roll had more avocado than tuna! WTF, if I wanted that much avocado I would have ordered chips and guac!  Well I might be embellishing a bit! However,  for 7 bucks more FCUK'n fish please.  The roll with softshell crab with  other things was off. I ate one piece and something tasted funny.  When rolls are made lots of different ingredients and sauces, its a bit more challenging to enjoy the simplicity of sushi. Anyhow, I approached my second piece and started to sample the contents of the roll and found something was bad, I asked my counterpart to taste the ingredient that I suspected was bad, and she agreed as well.  The manager promptly removed the item and offered to replace it with another Item of our choice.  The manager removed this item from our bill and handled this situation as professionally as possible.  The rest of the dinner went with out incident.  Our server was  incredibly attentive and  friendly. The water glasses never reached empty.  I was pleasantly surprised that there were some people whom had worked at Mallorca are now at the \"Rock\"   Some of the other rolls which I can not remember the names of, but had things like shrimp tempura, spicy sauce,  mayo and some veggies, were quite tasty, our newbie, lets call him Joe, enjoyed the other large rolls as well. Joe who claimed to not like salmon enjoyed the Alaskan  (salmon and avocado) quite a bit. The salmon was very fresh, it melted  like butter upon the \"Chew\"."}
{"text":"Sushi is one of the things I love most about being alive.    I'm not even being dramatic.  When done well, it is like a smooth rush of flavor and texture and doesn't make you feel fat.  Well, with the amount of sushi hubby and I eat, it is possible.  But, I digress.  Dear friends of ours took us to Sushi Rock and West Side Market in the same day, and they swore that we were in for a treat!  The market was like Disneyland for me, but the restaurant did little to impress.    The ambiance is chill and the waitstaff is modish.  But, that's kind of the best part. The food was just mediocre.  The sushi rolls were flavorful but huuuge, which made them really difficult to eat, the rice was dry and gummy, no tempura on the menu, and maybe it was just me?  But, I think we came at the end of their lunch hour, which seemed to effect our service.  I had to ask for my tea three times and didn't get it until the end of the meal.  I can't see hubby and I racing back here, but if we did, I think we would try an evening happy hour or 1/2 price night."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the average rating here on yelp. This is close to the worst sushi I've had anywhere.  Rolls were small, dry, and not very fresh. I find it hardly worth the price even on half-off sushi happy hour night, not to mention how long it takes to get your food. To their credit, it gets super busy on these nights, so if you're hungry, try to get your entire meal in one order. If you finish your sushi and put in for another order, be prepared to WAIT. More often than not you won't be hungry anymore by the time your second order arrives.  I will say that their calamari is AMAZING, and it alone probably saves this place from the dreaded 1 star rating.  Misc... Decor is modern chic. Service is pretty friendly and attentive. Pay parking lots near by. Happy hour specials for drinks are ok but cheaper options are available all over W 6th.  This place benefits from being one of the only sushi-serving restaurants downtown. If you aren't restricted to the area, venture east to Pacific East for some real sushi. Or west to Tomo in Strongsville. Or even the Sushi Rock location in Beachwood, which for some reason has a lower rating despite having better sushi."}
{"text":"Quick though quiet service. Delicious miso soup, dynamite roll (shrimp tempura) and futomaki roll. Clean, modern decor."}
{"text":"I had layover in Cleveland. My local chef here in NY told me he worked at this place so I gave a try.   To my surprise the sushi was great, I had usual rolls to avoid any heart break but perhaps next time I will try the real sushi. Every rolls were awesome.   Parking is easy. When I was there the place was packed, I guess sushi is special food in Cleveland!? Also good place for lunch as well."}
{"text":"Went here at 2:57 p.m. on a Saturday following Dad's Day football game.  Green street sidewalks were packed with the crowd following a football game at which 60,000 people were present.  First words out of our server's mouth were \"You need to order right away because the kitchen closes at 3:00\" Are you kidding me? On so many levels that was wrong.  Stupid not to adjust kitchen hours to match circumstances, and stupid to greet us that way.  Its not like we were going to linger long in this semi-fast-food campus restaurant before we ordered, but now we really felt rushed. The food is usually good, I've been there several times, but this time the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box was not great; the tempura veggies were a clump of greasy onions.  The Miso soup is a good addition and the spicy tuna and California sushi rolls we also ordered were decent but nothing special. The advantage to this place was the speed and value, yet it was clear the waiter was in a hurry. He was pleasant, but brought the food out as soon as everything came ready despite the fact that we were still having our soup when he set the bento boxes on the table.  An additional ten minutes might have been nice.  And he delivered the check without us asking while we were still eating.  There is a time and a place for that speed, like at an interstate truck stop. It gets three stars because of value, but it has a schizophrenic atmosphere.  Is it trying to be a nice place or is it the McDonalds of Bento Boxes?"}
{"text":"How on earth is this place still open?! The last time I was here, the sushi I ordered was NOT fresh. Overpriced for a place that has lousy food & sushi that wasn't fresh. I'm avoiding this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Wow. A few of my friends convinced me to go here after school one day over the summer and I reluctantly went. (Peer pressure got the best of me) I have much experience eating sushi and traditional Japanese food across the U.S. and in Asia, and let me just say, they should just change the name to Bate Rock. The sushi I ordered was not fresh or properly prepared. So many of the items on the menu contained dairy. Why?? This is simply not right. When I go to a place to get sushi, I expect it to be done right. I don't expect a weird version of bagel w/cream cheese and lochs in the form a sushi roll. It's unfortunate that people really believe that this is 'good' sushi. The quality of fish used was bad and way over priced.  I wouldn't use this stuff as chum for fishing for sharks! If you see this place, tuck tale and run.   If I could give it zero stars, I would have."}
{"text":"Love sitting outdoors here in the summer. Good food. A little pricey but it may be worth it. They also make GREAT drinks."}
{"text":"Great lunch place, with reasonable prices.   The Sushi Rock combo is good and will fill you up (soup, salad, nigiri and a spicy salmon roll for around $15.)   It's on the same block as Absolute Comedy, which makes it a great place to take a date for a pre-show dinner."}
{"text":"Half price sushi Wednesdays is amazing. I love the choices, the atmosphere, and the service. It was not as crowded as it was last time, major plus. Besides I got about 40 pieces of sushi for less that $35, pretty cool right. I say try it out, it's a really nice date night place"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the great quality of sushi from Sushi Rock. The standout items for me were the Four Seasons roll, barbecue eel and the Crunch roll. I'm giving a 4 star because there is room for improvement but regardless, it's definitely my new favorite neighborhood sushi place!!"}
{"text":"we stopped in while passing through.  good sushi, although the waiter seemed amazed that we'd actually had sushi before!  he did walk us through a complicated menu, and we found what we liked just fine.  a little pricey but not horridly so."}
{"text":"Sushi rock does not rock. I went for dinner and lunch and both times, it was overpriced for the portion and the quality. I love salmon so I got their sunrise roll and their salmon avocado roll. I barely finished half of what I ordered because it was just unappetizing. Their salmon was sort of tasteless... and I was really looking for that salmon-y flavor.   Isn't anyone else outraged that they charge $0.99 for miso soup? When I went to sushi places this summer soup and salad were usually given for free. Actually, I can't recall a sushi place that ever charged for miso soup...   One star for their cheeseballs."}
{"text":"I sat down at the bar and the bartender greeted me quickly.  She was friendly and nice enough throughout the time I was there.    That is where the positivity ends for me.  I ordered a Moscow Mule.  It is 2014 people; who uses Roses Lime \"juice\" over fresh?  It also had St. Germain in it - weird to me and the drink was not good.  The place was very visibly dirty behind the bar.  The food.  I ordered the house salad which was so overdressed.  The dressing was basically oil as well.  Then my Sushi Rock Roll came out.  The food was not good.  The tuna was not as high of quality that I would have expected.  I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Sushi Rock is a great place to enjoy delicious sushi.The happy hour is always something to loo forward to. There are many different choices to select from and it's a great environment to have a relaxing evening. The major downside to this place, and the main reason why I am not giving it a higher rating is the service. The only time I have had good service was last night. Other than that, their service is terrible. The waiters and hostesses are very obnoxious and outspoken and make it a big deal. If you don't say anything to them, they will walk all over  you, but if you put your foot down and make sure you let them know they are your servers, they will all of a sudden be \"nice\". I love food, and sushi for that matter, but the last thing I ever need when I dine out is for sub par service."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Rock dozens of times because my son loves their wanton soup. The sushi is disgusting. Old, stinky fish. The service can be very hit and miss. The sushi chefs are slow and sloppy. The kitchen staff consistently undercooks broccoli and over cook fish, sprouts, vegetables, etc.   Definitely a place to avoid. Other sushi in the area isn't great, but Sushi Rock is the worst."}
{"text":"The only reason we went here was because we had a Groupon, which turned out to be a good thing, due to the severely over priced food. Seems to be all the money is put towards the decor, although the seat I sat on had a very large and disgusting dark stain. The music was very loud and overpowering. Also, not exactly fitting to the finer dining experience they try to convey.     The description advises you to dress casually but we were very under dressed. We were delighted to find Kampyo under the vegetarian menu they show online, but when we ordered the server had never remembered having that item in the restaurant. If we had gone solely based on their deceptive online menu we would have left very disappointed. Overall, not the experience we were hoping for, and we will not be returning. For the price the food was unsatisfactory, and the experience was mediocre. Without a coupon you can find the same sushi for half the price somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've haad better sushi from a grocery store.  Nothing to write home about with this sushi.  Although, I expect thats what you get when you're over a thousand miles from the closest ocean."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorites -- my husband and I live very close and we are sushi lovers. However, my experience last night made me NEVER want to dine in at this location ever again. The last time we ordered takeout from them, they told us they were out of tuna. How can you be out of tuna ?? Anyways, I gave them another shot and headed there on a Wednesday night when needing a close and quick place to eat.  Things started off ok. We ordered our drinks and app whch came out pretty quickly. Drinks were nice and strong and calamari is always delish there. And then we didn't see our server for over 40 minutes!!! My husband eventually had to walk to the bar himself in order to get our second drink. Not one person refilled our water glasses during that whole time. I asked two other servers if they could locate ours and she never showed.   We noticed that the table next to ours had seemingly ordered the same rolls as us. No coincidence there -- the couple sent the food back....they had received our order mistakenly. Our server never mentioned this or explained the delay. SImply whisked their plate away and didn't return for another 25 minutes after taking it. When she did finally come to give us our food, I was very honest about the poor service and told her we were well aware she had messed up. She clearly felt bad but didn't offer any thing besides a flimsy 'I'm sorry.'    Sorry Sushi Rock, we will be taking our business elsewhere! Horrible customer service that I just can't put up with no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"As a sushi restaurant, this one is okay. The sushi is fine, nothing outstanding. The prices are high for the area and quality. Not that it's bad, it's not, just over priced for what they offer. If you like LOUD rock music (I don't) this is a good place for you! I didn't realize Sushi Rock meant that until we were inside and too hungry to leave. So, it's worth the visit but the sushi is not to write home about."}
{"text":"I had the sushi rock lunch menu around noon hour. Presentation of plate was beautiful, the taste was what I was expecting, the service was efficient and quick. The lunch price was decent and fair, and I really enjoyed my meal. Was it anything special? No, it was a decently priced sushi lunch meal that was served properly. Even the restroom was above standard to many other sushi restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi you are going to get in Cleveland period. Don't go anywhere else I've pretty much tried them all. Nothing was even worth writing a review about beyond this place.  Anyway I took my girlfriend here on their notoriously busy  \"Tsunami Wednesday\" because they do half price rolls. We were warned in advance about the wait time thanks to Yelp and so we came expecting a disaster similar to what happened with Melt Bar and Grilled plopping a nice 3 and a half hour wait time on our heads.   We waited around the bar (which had open spots with fast service another difference between this and Melt). We waited there for about and hour  and change before the hostess managed to grab us a place at the sushi bar which had been completely packed along with the reservation only dining area.   Knowing what I know now I would have made reservations for a table despite loving to eat at the sushi bar and watch them make the rolls... but it was fine waiting just a little over an hour for a place that was packed with people. I'm willing to wait up to two hours for good food. None of this 3 and a half hour wait that Melt tried to pull on us. =)  So they have a DJ on Tsunami Wednesday. He was playing some of the best mixes I have ever heard. I was quite impressed. Made the wait time feel even shorter.  The food itself was half price sushi rolls as mentioned. Some of the freshest sushi I have ever had and I have tried a wide variety of locations both here and abroad. The white tuna was melt in your mouth delicious. The spicy tuna was prepared with expert perfection and fresh ingredients. Also the service was lightning fast all around from the bar to the waitress to the food.  Did around 32 pieces of sushi when all was said and done (a new record for me). Girlfriend was a newcomer to real sushi having only tried cali rolls before. She enjoyed her first taste of REAL sushi here (spicy tuna roll). Had two pitchers of sake along with desert. Left happy as hell and will definately return.  If you are going to take your special someone out on a sushi date. Make a reservation on wednesday night here and you will NOT be sorry."}
{"text":"Service wasn't good, staff wasn't friendly, never checked back- we went during lunch hour and it was dead - which is saying something for beachwood area because everywhere else is busy...sushi was rotten and fishy tasting- an server never asked why I didn't eat it (and I got two huge rolls)."}
{"text":"First of all...still great sushi. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have had great sushi each time I've visited this location and also the downtown location. But the atmosphere is completely different here than the downtown location - which is more my style. Beachwood has a more relaxed and quiet atmosphere - like it's missing the \"Rock\" part of Sushi Rock. Never the less, if you are looking for a great date place, or great sushi and you live on the east side - this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"I don't give out too many 5 star reviews, but Sushi Rock on West 6th definitely deserves it in my book! Upon finding out that my companion had never been there before, the manager treated us to free edamame...which was excellent of course! Nice touch!  The DJ was not spinning the night we were there, but it's an amazing atmosphere regardless. The booths upstairs are great for a group up to 10-15. Makes for an amazing girls night out!   Now, things happen in a restaurant - it's the recovery that is important. I asked for brown rice for my Tuna Sushi pieces (OK....how awesome is it that you can get it with brown rice?!?!?) and they came with white rice. No problem....they brought out some with brown rice in just a few minutes and as a result I got a couple extra pieces of tuna...sweet.  Don't miss their special Big Rolls that they have in conjunction with the Cleveland Browns. And on Wednesdays they have Tsunami night with half price Sushi!"}
{"text":"We went on Tsunami Wednesdays where some of the sushi is 50% off. We made online reservations for 5:30 and ended up getting there closer to 6 pm but had no trouble getting a table, only had to wait a couple minutes. Reservations are a MUST for Wednesdays because of the deal, the restaurant quickly became crowded. We were greeted by our server fairly quifkly and ordered our drinks, which were expensive but thats what you get for drinking downtown. The drinks were great and we started picking our our sushi selections which thanks to an easy ordering system, saves time. Within 15 minutes we had out sushi and WOW was it great!! You can't go wrong at Sushi Rock, we loved it all.  The best part was that price at the end of the night with the discount, it brought a regularly $80 meal down to $47. I would go again, but probably only on the 50% wednesdays since you get so much fo rthe money!"}
{"text":"You know how Burger King started serving ribs, but they're still a fast food burger joint?  That's how I feel about Sushi Rock and sushi.  It's a meat market that happens to serve raw fish.  My first two experiences were on half-price nights, and I figured... \"this isn't a fair assessment... they're churning out truckloads of sushi to a bunch of people who only eat it when it's half price, and most of the rolls are premade and refrigerated, which is just a big no-no.\"  Then, I gave it a try on a normal night and was equally unimpressed.  Often, the fish was cut improperly with respect to the grain.  The same piece of tuna can be cut to melt in your mouth or to require chewing through stringy membrane... I experienced a lot of the latter at SR.  The fish was sometimes less than fresh.  It wasn't rancid or anything - this is all relative (see my review on Shuhei).  But, it was far from swimming yesterday.  And the rice... an often overlooked component to great sushi among novices.  I learned about the importance of rice when I started making my own sushi.  First of all, it's hard to cook perfectly.  Next, it takes many years of practice to perfect the seasoning to have the right flavor.  My palate is not refined enough to be able to tell the difference between a grand master expert's rice and a mere expert's rice, but it is refined enough to know that SR's rice is junk.  It's not even cooked properly, which is unacceptable.  On most visits, it has been undercooked, which leads to a horrible experience.  If you are into the \"posh\" club scene, SR delivers.  It's a striking place to look at from the entry door.  But, if you want good (even merely decent) sushi, you'll have a hard time, here.  I wish it wasn't so... I have tried numerous times to like it.  No luck!"}
{"text":"I've probably walked by this place hundreds of times and never once thought to come here. Until my friend said we're coming here for all you can eat (AYCE) lunch on a Sunday.  Sushi Rock probably could seat about 30-40 people max and when we got here around 12:30 on a Sunday, it was only the four of us and 2 other tables. We ordered quickly, but the food took a really long time to come.   The quality was fairly on par with other AYCE sushi places. The price is $23.99 any time, lunch or dinner; with an extra $2 on the weekends. Most AYCE places I have been to costs extra at dinner because that's when they offer sashimi, but not with Sushi Rock, they offer sashimi any time of day. For that, I think the price is well justified.   My friends and I also tried to order the \"Black Pearl Roll\" which is listed on their AYCE ordering sheet. The menu says it's a roll with shrimp and salmon tempura, along with avocado, cucumber, and cream cheese, topped with BBQ eel and black caviar. The black pearl roll never came though, because we ordered it twice and both times we were brought black dragon rolls. When they brought us the second one, I sent it back and told them we never order it, they brought back the same roll and told use they only serve the black pearl roll for a la carte orders. This left me quite peeved because the black pearl roll was clearly an option for AYCE.   I super tempted to give it a 2* also because of the servers attitudes. I tried to flag a server down but was not being acknowledged. When my friend politely said \"excuse me\" to a server whose hands were full, we did not expect her to tend to us right away, but just acknowledge that we are trying to get her attention. What she actually did was giving us the worst side eye I have been given in recent times, when all she had to say was \"I'll be there in a second\" (or similar).   What I am happy about this place is the dragon on fire roll (that actually did take forever to come), and the sashimi offered at any time for AYCE. The price isn't that bad either."}
{"text":"So I wasn't expecting much from Cleveland sushi, seeing how far it is from the West Coast and, thus, how far the fish they use has to travel, and I'm adding brownie points for those low expectations. First off, Google Maps was oh-so-wrong about this place's location. It is not in the Legend Center. It is caddy-corner to the Legend Center in a strip of similarly upscale restaurants. Don't turn in to the Legend Center because it's one of those nouveau malls made to look like a \"real\" Downtown without the scary people and with only chain stores, so it's hard to get out of. I came on the Thursday for their half-off specials, and they were slammed. I was lucky enough to get one of the last seats at the sushi bar (the other two were snatched up right after I sat down) while people waited for tables and stood at the regular bar. For this Thursday special, from what I could tell, only hand rolls (Maki) are half off. The cool-sounding, well-presented, fancy rolls are full price. I watched these things go by all night and got a little jealous. Beautiful place. Very chic and hip decor, with the unassuming, art gallery opening electronic music to match. Really mixed crowd though, with a lot of after-work overdressed types and a lot of other younger (I assume) sushi fans. I was almost immediately approached by a waiter who filled my water glass and said something like \"Okay, you know the drill, let me know when you're ready\" after he saw me filling out my card. I picked a Philly (always a fav of mine, and a real test of a place, I think) and a Manhattan, which I had never heard of, but consists of tuna and avocado. Ready to give my card to the chefs in front of me, I found that there was no way to do this and this was apparently not the protocol. While I was thinking about this, the waiter (who was super-quick despite covering the entire bar) came up and took it from me. So, yeah, it's not a sushi bar in the sense of most sushi bars. It's really just a place for the losers who come in alone to sit and not feel too awkward or, maybe, pack in a few more chairs into an already crowded restaurant. While I waited, I scoped out the whole scene a bit more. Lots of 30-something I-wanna-be-seen action going on, especially in the bar area. It almost seemed like a singles, pick-up sort of place. The chefs, a mixture of about seven various Asian folks, and staffed by one Japanese man, who seemed to be the manager, were all crammed into the bar area. But they had it down to a ballet, and did not bump into one another, nor spill anything. Orders were put up and then picked up by the waitstaff. Impressively efficient, at the least, but they kept pulling the hand rolls from somewhere in the depths of the bar, which was a little disconcerting. Two of those were mine and, almost as soon as they were put up not even two feet from where I sat, my waiter grabbed them and brought them over, served on a heart-shaped plate with a typical amount of pickled ginger and wasabi. First bite was the Philly, and the first thing I noticed was that the rice was warm. Not a big deal, but it was a little off-putting. At least the rice was of good quality. And, as far as the other ingredients, the cucumber was fresh and the cream cheese was ample and pungent enough to be enjoyable. The salmon, however, had a decidedly fishy and unpleasantly aged sense to it. Yeah... So onto the Manhattan, and the first thing I notice is that the avocado is clearly past its prime. Note to restaurants: when avocado starts getting gray, it's time to put it on the value menu and try to find another vendor. It tasted old to boot, and the tuna was actually a bit chewy, although not nearly as fishy as the salmon. So, I know you're thinking \"Yum!\" right now, right? It honestly wasn't terrible, and the whole thing ran me about $8 with tip, but the thought that they were charging $6.50 for these rolls normally and calling them sushi was a little disappointing, to say the least. Like I said though, I was not expecting great sushi by any means, and I now fully understand why there are so few sushi places in the Cleveland area in the first place. I'm not the type to put emphasis on atmosphere or service. As long as the food is great, I'm willing to wait an hour, deal with dirty floors, fight with pissy staff, or whatever it takes to get my delicious on. But the atmosphere and service of this place really blew me away. The food though, not so much..."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars because some are good, and some are not.  Sushi is definitely their signature food, so it's obviously good, don't have any complaints about that. But their lunch combo! Ordered their teriyaki chicken lunch combo once, it comes with sushi, miso soup, salad, shrimp tempura and ... (is there more? Can't reminder)  When I opened my lunch box, I was expecting teriyaki chicken, like the ones selling everywhere else, but it turned out to be grilled + unsalted chicken meat. I found two small containers, one is tempura sauce and the other was diluted teriyaki sauce ( I'm assuming, because it doesn't taste like any teriyaki sauce I've had before).. So I ended up adding some salt to the grilled chicken, and ate like that.. Btw I had to peel off the really thick tempura crispy coating, 'cause it's soaked (but can't blame them since it's in the lunch box so it's expected to be soaked...)   Well overall, I'd still buy its sushi, and sushi only... Plus the service was good/okay.."}
{"text":"Well, we tried to come here. Yelp said they were open. We drove there, and it was closed. They have new summer hours. I forget what they are though. Anyways, call to see if it's open before you go. I guess we'll try it next time. I'm intrigued by the menu, some of the rolls sound like stuff I can't find anywhere else (if you know a place, let me know!)! The lava roll sounds great, so does the cali crunch. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I can not believe this place states that it ya \"good for kids\". I just walked out of that place because the hostess didn't want to have our 2 year old kids there. Let me mention I'm a regular to that place, but after this incident NEVER AGAIN! Before we were seated that hostess warned me quite aggravated that we had to keep the kids out of the way because they needed to use the hallway to go back and forth. Fine. I kindly asked if the other area would be more suitable, she said it was \"crowded\" too. -one table occupied! I started to feel the rejection and although one other server was nice to us, that woman still went to tell us that we couldn't have any high chairs (she kept on thinking on the customers she didn't have occupying any tables) At that point I confronted her and asked if she had a problem with our kids and if she did, we would leave. She started acting like a kid herself having a tantrum, mumbling something, and left me standing there. I was very upset and informed the nice server we were going to leave if our kids were not treated with respect. We left the restaurant with two very disappointed crying and extremely upset two year olds without doing anything wrong but wanting to have dinner there. I will not return to that place until that rude and disgusting woman is not there because I will not support that kind of behaviour towards any kid. That's discriminatory, bullying and plain wrong not forget that it's a big NO-NO to customer service. I truly hope they kick that woman out and she learns her lesson."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Don't walk away from this place. RUN. Not only is the food VERY mediocre, it is also over priced. I will never eat here again and waste my money and time"}
{"text":"The place is kind of loud. Service is not bad but experienced better. The food is about the same at other places but the price is way too much unless you go on Thursday AFTER 5pm. The half price off rolls are filling enough and the big rolls are not worth it for the price"}
{"text":"Food is really good and the service is always fine.   Attracts a d-b crowd and has kind of a pretentious atmosphere.  Maybe I'm just not very cool, but I prefer this as carryout."}
{"text":"My first meal in Cleveland, and I am only half impressed.  After a slow start (it took seven minutes for a waitress to even come to our table to say hi) , we ordered the vegetable roll, salmon roll, and lettuce wraps.  After insurmountable amount of time waiting, we finally got our appetizer (Seriously, how long does it take to put some already cooked chicken in sauce and then place it on lettuce wraps?). The chicken and lettuce wraps were a little too heavily marinated, and I had to brush off the sauce from the chicken in order to avoid sodium overload.   The vegetable sushi roll was humongous!  It was twice the size of the usual sushi I get from Japanese restaurants.  But it was absolutely delicious: crisp, juicy, and generous in amount, the vegetables really danced in my mouth.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  A five would be given just for this portion.  We also got the smoked salmon roll, which was equally as big.  The glob of mediocre cream cheese really did hinder the flavor from the surprisingly fresh salmon.  The kiwi on top of the roll worked, but there was overall a lack of flavor on behalf of the whole roll.  I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the Japanese American fusion nature of this restaurant.  It felt like a party/bar that really wrecked the calm ambiance of Japanese classy sushi.  I'm a big advocate for authenticity; fusion works occasionally, but in my opinion, not this time."}
{"text":"We get to the place and at first I thought I made a mistake and we walked into a club. They had hip hop pumping across the room with video monitors showing the song videos and its real crowded. The servers are all young, attractive and wearing all black. Its dark, has a huge bar and the crowd is young and hip. But we go ahead and get seated upstairs where it's equally as loud and we sit down. The seating area is cramped so I am already starting to think I don't like this place. In fact with the noise, decor and fashion, I was waiting to see poof daddy or someone similar to walk past to a VIP booth. We go ahead and order some stuff and surprisingly, it was very good. The ceviche won ton appetizer was super good and so was the Kobe beef. We order two different big rolls both of some sort of spicy tuna and different stuff inside and on top. They both were excellent. The miso soup was also perfect. The place threw me a little being so club like but the food more than made up for it. Not sure I'd make a point to go here again but the sushi was as good or better than I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is just terrible. Terrible terrible terrible, did I make my point yet?  I usually listen to fellow yelpers and avoid such spots, especially for sushi. All they have going for them is ambiance, which is decent, but not cozy at all.   Miso soup: worst I've had in my life. So unbearably oversalted, I could hardly eat it. Tasteless and just a completely terrible start.  Sushi: tried their cooked fish sushi as I was afraid to eat raw based on comments from others about freshness, or lack of it. Nonetheless, I felt sickly after eating it.  Sake: this part is hard to mess up, so it was juuuust fine!"}
{"text":"Randomly some of the best sushi I've ever had. I say \"randomly\" because I was not expecting Cleveland to be hiding some of the most crazy-ass excellent sushi I've ever had.   I haven't been to every country on the globe, although I have been around the block (ahem). And in every city I've visited, I've tried to hunt down the best sushi, and this ranks right up there with the best of them.   I kind of wish that, during the summer, along with the ice cream trucks for kids, there would be a sushi truck for adults, serving Dynamite rolls and gin slurpees."}
{"text":"Brutal.  So, had a tremendous craving for nice bright, fresh sushi.  You know the kind of sushi you actually enjoy. Well guess what? I'm still looking after dinner tonight at Sushi Rock.  In fact, I'm confident there would be better quality sushi in the fridge that's on the fritz at the Dave's on Payne and East 34th (those from Cleveland will get that).  What the hell happened to this place?  Honestly, the food used to be pretty darn good.  I would never say it was better than Pacific East (an actual sushi restaurant), but still \"good\".  The thing with sushi rock is it had the ambiance thing going for it and, to me, that gave the edge over other sushi places.  Well, tonight we're done.  Tip-off number one: Saturday night - restaurant's half-empty (appropriately pessimistic) - that's a first for this place.  Maybe people are watching the Olympics (shrug).  My wife and I were chatting about whether uni is in season and the waitress overhears us and says \"oh we have no urchin tonight.\" \"oh, and we have no scallops either\".  That was interesting because we were just commenting on how the sushi part of the menu at \"Sushi Rock\" had been relegated to the rightmost part of the one-page menu in a 1.5\" column.  At least in the prior menu they offered choices such as toro (fatty tuna), mackerel and I think a few others.  Now, we're down to tuna, yellow tuna, white tuna, salmon, egg, eel (at market price - whatever that means... It's eel), and roe.  So, in other words, 80%+ of the menu is now non-sushi.  Hmm \"Non-Sushi-Rock, Sushi-Rock-Lite, Anything-But-Sushi-Rock?  Anyway, we ordered salmon, tuna, white tuna, yellow tuna and salmon roe as well as 2 giant rolls.    Now, presentation-wise, the sushi came out pretty on a granite slab.  As we started in to the food, my wife was put-off by the pieces of skin left on the white tuna (little dabs here and there).  I also couldn't quite figure out why the fish had a glossy sheen and the taste wasn't \"off\" per sé but, just, not right.  This is exactly how my wife described it.  Getting into my second piece of tuna, I had to spit out a fish scale that wasn't too palatable.  The rolls were very stingy and they barely covered the rice real estate with sushi on the rainbow roll.  Usually, I find sushi good to the last drop.  Tonight, we left six pieces and were only too glad to see them go.  Seriously, one more bite of white tuna I think I would've thrown-up.  And, by the way, I think the sushi preparers should realize that serving sushi on lemon equals ceviche.  Yes, the sushi was starting to \"cook\" in short-order.  Good God, pray they don't decide to put fugu on the menu as a special one night because the city of Beachwood's population would go down by... well... okay... none (no customers + no one that would even know what the hell fugu is anyway).    After finishing our drinks, I started to look around and listen to the girls at the table beside us.  Now I get it.  The one young lady at the table said \"why do so many of these sushi rolls have to have fish in them?\" Two of the three of them ordered traditional Japanese side dishes - garlic mashed potatoes and truffle oil French fries.    Finally, my wife went to the washroom before leaving.  She came back and said \"well, I think I'm now done forever with this place\".  I asked \"why?\". Evidently there was no toilet paper in the stall (a sin for a lady I guess), the adjacent stall, she said, had a third of a roll, there were cleaning spray bottles strewn haphazardly over the sink area with a roll of toilet paper and a roll of garbage bags.  The garbage cans, apparently, had a plastic garbage bag roughly thrown in with no attention.    One thing, the creme brûlée was nice.  Our server was very nice.  The beer was cold.  The rest was no way worth $150.  They'd be better off taking the \"sushi\" out of the name, calling it \"Rock-Bottom\" and accepting its soon-to-be fate of the area's next Dollar General.  Again, brutal!"}
{"text":"I STRONGLY feel that this is the BEST PLACE for sushi in Cleveland. Personally, I hate Pacific East with a passion. You couldn't pay me to eat that. Wasting money is one thing but wasting space in my stomach I take seriously. And Shuhei was so blah that I felt like I didn't really eat anything at all. It left something to be desired.  Yes, Sushi Rock is trendy, but really, the food is solid. The white tuna is delicious. There is a wide variety of rolls, not just a standard California roll. No real standouts- all pretty decent.  However, I am confused by the sushi bar. A waiter still takes my order (not the sushi chef), I can't talk to the sushi chefs (they are behind glass counter and rarely look up), sushi chefs are forced to use gloves (!!), and they're Korean. Also, the whole order comes at once on a big slab and its quite overwhelming!!!  Be careful on Thursdays- the sashimi and the rolls aren't half off. To me those are the only things worth ordering anyway so I end up paying full price."}
{"text":"Sushi is OK.  This is the greasy, club hopping version of a sushi restaurant.  There are way better options in Cleveland.  Quit being a wuss and find em!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, NYC decor, friendly service, combine for a decent value.  Calling a sushi dinner a decent value seems counterintuitive.  It's not cheap by far.  But, you certainly get what you pay for, and then some.  The sushi is priced where I'd expect for the quality.  The decor and the service make it a touch better.  There were interesting rolls on the menu.  They were all creative combinations of tastes.  It seems they're trying to be a mainstream Nobu.  It's dialed back just enough to not scare off the neophytes.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about their menu.  Even better, she was able to read the mood of me and my colleague and reacted appropriately.  She was very different with another table nearby.  I guess this place is a cliché.  I'm not so sure that's a bad thing in this case.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food & atmosphere at Sushi Rock is awesome. My favorite items to get include the Bento Boxes (the chicken is yummi), the crunchy rolls, and the Udon! They have an Udon & Roll special during lunch which is a fantastic bang for your buck! I definitely miss this place since i've moved off campus!"}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place all the time. The first week of school my friends and I gathered here to have a nice dinner. The atmosphere was pretty nice and it wasn't too busy.  Sushi Rock is on a great location on Green Street near the bars and other ethnic restaurants. However, I found the sushi very disappointing. Sushi Rock was wayyy too americanized with the crunchy fried food and the limited menu. The menu consist of some of the usual Japanese dish such as rolls, gyoza, and udon, but c'mon... no sashimi and no nigiri sushi?!? What kind of Japanese Restaurant does not sell nigiri and sashimi? Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy, and California Rolls and Crunch rolls are so not Japanese cuisine. It's like saying taco bell is authentic Mexican food, sorry. =/  I really wanted to like you, Sushi Rock, but it wasn't working out. I felt like I wasn't eating real sushi even though the presentation of each dish was pretty eye-appealing. The taste wasn't right. Maybe because I'm eating raw \"fish\" in the Midwest, but I've been to a couple of good sushi restaurants in the Midwest and sushi rock did not cut it for me.  Also, our server seemed very forgetful and clueless. She took forever to pick up our checks and close our checks when the restaurant was not busy at all. Maybe she was a new server but I'll give her a star for being nice. Overall, I enjoyed my time with my friends but I did not enjoy the food."}
{"text":"\"Half off sushi rock\" has become a euphemism used to describe crappy things people with poor taste think are good. Calling someone 'half off sushi rock' is probably the most insulting thing you can say. One of the last places left in America you can still see an Affliction t-shirt worn in public."}
{"text":"In all honesty, take your sushi craving someplace else.  I can't say anything different than what everybody else already has.  DIRTY, Sloppy, overpriced, poor quality."}
{"text":"The sushi was really, really good. My only complaints are...  They were playing music videos on big screen TVs all over the place. I really hate it when restaurants have distracting TVs; it's not a sports bar, come on!  Also...  The menus were super confusing. We were given three different ones (not including the sushi slip) and they all had redundancies, but there were some things listed on some menus and not on others. It made ordering quite difficult. We even considered leaving for a moment, but didn't know where else to go. I'm glad we stuck around because the food turned out to be so good that this place still got 4 stars."}
{"text":"The sushi here is the worst quality sushi in all of Cleveland.  The sushi is not fresh and the rolls are sloppily made.  The rolls with tempura came out with soggy, cold tempura.  Especially do not come on Thursdays, because the crowds of people who come for half price sushi result in even worse quality rolls.  None of the specialty rolls are half off anyway.  Sushi rock used to have a fantastic sea bass entree (they've since taken it off).  It was sweet, succulent and cooked to perfection.  If I were to come back to this restaurant, I'd try another entree and avoid their sushi.  Also, the place is very loud and it's hard to hear yourself speak."}
{"text":"We get Sushi Rock delivered from www.delivermefood.com from Downtown Cleveland which is probably closer to 3.5-4 stars.  This branch of Sushi Rock really wasn't that great.  The Miso soup tasted nothing like the downtown Sushi Rock.  It was bland.  The rolls were messy and didn't taste great.  I was definitely disappointed with this experience."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night around 6. We didn't make reservations, but we were seated immediately. The restaurant was ~60% full.   One of the things I immediately liked was the decor. The place was decorated in a modern sleek style with 2-story backlit windows with pictures of NYC in them. Cool and swank. What I didn't like was the blaring techno. Now, I get that its called sushi ROCK, but the music was so loud I couldnt hear my friends across the table, and neither could anyone else. Result: About 50 people screaming over each other and the music. This is not a place to take your date, but if its you and some young friends hanging out, OK.   Our waiter came after about 2 minutes and explained the menu and ordering system to us. We started off with the  lamb and risotto appetizer to appease my lamb fanatic of a friend. It was tender and well cooked, but the risotto was a tad too buttery. But for a sushi place, not bad.   We decided to order 5 or 6 different sushi/sashimi dishes to split among the 3 of us as our \"entree\". It took about 15 minutes for them to come out, which isnt terrible. The spicy tuna roll was pretty good. There was a good amount of tuna and it wasnt overpowered by mayo, which I appreciate. Definitely not the best I've ever tasted, but better than most Cleveland sushi places. We also tried the \"Pretty Woman\" large roll, intrigued by the interesting combo of salmon and kiwi. Unfortunately, there was so much rice there was no way you could pop one roll in your mouth, so we were forced to eat each in 2 bites which sucks because you cant enjoy the flavors simultaneously. Additionally, the amount of salmon in the roll was what I would expect for a roll half the size. I think the theory behind the roll was great, but the execution was slipshod at best.   The tuna sashimi was OK. It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful and I probably wouldn't buy it again. The same could be said for the rainbow roll. It wasnt horrible, but with the exception of the salmon, the other fish was not that flavorful.   After we finished our sushi, we waited about 10 minutes before the waitress came with the desert menu, which is ridiculous imho. Nonetheless, the options were explained and we ended up ordering a slice of chocolate cake to split. It was a HUGE slice, and we were glad we decided to only get one dessert to split. The cake was pretty good. It was moist, chocolatety and warm, a tad sweet for my liking, but my friends didn't think so. It was a nice end to the meal.   Overall, I give Sushi Rock an A-OK 3. The food, while not spectacular, was good. I left full and moderately satisfied. My advice would be: (1) pass on the large rolls...theyre just regular rolls with extra rice and (2) This is probably not the place to go if you want to have any kind of a conversation."}
{"text":"Sushi quality is really questionable. With the combination of seeing flies flying around and seeing black specks on my sushi it totally ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"it was ok...nothing special...the fish didn't taste like the freshest...I guess I'm spoiled living in Southern California though...so it's really hard to compare This place might be great for people who like to order rolls rather than nigiri..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money at such trashy place. They are literally so rude and disrespectful, there are other nice and warm place to stay, go there!"}
{"text":"I went here on a recent trip to Cleveland and though the sushi was decent. However, the dim, modern interior and great service make me want to give it 4 stars.  The edamame we started with was a bit too salty. We ordered the Dragon roll (unagi) and the Rock and Roll (shrimp tempura). The unagi was great and had lots of flavored. The other shrimp tempura was ok; the shrimp was a big soggy, as if they fried it too long ago. They have real Japanese chefs rolling the sushi so that's always a plus.  Street parking was available in the front."}
{"text":"You know what? I really dislike Sushi Rock. Overpriced for abysmal sushi. Servers and hosts who always have a holier-than-thou attitude. Atmosphere that is just trying a tad too hard to be cool. Every once in a blue moon someone invites me to Sushi Rock, and I promptly says \"ew, why?\". Please save your money and  go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"A very solid sushi joint. Randomly walked in late one night for dinner. First time I've tried brown rice instead of white rice with my order. That option knocks this place to a 4 star.. I ordered the Kamikaze roll and spicy dynamite roll. Both had some kick to then, but the flavour was there. Seaweed salad was on point and the spicy salmon, although not the best I've had, was still respectable. Service was a little slow, but food came out fast once we placed our order. Would definitely return to try some other rolls. Price was pretty sushi-standard."}
{"text":"At one time, Sushi Rock was the place to go to for sushi in the Yonge/Eglinton area. However, it's not that way any longer. Three of us went for dinner and paid more than $80 for two bento boxes, some soup, sushi roll, and two drinks. The food was good, but not great. The service was good, but a bit slow. If I were back in the area, I'd definitely explore other options. I've been to quite a few other sushi places throughout the city and there are better options out there."}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant wanting to try one of the many good and interesting restaurants in the Yonge and Eglinton area. It was dinner-time on a Saturday evening and there were only two tables occupied apart from our own. We were quickly seated by the staff who barely spoke more than a few words to us.  Miso Soup ($1.50): Like the rest of the food, arrived cold. Did not have very much taste.  Garden Salad: Didn't order it, but came for free alongside miso soup- unsure if this was intentional or not. Drenched in a sweet miso dressing, which on its own tasted quite pleasant, but was so excessive that whatever flavour the lettuce and cucumber would have had was overwhelmed and impossible to recognize.  BBQ Eel Appetizer ($7.49): Six very small pieces of BBQ eel with a good amount of sauce. Again the fish was cold, as if left out for a while before being served. Nice presentation. Very little bang for your buck.  Rock Roll ($9): Roll was cold and mushy. Cream cheese overwhelmed all the other flavours to the point of them only adding texture. Wasn't fresh.  Lychee Martgarita ($6.50): Staff seemed very uncertain when I ordered it, I witnessed and heard a few scrambling around asking each other questions, as if no one had ever ordered it before. Was very watered down. Poorly crushed ice with large chunks floated atop a watered down somewhat lychee-tasting liquid. Came in a small martini glass that would have been acceptable if not for the terrible quality of the drink. Very overpriced.  For the first time in years I was unable to force myself to finish the food I had paid for.  While quick, the service was very indifferent to us- they barely spoke. The dishes were all cold, not fresh, and overpriced. It was as if no effort had been put into any aspect of the restaurant- the food, the menu, the decor, the service. A major disappointment."}
{"text":"So I'm usually wary of any sushi place that looks more like Starbucks than an actual Japanese restaurant, but if you're craving sushi, go here on Thursday nights.  From 5-10 pm they have half off of their nigri, maki, and hand roll sushi.  The quality is ok, and you're limited to a special Thursday night menu if you go for the half off deal, but you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"This is a great place close to Yonge and Eglinton. They have very yummy sushi and Takara plum wine. I have been going there for about 2 years and I absolutely love it. It is not the best sushi place I have been to but it's worth to try. And the prices are good enough too. And yes - they have the best Plum wine I have ever tried - Takara Plum wine, thats a must to try if you like sweet vines (its actually not too sweet and thats why I love it)."}
{"text":"The dragon on fire roll is great, a hot (torched) sushi roll served in a bed of sauce. Everything else is pretty average. The kani salad is a large chunk of imitation crab covered in japanese mayo on a small bed of greens. The salmon sashimi comes apart easily when you lift it with your chopsticks. The black pearl roll had too much tempura shrimp filling on the inside and the rolls in general have a lot of rice.  WiFi password is 4164833888"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh, high-quality sushi.  When you're here you'll truly see why sushi is as much an art as a food.  The Big Rock Rolls are great.  I love the Pretty Woman (smoked salmon, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese, kiwi) and Rock & Roll (shrimp tempura, crabstick, avocado, cucumber).  This is definitely one of the higher-end sushi places in the Cleveland area, and although it is more expensive than related establishments, it delivers in quality.  The Jasmine tea is excellent and they'll keep pouring you more and more the whole night.  On busy nights the service is so-so (especially half-priced sushi Wednesday).  But overall, the waiters are helpful and laid-back.  There are several spots by the sushi bar for those interested in watching the sushi chefs perfect their craft.  The ambiance is good, although it can be noisy at times, especially later at night.  There's extra seating upstairs and a giant screen that usually projects local sporting events towards the front.  Altogether, one of the more reasonably priced establishments in the Warehouse District.  On weekday afternoons you should be able to find a place out front on the street to park, and on weekends there's plenty of parking lots in the surrounding area.  Expect a decent, but reasonable, wait at peak times (Wednesday/weekend nights)."}
{"text":"Wednesday is \"Tsunami Night\" and an absolute must! All the Sushi and Maki rolls are half off; you just can't beat that!  I'm no sushi expert but I split a plethora of different rolls with a friend of which each and every bite delivered nothing but absolute satisfaction. I was full after two rolls but couldn't stop myself from eating more.  The service was exceptional and extremely efficient.   Note: You will probably want to make a reservation as it can get pretty busy and the restaurant is not all that big to begin with."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here on 02.15.2010 after hearing the WMMS DJ's talk this place up.  The restaurant was definitely nice and swanky.  The \"SR\" waterfall sign had me mesmerized like a little kid.  We ordered Miso soup and 3 kinds of sushi (Lobster California roll, the Sushi Rock roll,  and the Big Mouth roll).  After ordering, we realized they were all cooked rolls, and none were raw, but that's ok because they all sounded good.  The rolls were *just* OK.  They were definitely not worth the 45 minute drive to Beachwood, nor were they worth the $50 dinning bill (and those were the *lunch prices*).  At dinner time, a 10oz Filet Mignon here costs $40!  I've had much better, and much less expensive sushi elsewhere.  For my money, there is no sushi better than KOI (Las Vegas, Hollywood, or NY).  Letter grade:  D+"}
{"text":"God for the half price night and order some calamari. Other than that there is way better sushi around this part of town."}
{"text":"Pricy and sushi taste pretty plain."}
{"text":"Very expensive but great atmosphere for younger people! Great night out! Dress nice and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Love having a great sushi spot right in my walking area, I tried Sushi Rock today as a blind run. The service was almost too good (thought they were going to propose marriage) and my water glass never got less than 3 sips low. They had sufficient clients to avoid me but didn't and that was impressive. I ordered a cup of miso, chicken teryiaki (white people chicken) lol  and the Gold Dragon roll,  just perfection and I will definetly be back eh"}
{"text":"Great sushi place to try in the Yonge/Eglinton area. Service was amazing. Our waitress was able to remember everything and very attentive and patient with our group.   I ordered the..  Edamame with salt - It could have more salt imho.  Rock Roll (Shrimp and salmon tempura, avocado, cucumber and cream cheese), this was delicious and I was definitely full. You can change the white rice to brown which was nice.  BBQ Eel Rolls - A bit small but super tasty  It seemed very clean inside. However, there were a lot of flies at the restaurant. It was annoying trying to shoo them away while having dinner."}
{"text":"Don't know why, but it's a popular place for my friends and colleagues.  It's alright, some things on the menu are good. I prefer not to go with their bento's and choose of the regular menu. Their age dashe is interesting, their steak tar tare (which is just new york strips in soy sauce and green onions) is really good, but their baked sushi's in spicy mayo sauce is puke worthy (dragon on fire).   Go if you want, you won't want those minutes of your life back, but you won't remember them either."}
{"text":"The best place for take out sushi that we have found in the area. Simple sushi that is fresh, great chicken fried rice...The delivery is super quick and they always keep the hot stuff separate from the sushi which keeps everything fresh when you get it."}
{"text":"Ugh! Avoid!  Place is expensive, loud and is crawling with some of the stupidest people I've ever encountered.  You will NOT be able to have a date at this place: it's like a poor attempt at a night club while serving Sushi procured from a gas station.  And that's if you walk into the place.  I worked in the same building and the staff would try to \"trade\" sushi for some of our product.  At first, we were excited...after sending several expensive specialty items to their staff, over an hour later we were given two (2) horribly made California rolls.  They weren't even sliced into pieces.  We threw them into the trash and refused to \"trade\" again. Even when we went out of our way to establish a friendly rapport, their \"thank you\" sushi was a clear \"f#%^ you, suckers!\""}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Beachwood Sushi Rock and although I satisfied my Spicy Tuna Roll craving, I was still walking out slightly unimpressed.  I really can't put my finger on exactly why, but a few mentionables are this.  1) The barstools are brutal.  Granted I'm 6'1 and 200lbs, but for a place to provide a one cheek seat at the bar is wrong!!  Really not that comfortable at all.  I considered moving to a table.  2) The bartender only offered water, didn't ask us for drinks or even try to sell us a glass of wine.  Isn't the #1 rule for a bartender is to push the drinks?  3) The food seemed mid-week fresh.  Salmon was a little more gamey then usual and the deep fried shrimp was chewey.  I decided not to eat the tails but only had chopsticks to remove the shell portion.  Downtown they give you the silverware option without even asking.  At least they did for us last time we were there.  It might have been that the bartender downtown assumed that we had no knowledge on the use of chopsticks.  If this was here defense, she is about 60% right....ha ha.  Now there was about 2 tables with people at them and one other person at the bar at 3:30ish when we went so that's understandable.  The bartender herself was nice, cute, helpful, and gave great recommendations.  I do think that she should study the sushi menu a little more and know what the ingredients are but maybe that's why she's the day girl.  I do like the layout, its wide open but does allow a little privacy in certain areas of the restaurant.  Prices were a little expensive but it is Beachwood after all.  We did only go in for one roll and got two, but we left still a little hungry so we hit McCormick and Schmicks for their wonderful 3:30-6pm happy hour for clams, wings, and nachos.  I'd go again, might even bring friends for a weekend snack, but we would probably go more for then ambiance then the food.  Sushi grade is probably B-."}
{"text":"Not so much.  I was thoroughly underwhelmed with my visit to Sushi Rock. I had heard such great things about it, I thought it would be awesome, but alas, it was nothing close. I realize now that what most people rave about is the half-price night. Ok great, but after our meal there, I am not even enticed enough by half-price sushi to go back.  The ambiance - well there isn't any. It was too open, too generic, blah.   The food - the sushi wasn't really gross or anything, it just was totally unremarkable.   The price - WAY overpriced for an experience that was just average.   I guess if somebody wants to go there and it's half-price night, go ahead and do it but never if you have another option or of your own accord.   ."}
{"text":"I came here on one of  my first days in Champaign, and I've been back several times since. The service has always been pretty good. I've only eaten there for lunch, and I like the deal with two rolls and a bowl of udon. To me, it's a lot of food for 8.99.   I'm no sushi or udon expert, but I do think they taste really good, especially the udon. Nothing better than to slurp up the noodles on a cold winter's day. The main reason this place didn't get four stars was that I don't like the atmosphere. It's a little cramped. I don't like to feel like I'm sitting on top of my fellow diners. Also, they play Top 40 stuff, which isn't all that appealing to me. I guess they're going for a young feel, but I don't wanna hear that stuff all the time when I'm eating. I guess that makes me old and crotchety."}
{"text":"When I get the itch for some maki, it's one that I have to scratch.  With Sushi Rock just around the corner from me right now, I decided to check the joint out.    The restaurant has a very sophisticated, lounge-y atmosphere, with tall ceilings, dark but simple decorating and furniture, and soft, unobtrusive music playing.  I was seated in the restaurant side of the space, which also houses the sushi bar.  The other side seemed to be a bar with alcoholic drinks served.  It was a good fit for my mood today; sometimes I like to eat in a local, bento-box sized restaurant with faux fusuma, but today I needed some elbow room, and this fit the bill.    I started out my meal with my appetizer staple, Miso soup.  It was pricier than most places at $4 (I usually pay $2, even at restaurants where the rolls are more expensive than they were here).  It was a good sized portion and tasted fresh.  The tofu was also just the right consistency - not too soggy, and not crunchy in the middle like it came from some box like a crouton.    I ordered a very American roll this time, Philadelphia.  I was pretty impressed!  Everything tasted extremely fresh, and the entire roll stayed together when I soaked it in soy sauce before taking a bite.  The pickled ginger that accompanied was also very crisp and fresh tasting, not slimy and over-pickled like it can become at some places.    The service was prompt, and my server was very friendly, helpful, and attentive (but not too much).  I tipped him generously, as I had appreciated both the service and the break it had provided me in the day when I needed it.    Definitely a place I will be returning to, and one I would recommend going to if you're craving sushi in the Beachwood area!"}
{"text":"In town for a business meeting and wanted sushi.  A quick walk from the hotel.  It was a quite Thursday night so I practically had the place to myself.  The choices were plenty and when I asked if they could make a Christmas Tree roll, the chef did not hesitate.  It was very good.  I enjoyed the Rainbow roll also.  The waitress was very helpful in  suggesting some of Sushi Rock's special rolls.  Definetly will visit when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Good food. Not the best sushi in the world but it gets the job done, especially during half-price sushi (Tsunami night). One bad thing about this place is that lack of lighting at tables upstairs. I know it is suppose to be dark but could you at-least add another light or something so that we can actually read the menus? Also, get a reservation for Tsunami night as you will need it."}
{"text":"So this young lady wants a hot date as SR. Loud music, everyone is chatting...the place is ALIVE!! our meal was great! A little cramped in non booth area but better than DT location. Highly recommend going here to get a nice healthy full stomach off a big roll. Calamari is Banging!!!! Oh yes in deedy, a favorite off the bat. Nice and soft through that oriental glazed flavor of spice. mmmm....check it out on Tsunami night....half off selected dishes!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is not bad, but not great. Service is also up to par. Sushi rock pails in comparison, however, to nearby restaurants, that have much better quality sushi, and hover around the same price. Though I may come here again for Korean food, I will not be returning for sushi."}
{"text":"I had pretty high hopes for Sushi Rock, but it didn't really live up to the hype.  The food was fine and the prices were acceptable, but the service left a lot to be desired.  We were a table of 5 and the restaurant wasn't too busy when we were there on a Tuesday night.  However, for some reason it took them eons to serve us our food.  What's worse is that everyone's meals arrived at staggered times, meaning that the first person to finally receive food was made to guiltily enjoy each morsel as his ravenous friends looked on with envy.  There was a gap of about 20 minutes from the arrival of the first dinner to the last, it was ridiculous. Sushi Rock should recognize that when people come to eat dinner together, they'd like to all be consuming said dinner at approximately the same time."}
{"text":"This is your average sushi place. Sushi rolls can go anywhere from $4 to $9 and they're of fairly average quality. I ended up getting a lunch special with two rolls of sushi with miso soup. The pre-made miso soup is poured into a bowl, and then they take tofu squares from some sort of refrigerator and drop them into the soup; I found that odd. The service was pretty friendly too.  The bento boxes can be underwhelming at times. For instance, I ordered a bulgogi bento box and I got more onions than bulgogi in it."}
{"text":"The service is awful.  God forbid anyone smile it is no wonder the downtown one closed so abruptly. The skirts the hostess wear are inappropriate , actually watched one have a waitress check her's out because it was so short. ."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, among the sushi places I've gone to in Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Miami, LA and San Francisco, this random little place in nowheresville Ohio was really  quite good!  They had very progressive sushi dishes, even back in 2002, when sushi was just becoming ubiquitous.  This is a very fun place with the right vibe to it.  Cleveland is not recognized enough for all of its charm (Rock and Roll museum, Cleveland Browns), but restaurants like Sushi Rock help make Cleveland more memorable.  I really recommend this place - it's like Cleveland's own version of a very good Sushi Samba."}
{"text":"Average sushi.  Nothing special.  HORRIBLE SERVICE.  Uncomfortable chairs and décor.  Loud as hell in there.  Awful.  But half price every Thursday.  I guess for half off its a little more worth it.  Still a horrible horrible place."}
{"text":"I came here recently for dinner. I ordered the Spicy Tuna Combo which includes 2 tuna sushi, 2 salmon sushi, 8 spicy tuna roll. That tuna roll was not spicy! The restaurant is a large narrow room which was not busy on a Friday night. Perhaps I had missed the early dinner crowd?  Having said that, the service was fast and efficient. I can't complain but I will not be trading my regular sushi joint for this one."}
{"text":"I got the sunset roll $8.99 (salmon and crab) and the tuna avocado roll (w/ spicy tuna) $7.50. Both were pretty good, each roll was 6 small pieces. The place is pretty trendy, all the servers and chefs were pretty young. I ordered it to go, so I can't really say how the waiter service was, but the bartender was nice and they made my sushi pretty quickly. For most of the places i've eaten around here, I rather like this place, since the prices are reasonable and the food was really good (and I eat sushi ALOT). I'll definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"This was a tough one to score.  I'm going to sound like a snob, but here it goes: I come from Orange County, where we are spoiled - where there are myriad sushi places to try. If you're feeling a little hungry and you're low on cash, you've got You and I sushi. If you're up for spending a little more, you've got Zenko. If you're feeling like just a normal roll, you've got Yen...Tenkos...Feeling like a baller? You've got Kitayama. Feel like spending $30 on a chirashi bowl for lunch? You've got Ohshima in Anaheim. I think I've become a sushi snob...  OK, I'm rambling. Let's get to the point:  Food:  Quality - 3 Taste - 4 Price - 3 (pretty typical prices, their menu is on their website) I ended up spending $60 for lunch for two (including a generous tip, due to Stewart). If you're used to eating good sushi, don't expect great quality here. The taste is not bad, but you don't really taste the fish. You taste the sauce. If you like that, great! If you're like me, you'll want to taste the fish more...maybe they are trying to hide the freshness (or lack thereof)?   Ambiance - 5 Hip environment, music is good. Good place for a date, plus it's only about a 15 minute walk from the stadium/Rock n Roll HOF.  Service - 5 The lady and I sat at the sushi bar. First thing I noticed - no Asian sushi chefs. We had one white guy (Stewart? Stuart?) and 2 Hispanic gentlemen. We looked at them, they looked at us, we looked at the menu. Stewart said \"hi\" and asked how we were doing. I let him know we were fine. Our server took a little while to ask us for our drinks and to bring our menus, and we were in a hurry, so that wasn't too cool. It was okay because he had a cool Aussie accent.   We ordered the following: yellowtail jalapeno appetizer, a Sushi Rock roll, and a Golden Dragon roll. Stewart started making the yellowtail jalapeno appetizer right away. Then came the other two rolls (Sushi Rock roll and Golden Dragon roll). They were okay. Then came the Cobra roll. The lady and I exchanged confused looks and hesitantly took the plate.    \"Did we order this?\" \"Cobra roll, on the house,\" says Stewart. \"It came out about two weeks ago.\"  Instantly my attitude changed. I opened up. Stewart (I'm sorry if I'm mispelling your name) was cutting a frozen slab of something. I asked him what it was, he was friendly and explained that it was tuna from Japan, and told us some cool stuff about it - how it's $60/lb, how it goes bad after 30 min, how he throws 2 slabs away every week. He took the time to educate us and break the ice. Respectable, I appreciated it every bit. He told us how he started at Benihana, his dreams of opening a restaurant, how six years ago his doctor told him to stop being a sushi chef because of his allergic reactions, how people paid him to swallow a wad of wasabi, how he loves his Siracha sauce. We asked him how he got into making sushi. His response: \"I love making it.\"  We were in a hurry to catch the 2:30 showing of U23D at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (which is fabulous, by the way). I asked our server for the check, and he did some stuff before coming back with it. If he was a little faster overall, we could have maybe gotten to the show on time. We ended up getting there a little late, but I was a happy camper. He had a cool accent, and Stewart made my day. He was probably going to throw the fish away anyway, but props for giving it to us.  You know, Stewart, I love your passion to make sushi. And even though the taste and quality doesn't rank among the highest in my book, I admire you pursuing your passion, and your love for the art. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Rock a few times and the service has deteriorated, as has the food.  We went to a late lunch, early dinner at 4pm.  We were the only customers.  Service at first was okay but we ordered and she came back four times to ask us what we ordered and questions about what we had ordered.  Once we had gotten our food we had to bring to her attention that she forgot one meal...she hadn't rung it up.  A lot of forgetting.  The food:  The sushi was okay but contained about three times as much rice as sushi normally does.  The big rolls are seriously three bites of food that are next to impossible to stick in your mouth all at once.  I order the Geisha roll with the sweet sauce on the side.  My reasoning being I don't like sweet with dinner, I wanted spicy.  I am so glad I did because the sauce reminded me of spaghettio sauce.  Ew.  I also ordered a spicy tuna roll, my complain is only that it had too much rice.  Also shared edamame which was fine and miso soup with was really good.  My sister also always gets the Sushi rock shrimp and it is always so good, just fried.    Lastly, more service woes....I asked for more water (when I truly believe you should never have to ask for more water) and she filled my completely empty glass with room temperature water, no ice.  Seriously?  At this point there was still more staff than customers so I don't understand.  Our waitress seemed to be bartender and waitress to the whole restaurant and she wasn't handling it very well.  I thought the sushi was reasonable at $13 for the big roll and about $7 for the spicy tuna but others I was with called this \"big city pricing.\""}
{"text":"This is by far the worst sushi place I have been too. The service was horrible, we had to wait 30 minutes after we were finished eating to get our check then another 30 minutes to get our cards back. The sushi was bland due to the sushi rice not being prepared the right way. We asked about the sushi rice not being made with rice vinegar and the guy we talked to said that the steamed rice probably got mixed up with the sushi rice and that was all we heard. No manager came over to apologize for the horrible food and horrible service. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BAD FOOD AND BAD SERVICE."}
{"text":"Trendy sushi restaurant. The quality of sushi is decent (really not as bad as some people are saying). Their rolls are ok as well. Really nothing special about the place except for its trendy interior.  Traffic can get bad around here during rush hour so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Rock & I hate Sushi Rock.   Let me explain, occasionally you will go in and get great fresh satisfying food. I always get calamari and the Razorback Roll and the rest I leave up to my mood. Then sometimes, like yesterday, I went for lunch and received pretty raunchy calamari that tasted nothing like it did a few weeks ago. You can tell that they change the chefs on certain days. It's either great or it's awful. It was so awful we ended up not even ordering sushi. The service is also pretty slow and everything takes so long.   Take-out is also a huge disappointment and they have messed up our order more than once.  Cleveland is obviously not the epitome of great sushi so I can't judge the place too harshly."}
{"text":"Sushi is fantastic for the price, which is very reasonable for the neighbourhood, service is great, portions are large and the selection is fantastic! They are great with kids and very flexible about menu substitutions. Try some specials instead of the all-you-can-eat, I recommend the torched sushi!"}
{"text":"Went for half-price sushi on a Wednesday. It was just okay. The decor is very modern/nightclub, and the place seemed to be very popular with young professionals. I'm not sure I was feeling the loud club music on a Wednesday evening, but others might enjoy it. Very average sushi, but the prices were obviously great."}
{"text":"Nice surprise. Excellent food and service. Prices are good.  Recommend highly over other places in town. My wife says the Udon soup was the best she's ever had. That's saying something. Plus, it's in the middle of U of I Green Street zone."}
{"text":"Terrible. Never go here. The avocado on the roll was spotted brown and disgusting. If they will serve old avocado- think about the fish!!! I ordered the seared tuna and was asked how I wanted it cooked? Seared? But I said medium rare and it came completely cooked through like low grade tuna. Sent it back and the waitress was really rude about it. I eat seared ahi tuna all the time and even chain restaurants can do it better. I make better at home. She acted like I didn't know about tuna and that it doesn't cook like 'meat'. Which is why you shouldn't over cook it unless someone asks! Medium rare should be *at the very least*a little pink in the middle. I told her not to resend it. For $24, what a rip. The tuna was the size of two fingers and came with a 'side'- we chose fries since they sounded good 'Parmesan truffle'. The fries were a joke. A little bit of salt on a frozen fry. No truffle, no Parmesan. Not even the flavors from a bottle.   The sushi roll would have been good minus the obviously spotted and brown avocado on the top- for $12, no thank you. An avocado on a roll costs mere cents when it is slim shaved on top- you couldn't cut a fresh one or say you didn't have fresh avocado?  Note when a sushi restaurant has more than half the sushi as cooked! And that includes tuna as an ingredient. Cooked tuna in a signature roll? For $14+?  Had the Greek-like 'salad'- maybe they should mention no lettuce in the salad? Odd to have a Greek salad at a sushi place but I always love a good Greek salad. Get it if you like mushy, pink tomatoes.  After returning the tuna entree, not being asked if I wanted something else, and no follow up by management- I will never return here.  I'm only sorry I didn't take pictures so you wouldn't waste a cent here. No wonder there were a handful of people here on a Friday night.  Sad- we went to the downtown location on one of our first dates years ago and loved it. Really sad to leave so hungry and disappointed. I hate to be so mean, but this was not a cheap, disappointing meal. It was pricey and we had one app, two rolls, a side salad and (not consumed) entree for three  people. We thought we would order another round of sushi after the first but once you see the unpalatable avocado- you realize it might be best to go through the drive through in the way home. I'm sorry but that is outrageous!"}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere in Cleveland - the sushi isn't the most earth shattering sushi in the world (I do live in Chicago and have aweeeeesome sushi regularly), but a fantastic place for gathering and the rolls are pretty yummy!  Service as just OK on the 3 separate occassions I have been at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi here was alright. It semi-fulfilled my sushi cravings but I wouldnt come back here again.  I'm from the west coast so my expectations for sushi is a little different. I've yet to find a good sushi place (although I know there is a Miku here now, so I'll be trying that soon and hoping for some west coast flavour).  I came here on a Friday afternoon. It was busy enough but the service was good. My coworker and I had a sushi combo each and had 2 nigiris each and the bill came out to be almost $50. I think it was not worth more than $30.  This place is out of my way but we happened to be in the area for best buy across the street, so I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I was about to give Sushi Rock three stars. But, due to the ambiance, the company, as well as just the overall great time I had there, I give it four stars.  I love the set up of this place. After I parked randomly in front of the Pinnacle around the corner of Sushi Rock on W. 6th (some places in Cleveland I wonder, at times, if it's okay to park there), I went to meet my co-workers for some mid-week night sushi.  When I walked in, I was greeted by definitely a cool vibe- working professionals everywhere, and there was a DJ. Yes, a DJ. How strange... I was expecting a Japanese restaurant. We were led up the stairs to this spacious second floor- one side being a bright room full of tables, the other side full of booths, with dark lighting. We were led to the latter.  Since it was half-off Wednesday (yes!), we decided to start off with appetizers. The calamari had a great sweet and sour sauce over it. Mmm. Definitely good. My friend ordered the kobe steak appetizer as well- the kobe steak was cooked perfectly- just the random veggies they had off to the size. Here, the kobe steak was marinated in some type of sesame, soy sauce, something marinade...and the veggies off to the side had some mayo-creamy dressing. Weird weird combo.   We ordered the sushi. I think, overall, the grade was okay. I wasn't a fan of how big the rolls were, in terms of ability to stuff into your mouth. I want my sushi in one bite, thank you very much. My mouth couldn't expand wide enough to fit Sushi Rock's sushi. We ordered one of my co-workers favorite- the Big Mouth. There was a tad too much spicy mayo on it, over drenching the tuna and masago, but still good. The others were pretty good as well- surf clam, eel, salmon, etcera. A little small in quantity, but still good.  We had some fun with the sake as well. Kind of wish they had more flavors, but they had a pretty good selection- for Cleveland, that is.  One of my co-workers randomly ordered the chocolate cake at the end. It was gigantic. Beyond gigantic... huge. It was a tad too sweet and dense (could have been moist-er), but kind of funny to have at a Japanese restaurant.  Overall, the food was ok, but the ambiance was so worth it. The DJ was playing up R&B classics from the 90s, and bopping along to the music while enjoying dinner after a long day of work was definitely a good time....."}
{"text":"I ordered salmon avocado roll with spicy mayo on the SIDE and instead got my sushi COMPLETELY smothered with a bucket of gross watery spicy mayo. Pretty much paid 14 bucks for inedible soggy sushi"}
{"text":"Ive been here two times both times the place was not impressive. First time the sushi tasted bad and bland and they didnt fill my water up the whole time. The second time I ordered chicken teriyaki, I thought this would be a cant go wrong dish. Wrong, it had fillers in the chicken plate such as onions and carrots. The chicken didnt even taste like teriyaki. The bento boxes are reasonable but the food is subpar. I think you should stay away from this place because of bad food, subpar waitressing and expensive pricing for what you get. I hope they improve because the food is not great nor even appetizing."}
{"text":"Really mediocre. One waitress was really nice who was on the shorter side.  However, the other one who is taller than the rest of them, she was really really rude. NO smiles, and a look a frustration when we weren't ready with what we wanted to order, everytime we needed a server even if she was right beside us, she would pretend she didnt see us when we would be waving our hands and she would walk to the other side of the restaurant when the restaurant wasn't busy yet. I think their thing there is to ignore their clients by pretending they dont see us waving or trying to make eye contact. its extremely bad.  i found a bug in my water glass and kept trying to wave down a server..  and MANY waitresses just pretended not to see (they were within 2 feet of our table). so I WALKED up to them and informed them of the bug in the glass and asked them to switch the water.   their veggie roll was  very good with shitake mushrooms inside. General tao chicken here was surprisingly good. the pan fried noodles were just sweet and not flavorful and made of shanghainese noodles...nothing japanese about them. the other rolls were ok. nothing that amazing about this place and since the service was so lacking, i don't think i will be going back."}
{"text":"Deep red lights, modern decor, decent sushi and a large drink menu. I've been several times and though the items are consistent I can't say that anything strikes me as being delicious or earning a rating higher than an A-OK. Average price for the specialty rolls is $13 but they all taste a lot a like - cream cheese, lots with tempura, tuna or crab. I'd love to try something that you bite into here and say \"wow, that was amazing sushi\". Miso soup is decent and the salad portions are gigantic.  I prefer the downtown location to Beachwood. If I am heading to the suburban location I prefer the lunch menu to the smaller dinner menu (bento box options at lunch offer a bit more variety)."}
{"text":"I was an avid fan of this location three years ago when I lived in the city.  This weekend I decided to return to have my favorite meal and was very disappointed in the service and well as food quality.  The staff greeted us with great enthusiasm.  However,the staff at the bar was very Luke warm and hesitate to provide any level of professional service or support.  I understand they closed their location downtown Cleveland  And I summize they are heading hat way if this location continues to provide sub-par service."}
{"text":"sushi rock is a relatively genuine Japanese style restaurant in Champaign. Great curry and sushi here. A little expensive for students. Usually 15d per person. Good service but a usually it takes over 15 min to get your food."}
{"text":"We had a friend visiting from out of town a few weekends ago who wanted a good steak and sushi.  We aren't huge sushi fans, though we have eaten at Sushi Rock a few times (and have heard pretty good things about their steaks) so we decided this was a cool, fun place to take someone from out of town.  Wrong-o!    I made reservations on Open Table and requested to sit upstairs.  I think the vibe is a little cooler and less club-y upstairs, so figure it will be perfect.  We show up and it's so loud that the hostess asks me to repeat the last name at least 4 times.  I eventually give up and spell it (It has 4 letters!! And is not unusual in any way!) and she confirms that we still want upstairs.  Yes, awesome, we do.  Except, little did I know, that they also have a room upstairs that I will call the kinda-looks-like-a-diner-old-people-storage-room that is not contemporary.  It's all beige-y and is playing adult contemporary love jams! Yes, it's streaming totally different music from the rest of the place. It's like we walked into a totally different restaurant.    Our meal was fine. Below average for the prices, but ok. But really!? Why does this room exist, first of all, and secondly, why use it for reservations!"}
{"text":"Some people wanted to come here before a comedy show, so I agreed. Everyone was really into the sushi. I thought it was good too. I didn't feel like it tasted fishy at all. I ordered a salad and also had the beef sushi, which was just pieces of beef tenderloin with rice next to it. It was good though. If someone really wanted to eat sushi and come here, I wouldn't be a stick in the mud and deny that request."}
{"text":"Very good quality food! High diversity as well. The place is small but the service is fine even if full of people. Food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"I feel like Sushi Rock has been in the Yonge/Eglinton neighborhood forever and I don't quite know how to explain this almost inexplicable longevity.  Sushi Rock's food isn't bad, necessarily. It's better than grocery-store sushi but it's also a far cry from some of the better sushi-specific restaurants in the city.  Anyway, we arrived relatively late on a Thursday night and were seated next to an obnoxiously loud table. Not the best start.  We decided to go with the all-you-can-eat menu and began picking a number of different options to try. The food started coming out quickly, and it was all...fine, I guess. It was competent.  (The hand rolls, usually my favorite item to order, were surprisingly terrible, however. I think this can be attributed to the lackluster quality of Sushi Rock's rice, which is far too dense and chewy.)  Service was also just barely adequate, although our waitress forgot to bring one of our items and took a long time taking our order for the second round."}
{"text":"Rolls were average.  We ordered three rolls: Rock and Roll, Yum Yum, and Dragon.  Rolls were large, but there was not a lot of flavor.  We also ordered a chicken and avocado wrap which was FAR better then the rolls.  It was actually quite good. Maybe this is not the place to order rolls?  Service was fine.  I thought our server was nice and did a good job.  I'm glad I had a Groupon because I would have been extremely disappointed if we actually had to pay $60 + tip for what we ordered.  It was nice to try, but we plan to stick with our other two favorite sushi places in NE Ohio instead.  On a side note, the bathrooms smelled HORRIBLE.  I felt like I was in an old gas station when I went to the restroom.  My wife said the ladies room was equally as bad.  I was also a little disturbed that the long booth we sat in looked like it had stuff splattered on it.  I think the place needs a good cleaning.  For the price Sushi Rock expects you to pay, it should be very clean to say the least."}
{"text":"Wow, I am really surprised by the reviews. The critics are right-- SR is not authentic Japanese, rather Korean. However, I don't feel the vague cultural distinction of the restaurant should detract from the quality food.  FOOD:I usually get two items: 1) korokke and 2) sushi. I typically get the korroke, which is a japanese croquette. Living in northern Japan for 11 years, I can say that this korroke is EXACTLY like the korroke I've had in Japan (don't let the korokke websites fool you...the one I had in Japan had no meat in it). It's simply authentic and divine. The sushi is great, though I never get out of my comfort zone-- not because of taste but because of the price. Hey, I'm a college student with bills to pay, alright?  SERVICE: I've dined in and have taken out and the service has been great. The people are friendly and warm If you are taking out and stay there while hey make your food, they offer you water, which is sweet! :)  Overall, I have no complaints. I am a fan and will be dining there again!"}
{"text":"We got there and it wasn't too busy but there was a good wait to be seated because the host was no where to be seen. Apparently she had just went off to fetch someone's to go order. None of the wait staff that saw us standing there paid us any mind.   The waitress was friendly and helpful in making recommendations. The food was fine; the food is why I came here. The atmosphere and music is cool too.  We had a Groupon that paid $25 for - it was for $50. Apparently if you do not spend $50 then you only get $25 off of what you did spend, not just a free meal (not that it said this on the Groupon). So having ordered we were up to $35, so I placed another order making the bill $50.11 and happily using my Groupon."}
{"text":"I wish I had something fun or snarky to say about this place but it's a nice, higher end Sushi restaurant that serves decent sushi.  It's not the best I've ever had, and far from the worst... hence the 3 stars.  I think if you haven't had sushi outside of Ohio, then you'll probably think it's amazing.  The salmon nigiri we had was fresh, the edamame wasn't overcooked, and the other 2 rolls we ordered were pretty good as well.    The wine list isn't overpriced, though I noticed there was a sushi happy hour going on until 7pm but it was only at the bar.  Under normal circumstances I would be happy to sit at the bar, but I was catching up with a friend and didn't want to have my head cocked to one side for a 2 hour conversation.  Give it a go, the only word of warning is that if you sit outside, try not to face the setting sun.  The sun will inevitably be in the gap between their wall and patio overhang and fry your face for a couple hours until it moves haha."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality and portion sizes offered. The grocery store has better sushi in my opinion. The fish was not fresh at all, even had a frozen taste to it. The calamari was tough, over cooked and swimming in sauce. I wish I would have looked up review before going. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It will leave a bad taste in your mouth"}
{"text":"Delivery was on time... but for the price, man is the quality awful. For anyone who has eaten Japanese food before, stay far away from this place... because you've probably developed standards and this will probably fall well below them. This is like the McDonald's of sushi... except way less gratifying and way more pricy."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good.  When you add the sub-par ambiance and the likelihood that you'll be sitting near a group of d-bags, it's not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"So for Cleveland and what I've experienced as far as sushi here, Sushi rock is one of the better places around.  Is it great? Certainly not but it is head and shoulders above most others in the area and certainly beats the lousy supermarket sushi.  The big draw to the Beachwood Location is Thursdays when they have half priced sushi rolls and nigiri.  The large futo maki rolls and sasimi are not half priced but my little trick to get around the sashimi not being half price is to just order two orders, which gets you 4 pieces for the price of 1 regular sashimi which nets you only 3 pieces.  The only thing I do want people to take note of is that for whatever reason the quality of the nigiri is much better on non-half priced nights.  The reason I mention this even though I usually only go on half priced night is that if you don't enjoy your meal but do want to have a good sushi place to go to I'd recommend giving it a second shot on another day.  The one item I'd highly recommend as far as sushi goes is the spicy scallop.  This sushi is excellent and I have yet to find another restaurant that does the scallop like they do.   Futo Maki rolls are also generally good choices too.  I have never eaten off the \"regular\" non sushi menu to know whats good but the calamari makes for a good appetizer and the lobster bisque is also very good."}
{"text":"I went on Wednesday night and the important thing to remember is that is half price night and my experience from the Beachwood Sushi Rock is that the nigiri sushi generally isn't as good on Wednesdays as it is any other day.  Why? I don't know.  So I would say I experienced similar results downtown however I'd say my worst experience at the Beachwood Sushi Rock, which by no means was bad, was still better than this experience downtown.  All the sushi was highly average at best.  The service was ok, not as good as the Beachwood one and to my surprise the restaurant itself was much smaller, or at least it felt that way.  Besides the fact that I live closer to the Beachwood Sushi Rock than the one downtown, I probably wouldn't make plans myself to visit again but I'd go if invited.  That may sound bad but it shouldn't.  Its just that there are so many other better restaurants downtown that while I'm down there I'd rather enjoy one of them then have an average sushi meal at the Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"I went to this place wanting some close-by Japanese food and some sushi. I still don't understand why all sushi places in Campustown offer Korean food too. It seems a little funny to me... Anyways, to the review!  The atmosphere at lunch time was busy but there was plenty of space available for a party of two. We were promptly served and the food came to us relatively quickly.   I ordered the spicy tuna, california rolls, and udon noodle combo, and the veggie yakisoba (enough food for two hungry people). I was not too impressed with the sushi so I do think the better quality sushi can be found elsewhere. However, for the price and it being U of I campustown, I cannot complain. The sushi ingredients were fine but the wrapping job could have been better. I enjoyed the udon noodles which was warm when I received it. It had enough noodles but the best part was the broth. The yakisoba noodles were comparable to noodles that I have had elsewhere like Sushi Kame (but Kame still has better quality). The dish had a great selection of veggies and a proper ratio of noodles and sauce met my high expectations.   I am glad that it is closer than some of the other alternatives like Sushi Avenue which may be a stretch for a one-hour lunch. I gave it a three out of five because of its distance relative to campus and the quality-to-price ratio. If you have more time and are interested in better dining at a higher price, consider some of the other Japanese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always go to Sushi Rock if I happen to be there on a Wednesday night.  Why Wednesdays?  Tsunami Nights, which means half price for a pretty decent selection of rolls and nigiri!!!  Before I begin, I have to warn you that if you decide to go on a Wednesday night make sure you make reservations ahead of time!  Also if you are with a large group, be prepared to wait a LOOONNNGGGGG time for your food to come.  Now, usually it's just my boyfriend and me so we've never waited too long for our food.  I'm starting to learn to control myself, but when rolls are 3 bucks each it becomes hard to constrain myself to not order too much =P  I think for the past we usually order 7 rolls and 4 nigiri, but by the time we get down to the last roll it becomes a struggle to put the last pieces in our mouths.  And that's when we take a brief break of 10 minutes or so, and then charge through the rest. =D  The quality of the sushi is great.  Everything is very fresh and well-prepared.  The seaweed is not soggy, and the rice is cooked just right.  The spicy tuna is not actually spicy, which is a bit disappointing, but I guess for my own good it's probably better this way.  The service has varied.  We've had waiters that are not very attentive to waiters that are just awesome.  Overall there's not really anything for me to complain about though.  One roll that stands out above the rest is definitely the shrimp tempura roll.  A lot of times the shrimp tempura becomes soggy when wrapped inside the roll, but not at Sushi Rock!  It's perfectly crispy and tastes wonderful.  If you happen to be around Cleveland on a Wednesday night, make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Love the Buffet!! Super fresh food and fast service."}
{"text":"Wow, I ordered delivery last night and felt compelled to share so others can order with care or sushi rock can change their ways.  I ordered a bunch of sushi lasts night and it was absolutely disgusting.  I have never had inedible sushi before but this was it.  I couldn't even pick a roll up as it was falling apart in my hands and even eating it regardless, the hard dry flavourless rice and brown mush avocado inside made me have to choke it down.  I gave up soon afterwards.  I did get some apps from there which were delicious (tempura and miso eggplant) but when you order sushi and can't/don't want to finish it, extremely disappointing - you get 1 star sushi rock."}
{"text":"Another ok sushi place. Make sure to go on Wednesday nights, when the sushi is half-off.  The most memorable thing from my experience here were the seating arrangements. There were tables and chairs placed in a very un-rigid and organic way, like they were pieces of coral growing on a reef."}
{"text":"Over time this place has deteriorated to a two star at best. Overall the hostesses seem to be hired based on their dress size and not how they run the \"front of the house\". I did take-out last weekend (not sure why) and finally there was a real person at the hostess desk who was a normal size, engaging, funny and seemed to take her job seriously. Still the sushi was so-so...threw some of it out.  Will probably make the drive to Shuhei next time."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but not good either. Roll selection is humdrum and the ones we ordered lacked flavor. Tasted like fish and rice--there are so many interesting flavors to be had with sushi, and these were not it. We didn't order what appeared to be everyday rolls either, as we tend to be pretty experimental, but these were just not good. Also, does every single roll really need to be garnished with spicy mayo?   A lot to a sushi meal is the presentation--one of our rolls was literally stomach churning to look at--it looked like scrambled eggs on top of an ugly sushi roll. I couldn't keep eating it because it looked so disgusting. This place seriously needs to do some homework on presentation.   Service was similarly unexceptional. Atmosphere is nice, but not enough to make up for the overpriced, boring sushi. Won't be back.   ...Quickly learning that anytime someone from Cleveland raves a restaurant is \"the best (insert food genre) ever!\" it most certainly is not."}
{"text":"My parents asked me to pick a restaurant for dinner while we were passing through Ohio. So I sifted through Yelp for an hour looking for the perfect place. And I found Sushi Rock.   I loved this place because of their giant sushi rolls (eight slices each). We ordered the Sushi Rock roll (amazing!) and the Cobra roll. The Cobra wasn't traditional style sushi--it was soaked in some kind of spicy hot sauce, and was interesting, but not my kind of thing. My mouth was burning and I proceeded to chug two glasses of water afterwards. It was my fault though, I probably should've read the description a little more carefully :-P  But anyway, the quality of the sushi was very good and the prices were appropriate. It would be fun to come here with several people so everyone can order a different roll and then you can all swap! Giddy!  For dessert, we had berries foster. OMG it was the most amazing dessert I have ever ordered at a restaurant save for a kahlua ice cream cake at another place. YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT WHEN YOU EAT AT SUSHI ROCK. Believe me, the world will be a better place.   I would totally go back here if I didn't live in sushi-deprived New England. The fish at our restaurants are either baked or fried, and it slowly kills my soul. At least Cleveland knows the right way to eat fish ;)"}
{"text":"If Cleveland had several more places like this, young people wouldn't be leaving the city in droves. I love going here, especially on Wednesday nights when it's half-price. To be honest, unless you've got some extra money to kill, I wouldn't suggest going here any other night for a full meal because it can get pricey. I went here on a full-priced night and spent quite a bit without even trying or ordering very much at all. I wouldn't suggest coming here on Wednesday nights either without a reservation...just plan a bit ahead and you'll be sure to get a seat!   I'm not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but in my opinion, this place has the best sushi around. I am consistently amazed by the fact that they always manage to get my orders correct and present them in a very professional manner, even on half price night.  I don't know what it is about this place, but I always feel my \"cool\" quotient going up by a power of 10 when I come in here. I kinda like going to places like that. Maybe it's the music, or the lighting, or something else, but in any case, it's a great place to go to chill and enjoy some good sushi in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The sushi here is okay.  It's not awful but it's not spectacular.  We ordered five rolls to share among a group of four.  The rolls were tasty but were not memorable, as I'm looking at the menu now and can't remember what we ordered.  The service was ridiculously poor when we went, which was pretty sad because we were one of possibly five tables in the entire place.  It took twenty minutes to get our water, and then our appetizers came out about three minutes before our rolls.  Our waitress forgot about us quite a few times.  I would go here again if I was invited, but I would not seek it out again on my own."}
{"text":"We visited because we had a Groupon,  and I was really looking forward to this experience!! The ambiance was very nice, the decor and lighting was romantic. We arrived 20 min early for our reservation, so we grabbed sake from the bar and chilled out on cozy little couches until it was time to be seated. Once we were seated, our server took forever to come to us, and when she finally came  she failed to introduce herself. She dropped off my boyfriend's drink and forgot mine. No big deal, I had a water in front of me, and next time she walked by he reminded her, she apologized and quickly brought me one. When the sushi came, the presentation wasn't anything special (Compared to Shinto) and the rolls themselves (Golden Dragon, Yum Yum Roll, and Big Mouth) were mediocre, at best. The Golden Dragon was the exception, it was very tasty!!! However the other two were loaded with rice, so I didn't really taste what was going on inside, and the octopus sashimi was rubbery and not that awesome. I like to use Groupon to try places out and if it were a great experience, I would gladly return and pay full price. Unfortunately I won't be returning Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Above avg sushi, I've had better in Cleveland.  But its worth it on tsunami Thursday when they are half off. The atmosphere on Thursday nights seem trendy and attract a diverse crowd of friendly people. Hard to get a table on Thursday's but if you wait at the bar long enough a seat opens up."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? The food is awful and not fresh. Service is even worse."}
