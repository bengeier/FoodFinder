{"text":"Excellent resto dans Tétreaulville, une surprise indienne agréable ! Très comparable à la rue Jean-Talon, la distance en moins.... Tout est délicieux et généreux dans les portions. Le vin est à prix très raisonnable. La madame du patron m'embrasse à chaque visite....sans rire ! j'invite tous mes amis d'Anjou à passer chez ZIKAA et s'offrir une délicieuse cuisine indienne épicée jamais trop picante! C'est agréable que le français y soit bien parlé....merci! Bientôt, faudra réserver...."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to say this since Zykaa was one of our most favorite restaurant in the area since its opening but I gotta say that after tonight's experience, I highly doubt we'll go back. The food has become incredibly oily (I know Indian food isn't fat free and I can compare with what it used to be): shiny rice that tastes oily, oil puddles on the naan (??), etc. The service has never been quick and it was never a problem for us but tonight, we were there for 2 hours and it took 45 minutes after we were done finishing our food before the dishes were taken away. Our stomaches are definitely not happy with all this oil, even after almost 3 hours and an hour of walking to try to help digestion."}
{"text":"Bonnes portions, prix abordable. Rabais lorsque l'on commande pour emporter. Bon menu diversifié et personnel très courtois"}
{"text":"Meilleur resto indien en ville! Service chaleureux, rapide! Excellent rapport qualité-prix. Nourriture de grande qualité!  Ça vaut le détour."}
{"text":"My husband, my 2 years old son and I went there because I was craving Indian food.  We got there at 5:40 and since they reopened at 5 that is why it was empty. My son started crying because he was starving. We waited 40 mn to get the entrée. Ans it didn't get better after that. The food was good. I had way better butter chicken at India's oven."}
{"text":"Best vindaloo beef I ever tasted-instead of being punched by the heat I could taste every spice individually...delicious! A must try- well worth the drive"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Montreal. We are big fans of Indian cuisine and Zykaa did not disappoint. Service was impeccable and everything offered st the buffet was fantastic. I don't know where else you can find this quality at such a fair price. I felt like I was invited to a home cooked traditional Indian dinner. I highly recommend this little gem!  03/29/2017 Back again. Food even better!"}
{"text":"Gros coup de cur pour ce restaurant indien . Nous avons profiter du buffet du Diner en famille et tout était délicieux."}
{"text":"Worth the detour! The lunch buffet at $10.95 is excellent with an abundance of vegetarian choices as well as the classic butter chicken! Everything I tasted was simply delicious. I would say that the food is not as \"hot\" spicy as I would normally take it but there is a flavourful balance of spices. The food was so good, it was hard to stop eating. Small selection for dessert but by then, there was barely any room left in my stomach. I supposed the dinner options are just as tasty, however, the best bang for the buck would be for the buffet. Restaurant is clean, service courteous and easy to park on the street. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Each time I go to Indian restaurant, I have to save place for my favourite dessert, the gulab Jamun. It is a milk solid based sweet, traditionally made from curdled milk, soaked in a light sugary syrup flavoured with green cardamom and rose water.  I am just addicted to this sweet.  Who starts a review with desserts?   Oops.  I just did.   This family run business does lunch buffet during weekdays.  I dropped in on a Thursday lunch time, and it was busier than I had imagined.   They serve chicken tikka, deep fried chicken, butter chicken, beef masala and a good variety of vegetable dishes like spinach, chicken peas, lentil soup, and of course naan bread, all mildly spiced to accommodate the local clientele.  They also serve hot sauce, to bring the food at par with the traditional indian dishes.   Good service and they take time to go over all the menu and to answer any of your questions.   Of course, I have to finish off with the famous gulab Jamun.  Sooo yummy good!   Very well priced, and your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"The best chicken vindaloo I ever had in my life. If you like a bit spicy, go for it. Or ask them to reduce or order other dishes which is not spicy. The biriyani is more of Pakistani style, we liked it. Also best Skikhanji we ever tried. The owners are in their best behaviors and services. We felt we were at home. In my view this is the best Indian we had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cute little Pakistani restaurant in Montreal. We went there right after spending the morning at the Biodome. The owner was really sweet. The lunch buffet was good, not the best I've ever had but definitely one I would check out again. The place was pretty packed for a Tues afternoon."}
{"text":"This is a gem in the East End !!!  I was sad that my favourite indian restaurant closed in the East, and only had one option that was not recommendable. A friend of mine wanted to try this restaurant, and I saw a 4.5 star review on Yelp and said why not !   We took Combo B since it was a good price value choice.  They were generous in their appetizer size, 3 pakoras+1 samosa each and it was tasty, a tiny tiny bit dry (fritures). The mixed vegetable dish was delicious and flavoursome! The beef curry was really really tasty, I was very surprised. The butter chicken was not as good though, a bit less tasty, but still OK. The spiced tea was a good way to end the meal. (I did not take the desert)  I will go again, since it is a less than 10 minutes drive from my place. They also have take-out and delivery, which can be a good option.  It cost about 25$ tax and tip included / person."}
{"text":"Nous avons très bien mangé ! Bon service ! Prix très raisonnable ! Je vais revenir ! Un des meilleurs restos indiens de Montreal !"}
{"text":"J'en avais beaucoup entendu parler à son ouverture, vu que je fais partie d'un groupe qui zieute pas mal toutes les nouveautés dans mon quartier. Les critiques étaient bonnes, mais comme tout ce qui est nouveau les critiques sont généralement bonnes! Donc, j'ai attendu un peu et me voilà, je l'ai testé aujourd'hui!  Verdict: J'y suis allé à l'heure du midi et j'ai été positivement surpris par ce restaurant! Parce qu'à cette heure, c'est l'heure du buffet, donc je me serais attendu à avoir des restants de la veille et bien non, ce sont tous des plats frais et très bons! Certes, à Montréal, je n'ai toujours pas visité de restaurants Indiens qui la nourriture avait la même intensité qu'en Inde, mais reste qu'il se démarque des autres restaurants Indiens de la ville et mérite d'être positivement parlé.  Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, c'est un petit restaurant! Donc, tout est très local et rien n'est prétentieux. Donc ici, on n'a peut-être pas affaire à un restaurant 5 étoiles, mais nous avons néanmoins affaire à un restaurant qui a son charme. D'autant plus que vu que c'est un buffet, on peut être décontracté, ce qui est un gros plus par rapport aux autres restaurants Indiens à Montréal. Et ce qui est bien aussi, c'est que le serveur n'est pas harcelant malgré le fait qu'il soit très présent et ne laissera jamais votre verre d'eau se vider!  Sommes toutes, par rapport à ses prix, ce restaurant vaut le détour et je vais assurément y retourner!"}
{"text":"Delicious little treasure! Some friends recommended this place and since I love Indian food I had to try it out. We got the popular combo #4 on the menu which has an appetizer and 3 main dishes or so, it's perfect to try a bit of everything. We had the classic samosas, butter chicken, spinach and cheese panzer, chicken tandoori and a beef masala. All the sauces were extended rich and flavourful, the meat was always tender and the portions were just right.   This little restaurant is run by a whole family, it's authentic and friendly.  Despite being in not so pretty neighborhood, it's worth visiting and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Had to come here because of the reviews! If I could I would give it 3 1/2 stars. The location is kinda sketchy since there is a casino located in the next room attached to the restaurant. Interesting people coming in and out of it.. The cutlery and dishes were amazing!  The food was pretty good.  We are from toronto so we have definitely had better indian there.. The biriani rice could have used more flavour. The chicken was juicy and so tastey with just the right amount of spice! Food was not greasy! The owner was so friendly !!"}
