{"text":"A very nice hibachi restaurant that puts on the usual show.  Very substantial portions at a reasonable price.  Sushi is average...though there are a few tasty specialty rolls.  Sushi discount on Mondays. 

PS.  you can buy cheap coupons at restaurant.com...make sure to google  search for discount codes first....you can save up to 80% off already low prices.  (we got a $25 coupon for $2...not $20...$2)"}
{"text":"I and my family came here for sushi but we will not be going back.

It took over two hours for us to get our food and the manager was extremely unsympathetic to our plight.  Their AC was broken that day leaving the restaurant increasingly warm as our wait continued.  The sushi was alright but definitely not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekday. Good sushi, had better, but will definitely go back. Great deal for lunch- 3 rolls, salad, and soup was 10 bucks. Got in and out in an hour. If you work within a short drive, you could totally make it for those days when you are sick of bringing food from home or eating subway!"}
{"text":"Just what the Westside needed.  An authentic Japanese restaurant!  It seems that you need reservations for the \"private\" hibachi room so call ahead if you want the knife juggling show.  Great service, great food.  Definitely not the greatest Japanese restaurant I've ever been too but it's a step in the right direction.  Overall, I was really impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Very Very delicious! Atomsphere is a mix of modern design with the traditional Japanese decor.  There are 2 sides to the restaurant: one with the sushi bar and traditional dining room, the other with hibachi dining tables.  The atmosphere is great with plenty of good sushi and food to pick from.  I enjoyed every roll I ate.  The sushi is very good for Ohio and much better than Sushi Rock!  The rolls are a bit more creative and tasty: you don't need Soy sauce for them TRY BEFORE YOU SATURATE IN SOY SAUCE.  Make sure to check out the volcano, tiger, victoria secret, and ima gastu (not sure of spelling on the last one).  They are a bit more pricer than other sushi places such as Sushi Rock, but the sushi is well worth it.  They also offer you more than other places: 8 big pieces from one of their rolls vs. 6 medium/small pieces from other places.  You can expect to be full with 2.5-3 rolls per a person.  On Mondays they offer 30% on sushi rolls!  On Mondays expect to spend roughly 25-30 per person depending on the gourmet rolls (the more gourmet and unique the higher)  and roughly 10-20 per person with the typical sushi rolls.  Other days be prepared to spend roughly 40-50 on the gourmet rolls and 25-35 on the regular sushi rolls"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place looking for some cheeseburger joint the hotel recommended and I am sooo glad!  Our meal and service was fantastic! We sat at the hibachi grill - I had chicken and shrimp and it was very good.  The soup and salad was perfect.  Everything tasted fresh.  Very pleasant atmosphere and the prices were decent.  Didn't try to sushi but definitely will if we ever make it back."}
{"text":"I went here to have lunch with my Dad on a Saturday afternoon.  It was early and not very crowded, so we decided to sit right at the sushi bar.  Personally, I thought the sushi was great, I'd even go as far to say its the best I've had in the area.  

We got a sashimi sampler to split between us, which was plenty for two people.  At $25-ish the sampler is an exceptionally good deal for sushi of this quality.  I think the one we got had 5 or 6 different types of fish, all of which were very fresh tasting.  The pieces they gave us were also some of the largest I've had in any sushi restaurant.  

The sushi chef behind the bar was very friendly and also gave us a couple extra pieces left over from the other things he was making.  An overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely Japanese restaurant with a beautiful interior. I think Japanese salad dressings are the best anywhere, and the salad here is no exception. The shrimp tempura was good, but, I must say, greasy - I couldn't quite finish it. The udon was good. A nice place."}
{"text":"We visited Asuka with a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate planning to spend about $75-$100 overall.  We were met at the door with a notice saying Asuka no longer honored them.  The hostess didn't greet us so we asked about the certificate.  She scowled at us and said, \"Not again!  You are the fourth person to try to use these!\"  She told us to take it and use it somewhere else.  When we replied that we could not, she rolled her eyes and sighed heavily, saying she would give us $10 off our meal but wouldn't honor our $25 certificate.  We would have eaten there anyway, but she muttered under her breath and walked away from us. The hostess was so rude, abrupt and argumentative that we decided to leave.  

While I understand that sometimes complications arise when a restaurant can no longer honor a gift certificate or discount, one would expect an apology or at least an explanation rather then rudeness and abuse.

EDITED TO ADD:  The purchase date on this gift certificate was November 28, nearly one month *after* Asuka stopped honoring them."}
{"text":"This location was home to Brendan O'Neills for many years.  And looking back I'd have to say I'm glad it was replaced.  In comparison, Asuka is a great sushi spot to have in the area.

Not the best sushi you'll ever have, but still great nevertheless.  The kind of place you go back to because it delivers, and that's what's most important.

The prices are reasonable and the portions are your standard sushi size.  I haven't had the hibachi here, but I imagine it's a little more filling.

The wait staff is always congenial and ready to grab something or refill water or tea.  The sushi selection is wide, although I've seen wider.  They have sweet potato tempura sushi which is always a plus!

The sushi bar is big and there's a flat screen above it, so if you're not watching the sushi chefs you can keep tabs on a local sports game or the news.  There's a private hibachi grill in the back for larger parties.  Overall, the decor is good, with a very spacious feel and Japanese decor.

Westlake hadn't had a sushi place until this one showed up, so for Westsiders it's a great find."}
{"text":"Chicken hibachi was good; soup was terrible.  Salad dressing was also not good.  We both decided to leave the soup and salad untouched.  
Server was mediocre, he never brought me my rice; I had to flag down another staff member.  The server also neglected to bring us a drink menu until the END of our dinner.  The check took forever.  However,  the hibachi man was great!"}
{"text":"The chefs here obviously take pride in their work. Presentation of nigiri and maki rolls is attractive (the ikura is especially pretty). The serving sizes for tempura dinners are very large.  The waitstaff are very friendly, and I am never made to feel neglected just because I come here alone sometimes- I still get a good table. I highly recommend this place."}
