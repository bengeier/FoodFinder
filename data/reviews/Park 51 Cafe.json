{"text":"Breakfast: I really like mom and pop restaurants, especially for breakfast. So, this review is biased. 
Eggs are done correctly.
Bacon is well done, not burned
Hash browns left on flattop too long.
White buttered toast is the best.
Coffee is good. 
Price: really a bargain"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast stop in Charlotte, by far. Park 51 is a little small, but has a great old-school diner feel to it. Their menu is diverse (with a few Greek items for color!) and cheap, whether you're going for breakfast or lunch. The waitresses are friendly, attentive and efficient, and the food comes out fast.

If you're looking for a wholesome southern meal, Park 51 hits the spot!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for traditional southern faire, this is the place for you. No fancy décor. Booths can feel crowded, small. Popular after church hangout. Prices affordable for family. My kids loved it!"}
{"text":"I believe I was the first Yelper to give this place a 5 star review.  I used to love this place and came here every time I came back to Charlotte from the west coast.  However, the last time I ate here back in May, something happened that ensured that I'll never come back.

I ordered calabash shrimp, turnip greens, and coleslaw.  About 5 minutes into my meal, I took a bite of greens and felt something really sharp in my mouth...and pulled out an ~1 inch-long razor sharp grarled piece of metal...I'm pretty sure it was from the can lid the greens came from.  Anyway, had I swallowed it, it would have ripped me up inside.

I told my waitress and the owner.  \"Oh we're so sorry.  Can I bring you something else?\"  My stomach had turned at this point so I said \"no.\"  At this point the brain-dead owner handed me the check and went to the register so I could pay!  

Rather than argue, I figured here's a guy that has seen me in here for over a decade.  All the waitresses know me and stop by and talk.  If he's so freaking stupid to want to charge me for a meal I didn't eat and that was contaminated with a piece of metal that could have sent me to the hospital or worse, I'll pay for the meal and let you guys know to steer clear.

AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't even get to try their food as I was ignored when I entered by I'm guessing the manager or host woman.  I stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest. Then some guests entered behind me and she said hello to them immediately and then looked at me and said, have you been helped yet. I said no and she gave me a menu and told me to seat myself. They were full except one table that the guests behind me quickly claimed. She offered no further help and I offered no further business.  Would've been so simple to just acknowledge me and offer some service."}
{"text":"Consistent diner food with good service. Not winning any awards for creativity or wonderful dishes, but you're guaranteed to get exactly what you ordered."}
{"text":"This little café has a great menu, fantastic prices and the food is surprisingly good.  Fried flounder dinner with fresh vegetables...spinach sautéed perfectly, broccoli steamed and seasoned lightly, okra fried up like Grandmas and tasty cole slaw.  Plus homemade corn bread muffins....For less then $20 for two, you cannot beat it.    Known for their breakfasts but give lunch or dinner a try.  New owners are doing a great job."}
{"text":"That's good coffee.

Had some blueberry pancakes and eggs. Best pancakes ever!"}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST SOUPS AND CASSEROLES!!! Everytime I visit Park 51 I end up with a new favorite plate! Prices are great service is quick, and the staff is always very attentive and ready to assist you!! I am a big Fan and encourage everyone to come out and see for yourself!!  Very Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here.  My first was Christmas time 2014.  If you're looking for a good hearty, filling breakfast this the place.  There can be a wait for seating but worth it.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Good value local no frills spot for breakfast.  Order was not as I asked, but they blamed it on being being busy.  Was a good late breakfast crowd, lots of locals, watched some older folks come in and leave; must have been too busy for them.  We had no wait.   Sausage links greasy, squirted with each bite.  Nothing too fancy and booth needed a good wipe down from earlier rush I guess."}
{"text":"This Hinkle and unassuming place serves and very solid breakfast. Is it sublime? No is the best breakfast? No but it is good meal for a great price. The owners and workers are friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! We just went there for lunch and it was a fantastic dining experience. The homemade vegetable soup was as good as you can get. It was loaded with fresh veggies. every salad dressing is homemade. They put tons of feta cheese on the Greek salads and the Greek dressing is amazing! I had the chicken souvlaki plate and it was so good. The pita bread was locally baked. The other person I was with had the marinated chicken tenders on rice. Once again, muy delicioso!!! The fried squash was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The prices were equally as good. 8.50 for the Chicken plate(it came with a Greek salad, pita bread, and one side of your choice). 7.25 for the marinated chicken tenders(2 sides included). Both meals came with complimentary soup! This was our first time dining there, but we will be eating there again very soon!"}
{"text":"Clearly the ownership has changed yet again. We used to come here all the time, but over the last few months the service has just dropped off a cliff. We had to wait for probably 15 minutes for a cup of coffee. My husband ordered a sandwich with no mayo. That's the only request he had, no mayo. After waiting way too long for being the 2nd of two tables there, of course his sandwich had mayo on it. He was very frustrated after another week of difficult medical treatment, so at that point we have sworn off this place for another 2 years, at least. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Good ol' fashioned diner food with friendly service.  Though they could use better coffee from a local roaster."}
{"text":"We went today for lunch and discovered they recently (8/4/16) received a \"B\" grade after their health inspection which immediately makes me not want to eat there. After looking up their inspection to see what the violations were I find that a lot of them are repeat violations which means I will not be a repeat customer! Sorry Park 51 Cafe but you need to clean it up!"}
{"text":"Little local cafe hidden in the Park 51 shopping center just a few doors down from the Black Lion in Pineville. . 
The menu is home cooking and the food is good. Recently remodeled the restaurant had new management that has proven to be a great improvement to the ole place. 
Newly painted and curtains off the windows has brightened up the place. 
The cook is the owner and he has what it takes . 
From breakfast menu to the dinner menu the food is delicious. 
I usually order from the breakfast menu but tonight I tried the meatloaf . It was delicious!  The hubs had the liver and onions tonight and it was fabulous ! 
We Followed it up with homemade banana pudding. It was delicious! 

Stop by and you'll see what I mean. Booths are comfy and the vibe is relaxed . Service is great and the price is right !"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, so I definitely feel like I can give an honest review. The service is great. Very friendly and sweet lady who runs it.  Also the boy who helps is great too! I've tried many things on the menu, and Ive enjoyed them all. The price is also great! All in all I would say good food,  good service and good prices!!"}
{"text":"So this place seems to search a certain demographic. The food was aweful, everything obviously canned and poured in those plastic bowls and that's it. Terrible. Nothing good to say, so I'll end my review."}
{"text":"Ordered a spinach omelet and got some hot chocolate. It's a good place for breakfast and its cheap. Folks are friendly and the food is decent. That's all that matters really. They used to be open for dinner but apparently that didn't work out too well. I'm glad that there's an alternative to iHop for when I want breakfast when I get off work."}
{"text":"The Man probably the Manager/Owner working the door greeted me as if I were their Favorite new customer.  I noticed the staff knew all the regulars (most everyone there by name) and the place was packed.  After I sat down there were no empty tables left.  The customers who arrived later, were also regulars and knew when the \"lunch crowd\" vanished.  I arrived about 12:45 today.  The place was cleared out by 1:15.  This is one of those places my friends say \"now Boy were going to be the youngest ones in there is that ok with you Boy and you get Free Soup too Boy\"!  Yes I have friends that speak exactly like that!

When ordering Spaghetti and Meat Sauce my waitress told me I had a choice of getting something instead of a Salad (I LOVE when they do this).  I said \"How's the Mac& Cheese\" she said \"it's Baked\"!  I had a feeling this was going to be Great!  It Was! !  !  I'll rate this Macaroni and Cheese 5 yelp stars!

The Spaghetti with Meat sauce was a Tuesday Special and it warmed my Soul and no I did not spill it on my \"Bling, Bling\" (I do not wear bling, nor own any). It warmed my Soul not because it was the special either.  It warmed my Soul because it was so HOT and because it tasted good.  In my world of Pasta and Tomato Based Meat Sauce or Marinara there are high expectations and many disappointments so when i say this one is good I'm giving it more than 3 yelp stars, though under four stars.  Still this Meat Sauce beats a lot of other Meat Sauces including most fancy Charlotte area Italian Restaurants (which unfortunately is not saying much).  The Pasta was the usual for these \"Diners\" overcooked and soaked though the Dish was NOT watery, which is a BIG plus!  The Garlic Bread was good too!

When writing reviews I consider the type of place it is and do not want to compare this type of  \"Diner\" to an Upscale place where you get less food (much less) though usually of a better quality and an equally (sometimes unequally) greater price tag!  I enjoy the taste, quality and overall experience of each.  Each kind of place has the potential of being a romantic experience with combined elements of: company, service, decor and taste of the food, probably anywhere can be something special!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great breakfast! The service is always fast. This place is a great little diner."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast just to try a new place. I had scrambled eggs,pancakes,liver mush & bacon my wife had almost the same except she had hash browns instead of pancakes. The food came out hot and fresh and it was very delicious. Our waitress was a little forgetful though. My wife's meal came with toast and jelly which she never received and her bacon came out only after being reminded. We would go there again to eat. They had baked cookies at the cashier on the way out (I love soft cookies) so I asked what they were and how much? I was told white chocolate chip which I love but these had the Macadamia nuts too which I wasn't told and I can't stand. Lucky they were only $1."}
{"text":"Fox News Channel was on the TV which doesn't set a good tone anywhere much less a restaurant. Their weekday breakfast special is great. $5.50 including coffee and the grits are great. I would give 4 stars but Fox so called news took a star away."}
{"text":"New ownership. Under the new owners they have great food and great service. If you have not tried them lately you are in for a wonderful treat, if you have you know what I am describing. 
They serve breakfast all day, as well as other types of food."}
{"text":"This really is a great little cafe! I took my parents to brunch on a Sunday morning. We arrived around 10:30am and were immediately seated. Good thing we got there when we did because the place filled up fast. The server was great even when the restaurant was slammed and the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable! And I was impressed by how great the grits were bc most places are bland. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I like this little café !  New owners and they are really trying to do different things !  Have been going there for several years on Sunday for breakfast with my sister.  This is the best it has ever been !  The food is good and the coffee is wonderful !  Give it a try !!  A happy place !!"}
{"text":"I got the club. Being as though I am from Jersey and our club is turkey without ham the sandwich was ok. I feel that kraft singles do not belong on any sandwich whatsoever so I was taking that off my club. The fries were horrible. They reminded me of when BK changed their fries to that weird crispy and then over cooked. French fries should be easy...dont get cheap on the fries and dont put kraft singles on sandwiches. Judy is a great waitress. She was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Hands Down the food was amazing.  Went in for breakfast. Everything I ordered was cooked to perfection.  The staff was courteous and the service was fast.
I will frequent this establishment again."}
{"text":"\"So many friends, so few seats...\" is the slogan for Park 51. This is a very cozy joint that feels more like a diner than a cafe, which was comforting considering I haven't found anyplace like this in Charlotte as of yet. The servers are all friendly and comfortable, not just the over enthused and over trained servers in many of the restaurants in the area, but fun waitresses that seem to enjoy interacting with the people who dine there all day long. You will feel warm and welcomed when you enter. 

They offer a wide range of dishes from pitas to Italian, burgers and sandwiches to desserts, and they have one of the best cups of coffee I have tasted since I moved down here. Truly a one of a kind place."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here this morning, while waiting for Firestone to change my oil and rotate my tires.  I was so happy that it was within very short walking distance from the tire place, saving me from a fast-food breakfast.
I did the gyro omelette with hash browns and a biscuit.  
The food was great, the service was great, and the diner ambiance in this place is great!  It wasn't very crowded; I was surprised at how quiet this place was.  I had a great experience, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited these guys multiple times and I have yet to have a bad meal or bad service.  Glad they are starting to serve dinner.  Take time to give them a try.  Great food, service at a good price.
Try the deep fried cheesecake with ice cream. YUM."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday around time for brunch and were informed after we ordered that they only had ONE more biscuit and was that ok? Our order required 3...so no that's not ok.  The food is mediocre at best and the staff doesn't speak very good English. I ordered a chicken philly, what I got was lunch meat chicken warmed up with onions peppers and mushrooms. Another person in the group got a panini and specifically asked for no onions no tomatoes and got both on their sandwich - when we sent it back they literally just took them off and handed it back.   Overall it was not the worst food we've ever had but we will definitely not be going back or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Very upsetting!  Park 51 cafe is under new management.  Some of the new staff not near as friendly.  Norman, who has been there over 20 years is gone.  He was always quick to fill tea and bring out food if the waitresses were busy.  My husband and I started coming here when we were dating.  Now we need to find another breakfast place."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. Super friendly wait staff and the service is super fast. A good variety for lunch also. You can't beat the value for what you get. Love this place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is awesome here. The restaurant has a nice private family atmosphere. It's a great place to take the kids and a great place to go when you don't want to be at a big chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Fridays I am usually on my own for lunch so it's my chance to try something new because some of my coworkers are less adventurous.

I've been eying Park 51 Cafe for a while since I frequent other businesses in the area.  So I venture in.

Like others have said, it's not a fancy place.  In fact you feel like it's a small step back into time when you enter.  It's also a bit confusing.  The sign says seat yourself but do you take a menu with you or do they bring one out to you?

I hit it during the busy Friday lunch hour and it was full when I got there except for 2 tables.  I picked the closest booth.   I waited a good 10 minutes before someone took a drink order and then came back with a menu.  I saw other people take menus with them when they sat down so maybe that is the way to do this.

Anyway, the menu consists of many options...sandwiches, wraps, italian options and then the lunch specials menu which is your typical meat and 2 veggie menu.

A good test for places like this is the meatloaf.  It's a staple at places like this so that's what I went with.  It took a while for my meal to come out..not sure why because other people who were seated after me got served quicker but when it came out it was piping hot and when it entered my mouth, I forgot all about the wait time.

The meatloaf was very flavorful.  I could taste the herbs used and it was nicely seasoned and not overly salted like many meat and 2/3 places do it.  The mashed taters were perfect - great consistency with bits of potato and nicely seasoned.  The turnip greens were flavorful as well.  And the unsweetened iced tea also had a nice flavor to it.  The meal also came with free soup which todays choices were vegetable and chicken rice.  I chose the vegetable which was also tasty with bits of squash in it.

My server was a sweet southern lady who kept me updated on my meal's status and constantly kept checking back on me.  Despite some initial service flaws, she still got at 50% tip.

The moral of this story:  Hole-in-the-wall places almost always have the best food.  Park 51 is no exception."}
{"text":"Manger greated us soon as we walked in,with a smile. So did the waitrest. The soup that came with the meal was Campbells i'm sure. :-/
I got the spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread and side of baked mac and cheese.
Was yummie!"}
