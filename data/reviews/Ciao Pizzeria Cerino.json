{"text":"We have had a couple pizzas, a salad and four pasta dishes from Ciao, and all were very good. Until two days ago when I got an order of spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was great but the meatballs were tough and rubbery. I threw them out, inedible. I will go back, but avoid Mama's meatballs."}
{"text":"We are HUGE fans of cerinos in seven hills and our family was THRILLED this opened in Brecksville and could be delivered to our house.
I had the caprese sandwich and it was perfect.  My husband got the meatball sub and that was great too.  The Pizza was delicious and not too greasy.  My kids loved it.
The delivery was fast...they said 45 min and it came a bit quicker than that.  We will definitely be ordering again.  So great to have such a delicious meal delivered!!!!  I'm afraid this will be a great saver when a quick easy and very good dinner is needed."}
{"text":"Welcome back Eddie C!!!  Great takeout/delivery menu and quality. This place just opened on Tuesday and we gave it a try tonight. We opted for takeout instead of delivery.  We will be back!!

We ordered the Pizza Margherita, large Pizzeria House Salad, and the full size Chicken Sorrento.  The quality and portions were awesome and easily fed the 3 of us. The pasta in the Chicken Sorrento was cooked perfectly and the breaded chicken was very tasty. The pizza had a great crust and flavor. The salad was fresh and the ingredients were all high quality. We will be ordering these items again!  The food was well packaged for transport as well. Loved the garlic bread- soft and fresh.

We can't wait to try other items!"}
{"text":"We frequently eat at Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino in Seven Hills (I will review next time we eat there) and it is one of our favorite local restaurants outside of downtown Cleveland. So when we heard about this new spin off in Brecksville we were very excited. We felt it was the same, except they deliver! We had the fried zucchini appetizer, which was to be expected for delivered fried food. My wife got the baked ravioli entree, half portion, that is a cheese filled ravioli with a cream sauce. It is one of our favorite dishes at Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino and it did not disappoint from here. I had the chicken parmigiana, which is my favorite dish, and once again it did not disappoint. The full entree is well worth the money because it comes with two large chicken breasts, with a great crust that is fried to a perfect crisp! Then it is topped with a little marinara sauce, some slices of tomato and provolone cheese.  All in all, this was very good food, from a great local restaurant, that delivers!"}
{"text":"We have had the house salad at Eddie's and loved it; however, when we had it here it seemed very small. We have had their bread twice (just the bread) and one serving was small and the other time it had more - I think it depends on who is filling your order. I gave this place 5 stars because of the bread - it is out of this world."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and even better service! Quick delivery and they even threw in a complimentary piece of strawberry cake. Diverse, upscale menu (a nice change from the typical pizza joint) with reasonable prices, definitely check this place out!"}
