{"text":"Burgers and fries are pre-packaged and pre-frozen.  I was really hoping for a score here because this restaurant is at the end of my street.  I heard they have a good BbQ burger but I haven't tried it yet.  I'll prob give it 1 more try so I can try the milkshakes too."}
{"text":"pretty decent burgers...  ...although they are just frozen pre-formed patties. They aren't the best burgers i've ever had, but I have to say that they are really good, especially considering the price. the food is very similar in quality to Burger Inn, but Sunny's seems to have more creative burgers, topping-wise. The burgers are also pretty big - i could barely finish my double burger. I think i'll get the single next time. The Texas burger has BBQ sauce, banana peppers, pickles, and lettuce (i added cheese, too). it's very good."}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon as it is right near my office just off Glenmore Trail. I have driven by the place many a times, and finally today went in.  The short answer: skip the food, go for the ice cream.  Everything is all made from frozen stuff, and all tastes bland. I ordered the double mushroom burger and found hair in my burger! I couldn't finish. The only thing I will give them on the food is the prices are very low - $1.65 for fries, under $3.50 for most burgers. I'm not eating food here again myself though.  The good: The ice cream is Foothills Creamery, and very good. Large portions and decent prices. $4.65 for a huge waffle cone of New York Cherry Cheesecake yum! Not a huge selection but about 12 really good flavor choices. Stuff like Cookies and Cream, Birthday Cake, Tiger Tale, Bubble Gum, Mint, etc. All you would ever need for ice cream."}
