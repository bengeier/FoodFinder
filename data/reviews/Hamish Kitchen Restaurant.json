{"text":"Actually enjoyed this place due to its great portions. I got the halibut with less fries and it was just the right serving with a handful of tartar sauce packets. The place wasn't busy at all so it was fairly quiet, but we enjoyed our stay and the service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Miss the old location but this new one is much much cleaner. You can never go wrong with the food here, be it fish, shrimp?, the food is always great and fresh. Service is always excellent as well."}
{"text":"Better than McCowan F&C!!!
They take credit cards.

Bought 2 haddocks & few chips, $21.
Huge/FRESH and crispy-addictive!
Chips, however, were not \"old-school\"....
but still ok."}
{"text":"Used to go their old location and liked it there. Been to their new location (this one) several times and are always leave full and satisfied. Service is friendly and efficient, the fish has an amazingly light batter and the fries are always hot and fresh.

4* because they don't have the best tartar sauce and they should really make their own onion rings. Those store bought frozen ones don't cut it.

Will actually be going with the family again for early dinner."}
{"text":"I had the halibut and chips. The breading on the fish was light and flavorful. I have to say it was close to perfect.  The fries and the fish were cooked perfectly. I would have given this 5 Stars if the fries were a little thicker."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. Nice quiet environment.  Lovely owners. Lots of parking. Clam soup is delicious."}
{"text":"$9.79 or something close to that sum for a haddock and fry feast for lunch! The fish was light and a wee bit greasy, but it's deep-fried so what can you really expect? To be honest, I ate the whole serving, so I dare say I enjoyed it! The restaurant is clean and spacious though I do feel I left smelling like the frier. Maybe the joint would benefit from a better exhaust system in the kitchen, but I know I am being a fusspot. Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch here and I do look forward to returning for my next monthly calorie splurge! As a side note, our lovely server informed us that they are updating the menu to feature some more weight conscious options."}
{"text":"It's located in the empty plaza near Comstock and Lebovic intersection. I come here for Haddock and halibut with sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Met a friend here. She highly recommended this place for lunch.
Fish and chips are the mainstay here, one of my favourite meals, so I was curious to taste their product.
I was not disappointed.
I ordered the fish and chips ($12, if memory serves me, and a not bad price). My friend ordered the Fish and a Few plus the cole slaw side. We both ordered the  halibut.
The fish was fresh and had the most delicious batter, light and tasty. Fries were fresh as well. The slaw looked pretty good and according to my friend, was fresh, crisp and tasty.
Service was prompt.
Prices are pretty reasonable.
I enjoyed my meal and would definitely recommend this place to friends.
The restaurant is clean and well lit and utilitarian. Nothing fancy but efficient.
Good food. Good value. Good parking"}
