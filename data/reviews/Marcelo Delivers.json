{"text":"I looked up the company and saw they were open 24/7, and was so relieved because the place I wanted didn't deliver that far to my house. I called twice, he finally answered and sounded like I woke him up. I asked \"You deliver 24/7 right?\" And he responded \"normally, yeah. But not right now.\" And hung up. I could tell he had been asleep. If you're going to mention you're 24/7 hours on Yelp, then be professional and work 24/7. There is a reason people choose you."}
{"text":"The BEST local courier/delivery service in Phoenix! Every 3 to 6 months I find myself out there with a long to-do list and very little time (and very little means of transportation). Marcelo was able to accommodate my requests for delivery assistance flawlessly. What I loved the most was being able to facilitate it all through text! He was on time, great with communication, and made my life SO easy. I really appreciate him and will definitely be utilizing his services the next time I am in the area. Thank you so much, Marcelo!"}
{"text":"Marcelo is awesome! Friendly, reliable and always gets my order just right and goes to the stores that I request. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Marcelo helped us make a birthday surprise magical for an important client. It was such a short notice but he delivered with the best quality. 
We like how there are videos and images of the deliveries. It was very helpful.
We're looking forward to making deliveries in TX with him soon!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Marcelo Delivers deserves more than five stars! The service was not only perfect but the customer service was incredible and unlike any I've experienced in a very long while. 

I text the business line (yes, text -- they care THAT MUCH!) around 11 pm on Sunday night and by 10 am the next day my package was on its way to its destination. Not only was the response and actual service fast, but Marcelo kept in touch with me for the entire process, even sending pictures of delivery and letting me know how excited my client was to receive the package. 

I will definitely be using Marcelo Delivers again and recommend anyone in any area of the valley to give them a call. 

Can't thank you all enough! 

FYI my package was Peoria to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Marcelo was very willing to help me way out in the west valley and was very courteous as well. As I no longer drive a vehicle,  I will continue to use his services and would recommend his assistance to anyone wanting or needing assistance in courier and travel."}
