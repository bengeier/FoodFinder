{"text":"I'm so fortunate to have been at this incredible young lady's first public event!! Camp North End featured this high school entrepreneur (with the help and support of her awesome parents-Dad's gotten really good at toasting those marshmallows!) that serves up HOMEMADE, HUGE, YUMMY S'MORES!!! That's right. Charlotte's got a mobile s'mores cart now!! Yeeeees!!!  Let me tell you, ya gotta find this cart!! And check out the back story. You find yourself really wanting to support this bright young lady's endeavor.  Crunchy, flavorful, HOMEMADE graham crackers. A huge, thick, HOMEMADE, perfectly toasted, not too sweet marshmallow. And a slab of high-quality (Lindt was used tonight) chocolate.  I found MY supper!!  The other mobile was The Dumpling Lady(love ya girl), and I overheard several people most excited about the s'mores. Big hit! Did I mention they're homemade? Tonight the choice of flavors were: \"Classic\"- vanilla marshmallow & milk chocolate.  \"Salted Caramel\"- caramel marshmallow, milk chocolate, & caramel drizzle.  \"Pumpkin\"- pumpkin marshmallow & white chocolate.    See?!?! Cravin' one right now, aren't ya!"}
{"text":"Fantastic idea and great execution. S'mores get messy but it's worth it!! Homemade marshmallows are toasted right in front of you, and even the chocolate is toasted so it melts perfectly. Toasted to perfection so they are golden brown and not burnt. Graham crackers are to die for."}
{"text":"Best smore I've ever had! Home made marshmallow and graham crackers  I had the salted caramel one and it was phenomenal. I've been keeping my eye out for this food stand/truck since"}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuum! Let me repeat that for those of you in the back... YUUUUUUUM!! This family owned food cart is serving up gourmet s'mores with a smile. On our first visit (they were stationed at Resident Culture) we tried the salted caramel s'more and a few of their mallow pops.   The s'more was heavenly! Their graham crackers and marshmallows are handcrafted and clearly made with TLC. They use Lindt chocolate in their s'mores. I can only imagine they did their research because the Lindt was just the right size for the graham and melted perfectly under the toasted marshmallow. Speaking of, I love that the torch the marshmallow right in front of you!   The mallow pops we tried were also tasty but not quite on the same level as the freshly made s'mores. Next time, we'll order one of every flavor s'more they're offering and skip the pops.   Do yourself a favor. Go like The Toasting Company on Instagram right now to stalk where they'll be next and make plans to visit them ASAP! You can thank me once you've stuffed yourself with delicious s'mores."}
