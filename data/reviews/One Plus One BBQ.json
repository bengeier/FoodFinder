{"text":"My first visit for take out was very disappointing. Only ordered a few meat skewers thinking it would be fast. A large table next to me came in later and started ordering after 10 minutes after I paid for my take out. Because they were dining in with tips, they got 5+ dishes and a handful of meat skewers before I got to see my order. WTF!  Food not cheap compared to similar food stalls around. I gave a star for the lamb skewers that were more meaty but still loaded with MSG.  The skewers that boasted crispy bones were too hard to bite into. Which means it was way too expensive as less than 10% was edible. These skewers costs $5 for 4 skewers not including tax."}
{"text":"Hands down best skewer place in Markham/Scarborough (trifecta of good price, above average taste, great portions).   If you're looking for a place to chill with your homies while snacking on skewers, this is the place."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Went there on Monday night, ordered my food and it never came and end up leaving. Tried their food before and it was not surprisingly good. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The lamb BBQ tastes more like what you would have in China, other BBQ dishes e.g. BBQ fish are good too."}
{"text":"Yum! I really loved the bbq here and I can't wait to go back! It might seem a little salty and spicy for others but I found it perfect. I'm from northern China so my tastes buds are pretty heavy.  The prices are okay, not too expensive but not cheap either. I recommend the bbq that says 4 skewers and not the ones that says 1 serving. The one comes on a plate like stir fry and doesn't seem like bbq lol   Overall I liked it, speed was okay and food was to my taste."}
{"text":"poor service, owner yelling to the staff all the time. rush the customers to pay the bill on a Wednesday night for the table,(12/7/16) food quality were so-so, i am a chef, and won't' recommend this place . too much MSG on the food, food is dry"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with one other person, on a monday night. as it is the start of the work week. the restaurant was not too busy. This restaurant one of the many in Scarborough in northern style Chinese BBQ, so unlike traditional Cantonese style with the sweet and salty flavor that is dominant. The northern style is more spicy and savory.   The things that are must try for any bbq restaurant is of course the BBQ Lamb Skewers. , i ordered those as well as the BBQ spicy pork rib, Chicken Gizzard, and Mussels.  The BBQ meat at this restaurant is pretty good, the meat is tender and just write, and the spicy pork ribs is very different then most available in toronto, and is definitely recommended. I do enjoy spicy, however i would suggest those who cannot take spicy to be careful as this restaurant has a stronger spice then others.   The Mussels for this restuarants is not bad however i would suggest for more then 2 people you need definetely a bigger portion cause it is very small meat and you will finish it quickly.   The vegetable we ordered the spicy and sour shredded potato, has a good wok flavour, however i find the spicyness is too overpowering and not much sour flavour into it.  The service in this place is not bad they were very efficient with the food, and the water.  overall i find that although the flavour was not bad, and most dishes they cook pretty wel, they do seem to favour a heavier flavour then most other bbq restaurants, which for some people and i know a few who commented throughout this restaurant is the one thing they prefer them to do less of.   i would go again to this restuarant of course"}
{"text":"There was a lineup so we decided to do takeout instead. Inside is very small, and tables are placed close together. There wasn't really anywhere to stand and wait for our order (20min wait) so we went outside and took a walk around the plaza.   We ordered BBQ lamb, bean curd, shredded potato,  stir fried veggies but it was mostly cabbage lol, and fried bread with condensed milk. Each order was packed in aluminum foil lined styrofoam containers, probably to retain the heat longer.  Everything tasted good, no complaints. I was actually expecting the skewers to be saltier but they were perfect. Maybe I just went on a good day?   If I'm with a group of friends I'll definitely dine in but if it's just just me and my bf, I'd most likely do take out again. Only next time I'll phone in my order to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Food is decent for the most part. However, the restaurant needs better ventilation and a serious scrub down.   The best of the night was jelly noodles in sesame sauce - no wonder almost every table had an order. Kungpao chicken came next and was disappointing with unevenly cut, over-seasoned chicken bits. Lamb skewers weren't bad. The dry pot cauliflower had nice flavour, but more than half the dish was onion, chilli and other inedibles. More cauliflower! Please and thank you.   Not very impressed with the atmosphere (think grimy floors, smokey air), or service. But I would come back for the cold noodles (take out)."}
{"text":"Pricing pretty good.   Food pretty good.  I love bbq skewers!!! I always ask for less salt & less MSG.  If ur going to eat it with rice then leave it to how it is originally.  All the food is pretty decent.  Portions are decent.  Decor is simple restaurant style.  There was a bit of a wait when I went on the weekend.  Overall pretty good experience.  Will return."}
{"text":"Came here to try out their skewers as I'm a huge fan of lamb skewers. Though they are cheaper than where I usually go at $4.99 for 4 skewers, you must order in 4s for most of the skewers, which becomes more expensive. Also, they are way too salty for my taste. I'm realizing after seeing another review that I could have asked for less salt and less MSG, but their standard flavouring shouldn't be that salty.  The fried vegetable dishes were also basically swimming in oil.  The caramelized sweet potato was actually pretty good, so crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside. Would actually come back to try the caramelized taro.  Likely wouldn't come back here, but if I did I would definitely ask for less oil/less salt/less MSG. Or maybe try one of the hotpots that I saw other tables having."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant, only Chinese customers n the renovation make you feel like you are in China, food is spicy but taste good. Don't expect any service nor cleanness of the restaurant, the food itself will surprise you."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner, ive only been here before for a late night snack since they do close late! And wow... didnt know they were so popular. All tables were booked and long line ups. Thank god i got a table shortly as it was still early, around 6ish.   Always love their skewers of any kind. Strong flavours and is on the salty side for some people. But my mom loved it. This time, we also tried the fish pot. Thats was good too, but ill stick with the skewers. Lastly the cold noodle appetizer, i lovedddd it. Mainly cuz ive been craving for it for a bit lol   Heres what I got: Cold noodle appetizer   Lamb skewers Beef skewers Chicken heart skewers Bean curs roll skewers  Fish pot with  Veggies, fungus, bean curd and noodles.   Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and cheap skewer place in the area. Open late. No complaints about the food at all, definitely worth the money. The only thing I had to mention was that they have coca cola chicken wings. I had to try it because I had a failed attempt in making it before. It was not what I expected. It's just very sweet, you can't taste coca cola at all. Almost just like honey."}
