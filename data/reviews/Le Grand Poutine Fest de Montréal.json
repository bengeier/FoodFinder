{"text":"Great festival but we had some missing poutines on Sunday (las day, my only visit). The rain caused a lot of mud on the ground. Be prepared to use water resistant boots if it rains next event.  Good ambience and music. The public is absolutely great! You will feel welcome."}
{"text":"As a summer event in Old Port - this event didn't make the cut. More like leftovers of ribfest space. I thought the participating vendors would offer a creative menu but it was pretty average. Each contender had the same base of fries and cheese curds with different toppings including - lobster, fish, calamari, jerk meat, teriyaki or Greek to name a few. Prices started at 14$ but most dishes were good for 2 or more people.  I tried Charlie Shack's lobster roll poutine at 19$ - but it was more fresh lobster topping a basic poutine, which was light and not too heavy. I enjoyed took me back to Maine which is where Charlie's shack is based out of. Definitely not a lobster roll! Lacked the creamy cold base.   There were fair games, fresh lemonade at $5.50, corn on the cob for $5, and bars. This event was also cash only.   Maybe better luck next year- Foie Gras poutine or something with sweet potato fries? I have yet to be further impressed as a local!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp and Le Grand Poutine Fest, I had the chance to eat way more poutine than I ever did in one sitting. Big shoutout to Mariko and Alex for welcoming us!  They changed the location of the Poutine Fest this year. It used to be on concrete ground, closer to the water, but this time they set it close to the train track, on a rather weird ground covered in straw and pebbles. The downside is that rain made parts of the ground quite muddy. We sat in the shade near the lemonade stand, and enjoyed a nice cup of lemonade while waiting for the other judges. There were about 17 trucks present at the Poutine Fest, and 10 poutines were competing for this year's Best Poutine title.  When the food came, all eyes turned to our table. What a glorious sight!!! It was a blinded poutine tasting, so the dishes were named from \"A\" to \"J\".  A: Poutine covered in chopped smoke meat and topped with pickles. Not a lot of sauce, which made the dish a bit dry. It was also a bit spicy - maybe from black pepper? B: Poutine topped with very tender shredded beef stewed in a rich, unctious gravy, and garnished with chopped chives. The fries were thin and soaked up the flavors. Best sauce of the bunch!  C: Poutine topped with PopCurds, which are breaded cheese curds from a company in Casselman, Ontario. It's meant to be \"deep fried cheese curds\", which sounds amaaazing. Sadly the ones served with the poutine were not hot, and so tasted more like a dryer version of regular curds. D: Poutine topped with chunks of shredded BBQ meat. Unfortunately the meat itself was not really flavored, and so the BBQ sauce was pretty much the only thing you could taste.  E: Poutine topped with deep fried calamari and white sauce. I love calamari and seafood poutine, but the sauce was very thick and could only coat the top layer of the poutine. The rest was just sitting there, dry. F: Burrito Poutine!! I thought it would be melting cheese, sauce and fries in there, but my first bite was of ... coleslaw?? I tasted BBQ sauce in my second bite. Not sure what was going on there, but I didn't like it that much. G: Spaghetti poutine covered in a mountain of meat sauce. The sauce was quite tasty but again, rather dry, so fries in the lower layers of the dish remained bland. There were little square chunks of commercial hamburger patties throughout the poutine, but they were thin and dry. The fries looked suspiciously like the ones you buy from the frozen aisles of grocery stores. H: Another BBQ poutine, covered in shreds of rather flavorful pork! The sauce was quite rich, and the fries still had a generous amount of potato skin.  I: They weren't ready and forfeited. :( J: I was wondering if by the time I made it to this last poutine, I would already have lost my appetite, but a bite of this one convinced me that we had a winner. \"J\" is a hamburger poutine, covered in chunks of gound beef, bacon and caramelized onions, all covered in a drizzle of yellow cheese. It tasted like a hamburger, and felt like a poutine. The perfect hybrid!   After this giganormous meal, we all sent our scores and the winner was declared. Four out of five judges chose \"J\" as their favorite. Many also had \"B\" in second place. And so we crowned Greg's Diner's Hamburger Poutine winner of the Poutine Fest 2017!  Till next year!!"}
{"text":"Another fun festival to go to in the summer. Happens right after ribfest and is located in the same spot.   A bunch of poutine food trucks everywhere and other various snacks (onion blossom). The poutines vary from classic to out of the box weirdness (a poutine with Chinese food on top for example)  I highly recommend going in a group because it's a lot of food.   I wish the portions had been smaller so I could have tasted more than one!   Seating is a bit limited and it mostly is cash only. So keep those in mind if you plan on visiting."}
{"text":"In one word: Monotonous.   5 stars for the company I enjoyed while poutine tasting (i.e. my fellow Yelpers -- u guys made tonight worth it, by far the best part, and thank you!) ...but for a poutine fest I will agree with the overall sentiment that Mtl's A-Game poutiniers were mostly absent. (trademarking the word poutiniers: Kandib√©coise!)  It was essentially the same poutine at every kiosk over and over again with minor variations, bacon here, brisket there, seafood at the otha. Not at all representative of Mtls greatest. And they were all ridiculously overpriced: those poutines were not worth 13$/ 16$ in the slightest.   Next year I'll skip this festival and just go straight to Vladimir Poutine (who were NOT at this year's fest btw)."}
{"text":"Four stars, but a weak four stars. The event organizers get points, the food trucks, not so much.  There was a selection of 8-10 food trucks selling poutine. As someone who is a senior member of the Yelp Poutine Committee, and as a lifetime Montrealer, I have tasted many of Montreal's finest poutines. The food I had at this festival however was not up to par. The size and layout of the festival met my expectations, and I was happy to see ample seating was available. A number of country fair style games was also a nice touch. The event itself is free which always has my support, and the location in the old port made it easy to \"walk it off\" after gorging on some of the heaviest food our city has to offer. Thanks to the organizers for doing a great job!  Well that's the end of the good.   The food itself left MUCH to be desired. I saw no cilantro, no green onion, not a single \"finishing touch\" to ANY of the poutines, and we were a large group who tried one of everything. Have some pride in your presentation. There was ONE vegan / vegetarian option and every stall had the same 3/4 ingredients. Now, I know what you're thinking. ITS POUTINE! Of course it'll be the same ingredients...  YOU'RE WRONG. At such events, it is no longer sacrilege to use an alternative to curd cheese (only 2 of the 20+ offerings had an alternative cheese including the vegan option). Where was the goat cheese poutine? Every gravy tasted exactly the same! Where was the peppercorn gravy? Where was the bourbon gravy or the flavorful BBQ based gravy? Not at this event. Interesting toppings? You mean like fishy tasting lobster or the overly watery braised beef? It's not like they were all terrible, but it was like no one was trying to stand out, just serve food and make them dolla' bills. No one bothered to garner repeat business. Particularly disappointing considering the prices included the (expected) old port / festival surcharge. They were mostly sizable enough for 2 people which makes it ok.   To end on a positive note; shout out to Seasoned Dreams! Which ones were they? Follow the smoke and it'll lead you right to them because they were the only poutine people actually cooking food on site rather than serving you whatever they had in their buffet style service trays. At least that's what it looked like after being served slop toppings on the \"fresh\" fries at every food truck.   Notes for next year: all stalls should use a branded wax paper base like some of the stalls did. We tried to find the creator of a brisket poutine that we all liked but we couldn't figure out which stall it came from because they all looked like the same brown mess!"}
{"text":"I was so happy that I was in Montreal this weekend because they were having their poutine festival. Located right in the heart of the Old Port in downtown Montreal, it was the place to be.  First of all, no entry fee.  Secondly, you have so many vendors to choose from with a variety of gourmet like poutines. I had the pleasure of trying the deep fried curd poutine, and it was absolutely delicious. Every bite had the right ratio of fries, gravy and curds.  That's all you need with a good beer to compliment it.   They also had some interesting poutines like seafood poutine with a tartar sauce like gravy. And, jerk pork poutine. So many options for those with different palates. I'm sure you'll find that one poutine that will make you smile.   This festival is great for group of friends because you can all order different poutines and share. I only wished they had more benches to sit and enjoy your meal. It was so limited that you were waiting in line for an available seat."}
{"text":"Poutine? Yes please. I had the opportunity to try so many different takes on what is an infamous dish and every one I had was great. Jerk Chicken poutine. Lobster Poutine. BBQ Poutine. The list goes on and on.   The downside is that I never got the opportunity to try all the poutines that I wanted to try!"}
