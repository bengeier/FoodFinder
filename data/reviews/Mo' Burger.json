{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. First off they didn't have onion rings, pico de gallo, or guacamole. The girl at the counter was very rude. And my burger was so horrible I took it back. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is perfect before a movie because there is nothing better than a burger and beer without the responsibility of driving. The food is great too but they have disappointed me a few times. I always order the fried mushrooms and the order changes every time. The size can be really big or very small depending on the cooks mood apparently. I overheard the manager speaking to customers and his employees and as a manager myself, I have to say that he was very rude and de motivating. I love the place but they need consistency and new management."}
{"text":"My second visit to this location confirmed that my first visit was not a fluke when it came to the service. First, the burgers are pretty delicious but everything around the burger is very lack luster.  The french fries were cold both times, and they just didn't hold up to the same quality to the burgers. Their nachos are very ball park. Secondly the staff does not give a friendly vibe, no one there seems happy. I didn't like the girl who was helping us order at all, she really could use a smile.

One last thing, everything is sold separately, and it's all very pricey."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are good
A slight on the greasy side. Ordered 2 burger meals and a child meal and was about $40.00 
Food is good but too pricey for my blood."}
{"text":"Had a burger that was okay. Ordered grilled onions that weren't very grilled. Fries were bland and the ketchup tasted weird. Friend tried the ketchup and thought the same. I guess for mall food it was fine, just don't expect much."}
{"text":"The burgers were good, but definitely not worth the 20 bucks that we spent for two burgers and a shake. The patties were thinner than Jack-in-the-Box, and they only put two small pieces of onion on my burger which was a little disappointing because I love onions. Not too bad, you'd just expect more from a place called \"Mo' Burger\".
Pros: Tasty and quick.
Cons: Very thin patty, minimal vegetables, and pricey."}
{"text":"I felt so rushed and not valued. I asked for fries twice and they were not added. My daughter didn't get the bacon that was added on her burger. The taste was fine but not woth the cost and feeling of rushed."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a very long time.  The entire food court was redone.  Lots of good selections.  We tried Mo Burger and are coming back soon.  Had the Mo Crunch....mmmm Doritos and guacamole.....mmmm"}
{"text":"The burgers here are pretty good I do enjoy them. French fries are one of my favorite foods and theirs aren't very good. I work in the restaurant industry so I know what it feels like to be understaffed and busy. I didn't mind the waiting so much but the lack of personality here is disappointing. Regardless of what is going on, a positive attitude goes a long way. You could read it all over the manager's face and tone of her voice that she was annoyed and stressed. We're all human. No one is going to rip your head off if you're nice and friendly with them. I don't think this place is awful; I do like it, but a few small changes could make a big difference!"}
{"text":"I will never, ever ever ever ever ever, eat at this place again.  First, way too over priced ($29.98) for a Burger joint with unexceptional &  forgettable burgers.  My son and I tried this place after a movie and it was horrible experience from the service to the food.  

The staff are very non attentive from the start of the order all the way to getting your food, I mean this place needs a cryogenic chamber to freeze you in state while you wait for your order (they were not even busy when we went) and be thawed out when they finally get it to you in a lukewarm state.  

The food is also way too greasy, I mean I know a burger will drip a bit of grease but this was a downright leak, the onion rings were saturated and the soggy fries my son had.  I firmly believe this place will be out of business soon as it is not going to get return business because it either needs a burger that lives up to the price, or a price that lives up to the burger they currently sale. 

In the future I will hold my hunger and get to in & out."}
{"text":"The food is tasteless because this fucking awful ass , stingy ass manger is not giving the customers the opportunity to get the. Condiment they need instead this greedy motherfucker got them station behind the counter were he can tell customer if they need extra go to the line where u will be charge . I bet he would charge for refill had the despisers been station behind the counter and not in the front , complete horrible service. He hates his job and it shows . First time here Last time here fucking jerks"}
{"text":"Lol! What a joke paid $6 for a tiny burger paid $2 for small fries that were crusty and old,  then I paid 97 cent upgrade for order of onion rings so almost $4 lol,  4 thin pieces barely any onion just batter.  Lol I spent $20 for a tease I'll never eat there I wish Chef Ramsey from kitchen nightmares would eat there lol.  What a joke cheap skates!! Not good business after given me day old fries made me pay to get fresh onion rings only to get 4 slivers for $4. crazy how cheap this world has come too.  The place makes it look like some real American food false advertisement! Lol The owner should be ashamed"}
{"text":"The food did not taste good and the service wasn't good at all and it was the longest wait! And the manager toughed the trash and the trash cans then touched cleaning supplies then started touching peoples food without washing her hands! And she wasnt wearing gloves! This was the worst burger I have ever had! Atleast the manager didn't touch my food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm honestly shocked at some of the reviews. The burgers use only the freshest ingredients, and that's why it's not the same price as a greasy McDonald's dollar menu item. My sister and I came here for the first time today and split Mo's Bacon Burger which has a double patty, cheddar cheese, bacon, ranch, BBQ sauce, and lettuce and tomato. We also split some onion rings. They were SO good!!! Also, the onion rings were cut and cooked perfectly so they didn't create a sloppy mess. The price was actually pretty decent considering the quality, and I like that you can get quick and delicious food while you shop.

They also cater which is awesome to know because I'm already craving another burger from there. I got to meet the owner as well and he was extremely friendly and wanted to make sure we were well taken care of. I encourage anyone who's at the mall for lunch to give this place a chance, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again.over 25 bucks and there was no No cheese on my nachos i got chips with what appears to ground beef and a dollop of sour vream. And for 4 bucks i should get more than 4 onion rings. Rip off!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! I paid $5 and got 5 onion rings thats a rip off they need to double the amount I was expecting atleast a basket full don't come here for onion rings it doesn't tast good either."}
{"text":"Was very hungry after a movie! This place isn't gourmet or anything but was really good for a burger! Very juicy plus the cashier was really sweet!"}
{"text":"iThe food looks better in the pictures. I tried the Mo Nachos, which basically has Doritos in it. Fries are soft and soggy and the onion rings are a little undercooked. They serve beer, but the guy at the register is still figuring out how to pour beer from the tap without foaming too much...I give it to him for trying, but either someone should have shown him how before or someone could've helped. Tables are a bit messy and not maintained too much. At the counter, they have several charging outlets for standard or USB plugins."}
{"text":"Decent enough for in and out quick burger when you are super hungry from shopping at the mall. The quality of the burger is ok, the buns were a bit too dry."}
{"text":"I can't give it 5 stars, because I haven't ever ordered a burger which seems to be their \"item\". With that being said I think this is a great place to stop by and get a snack before/after a movie. We stop often to grab a nacho and fry to share - both are yummy. For under $10 we can get that and two drinks (which are refillable if you sit in the section by the restaurant. I see lots of people with NFL jerseys there on the weekends as they play the games."}
{"text":"Ate at Philadelphia Airport on Day One. Absolutely on point. Great Burger..as good as any \"niche\" Brew Pub Burger, and perfect fries. Waiting for them to come to Texas!"}
{"text":"The ordering process was quick, but the time it took to get out food was too long for us to wait.... Eventually had to ask for a refund..."}
{"text":"The spicy sauce was good, but I really don't like the fries and they got my order wrong. Definitely not worth the $10. Especially since I didn't even get a drink with it."}
{"text":"Overpriced for no reason. 5 onion rings for 4 dollars? Seriously? That is the biggest rip off ever and the onion rings weren't even big and even if they were it wouldnt matter cause they're big pretty much everywhere and they give you way more for less money. Avoid this place at all costs. I will never come here again. The owner needs to stop ripping people off."}
{"text":"Amazing, our first time here and we love it. The burgers are fresh and the fries are great. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because the fries were a little cold but they were still good. Love that you can get a beer too! The kitchen looked clean, the employees were very nice and helped guide us through the menu. It is not fast food but it is good food. Strongly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The GM is a nice guy and came up with a unique concept of what my husband can do while I shop :)"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for a cheeseburger and onion rings, and my burger patty was only half a patty.  

Waiting an exorbitant amount of time for half my food is always my ideal..."}
{"text":"great burgers, I ordered bacon burger, it s a biggest american burger around tempe, I recondemned, for shoppers and traveler in the Tempe area"}
{"text":"First time at Mo' Burger in AZ Mills. The place was fairly hopping on a Sunday at lunchtime. 

We each ordered a burger and we shared fries. The bill came to $15.05. Ouch. They'd better be good. 

Our order arrived in about 8 mins (table service!). We asked for a side of mayo each but were told to go to the counter to get mayo packets. So much for table service. 

The Fries were pretty awful. I don't think there was a single French fry over 1 1/2\" long. We got ALL the scraps. Just toss those folks!

The burgers were the best part, fortunately. They were cooked to order and both were done right. My wife had asked for a lettuce bun, which she didn't get but since they dice the lettuce, we weren't overly surprised. 

Probably go to Johnny Rockets next time."}
{"text":"It's ok, but not great. You can get a good burger, better than McDonald's,  but not great. I ordered the Mo Bacon. I ordered grilled onions, $1 extra for that. Burger was $6.95 plus $1. They put regular onion slices, ungrilled, and put the grilled onions in between the patties. That was weird,  never had that before. The burger appeared a little sloppy. They could have done better with the presentation.  Taste was average for a high priced burger, I actually like the Carl's Jr. Super Star better. I don't like the crazy hustle and bustle of the mall. I prefer a more laid back atmosphere and less people...It's like eating in a football stadium. Fries were $2.69 and onion rings $3.69, and portion sizes were small to medium size, nothing worth that price.

I probably won't go back with so many other choices. For example,  try Lobby's Burger on McClintock and Southern in Tempe."}
{"text":"Service sucked, ordered 2 doubles got a single and a double. Was not even asked if we wanted drinks. Fries were soggy.  Very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"The cashier Mariah was rude, acted like she had something better to do, my fries were soaked in grease and I've paid less than 11$ for fries and a burger with better quality at real fast food places.  I will never eat here again.  Not to mention that price doesn't include a drink."}
{"text":"The burger was ok but the onion ring was very greasy. Price was not cheap for the food I got. The two young girls at the counters were very friendly though."}
{"text":"I read some negative comments about this place, the burger being flavorless and small? Came here to shop and got hungry, the mall was closing and this place looked good. We got the Mo Burger. I split it with my sister, big mistake, it was so good and flavorful, we both wished we ordered a whole one. The size is good and the flavor was great! If our shopping and hungry, I say you stop here. I wish there was more locations, since I love north Scottsdale and closer to me. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Horrifying experience, dining in means dining in. So instead of telling me you ran out of trays and proper serving items, you bring me and my son food in a bag and throw it on the table. I asked what is this. You'll just have to take it as it is, were out of everything for dine in. Okay.... Rule number one in food service never be rude to a customer, especially not in front of a child. I told my son this will be an eperience of many that he will learn nobody is allowed to just treat him any kind of way. I politely put everything in the bag, by the way the hamburger was bloody, no I cant have my son eat that. I spoke with a very calm voice not to interrupt other patrons and explained to her. This lady was taking orders yelling from the register. I guess he was the main manager, I calmly express my concerns, sir, your in the business to gain revenue not have an out of control employee yelling around here and acting crazy. I have been in this mall before this establishment existed and have never had an experience like this. I proceed to tell him, I get it, it's a Saturday, your busy, I use to run kitchens, I get it, but you need to pull her off the floor right now until she calms down, So i explain, I live in two worlds, corporate and culinary, if she was underneath me, I would of fired her. he did rectify the situation by giving all of my money back which in a nutshell I explained there is the AZ attorney general consumer behavior division I can just file my complaint there if you would like me to. Oh, I certified as well. I also own my catering business, and also have never had someone yelling at me like that let alone other customers', Thank you for giving my money back. But we will not ever be coming back there......."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars. Not quite 4. Came here on a whim. It seems like one of the better choices in the food court at AZ mills. It is a little closed off in the corner for patrons who chose to buy alcohol and they do have a bar. I'm pretty sure it is the only restaurant that sells alcohol. Anyways, bf and I ordered a create-your-own burger with a handful of the unlimited toppings and 2 premium toppings (75 cents each I believe) with a drink and onion rings which came out to be under $15. Not the typical affordable food court burger meal but the quality is pretty good. The burger was tasty. My sweet tooth was acting up and the sign for their \"Piecrete\" was speaking to me. I ordered a blueberry Piecrete (frozen vanilla custard with chunks of pie.. That's right, CHUNKS OF PIE!) and that made my night! there's a choice of apple, cherry, and blueberry. It was so rich and delicious I only needed a few bites and I was full and satisfied. Other than that, a pretty mediocre experience. The staff was friendly and the food came promptly. Probably will only come back for a Piecrete."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the mall today. I didn't have super high expectations given its at a mall food court. I was pleasantly surprised! The double cheeseburger with American cheese, frizzled onions, lettuce, tomato and pickle was delicious!! Tender, juicy, falling apart burger! Best I've had in a long time!!
Also got the hand cut fries. They were great too! Fresh tasting and cooked well. 
Fountain sodas with free refills to boot!
In all it was great!! I'd choose this again in a minute! If you find yourself at AZ Mills, give it a shot. Really yummy!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the chocolate shake ($3.99). It was supposed to be made out of frozen yogurt (think a Culver's Cement Mixer), but instead was just cold chocolate milk. I threw half of it away.

I got the Mo American burger ($5.95) which had two beef patties on a cold bun with American cheese, pickles, sauce, and lettuce. The burger tasted OK, but nothing special. Maybe a three star burger.

Service was OK. The tables and chairs needed a cleaning. Overall (2.5 stars), it made me wish that I had just walked across the mall to Johnny Rockets. I will not be visiting this food place again."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  The entire dining area was covered in trash, grease and uncollected garbage. The staff was rude and nonchalant regarding customer service. I ordered a draft from the tap, the cashier then went on to advise me there are no clean glasses, on a Sunday afternoon at 5:15 PM? As I sat at the booth awaiting my burger to arrive, I noticed two clearly under age teens consuming alcoholic beverages, from a Pilsner glass. After the teens were done with their beer, they asked for a refill, the cashier grab their cups, which have already been used, by the teens, walked over to the beer tap and proceeded to refill the same used glasses under the tap. Talk about a major health code violations. Ghetto service, ghetto mall, I guess ghetto a people need a place; AZ mills is that place.  Classy people beware! 2/26/2017"}
{"text":"Not thrilled. My burger was tasteless. Even fried onion straws had no flavor. Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"To start the girl at the register obviously does not like her job. My burger was missing items I had stated, twice, at the end when I received my food I asked the manager is I could get a ranch, he stated \"oh that's extra\" I than stated \"but I see it's on you FREE list of things to get with your burger. He than stated \" well that's if it's going on your burger but it's only .54 . I said \"no that's ok I just spent $10 on this burger so that's ok\". My burger bun was stale to top it off. Will not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"2nd visit Mo redeemed itself. Manager was on staff and had a great attitude. Burger was great again and the frys were delicious. And to top it off you can have a beer while you eat.. Cheers for adjusting the service!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. All of our food was super cold. My daughters hot dog was ice cold. I had to send it back. My moms burger was super cold she didn't even eat it. My wings were cold. I couldn't even bite through my onion rings. My mom asked for a to go box and all they gave her was a bag with paper in it. I will never return and the server was very rude. Way too expensive to be this nasty and have such bad customer service."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Spent almost $10 on burger, fries and drink and didn't even come close to filling me up! The food took awhile to come out and the fries were cold!!"}
{"text":"This is a prime example of when a place is easily outweighed by the bad things than the good things. 

My boyfriend and I had walked around the entire Arizona Mills mall and were really hungry. After looking around the food court, Mo' Burger seemed like the best option so we got in line.

I pretty much screamed when I saw they had tempura battered portobello mushrooms and decided I absolutely had to order some. So we got those as well as a hamburger on an everything bun and a cheeseburger on a potato bun. My boyfriend made his a meal and got a drink and fries. We sat down at a nearby table and waited. And waited. And waited some more.

It wasn't until about 15 minutes after we ordered that our food came out. I was not pleased by the guy's attitude because he thought it was okay to basically throw our food on our table. Almost spilling food on your customers isn't good service. (After sitting and eating for a while, I noticed his attitude extended to the other customers as well as the workers. He would shout and push past people waiting in line to order and bark at the cooks. He frequently sloshed and spilled beers as he was bringing them to tables. Not once did he go back to clean up the mess he made. Customers had to step around the spills. Talk about unacceptable!)

Despite his poor attitude, I was still extremely excited to try the mushrooms. I took a bite and burnt my tongue, it was so hot. BUT, that was a great sign to me because I knew they were cooked fresh! They were so crispy. I loved those tempura battered mushrooms, but they would have been ten times better if they just seasoned them! A little salt truly goes a long way. The rest of the food, sadly, wasn't impressive. For starters, even though I asked for an everything bun, they gave me a potato bun and by that time, I was too hungry to argue with them and send it back, so I just ate it. The potato bun was so doughy and and the burger itself was average. The thin cut fries would have been good if they weren't dripping in oil and soggy beyond belief.

So, I would only ever come back for those mushrooms, and really nothing else."}
{"text":"I just got a double cheeseburger and fries. The fries were good. I thought the burger was one of the tastiest I've had in a while. The service was good. I will probably eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have attached two photos to my review. I've been to this location a few times now. Today, Sunday was a strange experience. I ordered my American Burger along with an order of onion rings. Normally the bun is a bit warmer but it was almost ice cold , as if pulled from a freezer 10 minutes prior, or the Buns were pulled from the refrigerator immediately prior to putting on the burger.

I received 6 onion rings that were completely burnt to a crisp. It looked like either they were overcooked or somebody took some onion rings that were sitting around and put them back in the fryer for an extra few minutes. Either way they should have never been served.

Definitely not what I'm used to as I typically receive a dozen onion rings which is about $5. Having worked in fast food and having been to this location to several times, I'm used to getting quality onion rings. 

The first 6 onion rings they gave me were so bad that when you squeeze them they literally broke into tiny pieces. Ever seen when paint breaks apart into small chips? Same idea. 

There was a Young gentleman who was awesome and he offered to bring me six more onion rings to replace the ones that were burnt and you can see those ones look like they should have in those photos I took.

They were fresh. Kudos to him for being so understanding but I don't know what the people working in the kitchen were thinking. Perhaps they should focus on  preparing food instead of casual conversation. 

The gentleman at the register was very professional. As an aside, To be paying almost $5 for 6 fried to a crisp onion rings is ridiculous. 

Please train your kitchen staff to be consistent, there should be a specific number of onion rings for each order and they shouldn't all be tiny, some big and some Medium as well as small ones.

If onion ring orders are  supposed to be by weight, please keep the weight consistent because it seems like everytime I go here it's always a surprise when I get my onion rings.

 I've never had a bad experience with any of the cashiers. It just seems like the kitchen crew needs some retraining. I have attached two photos, one showing my original order with the burger and onion rings and another showing the second set of onion rings that were brought out. 

If this review helped you give.  Give it a thumbs up and be sure and take photos of your order."}
{"text":"I ordered a fry and a beer before a movie. I got the worst looking and worst tasting fries i have ever seen. A person next to me received there fries and they looked delicious. Thank you giving me the bottom of the barrel. I realize this is only a review of the fries and service but it sucked. I am never coming back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever seen at a restaurant.  All the employers were walking around barking orders at guests in a very rude manner.  This included the manager.  I will certainly never be back here and I am sure that goes for the 15+ other guests that were here.  Don't bother with this place..."}
{"text":"Burger was just okay, it had little flavor.

Onion rings were big and very greasy.

Cost for meal was about average for a burger place.

For a mall restaurant it was very average."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. This was my very first visit and I was impressed by the way manager was cooking alongside the workers at the grill!!  Plus the young ladies at the reverser were patient as I decided what to eat. And the area was clean. I will be revisiting for sure"}
{"text":"Almost didn't eat there because I saw reviews on here (when trying to find the menu). Very glad I did! Great food!! Amazing for a food court, actually! Burgers were a little small compared to Five Guys but bigger than Mcdonald's. Bacon was bomb! Jalapeños just right. Manager was super friendly... Fries were really good- skinny shoestring style. Plus, beer on tap or wine.. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Dirty space, inattentive cashiers and the fries for 2.99 were smaller than a small McDonald's fry.

Only saving factor is the burger tastes good."}
{"text":"Mo' Burger is a casual fast style burger join located in the Arizona Mills food court, operated by Villa Enterprises (Villa Pizza). Since beer (tap & bottles) and wine are served here, there is a shared dedicated self serve seating area for Mo' Burger and Villa Italian Kitchen customers, no alcoholic drinks can leave this area. There is also counter seating with two flat screen TVs above the kitchen area window.

The menu offerings include single, double & triple hamburgers and cheeseburgers (American, cheddar, pepperjack or Swiss) served on choice of potato or everything bun, fresh cut fries, onion rings, wings, fried portobello mushrooms, nachos, Pepsi fountain drinks, (self serve), and desserts (frozen custard, piecretes (pie slices with frozen custard), shakes). The burgers are made with fresh not frozen certified angus beef. This burger place sort of reminds me of the Union Burger chain, locations mostly in Ontario, Canada, though that chain also offers chicken sandwiches and veggie burgers.

While shopping at Arizona Mills, I stopped for a lunch break in the food court. I decided on Mo' Burger. I ordered a single burger ($3.65) on an everything bun (onion, sesame, poppyseed) topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, fried onion straws, & chipotle ketchup (no charge for those toppings) and I also made a combo (add $3.19) with fries and med fountain drink. The food was prepared to order and ready in about 7 minutes.

The food I had was quite good. The single burger patty was cooked well done (slight dry), which the fresh flavors of the beef and toppings and soft chewy bun went well together. The shoestring fresh cut fries were crisp and a bit greasy. Overall, a pretty good burger lunch in a food court."}
{"text":"Three for beer at the mall. Two for the food. One for the wait for the so-so food. Was at AZ Mills with a friend. All the lines were long, but this one had beer. So we had burgers. They were \"okay\". Just average. But like 20 mins waiting. Greasy fries. And WAY EXPENSIVE. Two beers, two burgers with fries almost $40. I was looking over at the $5 special next door, jealous. I mean, you're at the mall. It's supposed to be fast and cheap, right? So, if you want a burger, go out and get a good one. And lots more beers."}
{"text":"It was yummy burger.  I got the single patty and they had various free options to include.  It had the right taste of a grilled burger and a good flavor on the meat.  The everything bun was also a great addition.

The fries are thin, but they were good and plentiful.  We would try this place again but next time get a double meat burger!!"}
{"text":"I had the mo Bacon and onion rings the burger was good  and the onion rings were ok just a bit to greasy and the onions were not cooked all the way overall a good experience !"}
{"text":"A little pricey, it depends on what you get. Specific things are low priced, just need to look at the full menu and not just one screen like most people do. I love the Mo Bacon and Onion Rings. They core a full large onion and only make them when they get an order so they are always fresh and hot! A few of them come with sauces and some you have to ask. All regular condiments are completely free (don't know why anybody has said they aren't, they are on every table) ranch is the only thing that is extra for a condiment unless you get it on your burger. I rarely get the piecretes just because they are a very filling dessert, but they are very good."}
{"text":"I came here with some co-workers when we left a meeting and could not decide on where to eat.... i.e. where better to go to than a food court where you can get whatever you want in one place. I decided to try this burger joint. Service was ok... I could barley hear the attendant and they all were very short and curt in their conversations with customers. I did like that they had it set up to where you could eat either in their little restaurant area, or in the food court.
The burger was a good concept, but not well excecuted. It was a burger with guacamole, pico de giallo, and nacho doritos. The only thing excecuted correctly was the doritos... they added a nice crunch to the burger that did set it apart from your standard burger. The bun was a good bun to hold up to the burger. The meat itself, was overcooked... to the point of desert dry. The flavor of it was OK enough to where if there was more than 1/2 a teaspoon of pico de giallo and guacamole it would have been bareable. The sauces actually were good, but even on a well cooked burger there was not enough of them.
The fries were just sad. They were not crispy on any way and not seasoned in anyway. They might as well just gave me the raw potato.
I do not plan on coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"They have great burgers. The fries are terrible and are expensive in comparison to other fast food restaurants. The menu screens are broken, and there isn't a good indication of price. Service was good, however."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a 3 star because despite the LONG wait, EXPENSIVE prices and cold buns, the burger was actually pretty good. I got the basic single with jalapeños and it was tasty. My husband got the bacon burger. 

The wait was ridiculous and it wasn't even busy. I could've sworn there were 5 guys in the kitchen but all were standing around except for 2. 

The menu looked decent priced but it added up. You end up paying as much as you would at a sit down restaurant. 
The burgers were small and the buns were cold. :/"}
{"text":"Cold unseasoned French fries, flavorless burgers, overly priced for what is being offered. No thanks. Never again. One and done. But the setup is a nice idea."}
{"text":"Oh... I absolutely love this place... The MO Bacon Burger was AWESOME... Took my taste buds for a trip to Disney World... and the Service was awesome..."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and will be the last. The customer service was horrible and along with the food. Cold soggy fries are not really my thing. The cashier didnt act like she even wanted to do her job, barely even spoke to us. It seemed like we were bothering her. Dont even get me started about the burger ordered the Mo Crunch. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here. The srvices was horrible. They messed both of our burgers. I got one with two kinds of cheese, mushrroms, banana peppers with everything bread. The only thing they remember was banana peppers everything else was wrong. I sent my burger back twice and still couldn't get it wright. They also forgot my bfs cheese and added a bunch of stuff he didn't even order. Some girl with short hair was no help at all was kinda rude. I could also see other people around us sending their food back too."}
{"text":"Though I realize the holidays is a stressful and busy time, quality customer service, even mediocre is necessary. The management is a grumpy Scrooge of a fellow. He gave glaring looks at most of the guests and clearly hated life... And his job. If you're planning on eating here, think twice.

The two stars are for the hard working employees sweating away in front of the grill. Kudos for their hard work and patience to work with a Scrooge."}
{"text":"Good food for a food court. Fast and friendly staff! Lots of food for what we paid. They also have adult beverages!"}
{"text":"Stringy greasy fries and the meat on the bun was 1/4 size of the bun and had to ask for something that actually fit the bun. Paid $10 for crap. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is good!  I was in the mall and felt like a good burger so I went here. I got a double with cheese bbq sauce, ketchup, and lettuce and an order of onion rings. Everything was delicious! The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was because it only came with 6 onion rings, and for almost $4 I thought that wasn't enough. Overall a good place though."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a burger not expecting much from the reviews. My taste buds must be really easy to please, because the burger I had was BOMB. Juicy, packed with flavor, and tender. Great bun and the sauce was really good. I also ordered the deep fried portabello mushrooms. SHUT. UP. Delicious. And that horsey sauce. Yum. It's a bit pricey, but worth it to me."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time right when they opened at 11am. We were immediately greeted and once we let them know it was our first time, they explained the menu to us. They offered four specialized burgers which were all double patties. They had a special combo for the day as well. Last but definitely not least, you could create your own burger. This is what I chose. Got a single patty and added onions, bacon, cheese, and fried onions. Fries are ordered separately. We ordered one and were able to share it. Service was fast and the burger was delicious. Thin patty with good flavor and the bun was tasty. The fries were thin cut and just the right amount of crunch. They came and checked on us and took our baskets when we were done. Overall, an excellent experience and we will definitely be back. Oh yeah, for two burgers and one order of fries, about $17. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Wow not even close to what was expecting. Looks great as you walk up, staff was friendly enough. However to pay 13$ for a limp burger drowned in mayo, partially under cooked meat, soggy lifeless fries and a bottle of water I sadly would have gotten a better meal from McDonalds, (and not a McD fan). I posted what remained of the lunch I'm throwing in the trash as well as a picture of a delicious looking burger that they show but apparently do not serve. In conclusion   It's edible but not good my 2* was generous. Happy eating!"}
