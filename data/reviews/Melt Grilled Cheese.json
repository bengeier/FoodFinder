{"text":"TATER TOT POUTINE  Don't know why tater tot poutine got taken off the menu, but this shop is my favourite for that specific item.  Unfortunately because it isn't on the menu anymore, newer workers will be hesitant about making it.  Also, best veggie gravy in the city as far as i'm concerned."}
{"text":"We went to Melt to grab a quick bite before the movie across the street. It's WAY less expensive and way yummier than the crap that they sell at the theatre.   There were so many yummy choices & they had me at avacado & chicken. They have an assortment of sauces too, I opted for the mustard aioli and I swear it was homemade. If the other sauces are as good, I can only imagine.   It's worth noting that they had gluten free bread which was really good - not an easy task with gluten free bread. The size of the bread was a big smaller but it in the end, it was the perfect size.   I noticed that they have poutine (made the correct way WITH curds) that looked pretty good.  We stood and ate our sandwiches inside because it was raining but it was a very small eating area. I would suggest getting it to go (perhaps smuggling it into the theatre :D)   **this place makes a mean sandwich and is super cheap (and clean) ** Go while it's still new BEFORE they have line-ups out the door. It's really only a matter of time :) **"}
{"text":"My friend May had Melt's grilled cheese sandwiches at Beerfest a few weeks ago and absolutely raved about them. So we went by tonight (my first time). They look pretty good but my problem was with the preparation. For the 15 minutes or so we were in there the lone server seemed overwhelmed by the 6-7 orders and made the sandwiches very....very... slowly.  And the highlight was, although he took cash several times and made sandwiches several times, he didn't wear gloves and never washed his hands in between. Not even when he had a few minutes downtime between orders. Eww!!  Seems slightly expensive and slow for a grilled cheese but otherwise not a bad concept. *addition* the franchisee is addressing the problem. And like I said earlier, my friend has raved about them since Beerfest so I'm going to give this location another try."}
{"text":"I eat here when I go to the movies. The grilled cheese sandwiches are good, not great but good. The price is fair and the staff is amazing. Such friendly staff makes the long wait for your food tolerable. It's not a good place to order from if your in a rush. I've only ever been in the evenings and there's only one staff in there. They're pretty busy with orders from food delivery services. Even if your the only one there expect them to prepare someone else's meal before yours."}
{"text":"Last week as I was passing by I decided to try this place out...Big mistake. The place looks ok nothing special. I had not been there before so I took a min to look at the menu. The guy behind the cash was less then friendly and came off as he just wanted me to hurry up and order. (There was no one behind me in line) I decide on trying the the tattooed chicken and mac and cheese bites. He asked if I wanted crispy chicken or grilled.  I asked for crispy.  What I got was terrible. The chicken was cold. The breading on the chicken was mush.  It tasted like old cold chicken nuggets with some melted cheese.   The staff did not seem like they knew what they were doing. The girl that made my sandwich kept asking the guy on cash if that was enough on my sandwich before putting it in the grill machine. The guy on cash without looking said yah. Another guy working the deep fryer made a miscount on my mac bites and the girl who was not sure how to make my sandwich a minute ago said loudly \"how many are you giving him.\" It turned out it put 7 instead of 6 in the box. She dumped them out and made sure I only got 6. (Not a big deal to me if I got 6 or 7 but did not need the dramatic way she handled it.)  The only good point of my visits was the young guy that package my meal up was very nice and polite. He had to ask me a second time if it was to stay or go because their system was not putting that info on the receipt.    End of the day cost me just over $15 and my sandwich was so bad it ended up in my dogs food bowl.  No way would I ever go back there again."}
{"text":"way better lunch options around... boring and undergunned on the sandwich insides..."}
{"text":"I've been to the Richmond location a few times over the course of the last six months or so, and I feel the need to comment... The sandwiches are okay, but they have the potential to be great if they put more cheese on their grilled cheese sandwiches, after all, they are grilled \"cheese\" sandwiches. Overall, they are pretty stringent on the toppings, which hinders on potential of the sandwich to be great. I'm tempted to ask for double of everything on my sandwich, even at the extra cost, just to see how the sandwiches would turn out. I once asked for extra cheese, and the counter woman responded, \"Extra cheese?\", surprised that I was asking, as though there were enough... NOT the case at all. In short, I make better at home... I won't be going out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the Mac attack on sourdough and it was very good and cheesy. Definitely kept me full. They keep a steady line (location is very small). There's a small bar to eat but don't count on grabbing a seat. Friendly staff. Quick service."}
{"text":"Discovered this by accident and really enjoyed my Breakfast melt sandwich.  Fresh bread and cheese with a fried egg.  Very small inside there are only 3 window seats, so if you want to enjoy your sandwich out of the cold on a snowy February day, chances are you are going to stand.  Also there is no bathroom available, which is strange for a place that sells food.  If you want to wash your hands before you eat, you're SOL."}
{"text":"Nothing great about their grilled cheese, it was bland, but their poutine was even worse.  Cheese curds were rubbery, kept squeaking as they were rubbing against my teeth,  gravy was white and watery.  Would not recommend it to anyone.  Save your money!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Was recommended by a friend.  Staff behind the counter was very friendly and very helpful. A nice menu, and you can't really get grilled cheese at a lot of restaurants. They were helpful in preparing something vegan for one of our party. Different cheeses would be a nice addition."}
{"text":"Great spot exceeded my expecting had the Toronto tuna and it was delish just enough of everything.  Lots of free toppings so I added tomato.  The staff were friendly.  I saw the girl making a milkshake which looked awesome but was to full from my sandwich will be going back next time just for the shakes as they were huge.  Check it out won't be diappointed.  On a side note the place was really busy when I went by at about 130 on a friday"}
{"text":"On July 28th, after much coaxing from my boyfriend, he convinced me that I should give your restaurant a second chance. I immediately regretted it when I received my meal. I once again ordered a porky pig poutine, and once again I was extremely disappointed with the \"food\" I was served. In the past, we would visit Melt on a weekly basis (if not two times a week), and the service was extraordinary. The woman who always made our food made it with care, ensuring it was made to perfection. It kept me wanting more. On the 28th, sadly, my poutine was even more of a disgrace than last time. It looked and tasted more like baby puke than food (I do not know what it tastes like, but can imagine what I was served was as close to it as you can get). The pulled pork was made with no barbecue sauce, and it was a pale grey soggy mess that tasted like it was merely unseasoned pork water, there was little to no gravy, the cheese curds were a giant lump on the top, and there wasn't a piece of bacon to be found. Once again, if I could give negative ratings I would. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this or any branches of the melt restaurant."}
{"text":"Grabbing a sandwich before seeing a movie at Scotiabank Theatre. The menu is tight with melted sandwiches and pouting but the prices are great.  Two fold out tables with chairs outside allow for you to eat on site but this is really for take out.  Good option for the expensive entertainment district if you are watching your wallet. Great for people watching too."}
{"text":"This place is close to my bfs work. Very good sandwiches. I had tuna, he had pulled pork. Both delicious. Very friendly staff. Would visit again"}
{"text":"The only thing that melted was our hope in customer service.  Got turned away by the girl working there because \"she was closing in 5 minutes\".  Unable to rate the food, only our dashed hopes and dreams."}
{"text":"Great customizable grilled sandwiches. Beef bacon available which is hard to come by. Very decent poutine for suburbs too. Very nice owner."}
{"text":"What can I say. For the price you are not full or even nearly full. I can spend $10 to $15 elsewhere and have better food. Not to say that the menu is not funky cause it is. I just cant justify the prices based on what I was getting,. Won't return. Not like dt cheese joints at all. MORE CHEESE PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.   1) Explicit rap music blaring loudly.  2) Employee who was obviously new who DID NOT WEAR GLOVES WHILE MAKING  OUR SANDWICHES.  3) Hoard of young tweens making our experience awkward and unpleasant.   Will not return.  Ended up chucking food in garbage."}
{"text":"Thought this would be a good place to bring my little kids for a quick meal.  Very small place, couple bar seats at the window, but that's it. Had a classic, a tattooed chicken and some mac and cheese - came out to $20.  For what it cost, it was \"fine\" but pretty underwhelming - literally exactly what I'd make in 3 minutes at home...some shredded cheese slapped on some decent bread, couple really basic toppings (bacon, tomato, etc) and away you go.  I've been to similar places that a more \"upscale\" - brie and pear, gouda and apple, etc....this is not that kinda place - but if you're looking for a good ol' fashion brick cheese + white bread kinda \"classic\" this spots as good as any."}
{"text":"Sandwich is pretty good but I honestly could make it at home. Staff was horrible. Kid was more interested in his phone than making a quality product. Don't waste your time. Buy a sub."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for months so I decided to check it out today.  I tried the chipotle steak sandwich on sourdough bread.   They slow grill the sandwich which resulted in a great toasting and even melt. The steak was slightly too chewy for my likely but was tasty. The grilled onions were very tasty as well.   Overall I enjoyed it and will probably try it again. However I find it took be too pricey for what you get. I paid $7.79 for this sandwich and don't feel the quality and quantity justifies the cost.   I'd recommend you to give a try but it's nothing special for the price."}
{"text":"Really unsure why this place has accumulated so many 4 and 5 star ratings. My experience was mediocre at best. Came here on a Saturday night because we were looking for something to eat after we watched a movie (at Scotiabank Theatre right across the street). Luckily, service was friendly and there was no line.  Along with grilled cheese, they also serve soups, poutine, fries, other sandwiches, etc.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich on sourdough bread with 'grilled chicken' as an extra. Paid $8.46 - more pricey because of the chicken. Best part of the sandwich was the bread - can't screw that up right? At least the cheese wasn't 'processed' cheese. Chicken was on the undercooked side. Looked like the pre-packaged cutlets you'd find in frozen food dinners. (Turn off)!  Moreover, they only had 4 tiny bar seats facing a bench table. Not good for groups.  Would I go here again? Only if I'm really hungry before/ after a movie. Really not satisfied for a place that has the words 'grilled cheese' in their business name.   Just make your own at home!"}
{"text":"Good comfort good at a reasonable price. I just wish it were open later on Fridays and Saturdays. It'd be a perfect post-drinking meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing good food for a good price. A good menu. However the picture does not reperesremt what you get at all. It's a lot smaller all thought it's good"}
{"text":"Good sandwich place. The hog heaven was very good with a nice sauce and the multigrain bread had god texture. Friend had the godfather which was excellent with nice ingredient.   We had regular poutines which were good. The shoestring fries surprised us but had a good flavour and texture or \"mouthfeel\" as my friend described it.   Recommend trying."}
{"text":"First off, the pictures you see on the website are highly misleading.  They look nothing near that size.  Been here twice now.  Had the Bacon Avocado and the Tattooed Chicken.    Each day they have a \"sandwich of the day special\".   I took advantage of this deal both times.  The tattooed chicken sandwich was REALLY good!  But it was pretty small...for an $8+tax sandwich.    If you want something quick to fill a slight hunger, check this place out."}
{"text":"I usually stop by Melt Grilled Cheese for lunch on Tuesday's because they have the classic on special for $3. For an extra $2.99, you can also add fries and a drink. This location is very small and can get pretty busy around the lunch hour, so going at an off-time is better if you don't want to wait. While they have a couple of seats in the restaurant, it's definitely more of a take out kind of place. The sandwiches taste great and are a good value compared to some of the other sandwich places in the area. I would definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Prices are hard to beat, large portions!!  We really like this place.  Daily specials."}
{"text":"Had tattooed chicken and chicken club.  Great experience every time I come (four times).  Place is reasonable and the quality of food is legit.  I will be coming here again.  These other posts may have been isolated instances?    Ps there's no music while currently sitting here.  Only the tv is on."}
{"text":"I was a little frustrating looking for a place for lunch last Sunday, and I stumbled across this place, so I thought to give it a try. When I opened the door, the place was completely empty, maybe because it was on Sunday afternoon. They offers free WIFI, and unlimited refill soft drink fountain, so if you don't want to hangout at a coffee shop, this can be an alternative quiet place.  On their menu, they have over 10 different kind of grilled cheese with different combination of breads. Since I don't know what to get, so the guy recommended me their best seller, Tattooed Chicken. It contains bacon bits, herbed tomato, mayo, cheese, and chicken. You have an option to get crispy or grilled chicken. Again, the staff recommended me crispy. Am I wrong listening to him. The piece of chicken was not a real chicken. It was just a thin slice of processed chicken which felt like a compressed sponge. I was a little disappointing even though it tasted alright overall. If I got the grilled chicken instead that could be a different story.  Anyway, that's only one item on the menu. I am sure there are better items. They also offer different kind of poutines as well. If you are a big fan of grilled cheese, it is worth to give them a second chance :)"}
{"text":"I'm a Humber College student, so Melt is a satisfying option close by the college. In order to keep this review organized, I'm simply going to list the pros and cons.   PROS  - Friendly, personable service  - Besides the 'Classic' grilled cheese, the only other sandwiches I've had are the Tattooed Chicken and the Godfather. All three are great, quality grilled cheese sandwiches. My favourite, by far, is the Tattooed Chicken.  - Weekly deals and student discounts.  - They have a vast selection of dips in large squeeze bottles along with take-out cups so you can choose whichever sauce you want and take as much of it as you'd like. My favourite is the garlic mayo, which is a great compliment to the classic grilled cheese.  - Fairly well-sized sandwiches. The classic grilled cheese may leave you wanting more, but get a more substantial sandwich and you'll be totally satisfied.   CONS - The restaurant has a garage door-style storefront which they open in warmer weather. The big problem with this is that the fountain pop machine is situated right by it. I've never been there when there hasn't been at least a few bees flying around the fountain pop machine. It's really uncomfortable.  -The fries are a joke... nothing more than frozen shoestring fries like you'd buy in a bag for $2 at the grocery store. However, they go nicely with the roasted garlic mayo dip.  - The more complex sandwiches are a bit expensive. A premium sandwich with a small fry and a small fountain drink is going to run you about $12.   This is a great place to settle a grilled cheese craving, but there are better options out there."}
{"text":"I came in late at night with a friend, The grilled cheese is ok, the man behind the counter making it is extremely rude. He burped when we first got there cause he's drinking a coke. Not impressed with service or friendliness or the quality of food. Could make better grilled cheese at home. Xo"}
{"text":"Working close by, this place is a godsend.  Freshly made sandwiches and sides make for a quick and cheap lunch option.  While not the healthiest of foods, there is a quality to the ingredients that can only be applauded.  My go to is the classic grilled cheese and tater tots.  The staff seem to happy to be there, and I never have to wait more than a few minutes for my lunch.    The price is right as well, the grilled cheese on its own is perfect at only $5.  Tater tots and a drink come to $10."}
{"text":"Grilled-cheese sandwiches are my go-to comfort food so I was ridiculously excited when I discovered Melt.  I ordered the \"Mac Attack\" which consisted of deep-fried mac & cheese embedded in a hot grilled-cheese sandwich and slathered in spicy ketchup. The ketchup was more tangy than spicy but still enjoyable. The sandwich was exactly as you'd expect; hot melty cheese stuffed between two pieces of thick, fresh bread. Yum! For the food I would give Melt a solid 4 stars.  The atmosphere however left something to be desired. I get that it's supposed to be more of a take-out than eat-in place but if that's the case then just don't have chairs at all. The four stools at the window are cramped and the whole place felt greasy. It was also very clear that the employee working at the time felt they had better things they could be doing with their time.  If you've got a craving for grilled cheese, I would definitely recommend Melt, but take it to-go and eat it in the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite to eat.  The place was small with limited seating. Ordered the chicken club with bacon, chicken, cheese and some greens.  Description looked really promising but execution was poor.  Ingredients were fine.  The sandwich was overwhelmed with this white  sauce which was way too creamy.  Chicken was some processed meat - gross!  This was edible but definitely won't be going back!  One star for edibility."}
{"text":"Had the grab n go special (a classic grilled cheese with a side of salad, soup, or fries, and a bottle of water), which was approximately $7 after tax; deliciously inexpensive.  Will certainly come back for more grab n go, or the daily specials!  Jessica, who has been working at the location since day 1, cares deeply for the establishment and the overall brand.  She was incredibly patient and even helped me narrow down what kind of grilled cheese I wanted [by asking a series of questions].  Can truthfully say that I've never had a food related service experience where that happened, haha!    In short, this place has great deals...  and Jessica is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want a quick and easy lunch. When I first entered, I was greeted with very friendly service and it continued until I finished the last bite of my sandwich. This place has their special of day, which you must take advantage of. There are many options of bread, free toppings for diners to create their dream grilled cheese sandwich. My sandwich was made with a lot of effort and it showed with every savory bite I took.  I would definitely visit this place again and try their other specials."}
{"text":"\"What an awesome idea - a spot specializing in gilled cheese. As soon as my coworker recommended this tiny joint, we made plans to visit it. A great location too - right across the movie theatre on Richmond St W. An orange oval with a bold slab serif typeface, the branding is really not memorable and neither the rustic wood glued on the glass. However the food made up for any disappointments. There are quite a few options, including a poutine section and milkshakes...\"   This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"Based on the location it already deserves five stars. It's an alternative option, a quick joint for dinner before your 70mm IMAX experience at Scotia Cineplex aka Paramount, where they sell typical concession foods for $20 a combo. They need more and better seats for those that want to enjoy their meals here.  Visited twice, once before an IMAX film on a weekend, and once before a TIFF screening. Service was fine both times, only a single worker making food and handling cash, also barely any line ups despite being such a small restaurant. They are consistent as food served at their Mississauga location tasted the same as this one.  Can't complain much about poutine and cheesy sandwiches as they tasted good and werent very expensive. A much better deal to fill your appetite before or after the movies if you are in a rush for time. They should have more quick service restaurants near this block, aside from the sit-down chains like Jack Astors, Milestones, etc."}
{"text":"I was recommended to try this place from my coworkers and I was not one bit disappointed. Whenever I go, I always get the Bacon Avocado and Poutine. The cheese and all the flavors just melt in your mouth.. Heavenly"}
{"text":"We came here after a movie on a Tuesday night. We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. There is a special on Tuesday's for the original for $3 which I thought was great value so check that out before you order.  The place is a bit cramped but there is some place for seating.   When we finally ended up eating the sandwich, it was about 30 mins after it was made. We were worried that it would start breaking down but it tasted pretty good. There was a good balance of cheese bacon and chicken. I'd be interested to try out the avocado sandwich if I happen to be in the area and watch a movie."}
{"text":"This place is utterly disgusting. One person working and complaining about how she hates her job. The fries were uncooked in my poutine and the kale salad had brown kale. Didn't know kale was brown?! Awesome. Anyway the service was enough to make me never go back."}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised at the food just because of the location I didn't have high expectations. But the food was pretty good. The portions were filling too.  We ordered: Tattooed chicken (day special) Tator tots poutine (the backstabber) Reg grilled cheese (student special)  I found that the student special filled me up really well. I was able to add cucumbers, spinach and tomatoes for no extra cost! Sadly no choice of bread just white bread =(  My BF really liked his chicken sandwich. I think the portion was really good for him since he was really hungry. You have a choice of multi grain, sour dough or white bread. The fact that this location has tator tots makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Service was slow and disorganized.  Atmosphere was loud and uncomfortable with unsuitable trance music playing.  Best part was when they were putting the food together.  They take the sandwiches from the grills and place them in the baskets.  The lady that was placing my sandwich noticed a small piece of bread stuck in the grill.  She looked at it, didn't know where it came from and put it in my basket with the sandwich.  Really?  However, the sandwiches were very good.  I tried the morning breakfast, bacon avocado and the mac attack.  All were very good but the fries were horrible.  I wanted to try the chipotle steak but they ran out of steak...  Overall this was not a good experience.  Despite the sandwiches being good, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Incredibly underwhelming.  I've heard about Melt's other locations for a long time now and was super excited to find out that there was one opening in Mississauga. It's a bit difficult to find, as it does not have a street-facing location. It's located in one of the strip plazas in Streetsville.   I ordered the Godfather grilled cheese sandwich, which consisted of cheese, chicken, prosciutto, pesto, spinach, and balsamic glaze.  Expecting a mammoth-sized sandwich (especially at nearly $10 for a grilled cheese), I was initially disappointed to receive a puny sandwich that was pressed flat instead. Already, the Godfather did not live up to its name.   Taking my first bite solidified my first impression - I could barely even taste the different fillings and instead could only taste the cheese melted onto some generic bits of chicken. Meh.   I'm not sure why my expectations were so high for a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich place - maybe I was setting them up for failure. But all things considered, I would choose a lot of other places over Melt when it comes to spending $10.  On a positive note, Melt is one of the few, if not only, gourmet grilled cheese places in Mississauga. It adds variety, and as a huge supporter of local businesses I can get behind it.   They're also open (very) late on weekends - until 3am.  Give it a shot, but temper your expectations. It should be fine.  I'll definitely give them another shot."}
{"text":"Way too much mayo.  If this place is going to be a grilled cheese place - let the cheese do all the talking. Not a mountain of mayo. The guy behind the counter was nice and I wanted to like the place...  But my tattooed chicken sandwich was just a mess of mayo.  So much mayo!! Who needs that much mayo? Unless you needed the sandwich to lubricate a rusty door hinge. I'm sure it's great for all the wasted club goers at 3am. They need the mayo to soak up the Smirnoff ice."}
{"text":"just grilled cheese, nothing fatastic. the dips were good but the poutine really was not good. wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Well I've only ever had home made grilled cheese the two pieces or bread and a slice of cheese so this was the best I've ever had. I ordered the bacon alvacado. I was a little disappointed when I noticed how small the sandwich was. This is more of a quick lunch or light snack. It tasted great with tons of cheese and onions but I can't believe the price. It was just over eight dollars. Way too much for something so small."}
{"text":"They used to be much, much better. New owners at the end of 2013 and it's progressively gone downhill.   We've been here 4 times since the ownership changed, each time hoping they were just going through growing pains and that it would get better, but it hasn't.   The cheese used to be real sliced cheese - and you could choose which kind you wanted (cheddar, mozzarella, jack ..) now there's only one choice and that choice is a pre-shredded blend. You can even taste the cellulose. I don't know why but somehow the cheese is always chewy and melted, but cold. I miss the days when I'd walk away with my mouth scalded from the gooey melted hot cheese.   And what's the point of wearing gloves to make my sandwich if you're going to use that same gloved hand to take my money, give me my receipt, and handle everything else that's in your eye line?   We used to be here at least once a week after school, but I doubt we'll be back. It's not worth the expense or coming away smelling like we dined in a deep fryer."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd store for this company http://meltgrilledcheese.com/ and my 1st visit.  Was coming in from the freeway and got on the Lakeshore around 1:30PM and Starved. Didn't want fast food or sit down. This place was the perfect compromise.  I got the Monday Special which was a Grilled Cheese BLT on Asiago Bread for $5 My friend got the Hog Heaven sandwich getting Pulled Pork for $7.50+  The flavors and price point were better than Grilled Cheese in Kensington but the sandwich still skimpy. However, the daily sandwich specials make it more appealing.   I'd go back when I'm in the neighborhood for the flavor and for a Sandwich special on Mondays (BLT $5) and Saturdays (Hog Heaven $6) Staff was very pleasant and they accept credit cards and Interact. (Grilled Cheese in Kensington does NOT)"}
{"text":"I love anyplace that has more then 2 varieties of good breads to choose from! I got the yellow fin tuna on the multigrain bread with avocado spread.  I was really hoping for slice avocados, but a speed is better then nothing!  The bread was nice and toasted!  Since I don't eat salt, for me it was a little too salty! Not sure if it was the tuna or the avocado spread, So I only ate half of a half. But it was as a nice portion.  Oh and there is a tv!"}
{"text":"Staff were extremely rude. The sign said they were open but they were closed and after I opened the door, the staff cursed and told to leave. Not an establishment that appears to be seeking business."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick bite, although there are only four seats by the window. I'd recommend the bacon & avocado grilled cheese on multigrain bread - just the right size to be satisfied, and quite delicious! They are also on every food delivery app."}
{"text":"Not too shabby...we ordered a classic and a tuna melt. Both were a'ight, nothing terribly special though. As far as grilled cheese restaurants go, I prefer the Construction Site."}
{"text":"Very happy with my first lunch there. I got a veggie wrap, and it was like a salad disguised as comfort food. It felt light and healthy but satisfied my craving for grilled cheese too!   At $4.50 for the wrap, I would say it's awesome value and I will definitely order it again.   I used the Ritual app so I skipped the line, which I would suggest."}
{"text":"It was worth the visit, but a solid meh really. Some interesting takes on the classic grilled cheese and lots of options, but slow, apathetic service. It may just be teething problems with a new place, and that's fair, but overall, I have to be honest, it's not somewhere I'm going to race back to."}
{"text":"Usually come here late at night, after the bars.  sometimes busy sometimes just right.  It used to be from other owners, which i loved more.  Now the sauces are extra charges :(  But the grilled cheese hits the spots.   Its Grilled cheese done quickly, nothing great , nothing bad.  It does the job!  Also any place that has tater tots is a-ok to me.  Not much more you can say if you need grilled cheese after a few drinks, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Like many businesses in the area Melt is gone...."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome grilled cheeses and it's halal,  it's family owned and very very good food,  get it to go or stay and enjoy"}
{"text":"I was expected some interesting cheeses......nope, just cheddar and mozzarella, the cheese was quite poor quality. I expected more variety. The \"avacado\" is not slices as you would expect, it is some kind of processed guacamole product. To be fair, I did not realize this was a fast food chain. When compared to others in the same category such as subway and chipotle, it is quite comparable."}
{"text":"Their Mac and cheese grilled sandwich was pretty good. They need more combos and food options on their menu. Place is also really tiny so there's barely any space to eat in."}
{"text":"I remember stopping by Melt very shortly after they first opened and being fairly unimpressed by their offerings. I had ordered a grilled-cheese sandwich and was dismayed to discover that some of the cheese was unmelted. (Ironic, no?)  Given that I walk by the place on a daily basis, however, I figured the time was right to give Melt another shot. Maybe they got over their opening jitters and cleaned up their act?  Not so much.  This time I decided to go with one of their wraps: the Siracha Chicken Wrap (\"Cream cheese, cheddar, tomato, onion, chipotle & sriracha\")  It's not great.  It's actually pretty small, which wouldn't be an issue if it were otherwise delicious. But there's really not much here that works; the chicken has clearly come out of one of those pre-cooked Costco packs, the veggies were soggy, and the cheese was so sparingly applied that it was basically non-existent.  Let's put it this way: I ordered a similar wrap from Tim Horton's a few days earlier and that one was vastly superior.  It's inexpensive, at least."}
{"text":"I was in Streetsville looking for something new and I stumbled across Melt Grilled Cheese in one of the strip malls in the area.  Not very visbile from Main Street, but located on behind one of the local pubs.  The location is an average size (15-20 people seating) and the order counter and it looks like it is a pretty new location.  I have heard of other Melt Grilled Cheese locations but this is the first I have seen.    The food:  What can I say..its a grilled cheese.  Add 2 pieces of toasted buttered bread, cheese and various toppings and suddenly its almost 10 bucks for a sandwich (tax in) . I ordered the Tattooed chicken (supposedly the most popular item) Chicken, cheese, bacon, herbed tomato and mayo.  I had a choice of grilled chicken and crispy.  I chose crispy and what I got was 2 chicken fingers in my sandwich.  If I go back the grilled option is what I am leaning towards.  They do have other options on the menu, such as deep frled mac and cheese and poutine.  I did try the poutine..which was an option in my combo meal ($3.49 extra) the taste was average.  They did have free refills for fountain drinks and they also had free dipping sauces in a variety of flavors.  I recommend the garlic mayo and chipotle.  Melt Grilled Cheese was alright....if your really craving a grilled cheese sandwich, then this might fill your need."}
{"text":"A tiny little shop on Richmond, the lady who served my food seemed to be the only one working there, so it was quite busy for her. But despite that, she was still very friendly and nice. They have an extensive menu of comfort food and they definitely load up your meal with lots of cheese.  The food tasted great. Their panini presses are so cool too, how they open automatically when it's ready to avoid burning."}
{"text":"Since I was off to watch a film at Scotiabank theatre - Melt was the place of choice to grab a super quick bite before heading in to Catching Fire.   This place is a take out joint - there really isn't that much seating open if you want to sit in & dine.   Pricing is ok - not terribly expensive but not completely cheap either - I would suggest checking out the board for the daily special. Tuesday was the classic for $2.50. My movie companion ordered the pulled pork grilled cheese (I forgot the official name) on ciabatta bun and I ordered the bacon & avocado on sourdough.  Food assessment - These sandwiches are filling. I want to say I really wanted to love my bacon avocado - mostly because anything with those items in my sandwich makes me feel like a kitten that just fell in a fresh bowl of cream. But in this case, I felt like the sandwich completely missed the mark. I was filled; but the 1/2 sandwich that I ate just was missing that little bit of special.  Movie companion said the sandwich was good; but also not really completely stand out.   Other offerings include soup, fries; poutine; their backstabber poutine sounded interesting and quite a few people ordered it while we were waiting for our food. They also offer vegan gravy for those who need it.   Overall - not a bad place to grab a quick meal and off to the film - if you are in the neighbourhood that is and happen to be walking by."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly Cheese and my husband ordered the chicken club with bacon. We shared a classic poutine. My son a small side of fries and three small fountain drink. All this came to $34.96.   The place was bigger than we thought. It was clean even coming at around 2 pm. They had tables at the back and a booth at the front. When we went the place felt cold and slow.   The food was ok. The individual making it, didn't really look like she cared too much about how she was making the food and took a while before she could get the order finished. She spent most of her time talking smack about what she didn't have in the place, when the place is busy and the pet clinic down the street order one sandwich over the phone that was apparently a waste of time - especially during lunch hour. When the person from the pet clinic came to pick up her order-this server girl rudely told her she will no longer take orders over the phone for one sandwich.   For the price we paid, the food wasn't amazing. The place wasn't amazing and the server was terrible.   It is one thing to have issues and discuss them with your co-workers or whoever. But when you do it in front of customers, it makes the experience terrible."}
{"text":"Tried them first at Project X GLB event and I was blown away. This goes far beyond grilled cheese.  Sandwiches are exploding with a variety of options. Try the pulled pork!  Would have given them 5 stars but tried their breakfast offerings and they were not of the same calibre ....they don't sell coffee ( really? No coffee with breakfast?) and staff was super grumpy. Nothing like the evening/weekday service they normally have."}
{"text":"I went in here twice now and both times my order was messed up. First time I asked for no onions, and then burnt my finger tips picking out the onion slices (can't really wait for a grilled cheese to be cold, it defeats the point). Second time I asked for no mayo and, surprise surprise, there it was. I wanted to gag, I hate mayo so much. I even watched the girl take my order and then not even talk to the person making it.  Also 2 something for a fountain drink?! No thanks. Sandwiches were bland (tried two different ones) and not worth the big price tag. Would rather spend my money getting a burger from Harvey's."}
{"text":"I promised a friend I wouldn't write a two page review about this, so here goes.  I had high hopes for Melt Grilled Cheese, but it seems I'm spoiled by better experiences in the past. I've been to Melt a few times already, and I knew what to expect, but the food is just not great.  Really not great.  I have big eyes and poor impulse control, so in the past I went for things like the tuna melt loaded up with jalapeno havarti, tomato corn salsa, and shredded lettuce, with a milkshake on the side, of course.  I was quite let down.  My friend suggested going for the Tuesday special, $3 for a classic grilled cheese.  As the saying goes, once bitten - twice shy; but I figured that I can't go wrong with a basic grilled cheese with no accoutrements.  The grilled cheese was passable, at least they got a decent melt, but the tomato bisque I got as a side tasted really underwhelming - definitely store bought, maybe frozen and defrosted - and the parmesan, don't get me started.  The mac and cheese side was OK, it tasted like a basic mac and cheese, pretty middle of the road, but at least not bad.  One slightly redeeming feature was the tater tots.  I don't even like potatoes, but I found these quite interesting, and that's probably why I'm not being as scathing as I'm sort of tempted to be.  I kept wanting to like Melt, but I'm approaching the definition of insanity - trying the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.  Save yourself the trouble, please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love me some grilled cheese and drove out here just to satisfy my craving.. Pretty expensive for a mediocre product, though you do get dipping sauces of your choice with the sandwich. Won't be making the drive out again."}
{"text":"An alright grilled cheese. Ordered the deal of the day which was a classic grilled cheese and added avocado and grilled chicken and of course saracha. What turned me off about this place was that stuff kept falling out of my sandwich in between assembling and grilling. On the grill, it seems like the equipment was broken because it kept opening half way through with one half of the sandwich and ingredients sticking to the upper half of the grill. It turned me off so much that I almost did not want to eat my sandwich."}
{"text":"Jumped in here to get a sandwich for lunch. Service is great and sandwich was delicious. Not really a place to sit down though, more a take-out."}
{"text":"Was disappointed to find the fryer wasn't working, so was unable to try poutine or fries. Ordered a couple of classic grilled cheese sandwiches, a kale chicken salad, and a milkshake.  The sandwiches were fine, but nothing remarkable. The kale chicken salad appeared to have neither... absolutely no kale or chicken (despite paying $1.99 extra for the latter) and it was quite small for a large salad. The milkshake was ready about half-way through our meal and tasted fine.  Service and decor were meh. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"After catching a movie at the Scotia Theatre walked in here for a greasy, home cooked grilled cheese sandwich, right off the bat was disappointed! I ordered the regular on the garlic bread which they were out of, they were charging extra dollars for extra toppings, so I just settled for a basic grilled cheese on white bread..which with tax and all was $15.00 and tasted like card board!! I bet my parents cat can whip up a better grilled cheese then this place and the saddest part is grilled cheese is what they are \"known\" for! I give this place a must Skip on the west side!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see the sign go up. Who doesn't like grilled cheese and milk shakes.  I went in and looked around. Not much character or warmth, more sterile lacking any feeling to the place. I asked for a milk shake. The girl asked what flavor, I said vanilla. A man, I assume the owner who was on the phone, reaches back while still talking on the phone and mumbles \"do you want this?\"...a Nestlé vanilla milkshake in a bottle. I said no and told the girl to continue making a real milkshake. She then takes the nestle milkshake bottle and proceeds to open it with her MOUTH!!!! They don't use milk in their milkshakes, they add nestle milkshake bottles plus icecream plus vanilla syrup.. ok I'll see how it turns out.  She was obviously new as the milkshake in the blender was going everywhere. she finished and said to pay at the end. The owner, still on the phone rang my order in while still talking to whoever on the phone. The staff were young and just needed some guidance and training. The owner should open his eyes and help his staff do their job properly and show a little heart for his new business. Sad because it has potential. I don't see this lasting long, sorry."}
{"text":"So good. This a good place for a quick bite.  There's several different breads, cheeses and toppings to choose from.  Don't forget about the dipping sauces! There's probably a dozen different dipping sauces as well. I usually load up on like 6 different kinds to try with my sandwich.   Only odd thing about this place is that it's always scorching hot inside. Not that I mind, I just sit outside or take it home with me.   They're open late for a post bar run as well."}
{"text":"Im female, 31. I went here cause it looks like some unhealthy indulgence. I guess it was just that.   The sandwhiches are with a bunch of random ingredients and you could truly make it at home.  Same with the poutine.  Though the poutine wasnt hot enough to even melt the cheese curds.  We had one with beef amd it looked like leftovers.  We had the banana nutella milkshake which was blended so u couldn't tell it had nutella.   We had the Toronto Tuna and Mumbai Express. We paid an extra $1.99 for crispy chicken to be added, which was two chicken fingers stuck in the sandwhich. The Mumbai Express had a lil cilantro chutney which was an interesting twist.  The restaurant is between a no name indian restaurant, neighbourhood bar, and barber and hair salon.  A lil random.   If you feel like eating junk, and you're in the neighbourhood its a unique restaurant to try.  The food is alright."}
{"text":"I tried the BLT ... great sandwich at a very affordable price (they have daily $5 deals). Their selection of FREE dipping sauces are also very good. I will definitely be back to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome grilled cheese.  I had the tattooed chicken.  It was VERY tasty.  I was disappointed that they no longer have tater tot poutine.....but to be honest, I couldn't have eaten it with such a large sandwich (OK, it was a bloody hot day on June 20th, so I had a medium peach smoothie beforehand (!))  So probably, if I hadn't done that, I could have had their regular poutine!  The cook was awesome, I think they outta give him a raise.  He recommended the tattooed chicken, and he was right, it was great!  Damn, I gotta remember to take pics!  I gotta say, I'm very disappointed that they don't have a washroom.....what food joint doesn't have a washroom?????  Work on this please Melt..... seriously!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind when it comes to halal restaurants.  I haven't come across another halal grilled cheese sandwich place.  Melt Grilled Cheese serves only halal food.  We had the Chipotle Chicken Avacado, Tattooed Chicken, and the Chicken Club. Our side item was the poutine with pulled beef.  And our drinks were the milkshakes.  All delicious!  They also had a great selection of sauces for you to help yourself to.  Friendly service.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It sucks that this place shutdown, they had pretty good grilled cheese. If you are still looking for an amazing grilled cheese, try Hooters. Hands down the best I had"}
