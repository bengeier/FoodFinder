{"text":"This is as of February 13, 2015 and Cibo E Vino has been reopened about 10 days after being closed for a major remodel and expansion. My wife and I visited the Restrurant for dinner and unless it could be attributed to being Friday the 13th, this place should have remained closed. The decor was pleasant, but that was the extent of the good comments. The waitress for our section had 3 to 5 tables. Everyone experienced the same thing. Our waitress was so poorly trained she couldn't enter an order in the computer. The service was horrible. Our silverware was filthy and had to ask twice for replacements. We ordered bruscitta as and appetizer. The cost was $8.00 which seemed fair until it finally arrived. It was very small 1/8\" slices of toasted bread served with a small bowl of what only could be described as salsa. Our entrees were cheese ravioli and a Vodka Penne. The portions were generous, but that would assume you would want to eat it. The Penne had proschucta that was dry like jerky. There were spaghetti noodles mixed in with the Penne and the taste was not good. Bar service was really slow and everyone in our combined sections felt better going to the bar ourselves. Granted they had been open only 10 days or so, but to have every aspect of the dining experience that bad, I don't think it be open for long. I hope they  turn it around, but I've been to plenty of newly opened restaurants that would run circles around this place."}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced with TERRIBLE customer service. I've given this place 3 chances, and EVERY TIME my food was 30 minutes later than I was told. (Pickup orders.)  The staff here is unbelievably slow and rude. Don't support these ripoff artists."}
{"text":"Very sad.....Waited for 40 minutes for our food. The chef/cook had not even started working yet for the day. He came in the door and we decided to leave. Nothing is worth waiting that long and our food wasn't going to be done for a long time at this rate."}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari, I think. Indistinguishable cold crunchy things with cold marinara sauce. Could not have been a quarter cup of squid flesh in the entire order. Next. Steamed clams. Passable only because we are in the desert. Next. Prime rib sliders. COLD and on a bun the size of a golf ball. Is roast beef and prime rib the same thing? Next. Shortrib sliders. Same buns, excellent flavor and texture. Thought about ordering a couple more until my wife saw the short and curly sticking out of one of the petite sandwiches. That's right! not a scalp hair and not   a color indigenous to either of us. I know this is making you hungry. Showed it to the manager and was assured we would not have to pay for the order. Free stubble!!! Okay it happens. We ordered Vodka Penne with sausage and meatballs to split only we decided to share the same bowl because there is a TEN DOLLAR charge to split it for you. Now you might think the pasta and freshly thawed, still cold meatballs and the luke warm sausage (one well done and the other  ????) would have come with the requested Vodka sauce ore even on the the pasta with the same sauce. Nada. Pasta with 2 separate cold plates along side with marinara sauce on the 
meat dishes. The drinks were pathetic and it was still $60. We really wanted it to be at least acceptable. Cute place. We could take our muttley with us. close to home. However, we prefer our meals hot and hairless. Do you think the owner knows? Our waitress/manager was very nice but not as concerned as you might think she would be."}
{"text":"This location has been so many different restaurants in the past, so I was very excited when it went in because the menu actually looked delicious and the atmosphere was very quaint....much better than it had ever been. The first few times I went there, the food was delicious. I was so excited because we don't have alot of choices for good food out here in our hood. 
However, the quality of the food has continuously gone down hill (but I keep going because I keep HOPING). After 2 attempts at dining in, and 3 attemps at take-out, I am finally resigned to throwing in the towel. The food is just not good. Example: once I ordered the baked italian sub sandwich. Half the ingredients weren't even on it. I had to ask the waitress to bring it to me on a plate while I put together the sandwich myself. Ridiculously small side of fries....there were probably about 10 fries which were completely overdone. Another time I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce. It was so spicy, I had to drink 2 glasses of water!! And I eat jalepenos so I'm not a whimp when it comes to hot food. 
There is always some ingredient 'forgotten' (usually the ingredient that made me order it in the first place) or too much grease or not enough sauce and it's just slopped on the plate. 
Let's talk service.....oh boy.....I have seen the owner in there numerous times. He is always scowling, seems very stressed, which makes him appear very unfriendly. If someone complains about their meal, he cops an attitude. Sometimes he leaves his wife in charge. Once when she was in charge, my take out order was completely messed up when I got home. I called and her response 'what do you want me to do about it?' And that was not really a question if you know what I mean. They have, also, hired very young servers that are unmotivated, unorganized, and unexperienced. The service is really terrible. The last time I was in picking up take-out, someone came in from the patio asking for her server. She said a bunch of waters had been spilled. I listened to the cashier tell her server. The server said 'oh ok', and just kept on looking at a pile of papers. The woman finally came in and asked for a towel herself. She was handed a napkin. The woman looked at them in disbelief and said 'that isn't going to come any where near cutting it'. You could tell she was frustrated. Believe me, I could go on and on about the service, but I won't. Just save yourself the time, aggravation, and money, and don't eat here. I'm sorry Cibo E Vino......I REALLY wanted to love you....I gave you many chances but you just don't seem like you care......."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here.  There are better Italian restaurants to go to.  Most of the staff are young and not customer focused.  We had spaghetti with marinara sauce.  The pasta was gummy and sticky and the marinara sauce was very spicy and made what was already bad worse.  We also had the penne with vodka sauce.  This had no flavor at all and had very little sauce on it.  No bread was served which is odd for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I was contacted by Christina Olson the General Manager today. She invited us in for a complimentary dinner and took great care of us. I am so happy that we were able to eat here, the food is amazing and the staff that was working was amazing as well.. Definitely try the Tuscan Risotto. For sure we will be back. Thank you for turning this into an amazing experience, can't wait to have dinner here again"}
{"text":"I decided to go here for date night with the hubby. I was excited it was so close to my house and the menu looked awesome !! Luckily it wasn't busy so we got seated right away the atmosphere was pretty and kind of romantic. We decided to start off with the mussels for the appetizer, I was shocked when it was put down on the table there was no mussels inside the shells almost like they were cooked to the point of having nothing left, likely the broth was somewhat decent and the one tiny piece of bread that came with it was all we ate from the bowl
Of mussels. Then when it was time to order Literally everything I wanted from the dinner menu was either sold out or out of stock so I finally decided to go with the shrimp scampi it was actually very good and very filling. My husband got the sea bass and he really liked it. So overall it was a good experience But the other day when I received a flyer at my house that they now deliver I was really excited about it so last night I decided to call to place an order for delivery, the lady who picked up the phone sound like she had no idea what I was talking about so she put me on hold but hung up instead so I called right back and she said they did not have a delivery Guy working there tonight she told me to please hold so she can ask her manager if they could find someone to deliver tonight, the manager yelled very loudly we do not deliver after 3 PM I mentioned that was nowhere on the flyer but the way he was so rude and yelling I decided to just say thank you and hang up. I cannot believe a place that serves $30 plates will not deliver after 3 PM that makes no sense to me who wants a $30 lamb or seafood before 3PM !!!! I just don't get it!! So so so disappointed!! I even called all my friends and family to let them know they now deliver and we can order from them for our dinner parties but now that's not even an option. Oh well I won't be calling them or going back any time soon, they need to learn some customer service especially when answering their phones!!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good here, but the service is something to be desired.  We do keep coming back hoping that that changes soon."}
{"text":"One and Done.  Our first visit and our last.  Service was OK but the food was just blah.  Vodka penni was bland.  Asked for some marinara sauce to help the flavor and again - NOTHING.  There are too many other places to go.  It does seem to be popular, but not for us."}
{"text":"Love their lunch slice, best deal in Scottsdale. Dinner specials are wonderful.  Great outdoors section."}
{"text":"As a native NY'er, when it comes to food, Italian is probably the food I hold my standards the highest. With that being said, I went into Cibo E Vino with my eyes wide open especially after my husband raved about it and knowing the owner was originally from NY.  We went in for lunch and had pizza and wings. Wings were good and the pizza was good. Huge portions. Pizza could've been tastier and been cooked evenly throughout. It was doughy in the middle. I've had better here in AZ. I was though impressed by the extensive menu and look forward to going back for dinner."}
{"text":"This is close to our house and have had a bad meal in the past. Well they renovated and I guess need to make some extra
money to pay for it.  We ordered a pizza to go and paid $18. for a 12\" pie that was average. Also, when I try to pay with cash they had no $ in either register for change so  went back to my car for a credit card.  Food too expensive for what you're getting, won't be back."}
{"text":"We gave Cibo a try after a year away due to poor service.  The food was good but again service was terrible.  The only thing our waitress was trained to do was apologize for forgetting to bring bread, salad.  Once our meals were finally served she never came back to the table until my husband flagged her down to get our check.  It will be our final try.  They really need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Save your copy of your receipt and note your tip and total! I noticed when the payment cleared the bank, it was for more than I left. Both ours and our friends' were changed by someone at the restaurant to increase the tip. Called and the manager will reimburse it, but we won't be back.

Atmosphere not very good, otherwise just so-so."}
{"text":"I was prospecting in the area and John, the Chef was walking around passing out their Spinach Rolls with marinara sauce to the local businesses. He offered me one gladly and I was happy to accept. The rolls were mouth watering! The dough was fresh, the cheese and spinach delicious, and the marinara was so flavorful! 

A day later I ate there again and had a slice of pizza. It was inexpensive and huge! The pizza melted in my mouth and I finished the whole thing. 

The staff was friendly and I like the family-owned atmosphere they have and open kitchen. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to go back; I am glad they are in my territory :)"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after hearing from a neighbor that it was good. I ordered chicken marsala and was totally disappointed. the chicken was sliced thin but was so overcooked it was as crisp as a potato chip. The sauce was yellow thick and too sweet. It was not like any marsala sauce I had ever had. I love mushrooms and they are so much a part of this dish, I got one slice of a mushroom and that was it. I actually thought they had given me the wrong dish and the waiter stated that this is our chicken marsala. How you get a thick yellow sweet sauce from marsala wine is beyond me. My husbands lasagna was a 5 on a scale of 10. The lasagna at whole foods deli is better. I moved here from the New York area and I know the Italian is not the same but this was bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the worst dining experience I ever have had. We went with friends to have a bite to eat and some wine. We waited 40 minutes to get drinks for three of our five people, and ten minutes later the owner came to deliver the other drinks. He told us that our waiter was having a \"meltdown\" so he (the owner) brought the other drinks  Thirty minutes after that no one had revisited the table for food or additional beverages.  When two of us went to the bar to speak to the owner about this situation, we were told he had left 15 minutes earlier, leaving an incompetent staff in charge. The calamari we ordered tasted like frozen calamari in a package. The rest of the food tasted pretty good, except for one main entre salad which contained the base core of a lettuce head, buried within the salad; it was not supposed to be there. There were only three other tables being served so it was not busy, but the overall dining experience was so unbelievably poor, that it gives dining out a bad name. No one, even the owner apologized or offered to comp anything for the acknowledged poor service and I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Our $155 tab was not cheap and extremely overpriced for the quality of service, wine and food. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"The \"food\" here doesn't resemble anything other than an oil slick. Their \"pizza slice\" bears absolutely no resemblance to the famous and popular Italian dish. Many folk in the kitchen, but service was still dire"}
{"text":"This was our second time having food at Cibo e Vino, the first was take-out, and this time we actually dined on the patio. Both times we have had very good food, so I am not sure what the deal is with the negative reviews. 

When we ordered take-out, my husband had the calamari, which was quite good, and we both had the pizza.  I am in love with Grammy Rose pizza, which is loaded with eggplant, ricotta, tomato, garlic, and basil. The crust is thin, but not too thin where the crust can't hold the toppings. My husband had the vodka penne with chicken. It was delicious! 

A couple dining beside us had one entree come out and it was cold. She asked for it to be warmed up. The manager/owner brought it back out afterwards and said he would take it off their bill. That is excellent customer service!

We actually brought our dog with us and they were fine with her on the patio. They even brought a little bowl of water for her.

We are very happy to have this little casual Italian eatery in the far north Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I've been twice-the food is so-so, the service was good the first time and REALLY bad the second time. In fact, it was so bad, we probably won't go back. We were the only table in the place and the waitress still couldn't be bothered to refill drinks without us asking first. The floor and surrounding tables were dirty and flies pestered us throughout the meal. yuck. The patio has dead plants in pots as decoration. I would like this place to succede, I really would, however, the owner needs to put a little more effort into ensuring that the customer has a good experience, because right now, it appears that that no one is interested in repeat business. They bother to advertise and provide coupons, but even a great coupon won't make a good experience."}
{"text":"We hadn't been in a couple of months and decided to use a great coupon they sent to us. Everyone was very nice - The bread & salad was very fresh and the pizzas were great. I didn't get the Lasagna this time but I've had it before and it is really wonderful too. I recommend Cibo E Vino, it's a pleasant place to eat! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited Cibo twice within 2weeks. My first visit we had a few mishaps with the waitress and our orders, but overall we decided the food made up for it. The homemade breadsticks were in the iven and would be out shortly. We got them adter our salads. Oh and the calamari we ordered came out with entree because she forgot to put the order in. Hmmm? Very good calamari, chicken picata and cannoli.  So we considered to give it another chance and brought friends with us the following weekend. 

Arrived at 6:30pm. Waitress/bartender suggested calamari happy hour for 4 (nope not enough for 4people).  Much later salads arrived (no fresh bread sticks as promised -in the oven)same excuse as the first visit. Salads gone and then finally the bread sticks came then we waited, waited, waited for our entrees. Mind you only 6 occupied tables in the whole place. What was the delay? Who knows! The bread was fantastic though. So a bottle of wine was purchased while we waited. By around 8:15we recieved entrees. All the meals were pretty good. Sea bass, lasagna and the lamb was excellent. 

I think the kitchen is not focused on time management and even though the food is really good, we just dont have that kind of time to wait around for a complete dinner experience.  6:30-9:15"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start?  We were with a group of people and everything that was ordered was incredible.  We had the gnocchi, risotto with braised short ribs and the pistachio crusted sea bass.  Pepperoni rolls were amazing too.  Such a great experience and the service was impeccable.  Would definitely dine here again and would recommend it to anyone looking to have an authentic Italian dinning experience."}
{"text":"Really had high hopes. Went before closed was good enough to go back. Will never go back. Waitress doesnt know what an IPA is? Spaghetti for $20? Raised prices to pay for remodel, ok but have food to make up for it. Chicken on the salad doesn't even look real. Bread undercooked. Hate eating out for $$ when I can make way better at home. Daughters birthday and all disappointed. Cheesecake factory would have been better. Sorry to see this place won't make it. Agree with all other reviews. Beautiful but 3 out of 10 in food department.

Wife just reminded me, strawberry chic salad use to be so good. She said what happened to good grilled chix from before?? Daughter said they downgraded chix like other restaurants do to pay for rent. Bingo!!

Warm beer wife put ice cubes in it. My drink? Zero carbonation. Flat as can be...gross. I want to support local businesses, wish I could support this one. Remodel hit 10 stars, rest, gut it, staff, food, drinks. What happened to the Ripasso wine? Where is the owner?"}
{"text":"I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars because there is usually something I can pick on but Cibo e Vino does everything right.  The food was truly spectacular, my wife had a white pizza and I had the lobster ravioli and both were simply wonderful.  But that's not why I am giving them 5 stars.  The restaurant is small and quaint with an open kitchen which was very clean.  They have added a few things to the patio that has made it so beautiful and comfortable we could have stayed all night.  In just a few months (since our first visit) they have semi-enclosed the patio and added a fountain and fireplace.  The owner is always walking around talking to his customers and taking care of them and the servers were very helpful but never bothersome.  Arizona needs more Cibo e. Vino's."}
{"text":"Undercooked pasty dough and so much grease that it was inedible - that's not a pizza I want anyone else to suffer. Service is dreadful - there's usually about 6 or 7 schoolkids running the place, and nobody can answer a question, if they can be bothered to look up from their own conversation."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I come I am not disappointed! It's a nice hole in the wall Italian ma & pop restaurant. Their lunch pizza slices are really good and really huge! I liked the eggplant parm too. The owner is really nice and is always here working every time I come in- which I appreciate. The ingredients are really fresh and the staff is really nice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for date night and I'm so glad we did! Everything from the quiet atmosphere to my Fettuccine Alfredo was amazing. We started with the Pepperoni Pizza Rolls which are an absolute must when you dine here. My boyfriend ordered the Vodka Penne w/ Sausage which I couldn't help but have several bites of. The staff was extremely welcoming - the chef and owner even took the time to come out and check on us during our meal! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst!  The only reason I gave them 1 Star is that you can't give them 0 Stars.  Unbelievably poor service.  The only thing they are good at is apologizing.  But with as much practice as they must get, they should be good at it.  Never again."}
{"text":"We gave it a third try. The food is good but the service was terrible all three times!!  Three strikes you're out!!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!  We had pizza and salad.  The pizza sauce was amazing.  The crust was crispy and had a great flavor. We also ordered the Crumble Bleu Cheese salad. It had chicken, pears and walnuts and the most incredible vinaigrette dressing.  I have missed great Italian food since moving to Arizona and now I don't have to!  Love it!  As for the staff?  I had awesome service. The chef even came out and asked how the meal was. You don't getting that very often in other restaurants. I will be going back!  Thank you!  Christy"}
{"text":"Took a chance even though reviews were bad..we learned our lesson!  Poor service..my chicken picatta looked and tasted like it was precooked and warmed up before served.  Beef short ribs were nothing more than shredded beef in a purple sauce - not edible.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Neighbors liked the owner, so I tried it, twice.  First visit, for lunch; although meatball sandwich was on the menu, the staff seem befuddled over how to make it, so it took twenty-five minutes to get it to the table, it was barely hot enough to eat, and just not very good.  Second visit, for lunch again:  wised up and tried the pizza slice special.  Again, barely hot enough, doughy crust, unimpressive.  Server uninterested, no refill on drink, and I had to ask for my check so I could leave..."}
{"text":"Saw them on 3TV and decided to give them a try.  Like many other reviews, the food is great, but the service is AWFUL.  It should not take 2 hours to get some sliders!  We won't be back...  Shame on 3TV for promoting a restaurant with such glaring issues!!"}
{"text":"We at Cheetos afterward! Staff nice, owner welcoming but food took way too long to come. Salad was clans and cucumbers rubbery.  Dinner took almost 45 minutes nod was fair to poor . Shrimp was tasteless and dry. Chicken piccata was weird with some kind of creamy garlic sauce. Only benefit was rather large piece of chicken for the $18. Such a cute place and could have so much potential for a neighborhood place. Cook definitely needs more help and better lighting!! Poor guy probably couldn't see what he was cooking. Maybe the pizza was better.  Gail"}
{"text":"Went over to Cibo's on Nov 1 2012. Ordered food and had been already waiting forty minutes when server comes over to the table and let us know that an item menu that was ordered that they were currently out of!!!!!! All that wait time and then asked after forty minutues if we wanted to replace that item menu!!! Awful service and this is to include the owner that was on that night, we personally complained to him and he we told him that we will never be back as a few weeks ago we got really bad service then and  as in bring out your food that was to be hot and it was COLD and then reheated with the letttuce on the sandwich so then you have hot welted lettuce! Ew! I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone of my friends."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. Need improvements everywhere. I will give them another try next year if they're still in business. CAPEESH"}
{"text":"2 things... Great Pizza and A Friendly staff.

Look no further for a great pizza, beer, wine  or a great dessert inside or outside in their beer garden."}
{"text":"After reading all the negative reviews from fellow Yelpers about the service & seeing a \"help wanted\" sign on the door when I drove by, I decided to give this place a try.  

Probability has it, if they are seeking new servers, they must have fired the bad ones.  Right?  I have to say this is a likely possibility.  When my family and I decided to eat lunch here yesterday (Dec. 31, 2013), I believe the service has gotten a lot better (based on Yelpers past experiences).  Our waitress \"Daniele\" was on top of things & very kind.  She even had a good sense of humor when I asked for a wheelchair...  (I stuffed my face with the $5.50 giant pizza slice & soda rather quickly).

So anyway, if you're like me & want to take a risk on good food and possibly bad service but are willing to be surprised, give this place a try.  I think it deserves better than 3 stars based on my experience yesterday."}
{"text":"Drove through the parking lot and decided to \"take a chance\" and not look at the reviews. Sat a dirty table with a frenetic, attitudy-waitress who informed us that she was the only one there and it's going to be slow. Not even apologetic, more like a \"sucks for you that I'm the only one here, deal with it!\" kind of thing. The entrees were quite expensive for the dated pizza joint decor, topped with the notion that we would probably never eat (based on her warning... Sat there 10 minutes without a glance), we left without ordering. Never even got water, but the place was just depressing and I couldn't imagine spending a dinner there."}
{"text":"I had a difficult time giving this place even a single star, but had to give them credit for at least having the TVs on so we had something to do while we waited FOREVER for our food to arrive. Our server certainly didn't distract us from the wait. Her appearances were about as frequent as snow in the summer in Scottsdale. I'm not going to even get into how bad the food was - the \"homemade\" pastas were obviously prepackaged and frozen, the sauces bland and sometimes difficult to swallow. In retrospect, we should have tried the pizza, but I don't hold out much hope that the quality would have been much better. Here's some advice for Chef John: Maybe it's time to spend more time paying attention to the quality of the food and service in your restaurant and less time doing every local TV spot you can schedule. I visited Cibo e Vino TWICE before writing this review. Both visits were on weekends and the chef wasn't there either time. We were told both times that he was away for the weekend with his girlfriend. After learning that Chef John actually got free money to redesign his restaurant made me even more sad and angry at his total disregard for the quality of the food he serves, his customers and the nearby residents who would benefit from a good Italian restaurant. Shame on you. I would say that you owe me at least two free dinners, but I know it would be inedible anyway."}
{"text":"Cibo e Vino is tucked into the NW corner of a small shopping center that is anchored by an Albertsons Grocery store at the corner of N. Scottsdale Rd. and Carefree Hwy.  The atmosphere is OK, but the food is DELICIOUS.  The chef's Marinara sauce is the best I've ever tasted and the fried Calamari was crisp and not oily and also very tender since the chef only uses fresh squid and not frozen.  You can make a meal out of the ample assortment of appetizers during Happy Hour and that's just what we did.  The meatballs were huge and tasty and the pepperoni rolls were excellent.  We will be back for dinner soon.  This place may be hard to find, but it is worth the effort."}
{"text":"We happened by this place recently. Yes, the place seems to be run by 20-somethings. Our waitress had a memory problem too. Forgot a few things, even though we were the only ones in the place. Then after 20 minutes, she told me that they were out of what I ordered. The food WAS good, but what I noticed and what bothered me was the fact that it was dirty. Floor was dirty, the counter up in front looked like it hadn't been dusted in weeks...for me that is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Take out and dine in we're both not good.
Salads and pizza are sub par and staff is disinterested.
Will not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Calcium build-up on the wine glasses should have sent us scurrying, but we stupidly stayed to drink the wine that tasted as if bottle had been opened a week earlier.  Dinner was no better, other than the delicious pesto rolls.  All else was massive FAIL: insanely slow, incompetent service coupled with bland food and run-down environment.  Given their poor reviews, never would have gone but a foodie at work recommended the place.  Guess he's on my \"don't trust\" list going forward.  Please spend your hard-earned money elsewhere and just let this place die."}
{"text":"Good pasta, decent pizza, average sandwiches, and mediocre service.

I've been here a couple times for lunch with varied experiences. The food itself is typically unremarkable, except for the pasta. I really really like their vodka penne and ravioli dishes. I've tried a couple bites of their other pasta selections to much delight. The only downside is that pasta is not a good choice for lunch, unless you're planning to snooze the rest of the day. The sandwiches are OK, but I would honestly choose Subway next door for speed and affordability. They do have salad options, but every time I've ordered one, they were out of the desired fruit for which the particular salad was titled (e.g. Strawberry Salad - whoops, no strawberries in house). Though, they've always rectified the situation with an alternate fruit.

Cibe does have a lunchtime pizza and soda deal for $5, which is pretty reasonable; and, the big floppy pizza slices are good. Nevertheless, all of their entrees are pretty heavy and better suited for dinner. 

Next question - would I go here for dinner? Probably not. The ambiance doesn't really feel like a dinner joint. When you come in, there's a walk-up counter with tables and chairs wrapping around towards the back kitchen. It feels very much like an Italian diner. Also, many of the other reviews touched on this - the customer service is lacking. It's not terrible, just not great. For the price, keep on truckin' down Scottsdale Road or Pima to find some excellent dinner venues. Though, if you're in the area and craving pasta, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Short Story - Not the Best.

Long Story based on just one lunch visit.

After years of just driving by I decided to try this restaurant after reading about the ten month renovations and seeing the Chef/Owner on TV. The on-line menu looked terrific to me so I thought this still might be a good choice.

We were only the second table of the day to enter the restaurant and the table I picked was filthy from the night before with crusty dirt. For my beverage I ordered an iced tea and the glass had a lot of dried soap residue on the outside but the tea didn't taste soapy so I didn't send it back.

I noticed the menu differed from the on-line menu and what I wanted to order wasn't on the menu so I went with the strawberry salad. I have to say the produce was very fresh and very good but the chicken tasted like processed chicken. It had that lunchmeat salty taste and texture. It's possible that it could have been over marinated real chicken but it did have that processed taste.I couldn't really enjoy it because the dressing was terrible and was mostly just oil. I dreaded the thought of asking for another dressing because I doubted any other dressing would be any better so I just ate it dry. I did notice my plate had soap residue and near the end my mouth felt like it was burning. I think I ate or drank some soap or cleaning chemical.

My husband ordered an antipasto salad and a slice of pizza. I took a bite out of the pizza and it lacked seasoning and left a weird strong after taste almost like blue cheese. I don't know what it was. His salad looked nice but was only BREAD PLATE SIZED at $13.00. His salad had lots of sun dried tomatoes in it but they weren't HYDRATED and were chewy like raisins.

I do also note much of the time the cook was seated in the dining room between cooking and was chatting with our server about stuff. He looked like a hippy boy from Whole Foods and didn't look presentable seated in the dining room.

Using the ladies room was an adventure. It was clean but the stall I picked was out of toilet paper so I went to use the next stall and that door doesn't lock or close all the way. I couldn't remove a roll so I went to grab paper and it had some weird mechanism were it only allows you to use a couple squares at a time.

After leaving the ladies room the Cook (hippy boy) was blocking the hall chatting with the server and I thought I'd have to push him out of the way to leave.


I did see the 2.5 Yelp Rating and was hoping it wasn't accurate as I don't always agree with the ratings.

 Sadly the Yelp Rating for this restaurant seems very right on."}
{"text":"Well it's funny to read the previous review because they must have gotten our sauce. We ordered take out as well. We got everything we ordered but I have never in my life seen pasta dishes like this. My son ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and a side of meatballs. The portion was huge but there was not a tablespoon of sauce to be found. It was literally pasta and meat. As for the meatballs, they were gray, pale and dry. Not a speck of sauce, same for my husbands side of meatballs that came with his lasagna. Really, really odd and not very tasty. My pizza, I got the Sputnik was meh. Toppings had some flavor but a Boboli would have been better. I really hate to write this and as with the other reviewer we had such high hopes but I really think there will be another vacancy in that shopping center very soon"}
{"text":"Spinach roll was great! Love the Calamari.....berry salad was good but the chicken we added to salad needed some flavor. Kathrine was super friendly and attentive. Misters on the patio would be nice! Over all happy hour experience was fabulous."}
{"text":"Ho, Hum, another 'Authentic Neapolitan Pizza' store. No, it isn't good. Save your dollar, go to another pizza place."}
{"text":"I'm pretty new to the Carefree dining scene, but I enjoyed my recent visit to Cibo e Vino for a delicious dinner. All the pasta in the family-friendly Italian restaurant is made in house, which made me more happily gobble up each bite of my homemade meal.

My pal and I started with a fruity red sangria, which was sweet and refreshing enough for even non-wine lovers to enjoy. We began with my favorite part of the meal, baked brie, which came topped with homemade strawberry marmalade and pecans and was served with crostini ($12). This would have made a fantastic dessert, and the marmalade was a tasty touch to the bite of the cheese.  It was the perfect size for two, and I would have happily eaten a second portion for my meal.

My pal got the Black Mountain Shrimp, sautéed in butter and served with portobello mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and garlic bread ($13). She said the appetizer was flavorful and the shrimp were fresh, making it a great choice for shrimp lovers.

For dinner, my pal had the pistachio crusted sea bass ($22), which came with a white wine beurre blanc, garlic mashed potato and sautéed spinach. She said the fish was cooked perfectly, and again, the portion was generous, but her only suggestion for improvement was to make the pistachio flavor more evident. While the nut did coat the fish, she was inspired to order it because the flavor combination seemed so interesting, but it wasn't as evident as she would have preferred.

I had a vegetable ravioli featuring an alfredo sauce, with mushrooms, spinach and pine nuts ($14). The dish had a ton of sauce to scoop up, and the generosity of the veggies made for a very filling meal. I loved the sauce - it was a thick, creamy consistency, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Both our meals came with salads - my pal got a Caesar salad, while I got a house salad that was topped with sliced onion and tomato, olives and cheese. 

The salads were a nice addition to the meal, though I'd definitely recommend starting with the baked brie, for sure. The menu includes a huge variety of meat and pasta dishes, plus pizzas. Recipes come from chef/owner John Collura's Italian grandmother. 

The restaurant recently reopened this spring after a remodel that doubled its size from 2,200 to 4,500 square feet. It includes an expansive patio that has classic Frank Sinatra-style tunes playing, while the inside features several sports televisions at the bar, which is adjacent to the main dining room. There were big groups at the restaurant the night we went, and the atmosphere is relaxed.

Everyone who served us, from our host to our bartender to our server, definitely strove to provide great service, checking on how our food and drinks were throughout the night and making great recommendations on what to order. If you want to support a locally owned restaurant next time you're in the north Scottsdale area, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"My lady and I decided to stop for lunch in the neighborhood. Slice salad and soda $10. Good value. Looked in the kitchen and then up at the ceiling fan and then decided not to return. Dirty. This place has lots of potential. But the difference is in the details."}
{"text":"This place seems to be hit or miss but, we have discover the secret. I have gone there and had an amazing experience and of course the opposite as well. My recent experience was very pleasant. My wife and I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Greg. Next time we go, we are most certainly sitting at the bar. We received much better service than when we previously sat at a table. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the Italian cuisine and picked us out a great bottle of \"vino\" to pare with our meal. 

We started with an appetizer of clams and mussels. Being from the coast myself, I have high standards for seafood. I must admit, we were not disappointed. Both the mussels and clams were full of flavor and spice that brought out the natural essence with a very nice balance. 

My wife ordered the short ribs, which were excellent. My only complaint is the risotto that came with it was slightly undercooked making it a tad bit starchy. I had the chicken marsala which was some of the best marsala sauce I have had in a while. It was rich, buttery and sweet with a hint of heat. I could have used more bread to dip in it, but still very good. 

After our meal we chatted with the bar tender about a good after dinner drink. After asking us a couple questions about what we like he created us each a unique drink based on our tastes. I asked for something spicy with lime flavor that was a good sipping drink. My wife asked for something with chocolate. Greg did some muddling and prepared me a Moscow mule with fresh rosemary from the bush out front. It was so good I had to have another after. My wife's drink was more sophisticated than mine. She had a Chocolate martini that she said reminded her of biting into Godiva chocolate. It was interesting to watch him make the drink. After adding vanilla and chocolate vodka, I witnessed him put whip cream in the tin used for shaking drinks!! This is the first time I have seen a bartender do this and I was skeptical. However, I had a taste of the martini and it was so creamy, rich and sweet that I had to bow my hat to his trick. After the chocolate martini there was no need for desert! 

When we go back (which we will) we will be sitting at the bar for better service. I understand this is not an option for some with kids, but if you have the option I suggest sitting at the bar. The restaurant seems to have a very high turnover rate for servers. We have gone in probably a total of 8 times before this and had a different server all times but 1. Every time we go in it seems to be the gentlemen that took care of us tonight or another girl that I don't remember her name. She seems very nice. However, she has never waited on us.  Living in Terravita, we will be frequenting this establishment. It has a lot of potential and we hope to see it reach it's maximum capability. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a pretty good lunch at Cibo e Vino a couple of weeks ago, so when friends called and wanted to go out for dinner Friday night and were open to suggestions, this is where I suggested.

Oh, dear.

We arrived at 5.45 to take advantage of HH prices and were told there was no dining seating available on the patio, we would have to eat inside.  Bummer, 'cause it was a gorgeous evening, but it WAS Bike Week.  So we sat at the bar to have cocktails---we were told we'd be seated in about 10 minutes.  Good, we're hungry.

At 6.30, one of our DC's (DC=Dining Companion) went and lassoed the young hostess, who said \"five minutes more\".  Ten minutes later, DC went back in AGAIN and she must have been firm, because the hostess came out to collect us, only to pause and then say: \"Oh, wait, there's another table I need to seat first.\"  DC nailed her with a steely glare and the child gulped and led us into the dining room, where only half the tables were occupied.  (WTH?)

We should have stayed out at the bar and just drank.  Walking into that dining room was like walking into a wall of heat.  And there was a chemically smell---the other of our DC;s, a former builder, guessed it was whatever finishing product they used on the (very attractive) back wall of reclaimed wood.  I mean the restaurant looks very nice.  You can tell they did it on a budget, but I actually like that better than an over-the-top place (plus there are ideas I can steal, heeheehee)

Our waitress came.  We commented on the heat and she agreed: \"It's hotter in the dining room than the kitchen!\"  But I have to tell you, this young woman provided stellar and personable service throughout the night---she was a bright light in an otherwise dim evening.  

The bread that was brought to our table was good---nothing special.  Everyone was starving at this point, so we skipped the appetizers and went straight for meals.  DC #1 ordered the chicken parm and a dinner salad, DC #2 ordered The Bartlett Pizza and dinner salad, DH ordered a pepperoni and onion pizza and dinner salad and I ordered the Tuscan Risotto and Caesar salad.

Salads came out pretty promptly, were fresh, but again, nothing special.  Just nicely dressed salads, fresh, with decent dressing.

Entrees arrived in a timely manner as we finished our salads---nice pacing.  Unfortunately...  DC #2's pizza was dead cold.  On the other hand, DH's pie was bubbling hot and he said it was pretty darn good.  (Is their new pizza oven too small to bake two pizzas at once?)  So The Bartlett was sent back to the kitchen for a reheat and DC #2 urged us to go ahead and eat so our food didn't get cold.  

Like I said, DH liked his pizza.  He said he would put it on the positive side of a 1-10 scale---maybe a 6.5-7?  DC #1's chicken parm---well, the chicken was well cooked, but the tomato sauce ladled over it was very acidic---not well balanced at all, and DC #1 did not like it.  Oddly enough, the spaghetti that was the side was tossed with an entirely different sauce that was actually pretty good!  (I tasted both sauces and there was a very noticeable difference!) As for my Tuscan Risotto.  I really should have sent it back, it was so disgusting.  Look, if someone back in the kitchen had a lick of sense, it could have been a delicious dish---sausage, green and red peppers, onions, and, of course, arborio rice.  The rice was really well cooked.  Tender but with some bite.  But there was so much cheese mixed into the risotto it was a nasty, greasy mess (see photo---that yellow blob about six o'clock on my plate is a puddle of grease), and once my meal started to cool, all that cheese started globulifying and it was just...gross.  I think I ended up eating scarcely 1/5 of a $22 dinner, once I had removed enough and all that yellow-y grease started oozing.  Like I said, I should have returned it. Instead, I actually allowed Nice Server to box it!  (What was I thinking?) As for DC #2, when his re-heated pizza was brought out to him, it was now hot, but dried out.  He ate one piece and then had it boxed---he probably did what I did, which is just dropped the carry-out container into the garage garbage can when I got home.  

I am not sure why I am giving this place 2 stars, except DH liked his pizza and our server was such a sweetie.  But I probably won't go back---at least not to eat."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I take a tennis trip every year. We have now been to The Boulders in Carefree two years in a row. Last year we stumbled upon Cibo e Vino on our last day. This year we ate at there 4 (both lunch and dinner) times in 6 days. We got lucky as they just completed a large expansion adding an indoor outdoor bar. The salmon Cesar is the best we've ever had! The pizza is also amazing... We were told the owner/chef makes all the dough himself because it's an old family recipe. A great atmosphere with great staff. See you next year!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bit and got the slice and drink for $5.. fantastic pizza.. we will be back.."}
{"text":"Was there twice after the renovation..nice decor but you can't eat decor!!

First visit:

Chicken Picata..luke warm, had suddy taste. Mother had spaghetti marinara..ice cold pasta! Sent food back..came back 15 minutes later only a TINY bit better but still lousy!  We both had salads where the dressing was as thin as water..NO KIDDING..how do you screw up ranch dressing!
Decided to give one more try thinking first experience was just a fluke.
2nd Meal .. Lasanga was OK not special and not much better than you can get from a Stouffer's frozen meal. Mother ordered chicken marsala. This meal was totally unrecognizable and horrible. Again..pasta was COLD!! Both of us had salads..again, water thin dressing..ranch dressing is not supposed to be the consistency of water..get a clue.
Service was poor both times and in fact I had to get up on 1st and 2nd visits to hunt down the server for cutlery/a few more napkins, etc..

I'm not sure what's going on here but the owner stomps around and looks mad at everyone/life in general..this seems to understandably put the wait staff 'on edge'..I wonder why. The tension of the staff is so thick you can cut it like a knife. Between the poor service, poor server vibe and HORRIBLE food I will go elsewhere to eat...there are so many better placed to drop $90 (after tax/tip) and get better food in a more relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We live in Carefree /Cave Creek area and enjoy supporting local restaurants. Our server was slow, food was room temperature, soggy and lacked flavor. Very nice decor, poor service and food was poor."}
{"text":"This restaurant is dirty and is in serious need of a deep clean.  The food was good though."}
{"text":"The food, chicken Alfredo and mussels, was  fantastic. The service was wonderful and our waitress was attentive.  Everything has improved since our last visit."}
{"text":"If you love GREAT food - that is reason alone to dine at Cibo e Vino.  Our family of 5 had dinner here during a visit to the Phoenix area.  The service was great and the food was unbelievable!  The restaurant is a great family style place tucked in the corner of a shopping center.  From the starting bruschetta to the finishing homemade cannoli, the food was just amazing.  All five of us loved our dishes.  I had the Cioppino and it was outstanding.  I was surprised at some of the other reviews, but many seemed to be service related complaints, which can be hit or miss with many places.  I can tell you that even if I knew I was going to get bad service, I'd still visit Cibo e Vino because the food is THAT good!  Definitely recommend if you are in the Cave Creek, AZ area!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a round of golf with the guys. We ordered 3 HH apps. Spinach rolls, pepperoni rolls and lobster Mac.  All 3 were so good. For our main meals we ordered 2 pizzas and chicken parm. They all were so delicious. We were treated well from the moment we walked in, the service was fantastic. We had multiple waitresses and waiters check on us. Our main waitress Christina was extremely attentive. She was fun and very personable. I'd recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Closed without notice!

We have seen this place on the morning news shows for a couple of years so decided to try it. I made reservations for Friday 12/18/15. I made the reservations on 12/16. When we arrived at the restaurant the parking lot was almost completely empty and the place was not lit up. As we approached the door, we were intercepted by a security guard that told us the place was closed down. I asked \"when did this happen\", and he told me \"today.\" 

Obviously this place must have been having problems for a while to close down. The problem I have they took my reservation over the phone just two days earlier. I should have took note of the fact that their online reservation link did not work. Even their restaurant website still shows an operating restaurant with no mention of closing down.

There is no excuse for not calling me to tell me that they closed, prior to me arriving at the place and finding out the hard way. Extremely unprofessional and just plain ignorant."}
{"text":"We have been here for lunch and dinner dozens of times over the last couple of years and have never found anything to complain about. In fact Cibo e Vino is our favorite restaurant in North Scottsdale and the Carefree area. The ambiance is so warming, comfortable and quiet. The tables are spaced sufficiently so you don't feel that your conversation is over heard. The patio with the goldfish pond and the fireplace is very unique and gives it a nice touch. If you like pizza this is the place. Not only do they offer gourmet pizzas but during lunch they sell pizza by the slice and they are HUGE!!! My husband loves the Slice and Beer special and I usual order a salad and a glass of wine during lunch hour. The salads are AMAZING and the extensive wine list is impressive. For dinner they offer so many different items including duck ravioli! OMGOSH was that good. Service is always great as well. I had spoken with the owner who tells us they plan to extend into the space next door this year and will have a full bar!! We are just so pleased with this place we intend to have our company holiday party here this year."}
{"text":"First off, I am not certain why  this restaurant has gotten bad reviews as I went there with a girlfriend a few days ago and really had a good experience.  We were over at Brix's having some wine and decided that we needed real food (not just some cheese and crackers which is all they serve basically..what is UP with that??) and she suggested Cibo E Vino as she has eaten there before.  So we walked in and were immediately greeted by the chef (who I think is the owner?) which was nice.  The place is small but I guess he is in the process of getting permits to enlarge.  The patio was really pretty too but I am a weenie when it comes to the heat so we ate inside.  

We started off with the Triple Berry salad which was delicious.. . Basically, it has raspberries, strawberries and blackberries with a great balsamic vinaigrette, candied pecans (yum, I love those things I could eat them by the handful), grilled chicken, red onions, feta cheese.. it was a great combo.  Just make sure you get a little bit of chicken, little bit of fruit, pecans, salad and dressing.. it's an inspired mix. :) 

For dinner we split a slice of cheese pizza (gotta cut some calories somewhere right? and the cannoli was on the plan for the ending) and the chicken parmigiana and we split both. Two words: yum mee.  Ok, I just made that one up but it was great!  Nice gooey cheese .. HUGE piece of pizza!  Really!  We are two TINY girls!  haha.. ok, maybe not after this meal... and the chicken parm was amazing.  I am super picky about my marinara sauce.. I don't really know WHAT  I like, but I do know what I DON'T like.  This was amazing.. I could imagine it with bread just scooping it up.  The chicken was great .. pounded nice and flat and it was cooked perfectly..easy to cut with a fork actually.

So Yea..we had the cannoli for dessert.  Who knew that ricotta sweetened would be so great in a dessert? With a little drizzle of chocolate sauce and some sliced strawberries.. heaven.         

I would definitely come here again if I am back up in Carefree.. especially if they enlarge and have a bar that a single girl can eat at by herself and feel not conspicuous. LOL.. But it was really good!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here since they changed ownership. The service is ok since the place is not busy. However they did forget about my side salad. The calamari is overcooked, very dry. I ordered homemade gnocchi, added Italian sausage to it. While the gnocchi texture is not the greatest, it tasted ok. The only thing is they overcooked the Italian sausage."}
{"text":"All I can say is never again....the atmosphere is dark, gray and dingy. There is a loud humming noise that comes out of the kitchen which is smack, dab in the middle of the place....theres really no quiet place to sit.  I must say, the cheese ravioli was excellent but the pizza was not edible to our standards...it was soggy (we had ask for extra crispy) and everything fell off the pizza while eating it.   I only could eat one slice..it was that bad.  The waitress was slow but friendly.  She forgot our refills of bread after asking several times. I am all for supporting the mom and pop places but this needs work.  It was really gross watching a kitchen staff member with long fake polished finger nails putting the silverware away grabbing them from the tops, not the handles.   A little hidden surprise was the adorable outside patio that I wish were had seen (or even offered) upon arrival.  It may have made sitting there so long and the bad pizza a little more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a late night dinner. Our appetizers were great, especially the baked Brie, which came with a sweet sauce and nuts. Definitely the best part of the night! I also enjoyed the black mountain shrimp, compliments of the chef. 

By the time our food arrived, I was pretty full from the rich appetizers, but still ate some of our dinner. My friend enjoyed her ravioli. I ordered a pecan crusted fish (sorry, but I can't remember which one), which was all right but I couldn't taste the pecan crust very well. The sauce, though rich and buttery, seemed to be lacking pizzazz. 

The drawbacks were (1) loud music on the patio - so loud that I couldn't hear my friend talk (2) prices were a little high, though probably on par with your average nice Italian restaurant (3) the decor and vibe wasn't as high-end as the prices and reputation seem to imply.

If the atmosphere was more intimate and comfortable, I'd go back with my significant other on a date. Really, the food was very good, and I'm curious what else might be tasty on the menu. But I'd probably avoid the patio next time."}
{"text":"Ughh... the place was a train wreck before it was remodeled and it now looks nicer but the food and service is the same or worse. The staff is just totally disorganized and unprofessional. Everyone seems to be a newbie in the restaurant biz or is just unhappy working there. Even the chef seemed unprofessional and better suited for a burger joint. The food unfortunately doesn't make up for anything -- it's below average Italian that's way overpriced. Surprised this place reopened and is still in business!"}
{"text":"We recently gave this place another try, it is greatly improved, and the interior and most of the bar has been redone. There is some real effort at work here and the food was at least good for the most part. Unfortunately, it is very pricey here for what you get, and there are good items and bad. The service could be better here. Still, for this area of town there are very few good choices for dinner, this is actually now one of the better choices. If you took guests there for dinner, you would not be embarrassed or terribly disappointed, that alone makes it a good choice."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've never had the pizza here. But, we've been 3 or 4 times and really enjoy is. I usually get the strawberry/goat cheese/grilled chicken salad (sometimes they have raspberry, it's great, too!). I don't even use the dressing (which comes on the side) b/c the reduced balsamic on the chicken is enough to flavor the salad. My husband and kids love the mussels. Sometimes we get a cheese pizza for the kids that goes half eaten (probably b/c they've gorged on mussels and garlic bread sticks). 
The lamb and risotto were surprisingly good. We always sit outside. Oh, and I always love the music (I'm a sucker for Ella and Sinatra)."}
{"text":"Back open for a week after renovations.  We got here at 7:05, and after several follow ups on our pizza, we stil had nothing at 8:27pm. We gave them 5more mins, the pizza still wasn't done. So i  ran over to Sesame Inn (which is excellent) to try and catch them before closing, while hubs paid bill at Cibo. They ended up pulling a nearly-raw pizza out and giving it to my hubs, no Charge for our drinks, salad, or pizza.  So Sesame Inn stayed open longer, just to get food for us after Cibo wasted an entire evening of ours, waiting for a meal that didn't come.. (We weren't the only ones waiting 90 mins for pizza; they claimed it's a new pizza oven and only heats to 300' instead of 600'....but I'm pretty sure my 300' oven at home can cook a pizza faster than 90mims). Other notes of importance: the chef/owner left at around 8....and left his staff to deal with this mess. At the time he left, I commented that I hoped he'd put my pizza in before he left. We were not offered bread until 8:15....70 mins after we ordered (and after multiple complaints). The Caesar salad was average. They have no fresh pepper in the building. The bartender didn't know what kind of beers they had on tap (and we sat at the bar). Could it get better after they were open longer? Maybe, but this isn't a new restaurant. They're just reopened after a remodel...??"}
{"text":"The service started out great until we got our appetizers then the waitress completely disappeared. We sat there for 10 minutes after we had finished our appetizers with empty drinks before she came back to put in our order. When we received our food it was less then ok. The risotto was under cooked and the lamb was over cooked. Not a great combination. Great place to grab a drink and a mediocre appetizer. Would recommend for happy hour not dinner."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 min for the wrong dish and somehow it seemed that it was my fault for them screwing it up. When the right dish came,  it was below average."}
{"text":"Love this spot! My fiancé and I dined there on a Friday night and the atmosphere was truly amazing. The food was delicious! Make sure to try out some of their yummy Pepperoni Rolls. They literally melt in your mouth. We also had the Black Mountain Shrimp and man were they giant shrimp! For dinner I had the Chicken Picatta (cooked to perfection) and my partner had pizza with figs on it (a must try)! The wine was great and our server was very attentive. The chef and owner, John came out to meet us. He was born in Brooklyn and learned to cook from his grandmother.

We will be back! So great to have a locally owned place so close to us!"}
{"text":"WHERE TO BEGIN?
We received a slick and shiny full-color Grand Opening announcement from Cibo e Vino. Great food photos. Intriguing menu. Famous chef. 10 minutes from home. Saturday night dinner with another couple. BaDaBing!
   THE GOOD:
Outstanding waitperson. Superb Chicken Parmigiana. 
   THE BAD:
Upon arriving, I asked for coffee; they were \"out,\" deeming it cost prohibitive to make a new pot. It was 8:30pm, 30 minutes before their late Happy Hour started--we weren't THAT late--don't people often have a cuppa after a meal?
   One of our party requested Arnold Palmer, but they didn't have/were-out-of iced tea too.
   Ironically, there seemed no \"supply\" issues with alcoholic drinks
   Two of our party ordered Vodka Penne (\"Penne tossed in Homemade Vodka Cream Sauce, Peas, and Prosciutto\") which arrived sans Peas and Prosciutto. We alerted our server who returned with The Chef's response: they were \"out\" of the recipe's ingredients. We let her know we expected, at the very least, a discount on those dishes.
   THE UGLY:
After dinner, having received our check, we requested to speak with the manager. When she arrived, we explained A) The \"outs\"--coffee and tea and peas and prosciutto; B) that a $2 discount on a $17 dish, that should never been served, was a joke; C) We had come as a result of their Grand Opening announcement and were extremely disappointed; and finally, D) We would not be coming back. 
   Without taking personal responsibility or offering even one solution/option, she said \"I'm sorry\" and could not have cared less.
   DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON Cibo e Vino."}
{"text":"Coming from a full blown foodie this restaurant is one of my favorites after the first visit. Everything from the app to dessert. They keep it simple and accentuate the true beauty of each dish. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Although the patio was beautiful, the food was not very good. The calamari were so tough we couldn't get a fork through some of them. They  were the consistency of bamboo when chewed (I spit them out). The spaghetti was cold tasteless and mushy. The vegetables were extremely over salted and the veal piccatta was slimy.  I sent it all back. We got very good service from the general manager Christina; who apologized profusely and didn't charge us for the bad food.  My husband got a shrimp dish which he really liked; and I liked the garlic bread and my side salad, which was all I ate for dinner after trying 3 of their dishes which I couldn't eat.
Very sad."}
{"text":"Food quality is inconsistent, staff is inconsistent, wait times are long, service is hit or miss and my observation is that I blame that on poor management and I hate observing micro management by the owner over his employees while I'm trying to have a relaxing meal. On the plus side a good place to get a good slice of pizza for lunch at a reasonable price. My message to the owner is get your act together - don't be arrogant, hire the right folks and coach them to success and to provide a positive dinning experience. Also don't run to Albertson's every day to buy food - poor management from a cost base, customer perception and drives costs up for all!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went in for dinner on Sunday night and the food and service was great! Our waitress was so friendly and attentive. We split the drunk shrimp and the fried calamari for appetizers - both were delicious, especially the bread that came with the drunk shrimp and the marinara sauce that came with the calamari! Our entrees both came with house salads - the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was so good! I got the penne pesto for my meal - it had sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts, so so good! My mom got the chicken piccata - and said it was her ideal meal. It came with a side of spaghetti with marinara - and vegetables, including brussels sprouts (her favorite). Overall we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Closed.  Just drove up there today and saw legal papers on the door and \"for lease\" signage all over.  Looks like there closed.  Called the number too and no answer.  Are they going to reopen does anyone know or move to a different location?  He just spent a lot of money updating the place and making it bigger, it is a shame to happen.  Stick with those huge enormous pizzas!  Keep it small!"}
{"text":"Myself and our family frequented this place on many occasions.  Born and raised Italian I was so disappointed on my last visit.you pay 12.99 for just pasta,no meat sauce or meatballs. No bread was offered, I thought this was odd. When our pasta came out we took one bite and ate no more. It was the spiciest sauce I ever ate. Now let me remind you that I grew up having hot pepper eating contest. The waiter or greeter was told and at no time did he even try or ask to make things a little better.
This is what totally did me in . the owner was present this night as well. No customer service here. We will NEVER go back, nor my friends after this experience
Cheryl G."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food took forever, came out wrong. Could not receive drinks, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after we checked in to the Boulders Resort not far from here and, boy, am I glad we did.  The cheese ravioli is delicious, especially if you're a garlic lover!  The homemade breadsticks are fabulous and you MUST try the homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing.      Only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is because my meal was just warm when it arrived to me (my husband's meal was steaming) and became cold very quickly.  I wish we could bring this restaurant home because it would totally be in the dinner rotation!"}
{"text":"Service is horrendous.  Sat for nearly 15 minutes waiting for someone to take my order - after the couple who was seated 10 minutes after I was, received an appetizer order.  After I discussed my dissatisfaction about this inattention to my server, I was given an excuse about training in another person. Then, it took another 25 minutes before receiving my salad and at least another 10 before the entree arrived.  Keep in mind, the restaurant was about 50% full, and it was a Monday evening.  This place needs to get its act together!"}
{"text":"I don't know what others are talking about, but I loved this place. My boyfriend and I came here to for date night dinner. The place closes at 10 I think, but we loved it and if you're a foodie, it's a hidden gem! 

Give this place a chance. It's hidden and the appearance does not begin to describe what the place truly is. The food was amazing however and if you're looking for ambiance, I suggest sitting in the patio area. I was surprised. It's more casual, but intimate and homey. 

My entree came with a salad, YOU HAVE to get the strawberry vinaigrette. It's so sweet and delicious.

We got complimentary garlic bread and I'm not usually a fan of marinara sauce, but it was so tasty. It was seasoned just right with the perfect amount of garlic and butter. Usually sauces are plain and thick with nothing but tomato, this marinara sauce was heaven. My boyfriend told me I was crazy cause I kept raving about the sauce. It's savory, seasoned, and so goooood.  

I had the fish entree. The halibut was cooked just right. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't burnt and was not \"fishy\" either. It came with mashed potatoes and spinach. Also yummy. 

My boyfriend had the baked roll. He says it's like a cinnamon roll except fluffier and better. It's simple, yet soul-satisfying. 

We ended our dinner with a mousse cake from the selection our server brought out. The portion is bigger than it's tiny space. Oyyyyyy, the cake is to die for. Sweet dark chocolate shavings atop chocolate mousse with a chocolate cake foundation, finished with fudge chocolate icing.  

Please, try it for yourself."}

Shame. the food was good. John will return somewhere."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place and the food is great,
I'm so happy to have a great Italian restaurant close to home.
I've tried the lasagna.... and I'm really picky on my lasagna.... but this was some of the best I've have tasted in a long time.
Very friend service and great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses, and when I discovered that Cibo e Vino was locally owned and operated I new I had to try it.  I guess it did not help that I was staying within walking distance of the restaurant.  All I can say is that I love it, and there is nothing that I have had that I don't LOVE.  The Parmigan Chicken is my favorite, but the peach salad is a close second.  The Chef/Owner John is so passionate about what he does, and I love the fact that he is always creating new dishes.  You must check the daily specials for some of his latest creations.  I can honestly say that when someone now asks if I have a favorite Italian Restaurant I can say ABSOLUTELY..... it's Cibo E Vino!"}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time or your money. For half the price, you would be better off with Domino's - which tastes better. The only positive thing I can say for Cibo E Vino's pizza is that the ingredients are fresh... but the freshness of the pizza does not make up for the lack of taste.

Three pizzas and a batch of those pepperoni rolls (not sure the name, I didn't put in the order) and the total was around $60. A little pricey, but we were feeding 7 total, so I figured that was justified. Until I saw the pizzas, that is. \"Dainty\" is a nice way to describe them. Any other company would call them small. Flavor? It's there, but you have to concentrate to find it. If you had told me they were just using a fancy frozen dinner, I would have had a hard time disputing the claim.

The food itself is meh, but two stars seems a bit generous for a pizza place that's robbing its customers blind. At this point, I'm just going to believe that location is cursed - no matter which business occupies it."}
{"text":"Ugh. This place needs to put itself out of its misery and just close.  No. Wait.  It is already dead. We went there without reading the awful reviews first.  No wonder.  The place was empty, except for 4 people sitting at a table were the \"chef\" and a waiter and a couple ladies that kept taking their Big Gulp cups, and walking to the bar and filling them up with booze, and then coming back to sit down.  Not only that, but the chef kept bringing them food. I wonder if the owner even knows this is going on with his staff.  It was very unprofessional.  We ordered pizza and it was INEDIBLE.  It tasted like leftover pizza that was reheated and burned beyond recognition.  Even dental records would not identify it as a pizza. Knowing that another pizza would be just as bad, we asked for a to-go box and dumped it in the trash outside.  We couldn't leave this place quick enough."}
{"text":"Consistency and food quality has gone downhill dramatically over the past few visits, and it's at the point that I've given up.  On most occasions it seems like the owner/chef is not there, and the *entire* place is run by twentysomething kids.  The pizza quality is all over the place, with sometimes an enormous amount of residual grease everywhere, and sometimes overcooked, and sometimes smaller than the standard size for their takeout pies.  They've also made several errors in the orders too, which can be incredibly annoying.  The takeout pizzas are absurdly small too, well at least for the price.  Hopefully another restaurant will take over this spot in the future because the area still needs good pizza."}
