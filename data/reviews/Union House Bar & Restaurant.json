{"text":"Love the fish fry and pierogis. Very busy on a Lenten Friday when I was there, but the servers kept up with the demand really well. And the coin operated bowling game was lots of fun to play while we waited for our food. I miss the Gray Wolf, but supposedly this place has their old recipe(s). The owner chatted with us on the way out and said the pierogis are made fresh, on site. I agree with the reviewer who said that it's easy to miss. Watch for it on the South side of Brookpark Rd."}
{"text":"First time visiting. Menu does not specify which sodas are refillable vs canned. Menu doesn't say which sodas are canned, for that matter. Sodas are priced at $1.25 each shown on the menu, we got two. Price was $3. When I asked my server, I was told the extra quarter was because the servers bring it to your table. Again, that was not shown on the menu. All of this should have been explained when the server took our drink order. We both ordered pierogies, which were only editable with sour cream and the onions tasted as if they came out of an onion pack which were hard little like rice and crunchy....not fresh. I managed to eat 4 and waited 28 minutes for the server to check on us, with our plates pushed away from us. Only when a couple that came in that wanted a booth, did our server look at us and say, \"You're leaving soon, right?\" Needless to say, that was our first and LAST TIME we will visit. What a complete waste of money and time. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Dingy bar that serves delicious fried fish and pierogies.  It's cheap, good and feels like Cleveland. You can almost see Anthony Bourdain there while doing his tour of blue collar Cleveland bars.  Go, it's worthwhile."}
{"text":"Owners are very welcoming to military veteran patrons.  Nice patio, attentive bartenders, great dive bar."}
{"text":"I went here to see the Tabloid Twangers play on a Saturday night.  The acoustics were good and the table layout handled a sizable crowd.  Patrons and staff were really nice.  Not much of a dance area - room for 2 or 3 couples, but decent room between tables for getting the bar and restroom (which was clean).  I didn't eat but my wife really liked the food.  The owner talked with us briefly and seemed very down-to-earth and genuine."}
{"text":"Fish Fry on Wed & FRIDAY !! THAT IS WHAT THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT!!! giving it  a 5 star.

I get the coke.....fish...fries...bread...and coleslaw! good stuff baby! LATES!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice traditional restaurant, feels very much like a place people go for generations. The food is good and the service is too. It's always very crowded, there's a bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in Friday afternoon for the fish fry and was pleasantly surprised! The food was excellent! For $9.95 I got a large piece of cod, lightly breaded and not greasy, 2 pierogis, coleslaw & bread. Very filling! Even though it's an old building, it was very clean...I even peeked in the kitchen and it looked very clean. Oh, and did I mention that the service was good? I'm sure it helped going in the afternoon..heard they line up at dinnertime!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Blink on Brookpark and you'll miss it.  Good food - awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome atlantic cod and homemade tartar! Fish fry on Wed and Fri are a must"}
{"text":"So-so food. Friendly service. Typical bar atmosphere. They don't take credit cards though which tips the scales against them. Even the crappy Chinese place down the street that operates out of a shoebox takes credit cards now. No excuse not to even if you are a tiny hole in the wall Parma joint."}
{"text":"I drive by this place on the way to my parents.  On Easter morning the parking lot was packed at 10am.  I always wondered if there was bikini girls or a Gary Coleman look-a-like bartending..  After finally going in I still dont understand why its always packed.  Professional drinkers come here I guess..lol.  The bartender was nice, place was clean and drinks were cheap.  Not a crazy beer selection but that keeps all the uppity people from coming in, which is refreshing.  They have Keno and a claw machine for your entertainment.  I will try food next time im in and get back to ya.  I heard the fish fry is the bees knees though!!"}
{"text":"We went here to watch a friend's band play, so this review might be under-informed. We didn't try the food, but our first peek at the place left a lot of positive impressions. Union House has many attributes one seeks in a great little dive bar: The beer is cheap. The bowling machine is excellent. The servers are nice. The place is clean. I'd happily return."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you if the food was good or not. I left after being ignored for a half hour, ten minutes of it was spent standing at the bar hoping to get a menu. I wish I could give less than one star."}
{"text":"Update: Went back after all the fine reviews about their codfish dinner. It was very good and the beer icy cold. Guess I went there on a bad day."}
