{"text":"best ice cream shop in the GTA, its worth leaving the city for."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I'm reminded of the easy summer days of my childhood! Eating ice cream at Tom's Dairy Freeze makes me think of the simpler times. 

This is an unassuming place with a big selection of ice-cream and sundaes. A lot more original than nearby Dairy Queen and Baskin Robbins!"}
{"text":"Waiting times can get pretty intense, but this classic ice cream shop is a favorite of mine.
One clever fellow in line placed his order over the phone. Seemed a bit douchey to me, but it worked for him. He managed to skip about 10 people."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone goes gaga for this place. Ice cream is pretty mediocre and the portions tiny. We got the small yogurt dipped cone which was runny but okay and the small sundae. The sundae was also okay  but served in a wee clear plastic cup like the ones you get at the water cooler. Both items came out to about $8 and change which is a bit rich for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a really cool (no pun intended) old school ice-cream stand. I usually get the fudge sundae and they're very generous with the toppings. Only drawback is that this place ALWAYS has a lineup (minimum 30 mins). But I suppose that shows you how good it is."}
{"text":"Great place!!!! The burgers, French fries, and ice cream are really good and the prices are very reasonable! Easy location to find as its on the north side of Queensway.  I heard that this place had great reviews and had to check it out for myself. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because it's been an Etobicoke staple since the 60's, is always busy, family run, and is ACTUALLY GOOD!

The icecream is always delicious and they have tons of flavours.  I came here a week ago for my first visit of the season and decided to venture out of my ice cream comfort zone and ordered a burger from here after hearing they were good.  And you know what?? It was excellent, fresh tasting, and CHEAP! Try the burgers!!!

Will be back, obviously, many times in the future!"}
{"text":"The best soft serve ice cream in town! Always has lines in front of the shop, but definitely worth waiting:)"}
{"text":"The ice cream is just like store bought ice cream that being said it is quite over priced but ehh it's nice to visit on a hot summer day.

Do not come here for anything but the ice cream. The meals are just frozen costco food."}
{"text":"They have the best soft serve in toronto. When you compare it to cheap franchise places like dairy queen and mcdonalds, theres no comparison. You can tell they use real and less artificial ingredients when you taste the ice cream which is very rich and creamy. For the price they give you quite a bit. The only thing they can work on is the workers, mainly the female ones being a bit more attentive. I had to ask them 6 times for a extra spoon and it took them a while to get it. Other then that great soft serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"So today my son and I went to TOM'S. We used to go alot. So when I seen it was open again we had to stop in. What a disappointment. Last summer the ice cream truck started coming down are street. So this year we had are first one off the truck. I can't believe the truck was better then Tom's.  And cheaper. The only problem  with the truck is you have to wait for it. So I will have to see how the cravings go. I might just have to visit Tom's again."}
{"text":"Small little spot on Queensway for amazing soft-serve! When my friend pulled up to to Tom's I was a little hesitant because of the line, but it was worth the wait. Not only do they have the classic chocolate and butterscotch dip for cones, but peanut butter and a fruity flavour as well.

We got a peanut butter dipped vanilla cone and a chocolate with sprinkles. Added an order of freshly made onion rings (surprisingly good considering it's famous for ice cream), and enjoyed our snacks on the picnic tables they have set up in front of the store."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait in the long line-up on warm summer nights!  That's all part of the experience.   Delicious soft-serve and dipped cones in massive quantities (seriously, the large is ginormous).  Sundaes with hot fudge... yummm...

And last night I had my first milkshake, and it tasted just like a classic.  I'll be having that again!

Cash only, but they have an ATM on site."}
{"text":"Tom's Dairy Freeze is a CLASSIC !! the best ice cream west of Keele ... I am surprised no one has posted a review yet .... the line ups in summer are the longest you'll ever see for any ice cream parlor in town"}
{"text":"The best soft serve ice cream in the city. Creamy and the perfect balance of flavour. Also has a great steak on a bun that will melt in your mouth. I have been going there for about a decade. Another great treat is the orange and vanilla slush supreme that will remind you of a creamsicle you had as a kid."}
{"text":"Best soft ice cream I've ever had.  The food here is not bad to.  Too bad it closes for the winter."}
{"text":"For a seasonal \"ice cream joint\" this place is uniquely amazing. 

There are always line-ups (I'm talking 60-70 people) across the sidewalk and around the parking lot in the summer time. There is a Baskin Robbins and Dairy Queen not more than a 2 minute drive, yet Tom's is obviously the place to go. 

My favourite eats at Tom's is not even their ice cream. It's their steak sandwich. It reminds me of the olden day Johnnys' burger steaks. 

They also have souvlaki on a bun and of course regular hamburgers and hot dogs. 

Be ready to line up, but as the other dozens and dozens of patrons understand... it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Etobicoke!!!

I usually get soft serve which is mixed with vanilla and chocolate.
Strongly recommend to get soft serve at first.
Then try something else such as soft serve with chocolate covered...Ummmm.
You will see how fresh and creamy it is.....AMAZING.

I also tried the thick milk shakes and its also super delicious as I expected.
( You have a choice to take either Regular, thick, malt) 

It's all budget friendly, portion are huge.
So, my husband and I cannot go anywhere else for ice cream!

FYI, They are only open from March to Nov."}
{"text":"Great ice cream!

It will make you forget about the awful service at Mamma Martino's"}
{"text":"They're selling commodity-quality ice cream but with very high prices. We had rum raisin and raspberry cheesecake - single scoops. The ice cream was smooth, but flavour was artificial. Service was lack lustre. 

Cash only. And they have an ATM on site!!"}
{"text":"Soft serve ice cream was amazing! So smooth, creamy and the right amount of sweetness! Loved their ice cream! But one thing not as\"friendly\" is that when we tried to ask for a cup they actually charge you $. And the size of the cone sometimes depend on the person who makes it- therefore last time my large cone in cup is about same size as my moms medium cone- a bit upset cauz it was not that gigantic as I had expected."}
{"text":"There is not much to say about this place.  It's been an establishment on the Queensway for years.  Excellent choices soft ice cream, hard ice cream and sundaes.  The flavours for the dipped cones are chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch and blueberry.  Can't go wrong with any of those. On hot days like today (30c), it's a pretty good idea to get yourself an ice cream.  I'm even feeling for one now !"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot for old school soft serve ice cream!. I had the blueberry sundae and strawberry sundae both of which were very delicious. You can tell they use real ingredients from the ice cream to the toppings. You don't get that sugary processed flavor at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely soft serve.YUMM!!!!!! I had an orange soda soft seve float and am in 7th heaven right now  I am most definitely coming back here.   Fyi they dont take credit cards so bring cash and they have a couple of tables to sit outside but not many.  The soft serve is out of this world and they have been around since 1969 which is impessive."}
{"text":"Bought fries. Ok. Nothing spectacular but better than fast food joints."}
{"text":"What is it about winter that always leaves me thirsty and craving ice cream? Oh how I long for Tom's old fashioned, super thick chocolate malt milkshakes... Right now they're shuttered for the winter -- or perhaps still cleaning up from their yearly conversion to xmas-tree-lot -- but I'm counting the weeks until they re-open. 

This is the kind of place that only still exists on the outskirts of Montreal or rural Ontario and yet here it is on The Queensway of all places in all it's retro ice cream shack glory! 

To say that Tom's is a return to an slower, simpler time is about right, though this is the REAL DEAL -- it's been there longer then I've been alive. The walk-up window and dilapidated benches only add to the experience and their extensive menu puts Dairy Queen to shame."}
{"text":"Anyone got a good hookup for cheap insulin? Why you ask? Well this classic walk-up ice cream shop just re-opened recently for the summer season, and I live a dangerously close walk to its easy access window - DANGEROUSLY close. A walk that wouldn't even burn enough calories to allow me to eat here - who cares right?

You don't need to know everything they have, because you probably already know. Every delicious soft and hard serve ice cream treat you can imagine, ranging from a basic soft serve cone or swirl to the Brownie buster parfait delight - ZOMG!!! (That's zombie OMG - because well zombies make everything even more awesome).

What's more? They have a grill section where you can get a meal before you indulge in your ice cream fantasy. 

I can't be 100% sure but I'm almost certain that their great prices are event cheaper than Dairy Queen (which is just up the road 2 minutes).

If this summer turns out to be the scorcher that all the meteorologists are predicting then you'll know exactly where to find me. Indulging in something cool, soft and creamy (shamelessly) on one of their numerous picnic benches.

SWEETcrest OUT! (yep - I went there)"}
{"text":"I've been to Tom's multiple times and always have positive experiences. The last time I went might be the last time I ever go. I have a severe allergy to peanuts and I am always cautious of what I eat everywhere I go. I ordered a chocolate dip twist with sprinkles. My usual order. When I got my order, I noticed 3-4 peanuts mixed in with the sprinkles. I told the guy who made my cone that I found some peanuts on my cone and about my allergy and he told me that if I have a nut allergy I really shouldn't be having anything from their menu at all. No apology, no offer for a new cone. I told him I never had an issue before and this was the first time I found peanuts mixed in with my sprinkles on my cone. I kindly asked if I could have another one without sprinkles (because obviously there is some serious cross contamination going on). He gave it to me without hesitation, which was nice. I understand that some cross contaminations are unavoidable, but I believe this one certainly is. There are many kids with severe allergies to peanuts and nuts and I would rather it be me with peanuts on their ice cream than a little child and an angry parent."}
{"text":"The best place to go for ice cream in this neighbourhood!! It's addictive and delicious and once you try this place you'll find yourself going back forever! I have tried many of their ice cream creations and they are all delicious. The hot caramel sundae is amazing and I also really like the frozen yogurt sundae with cherry topping - tastes like cherry cheesecake. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food and ice cream are very good, but the dirtiness of the tables and the general area, together with the outrageous infestation of wasps, makes this place impossible to attend!  Don't the owners see that their patrons are running around and screaming from the hundreds and hundreds of wasps?  Maybe if they took some time and cleaned the tables and area, from the months of spilled food and ice cream, the wasps would relocate!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come back here a week after they opened. Always love coming here for their soft serve so many option to choose from. They use 100% cream instead of milk.

My favourite thing to get their is the \"Cookie Monsters\" which is vanilla soft serve with blueberry dip and Oreo cookies can't go wrong with this one!

Today I got a burst soft serve ice cream with smarties kinda wish the burst flavoured tasted better but nonetheless will always come back for their soft serve."}
{"text":"Tom's Dairy Freeze  SOLIDIFIED my love for dipped cones. The reason for this is their variety of dips and combinations of toppings! Not only that I also found my love in their signature flavor bursts as well! But more into that later in the Review

First thing's first, just more about the store from my perspective. Its a little corner Ice Cream Shop with a small parking lot, I personally sometimes just park across the other plaza (not sure if I was allowed to do that) and walk over to get some yummy Ice Cream. 

Regarding line-ups, the time's I have gone, Line-ups were not CRAZY long, only because I've gone during the weekdays or non peak hours. The longest I had to wait was the line going to the middle of their small parking lot, and the wait I would say was may 25 mins. But either way I would say that the Ice Cream is well worth it!

Now to the good stuff! Like I said previously, there are plenty of Ice Cream options on the menu, but my girlfriend and I tend to hone in on the Soft Serves for the dips and different combinations. I would HIGHLY recommend the cookie monster (Soft serve Ice Cream dipped in blueberry dip and Oreo cookie topping) or even the combination of Dipped Chocolate Soft Serve with Skors toppings.
**Note** You can have any combination you prefer, we personally just looked on Instagram and saw what was pretty but were greatly satisfied on the taste of it!

But also I gotta talk about the Flavor Burst Soft Serve. What it is is Vanilla Ice Cream where the ridges of the swirls have lines of your choice of flavors. I usually get the Rainbow Flavor Burst because it gives me all the flavors (and it looks HELLA pretty). But you could get a strawberry flavor burst which coats the ridges with a pinkish red flavor.

All in all, I would at least make a visit here once a year during the summer, even though the past summer we came 6 times (give us a break, we just tried it for the first time this year XD)"}
{"text":"A must visit. Great flavours and cheap prices! Friendly staff. A bit difficult to find parking at times."}
{"text":"A delicious soft serve place just down the street from me?! HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE BEFORE?! Careful driving by, you might miss it the first time!

Frankly, I have only ever tried the soft serve... but really, that's the foundation of a good ice cream place. And they've got it down to a science. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the line up! Trust me, it moves fast. This old school fashioned ice cream joint is everything it should be! Cute, quaint, efficient and it's got treats galore! No real indoor seating but it has plenty of outdoor picnic tables (some with umbrellas) for you to enjoy a frozen treat on a beauty day or even a hot and sticky day... There's nothing wrong with enjoying something cold and sweet when it's hot outside. That's actually the best time to treat yourself! 

Oh and they also have hotdogs, hamburgers, fries... You know, those types of awesome goodies too! :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the Tom's Dairy Freeze hype... their soft-serve is great but that's about it. Food sucks. I think it's more of the fact that it's been a south Etobicoke \"monument\" for so long."}
{"text":"This is overhyped in my opinion. It has a cool 50s/60s diner vibe. The queues are so long we waited around 45 minutes and honestly was not worth the wait. It's almost impossible to get a parking space too at busy times. 
I ordered the butterscotch dipped cone with vanilla ice cream and it tasted very synthetic the hard coating. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but you can't see the menu until you have to order."}
{"text":"This place is like one of those landmarks since it has been opened for quite a while (since 1969).
Definitely a very good dairy freeze, one of the best served in the 6ix.

The business is quite visible when you driving along the Qeensway because is just right off the road and usually has a long line up of people waiting to satisfy their gluttony of soft ice cream.
But take my word for it, it is so worth the wait.
The menu offers such a variety of items that I haven't had the chance to go entirely through it.

CLASSIC CONES :
- vanilla
- chocolate
- twist

DIPPED CONES :
- chocolate
- butterscotch
- peanut butter
- blue raspberry

FLAVOUR BURST:
- for this choice, you have to ask the server for the flavours (they change from time to time) 

OTHER ITEMS:
- sundaes
- specialty sundaes
- milkshakes
- extra thick milkshakes
- super shakes
- banana split
- slushies
- slush floats
- soda/floats
- ice cream sandwich

They also serve you burgers, hot dogs and steaks but I'm not sold about these items... I might be wrong.
So, overall, a fun spot with reasonable prices and many fun, tasty treats.
If you are planning to go to watch a movie at the theatre there, leave a bit earlier and stop by. You'll thank me :)

Thank you for being open late."}
{"text":"Cute little place in a surprising spot on the Queensway!

Lines get quite long but generally staff are able to keep it moving. Great sundaes and slushies."}
{"text":"The soft serv here is really good! Creamy and tasty. I got mine vanilla dipped in blue raspberry and for the first few bites it was awesome then after the dip hardened, couldn't taste the dip flavour as much. I tried my friend's twist dipped in peanut butter dip, and I think I prefer that one. Although in the future I'd probably just get the twist cone without any dip, in order to savour the soft serv taste.

Besides ice cream, we also got food! My friends got the twin burger and they weren't the biggest fans. Burger was too tough. They enjoyed the fries but I don't think I'd get the fries next time. I'm more of the costco/ikea fries type (super crispy and thick cut). The fries at Toms were more chewy and dense. I ordered the fish burger and it was served on a large kaiser. It was ok. Definitely very filling. 

Come for the soft serv!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream / dessert you can get in all of west end Toronto. The amount of flavours are endless and very good. Must try for any ice cream lover!"}
{"text":"Overall: Decent ice cream but not worth the hype. An old-school ice cream shop that I would pop by if I was in the immediate area but definitely not something that I would make a specific trip for. 

Taste: I went with 2 other friends and we ordered a rainbow flavour burst soft serve, a twist soft serve dipped in peanut butter, and a vanilla soft serve dipped in blue raspberry. Overall, the soft serve was decent but nothing to rave about. The individual flavours in the flavour burst didn't stand out and I felt like I was just eating regular vanilla soft serve by the end of it. The blue raspberry dip was interesting at first, but flavour gets old fast. My friend liked his peanut butter dipped cone though. 

Service: Line-up was long but moves quick. I always have difficulty choosing items when there's lots of options available and the cashier was able to point me to their recommendations. :)

Tips: 
- Lots of picnic tables nearby for you to enjoy your treat 
- Offers their own parking spots behind the shop however, it's almost always full. We parked across the street and walked over"}
{"text":"Amazing selections of desserts and ice cream, featured on BlogTo, several times as well as other food bloggers for a reason."}
{"text":"Since moving into the neighborhood going to Tom's Dairy Freeze was a must-do on our list. We went on a hot summer Wednesday night around 6 pm and there was no line! Waited for a minute and was served right away. Everyone always raved about their vanilla soft serve so I had to try it. I opted for a chocolate dip softserve cone and the hubby opted for a brownie sundae.. big mistake on his part because it was HUGE and filled with lots of brownies, chocolate sauce and a large serving of softserve!

My soft serve was really good. Had a good consistency of creaminess and the chocolate was dipped perfectly. I actually think I prefer this one over the DQ chocolate dip soft serve. Prices are average. A small cone is definitely more than enough for an icecream lover! Next time when we go back I think I would try their famous sprinkle dipped cone... Be sure to go at an odd time though (before dinner) because we have driven by before and seen the line up down the street when it's after dinner time!"}
{"text":"went there with a friend the first time. their soft ice creams are delicious. Next time i will try the hard ice creams.

They are open really late so it makes it possible for me to go there after work as i work late. Their lines move really fast. Prices are fair. A very good hangout place and also close to the beach. So if u want to have some ice cream late at night while hanging out on the beach, u can stop by here to pick up ur sweets. :)"}
{"text":"This looks like the scariest, oldest ice cream place ever but yet the line ups are nonstop with this place. 

Decided to join the masses to find out what the hype was all about - can't argue. This place is amazing. The sundae size is unreal and real fruit - I'm really embracing my proximity to this summer Etobicoke hot spot!"}
{"text":"Your going to have to worry wait long in the evenings when the city turns into a furnace. But then you'll get your cone or shake and its worth it! 

Go early, and no lineups.

The burgers and really good fries all year round."}
{"text":"This place is a typical drive-in style place.  The fare for burgers and hotdog is standard but the soft serve well it is an experience.  

My trip there was on a hot sticky day.  I needed an ice cream to cool off.  My choice was a chocolate cone dipped in peanut butter with chopped peanuts.  My wife chose the English Toffee sundae.  Both were great with ample amounts of ice cream. 

Well worth the trip down the Queensway."}
{"text":"We stopped in this afternoon while we were sitting in rush hour traffic. Had a chocolate dipped medium soft ice cream cone and it was absolutely wonderful........ took me back to my childhood and my friend had a wonderful milkshake what a great little place .......certainly need to  to come here more often in the summer.....they close down for the season on November 24th."}
{"text":"Nostalgic place for ice cream. Had the vanilla soft serve with toffee and marshmallow sauce. Cash only but there is an ATM on site (charges $1.50)."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream. Unfortunately they close during winter season! Definitely will go again once they open. My wife is crazy about ice cream, and every time we're in the area, we stop at toms for ice cream."}
{"text":"Parking is a bit scarce! You can park across the street and cross at the lights as well as beside the store. 

We came on a cloudy day, so the line up wasn't bad. Usually, it's real long. 

They have lots of seating and it'll give you a very traditional family feel, and make you feel young again. 

There were only two people working the ice cream machines, so it was a bit slow. They have a huge selection - go through the menu slowly when you're in line! I've seen lots of different combinations while waiting. 

Twisted soft serve was EXACTLY what I was feeling. 

Also, it looks like it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Love old-school ice cream posts, and Tom's doesn't disappoint.

They've got huge lines but the one thing all my favourite places have in common is that they move it quickly!  When we finally got to the window, it took just long enough to pay and put away our change before we got our ice cream!

One of us had the actual ice cream, and the rest got soft-serve products, and we were all pleased.  It might be a tiny bit more than what you get out of a truck, but the quality and quantity difference more than makes up for it (I saw some folks getting giant cones, and those don't hold up if you have insufficiently dense and cold soft-serve, which can be a common problem among the many roaming ice cream trucks in the city).

They've got ample seating, and, considering how small it is, a surprising amount of parking (though on hot summer evenings, i'll bet the overflow probably bothers the restaurant across the street).

The guy at the counter was really friendly and full of suggestions, which is always refreshing, since by the end of the day, I'm sure these folks get exhausted having to deal with indecision (or at least I imagine I would)."}
{"text":"Soft Served Ice Cream melted away unexpectedly rapid.
I think I've had better but somewhere west of Tom's.  2.5'd
My Friend likes the 50's vibe which I've yet to figure out.
Maybe it's the architectural design of the building?  
Kinda FUNKY cool I suppose."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype was about, However i enjoyed the variety of flavours. When I first got there, there was a line up already. I waited for 15 minutes at least. I tried the Cookie Monster which was vanilla soft served dipped in blue raspberry and Oreo cookie crumbles. The soft serve was good, but I could find something similar elsewhere. I live in Markham so it was a far drive and I was expecting more. There's a lot more joints downtown Toronto like fugo or la dippery which is better. I also tried the banana split - the pineapple was canned not fresh."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is still around! In my lifetime I cannot count how many chocolate/ vanilla twists I have eaten. Last time I was here I got a soft serve chocolate with marshmallows- delicious but probably would have been better with a chocolate flavour burst. Their website is great if you want to check out the whole menu before ordering. I've had friends say their burgers and fries are pretty good but obviously ice cream is the main attraction.

If the line is long... wait patiently... its worth it!"}
{"text":"I love going here for a sundae. They have so many options of ice creams, milkshakes and even food. It's all good !"}
{"text":"Scouting out locations for the Airshow and the Snowbirds wecstumbled up this place

Old school burger shake ice cream spot with picnic tables for all

I was talking to the staff and he said their soft serve ice cream has real cream and that is why people come

Too much info

Burger, fries and a shake. It is all good.

Love it, hug it, eat eat!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream place - from soft serve to hard ice cream, sherbet to slushies - there's even a grill for bigger meals in addition to the main ice cream features.  LOVED the soft serve ice cream chocolate-vanilla twist. Expected it to be like other twist cones but it's creamy like I've never had before. The sherbets - orange and lime have a sour tang to it but they're refreshing. My younger bro got a medium cone chocolate chip cookie dough and it's pretty good! Hint - medium cone means double scoop - get a bowl and spoon on the side in case of accidental spillage! Great family place - I hope to come here more often when I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little gem and I couldnt be happier!! Ice cream was mega delicious and the toppings were fresh. The staff was cute and helpful....definitely worth the line....ENJOY(I chose a vanilla cone dipped in chocolate - half sprinkles- half skor bits)"}
{"text":"The banana split. Classic. Oh my God. I never eat ice cream, like never, ever, ever. I bought this with full intention of having no more than half a bite and sharing it. I ate 3/4. I could eat 12 more. How is this ice cream just so delicious??? The reviews don't lie!!"}
{"text":"Old school creamy ice cream.

I used to think I don't like soft serve but that's because I only had low quality fast food ones. Tom's is made wth real cream and even just vanilla was so rich and creamy.

I had the 'rainbow cone,' which is one of their secret menu items. You can combine different flavor bursts. I was surprised that the lines of color added so much flavor to the creamy vanilla. Decent price and cute atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I love soft serve chocolate ice cream and for whatever reason, I find it difficult to find anywhere other than Tom's (here in Toronto at least).

Having said that, I usually order a small chocolate soft serve dipped cone enrobed in peanut butter. OMG, amazeballs!!

Prices are very reasonable as well. Pretty sure they are cash only but there is an ATM close by.

Don't be afraid of the lineup around the block (not joking) it moves quickly!!"}
{"text":"Cash only.
I've been to the other Dairy Freeze which was in a small town that I cannot remember the name of, and it was in my memories ever since (the ice cream, not the town, obviously).
Last time I had a chocolate milkshake. This time I had an insanely delicious salted caramel cookie ice cream in a cup.
SO GOOD. GO HERE! DO IT.
Long line but it went fast. No bathroom. Picnic tables out front and a small parking lot."}
{"text":"It's ok if you are going for soft serve.
Waited in a super huge line only to find out they won't make milkshakes with real ice cream.  Apparently they will only make them with soft serve (gross) even though they have hard ice cream.  My BF got one anyway and was not impressed."}
{"text":"After Mamma Martino*s if you still got room in your tummy for dessert just across the street along Queensway is Tom's Dairy.
The place looks like it hasn't changed since the 1950's with its external layout, but it still brings a crowed that stretches along Queensway. The lineup is worth the wait.
They serve your classic sundaes, dip cones and banana splits to your classic shakes, burgers and fries.
I'm addition the quality and quantity is worth every dime of dairy goodness. Whether you're waiting or enjoying your blissful dessert, they've got some patio seating catered to their patrons..... it's definitely a treat if you're ever in south Etobicoke.... I give this place a 5/5....... I live in the Markham area and wouldn't think twice about coming all the way to South Etobicoke (my soon to be new neighborhood) ;) 
Keep it up Tommy Boy!"}
{"text":"A classic spot for soft ice cream when you don't want to go to Dairy Queen. Tom's Dairy Freeze has been here forever and there's a reason for that. A definite must stop."}
{"text":"The best soft serve in the GTA in a retro classic diner that has remained unchanged for decades in the heart of Etobicoke.    Their soft serve is made of cream, not ice milk , so definitely thicker then most places.   Bring your lactid if you are lactose intolerant, I do.  :-D

The lineups on a nice day is usually very long, sometimes it wraps around the block.  Once we were there for about an hour in a lineup.....but that was okay because we were chatting with friends.   Most of the time we drive by and if the lineup is just to the sidewalk we stay, and if the lineup wraps around the sidewalk we keep driving.  

When the weather is cold or raining....that doesn't deter us, it just means there are NO LINEUPS!  :-)   I'm happy to eat an ice-cream cone in the car....and I usually save a bit for the pup too!   

What do you get at Tom's Dairy Freeze?    You ONLY get the soft serve items.   Don't get the hard ice-cream items, don't get their not very good burgers and their fries that is fried in stale oil, go to a different place to get real food.    Just go to Tom's Dairy Freeze for the soft serve.

For soft serve ...you can choose from chocolate, vanilla or twist.   You can get a berry blast , or dip it in blue raspberry, chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch....you can roll it in oreos, pecans, peanuts, chocolate chips,toffee bits...anything you want really.     You can choose between kiddie cone, small, regular, or large.   Large is very large and a good amount of ice-cream......I'm a regular cone myself...which is still a large ice-cream.  :-)  

They close around November and open again when it starts to get warm....so while they are open right now.....head on over and get the best cones!  

*btw....i had my entire wedding party friends go to Tom's after the wedding dinner for ice-cream ...it was a lot of fun*

TIP:  BRING CASH!  They don't accept any other form of payment.  There is an ATM on the side of their buildings though, but you will pay transaction fees."}
{"text":"Tom's Dairy Freeze is definitely a fun date in warm summer days. I get the love for this place. It's a clean, fun walk-up window with picnic tables and we just don't have enough of these places in Toronto. Venture into Michigan and places like Tom's Dairy are everywhere really. So I'm glad someone is keeping the nostalgia alive in the North. 

I tried the soft served ice cream and french fries, and I definitely enjoyed the ice cream, though it wasn't the best I've had. The line up situation for hot food is confusing and they don't say much at the window. I would come here again, though, for the experience, if anything."}
{"text":"If you see a big line, skip it!
Otherwise it's a good bet.  Should be mentioned; DAIRY CREAM (Cawthra/Lake Shore) is significantly better."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant from America's Dairyland, I tell you what, I know something about ice cream, frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and frozen dairy treats of all varieties. It is my biggest weakness. I've been missing proper frozen custard in Toronto and have previously been limited to good-but-not-great Dairy Queen soft serve. Then I tried Tom's last night. It is the best soft serve ice cream I've ever tried, and is as good as (though different than) frozen custard. It kind of tastes like Ovaltine to me. Love it. The line can be long, they only take cash (and it's honestly pretty expensive), and I'm glad the trashy artificial, sugary, food-colored crap options are easily avoided. Overall none of that kills the five stars. Awesome soft serve."}
{"text":"Have passed by this place for many many years but never tried it until recently. The ice cream is very creamy and smooth. I love the Rainbow burst and flavors. The ice cream is top notch. A must try."}
{"text":"Love that when i come here, im not buying my family chemically processed ice cream. A simple dipped cone is satisfying and delicious. Im anxious to try their sundaes in the future"}
{"text":"This place is super popular and I can see why. Huge lineup when we arrived but people were being served quickly so it didn't take long to get to the counter. My friend had a hot fudge sundae and after agonizing over my selection, I chose the hot caramel sundae. This place has so many options, I'll have to go back quite a few times! Lots of tables in front, so at least they can accommodate a lot of people. Parking is not the best, but at least there's a few spots. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Soft Serve Cones. There usually is a line so be prepared to wait for about 10 minutes on a busy day. The actual ice cream itself is really good. I love the chocolate dip, so I usually get vanilla ice cream double dipped (chocolate) with peanuts. 

It's delicious! Great quality and I love the vibes. The sundaes are pretty good too but I can't not get the chocolate dip. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Yummy! Waited in line for about 20 minutes. Worth it. I got a medium blue raspberry dipped cone for $4.90.

The ice cream is soft and very creamy. They advertise that they only use real cream and I can taste it. The blue raspberry isn't bad. I don't know how to describe the flavour but it was good. 

I would definitely come back and try the other flavours. My first choice was the butterscotch but they didn't have it. 

Definitely a good place to visit!!!!  My fave soft serve is from mcdonalds and this place just beat it. You can't beat mcdonalds prices, but quality of ice cream is definitely more real and way better!"}
{"text":"Unique neighbourhood spots are my favourite to go to because there's always so much history and interaction with customers on a personal level. We dropped by on our way to the Humber Bay Park, and the place was actually bigger than I imagined. Lots of seating to accommodate those busy summer nights. Not a long line during my visit, I'm assuming because they just opened for their summer season. 

We got the vanilla soft serve with strawberry burst and the twist with oreo crumbs. Tom's does not use icemilk for their soft serve like most ice cream trucks, so the ice cream is crazy smooth and creamy. Honestly, you don't even need any toppings and the ice cream is already as amazing as ice cream can get. There's also hot food served here, in case desserts not enough. 

This is not only a great spot for families and kids to hang out, but great for dates and small little gatherings. I would totally love to come back again during the warm summery nights. The whole place just harbours so much happiness. I loved it.

{"text":"Yum yum yum!
Who doesn't love eating ice cream while relaxing on picnic tables. 
The prices are incredible: $3 will get you ar small milkshake."}
{"text":"Our family's #1 choice for dipped ice cream!  We drive 20 mins just for this treat, and we've been here a number of times this summer/fall."}
{"text":"Huge selection of ice creams and treats! Milkshakes, floats, sundaes, soft serve, hard serve, banana splits, it's all here and very reasonably priced to. Big grill selection to including pouting, fries, onion rings, wings, souvlaki, chicken strips, burgers, hot dogs and more."}
{"text":"A classic!! If I ate soft serve, I'd definitely go here more often ... But I'm more then willing to stick with their delicious chocolate milk shakes that I just can't seem to find as good anywhere else. The small size is the only one I can enjoy though as it's super filling and sweet. Excellent for hot summer days in Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"Obviously the best icecream in Etobicoke. There's always a line-up but so worth the wait. The food is excellent too."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest sweets or ice cream fan but, in the summers, I have to go to Tom's Dairy Freeze! They have a huge assortment of flavours but I especially love the coconut ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is a great late night spot for ice cream if you are in the area! 

Pros:
- Options: I love places with tons of options and variety. The options and desserts range from ice cream, sundaes, shakes, banana splits and more. They also serve burgers and other foods.
- Parking: There is enough parking for cars, but I would expect that during high season, it would fill up quickly. 
- Seating: There is so many seats on the benches and tables if you were to go with a large group, you would have tons of places to sit. 
- Picture worthy: The ice cream is very picture worthy with the huge sign at the front! 
- Food: The soft serve was very creamy (as one should expect) but I did not find it amazing. It is great and creamy though! 

Cons: 
- Distance: This place is out of town and a little far, but if your are an ice cream lover it is worth the drive to try it out! 

Foods I like: 
- Strawberry Swirl Ice Cream 

Overall, the ice cream was good but not amazing. I do love the vibe though and will be back in the spring/summer time to try out more flavours!"}
{"text":"What bad can you say about Tom's. It's soft serve ice cream, it's got a nostalgic look, it's cheap and most importantly it is delicious. I love the peanut dipped option or their version of the DQ Blizzard. 

Lines can be long on a hot day but don't worry, it moves quick! Perfect stop after dinner at Mama Martino's or a cute place to take a date."}
{"text":"Peanut butter dipped soft serve was to die for! They have the options of chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch or blue raspberry dipped soft serve which is hard to come by. Only outdoor seating and service is pretty fast considering how busy it can be in the summer. Only thing we were confused about was the pricing and what they charged us as they charged us $2 extra different from the menu."}
{"text":"We were on a search for ice cream after a drive along Lakeshore drive. We'd passed several, and we were almost at the end of the road. \"Pull over here!\" I said to Lee.

There was a line. A long line. But you know? It was because there was indeed delicious ice cream. They have both hard and soft ice cream, and it's great. They do a good job of keeping the line moving.

I got a hot fudge sundae, Lee got a banana split. They were both excellent, and delicious, and just writing this now makes me want to drive up there to get some ice cream.

Don't fear the line, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went there late at night with a group of friends. If there's a line-up in the middle of the night then you know the place is good.

I tried the lemon sorbet, for non-dairy people this is probably the only thing you could order."}
{"text":"Great local ice cream joint.  The line up in the Summer may look Long, but ice cream is fantastic and the line moves fairly quick.

Expect to time travel back-to-the-future after you made your order through the window of a food-shack straight outta the Seventies... but, how else do they keep the prices low. :-)"}
{"text":"Purely amazing dipped soft serve at great prices and portions!  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5* or more!

The Queensway version of the Lakeshore's Dairy Cream.  Note:  Dairy CREAM, not Dairy Queen.  I believe both businesses are seasonal, so closed during the colder months which is completely understandable.

Anyway, during the last blast of Summer, on a humid evening, I decided to check this place out and it was quite busy!  Most of the picnic tables out front were occupied with people taking in a hot evening with a soft serve.  There was a bit of a line, but it did move quickly.

Aside from the usual, soft serve, \"hard ice cream\", and sundaes, they also have food on their menu.  Not sure if anyone actually orders it, but it's there in case you feel like a burger, fries, hotdog, et al.

I haven't been to Dairy Cream in a while, but I *think* Tom's is slightly cheaper.  A small, soft serve cone with chocolate dip was $2.65, so not a bad price for a Summer treat!

Parking:  There are spots past the picnic tables.  Do not park at the sketchy lookin' Queensway Motel for safety's sake."}
{"text":"I love trying the \"Cookie Monster\" from different ice cream places to see what unique ways they've turned their ice cream into. But sadly to say, I was disappointed. A twist (chocolate/vanilla) soft serve cone dipped in blue raspberry with Oreo cookies. Looked cute but didn't taste much better than something I can get from an ice cream truck. 

Not worth the 30 min wait. 

On the other hand, the orange float was actually pretty good"}
{"text":"Went here with the fam after dinner to grab a quick bite for dessert. After perusing the menu a bit, I tasted a couple of the ice creams and was extremely underwhelmed...no--appalled.

I ended up getting a dipped soft serve cone, which was about on par with what you would expect to get from McDonalds. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, but I wouldn't recommend it based on my experience."}
{"text":"Great little ice cream shop full of signs of the past and longevity of business. They offer both soft serve and hard ice cream as well as shakes and sundaes. If you're not in the mood for ice treats they do serve burgers and hot dogs. They have place for seating outside so you can enjoy those beautiful summer nights. 

They take cash only but there is a ATM around the corner which reminds me of an arcade machine"}
{"text":"It's warm and sunny today and I was craving an ice cream so I went to Tom's Dairy Freeze.

I drive by it fairly often but hadn't been since 2012.

I ordered a large banana split with chocolate sauce (no strawberry or pineapple sauces).  I know I should have gotten the smaller one but I couldn't resist since I hadn't had lunch.  It was big and delicious and, though I tried, I couldn't finish it all.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype over this place. The ice cream was good, but not worth lining up for 15 minutes for. With that being said when you get ice cream from this place you really feel the good vibes from this vintage looking stall. It's something fun to do on a warm summer night."}
{"text":"Such a quaint lil' spot to enjoy a soft serve on a summer afternoon. Incredibly friendly service with a super loyal following. I've been going here since I can remember and it was a constant highlight of my childhood summers. The last couple times I've gotten a small vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate and cover in chunks of Oreo! It's definitely a favourite. The picnic tables are fantastic although on a hot summer night you can bet there will be limited seating available. In addition I've ordered fries and a mint chocolate milkshake copious times when I've been hungover and it's always hit the spot. The fries are super fresh and crisp! Amazing spot that lives up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Been waiting to visit this ice cream parlour for so long. Finally came around and grabbed a cone. 

This ice cream parlour is located pretty close to Humber Bay, a great place to grab a cone after a hot day. When I came there was a pretty long line but the line goes by quickly. 

They offer a variety of desserts such as sundaes, soft served ice cream, hard ice cream, floats and etc. They also have savoury food like burgers, hot dogs and etc. 

I tried their rainbow burst ice cream because I wanted to try every flavour. The ice cream was rich and creamy. The different flavour of each colour was delicious. You can taste the transition from one colour flavour to another.  Definitely recommended. It's delicious, I finished a large cone myself. 

They have have a parking lot on the side. They also have seating inside and outside of the store."}
{"text":"Awesome place for trying soft serves for a less price. I had the resses dipped in Caramel and my friend had a blueberry dip with Oreos ... the Oreos definitely tasted better. We also had hot dog they were ok. But this place is really good for ice creams. They are thick and rich and perfect for people with a sweet tooth. The dessert can be heavy so I would say do not eat much before u come here"}
{"text":"Hands down the best soft serve ice cream in Toronto. It's so creamy and smooth, and the dips are absolutely outstanding, peanut butter is amazing if your a fan"}
{"text":"Revisited on a summer day and expected there would be a line! Honestly, i dont mind lining up when its not sweating hot and sunny. It gives u an opportunity to make conversation while lining up, it can still be fun. Plus good things take time lol

What we ordered:
Cookie monster
Orange float
Rainbow flavour burst 

I had the cookie monster, and tbh, it was a little disappointing. Last time i had the flavour burst and it totally featured the rich creamy soft serve with a hint of different flavours. Cookie monster was a blueberry dipped cone covered in oreo cookies, and sadly, all that covered up the flavours of the soft serve. I wasnt too impressed. Another miss for trying new things lol my original plan was to try their frozen yogurt, but he said it wont be available until another two weeks. Bummer! 

The wait was around 30-40mins at 8ish pm on a weekday. As we were licking our ice creams on the benches, so many people in line was asking if its worth the line up. I can yet tell until i try more thing on the menu! But I definitely recommend the flavour burst!"}
{"text":"I have been on a search for good soft serve for a couple months when I found out about Tom's Dairy Freeze. I was skeptical because I thought \"just how good can soft serve get?\". I was wrong.

The very BIG \"medium\" cone dipped in chocolate that I got almost brought tears to my eyes. Not simply because it was creamy, delicious, melty and amazing but because it reminded me of my childhood. When I was a kid (I grew up in Russia), we went to Moscow and got a chocolate covered ice cream bar. It was almost identical taste to the soft serve cone dipped in chocolate that I got at Tom's. 

Beware: the ice cream (perhaps because it's real cream and not modified milk ingredient slush) melts REALLY fast. The chocolate was almost falling off my cone. It was so worth it though. I got twist flavour but next time I am going for vanilla alone for the purity of it.

Also, their sizes are generous. A medium really is a large. I've seen people with a large and it is HUGE. I recommend starting off with a small unless you're really sure you want a LOT of soft serve.

I would highly recommend Tom's to anyone who's looking for either good soft serve or good old fashioned ice cream in general."}
{"text":"Delicious old fashioned soft serve, with the option of adding 8 different flavours to your swirl. Fun option and strangely delicious. Certainly makes for an interesting photo op, as all the young adults were posting their cones to social media. 

I never carry cash with me, so the cash only is a bit of an inconvenience. There is an ATM there, but I hate using those sketchy ones."}
{"text":"Love to drop into Tom's for an easy dessert on summer evenings.  I usually get the soft serve cone with chocolate/vanilla ice cream and dipped in butterscotch with peanuts.  

Prices are fair (soft serve cones start around $2).  There's a small parking lot for 5-10 cars and there's free parking in the area.  Seating consists of a few picnic tables and benches.  Worth stopping in for a cold treat if you're in the area.

Tom's also has a menu of fast food (burgers, fries, hot dogs, etc) but we usually go for the cold stuff."}
{"text":"We went in here yesterday and ordered two cones, one small dipped soft serve sugar cone, the other a small (single scoop) hard ice cream sugar come, that came to $8.50 which we thought was a bit much. The soft serve was nice and creamy, but not cold enough, it dripped far too fast.  The hard ice cream cone had cookie dough, but they don't give you much for a single scoop, though it did taste pretty good.  Lots of picnic tables out front to sit on and eat your cone.  

It's nice how this place looks the old-school type, but the prices are far from it."}
{"text":"The first day that Tom's opens for the season is a momentous one in my household. The delicious real soft-serve (no edible oil products here!), the retro drive-up location, the milkshakes, and my favourite - the small twist chocolate fudge sundae with peanuts. What a treat! 

The portion sizes are huge -  a large cone is considered a dare, and is easily 10 inches of towering soft-serve.  The line-ups are long in the heat of the summer, but move quickly. 

Oh Tom,  thank-you."}
{"text":"Classic, and cheap soft serve ice cream! Can't go wrong here on a sunny day. They have so many options, but the soft serve is the way to go. Grab a vanilla or chocolate swirl and add a topping on it!"}
{"text":"Soft Served Ice Cream............ OH YAY!!!!

So creamy.. So airy...So  soft....  Tom's Dairy Freeze you really impressed me!!  Now when I think of Soft Served, Tom, you are my man! :)

Since soft served ice cream has to be eaten on the spot.. it  made the experience not able to be duplicated at home... and making it always a joy to enjoy it the moment before it melt away... which can be nasty! (Yelp Friend Hey you! Stop licking your fingers and made a mess!)

I really like Tom's Dairy Freeze's that has this 50's vibe... not only in the deco..but here there is nothing about all natural, organic, low fat., sugar free...just plain old sinful delight for one to enjoy!

And BTW, Soft serve is also much lower in fat than conventional ice cream, because of the increased air content, and it has a lighter flavor! And the lower milk-fat content (3 to 6%) compared to ice cream (10 to 16%)..

Can I use this as an excuse for me to indulge and get an Large next time??  Yes Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"The best, creamiest soft serve ice cream I've ever had. Ever. It's so creamy, my friends and I have termed it the \"Tom effect\", nothing else ever tastes as good after having a Tom's soft serve ice cream. My personal favourite - chocolate & vanilla twist dipped in chocolate. The chocolate isn't the cheap artificial stuff - it's real chocolate!"}
{"text":"On a nice day the line is usually super long but it's worth the wait. I love soft serve vanilla ice cream dipped in a hard chocolate"}
{"text":"Okay this place is definitely growing on me.  I started on the first visit with the soft serve which was probably a mistake because their 'hard' ice cream is definitely the way to go.  Although the flavours ate not made on site, they are sourcing from somewhere special and the flavours and fun and whimsical. birthday Cake, Pistachio, tigers tail, all fun choices, buy my current fave is banana!  You can even call ahead to check for flavour and line up status.  I've seen 30 deep lines here even when it's raining out so come wih a calm head and not in a rush.  The line moves very fast and the servers are friendly.  They even have burgers and fries carnival like foods for those looking for the more savoury option.  Fun local joint."}
{"text":"Update:  I took home 2 one litter soft serve containers with flavors spun in.  Too bad...at $7 each.....they had ZERO flavor.....a waste of  $14 plus tax.  I'm really disappointed.   I did give 4 stars but because of this, I'm taking 3 away.

Huge disappointment and I guess they're so popular, they don't care anymore, because no one has made ANY effort to contact me to make it right. 

VERY disappointing indeed. 

The food and the ice cream at the restaurant were great.

Had a steak sandwich with onion rings and a yummy banana split.

Big line but moves fast."}
{"text":"I have been to better ice cream places similar to this and I'm not sure what all the hype is about..
I ordered the butterscotch dipped cone with vanilla icecream and the icecream wasn't sweet and the butter scotch had absolutely no flavour.
I had waited 30 minutes in line to get an icecream I could have got at Dairy Queen which would have tasted better!

If there so busy why we're only 2 people working on a Friday night ?!?

Seriously I would have rather been doing something better with my time .. oh and! 
It's impossible to get parking."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm not from the area, but I thought Tom's was good, just not great. I got a cheeseburger & strawberry milkshake. I liked how the bun was fluffy & crispy, but I didn't care for the actual burger. It wasn't anything special. I enjoyed the strawberry milkshake but would probably get it 'extra thick' next time as it was a bit too liquid-y for my liking."}
{"text":"Love it!  Can't get enough of their ice cream.  I usually get my regular chocolate ice cream dipped in chocolate.  Last few times I changed it up and added smarties to it. Hubby had ice cream dipped in peanut butter and had skor bits added in top. Then we brought some friends who also customized their cones. The quality is great. There's no indoor seating but plenty of room to sit outside and enjoy your ice cream.  I recommend them to everyone looking for a quick dessert."}
{"text":"On a crisp summer's eve three pals dropped all cynicism and pretension and piled into an automobile heading towards Etobicoke in search of simpler times. Tom's Dairy Freeze delivered. 

All of the treats your inner child can think of, street side picnic tables and signage from the seventies. Kids getting ice cream after sport ball* practice and parents not checking their smart phones. Outrageously cute. 

Slushies, soft serve, frogurt, burgers, shakes, floats, fries, 'tines and rings. Ev. Er. Ey. Thing. 

PEPPER TAKES PAUSE: Get lost in a root beer float and try not to feel optimistic about the future. I dare you. 

*The sport formerly known as soccer, only everyone wins. Pretty silly."}
{"text":"Cash is king! 
this place is great, sad to say that it took me almost four years to come and check this place out and man I should have done it sooner. I don't think I have driven by in the summer when a line up wasn't present, the only time ive not seen a line up is when the place is closed! surprised to say that the line up moves really quickly which is great, minus the multiple people who don't bring cash...BACK OF THE LINE! an atm is on site which is great for those who don't bring cash, but if you are reading this BRING CASH or BACK OF THE LINE! the pricing is really good here and amazing considering the flavor, the service is quick, and this is some amazing quality of ice cream and treats. 
really happy that I finally came to this place, and tried it out. next summer im coming on a weekly basis!. 
you gotta try it! 
parking is on site, but spots are taken up pretty quickly, transit options are the 76 royal York with a bit of a walk, and the more direct bus is the 80 Queensway."}
{"text":"Food ***
Service ***
Ambiance ****

It's an ice cream shop.  I opted for the soft serve and it was what I expected... generic soft serve.

It's a cool spot in the summer and clearly had a lot of tradition...

I may update the rating/post when I try their hard ice cream."}
