{"text":"I was there for high tea.  The tea/food was fine and your typical tea fare, but this place is outrageously overpriced. The waiter asked us if we wanted a glass of champagne, and on the menu it said $30, so my friend assumed it was $30 for a bottle, and asked for just a glass.  It turns out it was $30 for the glass!!  The tea package was $37 per person, so we got two for the three of us to share.  My friend who had the tea on the side was charged $10 for it!!  It's just way too expensive for what they offer - it's not *that* fancy.  $10 for tea is just absurd.  I also felt the waiter offering the champagne without mentioning the outrageous price was a bit deceitful, especially since when you see a number on the menu you often assume it's the price for the bottle, not the glass.  Will not go here again."}
{"text":"Sunday past mom & I brunched here. We were not disappointed. The food was lovely as was the update of this resto's image. I love the open kitchen concept, especially the crepe counter. While the food was great, the utensils were dated and placed in the wrong places. There were ice tongs used at the sushi bar? Since the QE blew out with the 143 million re-branding they should spend a few dollars to get proper serving tongs. The servers had wonderful attitudes but very evidently the majority had very little experience. I was nearly backed into 3 times. Its was a good experience overall but there is much room for improvement."}
{"text":"Although I really enjoyed my experience at the Nacarat located in the same hotel, I must admit that my experience at the Rosélys was rather disappointing.   We had a reservation at noon and were seated very quickly, the waiter presented us with the table d'hôte menu which immediately caught our attention as it lacked variety. As starters, we had the choice between a salmon gravlax and a salad with seafood, for one of my colleagues who can't eat seafood, let's say that it was quite restrictive. Then, on all the proposed main courses, only one was not fish-based: the beef tenderloin.  I ordered the salmon gravlax and the lobster and scallop gnocchi. Given that the day before had been festive for me, I abstained from ordering wine but the proposed selection which came with the table d'hôte seemed to be very good according to the others. Our starters arrived fairly quickly, then. it. was. long... very very long ...   We arrived at noon and still had not received our plates at 1:30... and we weren't the only ones, as most of the room was without their order and many did not seem very happy. We ended up receiving our long-awaited main courses that we had to swallow at full speed while paying our bills and having to run back to the office in record time ...   The food was very good but we were unanimous on the fact that we won't come back, at least not during lunch hour because there's clearly a lack of coordination."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner at Rosélys to give the post-renovation Queen Elizabeth a try. The restaurant is just beautiful, modern and sofisticated, but keeping an open kitchen as a cool touch. We had the octopus and the snails starters and then went for the \"to share\" duck. Starters were good, particularly the snails, which had a great mix of flavours and a touch of orange that really made it special. But the duck really surprised us. Starting with the size of the portion, much more generous than expected. And delicious!!! I don't know how I found some room for dessert, but I'm glad I did. Usually I'm not a chocolate chocolate chocolate person but at this place they give it a touch of lemon that makes it absolutely perfect! Overall, it was an excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"Superbe lieu au décor retro, bien situé au centre ville. J'y suis allée un soir de semaine après un événement professionnel. L'accueil était impeccable et très soigné . Nous étions 3 et avons eu l'opportunité d'être assises a un booth avec une table ronde. Parfait pour des discussions. Le bar aurait été un bel endroit également et j'y retournerai avec plaisir juste pour pouvoir essayer ce bar et les cocktails. Nous avions deja mangé un peu et par conséquent avons choisi sur le menu des entrées. J'ai dégusté des huîtres fines de clair, parfaitement présentées, et un gravlax de poisson qui lui aussi était divin. Mes copines ont goûté une soupe de courge qui a fait l'objet d'un petit cérémonial de versement dans les bols et une tartine qui semblait délicieuse.  J'y reviendrai sans hésiter, entre copines, collègues, couple, car il est possible de bien discuter et se faire entendre sans crier tout en dégustant une cuisine très goûteuse."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a tasty lunch at Rosélys.  The grilled romaine salad was delicious - just the right mix of flavors - and the duck was definitely worth trying!  Next time I am definitely trying the squash soup!  The service was as good as the food and my water glass and wine glass were never empty."}
{"text":"Limited menu selection. Friendly staff. Went for coffee and decent service. Loud music that kind of takes away from the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were too lethargic to go out, and though we don't usually hit up the hotel restaurants, we figured that we'd give Roselys a shot. I'm glad that we did. The space is big and roomy, with a nice open kitchen, huge bar, and comfortable seating. Our server was casual but friendly. We started with a sampler of oysters and wine: oysters were very good, and my only observation regarding the wine is that they should have more varied selections by glass . (I know: they want to sell bottles. It was a casual dinner for two, not freakin' Mardi Gras.) We then got their steak with some frites, which was very good, though the portion was a bit smaller than I would have liked for the price.   Overall, a very good hotel restaurant. I don't know if Roselys is a \"destination\" resto, but it does what it does very well."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat at the hotel Resto however I decided to try today based on how impressed I had been with the renovations the hotel has undergone and the atmosphere was quite inviting. Nice decor, friendly professional wait staff and a new ope kitchen concept. I had the kale salad and the daily chef's creation.  He salad was very good, the dressing had great flavour without overtaking the kale. My main course was a risotto. I love risotto and when the dish arrived, it looked very appetizing. Sadly the whole-wheat risotto lacked flavour. I think the whole-wheat took nature of the grain tool away any chance of rich flavour I was expecting. This was a disappointment for me as I was really looking forward to it.  Great ambience, awesome service, I would try something else next time."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences of my life!!  I'm here for work and 4 of us, all women, ordered dinner with just one ordering a filet medium well. It came to her extra well done so we urged her to send it back. She did and 20 MINUTES LATER she received a extra rare steak, so rare she couldn't eat it. The manager made a poor attempt at apologizing then told her she would have to pay for one of the steaks. Outrage erupted at our table! (HELL TO THE NO!!!) Then the owner stopped and immediately castigated my friend for not accepting what she was served and went on to insult her and the rest of us about being terrible customers, not appreciating his \"sacrifice\" as a restauranteur, etc. Complete BS. He wouldn't back down but we wouldn't either until we made it clear she wasn't paying and we were going to inform all of Montreal what a terrible place this was. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Happy Valentines! I so enjoyed the atmosphere having Lunch with an ole friend in this spacious new Resto. Trendy, open space and service was fantastic! Appetizer was Cream of Broccoli soup with a dash of crumbled bacon and tiny bits of cheese curds. Wonderful to the palette. My main dish was raviolis stuffed with ricotta cheese with tiny bits of butternut squash and walnuts. Tasty! Dessert was Tiramisu with a cappuccino. Definitely would return to explore other menu specialties. Pricey but a wonderful treat."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 9 people for Sunday brunch - it was only the second brunch since opening so they told us before entering that there may be some kinks to work out.  Apart from seating everyone with reservations a few minutes late it was a very enjoyable meal.  The decor is much more open before, with a retro MadMen style chic, it's very clear and nice. There is a bit less food selection that before but the quality has gone up a few notches.  I would not hesitate to eat here for brunch again. I'm sure the service and food offerings will evolve as they gain experience but for a second brunch it's definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Le brunch style buffet une très bonne variété allant du buf tartare au crêpes au grab manier. Le seul hic que le rapport qualité prix n'est pas encore là."}
{"text":"This review is for their Afternoon Tea Service.   I came for Afternoon Tea on a weekday so there wasn't any wait nor busy. They give you a tray of small canisters with dried tea leaves for you to pick which tea you like. I ordered the Ontario Ice Wine white tea which was great on its own or with milk and sugar. The service included the usual small finger sandwiches, warm scones and desserts. I wanted to eat everything because it was all delicious. It was filling so we had some leftovers."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Fairmont recently and decided to try Roselys for breakfast on my last day. It turned out to be my only bad meal in Montreal. I think the chefs decided to prioritize creativity over taste. I ordered a waffle, which they paired with some kind of dried, sugary fruit spread and just a tiny drizzle of syrup on top. It tasted like I was eating apple pie. Maybe some people like apple pie for breakfast--but I wanted a waffle. I ended up having to scrape most of that fruit spread off and eat the waffle basically dry (since they didn't bring any syrup to the table). My server, meanwhile, was rather rude and abrupt. There were plenty of other nice, friendly servers floating around the restaurant (and, in fact, I had to rely on these others to refill my orange juice and coffee since my own waiter couldn't be bothered. I wish I could have left them the tip!) And the cost of this unappetizing breakfast was just outrageous. I could have gone down to the underground mall and gotten some food and coffee for a fraction of the price, and it would have undoubtedly tasted better than what I was given at Roselys!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch before catching a train. Service is excellent and the place is airy and kinda cozy"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and it was really great. I've been to the fairmont in Montebello for their brunch and was looking forward to enjoying something similar close to come once the queen Elizabeth opened up. Each were good but different- Montebello has the beautiful view while roselys had a few things to their choices that weren't offered at the other location like tartare and oysters, candy bar and smoothies. I would say this is the best brunch in the city!"}
{"text":"I initially wanted to eat and have drinks at Nacarat but some of the menu items I wanted were not available such as the lobster Mac and cheese and the beef tartare. So I had one drink which they also have at Rosélys called Dubonnet and left. If you wanna try a light gin drink I recommend it.  I had a glass of Robert Mondavie Pinot Noir at Rosélys and it was very good!   Rosélys is big and a nice looking restaurant. There's an open kitchen so you can see the chef and sous chefs working.   The reason I'm giving it only three stars is because the service was pretty bad. It took an hour to get our entrees and we kept having to ask for water. The waiter said it's because two tables were keeping them busy but the restaurant was not very busy.   My cousin and I shared two starters. We had the Eastern Township Rainbow Trout and the roasted octopus. Out of the two I preferred the octopus. It was good but not amazing. It had curried cauliflower and capers in it.   I had the 6oz beef flank which was tasty especially the sauce. It was so buttery. There were mushrooms and string beans as well. Normally they put almonds on it but because my cousin is allergic we asked them not to put any. The meal was good but perhaps a bit pricy for the size and for what it was. My cousin had the Arctic char. I took a bite. It didn't have much flavour to be honest. My dish was definitely better.   Besides the steak the food was just ok. I picked this restaurant to go to for my birthday but honestly I wish I had picked another."}
{"text":"I've been waiting with bated breath for them to re-open because the Fairmont was one of my regular spots. I'd had tea at le Montréalais before where the food was decent but service and decor were so-so, all off-set by the much-better-than-Toronto prices.  I had a sort of crappy day last week and decided that I needed to cheer myself up with afternoon tea. Unfortunately for me, it was too late to go to the Ritz and all the other places I was looking at were either too far away (because I had a plane to catch), closed, or required reservations a day in advance. So the Rosélys it was.  I was shocked at how much they increased the price after the renovation - afternoon tea sans alcohol was $26 at the Montréalais, pre-renovation. Now itès $37 at the Rosélys (compared to I think $35 at the Ritz and $25ish in other, less fancy but well-reputed tea rooms). But I had a bad day, so I needed to do what I had to do.  The service was great. Someone was nice enough to carry my suitcase upstairs (because the tea room is on the second floor of the restaurant) and the staff were wonderful - perfect mix of attentive but not overbearing. They wheeled out a fancy cart with lots of bottles of champagnes in it to try to entice you to go for the more expensive option, but I'm not a big drinker, so I didn't bite. They also brought out a selection of tea leaf samples in pretty bottles for you choose your tea, and I went with the classic Darjeeling, which is one of my faves.  The china is gorgeous, and the decor is very new. They brought out my pot of tea with a cute little tea timer that tells you how long to let it steep for, depending on how strong you want your tea. I found that my tea never really got as strong as I wanted though, so I'm not sure if the timer wasn't compatible with my tea or if they didn't give me enough leaves. But regardless, the tea was nice.  They provide rock sugar for your tea, which is beautiful and fun but which I find annoying in practical use because it takes forever to dissolve. My tea service came shortly after, with a nice selection of tiny savoury pieces, pastries, and two scones.  The savoury sandwiches were nice - a basic cucumber, a basic egg salad one, a nice smoked salmon option, and my favourite - some kind of creamy, savoury seafood concoction. In an ideal world, I'd have just a couple pieces each of the salmon and the seafood! Very good.  The pastries were alright. Very rich, decadent hazelnutty, crunchy chocolate cake with a layer of what tasted like panna cotta. There was a lemon tart, which was good despite it not being my cup of tea - ditto the carrot confit macaron. There was a very buttery tasting fruity poundcake, which I enjoyed, a fruit tart, and buttery cookie topped with white chocolate.   The scones are my favourite part of any tea and it was the part that kind of fell short. They were very good-looking, smooth scones and I tend to prefer more rugged, jagged scones (like the Kitten and the Bear in Toronto). I found their scones to be quite dense. Buttery, but a bit heavy for my preference. Worst of all was the jam. I think they serve jam from their gourmet shop - they come in these cute, little pots - but they must be 'healthy jam' because it lacked flavour. Wasn't very sweet or fruity (I had the raspberry)...tasted like the healthy, 'twice the fruit, less sugar' jams I get at the supermarket. So that wasn't great.  At two points, someone came out to give me surprise, complimentary food, which I appreciated. The first was a savoury pea puree cube, meant to be dipped in a yogurt that reminded me of tzatziki, and crushed pistachios. They instruct you to eat it in a bite. It was very creamy - must have been avocado in there - and savoury. Not what I'm used to, but it was interesting. The second was a sweet one - a cube of raspberry-red pepper um...solidified cream? Dipped in white chocolate, also meant to be eaten in one bite. Not my thing but it was different and interesting and of course, free food is always very much welcome and appreciated.  Overall, the servers and the ambience were wonderful, and I loved their beautiful china. But the food was just so-so. Combined with the newly elevated prices...I'm not sure it's worth it. But they are the only ones providing full afternoon tea service in a central area without having to make reservations and without a 3:30pm-latest-sitting, so they could easily do well just based on convenience."}
