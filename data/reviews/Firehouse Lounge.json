{"text":"Great place to meet up and waste a night.  Does tend to be smokey but it doesn't take away from the appeal.  Moderately noisy and overall great food and cheap drinks.  I try to get to  this bar every time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  Who doesn't love great wings?"}
{"text":"Good wings, a few extremely loud, obnoxious, functionally retarded drunks. Still not a bad place overall though."}
{"text":"The website is definitely deceiving. I thought that I was looking at a place with a  huge menu and a great atmosphere. But when I showed up it was a whole in the wall smoky bar. It seemed like a bunch of locals which isn't a bad thing but I don't like to eat with a bunch of smokers.   We got the menu and it was extremely small and limited. It was supposed to be taco night but I was told that they didn't serve enough tacos so they were out. The other review says best wings and I was craving wings from the menu but apparently they are only served on certain days. My husband and I ordered burgers which were nothing special. The buns were toasted in the small toaster in the back.   Drinks were cheap but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Look no further for the best wings in town! This place is a no-frills bar. Not much in the way of a beer selection on tap unless domestic lagers are your thing. It could certainly use some updates, but dang, the wings are good! Be prepared to sit in a cloud of smoke though."}
{"text":"On wingnight, had cheap Yuengling drafts (always a good thing)...along with Buffalo, Fiesta & Garlic Parmesan wings...perfectly fried & topped with lots of sauce.  On another night, tried 3 more flavors, Wingdust, Wingasm & Rattlesnake (Those, plus Fiesta, are shown in my posted pic). I drive 30 minutes to get here & tolerate a very smokey bar to enjoy the... Best wings ever, seriously!"}
