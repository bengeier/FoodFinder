{"text":"From the rude service to the fishy grilled squid, everything about this night out was awful. The server was rude to my family and neglected to do simple things like check in with us after the food was delivered or refill water glasses. The grilled squid app had obviously been sitting around as it smelled like no good seafood should. The lamb soulvaki was passable but the grilled chicken breast was so overcooked it was inedible. The sauce for the potatoes tasted like watery ketchup and the vegetables were near raw. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had at this restaurant! The food was delicious, cooked to perfection, and the waiters were delightful! It's been a long time since we've had such great service! The waiters were prompt, attentive and funny! We will definitely return to eat here."}
{"text":"Appetizers are Good, Drinks are done right, food is hot and taste amazing. Service can be a little slow, but its worth the wait when you get the food. Nice place. ( Get a booth ) a little more comfy. Its a nice place to take your significant other"}
{"text":"I have been to this Mr Greek location frequently but this time I decided to write a review because what my family and I experienced was simply ridiculous.  

First I ordered the grilled kalamari.  The server politely appologized for not having it.  I thought ok, let me try the octopus.  Again she appologized.  And it doesn't end there.  Believe it or not they also did not have:
-Greek beer.  Come on.  This is a Greek restaurant.
-They didn't have Heiniken 
-Apparently their blender is broken and my wife was unable to get a cocktail.

When I came last week they didn't have steak.  I didn't dare ask for steak because I was scared they still may not have it.

By now the poor girl was very embarrassed.  I am not blaming her.  It's not her fault.  But when so many products are missing why even open?  I settled for a chicken souvlaki and that tasted very dry.  I wasn't going to complain because what would be the point?

This used to be a great place to eat but the quality of food or lack of products has really turned me off from this place.

Hopefully others have not experienced what I have gone through.
Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"1 Gyros in a pita with everything to go. 
That was my order. 
The pita was stale and burned, the meat was dry and crunchy, the onions were too strong, cheap on the tsaziki and the tomatoes were warm. 
I got there just before the lunch crowd, so everything should be fresh. It wasn't. 
If I didn't take it to go, I would have sent it back. 
One star is too good."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times. Each time is a different experience. I normally go here with at least 3-4 people. We normally just order a whack ton of dips and appetizers instead of ordering individual meals. 

What we order:
Hummus is a must when I go to any Greek place to eat. They give you a basket full of pita to dip it in there. Have to say that it's not the BEST I've ever had but it definitely does the job!

Village Salad made with tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, red onions, feta, olives & EVOO. I normally order this without the olives (preference). A great dish to share with friends! It's always been a go-to of mine especially since it helps \"clear\" the palette before chowing down on anything else. 

Kalamari is not everyone's dish however it's not bad. Last few times I've had this at the table my friends went crazy over it and ate all of it and raved about the seasoning and how fresh it was. 

Keftedes - meatballs smothered in tomato sauce - I've tried this a few times and sometimes it's a hit and sometimes is a miss. I would recommend that you try the sauce and if you find it salty the whole dish is basically ruined. Last time I didn't check and popped the whole meatball in my mouth and it tasted like I drank salt water. (Told our server and they brought it back, apologized profusely, took it off the bill and gave us free desserts) 

Saganaki which is Kefalogravlera cheese flamb√©ed in front of you is always fabulous! The fact that the cheese is nice and hot and gooey makes me want some right now. Whatever you do, DO NOT eat it by itself unless you want to . Make sure you eat it with the bread that they provide you with! Also, ask for some extra lemon. Some people find that it tastes better with a little bit more lemon juice on it. (me!)

Souvlaki sticks. What can I say about this except that it's chicken and pork on a stick. Normally we order enough that each individual gets at least 2 sticks each. The seasoning on these are nice and not overpowering for the meat which is great.
 
Their Gyro appetizer comes with a small side of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta and red onions. Sometimes it's a bit dry, let your server know and they will bring out a new plate which in my experience has always been a lot better than before. 

Overall, I would go again and again. Great atmosphere since it's not crazy busy and the service there has always been wonderful. Yes, the food there isn't the BEST in the city but for some quick Greek it's not that bad! =)"}
{"text":"Authentic Greek Food? Try again! 

The only thing good about this location are the hostesses! Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Terrible food! Not authentic Greek food at all! The chicken souvlaki was dry, the rice has no flavour, and the salad was clearly a pre packed mix with the cheapest lettuces you can get! I love Greek food, and have heard good things about this chain- but j was more than disappointed when I brought my food home (takeout) and it was in this condition after I paid $15 for a meal with a drink. The staff seemed lazy, bored, and inattentive. Improvements must be made to be successful! And you should start with better staff."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Mediocre quality. Not recommended.

Update: I've been to this place with my colleagues a few more times and had a better experience. So I am bumping up the stars from 1 to 2."}
{"text":"Ok. Jeeez. The lady (if you consider her one) is such a god damn flake! She has absolutely no manners! I heard her bullying and be-littling her own employees before my very eyes! I actually couldn't believe what came put of her garbage compactor!!!
She is a disgusting pig and should be ashamed of herself for talking to her foreign workers in the back like that. Soo ungrateful! ..If it weren't for them, you'd be nothing!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly but the food is very expensive for what you get. I got the lentil soup & chicken Greek salad. The salad was very... bland. The veggies and lettuce weren't the freshest and crisp. My biggest complaint is the amount of feta they put. It was so much it overpowered everything and I threw most of it out. Heeps of feta and not enough chicken for 12.50. Like I said staff was great but food was mediocre. Not to mention it was all very greasy."}
{"text":"Lamb used to be on my list of 'dislikes', but I tried it here (covered in Tzatziki sauce) and it was instantly removed from the list.  Very tender and lots of flavour.  

Good-sized portions, although a lot of the dish is rice and/or potatoes.  I was disappointed with the Moussaka.  It was a little soggy and didn't have much taste.  I should mention that eggplant is on my 'favourite foods' list.

The Spanakopita was sub-par.  Not flaky enough and definitely didn't taste fresh.  Quite a disappointment.

I love the potatoes and Tzatziki and could easily enjoy that as a meal.  Unfortunately, that only covers a couple of food groups."}
{"text":"We sat down for lunch here recently, placed our orders and not 2 minutes later did the server bring out our food.

I'm all for getting served quickly, but this was alarming. Despite this we didn't question the server, we were hungry, so we ate.

Not surprisingly our food was cold (the time foil wrap was warmish), I can only assume with zero prep time they either make all their food ahead of time and have it sit under heaters or they made the wrong order earlier and had it sit out until a someone else ordered the same thing. I'm not sure which is worse, but either option is pretty unacceptable for such a large restaurant.

At least with their fast food locations they make the food in front of you.

Neither of us finished our meals. Neither of us will return."}
{"text":"Although the food is pretty good, this place really needs a renovation! The wall on the side of me (I was sitting in a booth) had a bunch of stains on it, the seats were all ripped, and a bunch of paint was chipped off the table and the wall. It's unappetizing to see and be in an environment like that when you're trying to enjoy you're lunch. Also, for a Thursday afternoon, it was not busy at all. There were only 2 customers in the section we were at. The food took longer to come than expected, seeing there weren't many people there. Overall, I won't go back until they renovate the place. It's very very old and outdated."}
{"text":"This restaurant has improved their quality and quantity of food the last two times I went. The service is still slow but its a good place to eat it when you are in the Kennedy commons plaza. The portions are always big with lots to take home for leftovers so that is good. Their alcoholic drinks are decent in price and a good variety."}
{"text":"It's been awhile but we thought we would give it a try.  Their sign is slowly eroding and the name is now M G eek.  Hopefully the food is not equally sad.  Ordered beef souvlaki and  lamb souvlaki dinners.  Place wasn't super busy at 8:30 on a Saturday.  Requisite Greek salad that has oily slightly limp head lettuce.  Weird garlic bread that was toasted yet garlic spread is stone cold as is the bread???  Food merely okay.  Lamb souvlaki was tough cut of meat.  They really should up the ante as it would be so easy to make it the go to Greek place if they tried..."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many other Mr. Greek restaurants, but this one is pretty good.  I love their Saganaki, and their garlic bread is to die for.  Their greek salad is quite good, but standard of most Greek restaurants.  Servers are always attentive."}
{"text":"Its good food,  the potatoes or their type of coating on them isn't to my liking but it's not bad food either"}
{"text":"After trying to place an order online for delivery the website deleted the order. (Over $50). My boyfriend was understandably frustrated so I said forget it, I can just call. 
A woman grunted when answering the phone. I thought I had the wrong number. Not even a hello. I asked if I could place an order for delivery. She grunted yes then yelled things at someone. I said we'd like the fried calamari. She said \"we're out.\" I said okay how about the grilled calamari? She snapped again, \"we're out!\" No apology. No explanation as to why a Greek restaurant would be out of it. No offer of something else. Nothing. I found her attitude terrible. I said thanks and hung up the phone. 
I live across the street and have no desire to order there or go into the restaurant. I'll be telling my neighbours of this experience as well. 
We ordered Swiss Chalet and were treated much nicer and half the price."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mr. Greek, we come here in lieu of burger chains or other fast-food sometimes. Consistent, quick and lots of choices. I always order fish and chips (yes, I know boring and not Greek at all!) and my husband orders gyro with rice which he really likes.  We often order the sauteed mushrooms mostly for the yummy garlic oil at the bottom of the dish which we dip our bread in. I have had the Village salad which is as you would expect and surprisingly fresh.  I always want to try the rotisserie chicken but am too set in my ways I guess!  Service is good and fast. 
The restaurant is a little dingy & considering how busy I've seen it at times they can afford it -  it could really use a good scrub top to bottom, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I came here with friends for lunch over the Christmas Holiday and it was empty. I think we may have been the first customers.

No one greeted us at first then a server came from the bar area and looked as if he didn't want to be there. A smile goes a long way.

I ordered the gyro and it was good that it wasn't dry or too salty. I tried my friend's pork souvlaki and it was juicy. The food was ok. I think the menu changed and the prices are more expensive than what they used to be.

I wish their service was more attentive."}
{"text":"I have always loved Mr Greek!  The downside to it BEFORE was that I felt the food came out a little slow.  BUT now it's fast!  Fast, delicious, good value, good price, friendly casual environment.  For all the times that I've been, there has never been a wait.  The restaurant is very big and they have a good amount of people working.  Overall it was excellent no complaints.  Well...I guess they could improve on the bread they bring out before your meal...otherwise it's perfect.  My favourite is the grilled calamari dinner ^_^"}
{"text":"Moussaka is my dish of choice here... Something which I dared to try a couple of years ago and it hasn't disappointed me. I would prefer that over grilled meats since those aren't really my fancy. They usually end up quite dry and chewy which doesn't make the meal enjoyable.
Overall service was good, nothing to complain about. Atmosphere kinda noisy but then again, this is a large place. Authentic Greek food? Probably not, but still makes for a good meal if you know what to order."}
{"text":"I come here with my colleague quite often. I would say once a week, and when we really want to bad talk our boss, twice a week. :)

Food is honestly not as bad as everyone rates it. The appetizers come out quickly.... Less than 5 minutes after we order. 
We usually get the chicken souvlaki dinner with the two sides for the main. Consistent flavour every time. 

They take a small fee for hot water with lemon.
But when I just order hot water, they don't. When I order ice water, I get a slice of lemon but they don't charge me. I don't understand the logic. 
The girls bathroom is always clogged."}
{"text":"Given the good ambiance and the nice decoration, besides the fact that the place is large and well lit giving a feeling of vastness, I assumed that the dishes would be small because the prices are ridiculously low for such a place. I ordered a ordered a Gyro \"appetizer\" to make sure I won't be hungry after eating my main dish of Moussaka.. it is only $13 so I thought it must be small. I hardly finished my Moussaka and the pile of rice and salad that came with it. The gyro \"appetizer\" will be tomorrow's dinner for me - it is huge and tasty and comes with salad and cheese as well.. all for only $7. Wow! Great value for money, and you without sacrificing anything else.. great ambiance, service, and also great for your health (I am not a nutritionist but I saw all elements in the dish)."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Mr. Greek so this is a general review rather than a specifically location oriented one:

The menu, like most semi-ethnic chains, consists partly of the cuisine in question and partly of Canadian/American things for the members of a party who don't like \"furrin\" food.  We chose to have the souvlaki and gyros offerings with two different orders of soup.  The lentil was decent if not spectacular but the avgolemono seemed to lack both eggs and lemon, being really just chicken rice soup.  The gyros and souvlaki (I had the pork) were decent but not special.  The souvlaki was somewhat overcooked and both were way too salty in the typical pattern of chains like this in order to get one to order more wine or cocktails.  The \"Greek\" salad that came with them used iceberg instead of romaine, had a tiny number of kalamatas and lacked both anchovies and green peppers.  Their house roasted potatoes were done in some sort of tomato sauce which provided a decent flavour but prevented them from getting nicely brown.  

We only really tried this place because one of our party was curious.

If you are the type of person who likes chains with watered down versions of ethnic food and drink menus with lots of sweet cocktails, this will be good for you.  Otherwise, eat at a real Greek restaurant.

Service was very nice, too bad it was wasted on this place."}
{"text":"I came here with my grandmother on a Sunday evening. We usually avoid Greek restaurants because they are not vegetarian-friendly. The last time I was here was probably 10 years ago, when I was dragged here for a large family gathering with my uncles, aunts and cousins. But this Mr. Greek location has stood the test of time in Scarborough and still gathers lots of families for birthday celebrations and bar flies who just want to watch sports on the TVs.

For vegetarians, there is exactly one entree, since all the rice and potatoes are cooked heavily in chicken stock. The vegetable souvlaki ($14.95) was actually quite amazing! The freshly grilled eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms and red onions were wonderfully flavourful and enhanced by a little bit of salt. The French fries were fresh and hot. My dish also came with a tomato sliced in half and decked with yummy feta.  

The only other two vegetarian options - desserts aside - are two soups; the lentil soup was a good sized portion and well-flavoured (I can't remember the other one). 

While I wouldn't really want to come back here, it's not a horrible choice if you happen to be the only vegetarian in a large party.

Don't bother if you're vegan."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this Mr. Greek on Monday with two colleagues.  I love Greek food and don't get a chance to eat it often.

I ordered rice, potatoes and chicken souvlaki.  Everything was hot and tasty.  The garlic \"bread\" was just okay.

Our server was efficient and took care of us."}
{"text":"We just had lunch today at Mr. Greek. We had the platter for two option where you can choose one appetizer & you get two sides & two mains. Great deal! Lots of food. We ate only half & took the rest home to eat for dinner. Service was prompt. No problems there. The restaurant wasn't that full & there is some construction going on outside. It's not the finest food out there but it's decent."}
{"text":"Went there on our anniversary and it was not very enjoyable. The waitress staff was very friendly with the exception of one server who just looked plain bored with his job. The location is good but hasn't changed at all in years. The food did not taste very fresh and I did not enjoy it all that much. One of the lower quality Mr. Greeks I've been to."}
{"text":"The food quality and price are thumbs up.  I love greek food, and this place give you good value for your money.  

The service here however needs work.  There is one waitress at this location that is particularly bad.  After they bring you your food here, you don't see them again.  They don't check up on you to see if you need anything else.  I sensed a bit of attitude from the workers here, especially when you just order water to drink.

My advice, try to go to a different location for greek food.  But I still haven't food a good place for greek.  Any suggestions?

Derek"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. This place has really stepped up their game. Wasn't too long ago that the food was lacklustre and the service slow. This time around...excellent. Thanks Tony!"}
{"text":"We have had a love experience with this location.  We came for a brunch when we were too tired to cook and we sat on the patio.  It was so nice.  The souvlaki was delicious and we tried a few different items since we were in brunch mode.  Pleasantly surprised at how satisfying our meal was.  We had lovely service too.  I have a hard time ordering more than the souvlaki because I love it so much.  The portions are good and the prices are reasonable.  We have had a consistently good experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the lamb and grilled octopus and had a great meal as usual.
The tzatziki dip is a standard order for us and is delicious and imho better than in the Greek isles!

Service was very attentive (must have read the other reviews! lol!) And the food arrived quick.

Definitely worth a visit if you are craving Greek food and are in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a number of times. I always order the same thing, lamb souvlaki. I don't know why I give them the benefit of the doubt each time. When they ask me how I would like my lamb cooked I always say medium well. I should have learned from the first time but I don't. Every time I receive my meal the meat comes out well done pretty close to charred. Every time I bite into it i'm disappointed but keep returning because the service is off the wall.

The last time I went there our server was upbeat, friendly, quick, and knew how to make the customer (myself) feel at home and welcomed. I decided to order the gyros appetizer and to my surprise this was a massive portion which could easily feed 4. It came with cubes of feta and sliced tomatoes. 

All in all I have to master their idea of how they cook their meet. I nervous to order just medium because I don't want to see blood but I do enjoy a little pink."}
{"text":"I came with my family to eat a quick dinner at this location.  Only 5 tables including us.  Staffing wasn't an issue 3 servers, a bartender and the manager.  We were seated and waited and waited tables around us were being served.  The manager was leaning over the bar with his arms and not giving a care in the world about service.  After waiting for 12 minutes for someone to take my order we got up and left.  The manager didn't even care that we left unhappy.  This location might not be my first choice for Greek next time."}
