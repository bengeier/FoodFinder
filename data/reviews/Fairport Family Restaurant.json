{"text":"Nice place, nothing special. Food did not have much flavor. Clean restaurant. Did not regret eating there, but would not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"This is a small family restaurant with good service and good food. Portions were large and food came out fast. I had a melt and it was hot and full of meat and cheeses."}
{"text":"Great soup. Chicken parm and corned beef wrap were very good. Clean bathrooms. Chocolate pie was almost as good as my wife's."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with seating inside
 and outside. Parking in the back with an entrance to the restaurant in the back too. 
Service was good. Coffee was ok. Breakfast was good and portions are large. You won't leave hungry, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The perch sandwich, fisherman's platter and liver with onions were all fantastic. Salads and soups were also spot on delicious.  Real home made flavors and great service."}
{"text":"The place is in a great location.  The prices reflect are a little on the high side for what you get, but you do not have a lot of options in this area and I am sure they are banking the $$ for the winter months.  

They do server breakfast all day, except for the items that they call out on the menu as AM only.  And they apparently run out of corned beef quickly.  As you can see it is a bit frustrating.  But, once you find something that they have that you are okay with, the food is pretty good.  Service is typical: if I know you I will be friendly and stop by, if not see you when I see you.  So that is kind of a bummer.

I am sure though that if you get there early, the breakfast would be outstanding."}
{"text":"We've come here for a few years now and they have been consistently AWESOME!!! Such a good value and good food."}
{"text":"Is a pretty country restaurant, greasy spoon. Nothing special about it except for the fact that it is on the lake, and the waitstaff is pretty attractive.  It is in a fairly remote area so if you're in that area it is the best restaurant around"}
{"text":"Love this little restaurant. Have been there many times for take out and sit down for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never had a bad meal! Soups are always delish. The specials are always wonderful."}
{"text":"Generally we grab breakfast here on Sunday's as we can walk from our house - or the Cuban which is amaze balls! Two days ago I wanted a quick lunch pick up and wanted to try something different - Patty Melt on Wheat with Italian Wedding Soup on the side - craving it every day since! Only downside is that the bread gets soggy quick - we live a few blocks away and it still gets affected by the condensation - so remember to eat fast! 

Kim was incredibly helpful on deciding what to order and SO FRIENDLY!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped  by and have breakfast on a Saturday morning.
My wife and I had corn beef hash which was really good.
The corner is nothing to brag about but it's a nice little family run greasy spoon restaurant.
The prices were a little high for what the food was. My wife had a large glass of tomato juice which set us back $5.67.
Just a bit on the high side for a glass of juice."}
{"text":"I love this place currently one of my favorite places to get cheese burgers, they always taste fresh and juicy. I normally get some bacon on the burger and here they have it crispy just how I like it. I am normally not a big French fry eater but here I just love them! However the best part of this cute little restaurant a stones throw from the lighthouse has to be the staff always nice, always attentive, and very knowledgeable about what they serve even honest if it's not something they personally care for. I believe that that is a very important aspect to a waiter or waitress being able to tell you if they like the food or not and for what reason. With Fairport working to thrive again this little restaurant is worth the visit along with the shops too!"}
{"text":"A nice place for brunch on a Sunday, only a 10-15 minute wait. The service was quick and the menu was extensive. The corned beef hash was good, but the potatoes were bland. We ordered carrot cake and chocolate cream pie; I was told the carrot cake was awesome (it has nuts, so I couldn't try it) and the chocolate pie was pretty average."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here on a Saturday afternoon. We had a gift certificate and were in the area for the tall ships festival so we decided to stop here for lunch. It is a very small quaint restaurant. It was a nice day so there were people sitting out on the patio. We chose to eat inside after being in the hot sun for a couple hours. 

It is very small inside so expect a wait if you go here during prime time hours. We were lucky to get a booth right when we walked in. The staff was all polite including our waitress. She was very sweet and kept our drinks full and checked in at appropriate times.

I ordered the chicken melt sandwich. Grilled chicken Swiss cheese grilled onions on grilled rye bread. I opted for the onion rings as my side since I'm not a big fan of regular French fries. Everything was good. My sandwich could of used some mayo but I'm a sucker for jelly with my rye toast so I just spread some on and voila I was happy. I have weird eating habits so don't mind me. My mom had the club sandwich with French fries and she ate all her meal. I took half my sandwich home with me. Our meals also came with a cup of soup. It was Italian wedding that day. It was piping hot and delicious! 

Overall I would recommend this place for a quick and cheap meal but good food. I'm a big fan of local family owned restaurants. I hate chains. I support the locals!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast --especially the corned beef has which all meat ! We will be back to try dinner soon !"}
{"text":"Delish burger! Worth the visit, it was a bit greasy.  It seemed homemade,  and they ask how you like it. That's a plus! I would go back,  there were not a lot of places to get a decent bite by the lake at 2:30pm. My house salad was the classic diner side salad, and their house dressing is the bomb!"}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of place we were looking for after exploring around Headlands State Park. Friendly staff, quick service, and everything you'd hope to find on a diner menu. The portions were generous, and everything was cooked perfectly. My fianc√© and I each ordered a breakfast combo and drinks and our meal was less than $20! Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"Very good prices, quick service. Good French fries, good chicken sandwich. I'll most certainly come back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place! Nice low key place. Fast and friendly service. Delicious omelettes!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood restaurant with friendly service, great food and large portions. Like another reviewer said, this is a hidden gem. I had the chopped sirloin with eggs combo and my girlfriend had the French toast combo. Both were great."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Awesome food and good prices.  I love breakfast here, awesome pancakes."}
{"text":"This is a great little out of the way spot. The food is always served hot and the coffee is great. My husband and I have this restaurant in our rotation for best breakfasts. We enjoy their Country Skillet. Sausage, peppers, onions, scrambled eggs and sausage gravy are served atop a bed of delicious fried potatoes. The serving is large so we typically share it. Their pancakes are a nice size and come out fluffy. They have a great vanilla flavor. The staff is friendly enough without being overly attentive. You will always have your cup filled but don't expect much chit chat."}
{"text":"True family restaurant. Friendly service. Nice variety of breakfast choices plus daily specials. Portions won't let you leave hungry. All in all a good spot for breakfast. A lighting consultant would be a good investment, but other than that, it is hard to find a complaint."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the soup and the outside setting was nice however the service was very slow. Also my daughter ate salmon which was quite dry and over clubs which probably why took so long I would suggest sticking to the sandwiches and fries if you need here it's plus it's enough but not if you're in a hurry"}
{"text":"My wife and I had stayed a few miles away from Fairport Harbor when we were traveling to Indiana and the day we checked out of our hotel we needed a good place to eat.  We were very fortunate that a local couple directed us to this restaurant for a good meal.

I ended up getting a French toast breakfast platter with a side of biscuits and gravy which were absolutely amazing.  My wife got your standard pancake breakfast which was also delicious.  The prices were fair and the location was pretty easy to find.

The only thing that kind of through me off was the parking and entrances.  They can be a little confusing as we found ourselves walking around the whole building when we could have walked in the back.

All in all, a nice place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here a few times when I loved in the area the staff are always friendly. It seems like it's well taken care of and clean the foods not bad full menu all day long I liked the fried chicken dinner as well as eggs and toast with ham."}
