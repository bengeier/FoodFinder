{"text":"The plethora of Korean restaurants in this area always has me looking for ones I haven't tried yet!   We came here as a group for an early dinner one weekend. It was a little difficult to communicate the dietary restrictions for one of us because the servers' English weren't very good, but they were very nice and accommodating about it.   We ordered a few larger dishes to share as a group:  - Pork bone soup (hot pot, supposed to serve 2-3 people): Flavour was pretty good. Really liked that they put a lot of sprouts in it, but the pork bones were not very meaty.  - Goat stew: Not bad! A couple people were afraid this would be too gamey but it wasn't. Stew was a little spicy.   - Braised beef rib (large): Everyone's favourite dish of the night. The beef was super tender and fell right off the bone.   Overall, pretty good! I'll keep this restaurant in mind next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had the pork belly Korean BBQ here with their electric grill on the table. The meat quality was pretty good, thick cuts. But everything else was below average. The side dishes are not substantial (pickled cabbage for example) and not that tasty. No side soups were provided with the pork BBQ which is usually provided. Overall the experience was subpar."}
{"text":"It was alright, there were a lot from things that were on the menu but was not available. We went here because majority of the restaurants around were not open until later that day. Service was good, she tried to help us decide on what to eat. I don't think I'd come back, maybe for their ace since we didn't have it for lunch; but overall experience was just okay."}
{"text":"Korean food for lunch is one of my ritual when I take the car in for service in that neighborhood.   Today I decided to try out different Korean restaurant in the area. Our lunch order: Grilled mackerels with Tofu Soup ($11.99), Pork Bone Soup ($8.99), Korean Sausage Soup ($7.99).  All items are served with a bowl of rice.  Mini bowls of congee appetizer were brought to the table after we placed our order.  The side dishes and most dishes are on par and as expected with most Korean restaurants. Of special mention is the Korean sausage soup (my first time ordering this dish) and it is a medley of lung slices,  pig ear slices, sausages filled with liver and chap chae pieces, and slices of an organ which I can't seem to identify in a non spicy beef broth. Definitely not something for the faint of heart - there are no hearts in the soup as far as I can tell. :)"}
{"text":"I actually expected very good taste food because my friend recommend this place but seems like the kitchen chef changed.  They have variety of menu with good price. I got a spicy seafood soup.  Taste was good but not stella.  My complaint about this place is so slow service.  It took more than 10min to get my drink even it was not busy.  And also took another 15min to get my meal.    They need to be improved on their customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the goat stew and it was just meh. Only four side dishes too which isn't special.   You can park at the food basics plaza for free. Ample parking!"}
{"text":"Good selection of meats. Side dishes were okay. I wish they had pickled radish and garlic for the Korean bbq."}
{"text":"Haroo is definitely an improvement over Seoul Street (The establishment before Haroo). I'm guessing it's under new management thankfully.  Pros: Decor is very nice Food is well done  Cons: Some entrees don't come with rice  I remember coming here before it was Haroo and it was mediocre at best.  I had no intention of ever coming back until my GF noticed it was now Haroo and wanted to give it a try.  It's a good thing we did because this place is vastly improved.  I can definitely see myself coming here more often since it's close to where I live as well.  As soon I came in, I noticed the decor has been redone.  It looks very nice compared to it's past iteration.  It's the same plan, table bbq in the front and some regular tables in the back.  It looks very nice and subtle.  It's a very comfortable setting that you can easily be used for a family outing or a group night out.      I ordered the braised beef rib as that's always my favourite at a Korean restaurant should they have it.  My GF ordered the chicken udon bowl.  My entree doesn't come with rice which is a little disappointing.  I'm finding more and more Korean places adopting this process.  It's not a deal breaker but paying an extra $2 just for rice kinda sucks. The ribs were very tender except for one piece.  They were very good tasting bursting with flavour.  My GF's udon was very well done.  My little one's favourite is noodles so if she loved it, they have to be good.  The service is very good here.  It's much better than what I remember from the last place.  It feels like they knew about the last place and made it an emphasis to improve on everything that was wrong from then.  If I have anything else to gripe about, it would just be the side dishes.  They could of been done a little better.   All in all, Haroo is definitely a great Korean restaurant.  I will definitely be back to try the table bbq.  I saw a table having it and looked absolutely delish!!"}
{"text":"Had supper for five last night and we really enjoyed it. The service was friendly and fast. Our server helped with some selections for our family so we did not order too much. We had age dashing tofu, fried herring, gyoza, tempura moriawase (which had my daughter gasp when brought to table), and seared tuna salad to start. The presentation really was lovely and all was delicious. Then we decided on sushi platters and tried Korean beef tatare. All delicious! For five it was only $125 including a bottle of soju.  I would go back again next time we are in the area for sure to try the hot pot or bbq."}
{"text":"It's a fairly new restaurant along Yonge street (before reaching Steeles Ave. beside food basics) and it did not disappoint. The restaurant is really clean with good interiors. They have friendly staff that were really accommodating - up to the point that they will even cut the meat in front of us.   Everytime I visit a Korean restaurant, I always go after their jjampong and seafood tofu soup - and I must say that this restaurant's version of the 2 aforementioned  dishes were really good! Just the right amount of spiciness, which I really love! I would also like to mention that they serve their jjampong with thin noodles (linguine-like), which i prefer rather than the thick ones - it's good for sharing too!   I will definitely come back! It's worth the try!"}
{"text":"In this review, I will be making comparisons to the two previous restaurants of the same location before this. I gave five stars to Todamgol and it has been my favorite Korean restaurant. When it changed hand, probably due to retirement, it changed to Seoul Street and got operated poorly with terrible service that deserved a one star.   Stepping into Haroo, I have noticed the same floor plan as before. However, the interior decoration is so far the best among them. The service is casual but still attentive. But it is hard to say if it will stay the same as it get busier; as Seoul street has probably lost all the customer base built by Todamgol already.  The menu became more English and Chinese friendly. Also there are more varieties of menu items yet also a more simplified menu. Making it easy to order and understand what you are getting. However, the restaurant has not offer any drinking combo menu but instead have a lunch special menu.   Korean side dish is moderate in term of amount of five dishes. Can't compare to Todamgol 10 dishes side dishes. But they look and taste decent. The pan-fried mackerel is not over salty nor oily, which I really enjoyed it. The soup that comes with the naengmyeon (cold noodle - I know it is almost winter...)  actually tasted very good, made me want to come back for soup next time.  Unfortunately, I rarely eat naengmyeon, so I can't rate how tasty the naengmyeon. It is good, but I don't have a good comparison to rate it well. Perhaps I will add to this review the next time I try my favorite dishes.  At the time being, I will give this a 4 stars based on this experience."}
{"text":"Haroo may now be one of my favourite Korean Restaurant in the area. If you are interested in well prepared authentic Korean dish, I highly recommend Haroo.  Braised Beef Rib ($15.99) ???? is just so good. The meat so well flavoured and melt in your mouth tender.   Lunch Special though limited in choices but does comes with either s a combo of grilled fish and soup or just the soup alone for a decent price.  Winter is here and I can't wait to come back for some hot pot soup or even another order of beef rib which is just the perfect comfort food!"}
{"text":"I was  a fan of the prior korean restaurant in this location and this one is definitely still very decent for my liking.   Pro: 1. You can park in the parking lot of food basic 2. They separate the bbq tables and non bbq tables in different sections. As a non bbqer, I prefer this over many other korean restaurants which mix all together.   Cons Nothing obvious  I have tried a few dishes here and the pork bone soup is the best. Grilled mackerel is also good.  The other dishes I tried include seafood tofu, ribs with aged kim chi, seafood pancake. They were all average, nothing stands out.  Therefore if you crave for Pork Bone Soup, you should go here."}
