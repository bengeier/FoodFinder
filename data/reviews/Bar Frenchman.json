{"text":"We ate dinner here on 04-Nov-2017 and the experience was fantastic! While the food was delightful, the cocktails and wine were even better -- and the service was phenomenal. Our waiter (can't remember his name because of the cocktails, but he was relatively new to Pittsburgh from Denver), knew all of the menus inside-and-out, was enthusiastic about the choices, and gave us great advice. We loved every single minute here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's difficult to reconcile the comments in the negative reviews with our experience this past Thursday, the 14th. From start to finish, the entire evening was as fine an example of stellar food, service and atmosphere as one could find pretty much anywhere.  Our party of four drooled over (well, not literally, but there was a lot of lip-smacking, \"OMG\" and \"you have to try this\" remarks) the escargot, fois gras and salmon starters and the venison frites, duck a l'orange, coq au vin and cassoulet entrees.  Devon was a knowledgeable and attentive waiter and Vanessa was very helpful in choosing the right wine. Executive chef and owner Drew Garbarino visited our table and his passion for his work was evident. We had nothing at all to quibble about and left happy and thinking about the next time."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night. Service was superb. Food was excellent as well. We split the salmon roulettes, escargot and oysters. These were prepared well and were delicious. As appetizers we had steak (flat iron) frites and cassoulet. The steaks were prepared as ordered and the frites were crispy on the outside and soft inside, perfect. The cassoulet was very good with what I believe was crispy kale on top. The apple cake for dessert was also very good. All in all a very delightful dinner. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The bar looked very nice as well and the cocktail menu looked great."}
{"text":"We went to dinner during the 2nd week of their grand opening. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and smelled brand new inside. Our server was very attentive and even asked at the beginning of our dinner if the chef should be concerned with any food allergies, which was a nice touch.   They still do not have their liquor license yet, so it was BYOB. We were given two free cocktails which were both delicious.   The escargot appetizer had great tasting ramps grits and mushrooms, although, the escargot itself lacked a little in flavor. I ordered the coq au vin as my entree and my husband ordered the smoked duck. We both agreed the smoked duck was the better of the two dishes. You could really taste the smoke and the mustard emulsion was quite tasty. Overall, a fairly good dinner and service for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"were very excited to come here. Expect very slow, poor service. 20 minutes to make a cocktail, 15 minutes for a glass of wine.the waiter delivered one appetizer 15 minutes after the others, lobster pot pie was nothing but mashed potatoes in a bowl with two tiny pieces of lobster and some phyllo for laid on top. Plarea were not regularly cleared. Another 20 plus minutes to get our check, which was incorrect. 20% gratuity automatically added which is good because I would have given much less. As a foodie, I do not recommend coming here. Run."}
{"text":"Gotta tell you. Been here a few weeks before and was good. This was worst meal I've had. Had several friends at different tables and they thought mediocre at best. My food was dry and over cooked! I ordered the same meal that I had a few weeks before. It was like eating sawdust! I asked Chris the manager if he had a new chef and he said nothing has changed.  He never apologized. Chef never came out. Do not eat here. Horrible."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Bartender was very helpful. Great wine. Great cocktail menu. I had the chicken and foie Gras.  My wife had pasta. They seemed to be short staffed somewhat which could be an issue on Saturday nights, but the staff worked well together to get our food out on time. Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"We visited Bar Frenchman with the highest expectation because of how much we love The Twisted Frenchman! It turns out that it's the same day (9/15) that this restaurant got its liquor license. So although I didn't get my pinot noir and had to wait for a few more minutes for my champagne to chill (it was worth the wait!), I believe it will be fully stocked from today on. :)   We started with foie gras (of course we did...) - it was absolutely AMAZING! Not only did it melt in our mouths, it had just the perfect balance of richness from the foie gras and the sweetness and acidity from the raisins. It was our favorite dish of the night without doubt. We then chose the smoked duck and the grilled prawns for our entrees. The duck had great flavored, but a tad on the dry side (some parts were a little difficult to chew); my bf disagreed - he loved the duck. :P We finished the meal with walnut chocolate brownies with vanilla ice cream; it was the only dessert option and was actually pretty tasty.   In the end, I'm giving it a 4 but my bf said it's a 5, so really it should be a 4.5. :) We are definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"After a bit of confusion on my part we got reservations at Bar Frenchman. I mistakenly reserved a table upstairs at the Twisted Frenchman, but straightening it out when they called to confirm. It is a bit confusing.  Everything about Bar Frenchman was great. The dining room is newly renovated space which is modern, clean, and open. The noise level is moderate -  just right. Service was outstanding, paced perfectly, with a server who was knowledgeable, responsive, and personable. It's a typical French bistro menu, with limited choices but enough diversity to satisfy most diners. The food was perfect. We shared the beet salad and ordered a pasta entre and the filet version of steak frites. We also splurged on the shaved truffles on both entres. There is also a nice bread service. The wines are, understandably, all French. The selections are well conceived with prices that are surprisingly reasonable. It was a very good experience and we will definitely return and also try the Twisted, upstairs."}
{"text":"Went tonight for a birthday celebration and our server Thomas was nothing short of spectacular. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and it's different options. He gladly offered his recommendations and explained them a bit further to us. We ordered the Foie Gras for an appetizer to split. It was amazing. Very well prepared. For entrees I got the Coq Au Vin which was good a little on the salty side and the rooster was alittle tough but overall very satisfying. My husband order the filet with frites. Exceptionally prepared and from what I tasted it was seasoned perfectly. We got the chocolate coffee dessert to end the evening. Thomas our server brought it out with a little candle for my birthday which was a nice touch. Overall I would highly recommend. Food was amazing and service was top notch."}
{"text":"Great meal at the bar. Bartender was knowledgeable and attentive, food and drinks quite good. He refused to charge me for a beer that he recommended which wasn't to my taste, as well as soup because they were out of my original choice. Certainly customer service is the focus, but the food is worthwhile even without it. I will certainly return for what was an overall pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"This review is about service, plain and simple. It irritates me to have to write this review, but it's the truth, and if I were the owner I'd want to know. Also, the service experience upstairs (the new Twisted Frenchman) was not reflective of the bar Frenchman. We've now experienced both and can say that they are worlds apart.   The fact is, if you have high end prices, and serve high end food, you need to have high end service.   Let me get the good stuff out of the way first.   1) The drinks were great, excellent in fact (and for $6 a piece at Happy Hour, one of the best deals in town), considering the Hidden Harbor background this wasn't a surprise   2) The traditional French bar food of mussels and fries was very good as well. The French bread (I hesitate to say baguette) and side of butter was a nice touch.   3) The vibe, decor, music and glassware was well balanced and tasteful. What a great place this will hopefully become.   Now, on to the service which caused an easy 4 stars to slip to almost a single star.   1) When someone orders club soda, but you only offer bottled sparkling at a charge, you should say so in advance before opening the bottle and pouring a glass. ($2 charge)  2) When someone asks for a side of mayo, and you bring what you later claim was truffle oil aioli at an up charge, you should say so in advance ($1 upcharge)  3) When someone asks if the $6 cocktails apply to the *all* the cocktails and you say yes, you should say in advance which one of the house cocktails is *not* part of the Happy Hour *before* someone orders and drinks it. ($9 upcharge)  4) When the bill arrives and someone asks for clarification on the 2 unknown upcharges (we'll let the club soda slide), you should be polite and courteous, rather than copping an attitude and letting customers sit and wait without any communication about the resolution   This is all quite a shame. Considering the place was pretty dead on a Friday night and is still brand new, and considering it is competing with the very popular S. Highland establishments (all had 30-60 minute waits at this time) I would think that you don't have the luxury of delivering service at this low level.   What's also surprising is this person's resume! The ties to the very excellent Hidden Harbor was something we were looking forward to! But, the big problem is we probably won't be coming back because of her! And if this level of service continues, we won't be the only ones!"}
{"text":"I actually sent feedback to the restaurant, as I prefer to do, before posting but it was ignored. There are so many things to like about this place. Our server was lovely. The complimentary pretzel bread was delish. Our table, a high top right by the kitchen, was out of the noise. My daughter's salmon rillette was yummy. But there were also things to not like. My expensive lobster salad app was barely more than a heaping tablespoon of shredded lobster. The window into the kitchen behind our table was broken and the strap of duct tape they had up as a barrier kept catching at my daughter's hair, which was uncomfortable and gross (if we had moved the table back we'd have blocked the spiral staircase). But perhaps the least favorite thing was that three of us got the steak frites and we all found the room-temp steak (the special dry-aged ribeye) underseasoned and flaccid and the fries bland as well. The serve of aioli with the fries was so paltry and in a huge souffle cup, which was awkward because you had to dig down to get it. The best part of my meal (besides our amazing server) was the rice pudding and the really good wine. Don't waste your time on the cocktail for two, it was overpriced and gimmicky.  I love the Twisted Frenchman and I really wanted to love this place, too. But not hearing back from them and the expensive, not very good entrees make me hesitate to try it again."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood! Bar Frenchman is the downstairs bar and lounge of the newly relocated and renovated Twisted Frenchman. As of last week, they were still working on getting their liquor license transferred, but the bar at BF is ready to go.  We stopped for a quick bite and found the food delicious. My husband had the sea bass and loved it.  I had the ratatouille with gnocchi. It is served as a small plate but was still more than I could finish. The gnocchi were light and melted in your mouth.  We will be back soon. The staff are all attentive and friendly. The bar in Bar Frenchman is huge and will accommodate many hungry drinkers."}
{"text":"Never try mussels!!! The ambience is great and the Location is good. The Decor and the style is nice.  The bartenders are outstanding with good collection of drinks and good service. What I do not expect from that quality of  bar/ restaurant was problems with food and also inability to make some drinks secondary to low supply of specific spirits. That is why I did not give the fifth star.  We went  on a Friday night after work around 8 PM and we did not have reservations.  We sat at the bar stools  by the window. We did not have a dedicated servant but the barman  was kind enough to came out to help us. After we decided on the drinks with his help and because they were out of specific items to make the drinks on the menu  he created something  else that was really good. So far so good. He offered us  the dinner menu to order. We decided to go with muscles and frites. Everything looked great until the smell from the plate or muscles saturated the air. It smelled like dead animal. I tried  calling them back  and after a while someone came to us. They gave us the following explanation: \" Our muscles are fresh and  have distinct smell\". What smell? Rotten dead animal? And she stated that they come from an island? Which island? I am sorry but this is unacceptable in a kitchen of a chef! This is actually ridiculous! I've eaten muscles  all over  Europe eg Brussels and America.  When the muscle  have smell they actually are not supposed to be eaten.I asked them  to take them back and they did  offer to bring something else ( We got the lobster salad that was very mediocre)and They remove that item from our check. Sorry Chef I won't be coming back to your kitchen!!!!! The presentation was good you may see picture below"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch today. We were seated promptly and given water. From there though, it took a long time to get asked about our drink and food orders. We did not get our food for 80 minutes after we were seated. There was only 4 other parties in the restaurant. Food was average for brunch."}
{"text":"Simply stellar. We came here last night on a much-deserved \"date night\" without the kids at a friend's recommendation - the entire evening was perfect.  Yes, they have just opened, and are working out a few small details (table needed a little wedge to keep it level on the super-cool 100 year old tile mosaic floor, another diner seemed to go nuts because the wait staff didn't bring him new silverware within a nanosecond of dropping his fork on the floor) but this should NOT discourage you and your palate from getting to this place ASAP to try it!  Space: The theme is \"French Bistro\" meets \"Trendy Bar\" and they do it oh, so very well. Despite being a cool, hip industrial-appearing interior, we liked how the seating was arranged and how the staff managed to expertly wait on the growing number of eager patrons being seated. Music and noise are somewhat more pronounced, given that they feature a super-cool 100 year old mosaic tile floor and fairly Spartan artwork / wall coverings. The high ceilings help, but this place will definitely be hopping on the weekends when the kids come out to play!!  Food: Now, let's face it, you don't come to a place like this just to look at the floors and walls, do you? You come to a restaurant like this to experience the incredible creativity and flavors presented by the Chef and his team. This is where Bar Frenchman completely knocks it out of the park! As we typically do with newer restaurants, my wife and I decided to make a meal out of several of their appetizers - \"tapas\" style. It's a great way to try lots of things and notice little details about the vision of a particular Chef, we think. Well, Chef Garbarino and Crew did not disappoint! Presentation was beautiful - try the salmon rilette if you want a little twist on lox and cream cheese - it's cold-smoked salmon with creme fraiche served in a nice little glass container with cold smoke. The smoke was perfect, and did not overpower the fish - it was there to expand the flavor and experience, and it succeeded. We found our beet salad, beef tartare, escargots, and foie gras to be equally enthralling and deliciously prepared and presented.  Drinks: We loved everything, especially my \"Two Drink Minimum\" cocktail with a lovely Rye whisky base evolving into an Old Fashioned as the ice sphere melts, releasing Peychaud Bitters, Angostura Bitters, and some other nice things into the drink. The wine list is nice and well-picked to compliment the menu items. Our server was definitely able to nail pairings with our dining choices. We found their Saint-Estephe paired extremely well with the rich escargots and foie gras; you should try it.  Dessert: Don't forget about them! While they do not have an enormous focus on dessert, we had both of their offerings - a pear cake / syrup dish and a really rich and delicious brownie with Vietnamese coffee ice cream. Delicious. I only wish they had espresso to go with them - they do have pretty tasty French press coffee, but oh, how lovely it would be to finish the meal off with a piping hot shot of high quality espresso!  Go here. Now. You'll love it. You can thank me later. You're welcome!  Will DEFINITELY be back, and very, very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the local restaurants.  The room is large and has black walls and ceiling with a long bar along the one wall.  It was busy.  The room is dark after sunset and many were using their phone flashlight to read the menu.   The wine list is really nice.  Some interesting selections both by the bottle and glass.  If you need assistance, someone can help you select.    We started with Grilled Whole Prawns with a beet root cocktail sauce.   The prawns were very good and the beet root sauce was oh so good.  For an entree I had the Smoked duck that was perfectly cooked.  The duck come with figs and haricots verts that were a great accompaniment. While service was pretty good, a little shaky at times.  Probably due to the recent opening and learning.  We were never offered any desert menu or desert option."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner recently and weren't too hungry. We wanted to try all of Bar Frenchman's appetizers though, so we ordered all four appetizers: cheese board, steak tartare, foie gras, and escargot. We were a little disappointed by some of these, but for the most part the dishes were decent. The cheese board was pretty good (but there was a lot more cheese and spread than crackers), and the steak tartare was quite tasty. I thought the foie gras was okay. My boyfriend liked it better than I did. The escargot was my least favorite of the four appetizers. The snails were extremely bland, but at least the grits had flavor.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 4 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the the original Twisted Frenchman and was excited to check out Bar Frenchman for Restaurant Week.   Unfortunately, the experience turned out to be an enormous disappointment. Many of my favorite dishes were not on the menu (such as a the mustard-seasoned duck breast) and the foie gras was prepared so poorly I had difficulty finishing it (I miss the compote they served it with at the original restaurant). The foie now sits on a soggy bread and is dressed in a sour and off-putting line of cream sauce.   Bar Frenchman is a remarkable expansion from the original with at least 4x as many servers and twice as many chefs. I think they expanded too quickly and the standard of the food has suffered. The presentation of my salmon entree sloppy and many components (such as the lentils) were not cooked properly. Unfortunately, I think the quality of the food has been compromised and I doubt that Chef Andrew has the capacity now to oversee all the dishes coming out of his kitchen. I'm sure if he'd paid closer attention, he'd be just as crest-fallen.   I may try the chef's tasting menu at some point in the future, but I certainly don't have any plans to order off the Bar Frenchman menu anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that Bar Frenchman was offering brunch and I get that a new service takes time to work out the kinks but even with that in mind this was a stretch.  When we arrived, there were only a few other tables occupied. We were seated right away and asked what type of water we preferred by the hostess...tap, nothing fancy. Twenty minutes later we stopped a server to ask if someone was planning on taking care of us. A guy came over to bring the water with no introduction and took orders for cocktails. The bloody marys with blah with little flavor and just a celery stalk thrown in. We ordered meals and another round of waiting began for the starters. The seasonal crepes were not freshly made. The crepes appeared to be pre-made shells topped with berries and creme. Plates cleared and another round of waiting... About twenty minutes between each course. Luckily my friends and I had a lot to catch up on...  Entrees were a bit more excitingly prepared but when we asked for the check it took another ice age to receive it, have it ran and returned. Almost three hours in a nearly empty restaurant with poor service can feel like a lifetime. My rule of thumb is to give any place two tries and this was my second disappointment here."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great drinks and excellent service.  I think they can definitely improve on the acoustics as it tends to be kind of loud for conversation, but the food quality and presentation was top notch.   Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This had been on my list for a while and ended up coming during restaurant week (unintentionally, but a good thing!). I think it's really cool there's two concepts with the fancy Twisted Frenchman upstairs and the more casual Bar Frenchman. To be honest, the bar program is really what drew me in here, because looking at all the pretty cocktail pictures they post on social enticed me!   I really wanted the steak and frites, but noticed it wasn't marked as a gluten free option, per the menu, so I went with the potato leek soup and chicken with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. I don't order chicken at restaurants often because it's usually tasteless and dry. This was neither! It was very tasty, seasoned right and succulent. The pairing of the sides was great. To be honest, it was a hearty portion of 4 pieces of chicken. I could have subtracted a piece of chicken for a little more of the sides. The most important thing though was that it was a tasty dish and the soup was the perfect starter. It was perfect, and probably one of the best soups I've ever had.   After talking with chef Drew, apparently most items you can make gluten free easily, you just need to ask. Good to know for the next time, because I'm hankering for a great steak and frites! Our server was SUPER friendly and helpful with my dietary requests. He literally took every precaution to ensure there wouldn't be any cross contamination and I'm eternally grateful, because I didn't get sick after, so I know it was safe!   The bar didn't let me down! Greta (the bartender extraordinaire) treated us to a little eggnog concoction. I am not a fan of eggnog, but it was seriously killer. Not too sweet and just the right amount of all the ingredients. I can't wait to come back and sit at the bar and order snacks and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night - and it was a great experience from start to finish. Reservations are easy to make on Open Table, and it was great to see the restaurant packed on a Friday night - I love East Liberty and its revival!  I started with the Caesar salad - a generous portion indeed. Slightly overdressed, but the leftover dressing was easily sopped up by the warm bread for the table.  My main course was really the star - cassoulet. The beans were well seasoned and yet retained a bite - not mushy but not raw - definitely a challenging texture to accomplish in the kitchen. There were nice portions of Duck and pork mixed in with the beans, although I felt like there could have been more meat for the price point. Overall, a well seasoned, comforting dish!  The wine selection is good, and our waiter was helpful in guiding us towards cocktails depending on our spirit of choice, and flavor profile - sweet, sour, etc.  Overall - a great experience, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying new places.  We were very excited to try Bar Frenchman.  We stopped in around 6:00pm on a Friday night and there were only about 6 or 7 people sitting at the bar.  The bartender who was inexplicably wearing a Hawaiian shirt (??) came over to us and showed us the menus and explained Happy Hour.  I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and my husband ordered one of the special cocktails.  I got my wine quickly but my husband waited close to 15 minutes for his cocktail.    There were two bartenders who were looking very harried and stressed out for some reason (the place really was not busy at all) and they were doing their best not to make eye contact with us.  When my husband finally received his cocktail, there was no apology or explanation, it was just kind of thrown at him.  We wanted to order several things off the menu and share and we were super hungry!  After my husband got his drink, all bets were off and we were really blatantly being ignored.  I tried to be polite and just try to get the attention of one of the bartenders when I just lightly raised my hand and said excuse me.  The other bartender (not the one in the Hawaiian shirt) finally looked at me and I just said, sorry, we just wanted to order some food when you get a chance.  He literally snapped at me in a very loud voice, I'll be with you as soon as I can, ma'am!!  My husband and I both kind of reared back and looked at each other in shock! Lol!  I felt like I was reprimanded!  After that, we finally ordered (another 10 to 15 minutes later) and waited for our food.  We ordered the pretzel bread, cheese board, and the confit fingerling potatoes which were all absolutely delicious.  However, no one ever stopped by to see how we were doing, checked to see if we were enjoying our food, or if we needed another drink or anything else.  My husband had an empty beer bottle (he hurried up and ordered a beer with our food in case he didn't get another chance!  He didn't want to get yelled at too!) and probably could have used another drink but no one offered and we certainly couldn't ask!  Finally, we finished our food and drank our water and we decided just to leave.  We would've liked more food and drinks but it wasn't worth trying to interact with the bartenders who were clearly annoyed and having a hard time.  It did start to get a little more busy so we knew it was only going to get worse.  What's interesting is we recognized one of the bartenders from The Commoner in the Hotel Monaco, downtown.  The Commoner has excellent service, so we were really surprised at how rude and terrible this service was.  We've received better service at Eat n Park when ordering a couple of super burgers!  When we finally got the bill and had our credit card run through, (also after putting our credit card on the edge of the bar to get someone's attention) they ended up charging us for a beet salad we didn't order.  We had to wait again for that to be rectified which would have normally been fine if the rest of the evening hadn't been so crappy.  It's just frustrating because it's a Friday night, we worked hard all week, and we wanted to enjoy a nice evening.  Being rudely yelled at by a bartender was not in our plans!  Also, at Bar Frenchman's price point, the service should be impeccable...friendly at the very least?"}
