{"text":"Went there Friday evening. Food and service was excellent and presented better than most other celebrity restaurants. The karaoke mc made the place even more fun. We are locals and will go back. Btw thank you for no parking fees for anyone"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Horrible food. Not enough servers.

We were hungry. So, we went to there for lunch. Friend and I ordered 2 burgers. One was with fried egg sunny side up, and the other was plain. Both were ordered medium. We had to wait 5 minutes until a server can get our drink order. Another long wait for 2 waters and sodas. And, another long wait until she can get our food order. After a long wait for our food, we thought it might be tasty. Mine was ok. But, the other burger was crap. The egg was not sunny side up, it was fried. The burger meat was rare and cold. When we notified our server after another long wait, the server argued with us that is how medium is done at their place. After this argument, they gave us replacement burger, the patty was at medium. But, the egg was not sunny side up again. How can they screw up an egg order, I don't know. The price is not worth the crap service and crap food. Avoid this place. Better bet is MCD in circus circus."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Waited for a waitress for 15 minutes. Waiting for drinks for another 15 minutes. She messed up my order and took it back. Ordered a catfish po boy she brings me catfish dinner. Chef took catfish and put it in a bun. Soggy and no flavor"}
{"text":"Didn't get to try the food, still waiting on my ice water with 2 servers and 3 other tables in the restaurant...menu looked cool, wanted to try the appetizer sampler and one of the delicious burger selection, but 25 mins after being sat on a slow morning, we got up and left. Ciao:-)"}
{"text":"The food was decently priced and delicious.  Fun atmosphere.  Service could use a little work but not a deal breaker.  I had the steak salad.  The steak was beautiful and delicious. The salad, although a little tangy, was yummy as well. It took a while for us to be seated because the person who was seating us was doing shots with other guest's."}
{"text":"Sal the manager is a model leader. His professionalism coupled with his genuine interest about our dinning experience was excellent. Its refreshing to know there are real managers out there who run a business/restaurant/store like it is there own. 

The food we ate was great. (Wings/burger)

It's was karaoke night and the whole crowd was into it."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! We had the breakfast platter: 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 bacons for only $8.99. AWESOME DEAL!!! The pancakes were yummy and the eggs were cooked as requested (over easy) The bacon was EXCELLENT. My husband and brother asked for the breakfast burrito with country potatoes and they loved it!!! I will DEFINETELY be coming back here and recommend this restaurant to everyone!! MOTLEY CRUE ROCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, the Nachos were great. That's all the food we had, atmosphere was good.  Don't do the oyster shooters, canned oysters, not good!!!   The Tatuado Tequila shots we tried were bad, sort of tasted like vodka.  Some one there needs to taste that stuff, the bartenders didn't even know what it was supposed to taste like. The Margaritas were decent, have had a lot better though."}
{"text":"Quite honestly, we weren't too shocked at the mediocrity considering it's located in the Circus Circus. Cool decor but no music! No music! What!? Videos were playing but you could barely hear the tunes. That place should be rocking 24/7. 

The service was very friendly so that's a definite plus. 

Overall I give the place 3 stars but I have to admit the Vince Hombre Burger was 5 stars! It has chorizo in the patty and that has changed my life!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the sweet 80's decor! So here goes my rant! I am a server and I hate to say it, but I expect decent service! I'm not asking anyone to bend over backwards or anything, but the least you could do is ask me how my food is! When I first got there my son and I waited about 5 minutes, there was no host in sight and I didn't see a sign, so I assumed it was maybe seat yourself! After 3 people passed us and after about 10minutes, I finally stopped someone and asked if there was a host and they said yes! So I apologized for seating myself and they got me a menu! When I asked what beers they had on tap the guy had no idea and had to look! So I asked what beer the mad dog was! I was told its a black ipa and then a black lager! When it came, it was just a plain lager and it wasn't very good (I am kinda a beer snob tho, I'm from Oregon)! Lol! That not there fault, but the fact he didn't know what he was talking about at all was kinda a bad sign! At the same time I ordered my beer, I also ordered my sons grilled chz! I got my beer and waited over 5 minutes before they came back to take my order! After putting in my order, we waited about 20 more minutes for our food! This restaurant was not busy at all, maybe 1/4 full! After a good 20 minutes, finally my sons (who is super hungry) grilled chz came out! Really over 20 minutes for grilled chz! The plate was way to hot for a small child, but the chz on the inside was cold! That can only mean one thing....,it sat in the window the whole time! Keep in mind I ordered it early so I could feed my child before my food came! Then just a couple minutes later here comes my burger! The burger was ok, not worth what I paid for and the grilled chz was ok, 2 thick pieces of bread with maybe 2 thin slices of cheese! As we were sitting there waiting for our food, I was digging all the 80s music and the videos they had to go along with it! Then all of a sudden the music switched to this remixed new aged 80s crap, but the videos stayed the same! So the music didn't line up with the videos anymore! I was pissed at that point and ready to leave! We went there for the love of the 80s, not new aged mixed 80s crap!!! So we ate our food and no one asked us how it was, as I finished my burger I saw our server eating! I guess I hope his food was good! I guess I should have served him and asked! I had to ask the bartender for a box and a different server for the check! We never saw our original server again! It really sucked! I strongly don't recommend eating here! YI regretted not going to subway! It was that bad! I wish I would have saved my $30!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews, everything about it was great! My mom is not a huge fan of steak, but even she loved it and wants to come back! Our waiter Joseph was awesome, the food was all super delicious! The steak was 10,000 times better than steak I've had at a high end restaurant in Los Angeles. Will definitely dine here again! Plus, to make things even better, they play 80's heavy metal videos on tv's all over ;)"}
{"text":"Been sitting here 20 minutes, only a few people here, still waiting for a waitress to show up and ask if I wanted a drink or food."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon steak dinner for two with a bottle of wine. We ordered the rockin' nachos for an appetizer and were pleased with the portion size and the taste. Almost a meal in itself. The steak (NY strip) was decent, nothing like you'd expect at a steak house but better than average. The plate came with steak fries and sauteed zucchini as sides. Delish. The wine was a bottle of Tisdale that you can find locally for $3.99. We had the cremé brulee for dessert. It was nothing special as it was served warm with a center that was still cold and solid like custard, which let us know that these desserts are kept in the fridge and microwaved when ordered. Overall we thought the food and the wine were a good value even for the regular price. The food and service is the reason for 3 stars. Otherwise it would be less because of how our Vince Neil expectations devolved.

Being a big Crüe fan, I was glad to see 80's hair band rock videos being played when we walked in at 3:15pm. With Skid Row's 18 and life on the screen I knew I was in the right joint. Rock memorabilia on the walls added to the flavor and decor. However our rock experience took a huge detour at 4pm. That's when country music hit the big screen. We thought maybe it was just part of the random music selection, but after the 3rd video in a row from the same group we asked the waiter what happened to the rock videos. He proceeded to tell us that the videos were being played by the manager because that's the music SHE likes. We said YIKES!  We asked him to ask her to change it and he said he would tell her, but what followed was 3 more videos of the same band (a total of 6 in a row) and a continuing onslaught of country crap until we left just before 5pm!! We couldn't get out of there fast enough. Our ears were bleeding with songs about dogs and trucks and broken heart twang. There's plenty of country bar and grills in this town, Vince Neil's Tatuado doesn't need to be one of them. Go for the food but leave before 4pm, at least on Wednesdays. Don't think we'll be back. Sorry Vince."}
{"text":"So, I randomly chose this restaurant based on a Groupon deal. It wasn't the worst decision I've ever made. We were seated right away, and our waiter was  very friendly and attentive. The food came out very quickly and was cooked as we ordered. It was good. I like the fact that they hire people with tattoos. This place needs more people to visit it!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick hand of blackjack and a drink-or-two. Tatuado has two casino adjacent bars, neither of which was filled with customers, notwithstanding a moderately-sized gaming customer crowd (on a Wednesday!)

We stopped by the u-shaped bar and ordered a near beer and a vodka cranberry.  I'm pretty certain that the near beer had more alcohol than the vodka cranberry.  The waitress looked bored to death and barely could muster the energy or enthusiasm to take our order or serve our drinks. After plunking down our drinks and refusing to engage us in any conversation beyond taking the order, the waitress wandered away to her cash register.

We decided to have a second drink (hopefully with some actual booze!) at the second bar just off the mid-stakes table games section. The bar tender was a muscle-bound meathead who was in deep conversation with some multi-color-haired skank, and we assumed that he'd break off trying to make time with the skank to pour us a few.  Nope.

We waited for about a minute-or-so, but the bar tender didn't break conversation with the skank, so we walked away. You'd think that someone working for tips would keep at least 1 eye on his bar, but this fellow had his back to us the entire time we were seated waiting for a little Las Vegas hospitality.  He wasn't even behind his counter, so it's no wonder he had no idea we were there.

While the $11 steak and potatoes breakfast seems like a great deal, I don't think I'll ever get around to taking advantage of that bargain. Who knows if the waitstaff would notice if I was there?

1 star for the service, .5 for the price of the drinks, .5 for memories of how neat CC used to be back in the day."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for steak so we decided to have some there! The food tastes amazing, however the service was awful. We found a hair in our food and although the manager stop to apologized they never offered replace the meal, he offered some free drinks that we never got and the waitress was MIA...never went back to refilled our drinks and ask if we needed anything else!"}
{"text":"The service really sucked... there was no one there and the waiter still never bothered to check on us. The food was actually pretty good. The Krispy Kreme burger was delicious! But the tacos weren't very good. They also have a meatloaf sandwich that was good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Good food.  Nice atmosphere. 
Service was so bad I had to leave my table to go to bar to get water that I ordered when I sat down.  Wish I spent my evening somewhere else."}
{"text":"No one knows what's going on. One bar tender said groupon could get on the rocks, other bar tender said frozen. Bar tender was more concerned with collecting tax, than making our drinks... I  wasn't going to forget your whole $3. Geesh. Tried the groupon... won't be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Bartender was cool as hell. hooked us up with our drinks, we got the big 4- 44oz margaritas deal they had on groupon. they were strong and got the job done."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if it was an option. I never send food back. I'm a disposal when I comes to eating so I do not have the highest standards to begin with. Had dinner last night. The steak was decent, fries were hard and not edible. Veggies ok flavor but really greasy. Cheesecake was actually good. This morning had a bit of a hangover and needed my go to hangover breakfast of chicken fried steak and eggs. Well they didn't have any due to ordering mix up. So I went with the scrambler of some sort and had to send it back as well as my wife's breakfast which was ham and eggs. Don't waste your time or money at this terrible excuse for a restaurant. The staff seemed as though they get this reaction a lot. I really don't expect much but if your going to charge premium prices even at a resort the food should be at very least good quality. I wouldn't feed this crap to my dogs. Does Vince know how terribly your food is? Probably never set foot in here and I don't blame him. I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this awful food quality. What a shame. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"Disappointing breakfast and terrible service. Asked for eggs cooked sunny side down - were served sunny side up and still with raw white. Breakfast tea came without milk and with a straw in it.
My friend also had the 2-2-2 Special Breakfast and asked for a side of bacon that never arrived. We had to remind the server and it came out when we had finished."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a weekend vacation. Seemed like an interesting place to lunch so we did. From the beginning the manager had a horrible attitude with people waiting to be seated. After waiting about 10 mins, we were seated, we decided on drinks. It literally took 40 MINUTES for 3 drinks. Not even waters were brought to us. We ordered food and waited a another 30 MINUTES I noticed the manager walking around and around and flagged her down and asked if we could just get the check for our drinks and leave. She ignored me and walked away and simple said \"let me check on your order\". 5 minutes later our food was brought to us. Food tasted great don't get me wrong, but the service is the worse I've ever received. The manager had the nerve to walk over and asked how our food was not apologize what so ever until I again complained about how it should not take 50+ minutes for food. She began giving excuses after excuses to why it was taking long and stated to me \"well if you could see we only have one chef back there you would understand\" I DONT CARE !!! it's that kind of attitude and customer service that is disgusting !! I would never return here or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Worst place you can really go out an dine in ...sloppy servers with poor hygienes, took them about 15 min to get our orders just for drinks and another 10 to get them..the place was dead so I don't understand why they made us wait long to be served..even our food came out all cold I wanted to walk I out so bad like a party of 6 did and left there food there...thus place needs more observation in managing there customers service as well as there hygiene.  Never again I'll go back..it's ridiculous to charge 18% for really poor and lousy service.."}
{"text":"Slow, mediocre, gross cocktails...  So unimpressed.  Dirty old and frayed menus with uninspired food.  It's Vegas, what a mistake coming here with so many good places to eat.  Gordon Ramsey Pub in Bellagio is the same price and a league better!"}
{"text":"This place has only recently opened and the staff are still getting on their feet. Came here for breakfast. Music atmosphere is classic rock, so if you're not a fan, then it's maybe not for you, but it's a haven for memorabilia of the era for true fans. The massive flaw with this place is that it's in the dead centre of circus circus, a place I would not recommend to anyone, so it's up to you whether it's worth the walk from neighbouring places like Encore, Wynn, Treasure Island and Palazzo, where good food already exists"}
{"text":"I had a groupon deal for two dinners n a bottle of wine, I substituted the wine for daiquiris. The steak n veggies was really good, fries a bit too greasy. The managers were greats at addressing n fixing any issues u may have with the food. I must admit I think the are under staffed I gave my waitress my order only for another waiter to come and ask me what my order was again annoying."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had the burgers and thought they were great. Our waitress was Windy and she was amazing. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got a great groupon for this place and wasn't expecting much because it was such a good deal. Happy to say I was very satisfied with the food and service. Shannon was fantasic, thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I got the coupon they give you in the lobby, it's a lie the food is a joke. The waiters don't know what they are doing, they got my order wrong. Oh and the gratitude is included in the bill lmao."}
{"text":"The wait staff is lacking. However the food is good and decently priced. Breakfast has two specials that aren't on the menu that are a great deal.... when you check into the hotel they give you a little pass book with all that info. Also two for one yards of alcohol are fun!"}
{"text":"A margarita in clear plastic dickie cup??? Wtf?? The drunkin shrimp plate should of been called the goldfish feeder shrimp platter.."}
{"text":"Groupon brought me in here. I ended up eating alone while my husband was at a bachelor party. I feel weird eating alone, but Jose and bartender Tito were so welcoming and nice. Jose sat with me for a few minutes to chat. Tito let me trade the wine for some cider, since I really don't want a whole bottle of wine to myself. They actually have chefs there who know what a rare steak is, so I was happy with my food. I'm not one who's interested in karaoke, but even I could see how good the KJ was at working the crowd and boosting the confidence for nervous singers. All in all, it was a great experience and I'm glad I still went, even by myself."}
{"text":"awesome place. steak is good and the krispy creme ice cream dessert is the bomb. and you thought is a bar or such but its more famiy oriented since its in circus circus and kids love th sing at the karaoke. love raw talents. be back. its really fun"}
{"text":"I used a Groupon for the steak dinner and got food poisoning, as did my girlfriend. We had both asked for medium rare but mine was like chewing on bubble gum, I only took 2 bites and had to leave the rest. That's all it took to incapacitate me for the next 36 hours, thankfully my girlfriend's was more fully cooked and didn't get it as bad. I don't know if it was because we arrived on a Sunday at 10pm or if they use leftover steaks for groupon users but it is inexcusable. I've never been so sick and based on the symptoms, I think it might have been salmonella. The only saving grace was the talented karaoke singers. I usually never post reviews but felt it was necessary to warn people of the gamble of eating here. I realize not everyone gets food poisoning here but even one time is too many."}
{"text":"Sal the new manager was very complimentary to our large party.. Great man, staff and establishment. We will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Plain nasty.  Rude waitress and who doesn't carry Bacardi?"}
{"text":"Had the 2 for $25 margaritas, they were good. Shared the chips and guacamole, good size guac but didn't seem fresh made. I had pulled pork tacos, good flavor but pork was a tad dry. Husband had the burger with chorizo and he loved it. Decent food, okay service."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else had a coupon/Groupon, but unlike everyone else my expectations were low considering we are choosing to eat at place with 80's glam rocker, womanizer, drunk lead singer of Motley Crue in the restaurant name!!! Us being fans of said rocker/band went anyway. While frozen margaritas were over priced
(But were in Vegas isn't) it went along with the two appetizers we ordered. Nachos and chips with guacamole. Like I previously stated we knew what we were getting into by choosing to eat at Vince Neil's restaurant. Nachos were good, plenty of toppings, came out warm not to much to screw up on nachos. Guacamole tasted like to was squeezed out of a pouch you buy at your local grocery store, add some salt, mix it up, good to go. Wait staff pretty good, could get a little bogged down during peak hours. But, all in all we knew what to expect before we entered. Last footnote, awesome tunes playing while we ate!!!"}
{"text":"We too used a Groupon and were expecting so so service but I'm happy to say that the food was very good and the service was top notch. Our hostess was very nice and brought us some nice iced waters right away (very well appreciated in this heat!). The steaks were delicious....we are visiting from Manhattan and let me tell ya I've paid more money for steaks not as good as these. The fries were crunchy and yummy and veggies were standard. For the wine we chose a Riesling that was great as well...chilled nicely in an ice bucket (we didn't want any wine that was not chilled because of the heat). Overall I have to say that the service alone is very hard to beat and the food followed through. Will return on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Eater BEWARE!!  Food poisoning isn't on the menu but that's what I got! Along with the fried chicken that is on the menu."}
{"text":"Wasn't our first choice to come here but we we in the casino and hungry and we decided to give it a chance. Came around 11:45-12, only about 5-6 tables inside that were sat at this time. Ordered 3 apps that were all good ( Mozz sticks, wings, and spin dip ) then ordered the meals once the apps came. Once the waiter took our order we didn't see him again until he was ready to bring us the check. Our server was Duvall and the service was good in the beginning but I guess its a good thing we didn't need anything for our meals and everything came out alright because the server completely vanished and never checked on us.  Most likely not coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"food decent if you can get service. drinks are watered-down top much sour mix. tried there twice and failed both times"}
{"text":"First time here and I wasn't satisfied. 
the waiter took long to get our drink order, the food took a little longer than I expected,  the Buffalo chicken strip were ok, my in laws burger bun was hard. but what set it over the top was that my gf ordered a side of blue cheese and it was sour. So I told the waiter he said he was sorry and said I'll bring you a new one so he did and to my suprise the second oder of blue cheese was also expired.  Will not be here again."}
{"text":"Average food, above average prices. Service is good and the atmosphere is casino/bar like. 
Would I eat here again? Idk. Chose this place because I was hungry for a burger (15$)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place while in vegas and it took them about 10 minutes to actually seat us because nobody was at the front desk. Another ten to fifteen minutes for them to get our drink and food order. Mind you it was not busy at all. Waited for about a half an hour for our food and when we ordered we asked for ranch. Of course it was not brought to us so we asked again when they brought us our food and again it was not brought to us. Finally my boyfriend had to get up and ask for ranch and refills on our drinks because nobody came buy to see if we needed anything. Their food was okay but the fries were cold and stale. We had to get up and find someone to bring us our bill as well. So all in all it was a terrible experience. Wouldn't recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Great service, quick with our meals and highly reasonable cost! Our server (some bald guy with an arm tattoo, wish I could give him a proper shout out) was great! The 8 oz steak was buttery and the veggies were succulent! Don't listen to these stuck up bitches on yelp giving out 2 stars because everything was \"average\". Too many white people though...."}
{"text":"Service was slow but there was only 1 server on the floor. I was really surprised by the food since service started off so slow. It was really really good!! Karoke was hilarious and added fun to the night!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located inside Circus Circus hotel and is literally the last restaurant along a massive hallway and sort of hidden unless you go around a corner.  We actually only found out about it as we were coming downstairs and someone was handing out flyers for dinner for 2 for $40.00. I'm so glad we took the flyer. Nothing in Las Vegas is free anymore, but we still were looking for a great bargain. If you are too, go here. 


The $40 special was for 2 strip steaks with a veg and a bottle of wine and dessert for 2. Our steaks were prepared perfectly, and our server was really nice. The wine wasn't horrible, and the cheesecake was sooooo good.  They have TV's all around the restaurant, and they offer karaoke on a large stage. The next day, we had jet lag and got a late start. The  Circus Circus hotel has pretty limited choices for food without getting trampled by kids, so we went back to gamble for a few and saw that this restaurant was open for breakfast too. SCORE!!  I had the steak and eggs breakfast for $10 and change and my husband had pancakes for $7. It's not the prettiest of atmospheres for breakfast, but again, the servers were really nice, and you can't beat the price.  

All in all, I was really impressed with the place and  what they had to offer.  They have a full, varied menu, speedy and friendly service.  I would go back in  a heart beat."}
{"text":"great experience, they honored the groupon 4 steaks and 2 bottles of wine on new year's eve december 31, 2015.  selena the waitress was very helpful.  the live show singer they had wasn't that great but the steaks, and wine was way more than i expected.  i haven't that good of a steak in a long time....

GROUPON New York Strip Steak Dinners with Wine for Two or Four at Vince Neil's Tatuado Eat Drink Party (49% Off)"}
{"text":"This was the first of many stops in Vegas for step-daughter's 21st. She wanted to participate in the karaoke, so we decided to start with dinner and drinks there. Hands down, the best damn steak I have ever eaten!! Better than any steakhouse. It literally melted in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I had the Mac n Cheese Burger with fries. The fries were a little on the cold side, but the burger was really good. A bit to cold on the inside of the place for me, but overall I enjoyed my lunch."}
{"text":"I am a strict vegan & I ordered the veggie burrito and it had a piece of chicken in it! Lost my whole appetite. Beyond upset & disgusted."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or time. Food was terrible and over priced. we were only able to eat 1 meal out of 4 and after discounting check, still charged $28. Service was poor because not enough servers."}
{"text":"Some manager called destiny was rude and unprofessional to not only are table but a few others. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a good burger. Fresh ingredients-crispy fries.  Flare bar tenders were fun to watch.  Service was fast, efficient, and friendly! Plan to return."}
{"text":"Food was so-so.  Service was terrible. I ordered iced tea & asked for Splenda but never got it.  I had to go to another table & borrow some from them.  Over-rated all around.  There was a lot of interesting stuff on the walls but food & service were not great!  Also, I bought a tank top there & when I got home I noticed it has a hole in it!  What a waste!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I use groupons quote a bit and generally satisfied until now.  It definitely wasn't the walk from the main strip.  The restaurant is in circus circus which has been there forever and smells like it.  The setting is perfect for families but not couples that want quiet time. Good was horrible."}
{"text":"this place sucks they don't even play any rock they just have old farts doing karaoke to songs from The Wiggles and they don't have toilets full of booze anymore alls they have is \"wacky\" jar drinks filled with grandma juice. there are zero babes. everyone had their shirts on. this is literally the opposite of a Mötley Crüe bar. no drunk people. there were children inside. CHILDREN. the only clue that i was not actually inside of an Applebee's was that there was a bunch of pics of Mötley Crüe on the walls. go literally anywhere else if you wanna rock."}
{"text":"It's like Denny's but worse, it's convenient cause it's in the hotel/casino but definitely profit over putting out a good product"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives: it's a quiet relief from the chaos outside. If you're into 80/90s rock, it does capture that mood. 

The food unfortunately was slightly better than fast food.  Also,  our server was friendly but the food took awhile to arrive.

This place has the potential to be a Rock and Brews - this Gene Simmons pub which is similar but has much better food and vibe."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as I stay at Circus -Circus regularly.  I love all the 80's Rock videos that play and there are the rare occasions Vince Neil is on site (saw him last year, early 2015) (which was pretty bad-ass!).

The food, specifically the entree items, is decent, but their fries are scrawny and gross; couldn't eat them because of them being overcooked, to the point of being chewy.  On the flip side of the clock, breakfast was delish! 

I will return to Tatuado!"}
{"text":"Do not eat the breakfast- bland and cold.  I was hungry so I powered through it, but the tastiest thing was the (plain) sourdough toast, so that's saying something.  (And, by the way, since when is toast just a large single piece of bread? Apparently since I had breakfast here.)  I really regret not getting McDonald's. 

Lunch and dinner is a little better, but still overpriced for the low quality and slow service.  If you find yourself on this end of the Strip, just go to SLS or hop in a cab.  No bueno.  

Really, don't eat the breakfast."}
{"text":"I had high expectations going into this place as it 'appeared' to be a nice spot and had Vince's name attached to it.  Low and behold I'm burned again for not checking Yelp before going into an establishment....  why wont' I learn my lesson?  lol

Food was actually decent on the surface...  service was indeed terrible as other indicated and things seemed to move a snails pace.  We had to go track someone down just to put in our order.

The important part here is that my wife and I both received food poisoning here.  We both had burgers.  She was extremely sick for 2 days and couldn't hardly move...  it was NO JOKE.  I've never seen her that sick from food...  I would definitely not recommend going here for that reason alone.  ITS NOT SAFE PEOPLE!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner, ordered steak and salad. Both was great. Cheesecake for desert was average.
They had karaoke which I am not a fan of, bug did a good job of keeping noise at a level where you are still able to have a conversation with others."}
{"text":"It was my first time in last night and I had the kindest and most enthusiastic server, Marissa. The karaoke was fun and I like that you get up on a proper stage and the whole bar sings along. I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We visited this place twice while in Vegas.  First time for dinner,  it was horrible, the steak was very fatty and grisly.  The service also bad.  We came back the next morning to try the breakfast,  it was just as bad!  The eggs were not cooked as asked, the sausage was just nasty and the service was even worse this morning."}
{"text":"Hubby & I had a steak dinner, which was pretty decent. We ordered our steaks medium & they came out just the way we ordered them. It wasn't a spectacular dinner, but was good."}
{"text":"Better than expected. I had read the reviews on yelp, and did not expect much. I ate here about a month ago with my parents. Food is slightly pricey, but we came here because of comp'ed meal.The place was somewhat empty since we came around 5pm. 

Food is good. Its very typical American food. It's not amazing, but above average. Service is good. The waitress was attentive. Food came fairly quickly and it came out well. 

Bottom line: Come here if you have a comp meal @ circus circus."}
{"text":"45 mins to get basic breakfast! Food was not worth the wait. Overpriced and service was terrible"}
{"text":"We had Groupon for the 2 Steak Dinners and Bottle of wine.

First Impression: Rock themed, kind of a 3 star vibe with a dive a local aspect to it. Brandon our greeter was the rockstar of the place, super personable and attentive.

Steaks were ok but not $ 30.00 a pop good, portion was just right to clean the plate but didn't leave you feeling immobile.

Overall, unless you're staying here its not a place that will compete with some of the other fine dining in Vegas but if you have a family and you're trying to please everyone it could be the spot for you if you're in the neighborhood. Won't blow you away but will satisfy for a night of just hunger.

P.S. Really glad they didn't have karokee, not the intimate place to have a steak, there will be a lot of noise and action going on."}
{"text":"Horrid. Worst pork tacos I have ever had. Out of their tequila. So they offered up patron. Which turned out to be an upsell. Then didn't want to give up the cheap free shot glass. Fave was the fact this place is based on his tequila and vodka brands. My drink was served in a Tito's vodka jar.  From food to marketing just disappointing."}
{"text":"Food: We got the Groupon deal with steak, fries, grilled veggies, a slice of cheesecake, and a bottle of wine. Since we got it for 4 people - they came up to a total one entree per person and 2 cheese cakes and 2 bottles of wine for the table. The steak wasn't bad, but wasn't great. I asked for rare and I got what looked like medium. Whereas my friends who asked for medium looked like they got rare. The fries and veggies are average tasting. The portion sizes are kind of small. The cheesecake was huge and tasted pretty good though! The wine you could choose between red or white - and was just a cheap bottle (probably around $10-$15). Overall, it was a pretty average meal. 

Price: The Groupon was I think around $70 and I got it with a Groupon deal of $5 off food / drink deals, so in the end, it totaled to about $11-12 per person - which you will never find such a cheap steak deal. Ever. For the price, we got the steak, dessert, and wine. So although the food was subpar, the deal was really quite great.

Service: Service was mediocre - nothing special or exceptional. Everyone was relatively friendly. They didn't really waste time talking to us or explaining the menu. When we sat down and told them we had the groupon, they basically just asked how we wanted our steak and what kind of wine we wanted and that was it. The server even brought our meal to the wrong table and then brought it to ours afterwards...

Ambiance: Interesting, there's lots of art and record - playing oldies music. Seats are red and there are lots of booths available. Has a rustic feel to it and some sort of music gimmick that I didn't really understand,"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for early dinner after SuperToyCon show at Circus Circus.  Loved the decor and rock n roll theme, but the service was slow and the food was, meh.  Took a while to get drink orders in.  We ordered the \"monstrosity platter\" of appetizers.  While we waited for the food to come out, we watched the line to get in get longer and longer because there was no hostess up front at the hostess station.  The folks seated next to us still waiting to put there drink orders in.  Our food finally came out.  The food was ok, but just ok.  This \"monstrosity platter\" is definitely not worth its $35.99 price tag.  These were apps that we could have gotten at the snack bar at the amusement park, just much more expensive.  I was still hungry enough to order dessert, which was the Krispy Kreme doughnut sandwich.  Even that took a while to come out.  But when it did, it was delicious and the highlight of the rather tasteless meal.  Still would not come back to eat here though because of the painfully slow service."}
{"text":"Good service. The staff was very nice and ontop of things. The food was great too. We got the loaded fries as an appetizer,  then steak with side of Veggies as entrée.  The steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"To start I wish I was able to give 0 stars! My boyfriend and I wanted to enjoy a nice dinner for my birthday. Since we had a coupon we decided to try this place out. We waited about 5-10 minutes just for a hostess to seat us.  We sat down and waited patiently for a waiter. We waited about 10 + minutes and no one came to our table. Some waiters walked passed our table and didn't even bother to acknowledge us. So we both decided to leave. Another employee that works there even watched us leave and didn't bother to ask or to help us. Service is terrible. We will never go back!!"}
{"text":"The BEST meal in Vegas! Staff was amazing, bartender had a heavy pour and the atmosphere was incredible! We ordered chips/guacamole for an appetizer and the salsa was delicious. For an entree we both ordered the NY Strip - one well and one medium. They both came out well done but the waiter was quick to get it taken care of. 

Will be visiting Circus Circus again just to eat here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the $40 Groupon
Deal for 2 steaks, a bottle of wine & a cheesecake to share. Really good deal. 
The steak was moderate, nothing great but also nothing to complain about.
wine was just a barefoot brand but still good.
The service Brian gave was great! was really inviting, continously had a smile on his face."}
{"text":"The entire staff was very friendly. Brian was an awesome waiter. The food had good flavoring. The cheesecake was very tasty however not large enough for two people. We ordered margaritas as well and they were awful...they were taken back without any fuss. A few cosmetic updates wouldn't be bad. All in all I would go back."}
{"text":"Not too bad. We came here on a whim to find some food to eat for breakfast. We were both caught by the breakfast deal outside the restaurant and decided to give it a try. We ended up not getting the deal and ordered something else lol. It was a good niche to get people in.

I ordered the eggs benedict which came with tater tots. It was good! My Tater tots were crisp and I absolutely love Tater tots!
Service was not too bad, wish our server checked on us more often. My S/O wanted a glass of water and I needed to flag him down for that.

The restaurant is full of Mötley Crüe memorabilia which was interesting to look at. Atmosphere was relaxed and casual. It's a convenient place to eat while staying at Circus Circus!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for drinks, karaoke, and gambling after at Circus Circus. Saw Vince here recently for his birthday party. Great rockin' atmosphere. Always a good time. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Food is adequate at best. They have some good deals and coupons so the price is good for Vegas but you get what you pay for.  The $39 steak dinner for 2 for example was just meh but for the price and it was adequate. You get a bottle of wine included with it but it's a $4 bottle of tisdale which is crap.  Our waiter had a bad attitude and offered us  white or red without asking if we wanted the cab, merlot, Shiraz etc   I guess with wine that cheap they all taste the same anyways but come on. My main complaint was that everything was dirty: water served in a grimy looking glass, wine glasses  were really cloudy, silverware crusty, table sticky."}
{"text":"Crystal, thank you so much for putting together the Razo wedding reception Saturday, Desirae loved the layout in the back area..we had about 30 people showing up at different times and everything went Great!! Thank you again for taking such good care of us All..the food was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, we orders the New York strip dinner and it did not disappoint! The service was prompt and courteous. The atmosphere is inviting and interactive with nightly karaoke. The best part are the cocktail's, they do not lack strength at all!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Its Vegas so the price is to high for the food. Fries & N.Y. Strip both over cooked. Taste good but over cooked!!"}
{"text":"Ok so to start we got a groupon for this place for 2 steaks a bottle of wine and dessert. When we first walked in we were takin in right away but then put at a booth that was absolutely not ready for new guest with left over BBQ sauce and other leftovers on the table. After we sat down it took forever for our server to greet us and then for us to tell the server to clean the table. As we were greeted which was not even a greet more like a what do you want. We told the server which was Brian we have a groupon and without anything else said he asked for the groupon number and left. We did not get asked for drinks nor if we would have liked anything else for tonight seriously it was absolutely the worst customer service experience. On top of that we were switched out with a new server without even knowing with a server named JP. Granted the groupon was worth the price but not worth the time to come down to circus circus to be mistreated with horrible customer service at Vince Neil Tatuado. I will not come back nor recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fun little date night, good steak and veggies, awesome atmosphere! The service was quick and fast."}
{"text":"My family was staying at Circus Circus so we decided to stop in for a quick drink and appetizer.  We were almost ready to leave when someone finally came up to seat us and that was only bc the phone was ringing..   Our waiter was less than thrilled to be there.  We had ordered 2 root beer floats, order of fries (IThey were good), an the apple pie ala mode, a beer and a mixed drink.   There was no ice cream on the pie, and no ice cream in the root beer floats.  They mighta put a tsp of ice cream in there but highly doubt it.  Our tab was about $70 with tip.  Not a place I would recommend"}
{"text":"We came here to get a major dose of 80's rock and some food and drinks. What we got was open mic karaoke with everyone singing Who let the Dogs out and Hotline. The food was okay about the same quality you'd get from your local Dennys or IHOP. bartender was nice, but then he totally forgot about us. We had one round, he never talked to us again. We flagged down a server to pay."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night because my friend was jonesing for karaoke and this place has it 7 nights a week. Located in the Circus Jerkus casino which I would normally avoid but here we were. We Lyfted it over around 8pm or so and the place was pretty hopping. A number of families with little kids were seated near us so I guess you can so it's ok for families. Motley Crue gold records and guitars on the wall so it's like a Hard Rock Cafe centered around Motley Crue. A couple of the items are named after Motley Crue songs - Mac & Cheese Feelgoods Delight and Wild Side BBQ Bacon. I had the Wild Side BBQ Bacon. It was alright. I was starving. They had Lagunitas on draft of which I partook but their beer selection was rather limited. The karaoke host that night was very animated - not sure if I ever saw a host so full of energy. He would put on wigs and rock out with a blow-up guitar standing along the singer whenever they were singing a rock and roll type song. Either that or he would do a dance. Also he would give away prizes and keep the audience engaged with various tricks and audience participation games. The karaoke is done on a big stage and there is a little screen right in the middle where the lyrics get displayed. The microphone is even on a big microphone stand if you ever wanted to play rock star and channel your inner Steven Tyler or Vince Neil and do microphone stand tricks. Food was ok. Karaoke show was a bigger plus in my book. Disappointed that more menu items weren't named after Motley Crue songs. Here's a few suggestions: \"Droppin' Like\" Fries, Shout at the Devil Quesadilla, Smoke the Sky Salmon, Kickstart My Hearty Chili, Grilled, Grilled, Grilled Steak, Hammered Shrimp, Live Wire Burger, Knock 'Em Dead, Dip, Sticky Sweet Creme Brulee. Ok. I'll stop before someone gets violent. Extra point for karaoke good times otherwise the food and our kinda rude waiter would rate just a three. Your mileage, as always, may vary - just don't get caught smokin' in the boys room."}
{"text":"Had to wait quite a bit for the food. I ordered the Rock'N Spaghetti but it did not have much flavor. For the price I paid and for the time i waited it could have been better."}
{"text":"I have to say I was not expecting much when I read the reviews for this place.  I bought the groupon because I love Motley Crue and wanted to see what it was all about..  Can I just tell you we had the best experience here, I brought myself, my husband, our two kids and my parents and our food was awesome and the waitress was one of the best we have had in this trip to Vegas!!! Elisabeth was our waitress, you must ask to sit in her section she is beyond fabulous!! She made the meal extra special!!! Great food and great service!!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Omg forget carnival bar. Look for victor and sebastian!! The flare techniques are amazing. I don't usually rate bars but I really think they're not getting enough credit for what they're doing. Find them at circus circus!! I know circus... Really? But they're really worth visiting!!"}
{"text":"Good food, so-so service. They tried to sneak in a 20% automatic gratuity on our party of 8. Our group was 4 adults, 4 children aged 11, 10, 8 and 3 1/2. They shouldn't be able to include children in this \"automatic gratuity\" count.

The meatloaf sandwich was good though."}
{"text":"We went here because 1. We were staying at circus circus and 2. We had a coupon. Saying that, we had a 5 minute wait for breakfast and the two of us and then got seated by a nice hostess. It took us at least 5 minutes to order drinks and then another 10 minutes to get them. My drink was not up to expectations and I made my boyfriend drink it because I couldnt. The food was average, reminded me of something you would get from a mom and pop breakfast. Might go back again just for food (if we had a coupon). Skip the Drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing show, great food and the best bartenders in Vegas. I love coming to this bar because they really take care of their customers and provide great entertainment for free!!

If you're in Vegas, definitely stop by here and watch the flare show, James Michael, or just have a great bite to eat!"}
{"text":"First off, the customer service here is fairly good. We were assisted as soon as we sat down, which was nice. The waitress took our order quickly and went to get our drinks quickly as well. But the food on the other hand, took like an hour before it finally came out to the table. I had ordered a medium well steak but I got a fairly rare steak. my boyfriend had ordered a medium rare steak and his steak came out to be well done, it was really tough and dry. The burger my brother in law had ordered was not what was described in the menu. Honestly you could get a better burger else where, like In-N-Out. the food is SO NOT worth the price. In my opinion, I feel like the quality and taste of the food is less than mediocre. Not to mention I have asthma and the smoke from the cigarettes that people smoke in the casino is so overwhelming and you can still smell it strongly in the restaurant. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone and I would not come back here again. The food is gross, it is expensive, it smells, and you can get better food elsewhere. You're better off at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Don't waste a dime or your time. Worst customer experience on the strip. First food was cold. Average tasting and not busy when manager notified not one of the two came to our table until I insisted. One manager allowed a man in the dinning room in bathing suit and no shirt. The person proceeded to put shorts and shirt on in the dinning room. This manager could have cared less. His answer was why not? Vince Neil should be ashamed to have his name attached to it."}
{"text":"Horrible service went to dine in with my family got a table real quick wasn't to busy a lot of open tables. I was waiting for about 20mins and still no service provide a family that went in waited for about 10mins and left. We also decided to leave and as we were leaving a waiter finally decided to approach us and asked to take our order after 20mins I wasn't having it so I kindly told her no thank you and left. Will never eat here when I visit vegas again"}
{"text":"Yay Kick Start My Heart!! Ok Good place have Drinks seems the Front Bar Area is a local Hangout etc. Good Fun people etc. Hung out here Two nights and Had Fun! Never Had food but one night we tried and The food shut down Early lol 24/7 Ha!"}
{"text":"The host I forgot her name I think it's Lindor or something like a truffle or chocolate lol. She told me but I forget her name she is very nice and the manager Juan is also very nice. The food is good I got wings. They gave me extra sauce. The only thing I wish the wings came with carrots and celery sticks."}
{"text":"So much better than the last time. The Food was good and our bartender was awesome!!  I recommend the monstrosity appetizer."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Karaoke in town!  I travel the country for work and do karaoke in Atlanta, New York, Vegas, my home town of Seattle, and more...  this is definitely the place I look forward to most.  I recently brought my whole family to Vegas and our children got to have their karaoke debut at Vince Neils.  
Dennis D'Satchmo was the Karaoke DJ for the night and was amazing.  He is the nicest and most talented host.  He was very polite to my family and even played the trumpet during my song! (What a wonderful world by Louis Armstrong).  
During our stay in Vegas we did a helicopter ride, Marvel Avengers Station, and more....but karaoke was our boys' favorite part of the entire trip!
Also, we had a Groupon for steaks and wine which was a hell of a deal!  

Thank you for the awesome time!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Place was very cool - kick ass videos playing. Very crowded - good food -
We stuck around to see show- 
Our server was very good 
Bartender needs to shake up the cocktails if asked to be shaken. - only flaw I could see. 
Would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and the Mac n Cheese Burger. They were both delicious. Karaoke a little boring but the food is worth the bad singers."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever had. Nachos tasted like they were made with canned kidney beans and it was lukewarm when it arrived to the table. 
I ordered a pina colada and it has to be the worst thing I ever drank. It had a very artificial taste and came out watery, not slushy. 
Extremely long wait to receive food and pay bill even though it wasn't crowded."}
{"text":"Passed by the place for an early dinner and stopped because we were too tired to venture out to anywhere else. I'm not a Motley Crew fan so the theme didn't do anything for me so my review is strictly service and food based. The service was slow, we had to wait for a hostess, wait for water and wait for food and refills. The food was okay and the prices were slightly high for the quality. Might be worth trying if you're a Crew fan but I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here because of the food."}
{"text":"Good prices. The food is very middle of the road. Can't beat the 7.99 steak and eggs. Unless your the type of guy that is willing to pay 6 more dollars for better steak and eggs...... We went there three days in a row. I don't recommend this unless your a wild 80's woman desperate to relive that one night you went on Poison's bus."}
{"text":"I had the black and bleu burger it was very good especially the aolli sauce they put in it made it over the top !! Friendly customer service and the prices were decent"}
{"text":"Our breakfast experience was horrendous at Circus Circus hotel restaurant Vince Neil's. We felt unwelcomed the first moment they \"ignored\" us. They made a prejudice comment on how we are too young to drink coffee, and expedited the process to get us out of there. We just needed a nice place to have breakfast before we start our work day. I don't recommend young professionals to go here unless you want to be treated like shit."}
{"text":"Service was good. Brandon was nice and attentive. Food was not so good. Eggs are HORRIBLE. We ordered scrambled and they were cooked but were soooooo watery. Home fries were seasoned cut up steak fries. I can say my toast was good after getting a new one.  First one was stale looking and old. Was not impressed and will never go back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! So my partner and I decided to try out this restaurant and all I can say is we both were disappointed. The food was really bland and the service was awful. I order the doughnut burger and it lacked creativity, presentation and most importantly flavor. The burger patty was  a frozen patty that was made in a factory. Everything about the food was just off. Our waiter came a few times and wasn't showing the customer service that should be given. He wasn't rude he was just blah, like he was miserable. The icing on the cake was it was karaoke night. If I would of known I would of sat somewhere away from the stage. The guy and girl running the equipment had some issues resulting in loud noises that startled everyone in the restaurant. It made it hard to have any type of conversation with anyone."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem out here in the boondocks. We were driving from Vegas to Death Valley and I wanted to stop and get lunch, food items, water, and gas before heading out to no mans land. A quick look at Yelp and this place came out of nowhere, what a find. Anyone who is a fan of heavy metal music and is in Pahrump must make a pilgrimage to Vince's place. They have live music on Fridays and Saturdays, and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"The shrimp taco is to-die-for.  Spicy with a hint of cilantro and the crunch of cabbage and good sized prawns."}
{"text":"I was pretty thrilled that I got a coupon to come here and I thought why not? I like the guy and I can see a circus act/drink/play/gamble/ and eat all at once..YAY! So the deal was a bottle of wine with two 8oz steaks for $29!! Yes you heard me right twenty-nine dollas that make you wanna halla! 
Most restaurants inside the casino/hotels tend to be a little over-priced especially hen it comes to steak and a bottle of wine.
I ordered mine medium well and it came with veggies and french fries and as our wine we selected white wine (we wanted something sweeter). Our steaks arrived and couldn't help to notice the charcoal taste! I said medium well not burnt. However I was very hungry and we had stayed pretty late the night before I did not have the server replace my steak and just dealt with it. Over all from this experience I thought what you buy is what you get, the wine and steak were not all that great but then again I should've figured with that low price. Luckily the service was great and did not feel \"too\" bad coming here all thanks to the service."}
{"text":"9 visits to Las Vegas and I never stepped foot in the historic Circus Circus...the only reason I even wanted to visit this time around was to check this place out.  I'm not exactly the biggest Vince Neil fan, but I'm a fan of all things Motley Crue :)

Poor planning on my part...I really wanted to check this place out for a meal, however I didn't make it down to Circus Circus till later in the evening but I was able to check this place out for a drink on a Monday night.  There was karaoke going on so we sat at the bar.  This place wasn't booming, but it wasn't dead either... the atmosphere was pretty chill, actually and I wouldn't have mind staying longer if I wasn't exhausted from my third night in Vegas if you know what I mean...

This place is way better than Vince Neil's place that either still is or was in the LV Hilton...it's pretty cool and if you're a Motley Crue Fan, you'd love it even more!!! Seriously...best and probably only Motley Crue themed bar!!!  

I'm not a fan of karaoke, but it was actually pretty entertaining...the woman running it had a lot of energy and kept it entertaining.  Of all the places in Circus Circus, this place is definitely worth checking out and hanging out for a few drinks and maybe even a meal."}
{"text":"We had got the Groupon for the steak dinner with wine. It was our last night in Vegas and i was coming down with the flu, but i managed to peel myself out of my nice cozy bed to come here. Our server was very nice but found the food to be pretty bad. Both of our steaks were full of meat glue/ gristle, lol neither of us finished. The wine was nasty old tisdale two buck chuck at 7-11. The side of veggies and cheesecake were good tho. This place had a cool rocker atmosphere and i would not mind trying a burger instead if we ever make it back."}
{"text":"Beyond terrible service, completely inept management and bartenders.  They do not have wine list."}
{"text":"We didn't eat here; we just had drinks and sang karaoke. I enjoyed it a lot. The KJ really made it fun for the singers and audience.  He kept things moving, too. I enjoyed singing there. I even got my husband to sing, which is rare.  My only complaint is that it's very loud. Karaoke doesn't have to be so loud that you can't talk to the people sitting at the table right next to you.  Anyway, they have a nice song selection and it's great that they let kids sing as well."}
{"text":"Promotional signs throughout Circus Circus advertise a $7.77 breakfast and $10.99 Steak and Egg Dinner.  Upon arriving, I waited 15 minutes to be greeted.   The untimely waitress greeted me with a careless welcome and informed me that specials are only served during specific hours though those hours are not specified in print."}
{"text":"thinking back, those long
Summer days
Young and not afraid
Did what we wanted to
Broke some hearts, didn´t
Think i´d ever start
To get tired of the part
That´s when I pictured you

well it was easy to tell that 
he didn't know me too! 

I spent my time eating and

Great food Mane."}
{"text":"I only came here because i boyfriend wanted to eat hear he also liked the karoake environment. I read the reviews on here before we ate i should of listened and walked away but no.. We stayed ate drank all for 110 for 2 people and i was the worst food ive ever encountered. The shrimp plate we ordered to slay the boneless wings werent good. My piña colada drink was too sweet made me sick came back to my room to throw it all up. I woulnt recommend it. Sorry"}
{"text":"Had the steak and egg breakfast which was good, we'll cooked. My only complaint is lack of timely service during a slow time and it took about 10 minutes to be seen and seated then another 15 to get my water and draft beer."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. We came to enjoy my fiancé's birthday dinner here in hopes for great steak. The meal was very yummy but the service was absolute garbage. It initially took more than 10 minutes to even be greeted by our server. We immediately put our order in the first time seeing him And it took an hour and 45 minutes to get our check. 5 tables that were sat after us, finished and left before we even got our check. We sat for 45 minutes waiting for any service by ANY employee. On top of that the hostess left people standing next to our table for multiple minutes which completely made our atmosphere uncomfortable. Then to top it off the manager did NOTHING to resolve our complaints. I am someone who has served and bartended in the restaurant industry for 6 years. This restaurants customer service is absolute garbage and I do not recommend it at all. They are only worried about the money not the service or satisfaction of their customers. They stick you in the corner and treat you like it, but we weren't even in the corner and still were completely ignored, that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"Used groupon & was able to exchange wine for preferred drinks, our waitress Rita was GREAT!!!  FUN place!!"}
{"text":"Ryan is the best bartender there if you want a great bartender go when Ryan is working I've been to other places but he by far makes you feel welcome and he'll entertain you love ya Ryan you're the best"}
{"text":"I'll start with giving credit of good food and it was delivered fast. The restaurant is sports bar and it was out of beer. No manager presence near the restaurant nor the floor. The restaurant was not busy at all and one waitress was handling over 10 tables. 

PS all I wanted to do is eat,drink, and party! Think twice before coming.

Last thing, look at your receipt twice."}
{"text":"Yes yes yessssssssssss!!!!! I found a Groupon in preparation of our week free of kids trip! We had the best time at this restaurant. There was karaoke and entertainment from the guy on stage. The wine was fantastic. We drank the whole bottle. The steak was perfect, cheesecake amazing and our waiter was fun! My profile picture is us at Vince Neil's. Loved it so much we bought it. Best $10 I spent IMO.  

So why a 4 instead of 5? We got stuck behind the hostess area. You can't see much. While there was a few tables at the stage. Could have seen and been in the mix more."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this restaurant 1 star is because I have to in order to rate it. I went there with my son (who is 7 and luckily ordered a hamburger - can't really screw that up too badly) and my sister. We were waiting for our server for quite a while when some waitress was walking by - I asked, \"are you our waitress?\", and she said, \"sure, I guess\" - no introduction - no personality, no nothin'! We ordered our food - and 20 minutes later another waitress brought our food. Mind you, we still hadn't gotten any drinks we ordered. I can understand that picking up 1 water and 1 soda can be quite difficult - so someone else had to bring our drinks. The steak I ordered was disgusting- tough and full of fat. I tried to get our waitress but she was very rude. Finally I asked for the manager, who came about 10 minutes later. We talked to him about the food and the service. He apologized and said he would try to fix it. So he brought our check and said he was going to take off a whole 6.99!!! Woo hoo! Are you kidding?!?! I told him I thought he should comp my whole dinner, not the price of something I didn't order, but he wouldn't do it. So then I had to pay the waitress that was completely useless through the rest of the evening. So I give my card and she comes back after running it and says, \"here!\" ... And threw my receipt and card on the table! I have never been treated so rudely in my life! And I am a New Yorker so that says something! Do not ever eat there! They just suck!"}
{"text":"Okk soo like many others ,we were skeptical about the Groupon deal that sold the two steak dinners... OMG the one SALAD was huge good for 4 soo no need to order any extra ,the steaks were 8oz thick ,very juicy n super seasoned ,the bottles of wine are Barefoot brand ,soo average quality but u can't beat it.... Here is a tip download ebates or ibotta do both n book your Groupons .... earn n extra 5 to a10 % cash back .. our steak dinner came to 26.40 .... after my cash back ... ENJOY well worth it ... staff n super cool n very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Seating was quick about 5min. I order the  Rock n' Roll King's Breakfast  8 slices of french toast, battered in Rumchata Liqueur. And a bowl of chili yes that's sounds fucken interesting right? I love RumChata I first discovered it in the mid west 3 years ago before it came to the west coast. It taste like thick sweet cinnamon toast crunch milk. I never thought to batter anything with it. This is what made me order this late night breakfast style dish for morning breakfast. So first the chili was great very hearty and not too beanee the bell peppers gave it a Mexican flavor like that Pato sauce my mom uses. In a way it taste like what my dad calls a revuelto (a mix of what ever cans he finds of vegetables and ground beef.) all that was missing was the old green beans to make it take like my dad experiments. It taste very home made and I really enjoyed it. My wife too she ate some of it. ( psa ladies: please order your own food) and now for the RUMCHATA French toast: well, I can't really taste the RumChata, I am not even sure if it's just a sales pitch or gimmick cuz I really don't taste shit!!! It's just half dry French toast. That's all nothing special. The buffet at circus circus has better shit than this dry bread. I feel like they other great things on the menus that I could of had and I wasted it in a 16.99 plate of dry French toast. My wife got the chorizo which was delicious I feel I like I just got tatuado with something I didn't like and now I have to live with it for ever."}
{"text":"Went out with friends and ordered the monstrous platter. There were six of us and couldn't finish it. Standard appetizer fare with wings, artichoke dip, ribs, cheese sticks, chicken strips and nachos. I personally ordered the ribeye steak. It was cooked to the correct temperature and flavorful. Service was a bit slow but otherwise acceptable. I would come back."}
{"text":"It was ok. Expensive compared I other places. Average Food &  took a long time at the bar."}
{"text":"Came back to this restaurant for dinner because we had great food and amazing service during breakfast. I don't remember the person who served us for breakfast but I'm assuming he was the day manager as he was not in the shirts the servers wear. The cheesecake was amazing. Came back for dinner for the $39 special and was given the run around about what we could substitute since we called earlier. Service was close to non-existent. The piece of cheesecake included in the meal was burnt, deliberately picked by our server. 

Do not come here for dinner!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend, her daughter and I went for dinner. It was really good. They split a rack of ribs which were prepared with a nice sauce and fell off the bone. I had jambalaya. All the ingredients were plentiful and I wish they had taken it way earlier because I kept going back at it even though I was full. 
We went back for breakfast and/or lunch, with my gf's daughters boyfriend, sadly it wasn't as satisfying. The waitress, Tami, was inattentive and I felt we needed to ask for things more than twice and we were an inconvenience for her.
My chicken fried steak was a large portion but basically flavorless. 
It's definitely sad and hard to give this place just 3 stars because I'm a fan of the rock and roll theme but one of the only things that would have saved the breakfast was Vince Neil showing up himself."}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for our vacation,  so this was a groupon purchase. 2 steak dinners,  a bottle of wine, and a slice of cheesecake.  What a deal! I didn't like having to get fries with a steak dinner though? A baked potato or mashed potatoes would've gotten this place 10 stars..lol....  We also purchased the 2 44oz. Margarita's on groupon as well.  The drinks and service were excellent.  The server was friendly and the hostess was a real gem! They had karaoke that started at 8pm & the manager even came to our table to greet us! We were even able to take our wine and the test of our Margarita's back to our hotel. How cool is that? I definitely would go back and I highly recommend getting the 44oz. Margarita's if you don't drink wine like us ;) We happily found someone to gift our bottle of wine to!"}
{"text":"Giving it two stars because the food was decent, otherwise I give it one star.  No management around and server was not friendly.  They hardly had beer and our receipt was wrong. We were told to pay with cash because system was down but then changed their mind. Never going back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience EVER!

When we arrived the hostess mentioned that we had just \"missed the dinner rush\" (thank goodness for that!). 10 minutes after the hostess seated us, I had to ask the hostess to send over a server. When the server arrived she had mentioned that another server had \"gone on break without telling anyone\". When my (mis)stake arrived it had 3 different levels of cooked, from end to end: rare, medium rare (which is what I had asked for) and medium. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when I saw on the menu that it would be \"severed\", not \"served\" to me...

Then the \"entertainment\" began... Karaoke???!!! The first song (performed by the guy hired by the restaurant!) was NOT a Motley Crue song, but THE THEME SONG TO GILLIGANS ISLAND!!! Really??? The next song? \"You're gonna miss me when I'm gone\". Then he had his daughter sing a song from the musical \"Grease\"!!! Then he dressed up as a hot dog, but I had stopped listening at that point... After not seeing our server for about 15 minutes, we had to ask for our check, though I doubt anyone would have noticed if we had just walked out."}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of this restaurant. The service was ok, but the food was horrible. We had some loaded fries and nachos. The loaded fries were ok, but the nachos barely had anything on them. My husband had a burger and I had the fried chicken special. The fried chicken was way over cooked and very chewy. The restaurant seemed a little dirty and dingy. Not what I was expecting at all."}
{"text":"Not sure why the 2.5 star review for this place...we came and loved the food and drinks.  Service by Shannon was exceptional as well!  Overall experience was 5 stars all day long!  I recommend for sure!!!  Definitely ask for Shannon.  She's as cool and attentive as can be!!!"}
{"text":"We were BIG fans of the old Vince Neil Tatuado (Cantina) in the LVH/Westgate (We even brought home bottles of his vodka from the place) but it closed in 2014.    So we went to this new place expecting the same chill bar vibe.
SOOOOOOO not the old place.
This is in the casino from hell, Circus Circus - hey, if you like thousands of children running loose, have at this place, otherwise steer clear.
Walked in to a gigantic family restaurant.    We thought we were at the wrong place.
Vince Neil is not exactly what we call family friendly and that's one of the charms of the old place - it had amazing drinks and snacks, an excellent happy hour and NO CHILDREN.....and although we were hoping for the best, we walked into a huge, boring family restaurant with children everywhere.   The place is called Eat, Drink, Party.    Hard to do with crying 3 year olds and tired mothers in flipflops.
We couldn't do it.   We wanted to, but we just couldn't.   We walked out.

Sad.   We're still mourning the old Tatuado."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here several times a week to eat, drink, party and sing karaoke. The managers John and Jose are great and the staff are attentive and fast. Food is good but to some it might seem a  \"little\" pricey but pricing is standard and to be expected of any place on the Las Vegas strip so hotel guests need to take advantage of any deals/specials.  The sound system is awesome. The amount of Vince Neil memorabilia is amazing and he is at the restaurant on occasion like his birthday this past February."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. 16.00 for a Mac and cheese burger. You get about 8 fries and the burger comes out with no veggies. No mayo. Dry and very little Mac and cheese on it."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon for two steaks and a bottle of wine. We also ordered buffalo wings which were great and creme Brule which was just good, but cold. The steaks were good quality which is important to me, but they weren't very flavorful at all. Sides were sub par and cold. It was and okay experience overall."}
{"text":"I'm just lost about this place! Unless you're dining in you have to order from the bar upstairs?

I've kept hoping this place would make improvements to the menu, not so much as of yet. 

As a former GM in the industry customer experience should be paramount for repeat business. 

There is a entire population of potential customers not being served because there is no accommodation for people with dietary needs such as sugar, or salt restrictions. The food is generally over salted on nearly every item due to marinades, but the excess occurs in the kitchen. Taste the food prior to service!!!!

I have no idea how involved ownership is, but much more is necessary. 

My last order was ridiculously over salted, and fortunately the Manager on duty today made things right. 

There's so much I could say but I don't have that kind of time when I'm trying to enjoy a few days of R & R. 

Come on Vince Neil and Tatuado's, step your game up!"}
{"text":"Place has a cool vibe, like the atmosphere but bartender and staff are terrible. Bartender was terrible she unable to take our party of six, drink and food orders at the same time which caused everyone's drinks and meals to come out at different times. She seemed super flustered but was amusing to watch. It wasn't busy considering there was only 10 people total at the bar and she even had a bar back helping her. 
It got really annoying to ask for every little thing like sugar for tea, butter for pancakes, napkins, silverware, missing food and cold food the list goes on and on. For some reason our bill came incorrect, then when the manager came to fix it she said next time if we want the special we need to ask for it specifically and that she would fix it this time. I said look down at the flyer in front of you that's what I handed your bartender. She said oh I'll talk to my staff then. Then I told her all of our problems with the staff and she asked us to write everything we just told her on the back of our receipt. I looked at her like she was an idiot. I'm on vacation I'm not here to write reviews of your staff. I told you the problem now you need to fix it. She told us she would discount our meals 20%, I just laughed. 
Place gets 1 star because the steak and eggs were actually pretty good but pancakes were awful along with the staff."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten in my life. 

I was there with a party of 3 so we decided to get the \"Monstrosity Platter\" which is an appetizer plate that serves 6-8, perfect. Let me tell you, it was definitely a monstrosity. I have no idea how you mess up basic bar food apps but everything on that platter tasted like it was out of a bag and nuked. In fact, my friend even made the comment \"Why do I smell plastic?\" the minute it arrived on the table. 

The spinach artichoke dip was like paste and had a skin after two minutes as if it had been sitting out overnight, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, my friend who was brave enough to try the ribs took one bite and was disgusted. The quesadilla was fine, the mozzarella sticks were average..Burger King has better ones.  

This place serves drinks in souvenir toilet bowls. Now I get why. 2 of the 3 of us were sick all night from this platter. The one that wasn't? That's because she threw up in the restaurant bathroom after 3 bites and had no more. 

Vince Neil should be ashamed his name is attached to this place, he's clearly never tried even the food."}
{"text":"This place exceed my expectation, from environment, service, to food. If you staying in Circus Circus, this place is very nice to take cares of your dines. If you are here for breakfast, then don't miss out on the \"steak and eggs\". Very economical on beer price too (compare to the rest of Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had the avocado burger, it was well cooked and had lots of avocado. I really enjoyed my meal. The environment was relaxing and welcoming and loved all the records and pictures on the wall. The waitress Thianna was kind and the service was fast. I loved it here, definitely coming back when I'm in town again :)"}
{"text":"A nice place to hang out for a while alone or with a group of friends or even with the family. They do have a kids menu. The food was good and drinks were average. The bartender I had was a nice guy and genuinely made an effort to engage his customers. The drinks were a little light handed though. Overall, I would bring my friends here for night out.
I just wish that Vince would go back to Tres Rios tequila instead of the Tatuado."}
{"text":"Great a atmosphere, very fun and lively place to hangout, they also have karaoke.  Average food for a fair price by Vegas standards, the service on the other hand is lacking. I've been twice and the same thing both times getting your waiter to attend to your requests is near impossible and if you want your order correct forget about it!  So my recommendation if your looking for good drinks and great atmosphere, sit at the bar and order drinks and enjoy the karaoke."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere. It's family friendly, and budget friendly considering all the options are town we've seen. Relaxed and casual. 

We ordered the 8 oz steak for two with a bottle of wine for $29.00, (coupon from book from Circus Circus hotel,) Jambalaya, and kids grilled cheese. 

My son had a premium grilled cheese, husband said it was delicious. My oldest son had the Jambalaya, and aside from the sausage quality, was very tasty!!! It is a bit spicy, and I love spicy, so be warned. 

The Steaks were delicious, and the only drawback was fries instead of mashed potatoes or another starch. The veggies are definitely crunchy, just as described. 

Overall, I loved the quality of food, plus the service."}
{"text":"Service was so-so nothing great but not terrible. The place could use some fixing up for example the big screen tv where the videos are playing was working well but you have to remember it is in circus circus and that place is run down. The music was totally 80s but not the hair band 80 but more Michael Jackson u2 pop type.   Drinks were not good I had a margaretta and it was super sweet like lemonade. The food made up for the bad drinks. I had a mushroom burger and it totally rocked way good full of toppings. My daughter had the Mac and cheese burger and it was so unique. This place was a good stop for a filling lunch."}
{"text":"Came here because the rest of the places here sounded awful. Had the chicken avocado sandwich, was ok. Waiter suggested meatball appetizer...they were awful. When the waiter brings the bill, we let him know and he tells me he'd take care of it. Hand over my credit card and he charges me for them anyway. I realize I'm at Circus Circus, but come on dude."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars but I'm not a fan of karaoke as they have karaoke every single night.    I mean come on man.     It would be nice if it was I another hotel also , circus circus is literally like a circus...full of kids and weird people walking around 
However , the food was good and it was cool to see and hear the rock videos as you eat and also there's tons of memoribilia to look at..."}
{"text":"Came for a late breakfast on a Monday morning. Not busy, but took almost 20 minutes just to get my coffee. Waitress was nice but never checked on us, never refilled water. We had to go to hostess station to ask for a box and our check.  Food was just ok, overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant! Casual atmosphere with a few private areas for couples. We had gotten a groupon for two steak dinners, wine and cheesecake. Just enough and the service was great!  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night, party of 4, place had plenty k seating and took 30 minutes to get seated.
First off it took 15 minutes to get out drink order, by that time we placed our order as well. Took another 20 for apps to come out STAY AWAY FROM THE GUACAMOLE. I'm born and raised Cali girl and let me tell you we perfected guacamole. This one had no cilantro, onion, salt, Chile Serrano and my boyfriend who is from Michochan, Mexico would not eat ot after sampling it. Fast forward to out steal which was gteat, seasoned to perfection, cooked eight and the veggies weren't bad. Have to be a genius to fuck that up. Overpriced and slow. Only came because I had a coupon and will not be back"}
{"text":"3/9/16
After trying to figure out a food place we decided on Vince Neil's place. The moment you walk up to the restaurant you met with a barrage of rocker decor and ambiance- very cool!

We were seated very quickly. You can't help but notice the pictures of Vince all over the restaurant, along with music videos that don't go pass the 2000's. 

We ordered our food I got the fajita turkey burger, and it was delicious. The food here is pretty damned good; I'll have to back and try other things."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit this restaurant as I am a huge Motley Crue fan. The decor is amazing, love all of the photos, Vince's outfits, and records. 
The food was great. I had the mushroom burger and a cocktail. Both my friend and I thought the food and drinks were excellent. (But, why only a tiny amount of fries???)
Food is fairly priced for a burger place in Vegas. 

The one complaint I have was the staff. The whole trip up until this point, everywhere we went everyone was super friendly and personable, except this place. We had to wait to be seated and there was no hostess in sight, we were told someone would be with us soon after being seated and a gentleman stepped in to take our order since our waitress was behind. He was nice. He did mention we had to wait for our bar drinks for \"when the bartender gets back\"... he seemed almost confused as to where the bartender went. But overall, we didn't wait too long for our drinks. 

Our actual waitress, she basically talked to us in passing without stopping, never even got her name and it took her forever to run our payment and bring back our card. No smile, no thank you, no nothing from her. She either seemed like she was overworked with too many tables or was perhaps new to her job? Overwhelmed I guess. 

As we were walking out, walked right past a woman at the hostess station, she completely ignored us. A \"have a good night\" or \"thank you\" would have been a much better way to treat your customers with customer service. 
For the most part the food makes up for crappy service. I'd hate to see how the staff handles a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is loud, dirty, smoky, dirty and disgusting. Had a group on that showed a nice restaurant with two steaks and a bottle of wine - this is not what the place looks like at all. I decided to try it any. 
Went in and asked the person seating is if we could sit away from the stage because it was so loud and he said it's going to be just as loud there. Then proceeded to sit us a few tables back from the stage. Then he came back, tossed the menu on the table and walked away.
After waiting twenty minutes without being acknowledged - no water, no one bothering to take an order, I got up and left.

Worst experience of my Las Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I always stay at Circus Circus when I come to Vegas and this place is a huge reason why. Great food, my main recomdations are: Mac And Cheese Burger, EGG Your Burger, and the Loaded Fries. Very well priced, bar prices are about average but the staff is what keeps me coming back. On my most recent trip. I have to give a shout out to Tito and Lauren. 2 phenomenal individuals, great customer service. Really helped me have a great time while I was there. Went there all 4 nights on my trip and they were a huge reason why. 2 fun individuals who really know how to make guests feel great."}
{"text":"We came in because we wanted something to munch on and we saw they had karaoke. We ordered nachos and a side of fries. It's was cool because we got to sing karaoke but the nachos were ok not enough chips or cheese for the price they should be hooked up. My husband said that Dennis nachos are 10 times better. They brought out steak fries (not my fav, they should mention that they are steak fries because they didn't) They were super greasy and not fresh. I was too tired to make a big deal plus my kid and I wanted to sing karaoke. Oh our waiter was not the friendliest."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Steak & eggs was rockin. Chicken fried steak & eggs was fresh & still crispy. Coffee was delicious. Our service was good. The prices were right. Also snuck in for a little bit last night. There's karaoke & it seemed like a really good time based on crowd response. I wouldn't drive to Circus Circus just to eat here but if I stay here next time I will def visit Tatuado again."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and i didnt pay much. I bought a groupon...on sale. The food was mediocre. Jorge never asked how our drinks, food or wine were. None were good. But In fact jorge never even introduced himself.  
Was there a manager there? If so he wasn't touching tables. 
The wine list was laughable. 
We could hardly wait to finish and leave. We are locals and We won't be back."}
{"text":"For starters, all of their seat cushions are extremely worn out to the point that they were uncomfortable and felt like I was tilted and falling the whole time. 

Their water tasted like I was drinking sand. Super gritty and just disgusting. I had to order a bottle of water!! Which is listed for $2.50 on their menu but we were charged $3.50, we saw on the bill.

Our waitress, Elizabeth, gave us our menus and got us our waters. Then she disappeared for awhile and a different waitress, w/ black hair pulled into a tight ponytail, came and took our orders and told us she'd be helping Elizabeth with our table. 

We ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip for our appetizer. It took awhile to come out and wasn't that awesome. It had way huge artichoke hearts and barely any to dip!

I ordered the Wild Side BBQ bacon burger and my boyfriend ordered the Ulcerator burger. It came out like right, right after our appetizer. Annoying.

I asked for my Wild Side BBQ bacon burger with no cheese. And it came out with absolutely nothing on it???  Just a plain burger... not even BBQ sauce or bacon... just plain!! The food runner just dropped our food off and walked away so I didn't even have time to tell him that it was wrong. We waited around looking for at least one of our waitresses and we couldn't find her. A nice lady sitting at a table next to us asked me what was wrong and I told her and she even tried to help us flag down a waitress. Finally, a hostess or something went to get Elizabeth. I told Elizabeth that it wasn't what I had ordered. I told her I wanted the Wild Side BBQ burger w/ everything else just no cheese! She took my burger, that had just been sitting on my table, untouched, as I waited around for someone I could inform about the mistake. 

She came back out in literally 2 seconds with some old and stale bacon, a mess of old onion strings, cold BBQ sauce, and said \"for some reason they thought you wanted nothing on the burger\" ... now why in the world would I order the Wild Side BBQ burger if I wanted nothing on it??? 

I took a few bites, I already knew I hated it on the first bite but I wanted to eat, I was so hungry. After the 3rd bite I had to put it down. It tasted like I was eating a cube of ice. Everything was so hard and cold... 

Again... Elizabeth was nowhere to be found. A busser noticed we were unhappy and he asked me what was wrong. I told him and he went to grab our waitress with the black ponytail. She came back and was super apologetic, she asked if I wanted something else but I just wanted my money back because I didn't want to wait for another shitty meal from here. After she took my plate away, Elizabeth comes by and asks \"so the burger still wasn't what you wanted?\" & I tell her \"it's what I wanted, it was just really nasty\" & she rolled her eyes, shrugged her shoulders, and just WALKED AWAY! Wow, right? No apologies, nothing. 

We RARELY ever complain or ask for refunds but this time, I HAD to. 

The manager also came and asked if we'd like to replace our entree or remove it from the bill. I told him remove it from the bill.

My boyfriend's Ulcerator burger came out correctly the first time. But, they were super skimpy on fries, less than 10 fries came on the plate!! I personally didn't like this burger either, it looked and sounded like it should have been packed with flavor but it just wasn't. It just tasted like ham and dry meat. 

At least they refunded me. I'm really glad the girl with the black ponytail was helping Elizabeth because if she had been our only waitress, I'm sure we wouldn't have gotten any service at all. I wish I remembered the other girl's name because she really was wonderful.

I was still hungry but scared of the restaurants and deli in Circus Circus but I knew Auntie Anne's wouldn't let me down so for dinner, I wanted to try this place but instead I ate a PRETZEL from Auntie Anne's on the way out from this place! 

Worst service and even worse food here at Vince Neil's!! If I could give it 0 stars I would have. 

(Maybe it would have been better if it was Nikki Sixx's restaurant, ha ha.)"}
{"text":"Great food, great ber and most of all great entertainment. Love it.... this place is great,  insanely great fun, and lots of karaoke people even during the week.  Love it."}
{"text":"Service was great. We had to wait but the waitress let us know she was just hit with a large party and that it would be awhile, and seated us anyway. That's all you can ask for. It we had to wait out front with all the empty tables we might have gone elsewhere. The food was surprisingly good for being in Circus Circus. We really didn't know what to expect and thought we might have to eat Mc Ds, or cafeteria food, ugh! To our surprise there was this very cool full on restaurant in the casino! I guess parents have to eat too. So the food...was sort of a mixed bag. I loved my wedge salad. Perfect amount of dressing and bacon! The adult pizza however was a little strange. It was sauce, pepperoni and cheese on a large hot dog type bun?! Not great. The burgers were good, and our 93 year old grandmother was so happy to see soup on the menu. The menu...was very extensive. Great selection, so there are bound to be some good, some not so much. Overall it was a good experience. They might want to have their music videos digitally remastered or something. It was like watching tv in the 80s, the picture quality was not great, but maybe that's what they were going for. The full 80s experience!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the worst back corner location in an obscure crotchety Las Vegas hotel/casino.. Then throw in the worst margarita on the rocks you could imagine (first one had no margarita mix at all, that was sent back and replaced with one that tasted like watered down lemonade. That's when the waitress says, we just got a new triple sec and no one likes it!) I personally think it's Vince Neil's crappy tequila, or the ball sweat he used to brew it. 
It's hard to talk bad about the food. It's safe, but it doesn't wow. It simply served the purpose of being edible and filling me up.. 
All in all, the only thing more depressing than the lack of an atmosphere and the worst margarita in the history of alcohol itself were the looks of self-deprivation on each of the employees faces. I honestly felt bad because you knew that they knew they are working at the worst restaurant in Las Vegas! Save yourself! This place shouldn't be open much longer so hurry up and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Get your eat on!  Get your drink on!  Get your rock on!  
Tatuado is a crazy fun spot to do it all.  We came here for a birthday dinner but stayed for the show.  The menu is great - all sort of options to choose from - appetizers all the way through to dessert.  
We started with nacho appetizers and they didn't disappoint.  A huge portion with all the toppings and the meat/chili sauce on it was insane good. For dinner I went with the Hombre Burger - a chorizo/beef mixture with guacamole, cheese and these weird little chip strips that gave it a nice crunch.  But the bun.  Oh that bun!  It was this soft bun with melted cheese and jalapenos on top.  To be honest?  I could have just eaten the bun and been totally satisfied.  I kid you not, rock star!
At 7pm the party really starts.  Karaoke, anyone?  There's a big stage on one side of the restaurant and tables and booths surround it.  The karaoke master (I just made that title up but it's super appropriate) is a way talented dude who can belt out almost any genre and make it entertaining.  He was funny, engaging and even on a Sunday night didn't have to beg people to participate.  
The restaurant is full of rock and roll memorabilia with tons of photo ops.  My particular favorite was the outfit displays and in particular, the one with the photo of 2 adult entertainers and the words \"I love single moms\" emblazoned across it.  Well, this is Motley Crue, guys!  
I'm hoping this place does well.  It's got all the right features - good food, decent prices (slightly more expensive than a neighborhood restaurant but much less than most LV Blvd spots), a fun atmosphere and karaoke!  Tourists should take advantage of this unique joint and as locals, we'll most definitely be back!  Rock On!"}
{"text":"First of all the promotion that they have a Groupon is beyond out of this world you get a huge delicious cheesecake and a bottle of wine and two steak dinners all for $39 Of course you pay the tax and the tip. The restaurant was clean and has a nice theme to it, our waitress was nice. The steak was cooked perfectly and their vegetables are real vegetables that did not come frozen and you can tell somebody took the time to cut them and sauté them to perfection. I will have a highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme burger was messy but worth it. It's a delicious sweet and savory combo. Chili and mozzarella sticks were also tasty."}
{"text":"My best friend and I go to Vegas every year for her birthday and we're always looking for different deals and things to do. We found a deal on Groupon for a steak dinner and bottle of wine so we thought we'd check it out. Let me just say this place was awesome not only was the staff extremely friendly the food was great and had a great time. We had two eight ounce New York steaks that were cooked to perfection the vegetables were mouthwatering and the fries were crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir with our dinner that paired well.  I can't say enough about this place. I highly recommend coming to this place for dinner it's a unique experience the food was delicious and the staff was amazing. Will definitely be back.  Hidden gem."}

left the bar without being served. this is completely unacceptable! more

I will b returning to this bar to file a formal complaint. Ezekiel u r a subpar employee and u should b held accountable for ur non actions"}
{"text":"I began staying at Circus Circus years ago for business trips that averaged 1-2 weeks per month. Over the years, I have watched Circus and the venues within evolve and change. The one constant, is the remaining staff whom I consider long term friends. Three years ago, I decided to move back home to Vegas, and I still visit Circus regularly when able. I return because of the friendly staff, good food, low prices, good gaming, but mostly because I love the atmosphere. It reminds me of old Vegas and it never lost its charm. Without DJ Miguel, DJ DJ, the flair bartenders (too many to mention however, Vince Neil's lost some of the BEST in the city to competition) Susie (cocktail) Bob (the pit), MANY employees in the West Deli... Circus would lose my business and the business I bring into town(I ALWAYS recommend it). 

While there will always be a \"prettier\" place to stay and play... Circus and Vince Neils/Rockin Ritas will ALWAYS be my favorite as long as the one constant stays... that is - the staff. They provide awesome customer service, and a place that I can get away and enjoy old friends, gamble, eat, party, sing, dance...and feel at home all at the same time."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but there was a great deal on LivingSocial for two 44-ounce margaritas for $26, so can't complain. Inside the Circus Circus, so it attracts a different crowd than what you'd see more south of the strip-typically older or lower class. Just zip in for a cheap drink special. I can't review the food, but the drink was very typical frozen drink for Vegas, comparable to Fat Tuesday or any other option like this in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stunningly awful on every level imaginable. Not sure where to start. The food was horrid (my wife is not sure what her relleno was filled with, the fish taco was covered with a mystery sauce but my quesadilla was a-okay). 

Watery drinks, store bought guacamole. Stale chips. All compounded by blaring Crüe videos endlessly looped on multiple overhead TV monitors. Sound hellish? It is, but we laughed so hard it almost made it worth our time and money. Almost.

Avoid at all costs!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here.  Live music, great waiter and tasty food at a reasonable price.  

Kid friendly but be warned the music is a bit loud for little ones.  (Hey, it's Vince Neil's place..  if it wasn't a bit loud it'd be just wrong.)

I ordered the Krispy Kreme Burger.  If you like Krispy Kreme donuts (and who doesn't!?) and burgers, it's a must-order.   Loved it!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars based on the staff alone, but food, cleanliness, and quality are a different story. The only redeeming quality of this visit was our bartender, James. 
I purchased a groupon, based on a 4.5 star rating with almost 6,000 reviews. 
To start, the pics online are way exaggerated for what it actually is.  I can tolerate decent drinks and subpar food, but it's in a filthy environment. (Please see pics).  I've stayed on the strip, Fremont street, and other areas. I've always been curious about circus circus based on reviews. 
Buyer beware, it's disgusting. They advertise buckets of chicken on their IRD menu, which says a lot about their quality of food. 
I would not recommend this restaurant based on the quality or environment. The steak included with groupon reminds me of steaks included with premium night in the dorms during my college days. 
Just don't do it. 5 star service, 1 star food."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was a soda and karaoke night the food wasn't good at all I had to nachos the buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks the mozzarella sticks were poorly season didn't taste like much the nachos were borderline disgusting and actually then buffalo wings weren't that bad."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon and had the two Nee York steaks and a bottle of of red wine. it came with fries and vegetables. This is the first time I've bought a Groupon and been disappointed with the food. The fries tasted like they sat under the warming lamp for 10 minutes before our order was placed. definitely not the heat and texture you would expect. the New York steak was full of grisle and tough. The bottle of red wine was Rex Goliath Pinot Noir and even though it was uncorked in front of us it tasted old. I can say that we definitely will never go back"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to celebrate her birthday here when she got a Groupon for this place. The steak that came with fries and veggies cooked medium was chewy then you could still eat it just had to chew a little more. The cheesecake was delicious and big enough to share with another person. This restaurant also has karaoke so you can eat your meal and sign up to sing which is fun if you like to do karaoke. My friend got free tequila shots then I don't really drink a lot or even like tequila so she had 2 shots and she liked it."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, already having a bad hotel stay. Let's start, the place is obnoxiously loud with real bad kareoke, try turning it down a notch, the distortion was real bad. The food, coupon for the 2 8 inch strip steaks. Wife ordered hers medium, more well, they said they could do mine blue, but was beyond dried out and was 50 percent rubber with lots of grizzle and fat, more like a 2 ounce? steak with crap on it. Thanks steak fries were cold with no seasoning, the fried veggies were mainly bellpeppers with a piece of zucchini. Disappointed wouldn't be the word, what has happened to Las Vegas? The wine was a cheap screw top white...steak is supposed to come with red....a joke of a special. Vince they are putting a crap product to your name. The last thing trying to take my picture at a meal is a no no.  I want peace and quiet. Never again"}
{"text":"We got the stake dinner and wine off of Groupon and it was really good staff was great"}
{"text":"It was above average food.  We all enjoyed the meal.  It was a great deal with the groupon we had.  Full price might have made or less appealing,  food wise.  

The staff was nice,  service was good and the place has a great vibe.  We would go back,  with a coupon."}
{"text":"First impressions not good, waiting for food still, but margaritas taste like flat fruit juice with a splash of alcohol and leave an aftertaste, taste like a bad pre mixed.  Also the regular Coke was flat and lousy. Hopefully food we're waiting for will be better."}
{"text":"awesome food, great service, festive atmosphere, fun, lots of 80's 90's Rock music in the air .."}
{"text":"Ok it started off slow, first off my best friend wanted to come especially for the toilet bowl  drinks and they were out of those cups. Then we asked about the 2 for 1 yard coupon in the book we got when we checked in only to be told they don't do that anymore. Then they start karaoke music with a cowboy host singing country music, which I just don't care for. We thought we were going to just walk out, but decided to at least try the food to give a fair review and I am so glad we stayed. They turned a one star night into a 5 star night. I ordered the Krispy Kreme burger. It sounds funny but was one of the best burgers I have had. Our server Joe, was amazing. His goal was just to make us happy and he found two of those toilet bowl cups for us. As for the karaoke cowboy, he turned out to be so amazing we stayed the entire night. I didn't know we were going to get a show with our dinner. It ended up being one of the most fun nights I've had out with my best friend and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  I tried the nachos, loaded fries, and the wings.  Amazing.  Also I come here every Monday and Tuesday just to be on stage for karoake and be a superstar for two nights.  Definitely should check it out then, you would be amazed how many talented people there are here these nights.  Rock on!!!"}
{"text":"On a whim we had stopped at this place. Fortunate for us, there was a Groupon Deal.  We got the steak dinner and it was fantastic. If given the chance, i would patronize this business again.  It's inside Circus Circus and if you are unfamiliar with the location, it is always good to ask."}
{"text":"SUPER LET DOWN.... We came here to watch the Super Bowl and first thing the TVs were from the 70's and the one by us was bouncy and not clear, if your planning a Super Bowl party you need to upgrade that stuff and add more TVs around the bar.... Second if your hosting a Super Bowl party you should be Neutral and unbiased or disclose that it's a specific team party and not have other staff members Taunting the other team with the fans...Third they were doing raffles which was great but sometimes it would interfere with the game audio and we paid to listen to the game and watch it"}
{"text":"Okay all, I give 4 stars for a combination of reasons.  It is not a 4 star dining experience for sure, BUT!  
We are staying at Circus Circus,  they are open and not crowded at 8 am.  We had hotel coupons for breakfast food and I have comp points to pay for food.
Now. The breakfast menu is comprised of 2 items.
There is a 2x2x2 standard fare eggs, bacon and pancakes  or steak and eggs.  We had steak and eggs.
The steak was about a 6 or 7 Oz strip, cooked decently,  my medium order was a bit under cooked, more like med rare, but for me still okay.  The over medium eggs were perfect, the side of potato were averarge, not bad So , all in all decent.  The coffee was hot and fresh and verry good.  The waitress was friendly and okay. A bit slow for service but since she was the only one here, I give her props!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I purchased a Groupon deal for a steak dinner with a bottle of wine and cheesecake, and it did not disappoint. 30 dollars for a steak dinner for two on the Strip, and we loved it. The atmosphere was great, the food was amazing, and the service was excellent. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a coupon at groupon and says 29 for 2 steaks and 1 bottle of wine. So we used but they charge Us like 5 $ more so we don't understand that. The food was great, and the experience was amazing ! DJ Miguel really make that we enjoy our dinner, he was funny and make photo booth for free for Us... Really nice place. I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Friday late afternoon and they did not have the Samuel Adams beer I ordered. I changed to Corona, again, on the menu, and of course, they did not have any! I ate the wedge salad - great taste, fresh and crisp lettuce. Hubby had their regular burger. No condiments on this at all - no mayo, no ketchup, nothing. Service was less than average; server not engaged. Went back 7 am breakfast on Monday. Server was Kendra and she was awesome! Breakfast was good; nothing special, though.  Kendra was friendly, engaged and attentive. Great decor, lots of memorabilia, music videos playing on all screens. I wouldn't seek this restaurant out and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, but if you're staying at Circus Circus, 7.99 steak and egg breakfast with server, Kendra, sounds good and maybe just wander around and look at the pictures!"}
{"text":"The food was super yummy. The steak was so good, I didn't even need A1 sauce. The meal came with grilled veggies and fries. Plus we had a cheese cake to share. I am so glad we got the Groupon. It was an $80 value plus it came with a bottle of wine. We came on a Monday night so we sat right in front of the stage where the patrons could participate in Karaoke if they wished. Nice experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, karaoke and food! Service was attentive and personable. Out celebrating my birthday and this is a good stop for a quick bite and entertainment before hitting the town."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my friends and didn't even know that it was the opening night. The restaurant is located in Circus, Circus. Its got a real edgy rocker decor as it should. There's also lots of cool pics on the wall of other rockers and a cool display of clothing in the back along with an art gallery of rock and roll themed art. Its noisy but its a party atmosphere and the t.v.'s play motley crue videos. 

As far as the food and drinks, they are priced decently, nothing too expensive. For my drink, I ordered \"the groupie\" which is made with a bubblegum flavored vodka. I didn't care for it too much because it was way to sweet and loaded with syrup, my friend also complained of his drink being the same way. For food, I had the Bang, Bang Shrimp. On the menu, it was described as shrimp dusted with some kind of seasoning and spice with bacon, sliced carrots, zucchini and squash with a scoop of jasmine rice. What I got was soggy vegetables, barely any bacon, 5 pieces of shrimp and rice that wasn't jasmine swimming in a bath of spicy creme sauce. It wasn't what I was expecting when I read the description of the dish. I ate as much of it as I could, plus the rice was a little undercooked. Next time I come back, I won't get this again.

Aside from the food, we all had a great time and as an added bonus, Vince Neil was actually there! He came over to our table and took a pic with our friends who were big fans. It was super cool of him to do that. It was opening night, so there is still time for the place to work out the kinks in the food department, but other than that, we did eat, drink and party."}
{"text":"Food was great!! So odd there was a young lady taking pictures of all the families in the restaurant and totally disregard our family. However we were the black family in the entire restaurant and thee only family she didn't snap a picture of."}
{"text":"We came here for a steak and wine dinner on Thursday and were thoroughly impressed. The wine we had was very nice and the steak was so tender. They had DJ Miguel entertaining during our visit and we had so much fun! I love how DJ Miguel really encouraged people to get up on stage and he interacted with everyone in such a fun way! We ended up staying longer than we had planned just to continue watching! The drink specials were also very reasonable. I will definitely come back here on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying our afternoon lunch service was the worst. Our waiter seemed like he was in a hurry instead of being attentive and no, it wasn't that busy inside. 

We ordered the nachos for an appetizer and it was not appetizing at all. It reminded me of a sloppy Tex mex meets \"I'm trying to be healthier\" nachos. The nachos was heavily smothered in watery chili (no meat sauce), red beans, tons of jalapeños, olives and what seemed like nuked shredded cheese on top of the chips. I don't recommend it but to each is own. 

My better half ordered the All American Burger and I ordered the Egg You Burger. 
The burgers looked good when they arrived at our table and tasted delicious at 1st bite. 

Our ghost waited never came to ask us how we were doing until towards the end of our meal. Napkins were needed and so was a glass of water. I asked for a to go cup to take my ice tea with me and he ignored that request and brought us the bill instead. 

Where did they get this guy from?! Ugh. 
1 star is for the burgers."}
{"text":"Vince Neil's is a great bar and grille inside Circus Circus full of Mötley Crüe memorabilia. However, the place is definitely under-staffed. The steak fries are delicious and the burgers are pretty good as well. The Wild Side BBQ Bacon burger was excellent and the Mac & Cheese Feelgood delight was good also."}
{"text":"Ok at best. Service is slow. Food is ok. Menu selection is limited. Atmosphere is good if you love the 80s."}
{"text":"Chronically average breakfast at best.  Out of all the terrible options at circus circus.  This was a close your eyes and hope for the best type situation.  If it wasn't for the $7.77 breakfast, it would have been extremely overpriced breakfast and food options.  Seeing what everyone at my table got, the food is way over priced for the quality of what you get.  The coffee tastes like something you get at the tire shop while your waiting to get a flat repaired. And the jelly packets tastes like  they are at least a few years old as they are aluminum tasting.  Not to mention the fake butter packets....first ingredient vegetable oil.  Yum!!!!  Just like grandma use to make.  They didn't even make the rubber pancakes taste better.  

Sadly a wasted meal experience in Vegas.  Words of advice.  Do not eat here.  Denny's would be a better option and that's terribly sad.  In general eat before you come to circus circus unless you want to be stuck with cafeteria food like options which will have you regretting it later.  

Luckily our slow service allowed for some reflection time (one waitress for 9 tables).  When on vacation I will never sacrifice another meal in Las Vegas.  Vince Neal you should be ashamed of yourself for putting your name on such a shotty restaurant.  Shame on you dude......have you ever even been here ??? I dare you to come and eat breakfast and leave satisfied.  BS man.   You owe me $22 for a crappy meal."}
{"text":"It took quite some time to get menus after we were seated. A waitress saw me and asked if we wanted menus. Well obviously. She brought some and took our orders. It took about 30 minutes to get my dad's breakfast steak plate out. He ate it. Finished it. Even went to the restroom and my shrimp tacos still hadnt came. Was ready to cancel them.  Til a man brought them out and didn't even apologize for the wait. Food isn't bad. Customer service wasn't the best. Sitting at the restaurant as I write this. I haven't even gotten my check and we've been sitting fotnquite some time"}
{"text":"Steak was good, service was good, awesome price. Champagne is good as well. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that my generation had some great talented artist like Vince Neil. I can't say much about these teenager they have Miss Justin Beaver. Now I will get attack by all the beaverettes out there. 

We decided to eat at Tatuado. We approached the front and no one to greet us. The bar tender saw us but ignored us. We were about to leave and the phone rang, we saw someone coming to the front to answer the phone. Finally we got seated. 

This is what we ordered...........

Pina Colada... it was all pina colada syrup with a spit full of alcohol and no ice. It tasted like cheap pina colada. 

Mac and Cheese... My daughter is a mac and cheese fanatic she didn't like it at all. It came with fries. Fries were actually really good. 

Shrimp tacos....The shrimp were grilled from one side only. It was just ok. The pico de gallo was to die for. That was the best pico de gallo I have ever tasted. Vince Neal needs to have his own pico de gallo brand. It came with chips and salsa. I ate 2 tacos and destroyed the 3rd one. Did not eat the chips and salsa. 

Spaghetti... It had the smallest meatballs I have ever seen. I did not tried it but he said it wasn't good at all. He said it was bland and needed seasoning. He did not get garlic bread or anything to go with his spaghetti. 

Cheesecake... It was not good at all!! 

Everything came to $60 including tip. My daughters meal was free with a coupon they were giving away at the casino. We left hungry and very disappointed. Our waiter was super nice and very pleasant to deal with. Sorry Vince but we did not like the food. You need another chef and better management. There should be someone in the front greeting customers and kick ass food."}
{"text":"Ordered room service from this place because conveniently there was a card in our room. They said they'd be here in 30 mins, an hour later our food finally shows up. I ordered the carnitas tacos, they're EXTREMELY dry. It came with a side of unsalted plain tortilla chips and a couple lime slices. I got no salsa, no sauce of any kind, nothing. Not sure what I'm supposed to do with plain chips. It took me forever to eat one taco because of how dry it is. My boyfriend got a burger and fries, both were soggy when we got it. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get paid &
$16.20 for a burger with Mack and cheese on it got 8 fries with it no mayo lettuce or tomato or onion nothing I've been a chef for 20 years bad bad bad wast of money"}
{"text":"My friends and I ate there last night and the wings were really great! They were crispy and all wings not drums which I like more! And the bartenders were so nice to us!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  I really like their version of the sliders.   But the service is a Las Vegas crap shoot.  The first night I ended up going to the bar to get a refill on my beer after waiting a long time for my waiter to show back up.   The second time I sat at the bar and service was prompt the whole night.  The third time, I again sat at the bar and after the initial beer couldn't get the bartender to come back over for a food order.  Another gentleman got to the bar just after me and also could not get the bartender to come back for a food order after the initial beer.  Two more gentleman sat down at the bar after us and never got a drink order in.  They finally left after 15 minutes with no attention.  I set cash down for the beer and headed to McDonald's instead.  The other guy also left cash for his beer and exited.  When it works, it's a fun place with karaoke in the evenings.  When it doesn't though, you wish you had never, ever heard of the place."}
{"text":"Went on a Groupon. Steak was ok but no big deal  the wine was a 3 dollar bottle. No wonder why it was free."}
{"text":"Wife & I had a great time! My wife bought a Groupon for a dinner for 2.  2 strip steaks, sides , bottle of wine & cheese cake .  What a deal! 
Had karaoke so my wife got to sing..  will be back for sure."}
{"text":"From the get go Micheal and Crystal surpassed my expectations. We made reservations for a bday and to my surprise the VN booth was ours, 1 dedicated server. The bday (me) got spoiled rotten. The food was good. The people that got the jambalaya said it was amazing. The burgers great stuff. Before people freak out about price it is Las Vegas nothing is exactly cheep. Crystal you and your staff are ROCK STARS. We will be in next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Waiter took about 15 mins to ask us for drinks then it took 10 minuted after that ti get our drinks and half an hour to get our food and there were only 2 other tables.  My husband got a Caesar salad with chicken and they didn't put any dressing on it and the chicken was dry.  I paid $15.99 for a steak salad and got about a cup of salad with a sliced steak that was 40% fat.  Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was actually decent, the 2 Long Island Ice Teas I bought were garbage, our waiter seemed to be here there and everywhere, the manager needs to do a better job...."}
{"text":"CAlled in advance to check time of karaoke.  Left a beautiful bar at the Cosmopolitan to get my karaoke on and get there to have them shut down a half hour in after ordering drinks.  When I asked to speak to manager about being given wrong info for times, he was dismissive and didn't even offer to complete our drinks we had just ordered."}
{"text":"We read many reviews that said bad things about this place. But we got steak dinners and the steak was very good and tender! Mashed Potatoes were delicious and homemade! Chicken quesadilla was huge and delicious! Overall we found this place to be quite a surprisingly good dinner!
We also found a really good Groupon to help us with the price!
Our server was great, and very friendly!
The fact that it is in Circus Circus made us think it must be a dive. But we really enjoyed ourselves and will go back again!"}
{"text":"I wish they had negative 5 stars here. They are rude as hitler here. go get a hot dog next door."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars but only because of TITO!! He's AMAZING!! Such a good bartender. He is very attentive. We came Thursday and Friday night and he gave great service. We ate both nights. Food is average. But he really made the experience"}
{"text":"They definitely paid for the \"Best of last Vegas 2016\" there is no way they won legitimately. The ribeye tasted like rubber and the chicken was also charred (who doesn't want some carsinagens with dinner) and dry! The only way the chef knows to make it the food tasty is to smother it in pounds of cheese looking at the other plates at the table. As someone else in my party said \"Chili's would be better\".... Couldn't agree more!!!!"}
{"text":"What a discrace! Firstly, we were told we could each eat for around $20. Ummm, no. The kids menu maybe. I'm wearing a snappy little black dress, so my legs are exposed. The host sat me at a booth with such torn vinyl it was scratchy and unsanitary. We finally tracked down another host and was sat at a table literally in a puddle of water. Totally unsafe for a lady in heels!  It was dead and loud, there's no excuse. We left before eating.
(I have included a pic of the ratty ass booth for your discernment)"}
{"text":"Did the Groupon dinner. Great deal.  The steak was cooked perfect. I like it med/rare,  they nailed it perfectly. My wife said the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  The fry's were steak fry's.  They were crispy on the out side hot and soft in the inside. Great when you are looking for a steak. 
Our waiter was very good."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was great from the meal I had. Just wish they had more options."}
{"text":"Great, authentic veggie burger, kind and prompt service, tasty salads, and ample guacamole with a filling amount of tortilla chips is what makes Vince Neil's a great place to eat.  Staff is also very accommodating whether you show up solo or with an entourage. The manager was actively involved in ensuring each guests level of satisfaction with their meal and was sure to make me feel welcomed and not rushed. Good experience."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! After taking the kids to Adventuredome, we decided to get some food here upon the recommendation of a staff member at Circus Circus. If I could find this person again, I would shake some sense into her. WORST SERVICE EVER!! The waitress took forever to take our drink order, got the order wrong...twice! There was only 1 other family when we got there, yet apparently the 3 other families that got there 20-40 mins after us were very lucky since they got their food first. We finally get our food after 40mins and the spinach dip has curdled so bad, it was a clumpy disgusting mess. When the manager finally comes over, his excuse is that it all depends on when the food order went in. Yeah right! How can someone who came in 30 mins after us get there food first if we had already been waiting 20mins for ours? Spinach dip apparently is way too complicated. After complaining, the waitress comes over to refill the kids' drinks and mixes my nephew's soda. She looks confused at the different colors she just mixed. Oh lord! It sucked from start to finish. The only reason we didn't leave half way through was that the kids were starving. I had to walk out since I didn't eat and couldn't stand the awful service. I wish I could shut this place down. Save your money, time and frustration."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the steak dinner deal with wine and cheesecake. First steak I've had in a while that was cooked the way I liked even my wife liked hers and she's not the biggest steak fan, the wine was very good also and the waiter was even able to explain the types of wine to us as we are not wine drinkers"}
{"text":"Food not that great burger was dry the Spanish dip way too salty as if they threw the bottle on it. Not worth to eat here but to watch sports its good."}
{"text":"I didn't sit inside, but rather at the bar outside of the restaurant; Still part of the business.
The bartender, as it turned out, was from Edmonton (I'm from Calgary) Good attitude, good service. He was pulling off some pretty impressive moves with both the practice and real bottles. Was a good source of entertainment over a couple beers in my pretty, pink cup. I had to even out my masculinity, so teamed it with a cigar.
A good stop on the way through one of my favourite childhood hotels."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The people, the vibe. We first came here over a year ago to check out the kareoke. DJ Miguel is the shit! Ive never seen a DJ/KJ with so much personality! Brandon is our favorite!!!! Everytime we come we always ask to be seated at his section. We have celebrated my husbands birthday there the last 2 birthdays. The people that work there really make the restaurant and experiance what it is. Its always such a pleasure coming here. That's for being awesome you guys. Till next time..."}
{"text":"Wow! 25 July 2015, 2 PM visit.  Visited with the family and ran into no complications or issues like other Yelpers reviewed.

Service - not bad today a total of 18 minutes from seating to our food arrival.

Costumer Service hostess and server (Brandon) professional and friendly

Menu - order the Hot wing with BBQ Sauce highly recommend with ranch sauce 

80s and 90s Rock decor!

A return visit when we do return to this city."}
{"text":"The food included a turkey burger that had a blackened bottom from being burnt, even though I was charged for an extra side I was never given it. The entire time we were there we never got utensils to eat with and our table had two empty ketchup bottles. Our waitress only came to take our order once then when we had to flag her down after 10-15 minutes of not seeing her at all even though it wasn't even busy. She never refilled our drinks. Our kids were crying and fussy after we waited around 30-45 minutes to get our food. Spare yourself - the only memorable part of this dining experience was that it was probably the worst food and service I have ever gotten at any restaurant. This is the only negative review I have ever written and I am pretty forgiving but this was bad."}
{"text":"This was a super-confusing concept. This restaurant is inside Circus Circus. And, it must have been child karaoke night. It's probably not fair that I loath karaoke for starters, but, this was child-karaoke! Like, 5 years old & you cant even make out what the shy-mumbles are, it was embarrassing for everyone involved. There was nothing hard core rock & roll about this place. I just wonder if Vince Neil knows this is going on or if he just slapped his name on a Chuckee Cheese.

We stood a the host stand for a few minutes until a line formed behind us & eventually someone in a tie sat us. We sat at our table for about 10 minutes before a server noticed us. We had a Groupon & it appeared that everyone else around us did, too. 2 steaks w/ a bottle of win & a huge slice of cheesecake for $40 is pretty good, except that it turns out it was barely just OK. My husband ordered his steak rare, it came out medium to medium-well, so, not even close. The fries were good & the cheesecake was huge & tasty. Food came out quickly. But we scarfed it & took the bottle of wine home b/c we just wanted out of there! The karaoke was sooo horrid. Honestly, if kid-karaoke wasn't going on, I would have gladly given it more stars. We were miserable while we were there, but, now looking back, it was a laughing point in our trip."}
{"text":"We came in here with groupon. The steak was great and service was normal. 

Server spilled A1 sauce into my leg and wasn't really apologetic about it. She brought wet wipes and that was about it. 

The environment was pretty neat and punk. I would come back again if I come by Vegas. 

Parking is hectic. Have to park far away in the garage and walk in the alley. So darkness might not be the best time to walk in the alley."}
{"text":"yes the best service, food was great not very expensive, and karaoke was the best entertainment.."}
{"text":"Loved the Motley Crue memoribilla. We stayed at Circus Circus it came with a coupon for two steak dinners with wine for $30.00 . The meal was cooked perfect and flavorful. We had the opportunity to experience karaoke . I was amazing at the different entertainment styles .The restaurant has many different area's to explore."}
{"text":"This is an unbelievable deal through Groupon for a really really good steak dinner!  $39 for 2 8oz NY Strip steaks that were grilled to perfection; steak fries and excellent vegetable medley! But wait, there's more!!! A bottle of wine and a giant piece of NY Cheesecake to share! 
Great fun place, with music videos playing, and Karaoke from 7:30 to Midnight!
DON'T MISS GOING HERE!"}
{"text":"+ The FOOD was good, I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. They have good music & lemonade. The staffs nice.

- I found a hair on one of the noodles. GROSS. The wait is ridiculously long, like 30-40 or MORE! The waitress kept messing up our order & receipt. She takes forever to give you your check."}
{"text":"Went here before we were going to a show and should of had plenty of time to eat and get to show. We ordered and 35 minutes later no food. And the place wasn't that busy,so we left money on the table and left don't go here."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviewsin groupon and a lot of people gave this restaurant 4 stars so I wad expecting really good food and service. The service was bad, the server saw we had a groupon and just asked how would we like our steaks and what kind of wine we wanted, we asked her questions about wine and she said \"idk, I don't drink wine\" . We asked for water and had to wait 20 min for it, and she never came back to refill it. 

Portions were very small the steak was very dry and rubbery. We also ordered guacamole and chips, the guacamole had no flavor at all we had to put some salt and pepper to make it a little better. The cheescake was very good, this was the only thing we like really like."}
{"text":"Had the Groupon for two NY Steak dinners, with your choice of a bottle of wine and cheesecake for two.  Great food and was prepared to our liking.  Awesome food.  Awesome price.  Bertha provided excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. I Yelp this place before I ate there. Wasn't going to go but the party I was with we're already seated and had ordered and have been waiting for me. Wrong move."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night.  One section was closed, so I had to wait about 5 minutes.  No big deal.  The server was great!  Food, not so much.  I had the pulled pork tacos, which contained more cilantro than pork.  The pork in the tacos was dry.  I had to ask for more salsa to get the tacos down.  If I stay at Circus Circus again, I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Cheap steak and eggs on the strip in Circus Circus.

What can I say, we were playing in the midway at Circus Circus and my gf was craving for some steak and eggs. So who else comes into mind rather than Motley Crew!

Well the service wasn't that bad. Pretty attentive. However, the steak was really dry and chewy. However, we didn't really complain considering it was $8. Also the breakfast platter was $6.50 for pan cakes, eggs, sausage and sour dough toast.

Overall, the food is average. Nothing special here asides from the decoration and live music that goes on here. Definitely, more of a place to drink and watch live music rather then eat."}
{"text":"Two stars only because the food was good, but definitely not worth the inflated prices. Service was slow, especially for the $24 gratuity that was automatically added into the bill. We only had 5 damn people on our check. Weak margaritas.. Will definitely NOT be back."}
{"text":"We came here to escape the hordes of children running around the casino bumping into everything that moved. This place looked quiet enough and didn't have many afternoon diners. 
It's  a dark restaurant with lots of interesting memorabilia everywhere. 

My friends ordered the ribs- they were meh. I had wings and fries which were meh. In fact, everything we ordered was just plain average. Even my Corona Michelada was small and bland tasting. 

This isn't a place I'd go out of my way to visit but it served its purpose while we were there."}
{"text":"Management and staff are simply the BEST..  Always a wonderful time...Great Service with a smile. Food Quality and presentation is awesome....You MUST try the Award winning Cheese Cake...the Cheese Cake Factory can't come close to this recipe. Tito, Yu, John and other's do great behind the Bar...Christine & other's are Great Hostess... Don't forget the complimentary photos.. and purchase more.. the deal can't be beat.  Eat..Drink & Party.  It's a MUST visit when in Las Vegas. Check out the newest addition Michael T's and if traveling stop in Pahrump and Visit Vince Neil's amazing Manager... Bar staff.. entertainment and value for the dollar"}
{"text":"Worst service I can recall ever receiving while dining out. Additionally, the manager, Jose was combative when I tried to let him know. Sadly, the interaction with him escalated quickly when I called into question the fact that he was eating in bar area, oblivious to the costumers being ignored. (The table next to us was literally waving their arms trying to be noticed, to no avail).  I have NEVER written a negative review before- I have worked in the food industry myself and know that anyone can have an off day, however, the combination of bad service from MULTIPLE staff members and poor management have compelled me to do so now. Stay away until new management is in place."}
{"text":"Went there a couple months ago and I gotta tell you that this place has changed for the better. Service was great Sherzod the server was amazing he was at your table side just enough to know your needs right before you realized you needed something like a refill on a beverage. Will go back a hundred times over. And the food presentation has improved by 10 fold. Thanks guys for a great experience."}
{"text":"Eh, I definitely wouldn't go back here unless I absolutely had to.  Yep, we had THAT much fun!  Here's why:

1. The food is mediocre at best.  The menu items sound good, but they all lacked in follow through.  I had a burger and I think I would have rather gone to a fast food place instead and would have been happier.  My daughter had pancakes and they were blah, IHOP has better ones and for cheaper too.

2. The hot mess that was the kitchen.  I have no idea what was going on, but it was bad.  We got there on a Tuesday afternoon just after 12pm.  There were only 3 tables sat when we walked in.  Our server was great and super fast.  We ordered and then the wait started.  It was over 40 minutes before our food came out.  We kept asking if they had an ETA and they just kept saying it was coming.  When the food did come out, the plates were super hot but the food was warm at best.  My daughter's pancakes were rubbery and cold on a scalding hot plate. The only food that came out at the right temp was the scrambled eggs on a different plate.  Complete disappointment across the board.

Also, but this time, most of the tables were sat and no one was getting their food at all, so it was a whole kitchen issue.  There were plenty of servers who were doing great.

My dad wanted to just leave, but there really wasn't anywhere else to eat in the place that wasn't fast food or a buffet, and we needed to be on property for other commitments. 

It's hard to even write this review because I love me some Vince Neil and Motley Crue, but something needs to be fixed ASAP."}
{"text":"Stay away !!! 
This was the worst restaurant yet . The Place was empty , which should have been my first clue. Several waitress were on staff , we just got the wrong one ? I say that because we saw her a total of 2 times . 1st for the drink and food order & 2nd for when I complained and asked for a manager . I ordered a steak salad rare , and my husband ordered chicken fingers with a side of fries . We waited 30 minutes to get our food .. Which is on us , we should have walked out way before then seeing as we were missing a waitress anyway . Once food finally was delivered it was awful! I took 2 bites and waited to speak to manager . I told her what was up and she did the standard so sorry let's take it off your bill. But at the end of the day what does that fix? Your food is embarrassing mediocre and the service Mia !! I am still hungry and now wasted an hour and half on this carnival side show ."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Our waitress named Joy kinda seemed inconvenienced with our presence. I will give this place second chance, hopefully next time I get a waitress that doesn't make us feel like crap for going there."}
{"text":"Be it valentine's day this experience made it worst! Please keep in mind while I tell my experience this place was dead (max maybe 18 customers). It took 15 mins for our waiter to come to our table. After he came to our table our food took about 30 mins to come out. When it came out it was the most Burnt steak I ever had in my life. After speaking to management we were offered more burnt steak. Our waiter never refilled our drinks they were to busy talking near the bar. Listen learned stay away from this place and casino in general. There is way too many other great restruant's that actually care in this town."}
{"text":"I'm being generous to give this place 1 star. The service was ok. We went in with greater expectations only to be disappointed. We stopped in for cocktails and appetizers and were shocked to find that the specialty cocktails are served in plastic cups-a Margarita in a cup? ( Really?! I thought this was a restaurant, but a pool party!) We ordered Drunken Shrimp and Guacamole and chips. The shrimp looked like something you use as bait for bigger shrimp; it wasn't peeled and was overloaded with heat, not spice or flavor. The Guacamole tasted prepackaged or something from Costco. The venue was typical-TV's playing 80's Rock videos were okay, but not of high quality. If you are looking for a better rock-and-roll venue, go to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"We visited Tatuado on a Friday night around 7 p.m. right about when it was starting to get busy.  We had a Groupon for 2 steak dinners and a bottle of wine.  I was surprised that we were able to choose from a variety of wines.  The steak was good sized.  It was cooked exactly as ordered and was tender and had a great flavor.  The vegetables that came with it were well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  We also ordered chicken tenders as an appetizer and I was surprised at the generous portion that we received.  Our server was very attentive.  I love the décor as Motley Crue is my favorite band and the music was a perfect compliment.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Had burgers (one with jalapeños and the other with guac and chorizo) and they were amazing. Fries were really good. Server, Kathryn, was really nice. Only complain was empty water glasses and the delayed pick up of the payment (with the bill). Other than that, everything was good and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Ok. Beer was almost cold. Black and Blue burger was fair at best. Will never eat here again. However your music still rocks b"}
{"text":"Somebody needed to say it.  Michelle is the best bartender in Las Vegas.  Been to the Wynn, been to Cosmo, been to Bellagio.  It doesnt matter.  Somehow the best experience in Vegas happened at Circus Circus.  She poured the best drink, offered the best conversation, and made the night!  Top Notch!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've had at a restaurant in Vegas. Sat here for almost an hour and no one came by. Asked another waitress if I could order already knowing what I wanted and she said she was going to get me a menu anyways and walked off. Since she didn't return, I contacted a manager. Another manager came and waited on me with exceptional service but had to leave shortly after. I had eaten about half my food and still no waiter came by. I had to go to the rest room and stepped out for a second. The bussing staff came and threw my half eaten food in the trash and cleaned the table. Finally a waitress came over and took care of the situation. She replaced the chicken, but only half an order. I appreciated  her getting me more, but it wasn't enough for me to come back to this establishment. There's approximately 25% of staff that cares and isn't rude. Seems like management has failed their customers and their employees."}
{"text":"Our drink order was taken 10 minutes ago and still nothing.  The place isn't that busy right now.  We have no confidence that our food order was even placed.  Really, really bad service!!!!!  If we weren't so hungry we would walk out."}
{"text":"We had friends visiting from the U.K., so we went here more for the ambiance than the food.  They had purchased a Groupon for a meal deal for food for four, which included steak, fries, veggies, dessert and a bottle of wine.  I chose the blue cheese wedge with steak.  My salad was huge.  I only finished half of it and took the rest Home for lunch the next day!  The amount of steak on my salad was very generous.  Everyone was happy with their food!  It was also karaoke night, and that was entertaining!  Members of our group also sang and we created great memories.  Definitely a must for out of town guests!"}
{"text":"The New York strip was awesome.  Loved eating dinner and listening to Karaoke. Great environment. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Cool place, food was good, drinks were good, but!!!!!!they played touch Justin beiber music, they did not play any metal or rock music.... it's vine neils bar for crap sake. Play rock not crap....."}
{"text":"The New York strip steak was cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, probably the worst wedge salad with grilled chicken I ever had ! OMG has management ever sat down and ate their own food? Geez come on for Vegas , you would think they would care what type of food they are preparing.   Never again"}
{"text":"OMG the shrimp tacos are to die for and the cheesecake is made from scratch daily! Service is decent to excellent depending on the waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price.

We only heard about this place by surfing through Groupon, and we are happy we did. I was reluctant at first because you don't really know what to expect at face value being a \"rock restaurant in Circus Circus,\" but we got away with 2 Medium Rare NY Strip Steak meals with a bottle of wine and a THICK slice of cheesecake for super cheap! And I don't even think it was one of those \"you get what you pay for\" type of things... it was genuinely good. 

There was actually Karaoke there that started toward the end of our visit and it was such a fun atmosphere. The host sang \"Love On The Brain\" by Rihanna... in a country accent. I hate country and even I thought he killed it! 

Rachel was very good to us. Really really good service especially considering we came on a groupon I've seen servers give crap service to groupon users elsewhere so I was very thankful they treated us like every other customer.

I recommend."}
{"text":"My family  really enjoyed the food and good service here. Fish tacos were the bomb as well as the jalapeño chedder guac burger. We had lunch and it wasnt too busy. Took the kidos too and it was no big deal. Prices were not too bad, especially compared to other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Wow! I am very impressed. The Cajun Rib Eye Steak was phenomenal! We started off with a couple appetizers, spicy chicken casadilla, and some chips with guacamole. Neither disappointed me one bit. Then for the main course we had Rib Eye Steaks cooked medium, if your craving steak, this is your best bet. They were much bigger then I expected. The portion sizes were very generous for each item we ordered. Drinks were strong, and just what I was looking for. I really would like to add that this place exceeded my expectations, the customer service was excellent from beginning to end. Every hostess, waiter, and even the manager Ivan went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. You will not find many restaurants that can just make you say WOW, especially in a busy city like Las Vegas. If you are looking for a great reasonably priced place to eat that has good entertainment, and that is kid friendly in Vegas, this is your place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The adult mac and cheese was to die for. I never had such a great mac and cheese.  The cheese was dripping and so gooey. I just loved it. I took one star off though because one they ran out of the kids mac and cheese (the waitor did try to give my son the adult mac and cheese in a kids bowl) but ya know kids are picky.  We were there for my kids birthday.  Our friend Eddie did karaoke i really enjoyed the karaoke. We spent a hour and a halfish there. When we left my sister in law sat out of the restaurant  (still there bar area) waiting for myself and kids to come from the arcade above and the bartendar was very rude and yelled at her to get the fuck outta there.  After spending  $200 im sure you wouldnt appreciate being talked to like that either. Now my sister in law friend was buying drinks from there bar however she still had a souvier drink that was from circus circus btw and she was trying to finish it. And thats why the bartendar was upset. He could of been way more professional then that come on. When you buy a drink from circus circus many people as myself assume you can drink it anywhere. (I learned when they took my bongos when entering  restaurant area) which blew my mind cause they had other souviner cups around."}
{"text":"Steak and veggies Groupon special - so we went here on a Groupon. It was a very fun and Lively crowd, and they were having a karaoke contest it's a great place for a date night.  Unfortunately my steak was like a leather insole, I didn't even eat it. But, the cheesecake was really good! I would definitely come back but try another dish next time."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look very good, and that's because it isn't very good. It's really dirty. You can see crud in the corners on the floor that anyone who cared to could easily clean up...but I guess nobody cares to. The food seems old. My tacos were extremely dry (nobody likes a dry taco). Several items didn't match the description on the menu. For example, the menu specifically says items will come with tri-colored corn chips, but everyone got (stale) regular corn chips. My son's chocolate milk was supposed to be covered in marshmallows, according to the menu, but wasn't. These aren't huge problems, but just shows that they don't run a tight ship. The service was good, though. Everything else was disappointing."}
{"text":"Just came from there without even getting our food.  Took twenty minutes to get seated.  We waited half hour and no food... The server was unaware that we didn't recieve our food. I offered to pay for our ice teas and left.  Upon leaving we ran across the manager and explained but she just said well we were busy with the larger parties.  So what,that means forget about everyone else?? I wouldn't suggest this place to eat. Please note: they weren't that busy there wasn't a lot of people there"}
{"text":"I love this place! I stayed for a week at Circus Circus and was lucky this place was there! The wings were awesome, the beer was a great price and the service was top notch! ! I would recommend this place to my friends and family. Not only was this place clean, the entertainment and karaoke were on point."}
{"text":"I ordered the buffalo wings and some of our group had hamburgers. Overall the food was good and great for one of those morning you just gotta soak up the night before.  Things were a little rocky with some dude that had zero menu knowledge messing up our orders, but Tiffany stepped in and everything was smooth sailing.  She was extremely friendly and her recommendations were perfect. Several of us went back during our stay because of her."}
{"text":"we got the groupon for the 2 steak dinners that comes with a bottle of wine and a large cheesecake. our waiter was really nice and helpful. you get to choose from different kinds of wines. it was $39 for the groupon. the steak was tender and juicy. the veggies were good. the steak fries were just the right portion. we got full so we took the cheesecake to go. the cheesecake was not a disappointment. it was delicious. you have to pay taxes on groupon.

we also got 2 margaritas. the bartender hooked us up with a lot of tequila gold. the drinks were too strong for our liking. I felt like we were drinking tequila straight and it's suppose to be a strawberry margarita. lol for some people they would like it that way.

overall, we will be back again. good customer service, good food, strong drinks, and good prices!"}
{"text":"Had the Groupon deal for two 8 oz steaks, fries, some vegetables, and wine. The restaurant has a fun theme but replayed the same 5-6 songs over and over again with music videos on the screens.  Steak was good but the portions weren't that big.  It was good but not worth the normal price of 16$. Would probably not come back unless I used another deal."}
{"text":"Okay so this was one of those things where we gambled and we won. We bought a Groupon for the restaurant for two steak dinners, a bottle of wine, and cheesecake for $30-something. We were so apprehensive about the place after we bought the Groupon and did some research, and that feeling remained until we actually sat down and started having a great time. This was probably our favorite dining experience we had all trip.

Pros:
-Of course the playlist was amazing. They played a lot of 2000's alternative, so we sang along to virtually everything that came on (H.I.M. was played. When was the last time you heard them playing overhead anywhere?) They also have nightly karaoke
-The steak was well seasoned, and the menu covered a lot of different types of food, so there's something for everyone. The cheesecake was vacuumed up in about two seconds, and the wine was a better quality than we thought it'd be.
-The service was exceptional. Our waiter was great, and the GM came out to introduce himself to us.


Cons:
-The restaurant is in Circus Circus and has a separate bar that you find before the restaurant. We saw the bar area first thinking it was the whole establishment and kind of internally freaked out because it was not at all the kind of place we wanted to eat. Thankfully, the bartender told us there was a sit down section, and things picked up from there. Circus Circus should have better signs for it.
-We ordered our steaks medium and they came out done, so just make sure to order one temp down. 
-The price without a Groupon is steep. We paid $36 for everything which is pretty cheap normally, but without the Groupon our dinner would have been about $100.

I'd probably come back with another deal or if I was in Vegas with a rock fan who would enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money, crap food, poor service because short on servers"}
{"text":"Our appetizer was cold, the service was slow. The waiter was almost done with his shift and was not attentive. Our burgers were just okay. The macaroni and cheese was good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, large portions, excellent staff. The steak burrito, nachos, Mac and cheese, and Cajun pasta are all tremendous. I highly recommend this resturant. I was greeted promptly, the drinks and food were delivered quickly. Eat here!"}
{"text":"This is gonna sound snobby, but I knew to expect barely edible food inside Circus Circus so I ordered something that I thought was impossible to F up: Nachos. 

Well, for starters there's no guacamole, no sour cream, just some dry af pico, gigantic pickled jalepenos and COLD PRE PACKAGED CHEESE (ya know the cheap kind that comes covered in some weird white powder?).

Literally the only two things you need to make nachos is chips and MELTED CHEESE...this place couldn't even pull that off."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst food I have ever eaten.  Everything was bland and cold.  One person in my party got sick while we were at the restaurant and myself and the third person in my party were both sick shortly after.  Even our server was just mediocre.  The only thing that wasn't awful was my Miami Vice frozen drink."}
{"text":"The food here was great -- the steak was comparable to the Steak House (in the same building) but at a lower cost.  Staff was friendly, atmosphere is casual and fun as you might expect given a name like \"Eat Drink Party\".  I'd say it's the best place we found on the strip!  Definitely the best at Circus Circus."}
{"text":"To me it seemed like small portions and a bit expensive. 
The drinks the me and my daughter had were a little on the weak side.
We got cheese sticks and loaded fries.
The cheese sticks came and they were hot but were like two bite size so they did not seem to last or fill us.
So we ordered the loaded frys, when they arrived they were hot  woth chili  cheese and onions ,but also had bacon on them.
 I dont really like bacon bit ate them anyway. The other food on the menu did not grab me on wanting to eat.
The drink like I said seemed weak, I got the one call girls girls rum girls. It was supposed to have three type of rum and other stuff
My daughter's drink was mango something.
Like I said weak for the price we paid."}
{"text":"You may have heard about the woman who complained to a restaurant that the food was inedible and the portions were too small. That is not the case at ViNCE NEiL'S. Looking for breakfast at Circus Circus, we found that many restaurants are only open until later. The Buffet? Maybe, but $13.95 for all I can eat? Which isn't all that much. A donut and coffee at Krispy Kreme isn't nutritious at all. So, I saw that Vince Neil's Tatuado (English translation - \"Tattooed\") was open for breakfast. They are tucked away in a far corner of the main level, far away from the front lobby and past the main casino. The place has somewhat of an \"industrial\" ambiance, said to be \"reminiscent of Sunset Strip rock clubs.\" Pictures of rock stars are all around and it does have a cool vibe.

There are several choices for breakfast plates, and they provide an abundance of food. I chose my favorite - chicken-fried steak, country style hash-browns and eggs. And toast. The steak was huge, nice and crisp, and covered in sausage gravy. Yum! My wife had French toast with strawberries and confectioners sugar along with two eggs. She said the strawberries were frozen, not fresh; a bit of a let-down. The others in our party had eggs with big sausage patties and pancakes, and an omelet. 

The good part is that the coupon book provided by the hotel had a coupon good for $2 off each order, which saved us $8.00 - a very good deal. The food was good, more than some of us could eat, and a better deal than the buffet. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and really slow. I get that theyll continue to get business without trying because it's in a busy hotel, but they should probably try just a little harder. 


We were ignored by the host for about 10 minutes while he finished a personal call. We asked him for a high chair and he said \"sure\" and didn't bring us one. It took about 15-20 minutes for someone to take our drink order


The food was expensive and stale


Don't come here"}
{"text":"We went here using the Groupon for 2 steak dinners and a bottle of wine for 26 bucks. The atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding. We were both amazed how good our steaks were.  We would go again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a great breakfast! Their steak and eggs deal is pretty yummy. Only reason they are receiving 3 stars is their bloody Mary's suck! For an alcohol connoisseur such as myself, I loathe paying 8.75 for less than delicious."}
{"text":"I love the makeup of this place. 
It gives off a rock n roll concertish/bar feel. There was a good fried chicken deal going on and we were like hey why not? 
3 piece + fries + cole slaw = delish
All of that for $8.99. food was pretty good for the price. The fried chicken was crispy and hot but I didn't like how it was too dry. Ketchup and hot sauce is definitely needed.

The portion was Pretty big..definitely can feed two average eaters lol. I couldn't even finish all of the food. We had to get the food to go. The staffs were friendly as well. 

Oh yeah! They also have the toilet bowl cup thang here. It was cute and all but pretty pricey...running at $25."}
{"text":"Vince, I love you, and your food at your restaurant is pretty good, the restaurant needs a lot of work. My boyfriend and I went there and our waitress, Julian, was the worst waitress I've ever encountered. She saw us maybe twice for food and drinks, was hiding in the kitchen the whole time, and was talking to the hostess. The bus boy served us more than our waitress, which realllllly pissed me off. I tipped him instead. We waited 30 minutes for our check. The service is absolutely terrible. And my steak was tough and way overcooked. This place needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, drinks , entertainment and staff. Love this place ! Will be my place of choice for future visits to Las Vegas.  Who wouldn't want to be where you are treated like the rock star you are? Never a dull moment, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally got around to eating here when I had a friend in town that was curious about the place. As a die-hard rock and roll fan I had been curious about this place for quite some time.

Vince Neil is quite the businessman away from the music world as well, having run bars, strip clubs, concert venues, marketed his own alcohol, and now this restaurant in Circus Circus. I have noticed a lot of negative reviews, and while I would not go out of my way to dine here again, if I ever found myself in Circus Circus, I would definitely return.

I am a rock and roll fan and an author of concert and album reviews, plus self published books of classic rock/hard rock bands, so the decor on the walls of this place instantly won me over. Posters of album covers, guitars, vintage stage outfits, vintage Mark Weiss photographs; the decor and photos alike make this place a rock fan's dream come true. I had to get out of my seat twice just to walk around and take it all in!

When I first arrived there was no host(ess) at the booth, but a man dressed in a suit and tie (presumably a manager) seated us within two minutes of arriving at the door. This guy treated us well, checked up on us often, and definitely deserves credit for his efforts. Sadly, the restaurant was short staffed and we did not see many other employees around for most of the dining experience. The few people we dealt with treated us well, but even when it was time to get the bill I had to get up and actually ask someone to bring it.

The biggest issue I had with dining here was that, upon being given the menu, the server told us \"the entrees are not available at lunch.\" So in other words, the good majority of the \"major\" menu items, including several I wanted to try, were not available. Not only would having more of these items available have made for a better dining experience; they also would have gotten more money from me! But seriously, how hard would it be to make a separate lunch menu that at least has SOME of the entree choices?

Music was playing on the speakers/televisions throughout the meal, and not just the hard rock you would expect; there were vintage pop songs as well (Beatles, Michael Jackson, etc.) The manager guy said that the heavier stuff plays later in the evening, and that is understandable enough. There was also a live stage set up, though no live entertainment was playing at the time of our visit.

Contrary to what other reviews have stated, I had no problem with the food whatsoever. I got an order of chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were meaty and crispy, and had no tough meat whatsoever. The fries were very crispy and cooked well. Everything I ate in here was delicious, though I would liked to have been able to taste one of the entrees that are supposedly only available come dinner time.

Overall, my visit to Vince Neil's restaurant was a good one, just not a great one. I am not going to park in the parking garage at Circus Circus and fight my way through the casino again for the purpose of eating here, but if I am in the casino again for any reason, I would be willing to dine their again. If you are visiting Circus Circus or the area anyway, I recommend dining here, just keep your expectations in check. Overall I can give Tatuado a modest recommendation."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here. The food is horrible! I didn't have high expectations, I was expecting food along the lines of Hard Rock, but this place should be closed down. I had part of a meatloaf sandwich and part of a burger with mac and cheese on top. Neither had any flavor.  The buns and the fries were stale."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here. We had bought a groupon for two steak plates and wine included. Seriously good. We really like to go out for steak. And this was literally like butter melt in your mouth. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what it might be like to eat in an ash tray?  That's how I felt here!  They certainly capture the dank, rocker, garage feeling, which for me, is not anything you want when eating.  

The food was very average, and the service was lacking.  I did enjoy walking around and seeing all the Vince Neil/Motley Crew paraphernalia.  My daughter got a cold corn dog - need I say more?  Think twice before throwing yourself into this eating experience.  

At the end of our dinner a live act took the stage, which was cool, but it didn't make me forget the food."}
{"text":"First....I refuse to come back here unless Vince Neil is going to be here!!! Came here since I stayed at the hotel. The music was pretty good. They had some old school Motown playing. Loved it. The atmosphere was pretty chill. It was not super busy so no wait. Not bad and pretty clean. 

Food: Had the steak deal which came with a New York strip, fried and vegetables for two, along with a bottle of wine and a piece of cheesecake to share. The food was pretty good, no complaints but nothing I will remember forever or anything. 

Service: Nothing special, it was not bad. He was attentive and nice. About what you would expect in Vegas where there are tons of people. 

It's not bad as long as you use the $39 hotel deal where you get a steak each and the other items mentioned above."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Nothing we ordered had any flavor. We waited a half hour for sliders and shrimp tacos. Over priced and terrible service!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst wait staff I've ever encountered. The food and drinks were ok, the atmosphere is fun, but they have some of the rudest staff I've ever seen. Try somewhere else if you don't want to feel like you're not worth their time."}
{"text":"Don't know why his place has only 2 starts its amazing !! Food is really good and prices are so reasonable . The place is so cool looking too! Our waiter Julian was amazing . Fast friendly friendly and the food was nice and hot . My steak was very good ."}
{"text":"Womp. Mullet lover's paradise. First time in Vegas, we got to our hotel (Circus Circus) very late and immediately headed to the first bar we saw...this one. We received a coupon for BOGO yard drinks here and couldn't wait to get one each! Well, we were completely disgusted by them! The bartender put SO much booze in each of the drinks, which doesn't sound like an issue, but it is when it's the equivalent of Georgi or 99 cent vodka. Then put some of the slushee, and more of the cheap booze on top. VOM (vomit). Even when we mixed it up it was absolutely disgusting, and not wanting to waste our money, had to force ourselves, like pinch our noses from tasting it, to get it down. Once we got halfway down and could mix it up more, the drink was finally okay to drink and gave us each a very nice buzz. We were starving and asked if we could have some food. \"Yeah sure!\" the bartender responded and as excitedly combed the menu. The options looked crazy, wanted to try the Krispy Kreme burger or the mac and cheese . After 10 minutes of excitedly looking and reaching a decision, the bartender tells us he's sorry, but the kitchen is closed. I do want to try their burgers, but this place skeeves me out. If you think TGIFriday's is living large, than you would probably enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The staff are all very friendly and they try hard. The fact is, the food is just not that good. It's airport bar food at best. I'd avoid."}
{"text":"Good all American burger and Rachel the waitress very nice. Only bad took 30 minutes to get our burgers but she explained and apologized due to having a party. It was all the way in a corner seemed like the restaurant we were there by chance or else we would've never seen it. Fries were excellent still hot 15 minutes later and crispy. Burger was good needed just a bit more seasoning. Nothing that I couldn't add so with a little pepper and salt it was all good. Over 7 out of 10 burger and 9 out of 10 fries. Overall I would give this place two thumbs up too bad the hotel is terrible, just old and too many kids everywhere."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a while, even with low expectations. I had the chicken fajita burrito and it was utterly flavorless. This is food you eat to avoid starvation, expect no pleasure from it."}
{"text":"Had the steak for two and a bottle of wine. .(groupon special)
GREAT steak,cooked perfectly. Fries all right ,
nice steam  vegetables. 
The atmosphere was great karaoke night Friday.."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with the food and we will not try it again. We told the waiter we did not get the right steak that it was not what we ordered and he didn't do anything to make it right. No one attempted to correct the problem and our tab was $146.  Vince Neil's totally disappointed."}
{"text":"We used the Groupon and the food was beyond good. The service was great. Would recommend going"}
{"text":"We had the circus circus coupon for 2 steak dinners and free bottle of wine. The steak was GREAT! Cooked perfectly and for it being well done it was super juicy and not dry at all. Will most definitely come here again to eat. We came on a Wednesday afternoon and it was a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pulled in to Vegas LATE after driving all day from Salt Lake, it was hot and we were exhausted. 

Wanted to take the kids somewhere cool and saw that Vince Neil had a restaurant in Circus Circus! Reviews were mixed but decided to try it SO GLAD WE DID!! We ordered the cajun fish tacos and the shredded pork tacos, both were EXTREMELY good! The drinks were totally cheap, our waitress was a delight and they had a fun DJ and karaoke - the whole experience brought us back to life!

Loved the Motley Crue memorabilia, they even had Tatuado t-shirts that were very reasonably priced. 

Thanks Vince, it was all totally worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Great food, cool decor, great service!  Food was fresh and the staff was friendly.  We had steak burrito and the steak tacos, both of which were excellent.  Only complaint is our drinks were served in plastic."}
{"text":"The food was regular.  Nothing special. Had the burgers. Their Tatuado Lemonade was really good. My daughter had their Krispy Kreme burger and it was too sweet for her so she ate the burger without the donut \"buns\". The atmosphere was nice and so was the staff."}
{"text":"Mostly I think this place gets a bad wrap. Our waiter was great very attentive. My husband ordered the steak and it was delicious. He didn't even use steak sauce. There was Motley Crue music but the guy was a singer in the band so what else would you expect. I had the chicken club and it was also very good. Lots of kids but it's circus circus outside the adventuredome. The margaritas were average. Would go here again but not late because they have a loud dj and karaoke. Unless you like that stuff."}
{"text":"Got the Groupon deal awesome atmosphere!!! The service was not the greatest sat at the table for about 10 min before we were helped the manager lady walked by several times didn't stop once!!  I think the biggest let down of this place was the low volume of music!!! Awesome memorabilia and TV on the wall playing videos bit no sound!!!"}
{"text":"The Groupon for this place was well worth it. The Steak, fries & vegetables, though seemed like not, were perfect. Flavor and portions were great as well as the wine(s). Ended up leaving very satisfied and full! The ambiance was great too!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon and I have to say the steak was perfect and veggies were great. Bottle of wine was good and large price of Cheese cake at the end was yummmy. But our server Joy was just a love and she was perfect. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"After settling into our room at Circus Circus, the hubby and I agreed somewhere nearby for dinner would be best with our two toddlers.

Vince Neil's Tatuado seemed promising. This large restaurant is not terribly far from the West Tower where we were especially considering the ultra fast elevators.

On a Sunday evening, this place is not crowded at all.

A single guy with limited karaoke experience decided to sing just before we left. A country song no less. A Brooks & Dunn hit at that. Very strange choice if you saw this man. How I wish my ears could unhear it all. But one of our daughters is just like her grandmother and we end up waiting for her for everything. The Fart Around Queen, we call her. So of course we had to stay and listen to him then con her out of there by mentioning the Midway (arcade and circus acts) a floor above us.

FOOD
- Bloody Mary ($9.75) was different. It had a fair amount of alcohol, but there was too much of something in it and I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Not my fav.
- Iceberg Wedge Salad ($10.99) - very fresh. Good amount of bleu cheese dressing. But it wasn't just a wedge - it was the whole head of iceberg lettuce. Ha! Topped with diced tomatoes and bacon bits.

SERVICE
I was a bit disappointed that our server, Martha, did not automatically know the soup of the day. Service was good other than that.

ENVIRONMENT
The place could use a deep cleaning and some repairs (like our booth was off-kilter and a sharp edge was revealed). There is a nice large bar. Tables and booth seating. A separate nicer booth for Vince Neil and his entourage. And as alluded to earlier, karaoke.

PRICE
Look, I'm grateful they even have a kid's menu, but $7.99 per entrée plus an additional $2.95 for fountain drinks was a bit steep. Then my husband had a $15.98 bacon cheeseburger. He didn't comment on it so that usually indicates that it was a regular run-of-the-mill burger.

Overall, it's decent if you have a family to re-energize and don't want to wait very long on a Sunday night.

{"text":"Got a coupon when we checked into Circus Circus which scared me.. this hotel really needs to clean up it's hotels entrance.. However the food was really good, had the steak and eggs toast and potatoes cooked perfectly.."}
{"text":"I bet Vince Neil doesn't eat here. This place is as bad as the casino it's in. Hostess was nice and that's about it. Service was horrible, he played hide and seek through our horrible experience.  I asked him about if the bartender can make me a drink not on their horrible alcohol list and he went so far in left field that I was embarrassed of what came out of his mouth. I'd ask if they can make a Mojito and he said he thinks he can, that's made with Orange juice right? He say's and I was like, are you kidding me? No it doesn't. So he said he was going to ask the bartender after he took the rest of our parties drink and I over heard him asking the bartender if he can make a Mojito and it looked by his face that he was being spoke in a foreign language he couldn't understand, then said I don't know how to.  Well my friend, I can see you probably won't move up from this place not knowing a generic drink as the Mojito is. 
Well enough of that horrible scene to the food; the food was overcooked and was just horrible. We had the chicken burrito which was prepared to make you sick. Our party also ordered three burgers, which were overcooked and bad.  Then finally we had fried chicken and that was actually decent.  But Vince Neil needs to get kicked in his balls for this horrible restaurant and not giving a crap about his restaurant."}
{"text":"Perhaps I set my expectations a bit too high for Vegas hotel eateries, or perhaps this place just sucks. A friend and I were visiting Vegas and staying at the Circus Circus hotel when our dinner plans suddenly cancelled. Hungry and tired of searching, we settled on just eating at the hotel. First, there was live music, which is to be expected at a Motley Crue restaurant. What was not to be expected was a man in leather chaps and a cowboy hat belting out country music. I'm sure many patrons would love this setup, however, my friend and I despise country music, so this was equivalent to sitting right at the gates of hell. Seeing as it was pretty late, we anticipated we wouldn't be there long so we stuck it out. I got the Mac and cheese, which took waaaaay too long to come out. We waited a while for the server to even come to the table so we were able to order immediately when he first arrived, then waited an additional 45 minutes for our food. The bacon in the Mac and cheese was way too salty, the plate was hot as if it were just thrown in the microwave, and the cheese looked like it had been sitting out a while. Not appetizing at all. We had a total of three encounters with the server: once to order, when he brought our food, and when we asked for the check. 
In summary: long waits, terrible atmosphere, sub par service, and disgusting food."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a one star, and it would really get half a star if I had an option to do that! Why: because the food was grossly deplorable!!! The service was OK.
We went last night prior to fright dome and all I can say is that I make better food at home! That is not good! 
We ordered a large 6 to 8 person appetizer platter that was supposed to be loaded with nachos, quesadillas, a spinach dip with chips, mozzarella sticks, barbecue spareribs, and a few other items. The platter came and it was loaded with all of these things, all of which tasted like food that was taken from a package from the freezer that was bought at Albertson's! To add to that,it also tasted like that same food was leftovers from another party. It was disgusting and we only touched 10% of it. The platter cost $40 and we all agreed that we threw $40 down the drain. 
The drinks were average but that is not what we came here. We were literally hungry and we left hungry!
Simply put, we are not even going to try to go back here again. This place needs to have new management or a better chef or something. Hands-down, one of the five worst 'restaurants' I have been to in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious, but a little pricey.
The avocado burger was perfectly cooked, the bacon, crispy and the bun was just the right size, not too big and the fries... superb!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon and it was pretty good. 4 steaks and 2 bottles of wine (barefoot wine). It really wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Great burger!! One of the best that I ever had!! Juicy and flavorful.
I chose the regular burger with avocado on top, waiting wasnt so bad, like 7-10 minutes, the place wasnt busy and started filling up. Must say I enjoyed every bite.
Why 4? Well... service, 
It wasn't terrible, I think they changed shifts (or tables) right after I ordered, cause the second waitress did not stop asking \"everything is ok hun?\", I just got the plate and she asked me how is the burger (hun), after second bite-again, than again, at least 8-9 times! Yes I started counting... let me eat! I get if you ask once, maybe you wasn't sure so twice, but every time she walked next to my table- same story! I felt like I must leave...
So yes, dont miss out on this burger, but my advice- take it to go..."}
{"text":"We had the Groupon for 2 steak dinners wirh a bottle of wime and  cheesecake. It's inside of circus circus hotel ,which is a complete dump.The restaurant itself was casual but looked like a rocker spot.Our food was really good ,rhose fries that came with the steak were fantastic. The cheesecake was excellent. Service waa great ."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Overpriced like everything else. Expected better since I live Motley Crue. Good took forever too. Slllllllooooowwwww. Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Nastiest salmon I've ever had Denny's has better salmon I spend 30.30 on a piece of salmon that took an hour to make Nd some nasty rice Nd veggies with water waiter cane around the table once no refill"}
{"text":"Great memorabilia all over the restaurant. True Crue fans dream. We didn't eat. Cool spot."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, service wasn't so great, I was able to order alcohol beverage without any I.D check, maybe the people just don't care or maybe someone had a bad day SMH"}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of this place!  Casual, fun, good food, good service, free karaoke (at least the night we were there).  Totally a blast.  This isn't gourmet restaurant food or anything but food is pretty good if you are just into corner burger restaurant style food.  We will return when in the area again."}
{"text":"The food here was average nothing special out waitress was slow like a lot of waitresses in vegas is seems like. The real problem here is my boyfriend left his card on the table after we paid the bill. He came back to the restaurant and asked if they saw it and they said no and the waitress said no. They said if they found it they would turn it into security. So security didn't have it and my boyfriend called to cancel his card because maybe he though he dropped it somewhere else. The next day the hotel lobby calls saying the restaurant had his card! Seriously so annoying having to deal with canceling a card and getting more funds when they had the card the whole time! Just don't go here these people are lazy."}
{"text":"Underestimated the steak. I must say it was AMAZING. Will do again. Their cheesecake is to die for, not kidding when she said you'll taste the difference."}
{"text":"For fans of Vince Neil's like myself this is awesome.  There is Vince Neil and Motley Crue memrobilia all over.  Plus on Thursday's you can sing karaoke with a real rock band- rock-a-roke! Very awesome.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I will have to give 1 star particularly to this waitress named Susana!!! She is so rude to us. She is hispanic with thick accent with a Farrah Fawcett type of hair  and she answered our question very rudely. She is RUDE!!! With exclamation point! I need the manager to pay attention to this review as i bet you do not want to lose customers in the future. I need the management of this restaurant to respond to this review because a restaurant gets more of their reputation not only of the dishes they serve but how the servers treat their customers/"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place five stars, I really would love to. 
Our food was really tasty, I loved the mixed veggies and they cooked my steak to perfection!!

The atmosphere is awesome and could really be a great place if they hired new staff!! The manager clearly doesn't have standards for his staff. All the waiters and waitresses have awful attitudes. One waitress was ticked off and threw the menus right near us. 
Our waitress was just as awful and rude.  We eat out a lot and this was the worst service ever.  
Her attitude wasn't professional or pleasant at all.

The only employee that we did encounter that was nice and friendly was the hostess and she is actually the person that brought our food out to us. 
Maybe the the manager might think about moving her to the floor to wait tables, she was the only person that asked if we were doing well, asked if we needed anything else and legitimately cared. I wished they wore name tags or even introduced themselves so I could name drop. I can say we came for lunch on Saturday around noonish. 

If this establishment failed I will tell you right now it's because of the awful staffing.  
I'd like to see this place getting more stars because it is a fun atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Wow! Can't believe I see 3 stars as a rating for this place. This was probably the worst place I've been to in a long time.  The moment we walked in, to the moment we left. This place is horrible.  The hostess was not to be found, and when she did make an appearance, she walked away and said she was on break. The waiter was ok, but it did t make up for the horrible food. The nachos were just plain nasty.  All the toppings for them were straight out of a can. Sorry, but this place doesn't deserve to be open. Either get a new staff, menu, mgt...or just close it down."}
{"text":"We decided to try Vince Neils, not only because we're 80s hair band freaks, but also because there as a great Groupon and it sounded like fun.  The restaurant is in Circus Circus and I wasn't thrilled with that casino.  However, the restaurant itself was generally inviting.  The food was average, the staff response was slow.  It was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  The most fun part of the experience was that it was the World Finals of Karaoke.  That was fun and very entertaining.  I was overall happy we tried it because I love new things, but I have had better service, food and experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time. The wings are the best in Las Vegas.  Great drinks and the music and videos were perfect.  Ask for Sophia to be you're bartender.  She was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible service. Went there last night and waited 10 minutes before we were even greeted at the front. Food was average and overpriced. That was my first time going there.
We had a coupon for a steak dinner for two so i went back tonight and we were seated right away. We sat there for 10 minutes and not one server came over and helped us with drinks or even introduced themselves. I wasn't going to sit and wait after that so we left as another employee watched us leave without asking if we've been helped or at least trying to keep us there. I will not go back there again. Food isn't that good, service is terrible. Sad because the place looks really cool and it could be a nice restaurant but it is neglected in many areas..."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon for a steak dinner for two and a bottle of wine.  Excellent value.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere was lively and fun.  We ate well, sang a song on the karaoke stage and got buzzed on wine.  Overall, we had a good time."}
{"text":"Eat Drink Party wasn't my first restaurant choice. However, when it's NYE and you don't have reservations or feel like braving through the crowds along the strip, this was the best option in Circus Circus. There was no wait and the restaurant wasn't even half full. I was surprised to see so many kids eating there, but then again, it is inside of Circus Circus. Food was average, but service was surprisingly good. They had a DJ on stage, but he was somewhat awkward. 

Started with the firecracker wings. Given the name, I assumed these would be spicy. Maybe we received BBQ by mistake because these had no kick to them at all. On the bright side, they were fried nicely. For my entree, I had the grilled chicken and avocado burger. The chicken had a lot of flavor, the bacon was crispy, and there was a generous amount of avocado and pico de gallo. However, I found my burger to be just okay. I did really enjoy the cheddar jalapeno bun, though. The side of fries were plentiful, but again, just okay.

Service was excellent, with our waitress being very accommodating throughout our meal. With so many options along the Strip, not sure I'd make it back here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon. From the outside you could barely tell the place was open. Got seated right away since the place was about 10% full. Waited for 5 minutes but no waiter showed up at our table. We watched a couple of other waiters run around while we noticed people at other tables looking hungry and irritated at the lack of service. We got out of there soon after. By the way the hostess said \"I'm sorry\" you could tell that people walk away all the time.  The stuff on the walls were just regular old guitars. No pictures that you couldn't just see on the Internet or in a magazine. Can't tell you about the quality of the food or the portions, but the prices were standard Vegas rip-off overpriced rates. DON'T BLAME ME if you go there and it sucks because I warned you about this place! (I wish I could give it LESS then 1 star)"}
{"text":"I would like to say that we have been regular customers at Vince Neil's restaurant for the past five years well sadly to say that will now and we've had to really bad experiences this past week we waited over five minutes for somebody to even approach the table to offer you a drink and I told the manager what happened and he said are you serious and I said I'm dead serious OK A dinner service we waited over 45 minutes for our food the salad chicken was cold as it was dead as a door nail and dry the turkey burger was burnt completely. I would not recommend eating at this location circus circus should buy them out of their contract and have their own restaurant"}
{"text":"Ok so my boyfriend bought a Groupon deal for this place...for $39.00 you get dinner for two which includes 2 8oz steaks with fries and vegetables, a bottle of wine, and a huge piece of cheesecake. We didn't know what to expect since we read the reviews beforehand and it seemed about 50/50. Lots of complaints about the food and the service. We were seated right away and greeted by a friendly server. We mentioned the Groupon and she seemed to be ok with it (other reviews said the servers were rude when mentioning the Groupon). Also the general manager walked around and greeted us and made sure we were good. We got our food right away and it wasn't too bad. I ordered my steak medium rare and got medium but I was ok with this. The food was good...would I pay full price for this dinner, no, but for the price it was worth it. Both the boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised with this place considering the not so good reviews. Would we return here again? Maybe if we had another Groupon."}
{"text":"I was hesitant, but glad I took the chance.

I was promptly seated by Raven; a fairly new server who was on top of her game from moment one!! 

Vince Neil ... what's he know about food?  Probably not much, but this place is pretty cool, a free museum of sorts.  The $7.77 special was a hit for me, pancakes, eggs and bacon, with coffee.  Best breakfast for the price.

If you go, ask for Raven, she's very friendly and a great waitress/server!"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon for 2 Strips, bottle of wine, and Cheesecake to share. Steak was very good! Service was excellent. Even though some folks think Circus Circus is a downgrade, do yourself a favor and keep you nose in joint and try this place! I would return again!"}
{"text":"I used a Groupon at this place for a steak dinner for two. The steaks were well seasoned. The flavor of the sides and steaks are quite decent! I only took one star off because there was no upgrade option on the wine. The manager should let customers upgrade the wine when the customers were willing to pay more! The service was good. She did give us the option to substitute the cheap wine with cocktails. :) Overall, I'm happy with the diner."}
{"text":"This place was just not clean. Everything was sticky, like someone spilled a Sprite and never cleaned it up. Over priced burgers that were nothing out of the ordinary. Napkins and silverware were not provided unless asked for, and then I was only given one set for our party of three. 
This restaurant was in the Circus Circus Casino which was a flat out dump. If I only had a time machine to take me back to the 70's I could maybe see when this place was relevant. 
If you don't mind mingling with the junkies and homeless, then this is the place for you. 
Families beware."}
{"text":"Once again we went over there friendly service even the steak was cook a little over a was nice and tasty just the portions of the side a little smaller than last time our server I think his name was Tim Asian person he opened the bottle of wine properly will be back by the way right in front of the stage area you can smell the smoke from the  the casino"}
{"text":"They seemed to be understaffed which is a shame because it was the start of spring break season when we were here. Had to wait a while for any service. Once we got a waiter, he was fantastic and made sure we were happy with everything. But the only time we saw him were for drink orders, food orders, the \"check in\" after food arrived, and for the check.
The food itself was good. Ma's Mac & Cheese is amazing! Highly recommend if you like creamy Mac and cheese. The BBQ bacon burger was good but needed more BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Besides the location of circus circus. This is a really great place to eat, the burger was amazing, upgrade fries for a buck. Went twice during the same weekend. I was staying in the building. Will definitely go back again. And they have a 7 day karaoke thing going on."}
{"text":"The service is slow and as you can see by the Salt and pepper shakers the employees don't take pride in what they do.  

Now for the food the burgers are fantastic.."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. There is so much better food, ambiance and service elsewhere in Las Vegas.

This was my and my husband's first trip to Las Vegas, and after the flight, shuttle ride and check-in process we were ready to eat. So we saw a sign in the casino for this place and thought burgers and beers sounded perfect. I still think they would have been great. Just not here.

We were seated in the unhappiest waitress' section and were alternately ignored or snapped at the entire meal. I don't normally rate service because my idea of good service and your idea of good service might be very different. But this was flat out BAD service.

I ordered a burger stacked with mac and cheese, (sounds decadent right?!) and my husband a chicken and avocado burger/sandwich. The only thing worth mentioning are the fries that came with the sandwiches. They were crisp and an unusual take on waffle fries. Both of our sandwiches lacked flavor. His sandwich had no sauce of any variety on it and my burger hadn't been seasoned. And let's not talk about beer prices. For that price my beer better arrive ice cold and promptly. Neither happened.

Eat somewhere else. This place is worth skipping for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered room service, we got the 12 piece chicken bucket...let me just say that i like very fried chicken, but this chicken was beyond that i would say almost burnt, the mash wasnt really mash its basically a baked potato that they tore apart, the gravy was clunky and no flavor.. the only thing that was good was the slaw i must say thats the only reason i gave it 2 stars ,sodas run u about $3 and it took an hour to deliver and we r just upstairs plus we didn't get any straws....overall spend ur money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the steak was so tough! It had great flavor and was prepared correctly but I spit out more than I ate! We had sirloin with mash potatoes which were delicious and the ribs and fries...those were good. It did seem to take a while for us to get our food being that it wasn't busy. The waiters were friendly and DJ Miguel was great keeping the audience interacting with the karaoke singers. The restaurant is mostly family friendly however music videos are playing constantly and there were some really provocative that some parents may feel uncomfortable exposing their children to.#RoadtripUSA"}
{"text":"I went here with low expectations based on reviews, but I found myself pleasantly surprised.  I got their signature burger shown on all the posters, and it was pretty good.  Service was fast too.  This is the best restaurant at Circus Circus with the exception of The Steak House (which is about as pricey as a Ruth's Chris)."}
{"text":"The entire circus circus casino is in need of cleaning.    There is no pride in the employees.   Dirty uniforms hygiene and facilities.   Comps are non existent and the general feeling is that nobody cares.  Hesitate to even give one star"}
{"text":"I was deeply disappointed. I'm shocked Vince Neil would allow his name to be on here. Several drinks were not offered that were on the menu. No IPA. And the house wine was one step above Mad Dog 20/20. Service was disappointing and it wasn't even busy. And what restaraunt /bar on the strip doesnt have Bacardi???"}
{"text":"One of the only places open for a late lunch at Circus Circus, as the buffet closes at 2pm and the pizzeria's line is very long.  The food offerings are generally American - burgers, salads, sandwiches, and there are a few Mexican options (tacos and burritos).  I had the shrimp tacos and I recommend it.  A tad spicy, as there are pieces of jalapenos or peppers hiding under the cabbage and salsa.  There is a fair amount of shrimp in each taco, not just two pieces.  The sauce is zesty, so additional sauce isn't necessary. You get three in an order.  I also tried some of my bf's avocado cheeseburger - juicy and huge.  Those fries are something else!  I'm not sure what it is, but the coating, shape and crunch are not like typical French fries (they kind of remind me of churros - they are dark and shaped more round with sharp edges than square).

This place is loud, with TVs playing music videos from the past, which is kind of neat (you don't see 80's or 90's music videos at restaurants many places nowadays) and nostalgic.  Decor here is Motley Crue instruments, awards and wardrobes, so that's the theme - hair/rock bands.  It looks like there is a stage in the center of the restaurant, so I assume a band or DJ plays/spins on weekend evenings.  Staff is friendly and quick to seat you.  Food is ready fairly quickly and our server, Windy, was attentive to our table."}
