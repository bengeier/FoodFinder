{"text":"Very good meal, atmosphere, and service.  Very easy and ample parking. Had no reservation. Went on a Saturday at 530ish and seated without problem. If I were to go later I think reservations are a good idea. They were still decorated for Christmas but wow was it gorgeous. Waitress was nice and fast.  Stuffed mushroom appetizer was good. 4 caps with crab/bread stuffing. Very good quality.  Bread was delicious and warm, butter whipped and easy to spread.  Salad was normal/average.  Wedding soup was delicious.  Wife had Veal Maryland which was 4 veal medalions and super lump crab in a white sauce, excellent; a twice baked potato too which was average.  I had the larger cut of prime rib, rare, and smashed redskin potatoes.  Best prime rib I've had in a long time.  It was huge and almost 2in thick!  They did a nice job.  Potatoes were good and very buttery.  Service was good.  Several waiters picked up our plates and packaged our leftovers.  Never an empty glass.  Restrooms were clean.  I will definitely be back.  Total with tip was $90 and very worth it. This is really a great place!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years, but it was just as good as I remembered. Prime rib on a Sunday night and cooked perfectly for me. I like it rare and it was. My daughter had the crab cakes which were good sized and she liked them. We will go again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Grossly over-priced, and they \"lost\" my meal when they brought my wife's out, after we waited 45 min. One free draft of Iron City was the managers apology. Yeah I think for the price we'll go somewhere nice from now on..."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this place after purchasing a grouping a few months ago. Nice quiet romantic atmosphere, gorgeous ceiling, low lights, and fireplace. From the outside you'd think it was a dive bar next to a tanning place but don't judge a book yada yada. The menu is amazing. Huge, varied, and gourmet. Tasted just as amazing as you would guess from the descriptions. About 20 a meal for dinner per person. Id have given it 5 stars but we went at 3:30 and there was only one other two top in the restaurant and we were still there until 5, so plan for a leisurely meal; though I did notice they do take out as well."}
{"text":"Was here with friends for Happy Hour. We sat at the bar and had appetizers & drinks. Upon leaving we received our check from the bartender. I noticed I was being over charged for an extra mixed drink for my wife & an extra beer for myself. I questioned the bartender & she yelled out \"I do not make mistakes\" so everyone in the bar could hear. She was insulted that I was questioning my bill. As a customer I have a right to question! The bartender made a big  hubbla causing an argument with me. So she got $6.50 out of the drawer & slammed it down on the counter & told our party to leave & don't come back. DON'T WORRY We WON'T!!! They care less about customers!"}
{"text":"took my wife for her birthday meal. she ordered the surf and turf, I the prime rib. when her meal arrived it was too beautiful to eat. (she did eat it) the lobster tail was south African, the biggest tail I've ever seen. cooked to perfection also a beautiful filet. my prime rib was the best I've ever eaten. the waitress was excellent and Linda the bartender makes the best Cosmos in the world. Thee Olde Place is the best kept secret in Pgh!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch options and atmosphere.  Portions are generous.  The waitress was very helpful explaining the menu (I think Lori?). We will be back."}
{"text":"This place looks like a bar from the outside.  Let me tell you it is nothing like a bar at all.  Probably the best secret in the South Hills. This place can be whatever you want it to be. Stars on the ceiling give it a romantic feel, but the cozy bar gives it a casual feel also.  So whether it's a lobster tail and a steak for your anniversary or a burger and fries after a game, they got you covered. Great service and kitchen guaranteed open until 10pm.  I would give some examples but I eat here weekly without a bad experience. Everything is good. 4 lunch special and 4 dinner specials change daily. Get anyone and you will be happy. If I had to give you my go to item I would have to say the Prime Rib for dinner and the French Dip and Wedding soup for lunch. Appetizer is either Fried Zucchini or the baked Artichokes.  Sunday Brunch is so good I can't even explain in words. If I had to say a negative I would have to say it can be a little pricey at times, but the quality overshadows this. There are plenty of chain restaurants charging the same for frozen dinners. Give it a shot!! You will running back the following week. Promise."}
{"text":"Cool place. The Christmas decor is beautiful. The service is typically friendly, attentive, and efficient. They have lots of different options. The stuffed banana peppers are delicious, as is the chicken and peppers. The salads are big and tasty. Greens and beans is a delicious appetizer, and the wedding soup is a good starter. One thing I don't like is the chicken Romano. Very overly buttery and creamy, doesn't really taste like authentic chicken Romano At all."}
{"text":"Delicious food option right by the Allegheny County Airport. I flew in with my wife and sister this past Sunday and we grabbed a quick lunch around 2pm. Although the restaurant looks dated from the outside, the interior is quite nice. There were a lot of locals seated at the bar. We weren't immediately welcomed by a hostess, but eventually found our way to take a seat with no issues.

I ordered a french onion soup which was DELICIOUS. There was a fried onion ring inside it and the melted cheese was nice and gooey while the broth was hearty, sweet and salty. I had the special burger, while my wife had an open face steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions. My burger was A-OK, pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. The meat wasn't cooked evenly to order, but I get that it can be pretty hard to do that.

Service was fine throughout the experience and the coffee they had was tasty. Our meal came to be about $50 for 3-people for lunch."}
{"text":"The food at this place is top quality.  It is pricy, but everything I have had here has always been cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  My favorite meal here are the crab cakes.  Good crab cakes are tough to find around here, but these are the best I have had in the Pittsburgh area.

My only knock on the place is that it could use some upgrades to make it feel a little more modern.  They do tend to cater to an older crowd and I guess it is part of their draw, but the place seems a little outdated."}
{"text":"I just got back from dinner with my family at the old place and I can't emphasize enough my disappointment. The service was poor. Our waitress was a nice gal who was working hard, she simply had too many tables because the place was woefully understaffed. Our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and she was usually too busy to check on us. I had to go and find her a few times to get things that were missed. 

I don't mind paying the high prices of the old place if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was a let down. Four of us ordered the French onion soup. The soup was so salty it was rendered uneatable. The steak was good, but the baked potato was so dry I thought it left over from lunch. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite bland. Everything else we ordered was just ok. To sum it up, our meal was mediocre at best and we were all disappointed. Not one person on our party of seven really enjoyed their meal. 

I express my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she informed me that she would write my complaints in a book they kept. That was it. I left with the feeling that they were happy that they got my money and that they did not really care that my family's dinner was poor. They made no effort to make it right and they made no effect to ease my displeasure. 

This will be my last family dinner at the old place. I will take my business to a place that has better food and a place that values it's customers."}
{"text":"Some Pittsburgh restaurants seem to follow a similar path,  with initial enthusiasm, good food, then not quite so good, and then a new cook, or new owner (owing to the death of an owner, etc.) and an effort to make as much money as possible in a short time. TOPI has, lamentably, denigrated to the phase encountered just before the doors are shuttered permanently. We had a delightful party of family members champing at the bit to visit a heretofore sterling dining establishment. Its been about a year since we last ate there, and oh my, what a disappointment. From soup, to salad, to entr√©e, nothing was up to par. For the prices you pay, you expect a great meal. My selection was New York Strip and a baked potato. I was served a piece of flank steak barely a half inch thick, and a potato that was surely baked--into a dried out piece of cardboard. The bottom of the potato was burned to a crisp, inside and out.

Service was mediocre, and several of our party had to remind the wait staff that sides were missing. Even the wine tasted more like Reunite Red than the Cabernet Sauvignon I requested. All of our soups were returned, as they were not much more than a flavored salt lick one might put out for deer. One of our party ordered garlic mashed redskin potatoes, but received some sort of cheddar cheese/mash potato concoction that no one could stomach. 

I'm afraid my days of dining at Thee Olde Place Inn are finished. There is far too much competition in the South Hills to justify returning there. If you read other reviews, and look at the time line, I very likely would agree with those reviews. I'm uncertain why the awful turn for the worse, but I'll be spending my money elsewhere in the future. Indeed, we have a dinner party planned for 20 folks next week, and after this fiasco, there's not a prayer of me subjecting friends to poor food, bad wine, and slow service. The only thing that happened quickly was the check. Now, that, the staff was quick to process."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years, and have normally enjoyed the food,  but service has always been poor.   We live out of town and since my Mom still loves it here we thought we would take her here for Mother's Day.  I called and made a reservation and they NEVER mentioned it was a buffet at $26.95 per person.   We were absolutely stunned when we arrived and found out that's what we would be eating and at such a ridiculous price.    Not wanting to create a scene, we just sat down.   My mother has celiac disease and can't eat gluten but the server assured us there would be things for her to eat.   That was the one and only time we saw our server for the entire meal, and yet there was a mandatory 15% gratuity on our bill which was RIDICULOUS!!!!!!   She never checked on us, offered us more drink and we had to track her down for the bill.

Although there was a variety of food, and we were second in line to eat at 3:30, all the food, with the exception of the scalloped potatoes was cold.  SUPER DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!   They should be appalled that this is what they served and at that price.  As far as gluten free food, she ate the prime rib, turkey and ham.  The smashed red potatoes were awful and everything else was covered with bread crumbs.  She couldn't eat 85% of the food, so the server lied.   My husband wanted to make a fuss but I didn't want to upset my Mom so he let it go.

This was my last time to eat here.   I feel so ripped off and annoyed that I can't justify ever going back."}
{"text":"The old saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" applies to this place. I was trying to find a place to eat and decided to check out this place since it was close. By the name and location I made some assumptions about the restaurant. I thought it was going to be a pub type environment with pub type food. I was half right. It is a pub environment. The menu, however was not pub food. The entrees started at $20. So instead of burgers we had porkchops, steak salad, and chicken. 
When you walk in you walk right into the bar which takes up almost the whole bar side of the restaurant. You walk around the bar to the place to be seated in the dining area which has 6 tables. It is very dark because the ceiling tiles are painted black with Christmas lights poked through. There are cloth table clothes which should have been the giveaway that this was not pub food. 
We ordered drinks. I am not a tea connoisseur but the tea was awful. It was from a bar tap or mixed out of a can in the back. It was not fresh brewed. My meal started off with the salad. It was covered in red onion. Big chunks and thin slices. There were 2 black olives, a tablespoon of shredded carrots, and a big portion of iceberg lettuce. I had asked for it not to have tomatoes. I asked for Bleu Cheese dressing. It was as thin as water. It had hardly any taste. One of the people with me got wedding soup that was very delicious. 
I ordered a dish I hadn't heard of before called Chicken Martini. It was chicken medallions breaded with Parmesan cheese that were cooked until golden on the stove and then baked in the oven. The chicken was a golden brown with a white cream type sauce over it. The chicken was tender but it tasted like you were eating a mouth full of cheese. I love cheese but this was too much. I used a lemon wedge from my tea to squeeze on the chicken to give it a brightness. 
I tried the pork chops and they were cooked perfectly. If you go I would highly recommend them. The steak on the steak salad was also nicely done and there was a lot of it. It also came with some very tasty garlic bread. 
We were definitely the youngest diners in the restaurant by at least 10 years. It made me want to call the guy, Robert, who does the restaurant makeovers. He would take it from the dark place that it is and bring the decor into 2016. They would draw a younger crowd. You need younger diners for when the seniors aren't able to dine out anymore. They have a good menu and most of the food is good. Sometimes you sacrifice environment for food. This was one of those times."}
{"text":"My mother-in law likes the restaurant and so my wife and I take her there at least twice a year. If I never returned to the restaurant again, I would be fine with that. 

Typically we dine here during the early dinner hour on a weekday to avoid the busy time. In theory, this strategy would result in more attentive service and avoid any sold out entries. Past experience has shown that this theory does not hold up.

However, in this instance, we decided to take my mother-in-law there for Mother's Day. We made the earliest possible reservation (3:30pm). When we arrived at the restaurant we learned that they were serving a buffet. We dislike buffets and my mother-in-law has a gluten allergy. Had we been informed of this when we called for the reservation we would have gone elsewhere.

Absolutely every entree (pasta, salmon, beef, turkey and ham was lukewarm at best. The only hot item wax the scalloped potatoes! This is amazing in that we were the first in line when the buffet opened! 

After taking our drink order, our server did not once stop at our table to ask how we were doing. For those familiar with the dining area situated by the bar, you know that a server would practically have to go out of their way to avoid us! We had to ask the bus person anytime we needed something, until it was time for the check.

We paid $27 a person for a buffet serving lukewarm food and horrible service. I was planning to provide a gratuity that reflected the poor service, only to find that 15% was automatically added to our check! On top of this, the credit card slip was presented with a line suggesting a gratuity, with no mention that the bill had already included the 15%!! I wonder how many people were tricked by this deceitful act?

NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Did dinner tonight at Thee Olde Place Inn.  It wasn't too crowded and I got waited on rather promptly.  I looked over the specials and was torn between the Stuffed Chicken Breast and the Stuffed Cod but decided on the chicken. 

The chicken breast came in about 15 minutes.  A huge helping of red skinned mashed potatoes, crispy (probably steamed) serving of broccoli, and a slab of chicken under stuffing... the potatoes, stuffing and chicken was smothered in gravy.  A most delicious meal for only $16.61 (including a beer but not the tip). 

I give it a thumbs up and four stars.  The atmosphere here is quaint, the service is friendly and the food quality is very good.  I only wish they had a better selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today with a buddy for lunch - at his recommendation - after a round of golf nearby. Really glad we did, because the food was terrific!
The place is out of the way, tucked away where I'd have never looked. The building is conjoined with a tanning salon, a trophy shop or something...but there's ample parking, and one great reason to find it. The food!
I ordered a roast beef platter with their smashed potatoes and gravy. My buddy had a salad with grilled chicken. 
Holy portions! Holy great taste! The food was excellent (super potatoes - wow!) and the very attentive server was icing on the cake. Courteous and johnny on the spot! 
Oh yeah...big thumbs up for this little hideaway gem...and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Long had I wondered what could be found along Streets Run Road in the South Hills, passing the intersection between it and Clairton Boulevard countless times throughout my life. When I found out about a restaurant located on that stretch of asphalt that was heralded as a well-kept secret, I knew I had a quest to complete. 

Located on a byway that would fool anyone into thinking they'd driven off to a distant rural area, Thee Olde Place Inn has a time-worn regality to it both inside and out. A coat-of-arms serves as its insignia. The door, framed by a wall of stone, looks like it came from a Scottish castle. The ceiling of the interiors are cleverly lit in a way that whimsically evokes a starry night. A grand old fireplace can be found somewhere in middle the house. My immediate impression was that TOPI is either a casual neighborhood pub that is good for a burger and a beer or a romantic supper spot fit for lobster and filet mignon by candlelight depending on what your mood or occasion is. 

A little girl and her large family were celebrating a first communion in the ornate dining room, so Kay and I indulged in an early dinner at the bar. Motown provided the jukebox soundtrack to our meal as the Kentucky Derby played out on the tube and a conversation regarding hockey and proper lawn care took place between two middle-aged regulars. 

My experience was so glowing that I'll ignore the fact that the boneless chicken breast in my Mixed Grill entree was a touch underseasoned and that TOPI's desserts, as moderately appetizing as mine was, come from an outside vendor (our server told us that despite the chef's passion for baking, TOPI is not allowed to bake their own cakes and pies due to some local bureaucratic nonsense that requires the use of a convection oven). Regardless, the flap of poultry was so supple, chewing was almost irrelevant. Completing the dish were ideally executed pieces of grilled New York strip steak and center cut pork chop, the former done medium-rare, the latter done medium. Beyond succulent, both pieces of meat were fragile, charred perfectly, and yielded to knife, fork, and canine with no resistance, making them worthy of the finest steakhouses sans reservations and formal attire. Hidden slyly beneath the proteins were a juicy tomato slice and a heap of fried onion strings. 

Accompanying the main course was a golden helping of buttery smashed redskin potatoes that warmed my stomach and heart with starchy, comforting flavors. 

An invigoratingly fresh salad dressed with a pungent, housemade Italian vinaigrette served as the palate-renewing prelude to the highlight of the meal: The Crab Au Gratin appetizer. 

Served in a crock with magnificently toasted pita triangles that were tasty enough to be eaten plain, the breadcrumb-topped dip itself contained a broiled orange-colored fondue loaded with jumbo lump crabmeat, smoked bacon, and beer cheese.  Hedonistic in flavor and texture, each chewy, mildly crispy wedge of bread served as but a vessel for the melted, smelted, gloriously gloppy spread. After running out of pita canapes, we used our dinner rolls to sop up the remainder of the au gratin, not wanting to waste one smudge of this amazingly tempting starter. 

Our server, whose name escapes me, was affable, attentive, and never kept us waiting long for anything, honoring any and all special requests without griping and talking us up as if we were recurring customers. 

There's a beauty to the clandestine nature of certain institutions that reside in Pittsburgh's southern suburbs, so much so, that I almost feel as if I'm ruining them for everyone simply by reviewing them. Although, come to think of it, why hoard Thee Olde Place Inn's charm for but a few? That would be a crime. 

Get over to Baldwin sometime, and let Chefs Dom and Lulu take care of you.

P.S. The Salted Caramel Cake was just fine for what it was and from where it originated. However, might I suggest that TOPI take on some stovetop desserts that don't require an oven like Cherries Jubilee, Bananas Foster, or Cinnamon Crepes? Or some chilled, no-bake items such as homemade ice cream, chocolate pudding, tiramisu or fruit mousse parfaits? All one needs is a fryer for funnel cake or doughnut holes. Creme Brulee only needs a spell under a broiler. A waffle iron can produce wonderful things as well for obvious reasons. Let's hope they consider their options or are able to cut through the legal red-tape eventually."}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend and son, and we loved it! The ladies were very busy, but it was ok because there were so many delicious dishes to choose from. My 8 month old son loves the ceiling that is lit up like a start sky! Their reislinger  was delicious, the meals even more so!
Thank you to the great server I had, I wish I had got your name!"}
{"text":"I ended up at Thee Olde Place by a total fluke. My husband and I were out and about after Christmas -- We had a great Groupon for a massage at Honor Your Body Wellness [best massage of my life! - https://www.yelp.com/biz/honor-your-body-wellness-pittsburgh?hrid=gRPKLeU9-W0rjVvKV4-AlA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)] -- and, since we live so far away from the spa, we decided to make our local road trip to Baldwin a day date. We were looking for a unique place for lunch - and this is it! 

We live near Bob's Garage, in Fox Chapel, which is known for it's outrageous Christmas decorations; however, we don't go very much anymore because it's a smoking establishment with below average food. Thee Olde Place Inn is now going to be my go-to place for the holidays. It was beautifully (and tastfully) decorated with garland, Nutcrackers, and wreaths. The fireplace kept the smaller dining area near the bar very cozy. And the food! I had one of the best piece of haddock I've had in a while, plus some very tasty from-scratch mac and cheese. My hubby had a fantastic burger and a few beers. 

On a side note, two other cool things I noticed: There was another, huge dining room behind us, as well as a totally enclosed smoking area in the back, which we never smelled at all. Also, the ceiling tiles are covered with these really neat little twinkle lights that change pattern and color every few minutes.

Our bill was reasonable; and, the waitress was super friendly and nice. Don't be discouraged by the underwhelming outside of the building - just walk on it and have an incredible meal. Overall, I'm so glad we found this place - and I hope to find a reason to make the trek back!"}
{"text":"We were in West Mifflin for a week and we ate at this place three times.  The food was good, the service was great.  If you want a drink with your mea this is the place!  They have a big variety on their menu with two different specials every day.  Eat here; you won't be sorry!"}
