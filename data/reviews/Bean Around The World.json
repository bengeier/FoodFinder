{"text":"Nice coffee shop in Markham! The staff there are super friendly. The place is clean and lots of tables for you to sit and relax. I tried their caramel macchiato and banana chocolate chip muffin and they were delicious! Love supporting local cafes."}
{"text":"New coffee place in Markham, yay! Bright, clean and spacious with a modern interior, this cafe is a good place to meet up for a coffee or a meal. There's also free wifi so it's definitely a good alternative to Starbucks! They currently serve coffee, tea, baked goods (cakes, muffins, scones) and hot sandwiches. There's also a Neapolitan pizza menu with a 'Coming Soon' sign on it. Coffee beans and tea leaves are available for sale too looking at the board.   We had a Flat White and an Americano, both were good. Credit to the BEAN espresso roast! The hot Italian baguette was tasty too. We also tried their scones but found it too doughy for our liking.   Will come back for sure to try their other menu items. Perhaps for coffee and dessert after dining in Osaka Sushi right next door!"}
{"text":"Love The Bean - Americano coffee is made perfectly.  Ambiance is very nice, clean and provides a relaxing atmosphere.  The service is always on par.  By far my choice of upper end coffee shops in Markham.  Peter"}
{"text":"Greatest Caf√© in the GTA, hands down! Staff are friendly - as are other customers. Everything they serve, be it: coffees, teas, muffins, sandwiches or pizzas are usually followed by the sentence \"the best I've ever had.\"    Here are some of my recommendations:  Coffee: Hwy 7, Cuban Organic, Italian Teas: Jung Pana, White Needle, Pu' Erh (was aged in a cave for 5 years) Muffins: Apple Cinnamon French Toast, Sweet Corn Sandwiches: Hot Italian, Turkey Cranberry Pizzas: Arugula Mushroom, Prosciutto Margherita"}
{"text":"Love the plave.  Americano is excellent. We tried the Corn muffin and Apple Cinnamon French Toast muffins--loved them.   The Peach Scone was not bad too.  Spacious, perfect for chilling / working.  I look forward to more variety of food items."}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good, got a caramel macchiato and it wasn't too too sweet which is perfect. Atmosphere is really nice, it's a good quiet place to study and the owner is super friendly and helpful with suggestions with coffee and such. They have a couple of larger tables for groups, and a corner that looks like they have live music events which would be cool too."}
{"text":"The coffee was pretty good and the place was spacious. However, there needs to be a better vent system for their kitchen, clothes smelled after sitting there for about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great place to work/study at as there's always an abundance of good sized tables and most importantly, wifi there is fast. Drinks are a bit more expensive compared to other shops though."}
{"text":"Reasonable cappuccino at full bore pricing. It was completely empty on a Tuesday afternoon so service was quick. Decor is big and open but it's corner location means not much sunlight and limited outdoor seating. Not bad for picking up a quick cup of Java but not sure I would hang out."}
{"text":"They added lactose free options. Makes it a 5 star for me.   Previous: 4 stars Went in today and ordered an Americano, it was nice and strong how I like it and also ordered a french toast apple muffin which was really good. The interior is really nice and the menu is extensive. Only thing is that they didn't seem to have lactose free milk and only had soy milk for people who don't take dairy in their drinks, hopefully they add lactose free milk for their coffee options. Other than that I'll be coming here for my coffee and espresso over Starbucks. Read less"}
{"text":"I always saw this place and wondered \"how does a non big chain coffee store survive in this random suburban plaza away from everything else?\" I finally stepped in the other day and realized why. It's homely, the coffee is excellent, and it just seems like a place where you want to stay and hang out and have a few coffees while reading a book. Looks like there's dedicated regulars and it's understandable."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to find a coffee shop that cares so deeply about its product and customers. Wonderful service, knowledgeable and plenty of beverages to choose from."}
{"text":"Got an iced coffee last week on a hot summer day and it was so delicious. The cafe is spacious and barristas was kind. I also ordered the apple french toast muffin and it was equally delicious when I ate it the next day!"}
{"text":"I have heard a few friends' went to this place and I want to try too.  The gentlemen who served me is definitely not a trained barista. Their medium latte consisted of 3 shots and he poured an \"expired\" shot in my cup then queued 2 shots. I don't know how old is that single shot and he thought I didn't see that. Espresso is only good within seconds after it's brewed.  Then he started to prep milk, the milk bag only has 2 drops of milk left and he still tried to get it out. As a food handler, they should know opening a new bag would avoid cross contamination.  I only sipped once to try the coffee then I tossed the whole cup to avoid getting sick."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon to get some work done.  It's a nice little boutique cafe that has your typical caffeinated drinks, baked goods and also pizza! They also have a large selection of loose leaf tea that you can either buy in bulk or as a single cup.  The person who I assume is the owner was introducing some of their reaction selections to me.  Very informative and you can see that he's passionate about it.  At one point during my visit, he even came by the table to see how I was doing and asked if I needed anything.  The latte I got was good.  No fancy latte art or anything, but it was a good drink!  There's small area near the front od the cafe dedicated for live bands, so I have a feeling this place gets lively at night.  To end, great service, great drinks and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Really liked the comfortable environment here. Enjoyed my short stay here (it was operating on holiday hours and closed at 4pm). Great vibe and a variety of seating was available. Definitely liked the spaciousness of this coffee place!  Food/Coffee: Tried Americano Misto for the first time - it's espresso and water topped with steamed milk. Personally for me, I prefer espresso (in Italy), latte anywhere, and coffee when I just need that coffee - and even $1 iced coffee at MCD with milk only and no sugar, no cream works just as well!   Ordered a Ham & Swiss Cheese panini. Their bread was really good! Appreciated the barista asking me if I wanted it warmed up. Absolutely! This was good. I kinda wished it came with a side salad though! It's more of a snack size than meal size.  Service: Great! Super nice and friendly and I think for the ambiance and service, it would be the winning points of why I would come back.  Overall Experience: I like their overall selection if drinks and would love to try their Oolong Milk Tea next. Oh and their Oreo Cookie Cupcake. I don't have a huge sweet tooth but it's oreo! Definitely a laid back, casual good vibes coffee shop. I rate it 3.8... I kinda feel the prices are a bit high for the value but I do enjoy the space and would recommend Bean Around The World for your next coffee shop to try!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to share my poor experience here today at 12:45pm.  My family was next door finished our sushi lunch and our eyes were drawn to this coffee place.  We went inside and there were two staff not a hello greeting or acknowledgement.  The store was quite empty with just a table of two.   My bad experience stems from the staff that served my husband and I.  She just gave us blank stares and not even asked what we wanted standing in front of us while we stood there waiting to be served.  I opened my mouth and asked for 2 medium coffees.  She rang our order and then turned behind to get the coffees.  Came back 3 seconds later informing us that they were out of medium roast and if we were ok with dark roast.  A coffee place that didn't have medium roast on a Sunday at prime time?   She gave us this attitude and facial expression that I can tell she didn't give a care about working there and customers.  My husband proceeded to get the dark roast alternative while I excused myself of it.  When she returned my change she just threw it in my hand with attitude and I said thanks but she just swiftly turned away.   To the owner: I hope you take this review seriously and retrain your staff because a small business definitely requires good products as well equally important its customer service and this was such a poor experience that was enough to have us never return."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Not great coffee. Small cold press coffee about $3.50 and left me wanting a Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. Today was my first time trying it. I tried the Guatemalan drip coffee which is a medium blend with the Spicy Italian Panini. They went well together. There was open mic live music which was surprising since it was around noon.   The staff were accomodating and environment is very comfortable. Free wifi and water is provided.   Nice place to study, when there isnt live music. Otherwise I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice to visit a good coffee shop that's not part of a big chain. Good coffee and large assortment of teas. When possible we need to support independent and small businesses!!!  They make most of their own pasterns and they are good. There is also an assortment of other foods on the menu, I will have try them the next time ai visit.  The place is big and airy with plenty of seating. We visited on a Saturday and they had a guy playing guitar and singing. They encourage arts, the reason we visited was to attend a friends photography show.  When in the area drop by for a relaxing coffee."}
{"text":"Love how spacious this place is & Robert was so friendly!   The coffee flavours are so full and aromatic. Their baked goods were heavenly. We tried a blueberry scone & the corn muffin? Man whatever that was it was amaaaaaazing"}
{"text":"I like places like this. Open area with a few tables to enjoy your drink.  Since this is a new place I asked the person at the front counter what she would recommend. I already knew what I wanted but I just wanted to see what she would say. As if she were reading my mind she actually hit it right on the spot and recommended a frappe. I saw salted caramel as one of the flavours and I would sold right away. $4.99 is pretty much standard pricing these days but still ask myself why I spend $5 on a drink.   It tasted amazing and very refreshing on a hot summers day. Service was great and very speedy."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop with a very friendly owner and really pleasant staff.  Delicious assortment of fresh baked muffins and treats.  Extensive selection of coffee and tea.  With it was open a little later than 6 on Mon-Thurs. evenings  There is a variety of other food on the menu  - pizza and sandwiches.  I haven't tried anything else, yet, but definitely plan to!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is right beside one of my go to sushi restaurant, Osaka. I saw that it was finally open and decided to give them a try. I was warmly welcomed by two employees. I noticed right away that the interior was very modern and they had a huge selections of drinks and food. I was informed that the pastries were freshly baked in house and I saw that they have a pizza menu coming soon. I believe that this is a franchise from Vancouver and they're opening up two locations in Ontario.  I decided to try their iced white chocolate mocha ($5.65). I thought that the coffee was decent but I was hoping that more of the white chocolate came through. As for the price, I think they'll have a difficult time competing because there's a Starbucks down the street, three Tim Hortons around and two McDonald's (for a super cheap option).  However, I'm excited to try some of their pastries and even their pizza. I'll definitely do an updated review on their food!"}
{"text":"They often have live music or invite artists for open mic!  The staff is always friendly and helpful - perfect place to \"work from home\".  As others have said, WIFI is fast (password is their telephone number)."}
{"text":"Do not order the Peameal bacon on Ciabatta bread sandwich unless you like paying $7+ tax for a shite sandwich with processed cheese. Expect everything to be 10% more than Starbucks on average. When I spoke to the barista, he just smiled (like approvingly of my complaint) and asked me to speak to the owner instead! Unreal, stick to the overpriced coffee occasionally and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"it is a franchise coffee shop from the west, but it has the personal touch of small shop. There are regular art show, open mic for local artists.   Staff are friendly; coffee and pastry are yummy. I would love to visit there more often especially on Friday evenings for the Open Mic."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing experience as I had been looking forward to visiting this place. I want to like it... but given the experience I had I can only give it 2 stars.   Very spacious and clean. Not as many seats as you would expect at a cafe though, less than 10 tables for sure. There is an area by the window where there's live performances every Friday or smth but it's off to the side so it doesnt take up that much space. There's also a large communal table right when you walk in, which is really a waste of space imo; you can get a lot more seating if that was exchanged for a few smaller tables. My sister and I pretty much took that whole thing over since the place was empty except for 2 other tables already taken, but it is right by the door so when it opens it does get chilly in the winter. There's also not a lot of outlets available (hence we had to sit at that giant table because the plug was right there) so if you're planning on a date with your computer, you better bring an extra battery or an external charger.   Service was meh tbh. And that's what brought down the rating for me. Barristas were not too friendly and the girl working the till was the same. They're not rude to say the least, but don't expect them to be friendly or cheery like those at other cafes. Ie. The cashier looked like she hated her life while taking the orders... expressionless, and when I personally brought my finished mug back to their side counter, instead of saying thanks to the customer, the barrista just glanced at me and continued whatever he was doing. Great customer service dude, keep it up.   Prices are what you would expect. Nth out of the ordinary. Had a muffin and the London Fog and that was pretty good, at least you don't find these everywhere. Came in a large mug with the tea bag hanging over the edge; light yet aromatic. The muffin was a teensy bit on the dry side. Their menu has a good selection and judging by the number of people sitting versus getting take out, I'd say take out is a better option.   I did notice though that while sitting there for a bit, there was a strong smell at the place... kind of like burnt stuff or coffee or cooked/fried food. Not a pleasant smell like roasted coffee or pastries at other cafes. As soon as I left I knew I would reek of it... and I did.  Mixed feelings about this place... not sure if I would be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Beans Around the World is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  A franchise from BC and I am quite surprised that they opens up their first location in the East Coast in Markham!  The setup reminds me of Second Cup. My cappuccino was OK but cannot really compared to a well crafted espresso drink in some of the indie espresso bar.  Good place to have a coffee when in the area or to meet up with friends as the interior is quite spacious.   Barista is super friendly.   I would be back for an Americano and maybe some of those delicious looking pastries!  BTW, if you are like me, don't like cocoa powder sprinkle on top of your cappuccino, make sure you tell the barista when you put in your order. sigh..."}
