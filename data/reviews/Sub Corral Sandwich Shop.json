{"text":"I have been eating here since I was a little girl, and it is always the same!  It is friendly, simple, and delicious!  The sub bread is so good and the crinkle fries are awesome too.  Don't expect fancy, but do expect a good lunch."}
{"text":"I ate here Saturday Jan 17, 2015  grabbing a bite before my sons rugby match.  I hadn't been here in 6 years, so was a little surprised when my steak and cheese arrived and there was virtually no meat.  I think it tasted ok, but when you are just eating bread it's hard to tell.  It was $7.70 for an 8\" (medium) excluding tip which I gave prior to receiving my sub roll.  My perception would be 6oz of meat pepper onion and cheese the worse value dining since my trip to the zoo.

The positives:
The owner was super friendly, I heard she and her husband bought it two years ago, wish I knew how the value has lapsed"}
{"text":"Have been going here for a few years and it used to be one of my favorite places to get 'homemade' pizza and my family has always loved their chicken salad. However, the last time I went I ordered a large pizza, and when I say large it was absolutely huge! Which would be great if you needed pizza for a party or get together, for a fairly low price. BUT it was so subpar compared to how they usually are, I ordered with just cheese on one side and pepperoni on the other, it was so greasy. It was literally the greasiest food I've ever seen in my life, by the time I got it home (in Gastonia) all of the cheese and toppings had ran off of the crust and was laying in the corners of the pizza box. It was so greasy it saturated the box and leaked onto my car seat. Needless to say we ate maybe 3 pieces of this huge pizza, which we had to dab with a paper towel to absorb some grease, and the rest of such a large pizza went completely to waste had to throw it in the trash. I also ordered a cup of chicken salad +a chicken salad sub that day and the Chix salad tasted AWFUL, it was so hard and chewy, it had the texture of plastic. So our entire meal that day ended up in the trash. 

I would maybe give them another try, hoping that a different cook is working next time. But if you go, I suggest you tell them to try to make the pizza with as little grease as possible. 

And as far as the employees, I've found it depends on who's working as to what attitude you'll receive. Last time the lady was not friendly, she had an attitude much like my pizza... soggy."}
{"text":"Food is usually good, but for the love of God please clean the doors & windows,disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross..."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service the sandwiches were top notch! Definitely would recommend the Italian sub! My only complaint was the restaurant itself which definitely needs cleaning and updating!"}
{"text":"Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs, Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called, got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver, but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  
When I asked how we could compromise,  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.
I even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.

Sad for them, she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza, pretty pathetic huh?

{"text":"really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/
Wish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money, just threw that food in the trash, didn't even want my dog to eat it."}
{"text":"I gave four stars because the place was clean, food was good, and service was fast. The guy that took my order wasn't overly friendly, but he wasn't rude either. As for the food I judge a sandwich for the bread as much as anything, and the bread here is great - I got wheat. My sandwich was overstuffed, making it very hard to eat. The fries are crinkle cut and we're fantastic. I ate in, which afforded me unlimited self service refills. There is no table service here. Parking was easy and plentiful, just approach from the east ( coming from Charlotte ) because there is no access from the other way - you'll have to do a U-turn."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and fair prices. I've probably had lunch or dinner here close to 100 times in the last 15 years living here. They have had a couple of different owners in that time but food taste and quality has remained very consistent. Pizza is good and better than chains in the area. Love their take on the cheesesteak pita and pita burgers. Very friendly staff and food always hot and fresh. Can be a little pricey but definitely good quality meat and fresh ingredients other places don't have. Great place to stop for dinner at 5pm traffic on Wilkinson."}
{"text":"Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a \"give me 20 minutes\" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing."}
{"text":"If you enjoy dry bread, one thin slice of meat, and one thin slice of cheese with no flavor, this place is for you. The building is old and dirty. Never going back. Not one good thing to say."}
{"text":"This time i dined in. 
They have a big menu on the wall and when i finally made up my mind, placed my order. Staff wasn't rude, but didn't give me that thanks for coming feeling. 

Wasn't too thrilled with my choice this time, i thought it was the same thing i ordered last time, which i still can't remember the name...hot sandwich, beef, mushrooms, etc. i don't think i'll get that again, but i'm convinced that i will find something i really like there. The food never thrills me but entices me enough to try again. Fries were good with ketchup as predicted. 

Highlight: there is a picture of Macho Man Randy Savage on the wall around the corner."}
{"text":"I came in here with my neighbor! I ordered the steak and cheese and he ordered the meatball sub. Not only was our order fast, it was SO good. The elderly woman was as sweet as could be & the young man that brought us our food was cheerful. I love the Celtic photos on the wall, and the amount of people that draw on the wooden seats provide a homey, childhood-esque feel to the place. 

Good food, good service & good atmosphere. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. So many places sell themselves as NY style pizza... this place doesn't even give you a hint they have pizza and it's the best I've had since I've moved from NY. Not only that,  but were Sub Corral in NY, I would rate it my 3rd favorite pizza in the entire metropolitan area, behind only Di Fara's in Brooklyn and Amoré in Queens... and I'm someone who travels for food.
Speaking of Amoré, I love their meatballs, which is very rare for me to find in a pizzeria or restaurant. Great in meatball parm or calzone (with onions too)
I've also had their Italian combo sub with the hot cherry pepper relish on it (hoagie spread) and it's amazing. 
And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Simply Great Food
Today was my first time eating here and I will be back.
Price is reasonable 
Food is fresh and tastes amazing 
Very pleased with my decision to eat here .."}
{"text":"We stop here from time to time when we need a quick bite. They have a nice variety of sandwiches and remind us of the little corner places all over philadelphia where we went to college. The owners are very friendly and there seems to be a pretty regular following. Steaks and meatball subs are good and the bread seems straight out of Philly. Add the provolone and some hot peppers. Get the fries well done. They are the crinkle type and remind us of Nathan's. My son gets the pizza most times. I would not say it's Brooklyn caliber but way above average. The burgers have tons of variations all named in kind of a golf theme. Some have said the place seems dirty but I don't get that impression at all. The building is older and booths are all carved with graffiti from decades of use. If you have ever been to Gino's East in Chicago, you'd get the idea. It's \"corner joint\" early west Mew York nostalgia style. They also decorated with all of the local high school regalia which I think is cool. As far as health inspections, they have always gotten an \"A\" if you look at health departments web site. Current score was a 98 so the kitchen is cleaner than most chain places staffed by a bunch of teenagers. Prices are in line, in our opinion, for homemade food. Next time you head over the bridge on Wilkinson into Belmont, give it a try."}
