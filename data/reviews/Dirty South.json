{"text":"My cousin decided to go to this restaurant for her birthday. Had it not been for her plans (and I only based my decision on the yelp reviews), I would have opted for a different restaurant.   However, I am happy that I went. My food was very delicious. I got the fried pork chops and they were great! My sides were rice and gravy (hard to mess up) and greens (nothing like my families home cooked greens but okay). Later, my cousin commented that only their fried food and breakfast food is good. Everything else is less than pleasing (she was a little more harsh).   The service was slow (they were understaffed). The waitress was very nice. And after tasting my fried pork chops, I felt it was worth the wait :-).  I would try this place again."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was good at first, but I couldn't find a side that didn't taste stale and canned. I really wanted to like this place and was going to try it again; however, the food left a bad after taste in my mouth. It almost seemed like the food was cooked in old oil. On the positive side, my to go order was still steaming hot when I got home."}
{"text":"Food was piping hot, which is great!! Had the buffet...and it truly is all you can eat!! You order whatever you want off the menu (except chitlins) and they bring it out to you!!! Mac n cheese, greens, and black eyed peas were pretty good!! Fried chicken was pretty good too! Will come back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday and was told that the only menu available was for the all you eat at $16.99 per person.  Really??? You would rather turn down business if it's less?  Does not make good business sense which is why I'm glad we chose not to stay. We can only imagine what everything would have been like.  Definitely won't have a 2nd chance to make a first impression. On to bigger and better things!"}
{"text":"Food sucked unfortunately.  I hate to say this because i love supporting small black owned businesses.  The loud singing was nauseating.  I think it was just too loud (and unnecessary) for such a small place.  Also, the singer (who has a lovely voice) hides behind a wall so you can't even see her which makes the loud singing even more annoying for some reason.  Customer service was over the top.  They tried so hard that they were annoying.  Every few minutes they approached my table.  It was hard to enjoy a conversation (as we talked about the bad food) without being interrupted.  The serving plates/bowls were cheap and the presentation of the food was off.  This was a few months ago close to the grand opening so they may have improved.  I would give them another try because trial and error is important as long as they are willing to listen to reviews and improve.  They have potential because the items I mentioned in my review are mostly about great attempts gone wrong.  The point is that they are trying hard so we gotta give them a second shot....right?  I will edit my review after I try them again.....soon."}
{"text":"A friend and I had the all you can eat breakfast at the Dirty South this past weekend. Everything was prepared to order and tasted great. You can not beat the price of under $10 for their breakfast. We will be back and will be bringing friends.  This is a very casual place and the wait staff is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We had the all you could eat dinner. We had to wait between each entree for 25-30 min, by that time you do not want to eat anymore.  The sides were cold when they were first brought to us. Everything is sweet from the potato salad to the beans.  The ribs were the best part they did fall off the bone.  The service was friendly, but very lackadaisical. The inside temperature was very uncomfortable, we were sweating, because it was so hot. The eating utensils need a upgrade, very cheap. Not a good experience at all. The place does have potential, but needs a lot of  work as a whole."}
