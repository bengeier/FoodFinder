{"text":"Am very surprised, on why there is no review on this property.  This is by far the best fresh Desi food anyone can have.You can't beat the price & service.   If you haven't, definetly give it a try.  Biryani, chicken karahi was absolutely tasty."}
{"text":"Friendly owners and consistently good food.  Prices have increased slightly in the two years that we've been coming here.  Good take out place or maybe to sit down and grab a quick bite.   Highly recommend Bihari kabab roll and their nihari."}
{"text":"Started coming here when they first opened, owners have changed a few times now. The present owners are very friendly and make amazing fresh food. The weekend breakfast is a tradition around the house, quantities are awesome for $3.99. Their Biryani is also a must try!"}
{"text":"The owners are so nice. Zinger sandwich is amazing!! The location is small so more of a takeout spot but the flavour is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is more of a takeout joint. Friendly people;  I ordered the chicken biryani.  I think it was 5.99 or something, so it was cheap.  Served with a heaping portion of rice and a reasonable amount of chicken for the price.   What I liked was that they cooked it fresh, but it did take about 15 minutes, and I would expect a bit quicker for biryani.    In addition, they had a nice display/hot tables of curries, etc. I didn't get any of those, but they looked quite appetizing.  Verdict: I think it'd be a good place in you are in the area, but not worth a special trip. Probably a good work lunch place."}
