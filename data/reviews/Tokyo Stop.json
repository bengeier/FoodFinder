{"text":"Hole in the wall place that at first glance looks dingy on the inside, forgotten on the outside. Dude at the counter could not stop coughing during my entire order, that should have been a clear signal this place is on life support. Mistakenly didn't order the lunch& went for the Chicken Katsu /Sweet n Sour combo plate (they even throw a ton of rice). The Katsu was old and had zero flavor & below average dipping sauce.  Sweet n Sour chkn was bland and made yesterday. Not recommended nor will I go back voluntarily."}
{"text":"Great rice bowls, fast service even when they are slammed, which is typical at lunchtime. Limited seating so plan for takeout. Also, there is a convenient small Asian grocery located next door."}
{"text":"Great place especially considering it is \"fast food.\" The food was delicious (I had the chicken yakisoba), the serving size was plenty and I only had to wait for two minutes before getting my food. The cashier lady was extremely nice and pleasant to be around as well. This placed surprised me to be completely honest, I would recommend it to my friends, and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I keep going back to Tokyo Stop, as do all my friends, so I'm giving it an extra star. Plus, it's always packed! 

The teriyaki chicken is my new favorite. It's large enough to share with a friend for lunch, as long as you get the lunch combo... : )"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last year and a half and have yet to be disappointed. The man at the counter is always very friendly and their food is actually pretty good for the price and convenience. 

Check it out if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"One of the better places to get a fast-food, Asian noodle dish in the Tempe area. 

The chicken yakisoba is stir fried with carrots, broccoli, and a very healthy amount of noodles. The chicken is nicely seared, occasionally burned, but well-seasoned. It is a bit oily. Goes well with a few drops (or 20) of Sriracha. This is my go-to dish.

The chicken teriyaki bowl is a comfort-sort with rice that is fluffy and not grainy or overcooked. The decent amount of chicken is seared a bit, not as much as the yakisoba. The sauce is light and tasty. I like that it's not drowned like in most other Americanized Asian restaurants. I've had the combo with a little salad and 3 gyozas. The gyozas are on the small side with little filling - kind of bleh. The salad...eh.

The counter-service is fast and to-the-point. You can take a little plastic container for soy sauce or Sriracha sauce for take-outs. There is very little seating and it does get busy during lunch rushes."}
{"text":"The owners are Korean, the lady was really nice.
She made eye contact and smiled and greeted us.

The guy... I don't think he meant to be racist,
but when a couple Latinos/ ppl of Hispanic decent came in the store and orders,
he goes \"Amigo, someting wrong?\" 
I could not believe my ears lol.

The food... I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic)

I ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi.

Sukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat.
Bulgogi was not well seasoned.

The food was bland and nasty.

Was NOT worth the 15 bucks. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place, I got a veggie yakisoba.
I was very impressed that their vegetables seem to be cooked from fresh, not frozen. I also really like that they have a smaller size option about half the size of your usual styrofoam box. It was greasier than I care for, but that is a common issue with fast food yakisoba noodles.

The second time I went I got a tofu veggie thing over rice. I was starving so I thought it was great, until I came across a piece of chicken in it. Regardless of being vegetarian, meat does need to be stored seperately to be sanitary, so this is worrisome. My boyfriend ate the rest of it and said he thought it was \"ok\" but he would've rather had something else. 

I really wanted to like this place since its so convenient for me, but I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb. And they give you good portions. Every time I go, I'm super full afterwards. The food is great. I love the sweet and sour. The service is good too. You should go here!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Udon noodle soup and it was delicious. The customer service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Since my arrival to Tempe last year, this is the only teriyaki restaurant I enjoy, I've tried a few other spots around town but none surpass Tokyo Stops superb taste or quality of customer service and affordable pricing. I've never been to Tokyo, but if the eats are as good as Tokyo Stop in Tempe I must visit someday! Just today I enjoyed another delicious meal from here. I must say I am a big fan of Tokyo Stop every time without a glitch my plate is prepared to perfection. Tokyo Stop is a small restaurant with a big taste with very limited seating, therefor I usually always order carry-out. During lunch hours long lines can be expected, which is a good indicator that the food here is pleasantly tasteful. I usually almost always stop by during lunch hours and I can honestly say the ambience here during lunch is pretty calm even though many hungry lunch seekers love to patronize this restaurant. Customers can be seen waiting outside as they wait patiently for their order number to be called next. Inside siting is limited I believe I counted seven small tables some seating four others just for two. 
         I almost always order a lunch box combo which consists of generous portion of spicy teriyaki chicken on a bed of savory brown rice and crispy crap puffs as my preferred choice of side, all this eats for just under nine-dollars. The chicken is soft and tender and to dry as its often made to order. The bed of brown rice they serve with this entrée is usually cooked perfectly, although the standard type of rice served alongside every plate is steamed white grain rice. Every large lunch box comes with two sides, I would recommend you guys try the savory crispy crab puffs made fresh to order every time. Dip them inside a sweet orange sauce that is house made, I know I asked! For those cautious eaters out there, I recommend the steamed vegetables which consist of squash, cabbage, and carrots. I must point out that the best part of \"Lunch Box E\" is the spicy teriyaki sauce, which is made from scratch. It has enough kick to it to satisfy any spice enthusiast, but sweet enough like a proper teriyaki glaze should be. 
          I eat here at least twice a week, I really like how welcoming their customer service is here. every time I choose to patronize this restaurant I am greeted upon my entry. I believe this is a family operated business, with hired help cooking in the kitchen. Customer service here is great, when I call they always recognize my voice and know exactly how I want my order made \"sauce on the side and no chives\" every time! I orders are always fresh and handed over with a warm smile alongside a good amounts of condiments like mustard and soy sauce. Overall Tokyo Stop is a great spot to grab lunch on the go! [500wrds]"}
{"text":"this place used to be great. The guys in my office went once a week.  New ownership came, they changed the recipes so now it's gone downhill. Big time.  Please change the recipes back!!!!  I miss the old Tokyo Stop."}
{"text":"Maaannnn...I can't stop thinking about this place. Great place to chow down after a long day of work or taking a break from classes. Everything on the menu is great, and the portions are plenty big, waaaayyyy much more food than panda's or anywhere else. I got food poisoning at Kyoto bowl down the street.

Worth coming back again you guys won't be disappointed. Try their lunch specials. Trust me I know my Asian foods."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My \"go to\" for a quick pick up and great food. Favorite is the lunch boxes."}
{"text":"i was a HUGE fan of this place when i was at ASU!  very hearty portions, a of meat too.  usually makes for 2 meals.  oh, and cheap!

the owners are super friendly and remember their regulars.

i believe they are linked too the japanese market over in the corner of the same shopping center... which is also a GREAT place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Tokyo Stop. I'm a huge bulgogi/yakiniku fan so the fact that they offered it was a big plus to start with. I'm not huge on veggies in my bulgogi though so thats what cost it a star. It was very tasty however and a large portion. The fact that a Japanese place calls it bulgogi sorta threw me a little bit. Like some others on here I was wondering if it was Japanese or Korean too. I'm going Japanese as the owner & I had a lovely conversation about my time living in Japan. He commented \"I miss Japan\" and, of course, I said \"I do too\". Anyone that knows me or my family knows these words are uttered several times a week in our house, usually after waxing sentimental about my beloved MOS Burger. I'll have to try the curry that Matthew K. recommends. Its a tossup as to whether curry or yakiniku is my fav food in the world."}
{"text":"You get what you see. It's not a bad place, you get fast Japanese cuisine so I guess it makes sense that the quality of food isn't stellar. The ramen I ordered was bland and the miso was salty. The California roll had avocado that had seen better days. I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I took my wife to lunch here last week. We both were very disappointed. We sat near the kitchen door. The food was terrible. I have had the teriyaki chicken many times before. This time the chicken was as dry as bacon, and the sauce didn't taste like teriyaki. My wife ordered sweet and sour pork. She  took 2 bites and was afraid to eat more. I tasted it. Neither of us liked it, and we agreed it wasn't even close to tasting like sweet and sour anything.

The table was sticky. The floor of the kitchen was filthy. I used to pop in here for lunch. Never again."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before eating here. I have had three entree's and they were all exellent. Sushi is fresh and delicious. Clean establishment and friendly fast service on all occasions that I was there. The lunch specials are great!"}
{"text":"The owner is the best! So nice and he makes every effort to remember everyone. I don't know how he does it but after my second visit probably spread out over a month he remembered my name and my order. He greets everyone as they walk in too. This place starts jamming at lunch. Not a lot of seating so if your planning on going during the lunch rush you may want to call in your order ahead of time or take it to go. This food is good for the price. The rice is great and the chicken and other entrees are as good as any other rice bowl restaurant. They have an apple cinnamon green tea that I really enjoy. Overall, pretty good...probably not the best quality, but the rice and veggies are really fresh, the food is tasty and the service comes with a smile."}
{"text":"I have visited Tokyo Stop twice now for an a-ok lunch. There's nothing really bad about Tokyo Stop, but it just hasn't blown my socks off. On my first visit I had the bulgogi plate. It was HUGE. Full of hot marinated beef and a large serving of white rice. I've had bulgogi several times before and this bulgogi is a-ok. Again, not the best I have had, but not bad! I poured Sriracha all over it and I was a happy girl! The second time I visited, I ordered the teriyaki chicken combo. Again, another a-ok dish. Nothing fancy! The prices for each dishs is VERY reasonable. I don't think I've paid over $7 for anything.

I would most certainly visit Tokyo Stop again. They offer a solid lunch at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Affordable, good food, friendly owners-- if I move away I'm definitely going to mourn the loss of my favorite Japanese place.

As far as food... The crab puffs are some of the best I've ever had! We religiously get these, as they're a steal and don't taste fake. The yakisoba is also up there for best dishes. The only downside with Tokyo Stop is the meat seems to be a bit dry sometimes, so the noodles definitely help give a bit of moisture back. 

I'm also really excited that they've added ramen to their menu! It's really good, the broth not too thick or thin, and the noodles and meat cut perfectly. Good selection of different types, with the tonkotsu being a personal favorite. Definitely go here instead of the weird fusion ramen places that don't really know what ramen's supposed to taste like. The only downside is the portion is slightly small compared to what I'm used to, so no extra meals out of it for me. 

Like others have said, their portions generally are pretty big, which means you can either share or have a lunch for the next day out of it. 

PS: Grab yourself a Ramune while you're there. Definitely a good addition to your meal."}
{"text":"This place gives me mixed feelings, but we will come back again to see which way it really rates.  
Pros: the prices are great, the lunch food was good,  the server was pleasant and it was comfortable inside.
Cons: the floor was dirty and the water & tea service containers were pretty rough looking.   They either need a good cleaning or to be replaced.   I had some of the lemon water and it was off.
Mentioned that to the server, he tried it, and replaced the water.  Tried it before we left, not any better.  The water had an odor I just couldn't get past.
Hubs tried the lunch combo, good price, a nice portion, and it was tasty.  It came with a small salad that was lettuce with cucumbers and carrots.  He enjoyed the potstickers and tried the eggroll, while I had the krab puffs.  The items came fresh out of the fryer, piping hot but not greasy.  The teriyaki chicken was well flavored and savory.  
He tried the green tea but again the taste was off, the fountain drinks were fine.  At 2:30 pm it was slow, and that was my challenge about the floors.  It would have taken a minute to grab the mop, but it didn't happen."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Very fast. Very bright and cheery. Delicious bulgogi! Order at the counter, have a seat, and they bring the delicious, piping hot food to you."}
{"text":"I really like their yakisoba noodle dish, and I love that they're always happy to accommodate my request that it come with chicken, beef AND shrimp.  They charge a couple bucks more for the indulgence, but to me it's waaaay worth it, I highly recommend placing this special order.  Squirt a pool of The Rooster in a corner of the container on your way out . . . ahhh, yeah

The hot & spicy anything is good, and for those trying to cut the carbs, the chicken teriyaki salad is a must.  Delicious and light.  And they automatically put the teriyaki sauce on the side, which is nice, giving you the choice to drench or drizzle

The prices are great for the huge portions you get.  I learned quickly that you're not just ordering lunch, you're also ordering leftovers.  I've never once finished an entree in one sitting.  The only negatives . . . I haven't really been impressed with any of the sides, and the sushi is beyond blah.  The seating area is tiny, but I've never gone there to sit and eat, so no biggie to me.  What I do know, is that when I call for lunch takeout and they say \"10 minutes\", they mean it.  Can't beat that

Been making a Tokyo Stop run for lunch every couple of months for a few years now.  Considering I usually only leave work for lunch a couple times a month, that's a good ratio.  Definitely give it a try if you're near University and Priest"}
{"text":"Curry chicken is perfect! Tastes pretty authentic. Reminds me of the Japanese curries in Hawaii."}
{"text":"this is my 2nd time here.  1st time was ok and packed during lunch hour, this time i got there at 5:30pm for dinner, empty .. i ordered a combo plate .. sukiyaki and chicken and let me tell you how disappointed i am so disappointed i will never go back.  this guy gave me chicken and left out any beef in the sukiyaki ..."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Although I have to say, i kind of feel lousy now but it might just be due to eating so much of it, so fast. 

Had the spicy pork, which was, well, very spicy. Cheap too. The place is small and i have heard its fairly busy. You can call ahead or order on their web site (web site sucks, btw)."}
{"text":"Really good! Friendly people and quick service. We come here often--fresh vegetables, great noodles, and yummy sauces!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch! They have \"Lunch box\" specials that come with sushi! Totally awesome! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Good food great service at a very good price, only complaint is the hours and closed on weekends other than that it's great!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten the lunch takeout, so my review is on the food and not the entire restaurant experience.  

For lunch, I had the vegetable bowl combo and crab puffs.  First of all, the portion size was huge.  You definitely get a lot for your money.  Second, it's obvious that the teriyaki sauce was just poured over the vegetables, which made me a little sad. I definitely prefer to have my sauce and veggies cooked together, so the veggies pick up some of the flavors.   Not to mention, the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland.  The veggies were cooked very well, although I would have liked some tofu or water chestnuts/bamboo shoots, or sesame seeds in with my veggies.  The only veggies that came with the dis were cabbage, broccoli, and carrots; no onion, no garlic, no flavor.  The crab puffs were basically crab rangoon, only all the good stuff and not too much cream cheese.  The downside was that the \"crab\" in the crab puffs was also bland and my order didn't come with the sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"The only words that come to mind when I think about Tokyo Stop are deliciousness, fast, and cheap!

Per the advice of other Yelp readers, I had their Japanese Noodles and the chicken curry.  I wasn't a huge fan of the curry.. I wished it was not as thick and spicier... the Noodles however, more than made up for the shortcomings of the curry.   

I definitely will go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love going to this teriyaki spot! My bf and I always get double teriyaki chicken meal letter E with a side of gyoza and cream cheese crab puffs with apple cinnamon tea. They also have sriracha on every table and little to go cups at the register.   Always quick and hot! Recommended to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. It's more like a family owned restaurant feeling. Great to grab some quick lunch and the price is reasonable for the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and I go at least once a week, not once have I been disappointed. Great customer service and affordable price. Teriyaki chicken with veggies and fried rice is my favorite. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than five stars!  The food is delicious with generous portions and affordable prices.  The staff is very kind!  It's a hole-in-the-wall type of location and is small inside, but that should not deter you from enjoying the wonderful food they offer!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here not long ago for the first time and I was very pleased! I got lunchbox C, the teriyaki chicken with salad and gyoza, and everything was very tasty and prepared very quickly. The staff was incredibly kind and very grateful for the tip I left. Great place, I'll definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price, big portions for just 7 bucks and friendly customer service. My favorite so far is the house chili with extra veggies!"}
{"text":"Love the service. Food is better than momma chiaki's cooking. Thought the guy at the front desk was a total babe"}
{"text":"Good teriyaki, friendly staff, very limited seating, good price, fast service, very busy during lunch. I always order Lunch box E - it comes with teriyaki chicken, steamed rice, spring roll, crab puff and a drink. Only $7."}
{"text":"Chicken taste really fresh and also I love spicy sauce!!! 
Best Teriyaki place ever!!"}
{"text":"Place is clean and Teriyaki chicken box is so delicious. It is chicken breast not like other places where is more fat and bone than chicken. The staff is friendly and they have a fast service! Good place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for lunch for over 6 years now.  Clearly a family owned joint that cares about making each customer feel valued and welcome.

Listen, it's not the greatest food in the world, but for the price and service it's damn good!  

I LOVE the hot and spicy chicken or beef.  My mouth waters very time I think about smothering it in Sriracha sauce.  The veggies and rice are good, but there are times the veggies could be fresher.  There are other times it's great though.  I usually ask for extra veggies so i can pretend I'm being healthy.  Well, that, and the fact that they don't give you much with the regular sized plate.  The extra veggies are free too.  

The teriyaki chicken is very good as well as the bulgogi.  The food is cooked fresh and the service tells you that they are really doing everything they can to make you happy.  

Check it out for a quick lunch, but beware there can be long lines around 12:45.  It's hit or miss.  If its too busy check out the Original Hoagie Shop next door for amazing food and service as well."}
{"text":"Great place! Perfect for chicken and rice bowls, spicy bowl actually had a kick to it and their teriyaki is good little sweet for me but still good! . Good portions, quick service, friendly staff - reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I'm currently eating the lunch I just picked up from here.  I picked up because the place is small and has really few seats and they were all full.  Long line to order and pick up which is usually a good sign.  Decided to try the teriyaki chicken and potstickers.  Since I've been in Phoenix I've only found one teriyaki place I like, which is tough because I used to eat teriyaki all the time when I lived in Seattle.  The potstickers I am currently eating are delicious.  They are crispy, just the way I like them, and they have great flavor.  I could eat these all day.  The teriyaki chicken is good, but is just swimming in sauce.  I know a lot of people like a lot of sauces on their food, so please disregard my comments if you are one of those people, but I am a minimalist when it comes to sauces so this is a little much for me.  If I order this again I will definitely ask for the sauce on the side.  Good place for take out, not so much for dining in, especially during the lunch rush (I went in just after noon).  I'll probably come back here but definitely won't be able to finish the teriyaki chicken I got today due to the sauce."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and the food has never let me down! Super flavorful food, and affordable, they also give you good portions sizes for what you pay"}
{"text":"This place is great, food is always fresh and delicious. Even during their lunch rush, orders come out quickly. The chicken teriyaki, orange chicken and chicken katsu are my go-to's of theirs. I frequently come get lunch for the office here, and everyone loves it. Great family run, local business. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm so upset with myself for not reviewing this place sooner.  The food is amazing, and the staff is friendly.  The location is in a slightly rough looking area, but don't let that deter you, the food is worth it!  Speaking of food, I usually get the bulgogi which is the best I've ever had outside of homemade.  I've also had the chicken katsu and orange chicken, which I think they use the same the chicken, but for some reason I'm not a big fan of the katsu, but I love the orange chicken, go figure.  I've also had the udon which has good flavor and nice thick noodles.  Lastly, the potstickers, do yourself a favor and just order those with every meal.  Some how they magically stay crispy all the way back to the office or home.  The only negative to this place is they aren't open on the weekends and they close at 6pm during the week, but I guess like they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder."}
{"text":"Charlie is really friendly. If you introduce yourself, he will call you by name everytime you come back. The food is all really tasty. I'm partial to the house chili, but everything I've had there has been good. I think it's kind of healthy. I know it's inexpensive. And all the hot dishes come out piping hot, which is reassuring from a food safety perspective. You have to wonder about that aspect at competing restaurants."}
{"text":"Great fast Asian food. Place was packed during lunch. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I like that combos are so cheap and cone with fresh potstickers."}
{"text":"absolutely the worst place i've eaten in. i ordered tempura udon and the soup had like dried bamboo sprouts? it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting. too much carrot and overall, not worth the price you pay. my sister ordered spicy ramen i tried to taste the soup and it was way too salty. not going back to this place ever. i ended up eating the mochis that i bought from the japanese market in the same shopping mall for dinner. we left over half because of the weird smell in the food."}
{"text":"My office is 2 doors down suite 9.  
Eat here very often. Love the teriyaki chicken and noodles."}
{"text":"This place is a great little hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Love the Teriyaki chicken that they have here and the prices are good too.  The owner was always very nice whenever I went here.  Miss going to eat here now that I've moved out of the area."}
{"text":"Had a beef/chicken bowl, it was okay. The meat was a little bit tough but good for strengthening the teeth."}
{"text":"Looking for a fast meal and ended up hitting up this place. Ordered the spicy pork bulgogi. The place was busy but the wait for the food was pretty painful...I was starting to get worried until the food finally came. It was absolutely delicious. It had the perfect amount of spiciness and was cooked the perfection. Good combination of veggies as well in the mix. Overall, great place to grab some grub but make sure you have some time to wait...it might be a bit slow."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and they have a lot of variety. I personally like their yakisoba and katsu curry. They just added ramen and the spicy one I tried was very tasty. I also like how the place is always clean too. A solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"Really not impressed. At all.

I judge a Japanese restaurant by their katsudon. In this case, it was really \"ma ma\"--\"not so good\" in Nihongo (Japanese). As a matter of fact, I quit eating it after the second bite and ordered a tonkotsu ramen.

This was definitely not a traditional katsudon. Instead of a sliced katsu, steeped in shoyu sauce base with cooked mixed egg and onion slices on top of rice, it was sort of chunks of katsu with sort of egg mixed in with large chopped pieces of onion sort of mixed in with rice--and no shoyu-based sauce. Very dry. Not appetizing. And the katsu was over-cooked and somewhat tough. I would give this katsudon only 1.5 stars.

The ramen was better. Decent broth, decent ingredients. However, there was way too much bean sprouts in it which totally got in the way of enjoying the noodles. I really didn't like it being served in a paper cup/bowl, either. I would give the ramen 3 stars.

I had a bite of my wife's yakisoba. It was OK, not great. Maybe 2.5 or 3 stars.

Service was very friendly. I do not think he is Nihonjin, though or else he really does not know the language because the little Japanese I spoke to him in Japanese tradition, he kind of mumbles something inaudible back."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Arizona (11 years ago) I missed good Japanese food.  Little did I know that a few minutes from where I worked there was this little treasure.  It's great.  Over the years I've seen different owners come and go and the food somehow stays the same.  I suppose if it aint broke don't go f'ing around with it.  

The Yakisoba is good.  The combo chicken teriyaki with veggies is good.  A large is food enough for three people easily.  Unless you are completely famished.  The green tea they have makes you feel like you are cleaning out all the impurities from the weekend and putting something good in your body.  

They have a limited delivery zone and it has to be over $20.00.  Oh I almost forgot the potstickers are good too.  The dipping sauce is so simple and yet I have NEVER been able to duplicate it @ home."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to get great teriyaki chicken on the fly, at a great place look no further. The owner is extremely friendly, and the portions are large. The chicken is grilled to perfection, and the rice is cooked just right. It's the place to go if you're hungry and want to spend less than $8 for lunch (drink included)."}
{"text":"I was initially afraid to enter because I thought I'd we'd be the only gaijin customers but, I actually had nothing to worry about. I ordered shrimp yakisoba and received my money's worth. Props to not only the great food but the polite owner!"}
{"text":"Their House chili chicken is delicious and no one else in the valley makes it the way Tokyo Stop does. I took another job and its worth the 30 minute round trip drive. I dump the shiracha sauce on it for added spice. Other eateries around me do not have the menu they do. I think Tokyo Stop is unique."}
{"text":"Always remember. You get what you paid for. Don't expect high quality Japanese food.  I decided to give 3 stars because food is about average. I ordered lunch combo D and spicy tuna roll.  It comes with Chicken, vegetables, edamame, potstickers and a drink. 

Chicken was  dry, it was expected.  I think many people have commented same about chicken being little dry.  It is cooked on charbroiler. So expect the little dryness.  

Spicy tuna roll was fresh and enjoyable. I think they just made it when i ordered it. So make sure to ask when it was made before ordering.  Because it is already made and stored inside the container.

Service was good. Owner was friendly and attentive. 

For the money. This place is a great for quick lunch. I would revisit again if I am in the area.  However, I wouldn't make an effort to drive the distance just to eat."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I work down the street from this place, that being said, it's general closeness to my work does mean that it's more attractive to me. 

So basically, Tokyo Stop is a \"fast food\" asian place that delivers HUGE. If you are starving, this is the place to go. I'm serious. You know those mexican places that serve up burritos that keep you full for the entire day? Same concept, different genre of food. 

So far, I've had 4 meals there, the Sweet and Sour Chicken, The Orange Chicken, the Hot and Spicy Chicken, and the House Chili Chicken, and I'm only going to review the first 3, because the House Chile and the Hot  and Spicy were the exact same thing. 

With the Sweet & Sour/Orange chicken, the restaurant suffers slightly. I attribute that to the fact that the super deep fried pieces of chicken are completely soaked in sauce. For the Sweet & Sour, the addition of Sriracha helped add the \"sour\" to the sauce, but for the Orange...well lets just say I've had my fill of Orange Marmalade for a year. 

The Hot & Spicy is really where this place shines. The chicken is perfectly cooked( lightly fried in chili oil) and topped off with vegetables and chilis. Goes great with the tableside spicy rice seasoning.

And now, the price. For about 6 bucks, you get a huge meal, and wonderful service. My only issue with place (minus the sauce) is the lack of room, but Dunkin Donuts is right down the way, and they have outside tables. 

It isn't perfect, but it's tasty and fast. I've certainly had better, but I keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is small, but very busy.  The staff is very nice and the food was amazing.  I ordered the katsu.  Worth the drive for me and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken after hearing about this place from a coworker and while the presentation was not particularly amazing, the chicken itself was very good. The chicken is char-grilled, but not too much; it gives a little extra texture and flavor that helps a lot. It's served over simple white-rice which is obviously bland, but the teriyaki has a good flavor which fixes that problem. The sauce is a little too sweet, but not bad, flavor-wise. The atmosphere isn't anything special, but overall, it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Huge portions, their lunch usually gives me two lunches. Veggies are just slightly sautéed, like that they were still fresh and crisp.

Curry is great but my favourite is probably the spicy chicken. 

Good place for a quick, cheap, filling and healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of affordable lunch prices for quality food and was told they have great lunch options at an affordable price.

While yes, the food was correctly priced, I was not a fan of the food itself.

I ordered a regular orange chicken with fried rice. The portion was a great size. However, the chicken looked and tasted like it was fried yesterday and the fried rice had no semblance of \"crispy\"ness that you want from fried rice. 

The rice looked like white rice with a little soy sauce on it and had absolutely no flavor. Customary fried rice ingredients include eggs, carrots and other veggies, but this had one small bite of carrot pieces and nothing else to keep me from diving in. No seasoning, no flavor.

The chicken, which was dark meat, had an overly chewy texture compared to ordinary dark meat. The fry on the chicken, as I alluded to earlier, was old, disgusting and left an unfortunate taste in my mouth. Worst of all, it felt \"heavy\" and it still is sitting in my stomach.

I threw out my lunch because if I wanted day old fried chicken with an unflavorful sauce on it, I would have gone to a supermarket.

UPDATE: thankfully I was able to abort the food from my stomach with heavy doses of ipecac."}
{"text":"I looked over at some other folks eating meat over rice, and those looked like better offerings. Sadly, the ramen was on par with dorm room cooking and should be avoided. 

The noodles were actually not half bad, it was everything else that let it down. And what was up with dining in out of a paper soup bowl? The pork slices were dry and bland. Not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up. Interestingly half of the bowl was filled with bean sprouts. In itself that's not a problem, but it meant that it took up room that could have been occupied by some other treats.

Not a ramen stop by any means. Of note, it's next to a Japanese grocery store and a Japanese bakery."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Katsu and it was not fresh. They had basically taken Katsu that had been fried and cut up and re-fried it and yes, it was nasty and nothing like what Chicken Katsu is when it is done fresh. I wish they would just put \"re-fried\" Chicken Katsu on the board and I would have known not to order it. In addition, I thought it would come with some sort of veggie, even sliced cabbage but it was Katsu and rice. 

I will say the Katsu sauce is excellent but not good enough to try the Katsu again. I will try the Yakisoba if I go back again, and may raise the review but not cool to what they did with the Chicken Katsu so I'm a little disappointed in the establishment. 

Bottom line, if you want to order the Chicken Katsu, ask them if it will be fresh made, not Katsu that is sliced and the re-fried."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu curry.. Or heck any of their curry is amazing."}
{"text":"They get pretty busy during lunch but they are fast and the food is always tasty! Better than Panda Express definitely and it's always good to support small businesses. They have a variety of lunch specials - I always get the $7.99 lunch box which comes with teriyaki chicken, an egg roll, and three crab puffs."}
{"text":"Best Japanese curry this side of Kyoto.  Other items are pretty good too but you gotta get away from the same old teriyaki people.  Food has always been hot and fresh.  Service has been great too.  I've been coming here for about 10 years and always really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best Japanese/Asian fastfood/rice bowl places in the valley.  I have been going to them for over 10 years when I have worked at various places in the Tempe area.  They have really good rice bowls and a large variety of toppings to put in them, from curry to teriyaki to bulgogi to spicy chicken, chili chicken and good veggies.   I really like the miso soup they have and often order that as a side.  
I would like to see a couple of things: a smaller side dish of california rolls, and soup.  On the lunch combos, I'd like to see a bit more flexibility with a choice of entree and two sides rather than a list of set entrees and sides.  Normally this might subtract a star from the \"As good as it gets\" rating but Tokyo Stop has been consistently good to me for so long that they get the bonus star.  They also get a bonus for taking American Express (they used to not)."}
{"text":"I guess it would be passable to someone who is not familiar with Japanese food.  This is not authentic Japanese cuisine.  Katsu is not katsu, fried chicken bits.  Katsu sauce they offer is a plum sauce, horrible.  I would not recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already. Regular serving of food. Family operated spot, the mom always has a smile. Food is on point. The teriyaki chicken/beef is a bit sweet for me and overly sauced, but to each their own. My other friends dug it. Lunch bento boxes are priced right for what you get. Hence why I've been back multiple times. Still exploring the area but I'm a creature of habit."}
{"text":"Great stuff! 

The guy at the counter / owner is awesome and really made us feel welcome. I had a teriyaki lunch special with a small salad and 2 california rolls. The teriyaki was awesome! The salad was \"ok\", some lettuce carrots and cucumber. The rolls were good too. 

It's really close to my work so I'm sure I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"We originally stopped at the little Japanese store next door for their lunch bowls, but being underwhelmed by the selection and seeing very little room inside to eat, we wandered next door to Tokyo Stop.

I love these little places--very small, but low overhead means lower prices, and less of a chance that the place will go out of business. We were there for lunch, and the place was super busy, but the owner treated everyone like they were a VIP customer. 

The food was good--I had the Katsu Bowl, while my wife and stepson had different types of noodles (can't recall exactly what now...this was a few days ago). Anyway, everything was good--not great--but good, and especially good for the price. 

Again, this is a very non-fancy, family run, very small, very friendly, inexpensive, decent place for lunch. Try it out next time you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good food! I enjoyed my meal! I arrived close to their closing, however, the service is still great!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Me and my coworkers eat here at least once a week..  Super fast, awesome food, and great service. The owner is so friendly and I'm pretty sure he never leaves, like, ever. A tip: get here early if you want California rolls, they run out toward the end of the day."}
{"text":"great service great food 
there's no doubt  that its one of the best place for quick lunch takeout. 
amount of food they served compare to its price was worth spending. 

 i highly recommend for those  who are living in asu area because the store is located right next to school campus. 

come check it out you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Japanese fast food (but Korean owner I think so Bulgogi on the menu is an added plus). Big portions. Very fast. Super friendly owner/cashier. Modest space. It is what it is. One star better than Kyoto Bowl if that helps orient you folks who like Japanese fast food. Also - super authentic Japanese chicken curry (brown meat if that matters) - not always easy to find in the Valley."}
{"text":"This place has gotten some mixed reviewed and I can see why. Many family owned restaurants don't uphold a high level of cleanliness or level of customer service. I've been coming here for the past 8 years and this place has gone through only 1 owner. The taste of their dishes remained the same which is why I keep coming back. I'm a huge fan of their chicken Yakisoba, Curry chicken, and lunch box combos. They grill chicken over flames and has a nice char taste.  

During lunch hour this place does get packed and seating is very limited so come before noon  on weekdays if you want to sit down. When it comes to Asian food, some people are bias because they get a taste of something wonderful in the past and that's all they compare it to. If it doesn't taste similar,it's mediocre. Every restaurant has their own styles. This place is good home-cooking that's consistent in quality and taste."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much from it but wow was I surprised! Very good orange chicken though different from what you'd expect if you've eaten random places. Sushi is so-so but I only tried my friends as it wasn't what I ordered. She was pleased with her curry and tonkatsu."}
{"text":"I go here twice a month. I love how welcoming they are. I've been to Japan and am very Asian-food-savvy. This place passes my test. The only they could improve is the cleanliness. The curb appeal needs work. Other than that, their food is perfect each time I order. The portions are also more than I expect."}
{"text":"I feel like Ron Burgundy as he bashes frozen yogurt for trying to be anything like his beloved ice cream and tries to give it zero stars. In this case, how dare you call your \"chicken katsu\" .... chicken katsu. 

I've been craving chicken katsu for days and saw this place during my errands. To keep it short, when you order chicken katsu you will not get chicken katsu, not even close. You will instead get barely fried/soft pieces of chicken (think teriyaki chicken); not even the right breading nor the right part of the chicken they usually use. Also, they will give you Katsu sauce, but it's really hoisin sauce. I thought all of this was a horrible mistake, but that's how they do things there. Talk about confusing and misleading, I feel like I ordered a hamburger and got a fish filet instead."}
{"text":"When I'm in the office, I love to grab lunch at this spot - basic chicken katsu with rice, OMG... Very simple dish, but they do it so well! Chicken is definitely crispy and tastes great (in my opinion)! I still need to try their other dishes, but I'm just hooked on the katsu, so that's my quick go to. I suggest just going for the large option since you get nearly double the size of a small for about 2 bucks more.

I'm writing this especially because I just got some chicken katsu from Yogi's Grill - wasn't expecting it to be better, but dude..... yogi's doesn't even compare to Tokyo Stop AT ALL... TS, maybe one of the best fast Asian food places in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"This is a great quick lunch spot. It's small on the inside with only a handful of tables so I always get it to go. I'm a fan of the Chili Chicken or Teriyaki Chicken. The portions are large and flavorful. The service is fast and friendly. I haven't tried some of their other menu items which I'm not sure how authentic everything is, but it works for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food with massive servings. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this place. Service is spectacular as well."}
