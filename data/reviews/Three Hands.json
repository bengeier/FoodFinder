{"text":"I have only come here for drinks so far, but the atmosphere was great. Staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly. There was a DJ that night and the music was great. Apparently, it was their first night with a DJ and I think it worked. Cocktails were good prices and tasty. I definitely have to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Honest delicious food prepared with fresh, quality ingredients and great local beers! Tip: the watermelon fried chicken is INSANELY GOOD and so popular, make sure you come early in case it sells out!"}
{"text":"I dropped in during the DundasWest street festival  and loved it.  My boyfriend had the jerk chicken breast salad. I was expecting something mediocre, but this one blew me away. The chicken was uber tender and the tomatoes were so fresh and colourful. I had the pulled jerk pork, again very tender. Great flavours that you never tire of tasting.   Service was really friendly. They were still trying to find their rhythm, but that's normal for an opening day.   Loved it. Can't wait to go back to taste their full menu."}
{"text":"As most of my reviews go I like to focus on the place as a whole.  For starters, I never heard of the place until I met the owner. He is a well rounded and friendly individual, which can be seen in how he approaches his food selection and interior design. The menu is a mix of comfort food meets Toronto culture/cuisine. It is a nice fusion!   In terms of location, ambiance, food, and service, here is what I thought:  Location - considering the ample amount of street parking and the streetcars passing by every 15 minutes or so, the location is very convenient and easily accessible.   Ambiance - the location gives a very relaxed and friendly vibe. The attire is casual and the interior design is well put together and welcoming to all. It has sufficient lighting and music to make the experience a memorable one.   Food - I ordered three dishes and glass of red wine. I ordered Jerked Octopus salad, Collard Green poutine (vegetarian option) and the kale salad.   1) Jerked octopus - was very tasty. The jerk flavor was the right amount and the octopus, which is typically very hard to cook properly, was really well done. I was impressed because the last few experience with grilled octopus was disappointing because it came out rubbery and overdone. For sure this place knows how to prepare a great grilled octopus. I recommend it if you like this kind of seafood.  2) Collard Green Poutine- I had no idea what to expect but what I knew going in is that I grew up eating and loving collard greens and poutine so combining them would probably be a good thing. It was. I recommend. The flavors of the collards and poutine all complemented one another very well.   3) Kale Salad - YUM! just order it and eat it. The caesar-type dressing, which I had to ask for some to go, was well made. The kale is fresh and the fried capers, grilled grapes, and parmesan cheese really make a good combination. Thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  Hope this review helps you out."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Thursday night to celebrate my birthday. The food was great but pretty standard (we had the jerk chips, salt and vinegar Brussels sprouts, Bok choy slaw, and fried chicken) but the cocktails were OUTSTANDING. My Old Fashioned literally blew me away, what a treat.   Service was super friendly and prompt and the music was great."}
{"text":"Great service, great music and delicious food. What more can you ask for?  Between 2, we ordered the octopus salad, jerk wings, curry mussels and collard green poutine - they were all so friggin' good and great portion size.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Sunday night, and was comfortably busy. We ordered the salt and vinegar Brussels sprouts, Collard Green Poutine and the Fried Chicken which was so good! It is a very nice spot for comfort food and to really kick back. Service was very nice, it really is family run. It has a trendy cool vibe to it, but you can tell the heart and soul is into this place. I'm excited to see what other new items that will be introduced on the menu in the months to come. It has only been open for just over half a year, so far so good."}
{"text":"Ok, so I read all the 5 star reviews and got suspicious, thinking \"they have their friends write reviews to bump up the average\".  Then I ate there, became a friend, and am writing them a 5 star review, so maybe I was right!  That is to say that the only thing that matches the quality of food is the personable nature of the Three Hands who operate this establishment.  A family run business, they feel very down to earth and accessible and the food.... Oh, if I could spell food with 4 or 5 o's, like foooood, it would be fitting in this case.  I had the best burger I remember having, the octopus salad was scrumptious and I'm the last guy to trust a tentacle to taste good.  It's melt in your mouth and flavourful.  The salt/vinegar brussel sprouts had the folks across the pond in Brussels cheering.... the truffle fries were fantastic, and the fried chicken was fantastic too!  Literally every dish on the table was a 4.5 or 5.  Incredible food.  At certain times of the night you can see light emanating from the kitchen, sparks flying out from it, thunder and lightening shaking the establishment and old, half-forgotten chants being sung as the chef works his magic in the back.  I think the burgers are made from unicorn meat.  Anyway, it was a magical night with really, really, really, good food.  Thanks Three Hands!  TIP: If you visit, walk with a trophy.  You will want to leave it for the chef and staff.  Just my two cents."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier to live next door to this place. Their menu items are unique and delicious - my husband and I have tried almost everything on their menu. We're always bringing our friends here who are continually impressed. The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable and groovy. PS: the death mango wings are H O T!!"}
{"text":"Super sad 3 stars because my first experience here was much better than the last! Split the brussel sprouts with a friend and they were pretty good but nothing above and beyond what I've had at other restaurants. I was deciding between the jerk wings and the jerk octopus salad and went with the octopus. It was cooked fine, but it literally had no flavour - definitely not jerk, but no other seasoning or spices that I could discern. It was served with shredded greens, orange slices and some type of yogurt, all of which were extremely bland. Maybe it was an off night? I was really disappointed in it to the point where I thought about sending it back, but felt bad as I know it's a small family-run place. I ate it, was still hungry after and ended up grabbing a shawarma on the way home. Not ideal. Cocktail was good (dark and stormy). Seems like wine isn't their thing (only one type of VQA red/white available) which I didn't love - it'd be nice if there was at least 4-5 different types available for non-beer people. Hesitant to go back based on the above, but could have just been a miss in the kitchen that night. My friend really liked his fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I came hear for the food and I was not disappointed. We had the collard green poutine 10/10, the breaded olives 9/10, and the surprisingly delicious salt and vinegar brussel sprouts 8/10.  I would definitely come back for the food. As for drinks, decent beer selection. Mostly Hopcity but still decent. The waitress, who was working alone.  Made a point to say she was not a bartender. So off menu cocktails may not fly and the menu cocktails were few and not that great. That said her service was amazing. Super nice. If they did some work on their cocktail offering and had a trainer bartender this place would be an all round great place."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was amazing and the level of spice - Awesome. This place was a bit pricey and the wait was long for the food. Otherwise  a great experience. We went on a Saturday night and it was packed. Thankfully we made reservations which I'd recommend doing.  Deep Fried Olives: If you're a sauce lover like me this came with an amazing sauce!  Octopus Salad: cooked to perfection and filling! This was a decent sized portion.   Double Burger: The beef melts in your mouth and this has a lot of taste to it but man it is a HUGE burger. Had a hard time taking a bite out of it.   Had a drink and for the life of me can't remember the name!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks. Only one server present but he was very quick, efficient and kind. The Brussels sprouts and poutine were delicious. Chill atmosphere that's nice for a low key night"}
{"text":"Went here early in the evening for dinner  It. was. so. good! Each item we ordered had SO much flavour. We got:  - Octopus salad (amazing)  - Beef short ribs (definitely enough for 2 people)  - Fried chicken (3 pieces) with watermelon wasabi  - Jerk wings (this was spicy!)  All in all with a beer and a wine this cost $100. Probably would have been best to get 3 items between 2 people. All in all it was 100% worth it.  Perfect to meet with a friend or your boyfriend! Haven't gone later in the night for drinks but I would try it."}
{"text":"This was one of our first stops while visiting Toronto & it set our trip off right. We found Three Hands with the help of Yelp! and I was a little suspicious when I walked into a mostly empty bar (around 9pm). It was a small space and there were a few solo diners. We sat at the bar & found the bartender/only server present to be very friendly and helpful.  The menu was very small and eclectic, focusing on comfort foods. You can tell they put a lot of love and thought into the few options available. We had the collard greens poutine and jerk wings. The poutine was INCREDIBLE. It was like thanksgiving dinner over French fries. I will likely think about this dish for a long time when I remember my time in Toronto. The jerk wings were so.freaking.spicy!! I wish we had been warned. The wings were served with sliced scotch bonnet peppers on top and I dug right in.... To have my lips screaming. I love spicy food, but this was painful. We picked off the peppers and tried to enjoy the rest of the wings. The flavor was on point otherwise. They offer canned beer (tallboys) and cocktails. The Pimms Cup was absolutely delicious. It was also very beautiful, garnished with julienned cucumber & sliced strawberries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Three Hands is one of my faves in the neighborhood! Tasty dishes and strong cocktails, with a warm, comfortable room and genuinely nice people... And sometimes they have live jazz flute, I'm not even joking! Seriously, Three Hands is the real deal, it has a friendly authenticity that you can't fake. And the food is fabulous - the wasabi fried chicken with watermelon, the ribs, the brussel sprouts, the wings are all ridiculously good. What I really love is the mussels and fries, I dream about those mussels - yum. The collard green poutine is also awesome. Cocktails are great, and prices are really reasonable. I've even brought kiddos here, it's that kinda place that can be perfect for families early in the evening, date night at prime time, and serious drinking late night. It's all sooo good, go check it out!"}
{"text":"We were directed here by a lovely bartender at the Lockhart because we were starved and in need of food but it was after midnight and we were visitors from out of town so we had no idea of where to go.  Firstly, they serve food till 2am!!! Life saver:)  So we ordered the Special(Jerk chicken sandwich with a Red Stripe for $16) it was delicious!! I mean finger licking good.    Then there was the vibe which was super chill and down to earth. The DJ was playing some sweet tunes, and they had a great family feel to it.    Plus we were blessed to be there to see some very talented beat boxers throw down on the mic.  Jaw dropping good.  To top that off they had a little dance off.  Lastly, the bartenders there were awesome!! Thank you both so much for your kindness, helpful advice and genuine fun demeanor!   I can't say enough amazing stuff about this place and we were only there for an hour."}
{"text":"Why serve $10 wine in plastic cup? I confuse  Painting of American men I do not know? Also confuse  Handwritten menu? Please put some effort! I felt like at child birthday party!   No thank you."}
{"text":"Stayed at excellent Air B&B nearby and walked over on hopes the YELPers before us were not exaggerating. What a treasure, not only spectacular food and drink, but excellent vibe with live flutist playing fab music. Don't miss this little gem!"}
{"text":"So we were wandering up and down Dundas at the tail end of this year's Dundas West Fest and all the vendors were shutting down, thus foiling our attempts to find something delicious to eat. We happened to find ourselves in front of Three Hands and as we made our way inside, we were told that it was the business' very first night in existence.  It was definitely a party atmosphere inside, and we were told that service might be slow. Undaunted (and hungry), we went ahead and ordered the Moule Frites and Deep Fried Olives (which were two of the only things left on the menu).  (I should mention that service wasn't at all slow and that the food arrived surprisingly quickly.)  The Deep Fried Olives (crispy olives, roasted pepper + pistachio romesco) were an unexpectedly delicious delight. I was anticipated something battered to oblivion, but what we got was a small, sparingly-battered appetizer that benefited from a thoroughly tasty dipping sauce. I could've munched on these things all night.  The Moule Frites (white wine mussels, crispy parm fries) were far more exciting and delicious. I'd never sampled this classic Belgian dish and now I can hardly envision it being done better. The parmesan-crusted french fries were just about perfectly done and the mussels were equally yummy. And, as if that weren't enough, the bottom of the bowl contained this scrumptious broth that I literally drank when all the food was gone.  Three Hands is a very cool, very small hole in the wall that certainly exceeded any expectations I might've had."}
{"text":"My sister, cousin and I usually try to test out new restaurants at least once a month - but we keep finding ourselves back here! The menu changes slightly every now and then, which is such a plus because we love trying new menu items. I'd recommend trying everything on the menu - my favourites were the fried chicken, mussel fries, the burger (it's like a Big Mac but 1000000 times better), and brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighbourhood and we've been going to all the restaurants in the area.  This one has been by far the best.  It's the food that has blown all of the others out of the water.   I had the ribs (making my mouth water just thinking of it again) and my boyfriend had the fried chicken, also a beautiful surprise to look at and to eat.  I'll go back for sure. So awesome."}
{"text":"Fried Brussels sprouts are delicious. The beer selection is okay but looks like they're growing there. Good specials and very good cocktails. Not usually busy until 9pm."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing, food is even better.  Best place for fried chicken & watermelon in the city, as it's paired together in a way that actually WORKS instead of as a gimmick (the watermelon is incorporated in the glaze on the chicken - I KNOW).  My favourites on the menu are the collard green poutine, the salt & vinegar brussel sprouts and the black bean pork ribs.  Serious melts-in-your-mouth goodness.  If you're also feeling brave, I'd suggest the death mango chicken wings.  You might need some moral support and a couple pitchers of water to hold your hand through it, but it's a pleasure worth the pain.  Trust me, you can't go wrong eating anything off of this menu.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm so grateful for this place.   It has such a chill atmosphere with great service. We've never had to worry about not finding a table and the food here is top notch.   The collard poutine is to die for! Also recommend the brussel sprouts and octopus! They also made a mean fried chicken.   The drinks are high quality too... I just can't say enough.   This place is good, guys. REALLY good."}
{"text":"Everything here is super flavourful and it's kind of a mixture of Caribbean flavours with everything else. Cocktails were great but when it comes to food, you can't turn down their Octopus, Brussels Sprouts, Fried Chicken and Bone Marrow."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Their fried chicken is the best in the city! We go all the time and highly recommend it. Kitchen is open till 2am and is great for late night eats! Cool atmosphere and the greatest staff and service!!!!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the neighborhood with an innovative menu and good cocktails. Beer is stocked with Ontario beer tall boys, and the interior has this cool almost tiki kinda vibe. Fried chicken And watermelon in the same dish is a little weird... for a few reasons, but whatever. I wish these guys huge success in the neighborhood. We really need a place where the kitchen is open late, has great drinks, and friendly service."}
{"text":"I've tried every menu item. They're all amazing. My go tos are the watermelon fried chicken and the collard green poutine. Also the cocktails have an incredible attention to detail to them. Perfect every time."}
{"text":"Just like everybody says. Great food, great vibe and Taryn makes one hell of an old fashioned"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. We ordered almost everything on the menu and were not disappointed. Poutine, fried chicken and burger were all favourties."}
{"text":"Very friendly neighborhood bar with a nice food menu.  I had the Collard Green Poutine, and it was *very* good."}
