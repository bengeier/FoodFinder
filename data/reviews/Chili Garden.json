{"text":"Please STOP & READ THIS before you anywhere near this place.   I just paid nearly 50 bucks for deep fried shrimp (starter), half a peking duck and all the pancakes etc that came with, and BBQ pork fried rice.   Let me start with the starter - the deep fried shrimp. Imagine a corn dog. Now imagine instead of a sausage inside, it's a teeny tiny shrimp. Yep, they are about 95% deep fried flour balls the size of a small man's fist, with a shrimp in the middle. I hacked and peeled away the coating to reveal the shrimp but was so disgusted by the grease oozing out that I couldn't even eat the poor crustacean. There were 8 of these and they went STRAIGHT INTO THE TRASH.  Next, I opened my Peking Duck, only it wasn't Peking Duck. It was a roasted duck breast, that had been reheated. None of the spices and special cooking you need with a duck breast for it to be called 'Peking Duck'. Just a handful of fatty, reheated, greasy, grey duck breast slices. I thought, maybe it's not so bad. So I built a pancake with the hoisin sauce (watered down), added the cucumber and lettuce (flaccid and actually some were dirty) and gave it a go. I immediately gagged, and had to spit it out. It was horrifically bad.  I threw it away but decided to give some of the duck meat to my dog - he's a Lab and will eat anything - EVEN MY DOG REFUSED TO EAT THIS MEAT.  So, despondent, I turned to my BBQ pork rice. It looked OK. I had the tiniest of bowls and had to stop. I can't quite put my finger on what's so offensive about it. Perhaps it's just the taste of grease. Perhaps it's the overwhelming texture of rubber. Perhaps it's the fact it's got hard, uncooked peas in it. I don't know. Take you're pick.  THIS IS NOW IN MY TRASH.    THE ENTIRE MEAL, EVERYTHING, IS IN THE TRASH.   In all my life I can't recall ever having a worse meal with absolutely nothing to redeem it. I've lived all over the world and had some strange and funky meals, believe me, but every one of those meals had something - however small  - that you could point to. Something like - \"well that octopus and goat stew wasn't very nice, but at least the rice was edible.\"  At the Chilli Garden - NOTHING WAS EDIBLE. I'M FIFTY BUCKS DOWN, STILL HUNGRY, AND CONSIDERING TAKING MY TRASH CAN AND POURING IT THROUGH THE LETTERBOX OF THE RESTAURANT. That's a joke by the way, cos that's illegal. I wouldn't give them the satisfaction of screwing me twice.  EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE. ANYWHERE ELSE.   GO HUNGRY EVEN, YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME SENSATION AS HAVING VISITED THE CHILLI GARDEN BUT BE 50 BUCKS RICHER."}
