{"text":"The best Indian food I had in Toronto. Specially butter chicken and Samoisa. Must have it with the butter naan. Bread is made fresh at the time of order.  It is always empty because they opend recently but the food is so great. I have been here so many time after."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Restaurant has just recently opened. The buffet didn't have a huge selection but we ordered of the menu. The lamb vindaloo was outstanding. Portion was too large to finish so now it's lunch for tomorrow. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to in Canada. It brought me back to my trip to India where every meal was the best meal I've ever eaten. This is the only place that has ever tasted the same. You can tell that the chef really cares about food, and flavour. As a small group of four we sampled a variety of choices from the menu. The lentil soup was apparently simple and delicious. The onion and vegetable pakoras were amazing with two choices of chutney (both so delicious)! I ordered a samosa and was so excited to see 8 mini samosas come out so we could share :) I ordered the mutter paneer with saffron rice and garlic naan. Everyone who tried mine said it was the best, I'm so glad I chose it. My partner got the Kadhai paneer and it was very tasty. Our friends ordered the vindalou and butter chicken with roti. They exclaimed it was definitely the best butter chicken they've ever eaten. The food definitely sold us all and we will always be fans. Each of us ordered the medium spice as we are spice lovers -- this was the perfect amount and we will definitely do the same the next time we come. The next best thing is the price -- the prices were beyond reasonable. We ordered way more than we could eat and paid less than 60 per couple. The service was great. The staff were friendly and attentive. The restaurant was packed! We will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I have never been to the actual restaurant, but we order food from there all the time using skipthedishes.com. Very good Indian food, probably the best in our area. Our favorites dishes are chicken pakora, chicken hariyali and amritsari shrimp for appetizers, and lamb shahi korma,  goat curry, and shrimp masala for mains."}
{"text":"I have been to this place dozens of time.  I absolutely love it.    I also often order food to-go for dinner.  For an Indian restaurant that is not advertised as Hakka, they make a surprisingly good number of Chinese style foods.  My favorites are their vegetarian spring rolls and vegetarian noodles.  My wife loves their samosa.  In each order they give you lots of tiny somosa (same with spring rolls).  Their tandoori chicken is also really amazing.  Today we also got the tandoori grill mix, lamb vindaloo (a stew of lamb and potatoes in a delicious sauce), and garlic naan.  All were absolutely excellent.    Be warned: when you ask for your food to be \"spicy\", it comes out quite spicy (which is how we like it).  Even \"medium\" has a bit of a kick.  The guy who makes the food is super nice and very skilled.  Their lunch buffet is totally worth it and it costs $11.  For the buffet they usually have butter chicken, tandoori chicken + 2 to 3 more main dishes, rice, and a few appetizers.  The chef also brings fresh buttered naan to the table as part of the buffet."}
{"text":"10/10 quality and service. We ordered the paneer tikka masala, methi malai mutter and dal tadka with jeera rice and butter naan. Naan was very delicate and tasty and jeera rice was cooked well. All the curries were we ordered were very tasty and especially the methi malai mutter... it was incredible! Found a gem in the city. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"There buffet menu selection is very poor only a few items, when I asked them if I can just buy a portion of palak paneer separate instead they insisted I wait until 3 and the buffet was over. I ended up just leaving hungry and without anything. I recommend trying other places if you want a decent item selection"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great family. Amazing service. The lamb is so succulent and well marinated. It is nothing like a typical Indian restaurant. The naan is freshly made. Food takes a little longer to arrive because it is all made fresh on the spot. Just amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a location u would never expect ... industrial area ! ... The food was very delicious, we loved it!. If you are dining there then wait time can be long ! .... but food was worth it. Methi chicken, goat curry awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, for take out and delivery. And I have to say this is the best Indian food I have ever had. And the price you pay for the amount you get is unlike anywhere else. From the samosas to the tikka masala everything is awesome. The chef is unbelievable and very friendly, every time I have dined in he has always come out to see how the food was. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food for a fair price. Had Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Korma, and an eggplant dish that wife liked with rice and naan. Only suggestions for restaurant is they should put some centerpieces on tables to make it more cozy. Also, I think waiter was a family member without much waitering experience.  However all in all I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I read good reviews about this new restaurant, so I finally decided to give it a try.  First thing you'll notice is that it's not that easy to find.  It's located within industrial units but the sign is large enough that you shouldn't miss it.  I decided to give the lunch buffet a try to assess the food quality.  Although the buffet price of $10.99 is quite reasonable, the selection is quite small. Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, goat curry and 3 vegetable dishes.  They also provide some chow mein noodles and tiny samosas that didn't look too appetizing.  They also offer a salad oddly presented in a Tupperware container and rice pudding in a pot that was actually quite tasty!  As for the food quality, the tastes were great!  The tandoori chicken was moist and flavorful, the vegetable dishes were great. I even loved the butter chicken which I usually avoid but this one was flavored beautifully.  If the buffet tastes this good, I can can only assume that ordering off the menu would taste even better.  But there are some low points.  For one thing, they consistently don't offer raita.  The chef said hardly anyone orders it so they rarely make it.  Other than that the food quality and taste are excellent! I highly recommend the fish tikka, the Chana and the eggplant dishes. All are amazing.  They are very few Indian choices in Woodbridge and Maple but this one is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of shady from the outside. It's in a dimly lit mini strip plaza. But inside it's brightly lit with about 12 tables. The food was pretty good. I'm not sure I know what legit Indian food taste like but I liked it. The bf and I ordered butter chicken and chicken shahi korma with 3 sides of garlic naan. The garlic naan was a little on the oily side but I think it was needed for the aromaticness of the garlic.  Only 4 stars though because service was on the slow side and took awhile for the waitress to even come get our order. I also had to ask for water around 15-20 minutes after sitting down. They're also definitely not in a rush to clear off tables. When we sat down the 2 tables beside us we're still full of dirty dishes from the previous patrons. But aside from that, the food was delish. The bf and I both agree we would be back to try other dishes. :)"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough, The Spice Room is one of those places that serve comfort food that is gratifying for the soul. We've dined in and ordered Tandoori Chicken as a starter, then Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, and Palak Paneer with Naan (Garlic and Butter), as well as rice as the main event. The curry was dynamic in flavour profile, where you taste distinct elements that harmoniously come into one, which is key for Indian food. Many times, the use of many spices blend into one boring note. This was not the case. The setting is quite inviting, warm, quaint but not \"old\" in any sense. Service is excellent, where you are taken care of by a husband and wife team. Yes, this is a family restaurant, and it adds to the charm.   Also try the masala tea at the end, it is a delightful finish to a wonderful meal.   There is more to add, but why not try for yourself. The price point is more than reasonable if you done a la carte, and much more if you do buffet.   Did I mention that everything is made in-house, or so it seems? Even the mint and tamarind chutney are made from scratch, which is a rarity for a restaurant serving food at these prices.   If you want one of the best Indian food in the GTA, you must eat here."}
{"text":"We used the Skip the Dishes app to order delivery from The Spice Room, first time eating here, and man was it impressive.  I can't speak to the in-house dining experience but the food that showed up on our doorstep was fantastic. It took a while to get there (65 mins, exactly as predicted in the app, so they were upfront about it) but when it did it was piping hot and packaged in a really smart way.  We had the Bharta (my usual go-to, it was tasty), the chicken tikka masala (incredible), some plain basmati rice, and some onion naan.  All of it was really good, fresh, not too oily, and full of quality ingredients. The spice level was perfect for us too.  The onion naan was out of this world,  I would order again just for that.  I look forward to ordering here again, the food was just as good the next day as leftovers out of the fridge."}
{"text":"We were hesitant on the first look but after trying it out we were pleased. Excellent food and warm and hospitable service. They also have a lot of variety and the goat curry was delicious."}
