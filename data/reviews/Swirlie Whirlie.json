{"text":"I don't live particularly close to Swirlie Whirlie, and I stay away from dessert-type foods for the most part, so for those of you like me, it's a great alternative to ice cream shops, and really worth the trip. Delicious, healthier fun food"}
{"text":"Fro-yo is one of my favorite desserts and although Swirlie Whirlie delivers, there's plenty of better places closer to Pittsburgh. I do, however, like the pretzel menu they offer. 

What I liked: Huge selection of toppings. Offers soft pretzels. Cute decor. Daily specials. A tv that plays movies (to keep the kiddos quiet). Organized instructions for where the yogurt line starts. There are frozen yogurt containers available to-go. 

What I didn't like: Not a huge selection of yogurt flavors. No original tart flavor (my favorite). There's only one size cup. 

Self-serve fro-yo places are all mostly the same. This one is different because it has other snack offerings. It's definitely a cute place and a good neighborhood ice cream alternative!"}
{"text":"Good yogurt, fresh toppings, VERY CLEAN and excellent customer service from staff and owner. Had the cake batter and peanut butter yogurt....sooooo good!!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Toppings are always fresh way more to choose from than your average fro yo place staff is friendly place is clean and neat. More of mom and pop type place."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite froyo place in town! The workers are so welcoming and polite. There is a variety of yogurt options to choose from and the toppings are amazing."}
{"text":"Well-run self-serve frozen yogurt shop.  It seems there are these places popping up everywhere, and not all of them are well maintained or friendly, but Swirlie Whirlie is always clean, well stocked and friendly.  Definitely recommend."}
