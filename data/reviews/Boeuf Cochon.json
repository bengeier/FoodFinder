{"text":"Excellent choix pour une soiree d'anniversaire!  Beau menu, repas bien faits et genereux.  Nous etions un groupe de 15 et le service etait excellent: prompt et amical.  J'ai aussi apprecie le decor moderne et pas trop kitch :-) et les menus pour enfants. Nous y retournerions definitivement lors d'un prochain passage a St-J... Rien de negatif a signaler."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse. Excellent price-quality ratio. Interior decor is very nice. A pearl in St Jerome..."}
{"text":"Ii luv this place. Cozy, well decorated and nice breezy terrace. Food is always good. Neat customer service. Minus one star for the noise level on evening nights."}
{"text":"It's a nice American styled bar & grill.  It stands out from the usual restaurants around like St Hubert's and Scores. The décor is very modern and a nice vibe. Staff are very nice and the maître d even came by to ask us how the food was. They have a 5 à 7 where drinks are cheaper so that's always a great way to start dinner. Overall a pretty good experience and food quality."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience! Great service fantastic food will recommend for a romantic dinner or with friends place is amazing"}
{"text":"I had a great experience last night.  Warmly greeted by the manager, seated promptly.  I had my usual, a bone in rib eye.  Perfectly cooked.  My wait staff was fantastic.  Very attentive.  I will make sure to stop back in the next time I pass through town."}
{"text":"I am seriously impressed with this place. We were depressed about having to have a business meeting in St Jerome and even more depressed about having to eat there. We were all amazed at the quality of the food, wine and service. Congratulations for making me change my perception !!!! Thank you for providing a great food and drinks to the town."}
