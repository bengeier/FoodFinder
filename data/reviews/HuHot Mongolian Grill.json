{"text":"I love this place! The only catch is that you should know how to chose the ingredients and sauces to match your taste. You almost can't go wrong, but there is a lot of return to getting better at it. Like other things in life practice and experimentation makes perfect! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, add your own meat, veggies, and noodles! Everyone was ubber nice and the grill guy even flipped his spatulas like crazy!"}
{"text":"We walked in a little after 7 and stood aimlessly at the host stand for a minute or two before a passing waitress, looking very stressed, stopped and asked if we had been helped. She checked us in at 7:08. We then walked over to the bar to order a drink while we waited. This wait was in vain - we sat there until 7:22 watching servers comic and going, before we gave up and walked back over to the host stand. The manager asked us to move away from the doorway and offered us a seat at the bar, at which point I informed him no one had served us so we weren't interested in sitting at the bar any longer. He apologized and said they don't have a bar tender tonight. I suppose that means no one gets alcohol tonight - a Friday night? That's a lot of lost revenue. The first 20 min of being here and they're down to 2 stars.We were seated at 7:29, which is reasonable for a Friday - it did seem like they were short staffed. Our server was great and the food was yummy, so that gave them the 3rd star."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Me and my family drive an hour away just to come to Madison to get our crave. The staff is VERY nice, my daughter got sick there once from a headache & instead of freaking out & being disgusted out waiter was very helpful getting us water & towels & checked on us the whole time. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The selection is great. The price is crazy. And the service is mediocre at best. Although they do take food allergies seriously and will clean the grill upon your request which is a huge plus in my book since I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend has a seafood allergy."}
{"text":"How hot you ask? HUHOT. Huhot is the greatest thing since sliced bread."}
{"text":"I had my reservations when my wife raved about a Madison restaurant she and some friends visited.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The wait staff ( in our case, Joy ) was very helpful and attentive.  The schtick, you pick your own recipe from a large variety of fresh meats, vegetables and sauces ( some pretty exotic, like calamari, spicy sausage, tai noodles, tofu... ).   Upon giving it to your 'cook', it is stir fried on a large round Mongolian grill with an entertaining array of techniques.  The end effect is a nice stir fry of varying heat ( mild to spicy to tai/Szechuan ). Served with your choice of white or brown rice, this is an all-you-can-eat event that is sure to please. ( no doggy bags,, please ).  I had Japanese sencha to drink, I believe there were harder drinks available(?)  A fine array of appetizers and desserts are also available, but we were happy with the basic package.   We WILL return.  I highly recommend that you check it out."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. However waitresses were very unprofessional talking against the previous customer  next to my table laud. African American cook was rude and careless. He saw me with full plate didn't care to took it for cooking and acted like no body over there."}
{"text":"I'm only giving HuHot 3 stars because I am always unimpressed. There was a 30 minute wait this past Friday night (which is fine) so my boyfriend and I decided to wait at the bar. The entire 30 minutes we were sitting there no one bothered to say hello or ask if we needed anything. The people behind the bar completely ignored us and just hung out with each other with their back turned to us. The food is fine but the customer service tends to be lacking every time.   It's like we walked into someone's private party and no one wants us there."}
{"text":"Won't be dining here again.  The meant is like flash frozen, and once it's cooked it's like trying to chew rubber.  The only thing really selling this place is that it's all-you-can-eat.    I'd rather go to Flat Top, same dining experience (mongolian grill) better ingredients, better food.    I'd rather get full on good food, than fill myself with bad."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service at the table was fine. The individuals cooking at the grill were very unprofessional. The conversation they were having was distracting them from doing their job properly. It was frustrating watching them not focus on cooking the food. I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"They are very similar to Flat top grill in terms of concept but quality wise I think they fall well short especially for vegetarians. When we took our bowls and proceeded to adding noodles and vegetables, I noticed that most of their vegetables were frozen. Further they also put meat right there next to the vegetables. This can cause food contamination. Also their sauces do not have clear labels stating which ones contain meat or other allergens. Anyways we added vegetables, beans and sauces to our bowl and saw the food get cooked right in front of us. I am a vegetarian and it was not a pretty sight to see our food get cooked alongside meat on the same station. When I tasted the food, it seemed like the noodles and some veggies were not even cooked properly. Maybe Madison has pampered me in terms of vegetarian friendly restaurants but Huhot grill is not one."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for unlimited dinner ($14/ person) that included a side salad or soup, and it was a mediocre experience.  Right when we walked in, it took about 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us, which kinda puzzled me since there was no one ahead of us. Once seated, we then had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our serve to greet us. Although the service was a little spotty, the waitress was very kind.  The food was also average. I ordered the Asian Garden side salad. Because both my sister and I agreed that the lettuce could have been a bit more fresh and there could have been more dressing, but it was nice it came with the meal. The meat and vegetables were clearly frozen, instead of being at least semi-fresh which disappointed me a bit, but there were a wide variety of protein, veggies, and sauces. The sauce section was labeled clearly from mild sauces to the very spicy ones which I appreciated. My favorite toppings were the mussels, broccoli, baby corn, and the peanut sauce. I would recommend to always put a lot of sauce in your bowl because sauce is key to having a great meal here!   I would return to HuHot again, but I would not frequent here. It's not my favorite place in Madison due to the price for the quality, but the experience of \"making your own food\" is cool."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was absolutely terrible! I have been working in food service since I started college, and the service I had today was the worst I've seen. The waitresses were nowhere to be seen on the floor for over 20 minutes after we were seated, because they were sitting in a corner talking with each other. At one point, my mother was choking and coughing extremely hard in an attempt to breathe, and not only did no one come to check that she was okay, but I had to actually catch the waitress' attention just to get a glass of water for her. No one was attentive to their customers while we were there. I realize that HuHot is a chain where you put together your own food, but basic customer service is an essential component to any successful restaurant, regardless of the set-up. There is no excuse for the way we were treated today, and I may very well never come back."}
{"text":"It's really really bad and overpriced food. The worst place I ve tried in Champaign so far"}
{"text":"nothing really wrong with the food, nothing really good either. my biggest complaint is the price: $12.99 for dinner. included in the dinner price is your choice of soup; I chose the hot and sour. weirdest hot and sour I've ever had. it isn't that it tasted bad, but seemed like it was made by someone who had no idea what hot and sour soup was. it was mostly thin strips of carrots in a light broth. not a bad flavor, but not hot and not sour, that's for sure. the dinner was also supposed to include a greater selection of ingredients. I don't know if it did since I've never eaten there for lunch, but I saw shrimp and scallops listed on the website, and the only seafood present was some suspicious looking kind of whitefish. you also get to choose from pork, beef, sausages, everything frozen and hard as a rock. then, a small choice of noodles (3, I think) a good choice of veggies and a lot of sauces. now, here's my real problem with this place: it's basically a buffet, except nothing is cooked until you order it, and your only choices are noodle dishes. you get a fairly small bowl, put a few pieces of meat in it, then some noodles, then you've got room for a few veggies. then, choose your sauce and wait in line to hand it over to the cooks. avoid this place like the plague if they are even remotely busy. on a Saturday evening I had to stand in line waiting to fix up my bowl, as people just shuffle through line like zombies, then stand and wait to hand your bowl over to the cooks, then stand and wait until it is cooked. sit down and spend a few minutes eating, get back up and repeat the process. I spent more time standing in line than I did eating. and again, the food wasn't bad, but I think $7.99 is a fair price for what you get, $12.99 is criminal. a lot of good Chinese buffets charge around $10 for the dinner buffet, and many also include a Mongolian grill. it's not this big, but for less money they also include egg rolls, much better soup, salads, rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, pork dishes, sushi....you get the point. here, you get noodle bowls, that's it."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of controversy regarding the HuHot, let me try and explain why I understand both sides...no, actually there's nothing to understand--the general premise is that HuHot and most Mongolian Grills in general heap large/unlimited portions of bland uninspired food at you and expect you to be awed by the concept of a large stir-fry and wide array of ingredients.  To over-analyze it some, this premise if you can call it that is inherently flawed because at its core what makes a good restaurant is quality of ingredients, quality of preparation and service.  Service here basically is to explain the concept; so shakes out as largely a non-factor.  HuHot's ingredients are soooo bland, the meats are frozen and have no marinade or rub to them, the freezing of the vegetables results in the same end-result.   Supporters want to clamor that the sauces give flavor and you can choose whatever you like! (like you can't find something at a normal restaurant) But the sauces are just alright and merely an attempt to cover up the blandness problem.    HuHot is tolerable for where it is on the \"new\" west-side of Madison as it's a relatively quick n easy lunch spot for all the new offices out there.  And I'll admit I find their stereotypical Asian menu rather amusing.  But one could create a tastier stir-fry at home.  The Parthenon is one of man's greatest constructions but without any skill it's just a pile of rocks."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and children.   The food is good, but not spectacular.  The variety of sauces makes it possible to try out many different flavors.   The service was very good, the waitress was friendly and helpful.  The only real negative is the price.  My son is 3 years old so his was free (he didn't eat much anyway), so for my daughter, wife, and myself it was $60 not including the tip.    4 stars for the food & service, minus one for being overpriced."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly. Service is quick. Food is \"eh\".   My advice is use lots of sauce because the veggies and meats don't have much to offer."}
{"text":"This place has something to EVERYONE! Whether you area a simple meal person or something from lands of spices and intense flavors - you will find something here that will meet your palate.  The grill offers pre created recipe cards for those that wish to play safe and yet for creators and experimenters it has an array full of components to choose from! Almost like colors of foods and flavors on the canvas of the grill!! The guys at the grill are simple outstanding and show some superb tricks to entertain while you wait! The appetizers are pretty good to get started. And what's best is there are unlimited repeats - so whether u dont like something or absolutely love your creation, you can go in a second and a third and a nth time till you are comfortably full! They are open late so it works awesome for late nighters! It never fails to surprise me with a new taste each time!!  The flip sides: The recipe cards are sorta basic for people like me who love variety and layers of flavors The price is a bit on the higher side but for someone who can make multiple rounds, it is worth it I wish they had a single trip option for a lower price for people who dont eat that much The service on busy days is super slow - they seem to be way understaffed  I still go here and just plan around the cons to make it worth it!"}
{"text":"Been to this many times now and my daughter n I love it everytime we come here..we enjoying preparing all the by ourselves.. We can create our own dish according to our taste so I give 4.5/5 for the food. And 4.5/5 for the ambience  and 4/5 for the service."}
{"text":"Great staff but awful awful TERRIBLE food.  I really really wanted to enjoy this place. I really did. I went here last night with my daughter and boy were we disappointed. We ordered the all you can eat and it came with the choice of either soup or salad. I ordered the Hot and Sour soup and she ordered the Egg Drop and can I say YUCK!?!? By far the nastiest version of HSS I've ever tasted and boring bland tasting Egg Drop.  With such horrible soup we went on to try out their Mongolian grill. I will say this, they had a very nice selection. Large variety of meats and seafood and a great variety of vegetables. The sauces well... that's another story. It's obvious these are pre bought watered down tubs of sauces that did not say 'Mongolian' at all. Want to know whats even better? They give you a full view of their disgusting giant see through refrigerator with their bundles of horribly stored gross sauces right next to the grill. I was, however, very impressed with the cooks and how well they did. They cooked quickly and accurately. Props to them.  After or food was cooked no surprise at all. Disgusting. Now I'm sure you can say. Marlene, what if you're just terrible at picking the correct sauces? Well my dear yelpers, we took advantage of the 'all you can eat' and tried out many different combinations including their cheat card combinations. Nothing tasted nearly close to mongolian or at all appetizing.   At the end of the day I will never ever come back to such horrid tasting food. It's just too bad, they had a magnificent staff and very skilled cooks."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place, except that is is just plan okay. The food is not bad - I particularly like their spicy sausage - but it's not someplace I have ever craved. We've been twice, and we have no real intentions of going back ever, simply because there are better choices out there."}
{"text":"We have been to Hu Hot on many occasions, it was filling and reasonable at lunch time. Last month we visited and were seated next to the food bins. We notice one of the staff filling up the bins then patting down the vegetables with his bare hands. I thought it may have been a quick pat, but no he filled up most of the bins and used his bare hands to move the food around, even stopping to get more food from the fridge. We also noticed he had a band aid on one of his fingers. This was enough to cause us not to eat anymore. On the way out we did talk to the manager and he just said that he should have been wearing gloves. The place is not that big and it was not that busy a manager should have noticed. I don't think we will go there again."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that even with the recommended sauces... I don't know what mixture of meats veggies, and so on will make an excellent dish here.  The experience is literally as good as you make it because you are after all selecting the ingredients to your dish."}
{"text":"My kids enjoy the variety and ability to mix things up with multiple trips to the grill.  I can mix up some good dishes for myself, though the meat and \"seafood\" leave something to be desired.  For a dinner buffet, I think it is a good place to take the family and have a decent range of options."}
{"text":"Had a great time, and what a fun concept.  Pretty classic mongolian grille fare (lots of proteins, vegies and a TON of sauce combinations) with a very friendly set of grill masters.  Took my 7 yr old son and he had sooo much fun putting together his own combination and watching them cook it in front of him.  Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I liked that I could customize my food. It seemed like a lot of money if you only fill one bowl, so bring your appetite. Do not get the egg drop soup! I liked that my waitress explained the process and recommeded 5 to 6 ladles of sauces. I stuck with mild and was very pleased. My friend's dish was too hot, and she had to go back and try again. She was very disappointed to find that they only have seafood options on certain days. I think they said Tuesday and Thursday. Call ahead!"}
{"text":"Ahh I was so excited because I love Mongolian grills but this place was really bad. I don't know how to describe it, no matter how much sauce we put on our food it just didn't taste like anything. But somehow it still tasted bad? And the grill wasn't hot enough, you could tell by the way all the food was sitting there like a lifeless lump so the vegetables were still kind of raw and none of flavors really cooked in. It was just awful. Easily the worst dining experience I've ever had in my three years in Madison. Also the chefs were kind of angry and unfriendly. The atmosphere was just super depressing."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, this is not Mongolian!   My husband and I were on the west side and decided to get some dinner. Unfortunately the Pho place was closed so we decided to stop in here (not doing research first) with the thought that we have not had Mongolian cuisine in a long time. Well, we were fooled, it is an all you can eat, make your own stirfry chain. There are plenty of options which was nice, but it did take us a second trip to get a sense of the flavors/heat of their sauces. Needless to say, I doubt I will be coming back unless my only options are other chains, but Madison has much better options for the price."}
{"text":"Great place for stir fry. But I was seriously disappointed by the seafood selection. Basically it's imitation crabmeat. Was here about 4 years ago and they had all u can eat shrimp and shark meat. To miss out on my shrimp is just plain old buyers remorse. So many choices. Could've found a better place than this. SMH"}
{"text":"Great place and I like it very much. Everything is good and you only need to figure out what sauce you need. I usually have two or three plates of food each time. Try pineapple and mango and teriyaki: awesome! The only problem is that the huhot and sour soup is too salty."}
{"text":"I tried HuHat again and was impressed this second time around. I will definitely be going back! I need to learn to pace myself when I fill the bowl the first time around so that I have am hungry enough to go back for seconds. There are so many stir fry options to choose from."}
{"text":"Filthy. Food and debris everywhere. The food was sub par. Service was poor. We had to flag down our waiter each time. All but one street light in the parking lot was burned out. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Unhygienic,  unclean and expensive for a bad version of chipotle. Everyone's food is cooked on same horrible looking big hot plate using same set of spatulas. Allergens, meat sauces from other's food spreads into yours."}
{"text":"While the staff were courteous and helpful, I ended up with food poisoning that night and for 2 days after.  When we called the restaurant and talked to the manager and asked that they not serve the fish or mussels until they could be checked, they said that that would not be possible and would be serving them anyways.  STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The cooks are amazing on the grill.  I have just one suggestion.  Don't sit near the grill.  The air circulation makes it so sitting ANYWHERE near the grill means you will freeze the entire time.  I went for my birthday, they were out of Sake and I was freezing to death, which meant my food got cold really fast...but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place just opened in Chambana and I wanted to try it out. My family has visited one out in CO, so when we heard there was one closer to us, we jumped at the chance to go. This place is so fun and such an experience! If you've never visited before, your waiter will explain everything to you and take your drink order. After that, you go up to the grill area and load up one bowl with your desired meats, veggies, and sauces (all frozen or raw). Try different combos with the sauces to get your preferred flavor combo :)  Once you have filled your bowl, you turn to the grill area and take your place in line around the circular station. They'll take your bowl and you will follow it around as you watch it being cooked. It literally only takes a few minutes for everything to cook through and it's tossed into a new, fresh bowl for you to eat. You then carry it back to your table.  The meats available were chicken, pork, and beef. They also had tofu for all you vegetarians. Tons of veggie selections and also some fun additions like crab and pineapple.  It's so enjoyable to watch your food being cooked and to see them cook 10 others at the same time and keep everything straight - definitely an art!"}
{"text":"Food is OK. Too expensive for what you get. It is a liitle more reasonable during weekday lunch."}
{"text":"NOT FOR VEGETARIANS!!! I have been eating at Ho Hot for several years now. As a vegetarian I liked that they had a lot of veggies and tofu available and they would ask if we were vegetarian. When we said yes the server told us to make sure to tell the grill people and they would clean it and use different utensils. The other day we went their and I noticed their menu had changed so I glanced over it. I noticed that each sauce was now marked if it was vegetarian. Only 2 sauces were marked out of the 20 or so they have to choose from. What's worse is that none were marked before so I had assumed they all were and had been eating them in the past. Now I feel lied to and ill. And really only 2 sauces?!?   I WONT BE BACK AND I AM NOT HAPPY!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! This is probably one of the most spectacular eating experiences I have ever had. Ok, first things first. Location is OK but not great. It is in an odd spot between Middleton and Madison but is also near some other places to eat like a Panera and a nicer sit-down restaurant. I have been here quite a few times and everyone is always really nice and SUPER fast with anything we need like more drinks etc. It's affordable, fast, and delicious. The best thing about it? Technically the only person to mess up your food is yourself. I mean I have received the wrong plate and in my opinion something could have been cooked a little more but otherwise GREAT.   The cooks are VERY very efficient and always put on a great show! The building itself is very modern and trendy with some great lighting inside and a nice relaxing exterior. The parking is technically in back and the \"front door\" is on the street so it would be nice to have the door at the... errr... back? where parking is?... um yeah... Anyways, I love coming here for an interesting eating experience because every visit is different from the last. I highly recommend at least eating here once just to see what its like."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 3 stars.   I've been here for dinner twice - on a Friday and a Saturday. Saturday dinner was pretty busy, but service and quality stayed reliably at a high standard.   Service staff was very nice and prompt. They're usually very visible and attentive. They will refill your drinks quickly. A head waiter/manager type of person came around to check up on customers - which is always a good sign.  The food was pretty good, too. I'm not expecting the best cuts of lean meats here. The meat you pick was frozen as expected - and that is fine. It's stirfry, frozen is fine. I did wish the meat was sliced thinner by the supplier. But for what it was - it was good. Though they're missing out on an offering of lamb, they did have the other types of proteins usually included in a Mongolian grill. So the ingredient bar is good enough. They have 20 sauces ready for your choosing. I know what I liked in my stirfry, but they offer sauce recipes to help you out.   * They actively try to keep the ingredient bar as clean as possible. During busy times it gets a little disarrayed - but it's not like cleaning staff are ignoring their duties. They clean and refill the food often.  The grill itself is run in as efficient manner as one can imagine when grilling an entire restaurant's meals. Be forewarned that when it gets busy you can have a line of 10 ppl waiting to put their raw ingredients in with the grill. Bring a friend to talk to or a phone! Though the food quality was pretty good at the end, one problem is that the cooking time is too long - usually to cook through the meat. Since they are not adding some sort of liquid (a salty broth would be nice) during the cooking process, the starches just start overcooking and a lot of it gets stuck on the grill. This affect is really visible when the grill is at full capacity and only 3-4 chefs are working. A positive is that they won't bother to give you the burned noodle parts. The chefs, though young like from college, were very polite and seemed to have a lot of fun grilling. So they're doing a pretty good job.   * There's reviews mentioning that when chefs lose their spatulas to the floor, they'll re-use it. .... ???? That sounds preposterous. They are surrounded by 15 customers watching them cook their food. Anyways I actively checked every time a utensil fell to the floor to see where they ended up. The end up in the dirty dishes bin.   * Spatulas ARE re-used for working between different customers' foods. I think that is fine. They scrape the spatulas between customers, at least. This does mean if you have any food allergies you need to make sure to mention it. AFAIK they have a system for this since the wait staff do ask if you have food allergies before you go up.   The food was yummy when I ate it.    They have those 100 flavor soda machines so their drink selection is full of variety. Every time I asked to change flavors the waiter was prompt to get it.  Is $13 for this dinner buffet a smart choice? Yes. I cook sometimes and I eat out sometimes. Cooking up a stirfry is going to be cheaper, but sometimes you're lazy. If you're lazy, you're going to eat out. I've tried so many places in West Madison. You're putting in at least $10 anywhere else just for an entree. I think HuHot is the best value for my money if I'm looking for a good sitr-fry and I'm ready to eat to my heart's content. All the staff so far have been very polite - and it was a great experience to come out having my stir-fry cravings fulfilled.  I hope their service continues at the level I've experienced.  Fun stuff: A great sauce mix: Soy sauce, garlic, chili garlic sauce, chili oil.   Simple but delicious in your mouth."}
{"text":"For the first round, I found it super tasty. But second? Not so much.. maybe it's because I was full.. price is a bit  high though"}
{"text":"This was not a great experience.  Came here because we had a coupon that saved us $20 and we wanted to try it.  First of all you could tell they were short staffed after walking in the door and seeing all of the empty tables that needed cleaned.  We were seated after the host went to go clean a table off for us.  It took a little bit for a waitress to greet us and get our drink order which was another sign they didn't have enough help. When we went up to get our food several of the items were out and the ones that weren't had a mixture of several items since people are generally messy.  Unfortunately there wasn't much cleaning going on with the veggie and sauce bar. The sauces were a mess and not appetizing at all.  The worst part for me was watching the food get cooked. The grill was gross. The catch tray around it was full of all of the runoff and when they were cleaning between plates they would splatter all of the water/crud all over the grill even if there was a plate being grilled. I basically lost my appetite when I saw the floor and all of the water/food/grease that they were slipping and sliding on.  The other thing that bothered me was the potential for cross contamination.  They use the same spatulas to stir each person's plate as they walk around the grill.  With all of the raw meat (especially chicken) there's not really any way to be sure everything is sanitary.  Another reviewer noted they had stomach issues after eating here.  I did too.  Sorry if that's TMI, but it makes you wonder.  On top of all of that this place is EXPENSIVE.  For us 4 it was $60 including the tip. That was after the $20 discount we had so if you don't have a coupon brace yourself when you get the bill."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a Saturday at lunchtime when they were not busy, and again on a Saturday at dinner time when they were moderately busy, and both times I had service so poor it was unbelievable. On my second visit, after we waited so long for silverware that our food got cold, I asked for a manager and she was rude and condescending. This was after we didn't get our drinks and our appetizer came out 35 minutes after we ordered it, and it was cold.  The food itself is of good quality and the concept of choosing your food and watching them make it is neat, but the service was so terrible I would never go back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love HuHot!  The service is not always prompt, but it is most definitely friendly.  Today, though, our server George was both prompt and friendly.  He was also knowledgeable about the rewards program and informed us of what we needed to know.  While I do enjoy the food, I am sometimes slightly put off by the fact that most of the meat and some of the veggies on the food bar is frozen (though I am sure there are reasons)....  Obviously I get over it by the time I'm back at my table and ready to eat; so, it's not a huge issue.  The sauces are delicious (my favorite is the peanut sauce.  YUM!).  We enjoy the little tricks the cooks do to entertain us while we wait for our food to cook.  The cooks are always polite and friendly, as well."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place from the start. But my gut feeling was right. Mostly because I loved Flattop grill. Sadly, its has closed now. Naturally I was comparing this place to Flattop so I may have some bias. The waitress wasn't too clear with the instructions (even though it wasn't hard to figure out) she didn't offer waters either. Now the most important part, the food. The only good part of HuHot is that they have a lot of toppings..the toppings didn't exactly make too much sense. It had like corn and black beans, jalapeños...etc. The meat (chicken, beef, etc) were all thin and frozen. I was used to fresh chicken and meat so it was off putting. You also had to lather up your bowl with sauce or you don't have any flavor to the food. The chefs had real skill which was interesting to watch but over all I would never come here again. It wasn't quality food, wasn't adequate wait staff, not a good experience. I wouldn't waste your time or money here.  As an update, my stomach hurts now, which leads me to believe the food wasn't cooked correctly.. Again the chicken was frozen when you pick it out."}
{"text":"Walking in, I had no idea what we were getting in for.   It turns out that you pile meats, vegetables, nuts, fruits, and sauces from an extensive buffet line into a small bowl for the \"chefs\" who will fry it all up for you. Chicken, scallops, pork, beef, zucchini, carrots, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, asparagus, mushrooms, onions, mandarin oranges, pineapple, garbanzo beans, and a WHOLE lot more are available for the choosing. Plus over 30 sauces are available for mixing and matching.   When first approaching the stack of bowls, I noticed that they were all soiled. Icky! Not my idea of a good first impression. While satisfied with the choices, I found myself going back to my favorite standbys each time I filled a new bowl. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat.  The Cooking Method: Dudes take your bowl, slop it onto a large rotating flat grill (consistently too close to my neighbors pile, I might mention), and flip them until \"finished\". Meanwhile I'm waiting for my food to cook, I see significant pieces of my ingredients falling into the catch basin while they are being flipped. Dang! I wanted that piece of chicken in there!  I must admit that the crab rangoon were mighty tasty. My mom longed for shrimp, which they apparently only serve during dinner. They did, however, send out a funnel cake dessert to celebrate my mother's birthday which was nice.   BREAKDOWN: The food was ok. I like the idea of make-your-own stirfry. Atmosphere was way too corporate. Decent prices at lunch. Skived out by the messiness of the whole thing.   I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE WITH FOOD ALLERGIES!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a lot of (20+) coworkers. Got seated right away and waitress explained how the lunch buffet works since most of us had never been there. A lot of ingredient and sauce choices. The wait for the cooking was okay considering how many people went at the same time. The chefs were very efficient and friendly. Restaurant also looked very clean. Will def go back again."}
{"text":"I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience.   To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win.   As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty.   We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us.   A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas.   Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot.   Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.  Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for?   This was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"While the food wasn't bad, this place just isn't what I remember. It feels cheap and well, sad.   There was a decent selection of food to put in your bowl, but the meat was frozen and the seafood was a little off-putting. However, I decided to try a little krab meat and pile on a ton of different veggies. While I felt like I ladled on a ton of sauce, after my food was done being prepared, it was dry and pretty tasteless. I followed one of the pre-made recipe cards so I thought I would have been safe, but guess not. While I was certainly full after one plate, I just wish there was a little more to it.   Our waiter George was super friendly and attentive. He was prompt on refills and good at clearing the table. It was pretty slow, but he seemed to be able to keep himself busy.   Glad we had a coupon otherwise I would have been a little disappointed. Probably won't be back any time soon, but I was with good company so it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I always appreciate grill-top restaurants (especially Hu Hot), but the experience was terrible. Our server was inattentive and dinner took about an hour and a half. We had to ask to get waters, then drinks, then salad and soup. It seemed to be too much to even ask questions about the menu.  Also, far too many staff walking around, hanging out, and chatting loudly throughout the restaurant. Didn't help that we got sick that night, too.  Terribly unimpressed."}
{"text":"I went in with a bad attitude since I read a lot of negative reviews.. It was pretty good. The service was meh but the huge amount of options, Veggies, meats, sauces were impressive.  The frozen meat was a bit surprising but I guess it makes sense rather than having warm raw meat sit out. Who cares if it is authentic based on the name? McDonalds isn't authentic Scottish food.  I have to say, though, the grill guys weren't very friendly, and the server kept calling me honey, so that was annoying."}
{"text":"A bit expensive for \"fast-ish\" food, but I thought the selections were good, the place was clean and it was a good experience.  Now, we were there at 1:30p on a Monday.  I am sure that helped with many aspects of enjoying the experience!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times.  If you like Mongolian this is a great place.  Drinks were good, service excellent, and the food selection area - which is important to me - was very clean!  HuHot keeps the meats frozen so raw juices do not get all over the place.  That is VERY smart.   Their selection is huge, and the sauces plentiful and good.  Last time we went my vegtarian frined was worried, but they cleaned a space on the grill stone, cooked her meal in a vegetarian pan, and used separate spatulas, so this place is vegetarian friendly.   Both times, good meals.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I do not write restaurant reviews. I am too busy to take time. However, this restaurant deserves some recognition. First, the service was unbelievable. We have a large family (8 kids) and they were so willing to accommodate our younger children with little treats at no extra charge. They did everything they could to make it an enjoyable experience. Second, the food. Wow. It is so good!  I've recommended this place to a number of people that do not typically go for Asian food and they loved it too!  Affordable price for all you can eat. You must go!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good. And prices were majorly over priced. There was not an option to just get one plate.  Kids plate was $4.99. Went back for a couple more pieces of meat and got charged for a whole new plate for him.  . Had I known I was getting charged for 2 plates for my tiny 6 year old I would have loaded them up.  Service was slow and had to wait to have drinks refilled. Servers were at the welcome station chatting and not checking on customers.   The owner was terrific. Talked to my son and introduced himself. He was the only reason I gave this 1 star. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food, decent and expected prices. Great selection in the buffet and it's fun to watch them cook. Excellent sauces.   Tip: Don't get the egg drop soup. Most vile thing I've tasted in a long time. Smells and tastes spoiled. Server commented it's not popular which leads me to believe it wasn't just this night."}
{"text":"Before the rest of this, I must disclaim that in general all-you-can-eat restaurants aren't for me. Eating responsibly doesn't usually go well with eating from an unlimited quantity. For this restaurant, the quality did not suffer. All the meat, vegetables, noodles, and sauces were delicious. Their hottest sauce is the hottest article I've found in Madison, though I don't really have much experience with the hot wings market here. Sadly, every time I've eaten the complementary soup, it hasn't paired well with the food. Either eat it first or order the salad, I guess. Also the line to have your food grilled can get a little long at times, though it's not so terrible as long as you've already eaten your first serving. I guess there's another reason to eat the soup/salad first..."}
{"text":"I went in to the new location in Champaign, IL for Mother's Day. Mostly because I had a free birthday meal and a free appetizer coupon. I'm a broke college kid and just wanted to spoil my mom without spending a fortune. I wanted to make sure that I could use both coupons on one order so I checked the email and it didn't say anywhere on either of the coupons \"NOT VALID WITH ANY OTHER OFFER\" which is what I was looking for. So I figured it would be okay. I even asked the server if I could do that and he said \"I don't see why not\" so I ordered the appetizer and all 3 (my mom, boyfriend, and myself) got grill meals. The check came out to almost $60 without coupons. So I asked to have them redeemed and my waiter then changed the story \"oh I'm sorry you can't redeem both on the same ticket\" so then I asked if we could split the ticket to get both coupons. She went and asked her manager and came back and said \"no we can't do that\". I didn't raise hell because it was Mother's Day and I didn't want to disturb everyone else in the restaurant but i am VERY annoyed that this happened and I had to pay $10 more than what I should have because the waiter wouldn't stop trying to convince us to get the most expensive appetizer! The food wasn't even that great, definitely not worth $15 per person."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff was very nice and helpful, let's get that straight. And the bottomless bowls were a bonus. BUT the friendliness of the workers cannot make up for the lack flavor in this establishment, sorry John, but smiles can only take you so far. Not only was the food mediocre at best, but if you have any sort of food allergy, this place would be a living hell because of cross contamination. In addition, the decorations covering the walls are down right disrespectful to Mongolian people. Overall, would not recommend and could find more authentic food at Panda Express."}
{"text":"Fresh veges and wonderful meat, if you like noodles, don't order the rice.  You order rice before you go to put your food together."}
{"text":"If you go there, I suggest skipping on the fish. I chose to put crab and pollock in my stir fry and have never been more sick. Ate my meal at about 6:30, had an uneasy stomach for the rest of the evening, woke up at 4:30 in the morning with horrible stomach pain and nausea. That was the only meal of the day to cause me to feel that way. Horribly disappointed as the service was otherwise great, minus being a little slow but that was because of the dinner rush. Will not be returning as I have no desire to risk repeating that experience again, which is a shame because I really wanted those cheesecake rangoons..."}
{"text":"Wow. I forgot I ate here for a friend's birthday party once because Flat Top was busy - its that memorable. The bartender didn't know how to make certain standard drinks and they didn't have a drink menu. The wait staff was ok. When you walked up to pick your items for stir-fry, it felt like you were picking things from a trough. The cooks looked miserable - the way it was set up reminded me of a pirate movie where they are chained to a circular pole and had to walk around in circles, and the floor was disgusting and they had to push all the water off the floor to the drain - yucko. The sauce/condiment area at the end of the line was a bit confusing. Overall, the food didn't taste like anything. It was pretty tasteless - usually tofu picks up something from the sauce, but not here. I would have been better off just grabbing a bowl of uncooked tofu and seasoning it with the soy sauce. The table next to us were a bunch of chicks and one of them even pulled down her pants to show off her thong. Terrible dinner and a worse free show? I love (not - its sad really because this place is soooo far from Asian food - it's like the Taco Bell of stir-fry) that they have the stereotypical Asian guy with a Fu Manchu beard as their mascot."}
{"text":"Good food selection and a hell of a lot cleaner than most \"Mongolian\" BBQ places. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Usually I really enjoy my visits, but unfortunately this time I did not.  My father-in-law took my wife and I out for my birthday dinner and HuHot was my choice.  Even though the drive was a hour each way, I thought it would be worth it.  We got there at about 5:00 pm.  We were seated right away, but instead of putting us at a table that could fit 5 people, we were put at a booth/chair table meant to seat 4.  The server then just grabbed a chair and put at the end of the table.  Other than that our service was good.  The waitress made sure to stop by every once and a while and make sure we were doing ok.  When I went up to the meat/veggies is where things really went downhill.  All of the meat, veggies and sauces needed to be refilled.  There were no pad-thai noodles and they were out of chicken and beef.  There didn't seem to be anyone that was in charge of making sure things were full.  The veggies were hit or miss and there were several sauces that were almost gone.  There were also veggies and sauce ALL OVER the counters and the floor.  It looked like they had just served a bus load of hungry football players and didn't bother to clean anything up.    While we were there it started to get busy and they got backed up on the grill, they seemed understaffed in the kitchen and over staffed in the dining room.  All in all, I know they can do better at HuHot, I just wish their off day wouldn't have been a birthday celebration with family."}
{"text":"Good location, terrible parking.   There are many options to choose from.  The food stations were clean but the sauce station was a disaster. Random drip drops every which way. ...maybe it's time to adventure into the unknown sauce mixture. I'm being positive about a messy situation.   The cooks are quick. I'm not 100% about anyone with allergies coming to this type of restaurant. I would look into that before venturing.   THANKS GEORGE!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Had a coupon for buy 1 get one 1/2 off which was a good deal for all you can eat. Many options and fun staff. I love this place and wish it was closer to me. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Great meat selection and love the noodles."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a cheap but still pretty good dinner. It was my first time here, but the server let us know how things work and it was nice to see recipe ideas at the start of the line. I picked up a couple ones and actually liked it. I didn't get a chance to be creative with the sauces, but my wife did and I had a taste of it. There's not really a long wait for your food to cook even though it was a Friday night. We plan to come back again."}
{"text":"It's my first time yesterday to eat and experience that kind of restaurant. It was a nice experience! I do love watching those guy how they make our noodle they are very entertaining. I just feel bad about the taste of my noodles I put too much teriyaki sauce lol! It's my fault I know. I'll come back there next week and try something new. Im from the Philippines, and It's my 2nd month of staying here at Wisconsin. I can say that it's my 2nd favorite restaurant here at WI :) I also like the server, they are all nice specially the server named \"DON\" we took picture of him coz he look very nice and he didn't refuse us to take pictures of him even though it look creepy coz someone wants to take a picture with him specially we're a customer, and even he's busy.  Please tell him to keep smiling coz he really have a nice smile and attractive dimples :) I cant wait to go there again and meet him again Lol!!!"}
{"text":"HuHot is one of the best restaurants I have found in Madison since we moved.  I went to several different Mongolian Grill restaurants for years.  Some of them limit the portion by giving ridiculously small bowls or food get far overcooked to charcoal status by inexperienced grillers and lots of other problems.  However, since I have been to this place and with every visit, HuHot has been very reasonably priced as well as always have food perfectly grilled.  I will definitely go back to this place many many times."}
{"text":"I was not impressed and would not go back. Both times I got my grill bowls, both were not cooked long enough. The food was warm, the mushrooms still light grey color, the onions and bell peppers still hard, and the meat was grey color. It should be sizzling hot and have a golden color. I did observe the cook and see that many patron's food was cooked correctly. But once it got down to the last 2-3 dishes she would rush and put them all on plates without them being cooked properly. Since I've gone to a Mongolian Grill in Naperville and one in Bolingbrook, I may be spoiled and my standards too high. This place did not have the eggs or shrimp choices like the two places I've gone to. They were out of clean utensils. My fiance and I waited about 8 minutes for clean utensils. I barely ate any of it, just the noodles.  I did not ask for it to be cooked longer. I was just too disappointed and wanted to leave. They ran out of the yellow noodles as well. I asked if they could bring out more. However, I was told they literally had no more for the day. I also did not receive my water nor did we get napkins. The waiter apologized that he was not more attentive. He said the reason was that it was so busy. I couldn't help look around at all the empty tables. It was only about half full. The sauces were good. It just wasn't that great only eating noodles because that's the only item I felt safe eating."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch yesterday and was greeted by the hostess.  I was seated right away but almost banged my head on the overhead light because the tables aren't aligned properly.  The hanging light was directly over my chair.  After five minutes, my server still hadn't appeared, so I just went up and proceeded to fill my bowl with my grill products.   They have A LOT of different options.... beef, chicken, sausage, pollack, tofu, meatballs, krab (with a k not a c), etc.   Tons of veggies and noodles (three different kinds).   The sauces, oh my gosh, tons of them.  By the time you get to this part, your bowl is overflowing (mine was piled high with spinach, sprouts, cabbage, carrots, chinese noodles, tofu and chicken) and they suggest that you ladle on SIX scoops to get adequate flavor.... you have to be careful, otherwise the sauce dribbles all over the place off of your mountain of food.... I successfully ladled on the 6 and made sure everything went into the bowl.  I chose a green curry with some sesame oil. Then you bring it to the grill and they stirfry it for you.   I came back to my table and finally my server comes over.  He was very nice and super apologetic for not being there sooner.  He suggested I download the app for the restaurant and I would get a free appetizer.  I was a little disappointed that all the appetizers were some sort of deep fried concoction, but I chose egg rolls.   They came out super hot and crunchy -- they were very good, but I do wish that they came in \"single person portions\" (one would've been perfect) as opposed to \"shareable\" which was 4 or 7.   They also had the option of krab rangoons.  But anyways, the stiryfry was very good.  Six ladles of sauce was perfect.... everything was cooked through and I had no complaints.   It also comes with a side of rice if you want some extra carbs.   Apparently it's all you can eat.... but 1 serving and egg rolls was plenty.   For a mongolian barbeque restaurant, I didn't see one mongolian working here, but then again, it doesn't seem very authentic....it's just a different spin on Flat Top Grill.   It's a good addition to the chain restaurant rich area of North Prospect....   for a $9.99 lunch, it was a good deal.... I'm not sure how dinner would be any different, but there is a bit of a markup for dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here during a weekend trip to the dells and we both thought it was fantastic. Being a little more health conscious of what I eat when eating out, I loved the flexibility of choosing what went into the making of my meal. You're able to choose how little or how much sauce you wanted and it was all you can eat, so if you wanted more veggies in one dish or more meat in another you could! We arrived towards the tail end of the dinner rush so I was worried about having to wait, but we got seated right away and the cooks did a great job working to get the food out quickly. I loved how energetic they were, joking with the guests and each other, it's awesome to see people loving their job. I would definitely recommend this place to families looking for a different fun dining experience, or people looking for a healthier Asian inspired meal choice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love HuHot!  I love the choices for sauces and basically any bowl you create is your own unique creation, no one to blame except yourself if its not excellent.  And if that's the case, just go for a different bowl, they're unlimited!  My favorite sauce is Kahn's revenge, its very spicy and it really hits the spot.  My only criticism is the meat, the frozen pieces are a little skimpy, but after a few times, I've figured out how to best maximize the meats.  All in all I look forward to going here often!"}
{"text":"I liked the choices of food and sauces. The cooks were great, the waiter kind of forgot about us, brought me white rice when I asked for brown. When I was getting a plate cooked I saw he had a plate too so I guess we were interupting he dinner with ours. It was fun going up to make another concoction of food."}
{"text":"I ate here just once, and that will be my only visit.   I was looking for a low-priced, quick meal, and HuHot was the answer. Unfortunately, the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the restaurant as well as the chatty gang of bored wait staff next to my booth during my visit were both such turnoffs that I don't want to return for a second visit.  My husband and I sat at a booth near the bar, and when sitting down, I smelled something like dirty socks. I don't know if old food was rotting in tiny cracks in the seat, or if bacteria over time in the carpeting underneath the booth caused the smell, or if the smell was generating from something else. Whatever it was, the smell was one that should not be inside of a restaurant.   The bathrooms smelled a little like sewage. The handles on some of the utensils at the buffet were sticky. Overall, the place just was not clean. (I'm turning my nose up as I'm typing this!)  Our server was fine. She was friendly and attentive. But why did the rest of the HuHot wait staff sit around and chit-chat in the bar area during the 45+ minutes that I was there? I understand that I was dining at an off time (3pm), but I still feel that the wait staff ganging together and \"hanging out\" in front of customers is very unprofessional.  All in all, my experience at HuHot unfortunately was not positive, and I am not planning on going back."}
{"text":"I had a wonder experience at this location. A gentleman named Juan at this restaurant is one of a kind. He talks about and treats the business as if he was the owner. I would recommend my friends and family to this location based off of the quality and friendliness of the staff."}
{"text":"While reviewing this place I had to keep in mind it is relatively new and hasn't been open a long time so maybe they're still working out issues. With that being said I would be lying if I told you I wasn't disappointed. I was so excited to try this finally. Let's start with the food, your meal comes with soup or salad so my girl and I both got the Asian salad. Wasn't anything too fancy but tasty for what it was, no complaints with the salad. Next we ordered crab Rangoon for an appetizer. They came our relatively quickly, although they tasted as if they'd been cooked in advance and had sad under a heating lamp for some time. Lost the crunch had more a chewy feel. The quality of the products on the stir fry line was okay not the greatest but not the worst. The \"Asian\" meatballs just kinda tasted like meatballs. But some positives, all the sauces I tried were amazing, in particular the peanut based sauce was my favorite. I also really enjoyed the large selection of veggies. This is also an \"all you can eat\" which is wonderful. The service is where this place lost most of their stars. My particular waitress was soooo kind and helpful. The woman working the hostess desk came next to our table about halfway through the meal and plugged her phone into an outlet to charge and set it on the floor RIGHT next to our table... then came back and sent multiple text messages still plugged in RIGHT next to us. Not acceptable, at all. Might give it a second chance, worth a try."}
{"text":"You try so hard, but Hu Hot - I'm just not that into you...   Your sauces have no flavor. Some of your food is fresh, some isn't. Your branding is pretty cheesy. The seafood is poor quality. Just not loving it.  The people seem nice, but unfortunately that just won't cut it.  For my chain Mongolian bbq fix, I'm sticking with Flat Top."}
{"text":"The way hut hot works is very cool. You fill up a bowl with raw ingredients, add your own sauce, and then you hand it to the guys behind the grill and they make it up for you right before your eyes! Its unlimited, so if you don't like what you make you can try something new or go back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a couple of years ago and didn't care for it.   Well we went back again and were once again disappointed.   The service was horrible. We didn't get our drinks right away, nor did we get refills when needed. It took forever to get our check.   The food was ok but the service really ruined the whole experience for us."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with HuHot.  Hadn't gone in quite a while but came back a few months ago and it has become a regular favorite.    Improvements have been in the area of service (used to be slow - no more), cooking line (used to be MUCH slower - hasn't been a problem and we went at busy times).  They have a decent selection of veggies, recipes, protein - I like the addition of the mussels and sometimes shrimp (instead of the mussels).  Some of the sauces also seem to have more flavor and not just bite which I think some restaurant's make that mistake.  Some people in our party are vegetarians and we tell the cook on the line - they make sure they don't mix up meats with their veggies and use separate spatulas to do the cooking - impressed!!  I have been here recently as a party of 1, party of 10 and everything in between - was decent/great each time!"}
{"text":"This place is always an awesome choice as far as buffets go. Love the sauces and meat options especially.  The only downsides are that the service is pretty subpar and the puny bowls of rice are never enough for my plate."}
{"text":"We just ate there today at about 5pm, and it wasn't extraordinarily busy.  It was my second time there; my wife's first. I'm a Mongolian fan; I've eaten at probably 20 different Mongolian places around the country. The food was OK. Not bad, not great. The biggest miss to me was not having any shrimp available at all. The other thing that I didn't like was that all the meat was frozen. This is a nice trick to save money - if the meats are all frozen, you can't put as much into your bowl, so they save money. As a result, I left still hungry. And, compared to other Mongolian places I've eaten at, this isn't cheap. I think it was $13 each just for the food. We spent $41 for two people, including the tip, and just drank Coke. The atmosphere was OK; it's a nice place, but my wife like's Flat Top's atmosphere better. (We've eaten there too, and the thing that I don't like about THAT place is that you don't make your own bowl [so you don't get much meat] - which is why I like Mongolian in the first place). The service at HuHot was fine, the food was cooked well. We'll probably go back some day, but it's not at the top of my list. Unfortunately, neither of Madison's two Mongolian places are even in the top half of my Mongolian restaurant experiences."}
{"text":"Now granted I'm opposed to the idea of Mongolian grills in the first place for the usual reasons, but at least with Flat Top nothing is frozen, it's nice inside, and if you go up a few times it's a good deal (well, for lunch at least). The whole ambiance of HuHot just felt trashy."}
{"text":"This could be a fun experience if it cost less than half of what it currently costs. We paid $37 for two unlimited dinner bowls, which came with a soup or salad. Any appetizers or dessert would have been extra. The food is unremarkable, as good as you make it, I guess. However think about what you can get for $37 at Golden Harbor or KoFusion or Golden Chimney, and you probably will end up with leftovers!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Mongolian grills being from CA and I thought this place wasn't too bad. Granted, it's the only one I've tried here in WI.   Seating on a Friday night was plentiful, even though groups of people were coming in. The selections of protein were simple, but I wished they had shrimp. The vegetable selections were great. I liked the recipes above the sauces and tried one of them, which turned out to be deeeelicious. There's also little recipe cards at the start of the buffet line in case you don't know what to put in your bowl.   It wasn't bad for $14, so we'll likely find our way back here for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"This place is awesome all you can eat. Dont limit you to one small bowl to grill. Lots of good ingredients reasonably price. Great staff and excellent t service and freshness!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the diversity (having mussels as an option), our server, Steven, was a very good man and was attentive, and the grill food is amazingly delicious!  I could say less of two things: the soup is not that great, and the music was too loud when we came in (Friday at 5 PM), so we asked to turn it down twice.   But the grill food is amazing! If they ask you \"soup or salad\" (if you get the grill, you get white rice and soup or salad), please say \"salad\"."}
{"text":"Took my brother and husband here, because they both love these types of places, and they can get their money's worth with the refillable plates for one price, which is $12 a person.  We went at lunchtime on a weekend, so there was a line at the grill, but they did a good job of moving people along, giving the food plenty of time to cook, and remembering whose dish was whose. The manager also thanked us for dining with them.  One weird thing was that they were out of almost all of their soda flavors, and they boast a ton on the menu (they have a menu JUST for soda flavors). We were also told they don't serve cream soda, even though it's on the menu -- another little oddity.  Our waitress was very upbeat and friendly and informed us that we could get a free appetizer if we signed up for their app to earn discounts and such. My husband decided to put the app on his phone, I ordered some crab rangoon (very tasty), and when the bill came, she told him to put the promo code for the free app on the receipt and she would comp the appetizer. The change I received was for the total on the bill including the appetizer. When I asked her about it, she assured me that the appetizer had been removed and then also said something about the ice cream for the float my brother had gotten. So I asked to see a final receipt, which seemed to irk her. She didn't come back with one but talked to an associate for a few minutes before walking over and handing me $6 to reimburse me for the crab rangoon. It was really bizarre, and she wasn't so friendly then.   Overall, food is decent, restaurant is nicely spaced, and we had good service, up until the dispute about the bill. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Clean, efficient and local take on Mongolian grill concept. Food was kept cold and organized until you get it and have it cooked. The stone was hot, the cooks organized and efficient, and the servers friendly. We were in and out during the lunch rush which was impressive and the price was great and more than fair for an all you can eat style concept. Liked the healthy options and ability to cater to all sorts of people in a picky party since you choose your own food. Remember dine in doesn't get boxed up to go, only menu ordered items can get boxed to go if I recall."}
{"text":"Service slow. Menu choices very limited. Crab Rangoon sub par. Chicken teriyaki salad meh."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location but it was great. Some have said expensive not really for what you get. Yes soda is steep at any restaurant but drink water folks or don't gripe! Our waitress was helpful and friendly. Our food was very good and you could get all you want. The trick is to combine the sauces and use lots of them. I used 10 full ladles full. $12.95 for all you want is very reasonable. Wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"As a BIG lover of Mongolian BBQ I was very skeptical of a place this big trying to do it. However, this place was amazing. They have a huge selection of things to add into your food which is great. The meat selection was anything special but they had all the basics. They do put the noodles at the front of the line as compared to most places where you put them on last. My guess is that this is to fill your bowl faster so that you don't take as much...but after everything cooks it reduces down so much you typically want more. BUT it is all you can eat so it isn't the end of the world (if you really could go back for more that is...i'm always too full). The cooks do a great job of cleaning off the grill in between plates which is a huge relief for people (like myself) with food allergies.   Also this place is very kid-friendly. When we got our highchair our server told us that it rolls and that we should take our little one with us through the line. At first we were a little uneasy about it, but after doing it, it was awesome! People in line complimented us on our ingenuity which we in turn attributed to the server.  We didn't try it, but I would definitely think hard about getting their Smores desert they have. Comes with a flame in the middle and Marshmellows, chocolate and Graham Crackers. Make Smores at a restaurant table? Brilliant!  At the end of the day what separates this Mongolian BBQ apart from the rest is the huge selection of sauces. I'm used to seeing several, but this place has way more than any other place i've ever been. Only complaint about the sauces is that the hot wasn't that hot. But then again, no hot sauce ever is. My one complaint...it is a bit pricy at $13 a person. It could be worse, but still...a bit high."}
{"text":"I took my guy out for dinner at HuHot tonight, and had to come home and write a review. The place was pretty full, but we got through the cooking line very quickly, and the chefs were extremely attentive and friendly (they cheerfully sang happy birthday to a girl in line, and they actually appeared to be enjoying it--which was charming).  Now the food here is good, and the best part is, you can choose EXACTLY what you want in your meal, from the meats, to the veggies, noodles, and sauces (and there is a VERY large selection). The meats remain frozen at the buffet, which makes me feel much better about food safety. The sauces are really tasty, and I love that you have complete control as to the ratio of everything on your plate.  *Pro tip: I like to just go through the line once with two bowls. Saves time!  ;)  Now, for the real reason I had to rush home to write this review: When our server, Michael (he was tall and had a nice, mild manner), came to take our bill, he noticed that I had laid down a USAA card. He went out of his way to ask if either of us had been in the military. My boyfriend is US Army retired, and Michael went ahead and knocked a percentage off of my bill. He didn't have to do that - he'd simply noticed my military card (which I have because my father is a vet, too), and asked. I was so impressed with that!  It's this outstanding service that's earned the 5 stars. The food here is good, the ambiance is that of a national chain, but the service was spot-on. Nice job, HuHot!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of the garbage all around.  Not a ton but enough to notice."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for Mongolian bbq. The pad Thai noodles, spicy sausage, and beef were great. Didn't love the Asian meatballs or other noodles. The mushrooms weren't cooked well and tasted raw. And unfortunately you will find plenty of ingredients where they shouldn't be, which is sort of inevitable with the trays being so close together. On a more positive note, our waiter was awesome and extremely attentive and they have tons of drink options. I was pleased overall."}
{"text":"I come to HuHot about once a month, usually when its a busy day and I haven't had lunch yet by mid-afternoon. This is a good spot for when you're in between and having one lunch and dinner makes sense.  While I am not a fan of buffet style restaurants, HuHot is different because of the myriad of fresh ingredients being prepared instantly hot on the grill. There are plenty of options for meat, noodles, veggies, and nonmeat proteins - chickpeas, black beans, tofu, and edamame - oh my!  The positives - kid friendly, customizable, options for everyone in your party. Vegetarians, those wanting something Asian or American, from meek n' mild to huhot heat level. Also food is cooked fresh before your eyes and that of your dining companions! No food dying in the window or entrees coming out at different times that destroy a dining experience.  Special mention to the S'mores dessert! They bring you a little \"fire pit\" and you assemble and roast them yourself over the fire!  I don't understand reviewers complaining about the food! If you aren't a master of tastes and textures to create your own stir fry, why not select from the dozen recipe cards available? Because you can go back through the line again, if at first you don't succeed, try again!  The negatives - While the dining area is HUGE, there is a consistent effort to seat guests in the back corner near the kitchen. Hosts/servers sit a party right next to another party with no regard for the dozens of available tables elsewhere. Over half the time I come here it is outside of lunch and dinner rush, so why not seat people around the restaurant? It is uncomfortable to pack everyone into 15% of the dining space. On my most recent visit last week I asked if we could get a booth when we were being led to the back corner. Response: the only booth left in the corner had a bad seat. How about the rest of the restaurant?!  I was offered a table in the middle next to another set of diners in the middle. The 15 inch buffer zone wasn't enough so we took the broken seat booth. The manager on duty needs to handle seating for awhile and train servers or hosts on how to distribute customers around the expansive dining area in a sensible way. Jamming everyone in the back corner doesn't look good and does not contribute to a positive dining experience! I have removed one star from the rating based on seating.  I agree with other reviewers who mention wait staff hanging around the bar instead of attentiveness to customers. (Joy & Amber are exceptions; they are good). I suspect there is no employee break room. Suggestion: make the dining corner back by the kitchen the employee break area! It can be a challenge to get a drink refill or used plates removed. I have removed one star from the rating based on a lack of server attentiveness, menu knowledge, and professionalism. Its a training issue.  I will edit the review and update the stars to a 4 or 5 level if these issues get resolved. I hope they do because there are positives here, but attention needs paid to improve the experience for myself and others from middle of the road to 5 stars before its too late!"}
{"text":"Not exactly sure how to rate this place, seeing how it depends on how well YOU make your meal.  HuHot is a lot like Flat Top Grill, meaning that it's a make-your-own \"stir-fry\"(although it's allegedly \"Mongolian\") joint. I think this place has a few more items and sauces for your dish, but it's very much like Flat Top.  I think this would be a great place to take kids and/or picky eaters, since everyone can get EXACTLY what they want.   Don't get the martini that looks like Windex, it's nasty...$7 worth of nastiness."}
{"text":"There's a Mongolian barbecue in Indianapolis that I absolutely love and used to go to quite often. When I moved to Madison my boyfriend assured me that this place was the bees knees. Alas, it is not. The sauce is average and their barbecue is quite bland. The meat is dry and tough. The fish and seafood are terrible. The veggies are what you would expect. The staff is amazing! The grillers are usually entertaining and Joy, my favorite waitress, is such a peach. I keep getting dragged back here, but I never enjoy the food much. They have a freestyle Coke machine, so that's pretty neat. The BEST part about this place is the cheesecake rangoon. It's usually the bribe that gets me to go. Every restaurant should put it on their menu."}
{"text":"Never any major complaints here... I recommend it to anyone willing to put together their own plate.   Hint... always add wayyyyyyyyy more sauce than you think.... drown that food in liquid.  Occasionally the wait will get a bit long when waiting for the food.... usually this is because there is someone with an allergy and the large portion of the grill has to be cleared off and keep clear of other peoples food."}
{"text":"Came here with a huge group the other evening and we were promptly seated. The servers were great and we got started right away. This is the second Huhot I've been to and I didn't have high expectations since it is just a chain make-your-own creation buffet. That being said, I thought this place did a great job,  from the little show the chefs put on with plate balancing to the freshness of the options. There was a good stock of pork, beef, chicken, and imitation seafood. One piece of advice I would give is that to ensure you have a tasty plate, definitely do not skimp on the sauces. I would go with their recommendation of 5-6 ladles of sauce to really get the flavors in. All of the different sauce options are great and you can mix and match! Also, if you're not a big fan of continually trying new combinations and just want a meal, grab two bowls at a time -they'll throw them together for you. Overall a decent place I'd come back to."}
{"text":"I've been to HuHot 3 times, only once of my own accord.  Atmosphere: It's like going to church when you're an atheist. You're kinda scared that everyone thinks this is actually a good idea.  Food: The meat tastes off. All of it. The chicken the pork the sausage. It all tastes off. I hope you like vegetables and noodles. The sauces are fine. They do a good job of covering up the awful taste of everything else.  Service: Never had a problem. Nice waiters and the grill cooks are nice to watch.   Review: Its 14 dollars a person. Spend a few more and get some good hibachi at Fuji or Takara. Or if you don't care about taste just spend way less and get Culver's. Why are you reading any other reviews? Seriously. Here's my review: Don't go here."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have recipes that you can make your own dishes or use their cards it and make a dish from their selections and the cooks are exceptionally nice the waiters were very well attended I did not think the price was overrated for the amount of food that you could go back up and get. This will definitely become one of my main staples!"}
{"text":"Good service (Rob). You choice what do you want eat. They have a salad and beefs bar for choice and in minutes the good \"cocineros\" lo hacen para usted! Muchas salsas para escoger!"}
{"text":"Gross! This restaurant is a dirty spot. I have a hard time believing they don't violate health code, especially the cooks. The guys were both lax in their personal hygiene and pretty uncoordinated in their attempts to flip utensils Hibachi style, which they dropped on the ground (covered in partly charred, partly raw remnants, btw) and reused on our food (eugh). A dad in front of me in line said to me, \"Gosh, that's a recipe for disaster\" or some such. Also, there was no way to separate the meals on the grill, and pieces of one person's dinner invariably wound up in someone else's. Definitely not a place for someone with food allergies. The grill itself  was not cleaned between each round of grilling, and my husband notes that the bowls at the food selection areas hadn't necessarily been washed before they'd been put back by service staff! Extra unpleasant, guys.  Funny note: when we received our check, we noticed a review card in the fold filled out by somebody else (rather than the standard blank one). As it turns out, it was a close friend of ours - who stated exactly the same opinions we had about cleanliness.  I hesitated to even eat my dish, given my fears of food poisoning and advancing pregnancy. Nothing bad happened, thank goodness, but it was disgusting enough that I wouldn't go back. There are equally inexpensive places to eat that won't appall you quite so much."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay. We went for lunch and even though the restaurant was half empty, we had to wait 15 minutes. When we asked the host why, he said they were short staffed. The few staff working were racing around to cover their tables."}
{"text":"I was a fan of Flat Top so I was interested to try HuHot. We'd been saving it to hit up for lunch on a random day when my gent and I were both free, and a snowy morning that turned into a sunny afternoon was just the ticket.   We came in around 1:30 PM on a Friday and it was pretty dead. We were seated quickly and given the rundown on how it works - $9.99 for an all you can eat, build your own experience. We headed over to the line, grabbed bowls, and started filling. There's a table of meats and seafood plus two types of noodles, two tables of veggies, and a final table with sauces. You take your bowl to a circular area with a grill in the middle, and move down the line as they cook yours in order. The staff was using the same spatulas on each dish, so if you have any sort of allergy or preference for staying strictly veg I'd talk to the grill master when you hand over your bowl. After you get your cooked food there's an array of toppings and seasonings on your way out of the line.  For the most part everything was cooked well; the only thing I didn't care for was the Brussels sprouts that just needed a couple minutes more than everything else in my combo and were a little tough. I did like that the meat was basically shaved to deli slice thickness; I like my meat cooked through and this gave me the confidence to try the beef on my second round. I actually ended up preferring the beef to the chicken, which is not usually how it goes for me.   Our server was great, but overstretched - she had multiple tables, plus was answering phones, running drinks, and changing a keg. I made my dish a little too spicy and couldn't get her attention to get a water refill until I was almost through my plate and had resorted to sucking on ice cubes.   The servers at HuHot recommend 5-6 ladles of sauce; if you like your dish saucy make sure your ladles are full or that you add a little more; most of the sauce cooks off on the grill. We were also told the sauces get spicier as you go down the line; I heard and understood it, but missed the fire symbols due to glare on the sign and added a little too much of the Khan's Revenge BBQ sauce. After dumping it all over my food I saw the six fire symbols and cut it with extra garlic broth, but it had my nose running. It was delicious, though, and next time I'll just put one ladle instead of two.   If you don't know what to do for sauce, there are popular combos on the sign above the sauce table, and there are also a bunch of recipe cards at the start of the line.   For weekday lunch I was pleased with the price; for dinner I don't think I could eat enough to justify the price since you can't bring home any leftovers."}
{"text":"Well this place is not my cup of tea. Although if I had, my kids with me or I was in college looking for a decent place to eat and get my monies worth this is the spot. The food is you pick they cook it. The cooks did a good job,a little less clanging of the spatulas would be appreciated  though. All in all was a decent place for a meal as a we had to choose last minute. For me not high on the list though."}
{"text":"No idea why those here are trashing this place so bad. It's just like any other Mongolian BBQ chain I have been to. Maybe better. Yeah the meat is frozen. So what? The other places had it frozen also before thawing it in the buckets. The sauces were good in my opinion, not bland. And there were many of them to choose from. Especially the black Thai peanut sauce which was great on chicken. The vegetable selection was large and nothing ran low while I was there. Service was good and the food was cooked as quickly as possible. I tried small plates of several different combos and thought everything was good. How can $13 seem too expensive when you get to build and watch your own food cooked in front of you? This is not monumental food but is sure hits the spot when you are craving some stir fry noodles that can be as spicy as you like. I would go here again."}
{"text":"the place has a wide variety of sauces to select from..... the food is fresh and good in taste.....i like their egg drop soup as well.... it is a nice place to have lunch, less crowd at that time...."}
{"text":"Line was so big for self serve grill that technically can't get more than one serving...not enough waiters to support colume"}
{"text":"For a quick stop, this place filled my tum and that's about all I needed at the time. I was happy with this visit, but won't make it a destination spot.  The variety of items available for the grill wasn't the wide selection that I'm used to from other favorites."}
{"text":"1st time there today . The food & service was delightful.  The guys cooking were very pleasant, & did a great job . It was very tasty . one of them even sang a bit.  Our waitress TYRA was spot on. Her explanation of what to do was great.  She explained how to download & use their APP., what days they have shrimp  too. Plus, after refilling our tea she noticed we could also use more ice, & brought us each a glass of ice  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I love it, my friends love it, my husband loves it, and even our super picky kids enjoy the food. The service is amazing. Even when they are super busy, the waitress is attentive and all the staff members are friendly. The thing is, it isn't a regular restaurant. Yes, there are a few items on the menu, but really it is a buffet. You go in and make unlimited bowls of food for a flat price. There are a ton of options to choose from, and they cook the food right in front of you. Plus, kids two and under eat free from the buffet. We did get the crab rangoons appetizer, and they were wonderful. We have been here three times already, and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Was hoping to add a restaurant to the \"close to home, works for the whole family for dinner\" category, but HuHot won't be in the rotation.  Positives: Service was perfectly friendly, and the kids liked watching the guys at the grill. My 12 year old still fits the kid category for a $4.99 stir-fry.  These are the things that saved it from 1 star overall.  The rest: The food is pretty bad-- one star for sure.  First I put something together based on pork and one of their spiciest sauce combinations.  Whether it was the meat or the prep, the pork was like leather (my wife compared hers to beef jerky) and the sauce could best be described as \"gooey\" (my wife's teriyaki was best described as \"salty\").  I then tried a bit of chicken with a Pad Thai sauce-- the chicken had the same unidentifiable (as chicken) texture, and the sauce was similar in its gooiness to the first sauce.  Here's the clencher-- my 7 year old declared the chicken strips the worst he's ever had.  And this kid has looooow standards when it comes to chicken strips.  As compared to Flat Top Grill at Hilldale (which to me always tastes good, fresh, and healthy), HuHot fails miserably. Too bad Hilldale is too far to drive when two kids are hungry, and they don't have the requisite nuggets, cheese pizza, or corn dogs for the 7 year old..."}
{"text":"Never again...I guess they don't have much in the way of Mongolian bbq in Madison but this was a poor excuse for it at best...the meat didn't look fresh...the bar area was not well maintained...food was everywhere...the sauce area was a disaster...the offer you rice and soup to go with your dinner and the rice isn't cooked properly...and the soup was a sad excuse for hot and sour...YUCK!!! Once and only once...never again HuHot"}
{"text":"Probably won't go here again. Two of us for dinner. One beer, one water. No apps or dessert and dinner was $40+.  We waited for a few minutes for a hosted who sat us, and our server was very nice. Although we waited over ten minutes for our bill and to pay it. It seemed like there were a lot of college kids there taking advantage of the all you can eat. You go, compiled your dish and wait in line to get it. At Flat Top on Campus, you can go sit and they bring your bowl to you. They had chicken which wasn't good at all. Mussels which were mostly open, which means they were dead and shouldn't be eaten. The beef was okay. Veggies were really nice and fresh. Good sauces. Cooked well. Over all there are a lot of other places in town I would have rather had dinner for over $40. And would have been much better."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Strait out Mongolian grill food. Always stocked. Has a decent selection of meats and veggies. Flavors are always good.  I just csnt get over how lunch and dinner are a $5 difference just because it's a different time. $10 for lunch and $15 for dinner.  Well keep going for lunch when we need a quick bite."}
{"text":"HuHot is a basic asian inspired restaurant. If you have a taste for a variety of Asian noodles while keeping it healthy, they are a good pick.  HuHot is a semi buffet. As someone who hates buffets, I actually don't mind this because you pick the food you want from a cold/frozen bar of noodles, poultry, beef, tofu, seafood, veggies and at least 20 different sauces.  Once you're done with your selection, you take it to the flat top grill to be cooked. The food is being cooked to order so if you have any issues with germs and buffets, it does ease the mind a bit.   I do like the variety they offer of food selections. Personally, despite what the comment said below in regards to vegetarians options, I think HuHot is pretty vegetarian friendly. I was quite surprised to read the comment. Ive gone to HuHot once in the pass year and even then I felt they had a lot of selections for non meat eaters. If you're not a noodle person, you can have white or brown rice served to you.   Its a cool place to take the kids so they can see their food being made Mongolian Grill still and is all you can eat. You can order off a menu if you prefer but I think they are known for their Mongolian Grill.  They are overall a very decent place. I like going to HuHot when I'm in the area and would recommend them for the cost and style."}
{"text":"my family been here several times never had anything but excellent service very good variety of meats and veggies wide variety of sauces to please different tastes from mild for me to very hot for hubby like that they a kids menu if the little one aren't in the mood for the buffet though when they they can things they enjoy love the totilla never would have to eat mongolian buritos"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have normally chosen to go to dinner here, but a flip of a coin sealed the deal..also, I'm staying at a hotel within walking distance, and the options here are extremely weak. (I wish this trip had me staying in downtown Madison, that place is amazing)  The restaurant seemed clean enough, but when the host sat us, the first 2 tables he deemed unacceptable..for whatever reasons, so we had to go on to table #3, in the corner.  The entire system of ordering and putting together your main course is what really irked me. Grab a bowl, fill it with ingredients and hand it over to the chefs - sounds simple, which it is except...  A table full of half frozen meats to put into your small bowl was gross, and was the beginning of my losing my appetite. Then, you choose one of maybe 3 types of noodles, but they all seemed the same....then if you have enough space in your bowl, put a few veggies to round out the dish. Then theres another table with an overwhelming assortment of sauces, but only half of them had utensils in their dishes.  Then I hand the dish off to the chefs, who are busy doing tricks with their spatulas behind the counter for tips. I just wanted my food, not a spectacle.  The food turned out alright, really nothing i'm looking to have again...I might have enjoyed it a little better if the staff didnt ask if things were okay every 5 minutes. It's nice that they were attentive, but this was over the top."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came for lunch on 5/17 and didn't have high expectations because they were new.  Our waitress was named Mack, I believe and she was super friendly and great the whole time.  Stir fry dishes turned out delish and i guess we must had picked the right sauce mixture because they were great on both trips up.  Our only complaint was they were out of all kinds of soda flavors since they have the remix machine, so she didn't charge us for my fiances drink since it took about 4 tips to find something that was in stock.  The hot and sour soup was oddly flavored and super salty.  The egg drop soup was so insanely salty it was not edible.  We didn't complain but she asked why it was uneaten so we told her and she didn't charge us for that either.  She did recommend downloading their app to receive a free appetizer that trip, so that was nice.  We tried the pot stickers they were ok, a little cold but the sauce they come with wasn't very good, it almost tasted like BBQ sauce so we opted to use the asian sweet sauce on the table in a bottle.  We will most likely try again in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the service is great! The cooks are awesome and it's pretty fun as you get to build your own bowl! You can go back for more food as many times as you want if you eat there it's pretty sweet. If you're super hungry head over and check them out, so good!"}
{"text":"I have to say I've eaten at this location 10+ times along with at least 15 others across the midwest over the past 14years. The food at this one was well stocked, the line for the grill was short and service at the table quick. Food was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"We agree with the last review...there's no reason to trash this place, everything was great. Food was good, place was clean, decor is cool, people were super friendly (especially considering we were there an hour after close), the cook was awesome & performing tricks. The only thing is dinners are $12.49 which is ok on occasion, but the $1 beers totally made up for it!"}
{"text":"I knew this going in, but I went anyways ... 10 bucks for lunch 13 for dinner ... it is pretty much just Syco frozen foods that are heated with a sauce .... BUT it is all you can eat!  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Came to HuHot for lunch. Nice atmosphere , fresh cooked food, and had a nice waitress named Endia. Never had Mongolian food, but after that meal ,I'll be back for dinner  with my family..."}
{"text":"Great variety of meats, veggies and sauces.  Love the all you can eat aspect and hundreds of flavors you can add to your soda.  Favorite place to eat on the west side of Madison."}
{"text":"The HuHot has become my go to Mongolian spot - across the country they are consistently good with fresh veggies and lots of meat choices My niece is allergic to shellfish - they made her plate from a separate area in back then cooked it on a cleaned and segregated area of the stove I was impressed with how they handled her allergy while allowing us all to eat at the same place Also the sauces - black Thai peanut is my fave!"}
{"text":"Good food but every time I leave I am sick because I ate too much. Like making my own food! I also get the brown rice to eat with my food. Wish they had eggs like Mongolian grill. Sauces are good. Some are in love with this place but I honestly don't care if I go back or not. Nothing crazy but good service. You get what you come for."}
{"text":"It was our second time here.   Not nearly as impressed as the first but then again we didn't come back for a year so maybe we weren't impressed that much anyway.  It's a neat idea, food isn't bad, but it's nothing to rave about either.    The cooks use to be fun and show off their chopping skills, there was none of that anymore.    Service was pretty good, but we thought it was tacky for all the waiters to hang around the bar area and chat, with a little swearing added to the mix.  Have went 2 years in a row for birthday of my daughter, apparently birthdays aren't as important to them any more since last year.  Not that anything was really expected, but when you set a precedent...  Overall, on the ride home my wife and I decided it's not worth going back.  In my opinion, based on the crowd, we might not be the only ones.  Was worth a try once, a year ago, not anymore.  Time to move on..."}
{"text":"The food was good. There was poor service, all of the employees sat at the bar and we waited for ages to get out bill. Our waiter seemed to be the only employee actually working."}
{"text":"Disappointed that the service here has gone downhill over the last couple of years. The food is fine and hasn't changed so \"yay\"?    On two occasions in the last 8 months I've had to wait at the front door for 5-10 minutes waiting to be acknowledged by staff who zip by me, then I've had rushed service from servers want to \"keep things moving\" and have watched the grill attendant eat his meal a few tables away from me at the end of his shift.   If you're on a budget or have picky eaters in your group, then HuHot makes sense. If you'd like a decent dining experience, move along."}
{"text":"Super pleased with the care and attention they gave my food allergy. Service was great and food was filling and decently priced. Far superior to flat top in my opinion"}
{"text":"I love Hu Hot!  TONS of options to pick from.  I enjoy the ability to be creative and build my own meal.  Want more water chestnuts?  Pile 'em on!  Wohoo!  Don't care for mushrooms?  Don't take any!  Every trip to Hu Hot is a new experience - customizing your meal to whatever you have a hankerin' for that day.    The meat selections are nice - I usually flip between beef and chicken.  I'm not fond of seafood, so \"shark\" never makes it in my bowl.  The frozen \"meat chips\" could be a turnoff, but it cooks up nicely and doesn't seem to be an issue.  For other ingredients, I can't think of anything that is missing.  The sauces are abundant!  I appreciate the posted combinations, if nothing else to give me direction in my creativity.  Want it hot?  You can do that.  Want it mild?  Plenty of options there, too.  And everything in between!  The chefs do a great job preparing the food, often putting on a little show.  Tip those guys!  They work hard and that grill is plenty hot.  They deserve a little extra something...  The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star review is their \"bread\".  Call me crazy, but I'd swear they just microwave some stale store-bought flour tortillas.  But other than that, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The guy with the gauges on the grill did an amazing job handling the grill by himself. Don't forget to bring in singles to tip the grill! My server was very kind as well."}
{"text":"Common Mongolian grill. Buffet, eat until you cannot eat. I will recommend this to you if you are very very very hungry and really need some meat."}
{"text":"Ok well yes first day open went with a friend and dinner being$16.00 and another $3.00 for beverages. $22.00 with tip. Get bank statement $28.00 out of my account.  Food.... Not at all what I expected meat was like shoe leather and the bowl was full but when and after cooked dinky lil serving. Sauces where good but $20.00 worth of sauce. Service... Terrible..said they had sweet tea brings me tea and sugar packets. And the tea tasted awful?soapy?funky? Like made in old or unclean container. Switched to a soda beverage and took forever for refills.  I received a gift certificate to go back... Not anytime soon.. Was talking with someone about the place asked how they like it and at the same time we both said \"shoe leather\"...  SHU HOT.... TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"One of the better Mongolian bars I have been to.  Large buffet of choice (meat, sea food, veggies, and sauces).     Cooking staff is enthusiast and entertaining.  While coking, they are flipping utensils, throwing water bottles, and tossing tools back and forth to each other.       Food was good---it is what you make of it since you are making the choices. :-).   One of the highlights is that they offer recipes to aid in your choices along with what will taste great together.  They also offer additional sauce recipes too.   Salad, rice, and tortillas are included with your dinner (if your getting the buffet).    Guaranteed to be a great time."}
{"text":"Not the best, but definitely something you'll miss once a while. Came here once for a seafood night and was quite good. I'm always full after two or three full plates. For my friends, most of them like to have rice with the grill."}
{"text":"Meat was completely rock solid frozen. I don't think that's normal compared to other mongolian grills (let's call it MG) I have been to but maybe its better sanitation wise? I thought my meat turned out good, my bf's meat was still cold in some parts and he complained the meat was tough.  (I will say that I was very hungry and inhaled the food in half the time that my bf did even though he's 3x's my size--which never happens)   Meat selection wasn't that extensive compared to other MG's i've been to.   We went on labor day and they were open (yay!) and there wasn't a line to get to the grill."}
{"text":"Interesting set up and restaurant! I love watching the cooks do tricks with their spatulas. And the cooks are always so nice and polite. I am not a fan of Asian cuisine but I always love to give it a try. This place offers so many options to create your own flavors that it always tasted great!  I've been here a couple times and it seems that most of the servers are rather slow. Last time we went, we were already through our second plates before she finally brought the rice. But still even when she was there (and the other servers) they were always very polite and helpful!"}
{"text":"I honestly love HuHot, and go there at least 1 to 2 times a month.  The staff is always friendly, but not always prompt, especially with refills.  The first time I was there, no one told us ingredients in the sauces, and no one asked if we had any food allergies.  I ended up eating an entire plateful of food in a sauce that I was allergic to, and it got pretty bad.  Since then, I noticed they not only ask each time, but then the grillers clean a spot on the grill extra clean and keep your food separate if you do have an allergy, and even use different spatulas and what not.  They even have a book they offer you if you have a food allergy to show you all ingredients in everything they have.  It was because of this care of the customers that has kept me coming back.  I've always felt welcome here, and even a few of the waiters take time to recognize us and come over and say hi.  As for the food, it is pretty much delicious.  Being a vegetarian, it is nice to put together my own meal and just skip the meat section.  There are a ton of things a vegetarian can eat, and I'm always stuffed well past dinner time after eating only 2 platefuls here.  The food is pretty much always fresh and well stocked.  However, definitely take your time with the sauces.  I have tried a bunch of different combinations, and I honestly think you really have to try hard to screw up the sauces part (I have put some weird ones together and it has never tasted bad!), but be mindful of the type of sauce you are putting in to know how much you need.  They have good combination ideas on little cards for you to follow, but if you like the sauce to give you the most taste instead of just complimenting your ingredients, then add a few extra spoonfuls of your favorites.  I find when I follow the rule of thumb there, it tastes good, but slightly bland, and always add maybe one or two extra spoonfuls of something to make it more \"saucy.\"  If you go overboard and get too much in there, it can get messy, but you only have to deal with it from the sauce stand to the grill, and they have napkins and hand sanitizer there.  The only reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is just due to slow service most of the visits.  Other than that, definitely a place to check out!  Don't forget to throw in a tip for the grillers at the end!"}
{"text":"I wrote a previous review about HuHot but deleted it thinking it was unfair without going twice. Well, I went back a second time and found the same problems as before. Service for drinks was prompt. Waitresses were wonderful to us. But, there is so much salt in the food. My family that went with me the first time and my boyfriend that went with me the second time agree that there is some sort of flavor enchancer in the food. Even if it might not be MSG, I find myself sucking down six glasses of water during two plates of food. They advertise no MSG, but my taste buds would like to differ.   Also, my family and I got stomach aches after coming here the first time. When I came here a second time, the same thing happened. My boyfriend and I both had to take immodium.  I love cooked peapods and broccoli and things like that, but I don't think those 5-6 ladles are necessary. Wayyyy too much salt for my taste and expensive for what it really is."}
{"text":"After eating here the first Wednesday this year, Kridz and I decided we would be eating at a different restaurant that WE haven't been to, or haven't been to in a while.  Kridz wanted something like 301, and we don't go to campus, so this was our best/only option.  We were seated quickly, and informed of how it worked, so that was nice. Asked what we wanted to drink, and what kind of soup we wanted. Then we wet up and created our dishes.  I wasn't expecting to see completely frozen proteins. That was weird. I guess it helps with keeping foods fresher when they are sitting out all day, but it looked like frozen beef jerky. there were a variety of proteins, and we were informed that they have something special on other days...  Well, our dishes finished cooking, so we sat down to eat.  Then our drinks arrived.  We finished eating, then our soups arrived.  The server was very friendly and courteous.  My noodles didn't seem ... noodle-y. It seemed extremely overcooked. I put this down to the frozen meats taking longer to cook, and the noodles being started at the same time.  So, for starting the year at a place we've never been to, we learned that this is not the place for us."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Mediocre stir-fry and a $50 tab.  What's the point?"}
{"text":"The food was cooked perfect and sauces were excellent. Loved the selection of noodles and veggies. All the cooks were super nice and talkative. My only complaint is the lack of bread and eggs like other Mongolian grills. Would also like to see shrimp as a option for a up charge. Lunch is reasonable for the unlimited food. Sign up ahead of time for rewards and ger a free app."}
{"text":"Seriously?  $13+ to scoop up some frozen food and then have a chef \"stir fry\" it for 5 minutes?  I really just don't understand the appeal of HutHot.  The restaurant itself is the typical chain of suburban-style places that put some kind of authentic looking name on a place that is more ordinary then what I get at the grocery store.  First off, the food that is provided in the buffet might be all you can eat, but I'd never want to make more than one trip.  It's all frozen, the beef is thinly sliced and of a poor cut, the vegetables / side items are all stringy and pathetic looking, and there's little description to go with the labels.  I tried a few of the user recommended combinations, only to be confronted with a dish that had an awkward taste to it and left me with a half-full plate of something I had no interest in finishing.  I hate being harsh on a restaurant, but this is not something I'd recommend to anyone.  If you want all you can eat, you could go to an OCB and probably get better food (and I'd feel bad for you then too), and if you wanted Asian cuisine, there's plenty that are much better (or your own cooking).  I understand the concept of these places.  Sure, you make your own food but they're supposed to provide ingredients and cuts that are better than what you could find at the grocery store.  Too bad this doesn't ring true with HuHot.  At least the service was ok and the items were well stocked.  Other than that, absolutely nothing that would compel me to spend $13 there again."}
{"text":"First of all, it's not gourmet, high end, or romantic. I wouldn't come here on Valentine's. But it is a good deal of you are hungry and know you can make three or more trips up through the buffet line, and I think it's fun and tasty.   For novices to Mongolian BBQ places, after being seated and ordering drinks and appetizers, choosing a soup or the house salad (free with meal) and designating if you would like white or brown rice, or tortillas with your meal, you head up to the raw buffet. You pile a bowl with whatever meats (choose from beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, 2 kinds of sausage, fish) and veggies (there are about 20 varieties, so I won't list them) or noodles (3 varieties) you want. Then you add pre-made sauces, or concoct your own, using soy, garlic oil, lime juice, sesame oil, etc. You then head to the large round grill, hand your bowl to a cook, and they grill it while you wait. Whole process takes between 5-10 minutes, depending on the crowd. Repeat as desired.  Yes, the meats are frozen, as are some veggies. But so are most of the foods you get at other places, before they arrive at your table fully cooked. You just aren't aware that the ingredients were frozen before they got to your plate. Putting out the frozen product decreases the risk of food poisoning, as the less time a food is at room temperature, the better.  Yes, the cooks are cooking your food \"right next\" to another patron's food. But so what? What do people thinks happen in the kitchen of any other restaurant? If you were under the impression that a restaurant kitchen only cooks one meal at a time on the grill, or sanitizes the grill between orders, you were sadly mistaken.   Someone noticed that the cooks dropped a utensil and reused it. I have been here no less than 6 times, have seen dropped utensils a few times, and always saw them placed in a separate bin and never reused. But are you sure that the cooks hidden in a kitchen at your favorite restaurant never reuse a dropped utensil? Really?  Anyway, getting to the food - I have 2 picky kids. Both like meat, and hate veggies. This is their idea of paradise. They can make exactly what they want, and as a bonus, kids 11 and under eat for $4.79. This was an awesome deal for my son at age 11.  Once when we were there, a group of 6 UW guys were eating, and went up at least 5 times. Again, for them it must have been a bargain.  As for the sauces, you can make them as tasty as you want with all of the ingredients available. At first mine were hit or miss, until I figured out some good combinations. They also have recipe cards that list ways to make some tasty combos.  One caution: I would not go here if I had severe food allergies. I saw the routine the cooks go through to clean the grill for someone with allergies. It's the same routine that cooks in other restaurants use for people with allergies, but for someone like my niece with life-threatening allergies, I would never bring her here given the possibility of contamination. But she also rarely eats at any restaurant, for the exact same concerns.  Overall, it's a good deal if you are hungry, kids love it, it's great for picky eaters. But it's not for people who prefer to have their food prepared out of their sight."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. Lovely place and delicious food with a lot of meat and vegetable options. For meat you could choose beef, chicken, pork, fish, mussels, meat balls and so on. For vegetables you could choose green beans, mushrooms, sweet corns, Kales, tofu, lettuce, carrots and so on. Much much options of the sauces. If you never been here before, you deserve to try.  The weekly lunch (unlimited grilled dishes mixed meats and vegetables as well as free white rice and brown rice option) is kind of cheap. $21.08 for two people before tips.  The server Hilleree is really nice and kindful. The recipe with cute hello kitty tag on it, which makes me warm!"}
{"text":"My teenager had a doctor appointment mid-week and to spend some quality time I let him pick lunch instead of another middle school hot lunch.  Their lunch special is 9.99.  For that you get your choice of rice and then get to mix your own specialty mix of the grill choices.  If you are new there are recipe cards you can follow, or do like I do and wing it.  Grab a bowl and you get to choose between multiple meats, noodles and vegetables to create the dish you want.  You can do all meat with a few random peppers like my son's round one, or a mixture like most are.  Then you choose your sauce.  Each sauce is labeled and also categorized by temperature.  I'm not a spice fan, so I stay to the left.  Round two of the boy's was a bit too far to the right so I got to laugh while he chugged his peach Diet Mellow Yellow.  Then you give your bowl to the grill person who heats it and if you're lucky does a fun little show with his or her grilling utensils.  If you don't want to hit the \"make it yourself bar\" there is a menu of other items to pick.  Biggest pluses:  multiple trips.  While I was comfortable with one, my teenage boy hit three and a half.    Service:  our waitress was phenomenal.  She had our refills before we needed them (a good thing when the spice kicked in!) and I cannot express how awesome she was.    Price: again-it was 21.00 for me to be full and a teenage boy to be full.  Kudos.  Cleanliness: granted it was fairly quiet as it was the beginning of their day, but it was spotless.  I'd happily let my son stuff himself again there."}
