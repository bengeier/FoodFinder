{"text":"Never fails to disappoint! Best sushi in Richmond Hill / Vaughan area.  Generous helpings of amazingly delicious fish. Maki rolls are simply so fantastic that it seems impossible to ever have better"}
{"text":"Really bad service, very unfriendly and indifferent staff. We got four people visited this restaurant this Saturday.  There were roughly 5 tables available (totally around 10)with only one marked reserved . However, we were told that all the tables were reserved and I was just left there. I requested to make a reservation as well but the waitress just said nothing and went back to work. No one took care us at all and we were just left at the door. Will never come again nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I got take out sushi from this place , The taste was perfect and very fresh .The place was cozy and modern . TheService was very fast . I'll order again soon"}
{"text":"Very fresh sashimi in large portion! Great place if you are craving for sashimi and many kinds of hand rolls, better quality than those all you can eat places. Will come back!"}
{"text":"First of all NOT SAKE BAR !!!  Sashimi combo that I ordered, more than 50% was Cheap Salmon.  Should try \"Gonoe\" then you could review thia restaurant.   I eat sushi or Sashim atleast once a week.   Very disappointed.. I do not consider Roll as a Sushi..   Big Rolls (lots of rice and cheap Salomon) are their specialty !!  I don't go back.   North York area has Better qualify Sushi and Sashimi."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places that I have been to!  Ordered the salmon sashimi and 2 premium maki rolls (Roy's Dream Maki and Orangeville Roll). Everything tasted fresh and the flavours of the maki rolls were amazing.  Only complaint would be that the rolls are too big, so it falls apart when you're trying to eat it.  Excellent decor and good customer service as well. Will definitely make a trip back here!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant that has a classy downtown feeling.The sushi quality is a top notch. The decor is super and the sake selection is exciting. Stands above the many usual sushi places. Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Everything was served at the same time so my dumplings got cold while I was eating my soup. The portions are way larger than your average Japanese restaurant so we over ordered without realizing. Prices are high and quality is not. We also had to flag a waitress down for our water to be refilled. The bill was taking forever to come so again we flagged down a waiter. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Got takeout a few times from this sushi place. Solid food, decent prices, and friendly service. Their fish is fresh and rolls are of decent size. Service is always pretty fast as well."}
{"text":"Below average quality service and food. Mostly tasteless. I went here based on the OK reviews but that was a mistake."}
{"text":"Family owned, very friendly. The quality is top notch,the size or the rolls are very generous as well as the price but it is soooo worth it"}
{"text":"Okay so the sashimi donburi is my favourite dish here (it's basically sashimi salad with a great spicy dressing. Also I ask for? salmon sashimi only) it's also a pretty good value. The service usually sucks and the parking lot is always full. But otherwise the salad is good and their rolls are huge!"}
{"text":"Food was good. The staff were nice and attentive. I loved their Agedashi Tofu and Unagi dragon roll. Presentation of the food was nice but I felt that there was a lot of avocado in the Maki rolls. I asked for no cucumber but they didn't have to put a chuck of avocado to replace it. Overall I would come back."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing to complain about with the sushi. Greaaat sushi, well made, very fresh and good quality sushi. My fiance and i like the dragon roll, spider roll, maki, the bento boxes and the cali rolls. We go often during lunch hours. The bento boxes are fully packed.   Two things i didnt like was the beef teriyaki. Chewy and not really pleasant to eat. The spring rolls were flat and not really generously filled as i prefer them to be.   The atmosphere is quiet... Not too many customers unfortunately. Not sure how it is at night because ive never been there during later hours. There is a very nice, clean, modern look though and i appreciate that :)"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Not bad though.   I didn't find the sushi particularly fresh or interesting. As other have said the size of the rolls are large but that's all."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of this restaurant for 1 and a half years. For about the same price as the all-you-can-eat sushi in the area, the quality of the food in this establishment is what makes this place stands out.   Portion is big. Food is fresh every time. Nice decor. You will get filled!   One thing I don't like is that they don't take the shells off their shrimps and mussels in their seafood noodle soup. They have free WiFi, from Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"I pass by this restaurant and want to eat sashimi. So I stop there.  The front of the store is not appealing. Once you enter the restaurant surprisingly nice decorated, more like a high end western restaurant  I order some take out to go home.  The waitress stands far away to ask me and hands me the menu.  I decide to have both the sashimi and sushi.    While waiting at the sushi bar, I can see the dishes usually stay there for at least a few minutes before they are served.  There are only 3 occupied tables in the restaurant.  I wait for about 30 minutes before my take out is ready  The sushi and sashimi have salmon, tuna, white fish, shrimp and 2 other fish that are rarely seen in other Japanese restaurants. Overall the sashimi is thick, chewy but not cold enough"}
{"text":"Lived just down the street for 10 yrs. used to order take out a couple times a month. However, I had a really bad experience where I brought my food home only to find a hair in one of the dishes! Now i understand this can happen by accident. However when I called to report it I was amaZed at the lack of accountability for this violation of food safety protocol. They barely seemed to care and made no attempt to regain my trust. Lots of other neighbourhood options so I will never return."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 (I will bestow my reasoning behind this perfect score below)  Service: 3.5/5 (I've had one tumultuous experience trying to order on the phone)  Decor: 4/5 (Date-esque fo' sho)  Location: 4/5 (On Rutherford between Dufferin and Bathurst on the edge of the Thornhill Woods area, accessible for community residents and new visitors) (Parking in the plaza isn't bad either, but can get busy at peak times)  Price: Definitely a more expensive sushi place (but rightfully so), for a meal be expected to drop $15-20 per person easily.    This is sushi in Thornhill that doesn't force you to contemplate your financial choices and doesn't make you ask your friends if the salmon smells too fishy. This is real, FRESH sushi.   I've eaten in at this location twice and ordered take out probably 4 or 5 times so this is review is long overdue. My memory is a bit foggy on the times we ate in, but I know the presentation for the Love Boat and their other dishes stand out.   For food, my usual order is Maki Set H, which is 6pcs California Roll and 8pcs Dynamite Roll, priced at $18.50. Sometimes if we have people over, I'll add on some sushi from their a la carte menu, some yam rolls or cucumber rolls - all consistently good stuff. Ok, so for the Maki Set, I know the price is steep in comparison to many other \"sushi\" establishments in the area (I use the word \"sushi\" loosely after eating Aroowha's sushi), however, this price is reasonable.   Here's why it's worth it: Massive sushi rolls, sometimes a little too big (LEFTOVERS FOR DAAYYYSSS), with a proper rice to filling ratio. California rolls have crunchy strips of cucumber and ripe, creamy avocados, with a generous amount of tobiko and large chunks of crab meat. Dynamite rolls are beyond words.  All of the ingredients are fresh - everything in the sushi is so fresh that me, a picky eater who's always gagged at the idea of raw fish, eats and ENJOYS the fish in Aroowha's sushi. The salmon and tuna that I've eaten in the sushi are so buttery and soft in texture, it is so worth the price tag.   PS: They were also super accommodating when it came to subbing out shellfish in Love Boat orders for more salmon and tuna since my party doesn't eat shellfish.   All in all: go here!!"}
{"text":"Their sushi are very fresh and delicious!!!!! Price is on the higher end but the size of their roll is very large which makes it not expensive."}
{"text":"A nice quaint Japanese sushi place. Came here to try and was impressed with the quality and have been here several times. Quality of food and service is consistent with every visit.  Food:  Ordered a medium sushi and maki platter, aroowha roll, spicy double double roll and the kalbi appetizer. Was impressed with the quality of the fish and ingredients. Also, the rolls were all freshly made so it was especially good. Portion size is very generous. The sushi rolls are big (not because of the rice) because they put lots of ingredients in it. The kalbi was very tender and flavourful.  Service: Very good, servers here are very attentive. They come to check up on you and see what you think of the food."}
{"text":"After my intense day of Black Friday (weekend) shopping, I decided to refuel at Aroowha... and boy did it ever hit the spot. The salmon sushi is legit melt-in-your-mouth good, and the shrimp tempura is finger lickin' good. The shrimp they use for the tempura is actually pretty thick compared to some AYCE joints I've been to, and when served piping hot, it's SO freaking good. Service is the same as every other time I go, the servers are attentive and friendly. Will be ordering something from them for my office Christmas party"}
{"text":"On the expensive side, but worth every dollar. The rolls and the sashimi pieces were way bigger than average, and the quality was amazing. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice because I'm nearby but still disappointed. The quality is below Ayce sushi restaurant and overpriced too. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"When this place just opened, I liked it for its sashimi - nice size, tasted fresh.  It's rolls where around a 3 on a 10-point scale (rice doesn't resemble sushi rice, all of them are similar to glorified california rolls, no imagination).  However, the past couple of times that I visited this place have made me reconsider going there at all.  The service is just horrible.  Even though I've never seen this restaurant even half-full, the staff always looks like it's hanging around doing nothing, and you have to wait for your food.   What sealed the restaurant's fate for me was a visit with a friend where we were both able to get out around 9pm. I figured an hour should be enough to have a quick supper.  However, around 9:45 we were told to pay and leave because they were closing.  I have never seen such rudeness.  Even though they are supposed to stay open until 10pm and we were paying customers they told us to leave.  Guess where I'm not going to go to again.    If you're looking for a place to go, try Tomo Japanese Restaurant at Yonge and Weldrick instead."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Just went here for valentines dinner as it's close to home and we really enjoy the food. It is tucked away in a strip mall on Rutherford next to a Starbucks.   We got there around 7 pm and 2/3 of the booths we filled. We took the booth backing the door, bad idea. It was very windy and every time someone came in (which was often for pickups) the breeze would blow snow on me. It wasn't a big deal and I put my shawl over my shoulders. So this is just a warning but it was cold.   We sat and ordered a salmon sushi pizza... We always get this and its always delicious! The rice cake is not too thick and its piled on with lots of salmon, tempura bits and spicy mayo with green onions. Its best I've had anywhere!   We ordered the yaki soba noodles with chicken. Really good too. The noodles were nicely coated, lots of veggies and we asked for ours spicy and it had just enough heat to add flavor but not so spicy you can eat it. It was just right.  We tried the new premium rolls - Roy's dream roll which was dragon roll topped with avocado and teriyaki sauce. The spicy double roll with was a spicy salmon roll topped with salmon and spicy mayo. Our favorite was the spring time roll which was a California roll topped 4 types of fish and torched to give a smoked taste. Very good.   The only issue was that the rolls are too big and became a mess trying to eat it. This is why take away containers are handy as these oversized tastey sushi rolls are now a late movie snack.   The service was good as always. Our waitress was very friendly. The place was a full house by 8pm. I would suggest on busier nights, getting a reservations as those who arrived after 8, needed it. Its a little pricer I think but we always go overboard when we come here. I think for all stuff we ordered, it worked out to about $75."}
{"text":"This was my go to sushi joint when I used to live in the area and even now I'll try and grab some takeout whenever I get chance. I've always been a fan of their medium trio platter, it has always been a great value in both quality and quantity. Honestly if you live in the area there isn't a better option for sushi anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went to a friends house last night who was ordering some take out. I ordered a chicken teriyaki with no sauce or rice and extra vegetables to supplement. Open the container to find the chicken teriyaki absolutely swimming in sauce. To add insult to injury the vegetables consisted of some kind of onions and cabbage. The meal looked bland (no standard teriyaki veggies like broccoli, carrots, etc), gross and after draining the litre of sauce down the sink, didn't taste much better! Perhaps teriyaki is their Achilles heal. Lots of better places to spendmy money."}
{"text":"HUGE!  Food is above average with nothing really special to write home about. However... Be prepared to get stuffed! Like... Really stuffed.   I was at the table right beside the door so it was a bit cold, and it took quite a while to get us tea and menu so that knocked off a point. I will likely try again in the future, but seems good so far."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I've ever had. All the fish and vegetable are soooo fresh and the service was fantastic as well.  I went for lunch and got a maki set combo for $12.50 which was 12 huge rolls, soup and salad. Amazing!!  Would highly recommend driving out there even if you don't live nearby"}
{"text":"Great sushi with very generous portions. Everything super fresh and tasty. They also offer brows rice option."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for pickup.   Pros: - Nice ambiance   Cons: - Overpriced  - Sushi is average"}
{"text":"We've been to Aroowha twice. Really like their sashimi (always fresh) and the rolls (tasty and good size). Service is friendly and quick. The only thing I don't like are Japanese (or Korean?) videos playing in the background."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 23/5/11  Have been back a few times to see if things are still going strong. They seemed to even gotten better, with even more attention to detail on the tables as well. The food is just as good as the day it opened, and they have gotten us interested with every item on the menu. This place is a fantastic cure for places like \"Taste of Japan\" or other all-you-can-eat sushi places that serve mass-produced food. Only critique was that the Sake promo they had since they opened is now  gone, which allowed you to try different Sake for $1-4/glass. That was actually a lot of fun. I hope they consider bringing that back.  If I could give this place 6 stars out of 5, I would."}
{"text":"Very very good quality sashimi, fresh and good thickness! My husband who always go to Japan, said the tuna quality is almost comparable to what he gets in Japan! And the price is awesome too! I frequent Mi-ne Sushi before, but Aroowha is cheaper and same good quality!"}
{"text":"The quality of food here is spectacular! I eat sushi regularly, and I can tell you from experience that this place serves some of the highest quality sushi I have had in town. Can be a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it for me."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to, definitely the best in Vaughan. The quality is better than most sushi places, but the price is the same. The atmosphere and decor is very nice, but I also order take out a lot, and its usually ready in 5 - 10 minutes. I should mention that the maki pieces are huge, and everyone I bring also agree that the sushi would be more enjoyable if the pieces were smaller, because it's a little hard to eat. I have been here many times, and I have never been disappointed. One time I ordered the salmon teriyaki for pick up, only to find they gave me chicken teriyaki when I got home, and they actually delivered the right order to me very quickly. If you are ever on your way close to closing, sometimes they leave a little earlier than the closing time if there are no customers, so call ahead of time to let them know you are coming."}
{"text":"Pleasant decor amazingly delish rolls. Lobster roll and Orangeville rolls are massive, beautifully decorated and heavenly.  Appetizer sashimi is bountiful fresh and so tender.   Best new sushi in the area. A must try"}
{"text":"This is the nearest decent japanese restaurant in the area. We always get the sushi boat which comes with tempura. My only complaint is the rolls are too big. The dinner bento options are solid as well with the meat of your choice, rolls, salad, tempura and rice/veggies."}
{"text":"Rolls are yummy.  Service is great.  Interior is A-OK."}
{"text":"Visited recently during dinner hours. Ordered the \"Grande Sushi\" platter and was pleasantly surprised with the portions. Let me start of with some of the bad (and I'm being really nitpicky about this as well). One of the complaint that I had was that the Nigiri sushi had too little rice vs the fish size. In my opinion, sushi is all about the perfect balance between the fish and rice and, I felt that there was just too much fish going on. Also, the miso soup was not as flavorful as I had hoped, it tasted a bit bland and lacking.  Apart from those though, the fish that was used: salmon, red tuna (akami), etc. was very fresh! The rice too, although small in amount, was cooked just right, with a nice chewiness and flavor to it. The platter also came with spicy salmon maki which were HUGE in portions. The spicy mayonnaise used on them tastes pretty similar to other sushi places, and they gave the salmon a nice fatty and savory taste.  Overall, a very pleasant experience. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night 45 min before closing. Got 2 specialty rolls, the Aroowha and Orangeville roll. Both were pretty large in size and tasty. The inside of the Orangeville roll was a spicy scallop with lots of tempura bits, and actually had a bit of a kick to it."}
{"text":"Good quality and fresh ingredients.  Best you can ask for north of Toronto.  Small, quaint establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. Server mentioned extra sushi was included. Great service. Rolls are quit large. Surprisingly good fish quality. Fresh and tasty. Possibly best sushi in Thornhill"}
{"text":"Just a few words to start this review... You paid what you get, it is A LOT OF FOOD.    Now... On to the review. Came here for a friend's birthday dinner after deciding on where to go for dinner. The prior reviews got us enticed to come here. I made a reservation the day before and when I arrived, my table was early. The restaurant is quite clean and the service is spot on.   Onto the food. As stated earlier, it's a lot of food. Plus the pictures to go with it. Taste wise, it's okay. The fish is fresh. And taste isn't too overpowering. I ordered the venti sushi dinner set, and I was quite full from it.   Over all ambiance of Aroowha is casual. Staff are active to keep tabs on us to ensure we are all looked after. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I give this Japanese restaurant 4 star for service and 3 1/2 for food. This is a very generous place to eat sushi. Lot of fish and less rice on it. We couldn't even finish all our food. It was great when we were hungry because lot of fish in the sushi. But when we were full we felt it was too much of fish on each piece. Overall the food was little above average and the service is excellent! We will go back again."}
{"text":"Tried this a la carte sushi place out for the first time, we had the salmon bento box and some maki rolls (spicy tuna, spicy salmon). Food was quite good and service was great."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Place I have ever been to. My family and I order from here atleast once a week - whilst on the pricier side, the portions are huge and they are very generous with the ingredients.  The service is amazing as well - I place an order for takeout and even on busy days its ready within 15 min max.  The kitchen staff and servers are very kind and provide great service - which makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"Went with two toddlers, they like it there. Staff are friendly at this very busy restaurant. Food tastes great, one of the best we have in Thornhill area."}
{"text":"Food is cold when it came out,  food was ready 10 mins ago but the sushi roll is not ready yet,  and they prepared other people's rolls first while food is ready."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally found a replacement for a go to sushi joint.   The rolls are huge, the taste is excellent, the staff are super friendly, and the place is surprisingly cheap.   Will repeat, many times."}
{"text":"Been here lust week nice selection medium prices good neighborhood place sashimi fresh.service on the slow side.stuffs is friendly ."}
{"text":"An Awesome a la carte Sushi place. This place gets everything right with delicious and fresh sushi, quick service, and very professional and friendly staff.  This one waiter went completly above and beyond. My daughter spilled her Miso Soup. He cleaned it up and replaced it immediately without even being asked . I was very impressed.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious teriyaki salmon, as well as rolls. Fresh ingredients, tasty food, good service, clean and beautiful interior design... Overall a good sushi spot, will be definitely returning and bringing more friends next time!"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place in a sushi desert. I stopped in for a quick meal before a meeting. Not too busy this evening, and service was very attentive.   I ordered the Grande Sushi Dinner for $20. I could have had the Venti Sushi, but that felt too Italian. I subbed the California rolls for a spicy tuna maki.   The Miso was more flavourful than I remember from other places. The main course was beautifully done, fresh, generous cuts.  I found it refreshing that they would have a card on the table that outlined their standards of quality. Nearly everywhere else leaves you guessing, but here you have an understanding of the level of appreciation they have for their craft.   I left very full, and happy. I will return whenever I pass through the area!"}
{"text":"Food quality and speed deserves a 4* Service from the waitresses is 2* or less.  Restaurant would be exceptionally better if the staff weren't so patronizing.  But the food is great"}
{"text":"Sushi was really good and the size of each was EXTREMELY generous. The service was also very friendly. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too crowded + nice comfortable seats. Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"The sushi is always fresh, big portions, and delicious! It is on the pricier side but their lunch specials are a great deal."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the decor and the look of the restaurant. There's less seating than most sushi restaurant but that's what makes it cozy.   Everything on the menu I thought was quite pricey. However!!! If you order the rolls, they are actually massive! I COULDN'T EVEN FIT A PIECE ALL IN MY MOUTH!!! So don't judge! :)  It was quite delicious and very filling.   I ordered the caterpillar roll and roys dream maki in the roll section. Couldn't even finish it all and took some home. There's a lot of avocado in those rolls. Next time I want to try the spicy salmon roll!   I also ordered the sashimi dinner. The pieces of sashimi were huge and the fish were ok fresh. Not too bad.   Would I come back? I probably would, considering the nice service and huge pieces. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"My first time here, dined in with a friend.  Décor was nice, service could have been better.  My friend's food arrive way before mine did, I had to as where my meal was.  Refill on green tea wasn't offered, again I had to ask.  Part of my friend's meal didn't arrive until halfway through his meal (again, we had to ask about that as well).  On the up side, the food was excellent.  Salmon sashimi dinner was large, I couldn't even finish it.  By far, the freshest salmon I've ever had anywhere.  Miso soup is the best I've had, my friend also agreed.  I will probably go again at some point, maybe even just for take-out (that way I won't have to worry about the service!)."}
{"text":"Went last week. Great sushi large rolls and uber fresh. The service was impeccable. Going back tonight. Timing of dishes was spot on."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi joint! Prices are higher than other low to mid class sushi places (places with price points between $10-20). The reason why is the rolls and combos are ginormous! Normal sushi places have rolls that's the size of a small train, but here at aroowah, it's like a go train - twice the size!   The sashimi is really fresh and served beautifully. The service isn't bad. The waiters are always checking on you, but it would have been nice if we didn't have to ask for tea or water refills and they just did it! Food came pretty quickly!   Real ginger and powerful wasabi is another thing I use to tell if the place is legit. They definitely had that!  You can also do take out here. Credit cards accepted.  Free wifi as well."}
{"text":"Big amazing sushi. Fresh. 2 premiums roll. (roy's special roll, a must) 1 class roll  For 2 people, more than enough.  They gave us free classic sushies on the house to try. 50$ bill including a 8$ tip that we gave them.  Totally worth it. Got service. I recommand!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Merely edible food. The restaurant was dead and yet the server tossed us our food and never visited us again. We were so thirsty! People next to us got sashimi with scales still on it, and not in an intentional way. We waited to ask for the bill and eventually had to go up to the desk and pay lest we have to move in and pay rent.  AS FOR THE FOOD: We ordered spicy salmon/tuna rolls which where all tempura bits and barely any actual fish.  How can you mess up a spicy roll?? So easy! The spider roll was decent, non offensive but nothing special. Don't waste your time and $"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time as I was in the plaza at the dentist. Man oh man this place is a AMAZING  First off... the rice to fish ratio is amazing. 5% rice 95% fish. Wow. Unreal  The service was great. Pricing is a bit more than some other places I have been BUT IT IS WORTH IT.   Quality is not forgotten in this establishment. Wonton soup was the weakest item of the meal. It was good but not as outstanding as the rest of the meal.   Sashimi was so fresh. Rolls are massive. Fish cuts are very thick and super fresh.   Salad is great and not soggy like most other places. Fresh vinaigrette dressing is great and fresh.   FRESH and GENEROUS.  All three of us really enjoyed the meal. Even the rookie sushi goer we broke into the Cuisine today enjoyed it (haha you know who you are )   BTW come hungry. You will not be disappointed  MMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"Or go to sushi restaurant. Im usually a, bang for your buck quantity over quality person, while my other half is all about the quality.  This place has the best of both worlds. Their sushi love boat is huge and we always end up taking leftovers home. This set also comes with soup and salad.   Very fresh sushi, melt in your mouth and tasty."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  This restaurant is a hidden gem.  The Japanese food and sashimi is fresh and the portion is super generous.  The price is above average but consider the portion is generous, that makes up for it.  The place is small so the seats are limited.  A lot of people tends to buy take out because of the lack of seats available.  The waiter and waitress are friendly and offer suggestion when we don't know what to choose.  I love their spicy salmon double double roll.  It taste good!!! We were surprised that after our meal, the chef gave us another plate of spicy salmon double double roll and toll us it's on the house.  The food is good and service is awesome.  We will come here regularly from now on."}
{"text":"Yummy as always, going there for 3 years not-  honestly best sushi I've ever tried in my whole life. People put so much love and passion in this food - its just melting in your mouth. Worse every penny- not your typical sushi place.  Overall: - nice, clean, decorated from head to toe - washrooms are tidy - menu is very different for any taste and preferences, mentioning food standards  -always super fresh  -kids friendly- have chairs , crayons & markers - super nice people working there -will definitely recommend - had my birthday party last year- fast service  for 15 people at once! Will definitely come back- thank you for this amazing experience !"}
{"text":"I was at work one day and felt inspired to get sushi that wouldn't make me gag (ie: Longo's sushi or this other place in that Rutherford plaza) and my colleague actually informed me of this lovely place.  I was told to try the salmon dragon roll.    I've gone back since that recommendation and their salmon dragon roll is definitely my favourite.  It's really the only thing I've tried b/c usually that's sufficient enough for a good dinner or lunch but I shall venture off to more things.    Overall, I'm very impressed and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I like to grab takeout from this cute neighbourhood place. It is important to know that the quality here is very high, but everything is also huge (and not because of rice overload). If you order about 2/3 of what you would normally order at a sushi place for a meal, then that will be just right.  Today was much busier than usual with it being a PA day, so it wasn't as immaculate as usual. I also noticed some pre-sliced sashimi here for the first time. Nevertheless I still had friendly service and a nice hot tea to enjoy while waiting for my takeout.  I was very hungry so I ordered: New spicy scallop Maki Salmon Sashimi (3 piece - but it seems they threw in an extra piece no charge :) Agedashi Tofu  As expected, quality remains very high and everything was really delicious. I am stuffed."}
{"text":"Prices are maybe a tiny bit higher but the maki rolls are massive, it makes up for it! Every piece of sashimi was tasty, service was great and we were overall very impressed. We would go back 100%!"}
{"text":"Still the best sushi restaurant in Thornhill. Keep coming back for more and a ruler always seems to impress with not only its freshness portions and unique Sushi offerings. The head chef is amazing and very generous I was offering samples and bites of goodness."}
{"text":"It gets 4 stars because there wasn't much variety or customization as a vegetarian. The only types of sushi I was limited too were: 1) Cucumber 2) Avocado 3) Cucumber/Avocado. I tried other dishes there such as the tempura, which is very large compared to other tempura I've had tried at other sushi dives. The Soba and Udon were sub-par good.   The environment itself is very clean, very hygienic, including the bathrooms. They play Korean pop music in the venue if you're a fan of that, like I am :)   I have brought many of my friends to this restaurant to dine and they all loved it. Definitely recommended.  Parking: The parking lot is a small shared plaza parking lot, so spaces are limited.  Restaurant space: The restaurant is small but there are almost next to no waiting time to get a table here as it doesn't get very busy. You can walk in and grab a seat immediately."}
{"text":"This is a new place and I was thinking about the review as I was sitting and eating! First, I had the Kanisu salad, which is similar to a Kani salad It was DELICIOUS - it had almost no cucumber, which I like because many restaurants try to fill the salads with cucumber and not much crab It was FULL of crab and they mix it with tempura pieces, it seems It was VERY tasty and VERY different; it's served with a piece of avocado on the top with some peanuts sprinkled on... very good We also had the soba noodle with shrimp -- this comes out sizzling; it was good, the noodle has a bit of a sweeter taste and there is a strong onion taste as you get towards the bottom in terms of maki we got the orangeville roll which was huge and delicious very beautifully decorated and elaborate and very tasty -- this roll has scallop, crab, avocado, fish roe, salmon, you name it! We also had the spicy california role which I really enjoyed; the spicy sauce gives it more flavour and the shrimp tempura role Their tempura is different and very tasty It was all thoroughly enjoyed At the end of the meal we got a free bubbly fruit punch with fruit in it It was very nice and a nice end to the meal It is not cheap but prices are comparable to other higher end sushi restaurants  In terms of decor, very nicely decorated Heads up: they are closed on MONDAYS! (we went last Monday to try it out and were disappointed to leave empty handed :( ) They also offer smaller \"samples\" of Sake (1oz, which is a standard shot)  for around $1.50-$5, which is good to try out a variety of kinds!  They do offer terriyaki, Korean beef ribs and set maki dinners However, the dinners are somewhat expensive ($25 for Korean rib dinner which has rice, house salad and miso soup) BUT the lunch menu is cheaper... so if this is something you are more interested in, I would suggest going at lunch! I will definitely go during a lunch day and try out the Korean ribs! We enjoyed it and will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Very well prepared and very generous sized sushi and other meals. Have been coming to this restaurant since they opened. Although they are a little expensive,  they have ruined me for most other sushi restaurants  -their food just doesn't compare."}
{"text":"Very interesting experience here..the cons definitely outweigh the pros.  Their portion is massive, and by massive, I mean it's like nothing i've ever seen before. So if you are on a budget, and you're very very very hungry, Aroowha is probably the way to go. But the quality of the fish is meh.  Their menu seems to present a huge selection, but when it comes down to just sushi, you are either getting a plate of ALL salmon, ALL tuna, or half salmon half tuna. I was unable to finish 1/4 of my food.  And not sure how this is a sake bar..."}
{"text":"Lunch time delight. Service was fast, staff very friendly. Not a sushi fan so I ordered the Beef Teryaki Box. Food was delicious. Small negative the beef would have been better if more tender. Hard to cut with Chop sticks. Will go back. Lots of parking. Can you believe it right next to Starbucks........how could I not resist that cup of java. :)"}
{"text":"This place has great reviews, and now I know why!! I took out dinner from here and tried some different rolls and the tofu dinner set. I was blown away by the portion of the tofu dinner it was enough for two meals!!! The tools were quite large as well; I personally don't like how they add lettuce into the rolls but now I know to ask for no lettuce. I've heard it was pricey-- I honestly didn't find it too bad but compared to other places it is on the pricier side. I'll def return and try some other items !"}
{"text":"The service is so nice here. They are helpful and kind. The sushi is great quality from the rice and fish too! Their servings was quite filling and will satisfy your sushi craving ;)"}
{"text":"4.5-Take out order (would give 5 stars but need to dine in to judge)   This is my first review on any food related site. I felt compelled to write a review because the sushi I had tonight was really good. Maybe I am in a state of shock because every restaurant in the area is really just mediocre. I ordered a considerable amount of maki and was pleased with each roll. The standout gem had to be the spicy scallop roll which was loaded with flavour. I also really liked how one of the waiters assisted me with the order by walking it out to my car (I was able to carry the tray plus the bags but he insisted). Overall, fantastic sushi, great experience ,  looking forward to dining in."}
{"text":"Aroowha falls somewhere between a 3.5 and a 4 star rating for me. I was very happy with the portions and quality of the sushi I picked up. It looked great, even for take-out, it was very fresh and they were more than generous with the portions. Definitely shows a good value, even at the premium price point. Somewhere that's a little less of a dent on the wallet than some of the other local sushi places, but doesn't skimp on quality."}
{"text":"Pros: good and fast service, huge and tasty rolls, loved the Kani salad as well.  Con: pretty pricey, cost us almost $60 for 2 huge rolls, kani salad and 2 miso soups..."}
{"text":"This review is based on a few takeout visits of their maki rolls. The prices are a tad on the high side compared to others ($15+tax for a dragon roll) but the quality and size were on par. Fresh and hefty rolls."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place but you definitely pay for what you get.   Huge rolls that taste great and more importantly, are fresh!   Atmosphere is always nice however I haven't seen the place \"busy\" yet.   I'll be back often."}
{"text":"3.5 star   Aroowha Sushi & Sake Bar store front looks really plain and uninspiring, I was really pleasantly surprised when I stepped inside. The deco is nice and chic and trendy.. like a downtown hip diva bar instead of a sushi place up in the suburbs.   Lunch Specials has a good selections of Sushi/Sashimi/Teriyaki and some Korean fares. Lunch is served till 3 pm.   Sushi ($11.50) includes salad and miso soup  - Miso soup is really Meh...not too much flavours.. watery and bland  - salad dressing though really nice, critus based balanced with a hint of ginger, one of the better one I have. The salad itself are fresh and crispy  - Sushi fish selections are good and fresh, not all salmon only like a lot of places. The fish itself are not sliced paper thin.. and the shari rice has a good bite.. +1 star  - California Rolls sprinkled with black sesame and sizable with big piece of avocado.. yummy!!   The Sake tasting menu is quite interesting.. I don't mind dropping by next time to have a few.   Korean waitress and staffs were courteous and polite and distant at the same time. But service overall was fast and efficient!   Aroowha Sushi & Sake Bar would be a good place for a romantic dinner date and romance your date over some Japanese food and drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and amazing value lunch means. Their special rolls are fantastic; very tasteful and beautifully crafted. Two thumbs up to the chefs and waitress for very good service. Definitely a place to bring others and come back to."}
{"text":"Aroowha sushi is always packed...which to me means that people like it here! The restaurant is a cozy/decent size but if you are a group of 6 or more I would definitely recommend reservations. The food here is always flavourful and fresh. We have been here about three times and the staff are friendly and don't bother you. They have a lot of options and I always get their yam tempura or the avocado rolls and they never disappoint"}
