{"text":"I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about.  I'm Asian and lived in Vancouver most of my life so I would like to think I know a little about authentic Asian cuisine and this place is certainly not that.  \"General Tao\" and \"authentic\" don't belong in the same sentence together.  :P  Came here for lunch and tried the Pad Thai (not Chinese) and some fried beef dish.   Food was edible, service thorough, but menu caters to a Western crowd."}
{"text":"Absolutely Not!  Yu Hang, You Suck. To start the meal right, the two glasses of water served upon arrival had black specs floating in it.  When we asked for bottled water, they had run out of them.  The Sliced Pork with Garlic Sauce was absolutely disgusting, in fact the pork might have even been off; the vinegar was so strong it would have covered the rotten smell.  I have had this particular dish in many cities around the world including Beijing, China, and know for a fact that the traditional way of preparing this dish would not have even involved vinegar.  After one bite we decided that it was not worth risking our health while on vacation.  And that's just the food itself.  The service was non-existent.  We arrived about one hour before closing time, and were asked to settle our bill before the last course was even brought to the table.  The waiters were counting their tips while there were at least 4 other tables occupied with customers.  The cashier behind the counter had her iPod in while she was cashing out.  I'm not a picky person, and I've eaten in many hole-in-the-wall restaurants around the world and enjoyed myself, but Yu Hang.... never again."}
{"text":"I went to Montreal 2 weeks back during the Jazz festival. The entire trip was amazing but for dinner at Yu Hang which was a DISGUSTING RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, the WATER was UNCLEAN and add to that, the customer service was of the LOWEST QUALITY I have ever experienced across all restaurants I have visited across the world. To start with, we had to wait for 40mins before anyone approached us to take our order, which was ridiculous given that the restaurant was hardly crowded. We ordered 1 soup, 1 appetizer + 4 entrees and waited a further 35 mins post which a different waitress approached us and asked to PLACE AN ORDER AGAIN! At this stage, it was already more than an hour since we had come in and the restaurant was not too crowded so I could not think of a reason why there should be such a delay. This was really RIDICULOUS cause to my UTTER SHOCK, there were THREE SEPARATE TABLES where guests who CAME IN AFTER US were served their entire meal (soup, appetizer and entrees) even before we got 1 item from our order. When asked about the cause of delay, the Manager of the restaurant replied in an EXTREMELY RUDE MANNER that the kitchen is busy and the ONLY OPTION I HAD WAS TO WAIT TILL THEY BRING IN THE FOOD. 5 mins after this (more than 1.5 hours since we first entered), we were served just our soup and there was still NO TRACE OF THE APPETIZERS or the ENTREES. Like I mentioned earlier, this was when 3 other tables with guests who came post us who were served their entire order of soup, appetizers and entrees. At this stage, me, my family and friends asked the waitress to CANCEL the order and said we were leaving. Even then, there was not a SINGLE HINT OF an APOLOGY nor EXPLANATION for the delay. When I was going out, one of the other guests seated in a table near me noticed this incident and asked me if there has been a delay in serving the food and if other guests were served ahead of me. He and his wife mentioned that they had the SAME PATHETIC CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE and that they were also going to follow us out of the place. So to summarize, just AVOID this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty standard I think. I ordered few spicy dishes and seafood seems to be fresh. The price is reasonable and sometime I go there when I want a quieter environment for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that the reviewer above - Houston T. - understood the first reviewer's comments. Jonathan B was trying to say - I imagine - that although you can get americanized chinese food here, it also offers respectable versions of more traditional chinese dishes.  I have been here several times and have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. They don't hold back on the ma-la spicing - my lips are numb everytime I leave!  Here's why I like it:  -First of all, it surprises me. It's a quiet hotel restaurant that looks like nothing special, yet the food and service are both excellent.   -Second, it is a rare opportunity for me to go out for authentic sichuan food and also satisfy other dining companions who aren't so adventurous. I can order Yu Hsiang eggplant or a hot pot while my friends order sesame chicken, and we're strangely both happy. We could go to Cuisine Szechuan to scratch my itch, but the my friends wouldn't be as satisfied.  Plus the atmosphere here is better, with a nice view of the park across the street.   Here's what I've had and enjoyed:  Dry-fried/Four seasons green beans Cumin beef dry-fried spicy beef some noodle dish - maybe wuhan noodles?  I'm not going to say it was \"just like being in China\" but I think it strikes a good balance and delivers on the flavor."}
{"text":"This is one of the few authenic places in town. They also have american Chinese food such as General Tao. Do not go here at lunch unless you want generic Chinese stuff (pad thai, general tao..).    For dinner, you can get the real stuff; I highly recconend you get the boiled szchuan fish, the yutisang eggplant, spicy beef strips. The food is very good at night as long as you order the real Chinese stuff and the price is right."}
