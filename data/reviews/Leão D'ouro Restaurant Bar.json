{"text":"Great Portuguese food and prices are good. Wine prices are fair. It's odd but the pasta is really good!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the family on Sunday. We had a reservation. Place was clean and looked nice on the inside. There was also a large party that came after we had been seated, they were not disruptive and it was fine.  I started with the Shrimp Bisque soup which was great. On the table was olives, several styles of bread, white cheese, as well as an olive oil onion spread which was very good. My main was the grilled halibut with risotto which was grilled perfectly. There were a few of my family members that ordered the Beef a casa and they confirmed that it was cooked perfectly.  I wish the service would be slightly more attentive as they needed a reminder on a couple of occasions for more drinks and bread etc. This may have been a result of the large party, but nonetheless, service was OK.  All-in-all I think the experience was good from start to finish and I will consider again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. In regards of the price is what you can expect for a place where the food is amazing and they treat you above and beyond. Highly recommended for Portuguese food and also with a great wine list."}
{"text":"Best portuguese restaurant in Mississauga. My favorites are the bife a casa and bacalhao a bras. A bit pricey but definitely worth the splurge !"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, both for eat in and take out, and have been satisfied with the food and service eat time. I suggest the steak. There are cheaper places, but for what it is, this one is good to go"}
{"text":"Went tonight with a friend and her husband. Made a reservation for 3. The restaurant is cute, located on Dundas in a building by itself. Ample parking. Would be a nice first date place. The server was friendly. House wine which was quite good was $6.95 by glass. They have a substantial wine list.  The food was great. Really liked the complementary tray of cheese, olives and bruschetta.   I ordered Carne de Porco a Alentejana which is marinated cubes of pork, pan seared with clams, shrimp,  white wine, garlic and coriander which was $22. Very very good. It comes covered in potatoes which were also very good. The portions were great.  Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere which was relaxed. It was a friday night with about 80% of the restaurant full and they weren't rushing anyone.  Will be back :)  Ohhh and it has Wi-Fi!! Awwwwesome!!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. We went on a Saturday night in Aug, around 5:30 and it was pretty packed--several big tables of families. Our group had the octopus appetizer, the grouper, and the cod w/egg, potato, and parsley. Everything was delicious and well-prepared. The fish was super fresh, the cod dish was large enough to split, and the octopus was definitely the highlight of the meal.   The setting is nice enough for a date but also not so formal that you feel like you couldn't bring your family. Dining room has lots of light and is a pleasant place to eat. Nice wine selection. Parking is easy. They also offer a takeout menu with chicken, and nightly specials.   My only quibble: I wish they would turn off the TV in the corner (seriously, why does a nice restaurant like this feel like they have to have a TV going all the time? it's something i associate with eating in an airport restaurant or sports bar)  Afterwards, we took a stroll and window shopped at the big Chinese/Vietnamese outdoor mall next door   Would go to Leao D'ouro again for sure,"}
{"text":"Other than going to Portuguese Chicken places this is the first time that I have visited an authentic Portuguese Restaurant.  I know people may say that there are better places out there but based on my experience this is the place to be for Portuguese cuisine.  We were a large group there for a birthday party which was great but the only down fall is that we had a set menu and were not able to order off the regular menu.  Our evening started off by bringing appetizers spread around the table.  We had shrimps, muscles, chorizo, cheese, olives, calamari, shrimp and beef patties.  The apps alone would have been enough they were amazing especially if you are a fish eater.  After that we had a choice of soup or salad  and when it came to main courses we had 5 or 6 options to choose from.  I had the beef du casa.  that is basically a steak grilled and topped with a sunny side up egg covered in gravy and of course homemade potato chips on the side.  Let me tell you it was amazing.  my meat was a little tough and overcooked but super tasty none the less.    I would really want to give 4.5 stars as they don't deserve to loose a full star just cause my meat was a bit tough and because it was overcooked.  I will be visiting this place very soon and ordering off the regular menu.  I really look forward to it."}
{"text":"Being someone who dines here frequently I tend to forget to notice the great quality in detailing they put into not only their desserts but in all their meals.  When it comes to their sweets everything is simply amazing and done in house. Their chocolate cake is heavenly, simply a must! Pair it with a nice glass of Portuguese vino, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm not sure why everyone is saying the food is so good here, my boyfriend who is Portuguese, was really looking for a good Portuguese restaurant, since the one we used to go to all the time moved locations. The menu looked really nice and had everything we where looking for, however when the food came out it was pretty bad, over cooked, and not very tasty. I ordered the salted cod in olive oil which is usually my favourite,  but they gave me the tail of the fish so I couldn't eat half of it, and it was terribly over cooked, my boyfriend thought his was over cooked also he was not impressed at all, and we haven't been back since. Maybe we will give it another shot since we are still looking for a good Portuguese restaurant close to oakville."}
{"text":"***TIP:  No Lunch Menu on Sundays.  Best to come with a group of at least 2+ people and share or else you are paying $20+pp without wine/dessert!***  White table cloth + wine glasses on table type of place.  No Mario's BBQ here, although atmosphere is neither pretentious nor is the waitstaff snobby.  For any of you who have dined at Aioli, I'd say that this place is the Portuguese version of the Italian standby in Mississauga!  Seems quite authentic as the majority of the diners were Portuguese and came with their families.  I haven't been here in almost a decade, but nice to see that the food is still good & so is the service.  Nice place to go out for dinner to celebrate a special occasion OR if you're Portuguese, take your family there for a traditional Sunday lunch and spend a coupla hours eating, drinking wine, catching up, & watching the soccer game on tv.  We ordered the Bacalau a Bras (sorta like an omelette with cod fish & shoestring potatoes) & Stuffed Chicken Breast (w/ raisins/dried figs).  Both mains were ~$20 and chicken was really good!  The Bacalau was good too, but quite traditional, so if you don't feel like eating an omelette, I'd order something else.  It would've been better for sharing.  Again, nice Portuguese sitdown, good service, & great food at decent prices!"}
{"text":"I ended up at this place because I was outnumbered by my friends who wanted Portuguese food. I'll make this brief, the BBQ chicken was really good but that was it. I did not enjoy my chocolate desert or the service. On a more positive note...a friend was feeling a bit brave and had the grilled Octopus (eww tentacles) but they loved it and so did everyone who sampled it. So if you like to try new things I suggest the octopus :P"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim early evening Saturday.  It's not  casual place but they graciously welcomed us even though we were dressed for a patio.  We tried the grilled veggies ctopus and shredded codfish with a salad to start which was all very tasty.  Surpringsly mellow flavours ate th hits of flavourful marinated tomatoes and olives and the Portuguese corn bread was delicious."}
{"text":"I went to this place twice.  First time I found it average and the second time it was terrible.  Service:  the service was great.  The lady and guy who served us were pretty nice which is expected for a fine dining restaurant  Atmosphere:  this place used to be a bk and I can't get that out of my head  Food:  overpriced garbage.  I ordered steak the first time and honestly found montanas steak better.  Ur better off going to a steak house.  Perhaps my fault for getting non fish/seafood at a Portuguese restaurant.  Second time I ordered the seabass.  Terrible.  It was overcooked.  Tasteless.  Everything Gordon Ramsay would say about a dish.  This place was dead and I should've figured out why.  Honestly.  If you wanted Portuguese food and fine dining this is not the place."}
