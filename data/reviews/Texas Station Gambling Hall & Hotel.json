{"text":"I gave this hotel 2 stars because I did not see any mice, roaches or bed bugs in my room.

The key to staying at this hotel is have your paperwork in order if you don't they will double charge you....that's just the way it is. I booked this hotel through priceline made sure not to give my credit card to the hotel.

Do not give these people your credit card. 

I wanted an early check-in but they wanted to charge me an additional $14.95 resort fee for checking in before 11am. The resort fee is an additional $14.95 per night. I waited until 11am to check in.

The resort fee is for internet service in your room supposedly...I believe it's just a way for the hotel to make more money.

When I did check in the woman at the front desk tried to charge me for 5 night resort fee when I only paid for 4 nights through price line. I had to correct her by showing her my price line paperwork.

I used cash for $100 refundable incidental deposit and the 3 night resort fee which was slightly under $60.

They tried to put me in a handicapped room (don't know why) but I requested a regular room instead.

During check in if you don't correct these people early they will double charge you or give you a terrible room. I still ended up with a really bad room.

The room I had was in the basement the window view was an outside wall. The bathtub was clogged with hair an green slimy stuff. I tried to pour bleach in it to unclog it but that did not work. The bathroom sink had hair in it. The carpet looked old dingy and dirty.

The entire room reeked of cigarette smoke.

The buffet was bad.....for some reason it looked like the food had been sitting out all day without being stirred or freshened up or replace and it was not cheap.  Dinner cost $12. 

I didn't complain to management about my experience at the hotel I didn't think they would do anything about it......according to the other reviews I read.

It's a cheap ran down smelly hotel.....at least I wasn't double charged. It's not the maid fault that the rooms are ran down."}
{"text":"This is not the place to stay if you're trying to spend your time on the strip, cause it's waaayy off the strip.  Sadly, it just wasn't that kind of trip for me this time.  I stayed here for a family event and I was pleasantly surprised, considering the reasonable room rate.  The rooms were nice, the place was well run, clean, and the staff was really cool. 

The casino floor is huge, and they have tons of penny slots which cracked me up; you're just not going to see that on the strip!  

We went to the buffet at Feast and GRUBBED.  You gotta love a place that lets me have okra, beet salad, catfish, chow mein, greens, fried rice, ribs and pasta!"}
{"text":"I think when you stay at any station casino you aren't exactly a Vegas high roller who expecting the red carpet to be rolled out- but in many areas the Texas barely scored better than a Super 8 motel stay.  

Here are a few of the greatest hits:
1. The tub was filthy. Not surface dirty, but that deep down grime that only elbow grease gets out. We know, because my wife scrubbed it clean.

2. The vent had caked on dust and lint. Like- no one had EVER cleaned it before dust and lint. All the surfaces were equally dirty. Just running your hand on the sink top felt like you were caressing volcanic rock- all the built up grime creating the craters. Horrid and seriously uncool. 

3. Pillows please. King size bed came with 3 pillows standard. We called down for 3 more (wife and I both sleep with 3 each). We were told we could only have 2 more pillows. That it was their policy - only two extra!  

4.  On an 8 night stay, our sheets were only fully swapped on night 6, and only because I stripped the bed. I forgot to strip the pillow cases off- so those we had for all 8 nights. 

Would I stay again?  No. 

Overall the other staff (casino, security, Starbucks) were great, but if you are overnighting: stay across the street at the Fiesta."}
{"text":"The place has not changed at all after a 20 year gap.  Like me just older and not aging well.  I had stayed at a sister hotel and was impressed with that hotel for the money.  So I decided to give Texas a retry.  The sheets were clean but the overall room was not.  There was little smell of cigarette smoke in the room until I took a shower.  Also the floors were dirty, fixtures corroded, and mold. The room needed a thorough cleaning. I ate at the coffee shop for dinner and the service was above average.  The food was ok.  I had breakfast at the buffet.  I am gluten free and actually walked away full.  A good balanced breakfast.  Last fyi, there is no secured parking for guests, but the reservation person was kind enough to tell me where the security cameras were. All in all I felt safe staying here. Which at the downtown hotels has not always been the case."}
{"text":"ok the buffet is terrible. there was a cockroach running around like he owned the place near the omelette station. this place is pretty dead."}
{"text":"We love Station Casinos all over Vegas!   We are regulars.   Don't expect any southern hospitality at Texas Station- this is the worst one we have visited and the ONLY Station casino who's employees consistently have a bad attitude and are nasty to their guests.   Try next door at Fiesta for a great time!"}
{"text":"This Hotel is awful! I checked in for a 3 night stay only to find the room in a state of completely unsanitary to say the least. Immediately upon entering the room I noticed a lot of debris on the carpet and brown stains and spills on the wall paper. There was crushed potato chips on the telephone and the furniture and lamp shades were badly damaged and in need of some serious repair or replacing not to mention the view was that facing a brick wall. I immediately called FD and informed them of the issues. Chris the agent was very apologetic and asked if he could room move me which I accepted. As I was on my way to meet friends for dinner I told Chris I would pick up keys to the new room later in the evening when I return from dinner. 

I hung up the phone to proceed to bathroom to get ready for my evening when I saw the condition of the bathroom. Literally there were urine stains on BOTH sides of the toilet base, hair on top of the toilet, hair on the floor, hair in the sink and hair in the shower. My stomach literally turned!! I immediately went to the FD to check out! I was no longer interested in occupying ANY of There rooms! I spoke to Chris at the FD and showed him all the pictures of the room. He apologized again saying \"oh I'm sorry this is bad\". Although Chris did not have the authority to refund my nights he gave me the contact info for the Hotel Director Roberto and asked me to call in the morning for the refund and he would make all the notations in my account. I occupied this disgusting room for 30mins! When I spoke to Roberto the next day he didn't once offer any type of apology. He just listened to my experience, put me on hold, and then returned to say he would only be refunding me 2nights and would be charging me for 1 night being that I declined to room move???? I could NOT believe what I wad hearing! I also work I'm Hotel Management so I could not believe Roberto handled this so poorly. It was his staff that failed to provide a clean and sanitary room, and yet somehow it's MY fault and I must pay for walking in and declining to do business with them? I informed Roberto that I would be contacting someone higher in position as I would definitely will not be paying for some place I did not stay as a result of there incompetence. I was not only late for my dinner reservations with my friends as a result of this, but I also found my self at 9pm with no place to stay for the next 3days. I needed to now try to rebook hotel reservations elsewhere in the middle if the night. Roberto really seemed as if he could care less only saying \"well there's no one else to talk to I'm the highest up\" I informed him I would be contacting the Corp. office, which I immediately did after ending our conversation. When I spoke with Station casinos Corp. office the polite women listened to me and informed me that Roberto was not the highest level on property and there was a General Manager I could speak with. She gave me his contact info and his secretary~ Sofia's number and said she was certain they could help me. I contacted Sofia who was very polite and apologetic, and said although the GM was in meetings all day, she would get with Roberto and see what happened and would be contacting me back that day. She did! Sofia later said that when she contacted Roberto, he said he was refunding all 3 nights and I wouldn't be charged for anything! I thanked Sofia for her prompt assistance. But that's when the nightmare began....my credit card would go on to be charged, and the partially refunded, only to be charged again, and then partially refunded, and then literally charged a 3rd time!!!! In the end, I still paid for 1 night at the Texas!! No full refund was ever given. It has been 3wks. And nothing. After this terrible experience Texas had the nerve to charge me 1night room, tax and resort fee for minutes of me being inside there disgusting room. My booking agent is still investigating but EVERYTIME they contact Texas, there are told I won't be charged!! But the reality is I have been charged....repeatedly!! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT book here....what a nightmare!!!! I am trying to upload my pictures of the horrible condition of the room but somehow am unable to on Yelp? I will upload the pictures on Trip Advisor!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for providing a family stay at Texas Station.  Trish at check in met all of our request and room accommodations, very nice, informative, and efficient, making our check in experience smooth.

{"text":"This review only relates to the Oyster Bar at Texas Station.

Their decision to do away with the \"lunch portions\" will result in the elimintion of their lunch business.

Dumb!"}
{"text":"We have stayed at the Texas Station in the past and it's a decent hotel for the price but last week we had a booking issue that prevents me from returning.  We were called on our arrival day and told that the 4 rooms we booked were not available and that we had been moved to a sister hotel 20 miles away.  We accepted the situation but we had two nights and did not want to have to move between hotels.  Hotel reservations at the Texas Station told us that we would need to speak with the manager Amalia Armen to get our prepaid room transferred to the sister hotel - but that she was in a meeting and could not talk with us at the time.  We left a message but never got a return phone call.  The sister hotel even tried to handle this for us but Amalia's solution was to dodge the conversation.  Not the kind of \"hospitality\" I'm looking for when I stay at a hotel."}
{"text":"This is our local gambling place.  They have one of the best rewards programs I've found.  The casino floor isn't so crowded that you feel like you are sitting on top of the group next to you - but close enough to enjoy if someone close let's out a scream for a hit.  Contrary to one of the reviews, we've consistently found the smoke level low in the casino and the smokers very polite in checking to see if you would be bother.  I agree that the buffet isn't going to set the world on fire - but for $5 where can you get a drink, custom made omelet and sweet for dessert?  And as to the comment regarding the age of the gamblers - I see more people younger than I am playing and I haven't left my 50's yet.

Next time you are in town - sit down, try a game (don't always play maxi) and converse with a local - most of them are pretty darn nice."}
{"text":"The hotel is a great value for those staying in Las Vegas. It is north of Las Vegas, so a little bit of a drive from the Strip. Fine, if you have a car. The room itself was pretty nice. No smells, spacious, unlike other rooms I've stayed at in Vegas. The sheets, like another commenter noted, there is no duvet. Just two flat sheets with a fleece blanket. The fan works well. You have to put your card (or any card) into the socket near the door to activate the electricity.

They loose a star due to the internet situation being confusing. You have it free in the casino, so just make it free in the rooms, unlike this Cox Hospitality business. My advice? If you want to use the internet? Just go into the main casino. It's completely free there.

They also give you free slot play when you join the club ($3-$500). Of course, got the $3. It's confusing on how to use it, but basically it reimburses you for the money sort of... But the card is of better value for the buffet, which gives you discount. For breakfast, you can't beat $5 buffet... See the buffet review for more info."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good staff are on it when it comes to picking up plates, took kids our first time visiting Texas Station Casino, has arcade, cinema inside, the kids had a good time. Definitely coming back, by unanimous vote we give this place 4 stars, thanks nieces and nephews for your participation."}
{"text":"I like the Texas Station.
Compared to the Strip Casinos it is very relaxed and laid back here."}
{"text":"No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities."}
{"text":"This review is for Craps only.  I arrived here last Friday night around 6 P.M. and the craps table was empty.  Here I was thinking WTF is going on?  How can one of the more profitable table games be empty on such a busy night?  I jump on the table and make a few bets and start me roll.  I dabble in controlled shooting, but most casinos don't really care if players set the dice.  NOT HERE!  After my first set of rolls (pit boss is watching the whole time) I hit my point and they switch stick-men.  The new stick-man stares at the pitboss, and as I'm starting my roll puts his stick out over the rail and in front of my shot... My dice hit his stick and I seven out.  I then politely ask if he can move his arm back just a little bit, as I'm not able to shoot around him.  He yells at me, saying that he needs to put his stick out to protect himself from the players and I can either step back, or leave the table....  I took my chips off the table and cashed out.  No wonder no one plays craps here.  If your looking for a good time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Found a good deal on Travelocity. But treated with contempt by staff and charged additional $15 at the desk as part of the a MANDATORY basic package fee. Not impressed with their business model. Will not be staying here again."}
{"text":"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel to attend the wedding of a family member. The hotel staff greeted us and provided excellent customer service. After checking in, we thought \"Hey, this place seems alright.\" WRONG!!!!!!!

First, the room: We requested a non-smoking room and got one, but It was filled with smoke the entire stay, leaving me, my mom and my husband with horrible headaches. We smelled like 3 smoke stacks on the way home and forcing us to have to take our luggage directly to the laundry room to be washed when we got home. Now, our car has the glorious smell of smoke. 

The toilet in our room made a horrendous sound upon flushing that would scare the living daylights out of you. The sink made a sound as to indicate a possible clog in the drain. 

The furniture in the room looked like it had been purchased from a junk yard. It was filthy. 

The walls in the room are paper thin providing us with the play-by-play conversations of the guests in the rooms next door. 

The elevators: Ride at your own risk! They both seem like they could use some much needed maintenance. 

The hallways: Hot as hell! No a/c blowing so you feel as though you are holding your breathe until you get to the elevators. 

The wedding ceremony and reception were absolutely wonderful and we had a great time until we went back to our smoke-filled room."}
{"text":"I went to the bowling alley for my sons birthday! They reserved our alleys like I had asked which was great! But the computers were outdated and kept breaking down the bowling alley employees had great customer service. And overall the bowling experience was great. We also orders pizzas and wings with drinks to eat and the food was good however the service was bad idk if they were overwhelmed with the amount of people that were there. But they were extremely rude."}
{"text":"This place is all right! 
As we are primarily video poker players, it really doesn't get much better than Texas Station. http://static3.px.yelp.com/photo/EdHm2gXRR-IqKLdatxIkfQ/l  
The pay tables are excellent, the machines are clean, seats are comfortable, and the cocktail service is friendly and attentive. Music is decent and at a good level and the crowd is primarily local, which is great. 
With a rental car we were able to visit from the strip several times, at a much lower cost than taxis and self parking is well-lit and easily accessible. 
Would we stay here?  No, not our kind of place.  
Will we continue to play here?  No doubt about it!
And again, FATBURGER!"}
{"text":"This is a very conveniently located and friendly location.  The staff here are very attentive and helpful as well as courteous to newcomers.  I have brought several friends over with me and they were very welcoming even though I was the only paying customer those visits.  Also their buffet is very easy on the wallet for visitors or people you want to treat on a regular basis."}
{"text":"As we are sitting in the parking lot waiting for the rest of our party to meet us apparently it is a problem according to Paul who worked there. Even though there is no sign posted!!! We are now at another casino because if we cannot sit there and wait for our friends I do not want to ever go there. Thank you Paul for losing money from about ten people that were going to have a good night at the Texas!!"}
{"text":"I just got done eating breakfast and the food is great. However, today I had the worst server that bussed my table. First off, it's pretty hot outside and I'm sure people like cold refreshing beverages. She brought me some orange juice with no ice and I'm not gonna drink anything that isn't cold. I went up to get some more food, come back and my table is cleared?? Secondly, the servers aren't supposed to bus a table until the people are finished eating. I find it rude and I told the manager about the situation and she really didn't handle the problem right. She herself grabbed a plate of food and started eating. I usually get better service than this... Station Casinos need to pay a little bit more attention to what their doing. I like the buffet, but the waitress was dumb as hell ! If you guys want tips, do your jobs right... However, you guys don't need any tips because I'm pretty sure they make enough money and I'd say they make at least up to $10 an hour for their job. Other than that the food is good and I love the omelettes."}

{"text":"Texas Station is cool with me for three reasons:

1. Lack of scene. If you're mediocre on the strip, you are smokin' here.  When I'm feeling unattractive, this is my go-to spot.

2.  No customers.  Sometimes, I hate people and want to be far away from them all.  This place is deserted.  So, thanks, Texas Station, for contributing to my misanthropy.

3.  Everything under one roof.  Theaters, bowling alley, oyster bar, sub par buffet, Dairy Queen, a ballroom where I once spent three hellish days, and a gift shop.  If I ever decide to pull a Howard Hughes, I'm going here."}

Last night, there were idiots making huge noise at 1 am and the security never showed up. Seriously? 

I learned my lesson. I just wrote Groupon and demanded my money back. Stay the heck away especially if you family."}

{"text":"Super cheap breakfast. I forgot to mention you get what you pay for. Las Vegas Known for late night deals. With 6 dollar steak and eggs and 3 dollar burger and fries. We were in for a wake up call. Service was great, bad timing though, they were apparently cleaning the grill. It took us almost an hour to get our food.Dried steak that should have been called beef jerky and eggs. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. I couldn't even tell it was steak and it had lots of chewy pieces. My friends burger was cold and looked like a mcdouble from mcDonalds. The advertised quarter pounder was not impressive. For a few bucks more save your gas and spends the extra dough on something of better quality."}
{"text":"Not as great as I'd remembered. I went there to see a movie recently with my girlfriend, when the movie started it was us and another couple in the theater. By the time the movie had ended, half the theater was full. All those movie hoppers going in and out of the theater as it was playing were pretty distracting. Damn kids! The government really should make it mandatory to get a license to breed. If you want to have kids, you should have to fill out an application, get a background check, etc. And only two kids per couple like it is in China. Also, any time a woman is knocked up without first applying to have a child should get a mandatory abortion. 
Two stars because they do have Yellow Brick Road on Saturdays, a great band."}

{"text":"I've only gambled at the Texas casino I haven't stayed in their rooms. I love gambling here. The atmosphere is always on point and always win some little extra money to go shopping at the outlets.  As long as you're gambling the drinks keep on coming. The only down side is if they don't have enough personnel some gambling tables are not open. For example last night (Sunday) they had 2 craps tables open. One was completely f the other one only half of it was open because they didn't have enough personnel. But other than that I rather gamble at the Texas than the strip."}
{"text":"Not much of a gambler but their buffet is above average considering the price. It's also not far from where I live which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I had a bad feeling from the moment we checked in. We received horrible service. The front counter rep wouldn't even make eye contact, was rude and not help full at all. We had a room on the 5th floor and it was a long walk down the hall. OK, but we had to go downstairs 2 times because our room keys would not work. We didn't even get a \"sorry for the inconvenience\". We asked for a non-smoking room and it smelled like 5 people had just been smoking in there. The elevators where very noisy and extremely slow. The elevator doors would open on the wrong floor all the time. The Casino was pretty dirty. We were there a couple of days and every where we sat to play the slots there would be cigarette butts and dirty ash trays. No one was going buy to pick them up and clean. Even if I were a smoker i would want to use a clean tray. We also never once got to order from the cocktail girls. They were never around. We got wrong directions from a couple of the employees about the casino. We were looking for particular bars to take advantage of the specials they had but kept walking back and forth because no one seemed to know where it was We had breakfast at their Coco's and no joke, we waited 6 minutes to be seated, and 13 minutes to at least ask for our coffee. It was not busy, only 4 tables were occupied including ours. I am the type of person that can deal with all of the above, except the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"If I could give no starts I would!! WORST BUFFET customer service there is. The so called \"manager\" Maria Inez was extremely rude, cursing , and talking down on the customers!!! In front of many customers that were in line to enter she was cursing in Spanish and yelling at another customer. She was also treating him like he didn't have money after He had paid in full. She was telling him she was going to call security if her bill wasn't taken care of and that she specifically told the customer in front of everyone that she didn't care what he had to say because it wasn't her problem and that all she cared about was getting her money. That is disgusting of a so called manager. When they asked her who was her manager she ignored the customer and refused to give them their name. I hope that they call corporate on her!!!!!"}

{"text":"Overnight at Texas Hotel Station. It's not one of those 5 star hotels along the Las Vegas Strip that has all the amenities. For about $150 a night including taxes and resort fees, I find the price quite expensive. The hotel room is spacious and clean. But they don't have fee coffee or free breakfast like what most hotels offer. I was given a room at the first floor and I don't have a good view. This hotel has many restaurants. I had my breakfast at Cafe Grande. I ordered fried catfish and eggs and find their price also quite pricey! The food is not bad but not also great.  I liked their Dallas Ballroom where the event took place. It's spacious and accommodate all the vendors and guest. Parking is free. Overall my experience is good."}
{"text":"I didn't stay here, I don't want to stay here ... but I had a theory that older casinos, catering to less affluent folks, may have frequent pay-outs.  (If you read my review about another tired casino, you'll see that I find it fun to win even a couple of cents when I pull the lever.  Clearly, I'm no gambler.)

I was right!  I kept winning ten cents here, a dollar there!  I was pleased.  What made me particularly happy was Texas Station's frozen margaritas.  Pretty darned good!  (I don't think patrons at this casino regularly tip the barmaids.  The gal who helped us was overly effusive about our gratuity.)

The one downside of the casino floor: skeevy men kept hitting on my daughter, one even handing her a drink.  (Like she's going to take a drink from a stranger!)

While I would never make this place my haunt, I'll probably come back to play the slots on my next trip.  My daughter probably will not."}
{"text":"Texas is no way near as polished as the strip casino's and has way less tourists (like me). Excellent for some undisturbed 
roulette. Loved playing old skool bingo in the even more old skool hall. Staff is very friendly. The place feels real, no frills."}
{"text":"This review is based on the food buffet and the bowling alley.  Me and my husband went there on a Sunday.  We did not have to stand in line too long and it wasn't crowded either.  We were seated pretty quickly and then we immediately started our trip around the buffet.  

There wasn't much of a variety of foods and it was around 3pm and they still had old crusty dry breakfast food out.  There wasn't any fried chicken, fish, shrimp, etc available.  All I got was some barbeque chicken, slice of pizza, taco, salad, sausage and peppers.  The food was pretty good however there just wasn't enough variety for me like at Boulder Station.

This is probably the last place I would come if I wanted to come to a buffet but I would try them out again if I just had to.

Now the bowling was pretty fun and awesome.  We bowled 3 games and rented 2 pairs of shoes for about $32.00.  Not too bad for a Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't crowded and they had a lot of the lanes blocked off because of a bowling league.  We also quenched our thirst with the $.99 cent Margaritas.  They aren't too strong but pretty good for the price.  Me and my family always come here and it's usually 20 of us so it was nice to have just the 2 of us playing. 

Of course I will be returning to the bowling alley as it is always fun fun fun."}
{"text":"Texas Station or bust -I'LL TAKE BUST

TEXSH#T Station - I use Yelp all of the time, but have never before left a review.  I am writing this one while in my room at Texas Station.  PLEASE heed my warning and don't stay here!  This place is disgusting!  There is a stench outside of raw sewage that permeates throughout the hotel and smells sooooo bad it was hard to sleep in the room with window shut and AC running.  We were forced to stay here with son's hockey team and even for one night it is AWFUL!!!!!!  Spoke to the manager and he ignored me and said I am only one who complained of the stench.  I doubt it since every parent on our team has complained when they step outside how awful the smell is.  The sink, tub and shower  have such slow drains that you are standing in 6 inches of water before you realize that yes, the drain is open!  If there was actually any water pressure, tub and sink would overflow before water drained out.    They ought to implode this place, but it is in such a bad area that no one would buy the property!  Any positive reviews are obvious plants by hotel staff.  Y'all Come Back Now - I think NOT..."}
{"text":"When checking in, Trisha, was so rude and smug. She would not allow me to use the card they had on file, which was my husbands (as we were just advised over the phone we could use and i had the actual card in hand.) So i had to use my card. Thankfully on check out, i had Victoria, who was very nice and helpful. 

Other than this, our bathroom was not very clean. There was pubic hair on the floor. Do not waste your money on the buffet. Go to tue Grand Cafe instead. Food is better. 

I'll end on a good note. I wish i got his name, but the older gentelman bartender who worked the night shift on 8/16-17/17, was great. He rememberd our drinks when we came back the next night. Also, housekeeping was quick to get us towels. i am on the fence about staying here again."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed and disgusted in the room they gave us. First of all, there were no non-smoking rooms available at the time. Upon check-in, I inspected the bathroom and found the following: 1) a strand of pubic hair on the soap next to the sink faucet, 2) another strand of pubic hair on the sink countertop, 3) soap on the bathtub towel that was reused as it was dry but the wrapping looked as if it got wet prior, 4) water on the bathroom floor by the tub b/c I accidentally stepped in it, and 5) strands of hair under the comforter sheets! 

After disclosing the uncleanliness of the room to Donna, who checked us in at the front desk, she did not show the least ounce of apology or shame. She informed us that there were no rooms available for the night and to try again in the morning. I felt disgusted that I had to sleep in that room that night. Fortunately, in the morning, another agent was able to find an open room and relocate us. This room was much cleaner than the previous one. This establishment gets ONE STAR, for the 2 complimentary buffet tickets given for our troubles.

If you're on a budget, take your chances in staying here. As for us, we'll splurge a little more next time and stay on the strip in a better quality hotel."}
{"text":"worst customer service ever. this place deserves negative stars. not to mention the hints of racism because my parents couldnt speak english to their preference. went through 4 different reps before they could fix a simple problem."}
{"text":"Neisha at the Registration desk is terrific! Many thanks go to her! - Joann Ross at Lucix, Director of Quality Assurance! Suggestion: you will get more business with more Neisha's around!"}
{"text":"Well they have an arcade...

The arcade is fun and super cheap and if you take a movie ticket stub they give you $5 a stub to play in the arcade :) (not sure if this in an ongoing thing) we were excited to see a bunch of skeetball machines (our fav). 

We each played on our free credits there for it seemed like forever :) husband and I then pulled out winning tickets together and got a prize, it was a little colorful spinning top  filled with water and fish (or something). 

Anyway if you want to smell like smoke for the next century or check out a movie in an uncomfortable but regular priced run down theater, then get free arcade play go here. 

Otherwise...enjoy the $8.99? Syco provided buffet and drink all you can drink at the penny slots...or don't (just like we didn't). 

Oh and I think they have a food court."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The room was clean, but there are a LOT of undesirables here, and the walls are paper-thin, I could hear the lady next door talking about buying her grandchildren chocolate through the walls!  The tv changed on its own, and the staff was unprofessional, would not recommend."}
{"text":"I have had disappointing cheap buffets in Las Vegas before. And ive had amazing ones that emptied my wallet...The Feast at Texas Station hit a high middle ground . Very good food , Wide array if choices , at an extremely affordable cost."}
{"text":"The Texas Station is part of the old guard of Station Casinos.  There's a new school crop including Green Valley Ranch, Red Rock and Aliante.  This place definitely ain't in that league.  At the same time it's not the worst locals casino I've been to.

Texas Station isn't really a destination spot.  I can't imagine saying \"I've gotta go watch the game at Texas Station\" when there are so many other options.  You literally have to live right next to the place for it to have any kind of appeal.  There is a movie theatre inside, which is pretty decent.  I think I saw Oceans 12 there.  And in a moment of being a cheap bastard, I actually stayed here once when visiting Vegas for a weekend from San Diego.  Room must have cost me less than $50.

The bigger draw seems to be events.  Election night parties and job fairs are common at Texas Station.  They have a pretty decent sized convention/meeting area which must be cheaper than some of the more A-list places in town.  There's almost always some D-list live band playing at the wannabe club zone.  I think it was called the Armadillo last I remember.

You have dozens of better options than Texas Station, but at least you won't be grossed out when hanging out here."}
{"text":"Crikey! What an awesome feeling to be recognized by name or by your choice of drink. He he he he. This is my favorite Station Casino and although it's due to the close proximity to my home, it also has much to do with how they treat me. I truly love Texas Station due to how they take good care of me, an exhausted Strip casino employee.

I have come here for several years for two reasons; they treated my mother like gold and I am able to kick back and decompress here. 

The various bars are hosted by really cool barkeeps that know you by name or recognize you as you walk by. From the Martini Bar to the Sports Bar, these guys know how to take good care of the customer. I am speaking more of how they interact with their customer than how they make a drink. They genuinely chit chat with their regular customers like a friend. 

It's not fair to mention names because everyone from the security department ensuring you find your vehicle to the IM department keeping everything clean and sanitary is here for ONE reason, to keep you happy. 

Yes, I love the Strip and it's awesome and distinct properties, yet, there's something about the Texas Station experience that keeps locals coming back regularly. They treat you like gold!

Texas Station has various restaurants and a wide selection of fast food joints. They have a movie theater, bowling alley, a Fun Zone for kids, and slot machines that have paid the electricity bill in the past. 

In my opinion employees like Shawn from the Sports Bar and Marty from their \"We Love Locals\" commercials exemplified the quality of customer service. Once again I hate and apologize for mentioning names. 

The Fertitta brothers have truly honored their parents in keeping up the old school standards. Thank you Texas Station employees!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Feast buffet inside the Texas station casino...first off its pretty cheap, second the staff is great and very helpful..we love the Mexican food station..love the carnitas..their rice is very good...they have a few stations...Italian..American...Chinese..but Mexican was the station for me...I tried the fried chicken..usually my fav food..this was freshly made so I hoped that they would be great but it was just ok..skip the dessert..not worth the calories..all in all though a good experience.."}
{"text":"We had a cricket in our room and we kick it out. My brothers room had a horrible sewage problem and had to get a new room. Room stunk like sewage. 

Idk. We had mixed service some great and some horrible."}
{"text":"I was staying with my boyfriend while I was in town. The room was great and clean. I would have given five if they had coffee pots in the room, but the Texas removed all the coffee pots because of fire risk. The front desk lady said that there was a Starbucks around the corner, if we really wanted coffee. Other than missing the coffee pot, it's a great place. The bowling alley is open late and when you check in you get a coupon for a free game."}
{"text":"The buffett kept me thinking of the movie, Super-size Me, because everything was so salty, deep fried, or swimming in gravy; Although I must give Texas Station kudos for serving Menudo; again the Menudo was way too salty. I ended up skipping the buffett and settling for the Grand Cafe where I had omlets. My room made me think of what a half-way house must be like. Do not expect pillow-top mattresses or chocolates. I had to call the front desk three days in a row before the plumber showed up with a bottle of Draino-O to unclog the face bowl drain! I would have checked out after day one but I was attending a class nearby and my room was pre-booked. There was a dog obedience conference held at the hotel while I was there. Some of my classmates complained of dogs barking and crying all night!  What ever you do, I suggest not considering this place for a honeymoon otherwise you may end-up getting annulled in the morning-enuff said :-("}
{"text":"Cool place. Way off the strip, north Vegas but I stayed for work so I didn't care. The rooms were a good size, lots of places to eat and few bars around the casino. I enjoyed my time here for sure. Most the staff I came across was low key chill."}
{"text":"This is for the buffet only at Texas Station.  My relatives come here to gamble.  But I was just there for the food, at lunch.  They take me trhough the long line.  Since they are frequent gamblers, my meal was about $7.00 with a frequent gambling card.  I honestly don't know how much it is for the non gambling types, probably other reviewers will say.

This buffet is huge - twice the size of neighboring Fiesta Station's buffet. It must be about 100 feet long. I decided to walk and see what was there before making choices.  Nice American section which was the largest.  They had a slab of roast beef and ham, so you wait in line to get a cut.  Or, you can have them make you a chargrilled hamburger, or grill your self-created burrito in the Mexican section.  I had no patience for any of that.  First plate - They had a decent barbecue section, and I got some ribs with collards, cole slaw, and corn on the cob with some fried rice and orange chicken from the next door Chinese section.  They had some good hot and sour soup, but there is also a soup section next to the Mexican section. Back to the BBQ section, my sister had some of the pulled pork, it was was good. 

Most everything was good.  I didn't go to their large salad bar which had things like pear halves and various lettuces, fresh fruit (watermelon and cantaloupe) and pre made salads.  Surprisingly, that was the least busy area.

They had a Cajun section with fish and seafood gumbo with dirty rice.  They even had hush puppies and corn fritters but I didn't try any. So, for plate number 2, I decided to get fried chicken which was just OK and more vegetables.  And,t the vegetables were good - glazed yams, steamed beans, and more collards again. I also got some penne pasta with a meatball and sauce.  

In light of my doctor's command that I minimize my time and volume eating at buffets (geez there are a LOT of happy but big bodied eaters here!) I stopped at plate 2 and opted for some desserts.  The 20 different pies, cookies, and cakes looked good, and there were even some no sugar added creations.  But I decided on eating two of the mousse in a cup - one was vanilla cream with chocolate, the other was cream with a strawberry glze.  Thank God they only came in 3 oz. containers, it was rich and probably bad for you.  I also had a red velvet cupcake - kind of dry but pretty. 

My eyes wanted to try more things, but maybe we can go again soon. It was time to gamble before heading home.  It might sound like this is like Hometown Buffet, but really, the food is way better and there is greater variety.

One thing I hate about Vegas casinos, though, is all the smoking in the casino.  So if that bugs you, beware.  Also, it you're with someone who uses a cane, ask them if they'd prefer getting pushed in a wheelchair.  They also have valet parking. This place is huge and is a challenge for those who can't walk a quarter mile by the time you park, go to the buffet, and walk back out to the car."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Everything in one place (hotel dining gaming bowling theatre shop etc)
Customer service, friendly staff (some not so much)
Free parking
Bowling was fun

Expensive for the quality of the room  $78 my goodness!!!
Non smoking rooms were unavailable!!!!!!!
Room was stink, dirty, light bulb was out
Shower trickles water
No in room fridge
Food was blaaaah 
Can't call in food to pick up downstairs
No room service

I wouldn't stay there again :("}

Well i spent $80 on the 1 cent slot and never saw a waitress..! I waited for 2 hrs! I guess at this hotel customer service is not an important factor!  Never coming back here AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because the casino manager was nice. But yeahhhhh, don't think I will be back here anytime soon. Our room I though was ok until I noticed a few things that bothered me. One the smell, it's as if someone was chain smoking in there. Two, the bed was not comfortable. Three, like most yelp review mention the shower head in the bathroom needs help. Four, I had ( I won't say what ) crawl on my face at 745am and that was the last straw! Management team handled it as best as they can but that that point I don't think anything can change my mind I WAS DONE!!!!!!. Really wanted to like this place but it's just not for me. I had to many expectations and I think that is where I messed up! Ohh  yeah, the buffet spot was good but that still didn't make up for the other stuff."}
{"text":"Booked a room online.  Get a call two days later and the day before I arrive to inform me that I didn't have a room.  They inform me that no room is available and they booked me in a sister property.  The problem is the sister property was 20 miles away.  I asked if there was a sister property closer by.  They said no available rooms.  

A friend decided to join me in Vegas and booked a room not 20 minutes earlier in their sister property (Palace Station) that was 5 miles away and closer to the Strip.  

Not Happy.  

I ended up booking another hotel at about the same rate and literally 1/2 mile from their sister
Property. 

Needless to say, I will not be staying at any Station property in the future."}
{"text":"Stayed here a couple days after Christmas 2017.  
Kinda crummy, clean enough rooms, but crummy, not enjoyable. 
No refrigerator or coffee maker in room.  No USB or connections for PC devices. Bathroom sinks gurgle loudly as they drain (both times I've stayed here in different rooms).  Could hear noisy neighbors in the next room quite clearly.  Oh MY!   
The Gideons have not been here, or placed a Bible in the nightstand.
Previous guest had put plastic bag over the smoke detector, apparently to smoke something in the room (these types of guests).  
The pool is like the one in your backyard, small, shallow (4 feet deep), and ugly, surrounded by block wall next to the parking lot.
BUT, if you like BOWLING, they have a big bowling alley!  
Bare bones rooms.  No room service food.  Buffet gets a C+.  
Casino is just ok.  Mainly took my money.  
Bar tender at the \"Cadillac El Dorado\" bar had a bad attitude and seemed to hate his job. Gruff.   
Locals like this place due to less tourists and IT's CHEAP.  
It's quite a distance from the \"Strip\" area in a not-so-great neighborhood on Rancho Drive north of the \"Downtown\" Casino area.
Main Street Station is better; at least they have a brewery and restaurant that is good.  I wouldn't recommend Texas Station.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Well first off it was really cheap...really really cheap.
Forty bucks a night for a double, on a Thursday at that.
The down side is that is was quite the drive from the strip, a much longer one then i thought it would be.
The rooms are fantastic though!
Clean and huge :)
The buffet was mediocre but still satisfying, it was cheap so if your on a budget it gets the job done.
There was a seafood restaurant that i really wanted to try but never made it to.
As far as the gambling goes...i didn't win much but who really dose?"}
{"text":"I was really against staying here, but booked the room in advance without doing any looking into. It was better than I was expecting. Just like almost any casino in vegas, it smells like cigarette. I don't even smoke and I didn't think it was the worst. Some people are little princesses.

We got a non-smoking room on the 6th floor. Room was surprisingly clean and didn't smell of smoke. Bathroom including toilet and bathtub were also clean. Halls were quiet and well air-conditioned. You can hear a few conversations as you walk to your room, but once inside, silence; no disturbances. Not the best view, window looked out to the wall of another building. The elevators...well, they're elevators. Not the fanciest, but who complains about elevators?

Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Payed everything in cash so i wouldn't have to deal with being over-charged or double-charged. No problems there. Didn't bother checking out the bowling alley or the pool...who wants to swim in a pool located on the garage level?...not me. Lots of slot machines to gamble away on.

Stay away from the café!! Food was disgusting. Old, stale, probably microwaved. I wouldn't wanna check out the buffet either. They have a small food court further down past a steakhouse and oyster bar that looked pretty nice.

For vegas, yes, not the nicest hotel you can stay in. But for someone looking for a cheap room off the strip, it's not that bad. (About a 10 min drive to vegas strip) Not trying to spend my whole trip in a hotel room anyway."}
{"text":"This is a review of both the hotel and the casino. 

It's a bit old but still decent. 

The crowd that frequents this place are locals and old. 

People don't come here to see or be seen as you can tell by their everyday fits.

The food is decent at the buffet you'll have fun without breaking the bank. 

It's easy to get in and out of and check in is a cinch. I've only stayed here once and for less than a night. Caught some rapid eye movement and showers then hit the road again. I can't truly complain as it was a comped room and I received free play just for checking in. 

It was a win win really. 

I probably wouldn't stay here again unless they complete an extreme overhaul. 

The casino is small and there are some sketchy looking people that hang around for the free drinks while playing 1 cent every ten minutes... So obvious lol!"}
{"text":"This place is okay, and I'd consider staying again under the right circumstances.

I was at a conference, and the conference was at the hotel.  There were two problems at the conference that had to do with the facility.  The first was the air conditioning, as it was so effective that people were looking for coats.  The second was a public address system flaw in which we got to listen to the presentation that was going on next door for about three minutes.  Ultimately it was fixed.

The food at the conference was okay.  They had a nice variety of fruit, but the prepared items lacked the attention to detail that is possible.  Lunch was a cold cut, build your own sandwich bar, and there was plenty of food for everybody.  One of the cheeses provided looked a bit suspect, and so I  skipped that one, as it reminded me of sliced velveeta. They did serve a salad and it was, again, ok.  We did not eat in any of their restaurants and so there is no comment to make on them. 

The room was clean and that's always a good thing.  At check in I was made aware that I would be in a room with an unprecedented view of an adjoining wall, and that's what I had.  I had chosen 'quiet' when given the option, and this room did deliver that.  I'm writing this here for you, so that you, at check in, can be sure to ask about the view, especially if it's important to you.

Be sure and review the location of this place, as it does take some time to get to other places that you might want to go to.  You're away from the main action in Las Vegas.

When you compare this hotel to the big lavish places on the strip, obviously there is no comparison, but if you look at it for what it is, a neighborhood place providing a reasonable room rate, it's simply not too bad."}
{"text":"This is a great hotel, the rooms are clean and well maintained. The casino is unique in its own way and provides a very comfortable environment. They make it so you never have to leave the property with movies, bowling, and multiple bars. Id be happy staying here again"}
{"text":"Went to buffet for the frist time waiting in line 30mine had the taco they where good but I am feeling sick since I left the casino BBQ was dry my room mate not feeling good even he went work"}
{"text":"This location is becoming really run down. I've never really expected it to be good because of the neighborhood it's in. People in those areas do not take care of their things and do not treat public places like they should. But, I'm not really concerned with that. It is not my problem. What I am concerned with is howthe employees act. Now that I'm writing this, I remember having several bad interactions with employees in the past. I had one where a server who told me she was off duty, try to ask me for money. I thought she was just a guest and we were gambling together but after a little time, I noticed a lot of employees seemed to know her. I've never seen her before and I've been here a good amount of times. She finally told me she was a server but she had been asking me to give her money so she can play more with me. I was winning so it wasn't a big deal and I was having fun but thinking back, it seemed kind of shady and possibly planned. I've always had a really bad time with servers bringing drinks here. Every time I pass by the server pit by the bar, I see them just sitting there chatting with each other. I've given up on worrying about drinks even though I pour hundreds of dollars in every night I'm here. It seems pointless to try complaining about that. Most recently, I had an extremely strange thing happen. I put my card in and the little sidescreen pops out saying it recognized me. Suddenly, during a bonus, I looked down and saw someone else's name in the bottom bar. It was my card but somehow someone else's name was there, \"Karrin\". I thought this was extremely strange especially since this girl had just sat next to me and was talking about jackpots on the machine I was on. When I mentioned the card malfunction, she barely batted an eyelash and said that happens all the time. I've been going here for years and have never seen that happen. Upon retrospect, she seemed really really close with the slot rep there. When he came over to hear the problem about the malfunction, he just started punching the card reader. He didn't even check the card, he just punched it like he knew exactly what was wrong. He was trying to shake out the twisted reader. I mean, how come he didn't even check to see the card was the wrong one? That along with the girl who (strangely looked like a 'karrin' to me), both acted like this was totally normal. I'm not gonna lie, it was so strange that I thought maybe they were a jackpot team or something. I've never hit at a station casino so I wouldn't know but it was so strange there had to be something going on. The fact that part of the weirdness was an employee made me think it was going to be a surprise but almost two weeks now and nothing. 

Someone please tell me what that was about..."}
{"text":"I had a great time last night bowling with my daughter and son in law. Bowled at 179, 193, 211. Bowling is only $1 per game on Thursday nights. Bought 2 new bowling balls and a bag for my daughter and son in law. It helped their game. Very friendly and knowledgeable guy."}
{"text":"Greg Turco the hotel manager is a bad  manager he lets his employees basically steal and defends them over a customer I DO NOT recommend this place I have lived in vegas for a long time and have always heard stuff about this place but about a week or so ago my girlfriend and I stayed here and they kept my deposit because I had marijuana on the table that clearly was never smoked. from my understanding in the state of Nevada you are allowed to have marijuana legally I understand you can't smoke just anywhere so I rolled it  to go smoke at my cousins house when we went to check out I had the blunt rolled not smoked yet when they told me I smoked in the room I said no but I do have marijuana on me I showed them the blunt that was not sparked yet.  So if you are a marijuana smoker or have any illnesses for the reason that you need it I would not come here cause they charge you $100 for having something that is legal to have now.i hope this is useful to some people to not get your money taken and basically get called a liar.. very bad customer service"}

{"text":"My very spry 81 year old father and his girlfriend stayed at Texas Station to attend a wedding this past weekend, it was close to the venue so that's why he chose it.. He was EXTREMELY disappointed

1) Parking distance was not close and there was no valet service available to help with bags
2) Upon check-in it was required to leave credit card info. so they could charge an additional $15 per day to make up the bed even though the room was pre-paid 
3) Pool was teeny tiny, no room for adults... There were 6 kids in the water and no accommodation for any additional children/people
4) The food was lousy
5) The staff was mehhhh at best. 

Don't waste your time staying here."}
{"text":"Situated 5 minutes from my auntie's house, this \"local\" casino offers all the aspects of what you are looking for in a casino, without all the hustle & bustle of a large crowd...

This casino is off the strip 2 minutes up the 95 fwy.  I prefer this place as opposed to others since its more laid back, has decent table stakes, ranging from 5 to 100 dollars per bet, and the cocktail waitresses come by quite often...

In the long run, I'm 50-50 winning here, but thats certainly better than other places I tried to run my money up on...

They also have a good food plaza, video game center, movie theater, and bowling alley...

Take a trip sometime to Texas Station!..

Well, they never found \"Marry Merritt\" in their employee records (the woman on the invoice to contact for billing inquiries). Accounting didn't return our 3rd call. Yesterday I went to the bank to dispute the charge. My bank, not Texas, reimbursed me for their mistake. I hope they go after them hard!

Thank you, Jonelyn G for posting your experience in the reviews. It is because of you I took my claim to the bank instead of waiting for Texas Station to do nothing.

{"text":"Texas Station is an awful place to stay while in Las Vegas. Shell out the extra one hundred and stay at a more guest-oriented hotel that won't scam you out of money you could be using towards activities.

My family and I went on a trip to Vegas last weekend, and first and foremost, Check-In was a horror. My mom had paid in advance and booked an early check in (something that cost extra, she was charged for it). Upon getting to the front desk, we were told that we could not check in early because there were still guests in the room. We had to wait until regular check in time and still had to pay the fee for a luxury of \"early check in\" that we did not even receive. Not only that, but the clerk then proceeded to say that my mom's card had been declined, mind you, after she had already paid in full through booking. So short nearly two hundred dollars now, my sister had to pay for the room, deposit and all. More on the money scam later.

My uncle went as well and had also booked in advanced (a non smoking room). His room was not ready upon arrival, and in order to get him out of the way, the clerk stuck him in a random room in an effort to get rid of him and help the next person in line. She put him and his family in a smoking room. With chronic asthma, he could hardly breathe. After hauling his luggage and family back and forth from lobby to smoking room back to lobby, all the clerk said was \"All I can say is sorry.\"

Fast forward to nearly two hours later when the rooming (not the money) situation was sorted out, we find out that there is a limit on towels per room. It's three. Three towels per room, per day. I don't know if anyone knows how difficult it is to have four ladies in a room trying to shower, but three towels is not enough. Speaking of the shower, the bathtub was gross, stained, and the water pressure was bad.

On the day of check out, it was beyond frustrating trying to get downstairs. We waited fifteen minutes for an elevator, because the hotel thought it was a great idea to begin transporting mattresses during peak check out times. We ended up just traveling down four flights of stairs with luggage because it was impossible to get on the only two elevators in the hotel.

Let's talk about more money scams that Texas Station holds. My sister (whom if you don't remember from above, had to pay just about $200 to cover the money the hotel scammed from my mom's card) only received a little over half of the deposit she put in. We left the room in the same condition we found it, and there was no sort of mini bar or anything for extra spending. So where did the rest of the money go? Well, that's something my family has to deal with because of this awful hotel.

We travelled from California, expecting to have a decent place to stay, considering the three star rating. This was such a let down, and I'm disappointed that anybody is running a hotel like this. If you're planning a trip to Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and DO NOT stay at Texas Station."}
{"text":"This place is fun and you can make a little money if you know what your doing. I love the poker room but yesterday I hit the slots up. And it was less stressful than being inside a poker game plus I made a pocket full of change. For those of you who know just how cheap I am you guys know I'm in heaven. Also inside this location we ate at a steak house called Austin it is also five star worthy all by itself. I had chop salad and wine with a nice steak this little spot is really hot and if you take a date their you both will love it. I would not call this place family ready because when I hit a nice place like this the last thing I would like to hear is someone's yelling or crying child. But over all I love Texas Station and  will return as often as I can. I don't play blackjack but when I return I will give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to the sports book to place by bets and the line was very very long. But, I got through it in 8 minutes and made it \"just in time\" The sports book was very smokey and my clothes reaked. I wish there was a better ventalation system. 

I like the movie theater here. It is huge and plays later-night movies.

I also like the food court. Fat Burger and Dairy Queen are here."}
{"text":"I come to Texas a bit , but not too terribly much! But the way I was treated today when
I had a descripency was 100% professional and very well done.! A place that will be honest with you when you are playing is a great place to play, and they should be applauded as such...THANK YOU TEXAS, You have my business!"}

{"text":"Texas station along with their palace station its what Circus Circus used to be. You pay a resort fee which in itself is Criminal thats supposed to cover the Internet. Internet is spotty at best no matter how many times you call their Internet provider. The TV remote is outdated by 20 years and is complete nightmare to just look at the TV guide. They had me talk to Engineering (Jose B.) Who didnt have a clue what was on the TV remote. This is the quality of staff here. Management needs to step in quick because your guests aren't as stupid as you treat them. The manager was supposed to call me back over the issues hahahaha they dont give a Rats ass. Nice going Station Casinos. This is strike 3 for you guys."}
{"text":"As far as casinos go this one is pretty run of the mill. I do give it high marks for having a variety of stuff to do such as theater, pretty cool bowling alley, and a good variety of places to eat (restaurants, buffet, and fast food). I kind of wish that 3.5 was an option but since it isn't I will round down."}
{"text":"Eek I wasn't too happy with my second stop here. I asked for a bottle of water from one of the casino workers who walks around asking people if they wanted a drink. She said she could get the water but it would probably take a long time and I should just go walk over to the bar if I wanted it quicker. I walked over to the bar and the same casino worker was basically just standing there doing nothing but still couldn't get us the water :/. She told us we'd have to go to the other bar ....Really? You're standing there doing nothing and you can't reach over to get the bottled water to hand to us. Really?

All I wanted was some water...it took me having to ask 3 different casino workers and 2 bars later to get my water.  Yes, people all that for just water....."}

{"text":"I never had a problem with Texas Station, as a matter of fact I went there a lot. It's near my place and the movie theater is descent and cheap. I've ate at the buffet and liked it. The biggest problem I have is how they handle vandalism in their parking garages. My dad parked in their parking garage to play on the slots for a couple of hours and came out to his car to find all 4 of his tires slashed. When he went to security they asked him questions like he was the vandal. He was there for about 4 hours waiting to get a tow truck and when he asked security if they could hold the keys so the tow truck driver could pick them up, they refused. The worst part is, Texas Station says he is responsible for the damages. I think they just lost a local regular who plays slots at least twice a week. I will not go there anymore and neither will he or most people we know."}
{"text":"Three enthusiastic stars. Trust me on this. It's straight down the middle of the road, and if you keep your expectations in check, you're going to have a great stay.

This off-the-strip casino and hotel is more than just a bunch of slot machines and hotel rooms; they've got a few things going on that set it apart from lesser properties. Though a far cry (not so very far, but far enough) from the splash and panache of The Strip, there are a few fun additions for the traveler on the budget.

Case in point--a big ol' bowling alley downstairs. A stage in the casino area where a man and his band were belting out some serious rock country. A gift shop. Several restaurants. A food court. And of course, the movie theater. Many, many years ago I ate at Austin's Steakhouse (one of the food options in the casino) and had a tremendous meal. It looks like there haven't been many upgrades since then and the prices have dropped, but to be fair I haven't returned for a meal in years.

The hotel portion is perfectly acceptable. The rooms are comfortable, not giant, but modern enough. The television was a disappointment with less-than stellar control and scratchy reception, but if you're in Vegas and you're watching TV you just might be doing it wrong. The bed was a little rigid, but I slept in spite of it. Though the elaborate sign over the door promised an incredibly fancy \"Cardio Room,\" it actually held 4 machines (one of them broken), packed into a teeny space. I mean, that was just embarrassing. If you're interested in big group meetings or parties, they do cater, and they have a pretty sizable conference wing to the casino with big rooms for your shindig.

Note that when you're booking, you're likely to see some pretty cheap rates advertised. You have to add at least 10 bucks to that for tax, and you'll also add $14 to that for their nonsense \"Resort Fee.\" What is that \"Resort Fee,\" you ask? It's $14 you have to pay. You get to advertise a cheaper rate, then add a fee. It's a gimmick, it's ridiculous, it's stupid. Even with that added price, though, you're still getting a pretty cheap rate.

It's more than just a hotel. Not quite a full-fledged mega-casino. Keep those expectations in line and you'll have a terrific, budget-friendly stay."}
{"text":"We enjoy the breakfast buffet once a month.There is a fair amount of business and sometimes a wait to be seated but never a long wait. 
The selection is very good. The food is better than most buffets and fresher too.
 I particularly like the made to order eggs station. Omelets are delicious.VERY reasonably priced and if you are a rewards member, you often get a two for one buffet so two people can eat for $8. All you can eat. Not a bad deal at all for the quality of food."}
{"text":"They have a great buffet.  My Aunt used to live in Vegas and this is one of the \"locals\" casinos they always went to.    The place was always clean.   My mom and I did stay there once and the room was nice as well."}
{"text":"This review is for the buffet. Came here last night with the misses for dinner, for the money you can't beat the price. As a local I tend to go to more off the strip properties, the stations are good. Anyways Saturday is BBQ night :)!! 11.99 with my gold card. The brisket was amazing, the ribs were good, bbq chicken was excellent. They have a huge variety of food, the mashed potatoes were very tasty. The desert section was nice as well. I recommend the cheesecake. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because if you get a booth you will kill your back (I'm 5'11) it sits so low it's unbelievable, mine as well sit on the floor. I even saw a lady fall on her face getting out. The idiot who designed this booth must have been 12. NOTE: Get a table your back will thank me later! Last thing you want to do is worry about back spasms while your stuffing your face with brisket"}
{"text":"Myself and a group of friends went bowling here last night, and it was a great experience. The customer service was great, and the bowling itself was pretty cheap too. There was 6 of us and in total it was only about $23 so not too shabby compared to other bowling alleys. We came in around 2300 and the lights were off and metal music was playing. Obviously metal music isn't the usual music you'll hear in a bowling alley, but fortunately my friends and I listen to that branch of music so we had a good time. The bowling lane itself seemed a little shorter in comparison to other bowling alleys, but if anything that just made us feel like we were better bowlers lol. This place was definitely a lot better than Santa Fe bowling!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly service from all the staff. Our room didn't feel clean or welcoming. There weren't enough blankets on the bed--? Just a sheet. There was a dead spider squished to the wall."}
{"text":"Let me first say the casino is large and we enjoyed the oyster restaurant but that was about it.
1. Booked reservation for King size was told by front desk nope only had 2 queens. Well okay...
2. No newspaper, just no forget we said we give them out to our guesy was promptly directed to gift shop. Well okay...
3. Decide to take a afternoon nap...nope alarm was going off in a hall or a room called 0 no response got hold music, questioned self why i was still in building hung up...
4. I find a lost child bring to front desk,clueless clerk doesn't call room when child gives her the # just questions name on screen doesnt match childs.Easy fix call room?? No call security to ask what to do. So Security guard is thinking for 5 mins...he says well just call the room first... wow that was easy. 
5. 1155pm people next room over are really loud talkers or the walls are thin. Thanks buddy enjoyed his conversation about bathroom problems. Romantic...
6. Rooms a/c unit sounds like it's struggling for air then dies 2am...
7. Beds were very uncomfortable hard on sides bouncy in the middle weird...
8. Oh and when checking in there is a $100 deposit that was a nice surprise....
  Romantic night ruined Never again?"}
{"text":"Texas Station is a kind of a hit or miss casino you can't expect a lot it's a bit old, it's a little boring but at the same time it's got good deals on room rates, it's got Station's name under it to boot etc.... I will say this much I lost $200-300 in this place in 1 hour and got myself comp'd 3 rooms ever since and over 500 tier points.. so they def consider this a bit on the higher side of rolling the dice and pulling the slots.. If your in the area travel a bit farther down to Sante Fe Station or if your in the mood to just take a shot at some action at the Texas Station then go for it maybe you'll hit big I know they offer room easy if you give them some play."}
{"text":"This casino is right by my house and I love coming here. Staff is always friendly and there is so plenty you can do from catching movie and dinner to getting some games of bowling in. Never had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Affordable. Friendy and Fun!
The rooms are clean and well appointed. Check in was easy and fast.
 The pool was lovely in the early afternoon before it gets hot out there.
Plenty of food options and great steak house and Oyster Bar.

The Casino is clean and hoppin'
Friendy atmosphere. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!"}
{"text":"Remember when you could get a cheap room and cheap food in Las Vegas? You still can as long as you go away from the strip and downtown and head to one of the casino complex in the outskirt! This is just what Texas Station is, old style, good value place.

Nothing fancy but my room was clean, parking was easy and there's a good choice of restaurant and a Starbucks on site. I also used the small pool on my last day here (weather was a bit too cold on first few days of my early April stay)."}
{"text":"what surprised me the most was the $100 deposit I had to pay even after paying the entire bill up front!!!!! I asked what was the reason for this and the front desk person said was \"oh everyone has to pay the deposit\" My room was supposed to be smoke free, but there was a definite remainder of cigarette smoke in the room. The bathroom was so dim, I thought there was a blown light bulb. And last but not least the most annoying thing was the $50 cab ride from the airport. They have no airport shuttle."}
{"text":"There's not a lot to love here, but I've got some serious like for this place.

First of all, I dig the location.  When I go to Las Vegas I want to stay far away from the Strip.  Usually I stay over on Boulder Highway, but every once in a while I like to hit up North Las Vegas.

I have stayed here many times in the past, so I knew what to expect.  Stations properties are fairly standard.  Same basic rooms, few amenities.  I'm cool with that.

This visit I booked my room through Hotels.com.  I booked and paid for a room with a King sized bed.  So, I show up right at the appointed check-in time and they have no rooms with a King sized bed.  I offered to wait and check in later.  The clerk hemmed and hawed and I realized she wasn't going to give up a King bed, so I accepted a room with two double beds.  I got the distinct impression all this was because I booked through Hotels.com instead of directly through the hotel reservation system.

This has happened to me before.  I always respond the exact same way: I refuse to spend another dime in the place.  I will not gamble, nor will I eat in any of their restaurants.  Why should I?  I chose to spend my dough at places that appreciate me as a customer.  

So, even though the room came with a lot of great coupons (like a $5 match play, free Keno ticket, Bingo bonus cards, etc), I didn't bother with them.  No way were these weasels getting any of my cash.

About the actual room: the WiFi was free.  The TV was decent sized and the channel selection was above average for a budget property (had a Keno channel, but no horse racing).  There are no ports for charging anything, but there is an outlet near the bed to plug a charger into.  

The bed was saggy, but not too excessively.  The pillows were the worst thing in the room (other than the absence of a King bed).  Cheap ass super fat foam pillows, perfect to sit on at a football game, but impossible to use for sleep.  I rang up Housekeeping and had them bring me a replacement.  It was just a slightly less thick version of the same cheap ass foam pillow.  If you are contemplating a stay here, I suggest you plan on bringing your own pillow.

The amenities are paltry, but at least they still have soap in bar form.  I hate liquid soap places!

Finally, let me say the room was clean.  Housekeeping here is excellent.  I love that they provide a little envelope to leave a tip for the housekeeper.  

Mikey C says: honor my reservation or lose my business."}
{"text":"Off the strip, really nothing to do around it and about 20mins off the strip. Down stairs in the casino floor there are a couple places to eat, tables, slots, bars, a betting hall and a couple areas that had live bands also had a movie theatre and bowling alley. For the most part everything in the hotel is out dated, uncomfortable bed, and not so great shower pressure. Room service is hit and miss on the time seems like they are working 24/7. Also walls are just about paperthin it seems heard a nice fight outside our hotel room last night. Guess the price was decent. Seems to be a little more of the ghetto folks here"}
{"text":"Do not eat at the buffet. The food sits under the lights and gets hard. The Chinese station is the worst. The woman that makes the food, does not make the food like she was trained. I complained about the food to her. she acted as if she didn't understand me. I asked for a manager and she told me no,turned around and processed to place old cold food onto the new food she was trying to cook(since I was complaining) . The mashed potatoes were runny. it's cheap food. LoLo's is a lot better. They have more hospitality."}
{"text":"Austins, Bowling and Movies are all I would go here for.

This is a station casinos property and they all are pretty similar to me. they all smell like smoke. You walk in to the place and it reaks of smoke, and when you leave it stays and lingers on your clothes. 

They have cosmic bowling and great deals if you like to bowl.  You can have birthday parties as well and its inexpensive.  They have a snack shop that serves wings, pizza and hot dogs, and ofcourse soda. My favorite is Shirley Temple. You go over and buy your soda by the pitcher at the snack shop and head over to the bar and get the cherry syrup and cherries.

Going to the movies here is almost like watching movies in the ghetto. They check your bags and treat everyone like hoodlums.. If you are a big bag kinda girl, they will check and make sure you are not smuggling anything in as far as food goes. They want you to spend your money inside thats why. This is the only station casinos theater i know about that checks your bag physically. Geez!

Austin's Steakhouse is similar to Charcoal room at Santa Fe. My favorite , although very simple, is the bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp.. oh so good..

I like coming here to spend time with my mom playing bingo.. overall this place is kid friendly, and family friendly. Oh and they have a Kidsquest for those who have little ones! Just make sure you bring shot records if you're a first time dropping kids off to Kidquest!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this casino semi-frequently for the past 4 years and here is what I've drawn from my experiences here:

- the slots are notoriously tight...they practically squeek and scream as the reels spin...beware..
- the movie theater is a Regal Cinema(which I like due to their frequent user card program)
- the sports book seems to be the typical set up for a Stations casino...solid, if not spectacular
- last time I was here I won a free buffet during a promotion(review to follow :P) 
- can get a bit smoky but not as bad as some of the other locals spots I've been to
- the casino in general is pretty clean, much better than the Fiesta across the street
- the service by the employees is strictly a crap shoot, ranging from nice to downright surley and bitter

Nowadays, its a place I might catch a movie if the time works best for me that given day. So 3 stars is about right. Not the best, not the worst...just somewhere right in the middle."}
{"text":"I just recently relocated to Vegas and found Texas Station to be close to home. I have stopped by a few times and played video poker at the bar. Marty is the best bartender ever! He knows all the locals that come in by name and knowing I am new to the area, he has introduced me to others. It is nice to feel welcome in a new city!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at the buffet 11 people was very unhappy with the hostesses we was celebrating a birthday after spending over 200$ which we had 5 on one check 6 on another wanted to sit next to each other it was not busy two tables next to each other was fine but because we didn't want to pay a automatic gratuity the hostess made it her point to seat us on opposite sides of a empty room. We are all in the casino industry cocktail server, a dealer and a Director in our party. We paid the automatic gratuity and she then said oh you can go sit next to your family. I then asked for them to put the tables together to accommodate us. We will never return because she was so busy hustling for the server. I would've tip well over the automatic gratuity.."}
{"text":"It's one of the older casinos so there's stuff outdated and what not. The food court is continuously taking and putting new food in the food court. The movies are cheap, and theaters are okay, I just wish they did a better job with not letting minors sneak into rated R movies. I went and saw IT tonight and there were like 8 year olds in there who made it quite hard to watch the movie."}
{"text":"This station casino does not care for its neighbors or community.  They book parking lot events that play music loud enough to shake my front door and hear in a well enclosed Walmart.  Called the property and they sent me to security -- they said there was nothing I could do because it was private property... he didn't even care to listen to my recommendation of putting noise restrictions in future contracts.  Called the police 311 and they said the complaint was already created, the police dispatched, and they said they would be done at 7pm (and they were going to do nothing)."}
{"text":"Casino only review I liked it it's huge ! My sister lost her ID and they called her so fast to security because they found  it ! I lost that night but thank you stranger for finding it ! It's a nice and clean and attentive casino"}
{"text":"Living close by to this Casino, and coming by after work to gamble, I find this place to be interesting. 

Staying with the Texas theme, the outside looks amazing, and very well kept in shape. I would probably say, if it was located in a nicer place, it probably would be better in many ways. But the fact that its located on Rancho and not a good place  for that matter, it has its wear and tear that really shows. 

Most of the time, I go their with the wife to see a movie. The theater itself is located next to the food court, which is nice. But once inside, their concession stand seem to be a small area and not very well put. They do have a concession stand upstairs, but rarely open. I like the fact that the casino has two different levels, where they have more theaters. But it probably can be cleaner. 

Restaurants, Food courts, and Starbucks, of course, I have mix reviews on that. Starbucks, there are a few Batista's there that I like. But one of them didn't really get my order right. Even though I did drink it, cause I needed coffee in my system, it sure didn't go well with my stomach. I'm lactose intolerant, so I ordered soy milk with no whip. Its kind of pointless to ask for soy milk, when you put on the whip. Now whenever I pass by that Starbucks, I make sure its not with that one Batista, who puts whip with soy milk. Feast Buffet, I had a review on lack of cleanliness and lack of service. But the food and dessert was great. The food court, I don't like the fact that some of these places don't open till 11am. But their choice in restaurants is decent.  The only place open 24 hours is Fat Burger, which, I don't think its that great. Customer service is nice, but food is kind of lousy. 

I like the fact that they have a bowling center which was nice to bowl here and there. Its been a while, so I really enjoyed bowling. Its a nice place, but probably could be better. But the fact that they have a bowling center is good enough for me. 

The Convention Center, I went there for my wife's Christmas party, The place look really nice, and very roomy. Very clean, and really like the professionalism of the staff.   If I ever had a big gathering, I probably would have it here. 

As far as gambling goes, I would say I'm probably one of their regulars, so they know me very well. But I would have to say, from the first time I step foot in the gambling area, people were nice, and the waitress were nice. They at least talk, and know what their doing, most of the time. The waitress tend to make sure we're okay on drinks. 

Over all, its a decent place to be at. It has its ups and downs. I wouldn't expect much out of it, but just enough to be satisfied on being there."}
{"text":"We used to stay at Texas Station all the time when we came to town, but we haven't so in a while.  The hotel is fairly nice, the gift shop is nice, but we decided to stay at Sam's Town once, and we were sold after that.  I like to play blackjack and there aren't that many active tables sometimes.  My husband likes to play video poker and there weren't many machines that he liked either, but we went this month, and enjoyed our visit more.  Perhaps we'll go next time we're in town.  They have a movie theater (which we've never been to) and restaurants, etc.  It's a good place that locals frequent.  We used to also visit the buffet but the line is always pretty long now when we go."}
{"text":"So the hotel & casino are nice. Don't expect to be able to get much reception to your cell phone in here though, if you have ATT or Sprint. 

The hotel room was pretty roomy, but I was really disappointed by the fact that there was no comforter/bigger blanket on the beds. It was just a sheet, thin blanket and top sheet. The bed wasn't bad though, I slept alright no aches or pains to complain about. The television is extremely outdated, but we didn't watch it anyway. 

I think the waitresses in the hotel could have better/sexier uniforms. Personally, they were more of an eye sore than a person I wanted to purchase a drink from. 

The resort fee that you have to pay after you check out is pretty ridiculous to me. Why should you have to pay for things they advertise as \"complementary\"? 

My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights for a wedding. The reception area was beautiful and the catering was amazing. That was the best part of our stay.

The bowling alley downstairs is pretty cool and fairly priced. Although, the snack bar is a little pricey and when my boyfriend went to order a soft pretzel, the guy told him it was a 5 minute wait. Instead, we waited 20 minutes for a burnt pretzel. 

As far as food goes, the Grand Cafe has great food but we realized that we could have eaten at the buffet for a lot cheaper. There was a pamphlet advertising Room Service but another guest that stayed the same time as us were told that they don't deliver the food to the rooms. So much for ROOM service, hah.

Next time I visit Vegas, I will be staying somewhere else. 


P.S. If you plan on having a wedding reception here, they charge you a ridiculous amount for champagne. If you bring your own champagne, there is a $9 fee per bottle opened."}
{"text":"Good lord, I thought this was a hotel, not a white trash penal colony.  Well, ok, in all fairness, it is not just a white trash penal colony, because it is full of trash of all races, creeds, and colors.  

But, in complete honesty, if the human race had a trash can, it would be this dump.  

I am, right now, in a \"non smoking\" room, that smells like the rugs were shampooed with chewing tobacco.   Or, maybe I just smell it from the next room, because the walls are so thin that you can hear a dog fart through them.  

Walking through the lobby, it looks like a frigging zombie movie.  That movie \"Leaving Las Vegas\" should have been filmed here, because being here makes ME want to drink myself to death with a hooker.  

There are two reasons to stay here:  1)  There is a blizzard coming, it is unsafe to be outside, and you are on foot, with no shoes, and you'll die before you get to other shelter, 2) you're trash and you want to be with the other trash.  

Holy crap.  Get me out of this frigging dump."}
{"text":"Texas Station!! Yeeehaaa! Or Nah.. So I was literally dragged to come down to this place last night. Most definitely not my kind of scene however my friend had some FREE PLAY and food comps that they insisted on sharing with me. We all love free stuff right? Well what's that rule about you get what you pay for? I'm the first to admit I am extremely spoiled when it comes to being an MLIFE member (Platinum). I DO NOT gamble anywhere else besides my lovely MGM properties (Some of them). 

This place is great for locals who live in the area and or just don't like to play down on the strip with the big dogs! Whoot Whoot! Is this casino a classic? Sure... Depends on what you classify as classic because it's for sure not classy. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy but they have security..I think.. Anyways it is a bit dated inside and when we were playing I just noticed that the employee's all seemed to hate their jobs. That slogan that they run about \"We Love Locals\" seems a bit contradicting. As we played a few games of blackjack at different tables, there was just no sense of personality from the dealers. Weird. I decided to get up and go play some slots! Boy are they TIGHT! I thought the WYNN was bad ha-ha! There were plenty of Cocktail waitress's working. They seemed to be a lot more friendly and pleasant to deal with. I only ended up ordering one drink since the premium liquor I'm used to wasn't offered. The vodka that they used in my Vodka tonic was awful might've been rubbing alcohol? My throat get's itchy from cheap liquor.. Don't expect anything that normally comes in a fancy glass to come as normal here. You get a tiny probably 6-8oz glass full with ice and about 3 ounces of liquor. Okay this was my que to go! My friend starting wining so of course we stayed a bit longer. Try the 99 cent Margaritas they offer. Not much alcohol but you can pretend there is plenty mixed in or just grab your flask from the car and add in your own Vodka like I did :-) All in all not sure if I'd be back."}

{"text":"Checked in here a few times - guess it's time for a review.

It's a Station Casino property. As it's not the Red Rock, you can pretty much know that it's more geared for the locals. 

The casino never seems to be busy like the strip properties which is nice as I don't like walking around like a herd of cattle. That translates to ample parking considering they have a few parking structures. There's the usual bars, clubs and places to eat - including a food court but what's also nice is that there's a theater there. There may be other amenities but I'm usually here to eat."}

{"text":"Did I really rate this place 2 stars?  Barely.

First, the good...I'm a local and place a lot of sports bets here.  Better odd's can be found in sportbooks off the strip, but this place is close to home for me.  For those on the \"cheap\", they have $1 dogs and $1 Buds during any NFL game.  $1 margarita's can be had at any hour.  I also see most of my movies at the Regal here...they have 18 clean theaters.  Fatburger is open 24 hours.  Lobster at the Oyster Bar is good.  Bowling is a bargain.  Like most Station haunts, there are various \"Swipe & Win\" events throughout the year.

The bad...the southern parking lot and surrounding hotel rooms on the property stink!  There's been a sewage clog at the intersection of Rancho Drive & Coran Lane since at least 2009.  I find their food court better than any restaurant.  There you'll find a Fatburger, Baja Fresh, Sbarro, and Panda Express.  The Feast Buffet sucks, unless you like salty food.  I only eat there when I've won a free buffet & I know what's edible from trial and error.  Pasta Cucina & Austin's Steakhouse will disappoint (if you're craving steak, Ron's at AZ Charlie's is worth the short drive).  The Grand Café is marginal at best and on a downward slide (still good for breakfast though).  The staff throughout is hit & miss.  Most hate their jobs, especially the cocktail servers.  Most of the dealer's are Asian with no personality...but, a couple are quite friendly and easy to find (hint:  You won't find them at the craps table).  Slots are tight.  Overall, this place is a giant step down from the likes of Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch and Aliante.

*Update Dec 2014

Still 2 stars at BEST!

Bud bottles during NFL football games have increased from $1 to $2 ea...still not a bad deal, but the servers here are some of the worst in Vegas.  Hot dogs are still $1, but they put out a lot less condiments now.  Grumpy Marty (from the satirical \"We Love Locals\" commercials) no longer works the sportsbook bar and is not missed in the least.  I've sat at machines at least at least 100 times here and can count on one hand how many times a cocktail server has offered me a drink (no joke).  Sbarro has been replaced with a single slice pizza joint."}
{"text":"We had a king room and it was on the older side but comfortable and clean (older decor rooms are not unusual in Vegas especially hotels offering low room rates) This hotel/casino is considered to be a \"locals\" place. It is not in a very good section of North Las Vegas and is not near the strip (about a 20/30 minute car ride). The casino is big and has a pleasant feel.  I felt they had a great mix of games. Unfortunately the employees that we encountered throughout this property (in under 24 hours)were not happy employees.  They don't want to be there and are very unhappy with bad attitudes. For instance;
- we stopped at one of the casino floor bars and the bartender was so miserable and  it was so evident he was angry. I was taken back and really just wanted to move on but we ordered drinks and he slammed them in front of us and loudly complained about the  things bothering him especially the TV that wasn't working. We left and went to another casino bar and found another miserable bartender.They both did their job but they were clearly miserable employees but that seems to be the theme here all except the lady who checked us in but she too could not smile. - Went to the cafe and waited 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us and was ready to leave until a lady said she couldn't take us waiting another minute and took our order. (I believe she was the beverage server). 
-No cocktail service by the food court casino area. People were annoyed. Finally one comes by but you had to see her and flag her down because she wasn't stopping.  She  took our order and we waited over 20 more minutes for her to get back.
- One slot machine was beeping for so long and loud needing paper that we could not take the noise anymore so we left the area twice.  This happened 3 times and the third time one lazy slow miserable sad faced slot attendant asked 'US' which machine it was making the noise LOL!!
- We did not have a do not disturb sign for our room so we asked the cleaning lady. She said it's behind the door, we said no its not there so she angrily gave us one.
-Checkout is at 12PM and we had someone pounding on our door at 11:45.

  I can only imagine the poor service you will get during the week because this was on a Saturday (and it wasn't crowded, gee I wonder why).  So sad because I really liked the casino. Low employee moral is a sign of poor management and/or company troubles to come. Too much competition wanting my business.... I will never return."}
{"text":"I just moved to Vegas and this was where my fiancée and I decided our first dining experience should be. Me being from Texas, I was awestruck at the lights of the casino and the amount of games available. We purchased a member card, which gave us a discount on the buffet. It was a good selection of food, although the taste was just ok. I will be back though for the games and the bowling. Our waitress was pleasant and very attentive."}
{"text":"Definitely not a 3-star hotel. Barely a 2-star hotel based on my other multiple experiences staying in Vegas... Quite disappointed at the room cleanliness, quality of furniture, location. Everything looks old and depressing."}
{"text":"they have the best buffet in town... i just dont get why i would pay $30 to go into another buffet when i have texas! :D"}
{"text":"This review does not include the hotel, because I've never stayed there.
Regarding locals' casinos, Texas Station is right in the middle (hence 3 stars). 
It's huge. I went in through the north side, and when I headed south, I just kept walking and walking. If you want to inject exercise into your gambling then this the casino to do it.
Heading from the north to south, there's a food court, restrooms (very clean), and movie theaters. There are 5 or 6 bars throughout the casino, and I've never seen them very crowded. 
They have a steakhouse and oyster bar on the left (I'll write reviews for them in a couple of days). 
They have a pretty big sports book.
There's also a stage, which has small bands playing on the weekends.
There buffet is so-so. 
They also have a bingo room.
When you reach the south side of the casino, there's the gift shop. 
By the way, the slots are on the north and south ends, and the table games are in the middle, in case you feel like gambling. 
But, the casino is more smoky than average. It's probably because the carpet and ventilation system are old. 
There aren't enough cocktail servers, so it takes a long time for them to get around to you.
That's about it. Hopefully you won't get lost."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to go eat at the buffet...but I really had a very uncomfortable situation with one of the people that go up to you ask if you want for drinks when playing the slots. I was enjoying time with my family for almost 4 hours of playing. My family member ask for a bottle water from those ladies that come up to you. So I went and ask for a bottle of water. This what she said very rude manner \" where are you sitting are you playing if not I won't give any water\". I thought she was playing with me, since she seen my family playing. But no she didn't give a damn I was really surprise. This young lady works by the Buffet area she's small and very curvy and caucasian in the casino slots. Very disrespectful person, didn't get her name but I was there between 2 to 3 pm on January 5 2016..hope you don't get her attitude. 
That's my rating hope a manager can see this never I will recomendamos anyone to this place sorry but really bad service..big loss."}
{"text":"There's not really much I can say about Texas Station and have it cover everything and/or be 100% accurate. It is a very off-the-strip casino. 
What I can really speak for is more or less the hotel experience, what I have witnessed in the casino area and the food.  

My boyfriend and I have been in Texas Station Gambling Hall staying in their hotel for about a week, going on a week and a half. Overall, the atmosphere is \"okay\". Nothing in Texas Station really stands out, though if you do love the 'gambling-night-scene' you won't be let down.

The food here is really so-so. I'm going to have separate reviews for the places I have actually visited and eaten at, but it is all a little overpriced. If you want real food, visit the food court which has Fatburger (open 24/7), Baja Fresh, Sbarro, and Panda Express - otherwise, you have The Grand Café, Feast Buffet, Pasta Cucina and Austin's Steakhouse; this is not including the tiny, and horribly run, diner on the lower level of the casino where the Bowling area is. Oh, and they also have a Starbucks!

The people here are also so-so. There are ladies walking around in red velvet dresses that seem so droll I almost want to give them money to take a taxi home - that or give them an application they can fill out to get them a new job that they love. They basically wander around aimlessly, looking bored, annoyed and just unfriendly. I have yet to see one that looks at me in a kind manner! I'm assuming they are walking around to take bar orders for people like myself and tidy up the machines? Either way, they don't set the mood in the place at all.

The hotel portion of Texas Station ... actually isn't bad at all. Skimming through other reviews, a few people mentioned \"eh\" hotel rooms. Our room was actually quite nice! At the price it is per day, it's not bad at all. The only drawback is that you have to pay for your wifi PER DEVICE, which is $6 a device each day, and on top of that, if you need a fridge they will provide you one but it is $10 a day. 
Here, it seems the rooms tend to come with two beds - ours were full sized and very plush. They were definitely great beds to sleep in, super comfortable. Every room has its own AC Unit that is adjustable by the thermostat on the wall. You have to put your bedroom key card in the wall where it is illuminated by green LEDs for the AC to actually stay on.

The room service is good, but seriously annoying. DO NOT plan on sleeping in unless you have your 'do not disturb' sign on your door. They will generally come to your room around 9am-ish and they do this strange, silently knock two times and then enter routine while saying \"Hellloooo?\". Ugh.
They tidy up very well, though, I will give them that. Also the TVs in the rooms are flippin' awesome. We got a 25-30\" flat screen in ours with decent quality picture. 

Over all, not a whole lot of complaints. $1 mediocre margaritas, conference rooms and party rooms as well as a wedding chapel area, a nice movie theater, plenty of good places to eat, $3 blackjack,  tons of slot machines scattered everywhere, a lovely and quaint gift shop, Texas Station rewards (get it!), clean hotel rooms. Worth three stars. A-Okay it is!"}
{"text":"Rating for buffet only:

Cheap buffet with the member card, but the food itself is nothing impressive. Lots of variety and options, including everything from gumbo and jambalaya to panda-express style stir fry to tacos al pastor cooked to order to pizza and BBQ. Meat is usually dry (unless cut on the spot), and most dishes are on the bland side. I would recommend the fish, mashed potatoes, broccoli calzone, and biscuits and gravy. 

Many items were cold initially, but I later noticed they had warmed up. I'm not sure why, but it might be worth asking staff (who is polite and readily available) to warm something up. 

The casino/playing floor itself is distinctly thick with the smell of smoke, but the buffet area doesn't smell at all. Besides the smoke, there is no suggestive or pornographic advertising inside or out, which makes it relatively family friendly."}
{"text":"My fiance & I stopped in here to check on rates for people coming to our wedding from out of state. Trish, the lady at the front desk, was very nice & suggested we talk to the group rates folks. Regina, the sales coordinator, put us together with Li'Shey, the sales director. She asked the right questions, made suggestions for things that we hadn't thought of & even took the time to show us a room. We ended up doing a contraxt for a block of rooms for great prices at 2 locations so our guests will have a choice. She has a wall of recognition from all sorts of people, the Thunderbirds & a Women of Distinction award; very impressive! Both ladies were so friendly & helpful! 

The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the location & decor. They can't do anything about the location, but a renovation sometime in the not too distant future wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"Non smoking rooms still smell of smoke. Water shut off for an entire day. Furniture is outdated. Buffet food could have been better."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the buffet because he had good memories of one other time he tried the buffet YEARS ago with his family.

Well, on our current trip I must say that this place sucked so bad that I don't know where to start.  I know, I'll start with the unhealthy, thick, life-stealing smoke in the casino that you have to walk through on your way to the buffet.  

Oh, and then there are the depressing living dead looking people that you have to pass by who are wasting their time and money on the slot machines.  I mean, these people look SAD!!

And my prize for taking the long walk through the joyless smokey haze?  Bland, uninspired, cheap quality, worst buffet food I have ever had.  This crap was so colorless and pathetic that I found it hard to believe that my husband could have ever eaten decent food here before.  What a waste of money and, more importantly, minutes from my life.  I get the heebie-jeebies just remembering it.  Talk about a bad dream that I never want to have again!"}
{"text":"Pleasant room, quiet inside, noisy in hall.  They had no record of my prepaid reservation.  Fortunately I brought a printed copy and I had to wait 15 minutes for them to recreate the reservation.  I asked for upgrade room or casino dollars as compensation for their error - got nothing.  Casino perks with players card are miniscule - I got $3 free slot play.  I had the breakfast buffet for $5.99 which was good.  There is no free internet \"at all\" - though expedia had shown free internet \"limited\".  There are two levels $5.99 or $12.99 a day.  Low room fee but everything is upcharge, upsell.  You have to sign an agreement and initial a dozen section with different rules.  Would not stay at again.  Waiting to be sure I get my deposit back and don't get charged twice for room.  NOTE:  $14.95 resort fee per day in addition to room charge."}
{"text":"Machines are so tight, the only way to leave there with money is to rob them. I will not go back. I am local, and this is the only place that you have a 99% chance of loosing."}
{"text":"I was not expect too much about Texas station since I booked it cheap but come on!!! At least be friendly and smile. We drive a long distance and we are tired too.
The front desk, black lady, she yawn more than 6 times in front of my face and the breath is not smell good either.
At check in, I have to pay $100 for deposit, WTF, if I know the hotel have deposit, no way I come. I feel secured when I cash in my pocket. The check in lady did not bother explain the rules and just gave it to me to read it. WOW worst customer service ever.
The food was fair and cheap, parking is good since at 1AM in morning and it is only 24 car around.
At morning, When I ask to extend 1 more day, they charge me for $60 total which I only pay half price include tax and hotel fee last night. With $60, I can go to strip and rent better hotel and better service.
addition, It was so cold in room even I turn the heat to 83 and when I call for the front desk ask for more blanket., Never see the blanket or anyone call back
conclusion, worst hotel ever in Vegas. I think Motel 6 is much better. I certain that I will never come back. I regret to spent time in that hotel and waste my value time in Vegas"}

{"text":"Once upon a time I enjoyed coming to this place to watch movies, hang with friends at the lounge watching Love Shack perform, and enjoying a drink or two at the casino bars.  That was when Seinfeld & Friends were dominating the ratings on TV.  

I recently visited the property and it's lost it's fun atmosphere and energy.  The crowd has changed a lot since those glory days and the casino is just depressingly empty.  It didn't make me want to stay and hangout....at least I have some great memories from the good times.  Maybe it will get better when the economy rebounds?

Return Factor - 5%"}
{"text":"texas station's customer service has been nothing short of a nightmare. I honestly wish that I could cancel my reservation on the spot and take my fund elsewhere. For starters, the system for reservations is absurd. I've been traveling alone since my teenage years, even worked for a hotel or two & NEVER have I EVER known a policy that requires THREE deposits to modify an existing reservation. Initially, I called in reference to modifying a reservation & and even though it made ZERO sense to me, I obliged. I then experienced an unfortunate & untimely passing of my relative, which required me to adjust my check in date, as my flight will have me arriving in town after the 2nd (flight arrives at 12:35am) ..... I called to have my reservation adjusted and was flat out DENIED (even though I called well over 24 hrs in advance) and have been given the runaround and HORRIBLE customer service since Sunday evening. I've left messages for multiple managers at the front desk, only to NOT have ANY of my messages returned. I have dealt with extremely rude people placing me on extended hold times, only to be forwarded to a voicemail & be forced to \"wait\" for someone to call me back. I was told last night, after calling and trying to have the matter handled all day, that management was supposed to be in touch, and today after the funeral, I called & was told at 12:30 that after someone was off their phone call, I would be called. It is now 6pm central, still no follow up contact nor, was an email of any kind sent. 

This is not only a disgusting display of a lack of compassion & empathy for your \"guests\" but this is a clear slap in the face to someone who did NOT have to book with you, as well as the wedding block that is utilizing the facilities. I will absolutely NEVER come back and I haven't even checked in yet. I will be taking this review to all the hotel sites that I see your establishment on."}
{"text":"Rude service! Why would a bartender be rude when they live for tip money? I asked the bartender for a specific beer and he said \"NO!\" I asked \"please?\" He said no again. After a minute he finally told me they didn't have the beer brand that I ordered. He could have just said that in the first place! Talk about being absolutely rude!"}
{"text":"Along with the Fiesta Rancho located directly across the street, this is the closest locals casino in my neck of the woods in the badlands of the greater Las Vegas metropolitan area located near and beyond the North Las Vegas Airport.

Since opening in 1995, this casino has always had a real nice 24-hour poker room where the action never really stopped, but it sadly closed in 2014. All good things must come to an end.

There have been several sequential additions to the much smaller original Texas Station over the years. A large self-serve food court and a multiscreen cinema are now available as are the obligatory coffee shop and a very large buffet with a nearly endless variety of delectable edibles and deserts that change on a daily basis. 

Austin's Steakhouse is worth a visit for more upscale dining as is the Oyster Bar for seafood lovers (discount coupons for both are frequently available).

Various casino promotions/contests run throughout the year with the majority - but not all - related to slot or poker machine play.

If you should find yourself here, don't forget to cross Lake Mead Boulevard and check out the Fiesta Casino, the sister property next door. This casino's smaller overall footprint makes for a more homey atmosphere overall and is preferred by quite a few locals."}
{"text":"Woke up this morning refreshed. The beds here are very comfortable. Our room is clean and smells fresh. We are on the 5th floor and have a strip view, which is nice. Know what you are paying for when you choose this hotel.

It's not a 500.00 dollar per night room. Don't expect the Aria or Wynn. But for the price it's a great deal. Clean rooms, good play selection in the casino and very delicious food. You're not going to be disappointed as long as you're expecting a mid range room.

The station casinos get a bad rep, but I think they get a bad rep because people are expecting a 500.00 dollar room for 75-80 dollars.

I recommend this hotel"}
{"text":"This review is for their Oyster Bar which is one of the best, to me, in the city.
Very good and the staff is always helpful.. Im def going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars would. Absolute garbage hotel. Incompetent staff, lies and mistakes, and the whole place reeked of something."}
{"text":"This is another stations gem. This company has clean casinos with a lot of food court options, restaurant options and great drink specials. The stations love locals!"}
{"text":"Just here for a boxing match for my company cerveza tecate. The room was nice. Bed was comfortable, could see all of the las Vegas strip from my 6th story room window. This place has a bowling alley and its own movie theaters. Was only here for 19 hrs but had fun."}
{"text":"*** This review is for the casino only ***

It has been more than 10 years since I've been here and it looked the same last night as it did 10 years ago.

The casino was not smoky which was a pleasant surprise.  The garage on the north side made access to the restaurant easy."}
{"text":"We came here from wa state, first off there was gum under all our night stands, we found blood on the window seal, dirty floors, front desk service was rude! The halls smell horrible! The cocktail waitresses are vary rude here as well! We will never be coming back here again! Nasty nasty!!"}
{"text":"the two people at the bowling lanes snack bar really need help. They are working their butts off trying to keep up with this long line. Why would management schedule only two people to work on a Saturday night?"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite casino in Vegas because they offer everything I love.  Note I am trying to eat a lot more healthy now.  But not long ago I used to love to go here and eat at there buffet and food court.  Buffet is great and huge with all the stations you want (bbq, Chinese, salad bar, Mexican etc.) and everything was fresh and tasty.  Food court is A+ with Fatburger, Sabros, Baja Fresh, DQ and Panda Express.  They have good restaurants, bars and a night club that looks like its hopping on the weekends.  There is no other theater around so they show, basically, every movie that is playing in Vegas.  I have seen way more movies there than any place else and i cant say I have ever had a bad time (other than seeing some crap movies).  And if you are eating right I recommend the fish taco's at Baja Fresh!"}
{"text":"So very disappointed with this casino. I love coming and playing here, I love that they have a kids quest because I sometimes take my son when we come into town. Me and the fiancée have stayed here before and its our favorite off the strip casino. So we decided to stay here again!.... but OH MY GOSH!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE. My fiancées grandmother booked us the room, since she had a few comps and discounts available. She reserved us 2 rooms for this trip, one under her name and one under his, IN CASE something went wrong with either one. 

First off, there's only one person behind the front desk. ONE!!! its Thursday night, I'm sure there's enough people checking in and calling for there to be at least 2 ppl working, but nope! only one. so we waited and waited while she answered calls back to back and TRIED checking ppl in. Seemed like there was an issue with another family not being able to check in to there 3 rooms and they were waiting on management. 

Then we walk up, we give her our info, then she says she cant find anything! As were trying to find out whats going on, she starts talking to the other family about there issue! talk about rude!! then she just simply says \"there's nothing here for you\"  my fiancée is trying to explain to her, that this room was booked way in advance under his and his Grandmothers name, again she says \"I have nothing here for you\" with this plain stupid look on her face, with no sense of talking to use, trynna figure out what went wrong. Then, she calls mngmt to talk to them about the other family. As shes going back and forth with 2 conversations, she starts giving us attitude, like if shes the one upset and were being a hassle for her!! UHM NO! we've had a 5 hr drive, were trynna get settled in and were welcomed by ONE RUDE front desk clerk...I think we should be upset....yet, were not!! at least not yet!! she starts talking to my fiancée and hands him over his ID and just says \"I cant find anything\" we tell her it has to be a mistake....she says\"im not talking to you, im on the phone\" ....uhm ok! then she says \"is there anything else I can do for you?\" we stay quiet because SHES on the PHONE.... then she gets upset and repeats herself, so my fiancée asks her \"who are youi talking to?\" she answers back with \"well you! \" WTF??!! and she tells us if we wanna stay there for 3 nights it will be $293 with $100 deposit....with our reservation it would of been $150. NO THANKS!!!.

Grandma calls to find out what happened  apparently front desk clerk says that somehow one reservation was cancelled and the other was made for JAN.20th instead of Feb.20th. !!! 

with the poor RUDE service we got and seeing how there was only one person juggling ppl and phones I can guarantee you it was there fault for not paying attention. You cant be on the phone and trynna help someone face to face with 2 different things. Because then you get situations like this!! ...... 

Whats worse..is they tried to accommodate us...long after we were already gone...and checked into another hotel."}
{"text":"Today my family and I went to the buffet. We hadn't been there since 2016, as a family! We really enjoyed it. The fried chicken was so bomb! I smothered mine in brown gravy. I also had a carne asada taco with an orange colored salas. Bomb as well it wasn't spicy at all. I had fresh fruit, raspberry sherbet and sugar free cheesecake... The customer service was excellent and fast. Friendly atmosphere. I highly recommend, oh the price was 11.99 for brunch going into lunch. Of course it'll be cheaper if you use your rewards poi"}
{"text":"THE WORST! Total scam of a cheap hotel. Bad everything as far as the actual hotel goes: horrible bedding, thin walls, one towel. . . even the toilet sucked. If you are forced to go to Las Vegas- something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy- don't stay here. There are plenty of other hotels in this price range & I would bet any of them would be better than this lit up cardboard box."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience and would warn everyone it's only worth $75. per night.  The first night there, we discovered bugs in the room, unfortunately we didn't realize they were all over till after 12:00 am.  The next day we promptly went and complained.  We were given a new room (not an upgrade) and two buffet tickets.  On the upside the buffet was good and there is a Starbucks on site.  All in all the room is functional at very best."}
{"text":"I don't gamble but I live in Las Vegas (my mom moved us here 20 years ago). We come here mainly for the movie theater and the restaurants/food court- Baja Fresh (love this place- a discount is given to movie patrons), Panda Express, Fatburger, Starbucks, Dairy Queen, Sbarro (been to the buffet a long time ago, when this property first opened). I went to the club (tiny and crowded) a few times- also, a long time ago- in the beginning- Love Shack performed here (jeez, seems so long ago; don't know if they are still around). 

Surprisingly, in general, the casino itself is not very smoky to me, unlike many downtown properties (love that because- I'm not a smoker, and I don't want it sticking to my clothes, either). It's also not ghetto, either; lots of families come here. This is a locals' casino. There are two parking garages, as well as a parking lot in front. Head to the parking garage in the back for easy access ( ie. a shorter walk) to the movie theater (less crowded too).  Western theme with general casino design (no clocks inside, dim inside, no clear glass windows for fresh views to the outside)."}
{"text":"Really cool casino in North Vegas. Meant to look like a train station. They do get some nice shows there from time to time."}

{"text":"My review is mostly for the buffet, which at $12.99 for the Mother's Day lunch was outstanding.  My friends and I read about this spot in a web site long ago and so when we have a car, we make the trek out to this locals' place where you basically get a great buffet for 1/2 the price of the strip.  Great selection, fajita/quesadilla made-to-order guy, ribs, chicken, garlic bread, excellent chocolate cream pie.  Usually, they have a great chili bar but didn't this time.  Nice drink refilling.  Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in North Las Vegas this isn't a bad place to go, I wouldn't make a special trip from Las Vegas. This is more geared for locals, that being said, they have a wide range of restaurants, slot machines and table games with low limits always a plus. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Announcement; 38 REVIEWS ARE NOT RECCOMENDED FOR YOU NOT TO READ! besides all the UGLY, NASTY And the UN PLEASANTS REVIEWS? Oh My HIGHER MANAGEMENT PEOPLE OF STATION CASINO? what can  you do about this Place? We ate in the Buffet here twice now and the FOOD ARE FISHY AND UNCOOKED... I experienced stomach ached after I ate the CAJUN LINK or CAJUN Sausage. It was a good Sausage but they cook it rare. And the pork hock are still tough? You need to chew it FOREVER before you swallow it. It is so disguisting. The cooks came there just to work and make money, they doesn't apply the LOVE OF COOKING. it's so sad because the FOOD will go to trash instead of enjoying the tasty food. Most of the FOOD in The BUFFET are not good. What a waste. I don't think they make money o  this place? No more coming back. Please give your food to the Unfortunate People not to the Paying Customer"}
{"text":"OMG THE Texas buffet has a BBQ night for $11.99 with player card . 
   I was so excited to hear about this because it close to my home. We usually go to Boulder Station Casino Buffet Friday- Saturday for rib night THAT IS WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY  BETTER . 
Our First Clue At the Texas buffet there was no line at 6:00pm . But we payed to get in $11.99 each two of us.  Ok went to the BBQ station The brisket was dry, cold and over cook , in put bbq sauce on it cut a small pcs. Sooooooo hard dry . I was so disappointed, ribs did have flavor but not falling off the bone, like the ones at Boulder Station 
So don't waste your time or MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Older casino with perma cigarette smoke, but great selection of video poker as well as slots and table games.  The main bar is great, some very good beers on tap and excellent bartenders.  Great venue for a rock show too.  Brutal to get a taxi from after the show however!  I doubt I'd ever stay here due to the location, but nice place to do a little gambling and see a show."}

The casino itself was tacky, outdated, terribly loud, and disgustingly smokey...and I smoke, so you know that's a problem. It's like they need a new ventilation system or something because it was horrid. I've been to Santa Fe Station numerous times and Texas Station I will never go back to.

Find somewhere else if you can."}
{"text":"Been to this buffet many times. Their Mexican section is terrific. The cajun items are also delicious. The dessert selection is plentiful, which I love. Many buffets skimp on that. The carved meat is great & if you ask for a bigger slice, they gladly oblige. Honestly, when I go to a buffet, I'm there to PIG OUT! Most people are. So, atmosphere isn't a top priority. Nothing fancy about this place, but at less than $10 for lunch, so what. Leave full & happy every time!"}

{"text":"A good place to get 99-cent margaritas 'cause my cheap, hood-ass wants to feel classy for about 30 minutes sitting at a bar. I'm not an extreme cheapskate but my wallet needs some gentle lovin' during these trying times haha.

I wanna take a break from drinking a tall can of Pabst Blue Ribbon and since this job transition is taking forever (fucking manager) and I'm on a budget, I wanna get buzzed on the cheap. 

The place is obviously a locals casino and the motif is obviously Texan. Texas Station is not bad at all and they have everything: a theatre, food court, bowling alley, arcade, and a children's playplace (Kid Zone, I think).

Le Texas Station is an affordable oasis for those of us in the NW area. When I move out of the area, I don't think I'll return though, haha."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the bowling alley. Unlike the Sam's Town, this bowling alley is using Brunswick lanes and knowing that there's an ABT (Amateur Bowling Tournament) going on here, I would've suspected that this place must have maintained the lanes pretty well. I was WRONG! The brunswick lane was so dry, the balls could hardly hook at all and they had ABT here. Lesson learnt, never to participate any tournament here, it's much further from the strip than Sam's Town. Adding to that, this basement couldn't receive any cellphone signal, unlike Sam's Town, so more booo to that!"}
{"text":"OK I just want to say that me and my husband came to this location because we heard that they had to. Or we came here and stay for two days we put down $100 deposit but that hundred deposit is under my cousins name but the young lady told us that we still can get that money back as long as we have to be see my name was on the contract as well but we been here for an hour and a half since 9 o'clock this morning it is now 1041 they kept calling managers at the manager that was not here at the time of checkout the young lady at the front desk was not rude but wasn't very helpful I just want to say as a African-American woman this place we got him our money was very very poorThe right-hand don't know what the left hand is doing I am not happy at this location ever ever ever ever ever check here and less you have nowhere else to go"}
{"text":"Another stop on the off-strip casino crawl.    The inside is pretty cool looking with a western motif.  They have a bowling alley and a movie theater.  The movie theater lobby looked cool.  The parking structure is a big low building so it is easy to get into and out.  Pretty much seem to offer a lot of amenities the strip casinos offer but in a more manageable size and laid back atmosphere.  Place looks like it has been remodeled a little bit in the several years.  The outside facade looks pretty good."}

Play bingo sometimes here as well.  Lots of tables and the staff is always uber nice."}
{"text":"I have came here a few times to play craps.   Some of the dealers are extremely rude.. I dont know how they make it through there shift with out getting knocked out.   
Buffet is okay..  oyster bar is great. Movie theater are decent"}
{"text":"Like George Washington, I cannot tell a lie. Believe me when I tell you the Texas Station is a pretty nice spot. I mean, it's clearly not glitzy like The Bellagio or something, no, but that's not what this casino is trying to be. This place caters to a demographic that's a little less flash/bang/spend and more \"I live here, and the margaritas are $1!\"

Yes, the margaritas here a dollar. Yes, they also have $2 shots. Yes, that means a lot of working-class people come here to drink and take it easy after work or on a weekend. Personally, that's half the reason I come to the Texas. 

I also come here because they have a movie theater, which is pretty cool. As far as movie theaters go, this one is basic: no IMAX or anything uber cool like that. Also, Austin's Steakhouse is pretty good. I've been there a few times, and I've never disappointed in either the service or the quality of the food. They also have a bowling alley here, though I never go because I suck at bowling. The gambling here is cheap, and I've spent an hour or five at the penny slots. 

All in all, this is a cool place. I enjoy the values, the variety of things to do, and the fact that there is no Strip pretense here."}
{"text":"Texas Station casino is very nice and clean just like all the Station Casinos. Lots of slots and keno! We found it by accident on the way to the Road Kill Grill. We'd definitely go back in the future"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place? It looks dirty, with people that look like they might actually be homeless sitting at the slots, and the casino itself is practically empty. 

The buffet isn't anything to brag about either. Even for a \"locals casino\", this place sucks. Probably because it's in a terrible area. 

Yuck!"}
{"text":"This is your average \"locals\" casino.  The facility is pretty nice and there are plenty of things to do here; gamble, bowling, movies, food.  I think that this is one of the nicer local casinos when it comes to cleanliness."}
{"text":"Pretty basic casino for locals.   Sports book, bingo, slots and tables.  A bit smokey but not too bad."}
{"text":"Came to the movies on Christmas night. The theater was packed! Food court had such a long line & we get helped by a really awesome guy who I believe was @ the first cash register, older man. You don't find very nice people now a days. He had amazing customer service, popping jokes. Overall a good experience. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time trying to win any money at this place.  What a rip!  Didn't win a thing.  The sad thing is that the Station Casino's are geared towards the locals.  They don't even give any play anymore.  Just keep taking money from the people who live there to build more casino's...

Two stars for Fatburgers within the casino."}
{"text":"I heard this hotel was best for locals, so I wasn't expecting much from this hotel. I came here with my father to meet my friend and their family, who wanted to stay here because they didn't want to spend a lot of money on a hotel at the Strip, and wanted to visit Las Vegas before moving to the West Coast for a job offer. Despite the cheap price and location in a not-so-nice neighborhood, it is a fine hotel to stay at: you get the bare essentials, it is quiet at night, and you don't have to pay extra for un-necessary add-ons you would have to pay for at a hotel on the strip. It's only 5 miles away from Las Vegas Blvd, but make sure you have a car and options for parking. Also, if you stay at this hotel, you get to have an early bird breakfast for only 4 dollars, which includes pancakes, eggs and bacon or sausage."}
{"text":"This may be one of the only Vegas hotels with nice check in clerks. The buffet is great but waitresses need some training though.They aren't very friendly, mine dumped soda all over my table then just ran away without cleaning it up, I guess thinking I didn't see her. The rooms are too Smokey but I guess that's just Vegas for you. Out of the way and basic but convenient with the movie theater and bowling alley"}
{"text":"Winning!!

$1 margaritas all day, every day?!?! For real?!?!  Yes!!! And $2 tequila shots!!

Came here with the local hottie and we spent $6 for two margaritas and two additional tequila shots.  With $1 margaritas, I was expecting something along the lines of a lime slushie.  I was wrong.  For only $6 we got nice and tipsy with no wait and no cover charge.

The only drawback is that I'd be tempted to stop here on the way to work and on the way home every day if I were a local.  It's easy to develop a tequila habit when yummy margaritas are only $1  ;)"}
{"text":"Yay, another buffet that I really enjoy. I remember coming here as a child but never really paid attention to how the food was. Right when I walked in it was a pretty chill atmosphere.

As I walked the the Gambling areas I noticed that they had .01 cent machines. (fudging awesome) I walked up paid my $6.99 for the dinner buffet. They have Mexican, Chinese, Italian, Texas barbecue, and many many more options.

My server Adrian was one of the best servers I had in a longs time. She would come over very often asking if everything was OK.
Every single food I tried here was really good.

I would definitely recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER."}
{"text":"iam a local wanted to get away for night room was never cleaned had to call 4 times for maid to clean up people in casino looked homeless had to keep a eye on girlfriend didnt trust people there people  never stay there again"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on their bowling alley as I've never stayed there, or checked out the other amenities (yet! :) ). When we moved here we wanted to take up a new hobby, and bowling multiple times a week ensued. We've checked out about 6 different lanes so far, and Texas Station is our favorite. They have great prices in the morning, and usually it's relatively quiet! Everyone there is extremely nice, the lanes are clean, the gentleman in the pro shop is helpful, and the garage parking is convenient. Nothing fancy, but always fun on a budget!"}
{"text":"First time at the Texas casino. This casino is part of the station casinos. This place looks nicer than the neighboring fiesta casino. I was disappointed on the slot payouts. I played a slot machine with quick hits and bet max bets at $1.50 and hit a bonus with a multiplayer of x2 and after the bonus was over my total win was $14.00...yikes! 

Needless to say I left because it was obvious that I wasn't going to make any money as none of the 5 slots I played on paid me out with the exception of the $14.

Overall the casino does look pretty nice but again disappointed on the payouts."}
{"text":"go to the hotel  for the buffet every week sometimes to times a week pay for the new years eve prime rib buffet get seated then get told you can only have this side of the buffet where there was little to no food to eat I think that is shit  and should have been told first"}
{"text":"Booked months ago for a bowling tournament held there. When I arrived they had given my room away and we're sold out. Desk was unable to resolve issue. Manager got involved and found us a clean room,  \"Clean\"  my @$$! The bed was not properly made and there were beer bottle caps on the floor. Second star is for the bowling alley. They were great. Everything else was crap. Don't stay here."}
{"text":"Stayed here once.  And no joke, on my floor alone we saw police take down a group smoking dope in their room -- and also prostitutes walking around -- saying hello to us.  Yeah.  But other than that \"excitement\" -- it was an enjoyable stay.  The casino is nice.  The location is a tad off The Strip, but not far.  Rates were extremely low -- probably because they make money off the prostitutes on the side!"}
{"text":"Just a great locals casino in the north. The buffet has definitely improved with elevated food items, especially love prime rib nights. Only minus, food does sit for awhile because there's not really much traffic."}
{"text":"Um I just go here if I need to make a sports bet. Old and needs a facelift but not bad. Its a dirty locals place. Not really a tourist spot."}
{"text":"Horrible service they doesn't even care how long did you waited, I wait 4 hours for my room just because the waitress said change the name need time to process"}
{"text":"The hotel rooms might not be the most modern ones but they're fair for the price you pay. The room has been (mostly) clean and during our stay the location was very quit (which we were looking for). However, the fact that we had to pay an extra fee of $ 13 per day which has not been mentioned before is an unacceptable business practice not to mention the fact of price distortion."}
{"text":"I stayed in this hotel befor and I will never return again because the area is very unsafe I saw a lot of creepy thugs walking around the entrance of the hotel and around the self parking lot, it's scary place with a bunch of crackheads outside of the hotel and inside ,I found this hotel super unsafe and I would not recommend it to anyone with a family, intill Texas station owner puts better security outdoor of entrance and parking lot. If you want us to return and book more rooms please take care us and make us happy as returning customers.  Thank you hope this review is helpful to everyone."}
{"text":"This is a great place to spend the evening on dinner and entertainment. Great buffet, theatre, games, prices, etc. I like Fiesta Rancho as well."}
{"text":"This hotel has a tacky feel to it. Despite being relatively well maintained. Lower class neighborhood. Plus, our room had a view of a wall only, about 5 feet away. We were on the 3rd floor so we could see the ground, but no sky and nothing but wall no matter how we stretched and craned our necks. I know a hotel needs to rent all available rooms, but how about a discount for a \"cell\" of a room ? Or at least a warning when checking in ?

They manage two stars due to staff. Everyone we dealt with was pleasant with one exception. The lady in the gift shop was a bit surly."}
{"text":"If only  zero Stars were available. It was a 3 night stay over Christmas- The lack of hospitality provided by 2 of 3 front desk staff, all the cocktail servers, and the rudeness of woman who staffed the gift shop all weekend were disappointing. 
The fact the doors and walls were so thin that we could hear people fighting in the halls, a baby screaming all night we were waking every 45 minutes was exahsting. Not to mention the unsafe feeling due to the type of people allowed to roam the casino begging for cigarettes and punching machines. I have never been in a casino where my husband did not feel good leaving me to step upstairs for a minute. Nor have I ever been in a Las Vegas hotel where some of our family had to switch rooms due to security's inability to control a loud parties in other rooms or have had a Security Guard literally shrug their shoulders when we complained that our entire hallway reeked of marijuana. Texas Station was the first. 
Having to get up at 1245 in the morning to have our AC replaced was inconvenient. Having a machine get stuck and sitting for 20 mins with no response to a service light was frustrating. We were understanding that it was a holiday- however as paying customers we do not anticipate being penalized with a short staffed facility and staff that are not only upset to be working but taking it out on us. 
The entire experience left our entire family saying never a \"Station\" hotel again."}
{"text":"Spent a few nights here while working security for a weekend event. The hotel is huge, just like the state of Texas. There is plenty to do on the ground floor (gamble, drink, and dine). The free drinks are terrible, my cranberry vodka tasted as if I was drinking Clorox. Gross.

Rooms inside are clean and free of bad smells. The beds are really comfortable, I was surprised! My only complaint in the room I was while staying in, was the shower head. The one located in my room was broken. It took a while to shower, as it would leak out the side or have periods of poor water pressure.

I do wish they would have done a better job addressing the marijuana smoke that could be seen and smelled throughout the 3rd and 4th floor near the elevators. Great place to stay while in Vegas, even won $50 bucks."}
{"text":"This is ridiculous, cannot check in til 3p, even though I'm sure it not busy or sold out, so what do they do between 11a and 3p, just stand there. What a waste of my time, I wanted to check in around 2p.. my family wanted to stay here for the cheaper rate, unfortunately too far from most casinos.
Lots of slots and table games to chose from.
Love the oyster bar and easy parking, plus just a little smoky in casino.."}
{"text":"Texas Station is not a casino for tourists, it's one for the community of Las Vegas.  Which isn't to say they shove you out the door if they find you're not Nevadan, but you're not going to be wooed with free slot play and half-price show tickets.  

It's mostly 5-cent and penny slot machines, coupled low-stakes card playing.  The movie theater and food court are decent enough for a local casino, but the gem here is Austin's Steakhouse.   It has great steaks at a 20-40 dollar course range, fine for special occasions.  

The rest of the casino is sort of middling.  Even the casino drink girls are a six out of ten.  The sportsbook is cramped and has about 20 free seats.  Definite local casino.  Again, if you get trapped in it, hide at the steakhouse!"}
{"text":"The Texas has clean machines and excellent cocktail service.  I won $200 after playing for only 30 minutes.  If you play the tables at night, you'll be entertained by some young thing dancing on a table right in your line of sight.  I like the Texas and I recommend it."}
{"text":"We stay at the Texas Station once a year. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The buffet is actually pretty good. I am not usually a buffet person. We tried Austin's steak which I give 5 stars. The kids have plenty to do from bowling to a movie or the arcade. I would and have recommended friends to the Texas Station."}
{"text":"This is where I came to see Lorreta Lynn on Saturday night and although the area is incredibly scary (we are talking don't make eye contact/lock your doors scary) once inside you can forget that.

You can get a patron margarita for $10!!!

Not the best selection of what I like to call adult video games (slots) but they have enough to keep you occupied. On Saturday if you had a card for the hotel, frequent customer, as long as it was in a machine you had the chance to win $500! Cool deal. 

The biggest plus for me about this place was the people, EVERYONE was nice. A huge relief and change from the strip where you are a barcode of a person."}
{"text":"We stayed on a Monday night for $30.23 (Used a Groupon deal 15.68/night and 14.55 resort fee) It also came with a coupon book.

- Not very many people come here apparently. We got parking right next to the hotel!
- Upon check in, the black guy at front desk says, \"so are you gonna be like him and give me a hard time too? Complain about the $100 deposit!\" LOL. \"You know I ain't got my readers on, Go head and read me your address!\" Come on now...
- \"Oh no more king rooms available. I'll put you in 2 queens.\" WTF.
- Coupon book came with 1 play of free bowling. $3.75 for shoe rental. 
- Horrible fitness center. 2 treadmills but only one working. The tread of the one that is working is coming apart! fail. 
- Hotel room like Palace Station. 3 Star. Great view of a wall! YAY! 
- I agree with Tera, I have ATT and had poor reception at the hotel. 
- Don't play blackjack here. 6:5 6 deck. boo. 
- We ate the Grand Cafe at midnight and got the $1.99 special. Great value."}
{"text":"I wish they had negative stars to describe my experience with the hotel. We were required to stay here for our softball tournament and booked a room with 2 queen beds so my daughter would have a place to sleep. The hotel called us at around 5:30 pm and didn't leave a message. I called them back immediately to make sure that there wasn't an issue with our room. The gentleman who answered was very reassuring and told me there was no issue with my reservation and that he would add notes for a late check-in and make sure our room was held since we were still at the softball fields. When we arrived at the hotel to get our room. We were informed by the lady at the front desk who had the looks and personality of someone who's parents had met on ancestry.com that our only option was a king bed smoking or non-smoking. Our room had been given to someone else, even though they insisted that our room was not given away because they had a single king bed room available. The manager and employee continued to inform us that when you book with any of the Station Properties that your room choice is simply a preference and not guaranteed. That the room choice is really first come first serve and there is no real promise to give you the \"bedding type\" that you paid for. They told us that we could not have our money back and that they would charge us if we chose to stay or not. So to summarize our experience; never ever stay at the Texas Station hotel. Apparently all the Station Casinos feel the same way so beware of booking at any of their properties."}
{"text":"This is a nice casino for the locals, or people who want to escape the vibe on the strip. The atmosphere here is laid back, and the cocktail service is usually prompt. 

The machines at the bar tend to be a little tight, which you'll find to be the case at most casinos. I found some nickel machines at the end of the Whiskey Bar however, that let me play for a while, while the bartender brought me refills without me even having to ask."}
{"text":"Roaches and porn!!! 

Well it's not my usual type of hotel tht I would stay in, this looks old and smells like smoke as soon as you walk in the casino.  We're only here for the fight, otherwise I'd be near or on the strip.

Ok so first off, we wanted two queens cuz our daughter is with us and a king is just a little cramped, but they couldn't help us.  Then, the room smelled musty and the ac didn't work correctly.  Then I was flipping channels and 3 of them had porn on them, luckily my daughter had her head buried in her Itouch.  We told the front desk and they said that they'll run for 24 hrs after the person ordered them. I think hotels should be able to shut them off as soon as the person checks out. What if my daughter had been paying attention?? That is unacceptable!!!  Then to top it off, I was in bed and looked down to turn the lamp off and saw a roach staring at me. Tht was it!! It turns out that it was only a grasshopper but that's still creepy!! They told us they were completely sold out but then they ended up moving us to a larger room!!!  

On a positive note I do have to say that the staff is extremely nice, in the entire hotel and casino!!"}
{"text":"Ok I never understood what a station was until I came here. It's like how they have those fast food/gas stations together...it's kinda gross but convenient because it's two in one. This place has \"crack heads\" galore. The guys are disgusting and will try to hit on you even walking from the elevator to the front door. The food is whatever, best food was in the cafe area. Don't bother playing the machines they don't pay out at all and you'll be wasting you money. The bed was uncomfortable and has tiny pillows. I'm pretty sure the chair had a cum stain on it. Walking in the hall way you can hear everything going on in every room. No refrigerator or coffee pot in the room so no need to save your left overs but I think if you like stations this is probably a decent one lol but I don't know because this is my first experience at one. I'm giving it two stars because it's convenient (everything in one area) and because it was a good price. If you are one a budget this is better than a motel 6."}
{"text":"The rooms looks old, the beds are hard, all the decor is dated or beat up or in rough shape. It is deafly not one of the best station properties, we probably will not stay here ever again until upgrades are made to the rooms.  They need to spend some of that UFC money on up grading this property."}
{"text":"The only reason I ever come to Texas Station is for the oyster bar. They have those lobster pan roasts that are so delicious. Tides at Sante Fe used to have the same menu, but closed a few years ago. We dined here recently at the oyster bar then played slots and tables for a while afterwards. The casino has really gone down in ambiance and decor in the last few years, but this may be due to the current clientele. The last time I saw a movie here, there was a fight in the lobby in front of the ticket counter. This seems to be the ghetto version of the Sante Fe. They have a food court, Kidsquest, etc, but nothing other than the oyster bar to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Family in town, so we're making the rounds with them trying many different casinos, looking for the \"big win\".  I think it's more like they are contributing to our economy, go mom!

Walking around the casino floor, its seems they have spread out the machines, they do not seem to be so crowded, but I noticed they have cut back on some of the table games.  But I do not fear, nearing the holidays, I am sure they will soon move things around again.

Overall, not a bad casino, clean, a little worn, but still a good place to meet with family for a fun night of gambling."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of all the casinos, mainly because there's a lot for me to do here. Great for non-smokers. There are areas and I can go and I can't smell cigarettes at all."}
{"text":"damn i love this place!! wooo hoooo!!!. buffet was great!! like always...i lost $100 at the tables...and made it all back and then some on the slot machine!!! yeah boy!! i am always coming here!! no matter what!! love this place to death!!! wooooohoooooo!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yee to the freaking haw.

I was born and raised in Texas, so when I feel homesick, I go to Texas Station.  Seeing the cast impressions of jalapenos on those support columns always hit the spot to make me feel better.

Okay, so it's not that bad, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little charmed and amused by the theme.

I like \"locals\" casinos.  They don't try to be anything big and flashy, they just try to be.  And they carry the \"Texas\" thing enough without overkill.  I don't see a lot of cowpokes with handlebar moustaches that you could swing from like a child's gymnasium, nor do I see belt buckles so large that you could eat a meal off of (If you're wondering, \"Tall Tales\" are part of any good Texan's verbal repertoire, so I'm just keeping to theme.  It's vital to this review, you see).

I've yet to try the restaurants here, though they do look good enough to be put on my personal \"To Do\" list.  I doubt that I'll ever book a room here, but I do like their movie theater.  It's actually really nice, and the staff there is top notch.  Seriously, I'm always impressed with the service there.

The casino itself can get a little smoky at times, and some of the kids that hang around there are kind of sketchy, but I'm not filled with a sense of dread when I walk around.  I find this key to a good casino experience.

There may be no basement in the Alamo, but in this instance, I'm glad that there is some \"Texas\" in this particular Station.  Sure, nobody adds a drawl to conversation, breaks into impromptu hoedowns, or claps in unison after the first two lines of \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\", but it definitely fits the bill for my synthetic down home experience."}
{"text":"I highly DO NOT recommend to rent a room at this property, especially if you use MARIJUANA. The front desk agent who checked us in was very kind. She gave me a form to initial and sign, with one line stating that although we were in a smoking room, marijuana was not allowed to be smoked in the room. That was perfectly fine with me, or else I wouldn't have initialed and signed the form. I gave them $100 in incidentals to ensure no damages to the room per the contract I signed. 

When we got to the room, a shampoo bottle was laying on the floor of the room and the fire detector was off the wall. From my experience working in the hotel industry, I understand housekeeping is very busy and they work hard to maintain the quality of the rooms thus why it wasn't a big deal that a couple things were missed in the room by housekeeping. I also understand that an employee probably will not admit to failing to tell their supervisor about the tampered fire alarm.

I had marijuana in the room, which is legal in the state of Nevada. Because of the paperwork I signed, I left the hotel room twice in order to smoke. Apparently you can't have any evidence of marijuana ever being in the room (which was not specified in the contract) or you'll be accused of smoking it in the room. For anyone who smokes, just don't bring it to the room or they'll keep your $100 incidental deposit. 

They apparently made their own law that marijuana is illegal in their hotel and are taking advantage of the fact I'm a 23-year-old who provided an Illinois ID. Is it more typical for a young adult to not obey the rules? Was I taken advantage of because of my age, or because they assumed I don't travel to Vegas often? I can only assume that.

The incompetent employees who treated me like a criminal said they did not have proof I smoked it in the room, only that it was in the room. The incompetent manager, Greg, said the same thing but that he \"believed me\" and \"how deeply sorry he was that he couldn't refund me my $100\" which is false. I was trained to know whether marijuana was smoked in the room or if the smell of present marijuana was simply lingering in the room, but yet Greg promised me that his manager Amalia (spelling?) agreed with him. 

Greg wouldn't give me the number to corporate which I found odd, but only informed me that I can speak to the general manager, Stacy Stagg, who I am only assuming is as incompetent as the management she hired. 

The property looked really cool from the outside and was very close to the dispensary I LEGALLY purchased the marijuana from, so I decided to stay for a night. I liked the fact that parking was so close to the entrance of the hotel also. It is a great property that is disappointingly poorly managed.

I've never had anyone steal from me, and this establishment accomplished that. They lost a customer who wanted to come back, but now won't because they would rather have my $100 that was not deserved. I was punished for a housekeeper's lack of responsibility and for being a 23-year-old out-of-towner who simply possessed LEGAL MARIJUANA. 

For anyone else who has had issues with this property and are not being provided the number to corporate, it is 702-495-3000."}
{"text":"It's a nice quiet place for people who love to relax and want to be far away from the chaotic Vegas Strip.  I love the fact that this particular casino has a movie theater, bowling alley and a variety of restaurants... 

Down side, their buffet food isn't the greatest, but it isn't worst either. I didn't win anything at this place... Poor me!"}
{"text":"PLEASE dont waste your time or money going here! We got 2 nights king room for our 1 year anniversary (before going to a gifted timeshare) and im so glad I ddnt stay longer than 2 nights. 1st off our tub was DIRTY im talkin someones booger, hair and lotion on the wall of the freaking shower. The bed looked worn.   ( u shaped) and had a possible adjoining room so we heard our neighbors cussing out their kids and being loud in the am. Didnt mind all the black people, didnt feel \"unsafe\" but the hallway smelt like weed strongly. And no ac in halls. Even for a good deal of less than $40 for both nights (groupon) I wouldnt go again. Pool is pitiful thats y they dont even mention they have one. Not kidding. Hot tub size pretty much. Didnt use it. Just overall not a great experience at all. Bowling alley sucks. Movie theatre is average. Bleh. Thats about it. Will NEVER EVER come again. 

 They also sent me an email saying I had a reservation for the day I checked out,  to come check back in for 1 night so I had to call once I had already left. Waited on phone 10 minutes only to be told they had no record of a reservation and that my card wouldnt be charged again. Bars are closed or stink...seriously"}
{"text":"As Casino's go, this isn't the most exciting or the most glamerous.  In fact, it is simply one of the average Station Casinos.  That said, the buffet is a great deal, they still have some old school slot games and I found $3.00 blackjack the other day.   If you want to make your money go farther, $3.00 blackjack is the way to go.  

Like so many other casinos, you walk in and immediately smell like smoke for the rest of the day.  I can't last 1 hour in herear without my allergies acting up.
They still have some of the older slots and I won 30 dollars playing Texas Tea.

All your Station Rewards work here and it is usually less crowded than Red Rock!

For bargain value a 3 star but they need some renovations to get overall 3 stars.  Still, if you want lower gambling limits and less crowds, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"So I'm not one to complain....ever. Went to check in, I went to hotel registration to check in. I had made the reservation in mine and my husband's names. The women at the desk told me my name was not on the reservation and she could not help me.....i had walked across the very large parking lot while my husband sat in the the vehicle with our sleeping children. To say I was upset is nice....i then had to walk across the parking lot again. The the same women was overly sweet to my husband and very accommodating. Not a nice start to a stressful work week!!!!"}
{"text":"Texans You will be so disappointed if you ever visit this Casino and Buffet. Horrible Buffet All the food was old & day before left overs. Once they ran out of food thats it! Nothing was made fresh, rude chefs poor attitudes just a bad overall experience. We will never be back here, folks that come here either come here to die or come here to play bingo. Id recommend a bulldozer to level this Casino then build a new Casino true to Texas roots that Texans can be proud and brag & appreciate ! 
This Casino is going down hill fast with no brakes .
If you ever decide to come here then like the old saying goes you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"This casino/hotel isn't one of my favorite places to gamble, but it is one of the places I do like to eat. The oyster bar does has some slammin' seafood and there is also a nice place to catch a buffet with variety. This place isn't all that enticing to come to if you're going to gamble, but if it is a a place close to your house, I wouldn't mind coming here at all rather than hitting the strip."}
{"text":"If I could give them NO stars I would. Never should you be flying all day and get to a hotel and they say \"Oh sorry we have no rooms but the one way across town does. Go there or we can cancel this reservation PENALTY FREE.\" It is SO INCONSIDERATE TO DO THAT. People have been driving and flying all day long. The LEAST they could've done was call the people who had reservations and let them know what was going on instead of standing behind the desk looking ridiculous and just casually telling people they have no rooms drive 25-30 across town to this other hotel. Very poor management."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this Buffet 3 times, always give em at least 3....The food was absolutely horrible, dried pans of food on the line, staff serving the the ribs/bbq was an absolute dull uncaring individual and after the 3rd time, we will never eat there again.  The only thing that was decent was the salad, tho not much to choose from....I mean how can you screw up that.  There is a digital billboard inside that states: \"Voted best in Las Vegas\"....NOT TRUE  You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place was a little smokey but other than that rooms were clean and nice the bars were fun and the steak house was really amazing I'll be coming back next year."}
{"text":"I didn't stay at the hotel or gambled. I actually came here for the buffet. The buffet prices are wonderful $11.99/adult, and my 3 and 2 years old were free. Go there expecting a Rio setting, but without a doubt the food was delightful. This casino also has a kids care; they watch your kids while you lose money. There's also a movie theater in the casino, next to a ticket game/arcade and a bowling alley - which i didn't get to check out. This is my 3rd time there, and I always enjoy it. Minus the 2 stars because they need to improve the ventilation up in there."}
{"text":"Like this casino and hotel. Especially the theaters with the matinee special for senior day which is Wednesday before 4:00pm. Costs is now $4.00 for seniors.  But they did raise the age qualifications from 50 years old and over to 60 years old and over which was a little surprised with the change but still can't beat the price on senior matinee day.  Actually the person I talked to gave the wrong information about $ & age? Senior Day is now Thursdays! 50+. Sorry, Alliante Casino is discount day not Texas Casino & Hotel. WiFi in casino is free. Price for senior discount on Wednesday you can't beat. Bringing your children to movies here would be fine. Also, arcade for children to have some fun. For a local casino and movie theater,  definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not one thing to be disappointed in thus far.  There was a short wait at checkin but when it was our turn, Kimiko took extraordinary care and patience with us, granting all our requests to the letter.  We asked for room on the top floor as far from the smoky casino as possible, with a nice view of the pool and Strip.  Only three room from elevator and ice machine.... Convenient and no noise.

I see people complaining about the rooms... Well, they weren't staying in this room.... Clean, comfy with two nice chairs, king bed with a new firm mattress.  What's to complain about?  Nothing except maybe a desk would be preferable to the small little telephone table on the opposite of the room from the bed, but not a biggy!

I found the casino to be clean, huge and filled with lots of slots, nice bars and eating establishments.  Thanks Texas Station!  Your place rocks for this old lady from Tucson!"}
{"text":"** Casino Only**

Been here many times over the years just to gamble,

It is a bit far for tourists to stay here and go to the strip but it is more of a locals casino,

It is part of the station casinos which you can use your players card here as well. We have been here for the buffet too.

As for the casino it is nothing fancy.  We have played slot machines a bunch of times and have never won anything worth speaking of. 

It is a pretty good size casino and they have a good amount of slot machines. When you play here you do get buffet specials.

We don't go out of our way to go here only if we are in the area."}
{"text":"I get there at 12 according to my cell phone girl is there sitting on her butt and said she doesn't open until her clock says 12 and her clock says 11:56. Okay so we wait and then she says they need the shot records which can't transfer from the red rock. Ok so then she let's us know she can look them up. So our movie was 12:15, twenty minutes later she sees the youngest isn't 2 1/2 and there's not enough employees to cover, they need 3 of them there's only 2. She couldn't see the girl was 1? Really? And they need three employees for three kids!? Girl was rude, lazy, and ignorant. They need staff that actually likes kids, and knows what they're doing. Horrible place!!!!!! Red rock is way better!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday paid 38,99 for two people. Don't waste your money, go to Paris, Rio or Bellagio for that kind of money. 

What a rip off! The only thing there that was semi good was the pork spare ribs.. except that.. everything was pretty crap!

I did Rio.. it was a lot better buffet for almost the same amount of money. 

Also there were a lot of cigarette smoke in there from the Casino!

Parently on Wednesdays its only $12.. I say.. go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a big casino with all the expected Station amenities. I'd never spent a significant amount of time here before, and I guess it was a little better overall than I expected. I did notice all the Texas themes throughout the casino, which carry into the restaurants and some bars. 
Parking was pretty easy, with garage access from Lake Mead. 

The \"showroom\" was a conference room with weird seating, and they were too close together. Luckily, the seat next to me on one side was unoccupied. I was there for Peabo Bryson, and the show was great, with nice stage lighting. Prior to the show, I paid a visit to the Martini Bar, which serves free potato chips made at Austin's Steakhouse. They also have very big martini glasses. All the better to indulge in a coffee martini! Be sure to check out the chandeliers in this bar. Live music on Friday nights is Motown, which is a reason to return."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite casino, even though the bells started going off and I \"won\" 500 pennies, which I promptly returned.  I do like some stuff here, namely it's still $1 per point, unlike MGM.  But now they're starting to roll in those .40 and .50 minimum bet penny machines, just like the Big Boys, and that pisses me off.  I like playing slots as a mindless diversion.  I don't like to lose more than $40 or $50.  I never go with the idea that I'm going to win, so I'm never disappointed.  I NEVER WIN!!  EVER.  If I come out a couple of dollars ahead, I\"m satisfied.  But you can't do that with a machine that gobbles all your money in two minutes. I'll wait and see if this trend continues here. 

The other feature I like at Texas Station is the Texas-shaped pavers that lead to the entrance doors.  Nice touch.  But not much, eh?"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this being a wonderful stay. I had made my reservations in advance and paid in full in advance. The front desk was very nice a little slow with the people ahead of me, but I can understand language barriers when they're dealing with people who barely speak English. I then got my turn and check-in was handled easily. So I went off to my room. As I went into the room I noticed there were ashtrays. As I had paid in advance for a non-smoking room so I immediatly went back to the front desk. At the front desk I was told then my reservation held me a spot in the hotel, but did not guarantee non-smoking I said this was unacceptable and I needed to have it fixed I was told there was one other room in the place and it too was a smoking room. I walked away as the clerk repeated their policy, in a wonderfully smooth voice. I am sure that this verbage was repeated any times to many people. When I pay in advance and make my request, I expect it to be there. This is a dealbreaker and will forever put this beautiful facility on the buyer beware list. I won't be returning, ever.
 The room was clean I got to give them that and did not have a smoky smell to it.  I got to give it to them that they clean very well, but I was extremely disappointed and upset that I didn't get what I paid for in advance. For this reason I'm going to give them a pretty low review no matter what the rest of the facility. Yes the parking was wonderful and easy,  OK for water pressure was great, The towels were nice okay. The TV works great,  but give me what I paid for in advance or tell me in advance that you're going to give me whatever you damn well please when I get there. Beware go somewhere else there are many choices in Las Vegas, I will be using them"}
{"text":"Off the strip, but excellent price ($60 a night). Don't get fleeced by $200-500 a night joints on the strip.

Very clean, quiet room for a casino/hotel.

Very fast check-in and check-out.

Free wireless Internet access.

They also have fast food places inside."}
{"text":"The buffet here is really quite good, and inexpensive too.  Their made to order al pastor tacos are really good !!!  They make chicken and beef fajitas too and they are very good too.  Its a great place for lunch.  The only downside is the screaming children that sometimes populate the place, but at least they seem NOT to handle the food on the buffet line, so its not too bad."}
