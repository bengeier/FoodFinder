{"text":"I don't write a ton of reviews unless I am struck negatively or very positively. This restaurant did both.

Upon arriving the front hostess stand made us feel like a burden and unwelcome. \"Oh sorry you can't have a drink at the bar, we require to be sat....BUT you can hang out over in that one section.\" Ummmm OK? So we have taken a chance on patronizing your new business and are made to feel like nuisances. Not cool. I think that this restaurant should work on messaging this in a  MUCH nicer way. Like...HEY! we are so happy you are trying us out. We want you to hang out while we find you a table and Tony over at the bar would be happy to serve you!?\" That might be better.

We had walked a mile from our apt to get there, so stayed to try the drinks which were fabulous! I wanted to hate them but I didn't. Perfection.

But the hostess again, BIG MISS....\"I can seat you but are you going to order food?\" Ummmm yeah, do we need to qualify with a spend to qualify for a freaking table. RUDE. 

Anyway, we sat down and the food was awesome. Glazed Carrots. SO GOOD. Avacado lobster toast. YES! 

My advice, the restaurant needs to work on charm and treating it's customers like guests. They have nailed the food. Work on that and I will give you 5 stars."}
{"text":"From start to finish this did not disappoint. Great service. The staff was knowledgeable about the cocktails and the menu. Then the food. It was so good. You have to try the carrots, yes I'm telling you to order carrots. The portions were perfect size for tapas. Generous and perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out for a date night at Zeppelin over their opening weekend and our overall experience was fantastic. The food was delicious, and our server Brittney was friendly and attentive. Our biggest complaint is that they do not accept reservations, but instead use the no wait app. You can't put your name on the list until you're within 5 miles of the restaurant and with a 60 minute wait, you're still waiting quite a while in the restaurant. As for the food, it is tapas style, and it all came out about the same time. The collards and apples salad was delicious! The Granny Smith apples, sweet potatoes, and collards mesh so well together I almost forgot I was eating a salad! The Maine Lobster and Avocado Toast was very flavorful, and presented very nicely. Our \"entree\" was the buttermilk poached kettle fried chicken. The server told us when we ordered that it was spicy, she did not tell a lie. I've never tried Nashville hot chicken, but it has to be of a similar spice level. The habanero vinaigrette really puts a kick in this dish. If you don't like spice, I would pass on the chicken even though it was very good, I think... (my mouth may still be on fire). Overall a great restaurant where you can relax without being rushed and have a delicious meal."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place but were so disappointed. 

Firstly, the wait times on the No Wait app are completely inaccurate. It told us to arrive at 7:56, but when we arrived the hostess said it would be another 30 minutes but that we could order a drink at a small side section of the bar. Apparently they seat at the bar, so they try to avoid people going to the main part to get drinks, which that part I understand...but seating at the bar after waiting hours? Anyway, we got drinks (giggle water and room to grow), and the cocktails were pretty good and pretty much what you expect to pay for cocktails at this kind of restaurant. We stood outside on the deck with the heaters to avoid the crazy crowdedness inside. I do appreciate the heaters and am grateful that the rain held out. We checked on our place in line an hour later (yes, this is an hour after we have already waited an hour and after the additional 30 minutes quoted by the hostess), and she says ANOTHER 30 minutes (*jaw drops to floor*). We've already waited so long that we decide to wait it out. Another 30 minutes later, she says our table is ready. 10 minutes later, we sit down. (End of waiting saga/rant, but the people must know what awaits). 

Finally a table! YES! And we are so ready to eat. We wanted to start with a charcuterie board, but the prices were way higher on the actual menu than website menu, and we decided not worth it. (Side note: we love charcuterie's and didn't want to sour our charcuterie love with what had not been a not promising experience so far). Based on our tastes and the waitress's recommendations, we got the carrot, cabbage, and hushpuppy smalls. The carrots tasted really good especially with the ricotta, but were all cooked to different levels so some were really soft while others were almost raw. The cabbage was nice and tender but kind of tasted like your standard cabbage. We enjoyed the hush puppies, which were basically fancy hush puppies with bbq pork cheeks on top, so how could you go wrong. We were pretty full at this point, but didn't feel satisfied so we decided to order a big--the fried chicken, which a friend had recommended. I am glad to report, this was the best thing we had all night! Yay finally! The chicken was so tender and had a nice thin crispy breading. It also had a subtle smoked flavor and kind of spicy mixture underneath.

Side note: it was SO loud in there. No sound absorption at all so everything echoed. We had to yell across the table and could barely hear the waitress.

So--was the food good once we finally got to eat it: yes. Was it worth the wait: absolutely not. Based on the quality of the food, I would have been willing to wait 30 min. In total from getting in line to leaving, we spent 3.5 hours with Zeppelin. Aka way too much time. If we hadn't been misquoted so many times and had know this from the beginning, we probably would have just gotten a cocktail and left. 

To sum up this way too long review: Zeppelin is worth trying if you have a lot of time to wait and expect to be misquoted on wait time. Otherwise, there are a lot of restaurants in Charlotte with just as good or better food and cocktails for around the same price (or less)."}
{"text":"Couldn't have had a better night out than last night at Zeppelin! Fantastic setting, knservice, enticing menu and"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for small plates and craft cocktails. It is relaxed and unpretentious. Prices are average but portions are generous.  I am a bourbon drinker and their Edison, Vieux Carré, and La Louisiane were perfect. Service was prompt and bartenders were knowledgeable and patient with my questions. Chef Vince suggested tuna tartare, glazed carrots, scallops, hush puppies, and calamari. They were all fabulous. We will be back and hope you would try this fun place!!"}
{"text":"Ok .. so I know this place is new .. it has a great location , but other than that .. you ask how it is ?? Well, if you consider waiting 3 1/2 hrs ok for food , or being served sub par food ok, or perhaps waiting  too long for the check to arrive .. or the horrible \"no wait\" app that drastically under calculates wait time .. or maybe even having the manager sitting down at the bar and drinking before all customers have left for the night ok ... then you might like this place.

From what I found out , 2/3 owners have no previous restaurant experience.  The manager on duty supposedly had 15 years of fine dining experience , yet she looked no older than 30.  She was not apologetic now did she stay around to field any questions or concerns .. she spent most of the 3 hours I was waiting, standing at the back of the restaurant while the poor hostess had to deal with all the onslaught from waiting customers.. 
although we did get 2 free apps... which again , I thought were ok. 

It's sad to me to see all these new and exciting places popping up around south end and all of Charlotte , but with sub par food and service .. especially coming from the service industry and doing my time in customer relations.  Communication and feedback are key !  To say I will NOT being going back to this place is an understatement !"}
{"text":"Stopped at this ambient spot while visiting friends in Charlotte. Absolute love! The food is amazing; Maine lobster and avocado French toast, tomato caprese, and to top it all off lamb ribs. The meat on the lamb was soooo tender it was like Ángels making love in my mouth. The wait staff is patient and all knowing, it's a win win."}
{"text":"I love this little spot. Locally owned and they couldn't have picked a better location. The drink selection is amazing; there is something for everyone. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. And let me tell ya about the patio and the music; it was great! That night they were playing a playlist from the late 90s and my friends and I really enjoyed it.  I had the Fried Green Tomato Caprese and it was memorable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were incredible!!! Beer and wine list was impressive . Music was fun and all the small plates were on point. We had the aged duck the yellowtail crudo, wagyu tartare, and the peppadew all were delicious and presentation was really cool. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"I was invited to Zepplin by a friend to meet up for a \"girls night\". This place is definitely a little hidden. I actually even got the entrance confused with the place next door (some burger place). It doesn't seem that the burger place and Zeppelin (which seems to be a little bit more higher end) should be as close together as they are. However I do like the outdoor set up (lots of loungers/couches). The burger place next door has picnic tables with umbrellas. I'm sure duing the summer this will be a great hangout spot.

The restaurant is really quaint. not as large as it appears online but really cute. The food is served Tapas style which I wasn't all for...until I actually ate. OMG!!! The food here is THE BOMB!!!! As a table, we decided to just order a few small plates and share (that was our servers suggestion). We ordered the scratch buns, kettle fried chicken, hush puppies,scallops, and Rictota Gnocchi. In my opinion ALL the food was good. However as a group we felt the Notorious P.I.G. puppies, Fried Chicken and Scallops were our favorite! The food is very well seasoned! Definitely order just a few items for a group. You can always decide later if you want more, and the food comes out pretty quick (which makes sense since the menu is so limited). 

To drink I ordered the Paloma De La Parrilla. It was good. A little too bitter for my taste but I did ask for something not sweet and this was the recommendation. It has salt on the outside of the glass which is cool. I would have preferred sugar. I will probably order it again and get the sugar on the outside instead. I only needed one drink as that 1 did the trick! Everyone agreed the drinks were great!

Our server was really sweet and offered great suggestions on how the food should come out.

This place gets 5 stars not just because the food was good but because the music was ON POINT!!! They seemed to play mostly hip hop and R&B which I LOVED. It was mostly 90s and 00's music and I was jamming the whole night! I also appreciated the restaurant wasn't super packed and the music wasn't too loud. It was just right.
There's a parking lot they share with the burger place that I was able to park in. There is off street parking as well.

I DEFINITELY will be returning to Zepplin. I can't wait to have another girls night or even bring my husband back."}
{"text":"I didn't eat a full meal at Zeppelin, but I met some friends out last night to have a drink and a taste of some yummy charcuterie... 
I'll start with the atmosphere which is pretty cool given the eclectic 90s throwback playlist... I love the bare wood roof ceilings... the place is cozy without being TOO small, but I'd suggest coming early (RIGHT after work, as it seems to fill up fast!!)
For my drink, I felt I just had to have the Edison... an Old Fashioned brought on a tray, covered in a bell jar filled with wood smoke... it was a lovely drink to look at, and even better to enjoy sipping on the smoky classic with the treat of a liquor soaked cherry at the end!  
We split a tray with duck prosciutto (which melted in my mouth), Spanish chorizo, cheddar, goat cheese, triple cream brie, and the fog bleu... served with little blintz pancakes, whole grain mustard, and house made pickles... the ONLY thing that could've made this tray better would be to have had some sort of crackers at the ready as there were not enough vehicles for the cheese/meat in the mini blintzes... They did bring us some chips, which was very helpful!!
All of these were served to us by a waiter named Tony who was as friendly as he was knowledgeable about the menu!  

All in all, we REALLY enjoyed our visit, and I'm looking forward to coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Awesome original dishes. Mainly small plates. My top favorite dishes were the calamari, the roasted carrots, wagyu tartare, roasted cabbage and the collard salad. I'm not normally a healthy veggie eater but every veggie dish was packed with lots of flavor. All the cocktails are very creative as well but I'm a sucker for a restaurant that serves sake and they have sake bottles available. They also play hip hop from the 90s and who doesn't enjoy a little throwback rap music."}
{"text":"Honestly.... the ambience is nice and the environment is fun and hip. However, the selection seemed a little limited as far as food. Our appetizer took about 20 minutes to come out and it was just cheese. Our sever was very quiet and awkward, he made the experience very uncomfortable for us.

Biggest issue with this place will be the pricing. We paid $17 for a regular old fashioned. We spent $60 on two drinks and a small appetizer, blew our mind. Won't be back since we can get a lot more for our buck somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great cocktails and good, friendly service! Enjoyed the snacks as well - calamari was good and hush puppies as well. Would like a few lighter options to munch on but since the menu changes seasonally will be back soon to see the summer menu!"}
{"text":"I tried to make it to this place when it first opened, but came on a Monday and they weren't open.  I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to make it back over there.  Everything was outstanding.

Our friendly bartender Shane(who I recognized from Soul) made us all some amazing drinks.  The uncle Eddy is a perfect hand crafted cocktail.  Waygu fat washed bourbon with a cold smoke on it, quite a beautiful presentation as well.  After that I didn't really pay attention to what everybody else was drinking, but I heard no complaints.

On to the food.  We ate A LOT of it, lol.  One dish that really stood out was the waygu beef tartar with truffle egg.  The truffle egg was a little pungent for my taste, as the beef was amazing on its own.  The perfect little chips for dipping topped it off nicely.  The diver scallops were above and beyond as well.  Perfectly cooked.  I was hesitant about the bread crumbs, but they worked.  The celery root puree was a nice touch.

Everything else we had was superb, I just thought those 2 dishes were noteworthy.  The chicken was super juicy, brined, but not overkill on the spices in the brine.  The Burrata on the fried green tomato caprese was extremely tasty.  The calamari was on point, the pork bun was great and the yellowtail crudo was delicious, too.

One of the better meals I have had in Charlotte in some time.  Don't hesitate to ask questions.  There are some terms on the menu that may not be relatable, but the staff is quite knowledgeable.  Also, some older folks might not like the modern music, but I don't see it being a deal breaker.  

I'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Cocktails are interesting and the food was very good. The yellowfin crudo and the tomato and burrata salad were highlights."}
{"text":"Disappointed.   Saturday night was very busy and the food was meh.   Just okay. 
Drinks were pricey, 
very well made but too sweet for my taste.   
we had calamari coated with a sweet chili sauce and lobster Mac and cheese that wasn't memorable.   I hope they get it together because they have a great spot in South End and seem very eager to please.   
My humble opinion is don't dumb it down!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't pay much attention to the negative reviews of a place, as we like to form our own opinion but...lesson learned.

Table of 6 was sat pretty quickly after we called and were told in a very valley girl accent that they were \"like......10 deep.\"

Our server was great. I've seen reviews about bad service, but ours was really attentive. 

Great old fashioned drinks there. Highly suggest.

Here's where the yelp reviews are true:

Avocado toast is SUPER lemony. Overpowering to the whole dish.

Lobster Mac and cheese is fettuccini (which is accurately presented on the menu.ot macaroni, which let's be honest...is what we're all looking for. The lobster Mac and cheese at Namastay Kitchen is better. Seriously. 

Biggest charcuterie board only comes with 5 tiny pancakes to use with the cheese. We had to ask for extra. 

And speaking of the charcuterie board, I've seen complaints about things on their website menu being a different price when you get to the restaurant. This is absolutely true. The full blown charcuterie board online was $36, and when we got there it was $50. $50 FOR A CHARCUTERIE BOARD? I'm sorry...I'm not sure you got that. It was $50! I'd love those margins if I were Zeppelin. 

My advice is go grab a drink and a snack, and leave. Immediately."}
{"text":"Nice place with a variety of small plates. The wagyu beef was delicious but the other small plates we had were just ok. Not a great selection of drinks. Atmosphere was ok"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good service, amazing food, delicious drinks. Prices a little high but worth it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Cheese plate was a joke. \"Small\" plates were so unsatisfying. Very disappointed. Service was okay and hostess was accommodating but the food made it a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Ideally, I would give this place 3.5 stars. The menu is filled with unique dishes such as butternut squash hummus, coal roasted cabbage and lobster avocado toast and has a strong focus on locally sourced ingredients. However, there's a certain \"je ne sais quois\" that is lacking. The \"smalls\" dishes are in the price range of $8-20 and are meant for sharing. My table ordered the following:

- Peppadew rellenos ($9)- tasty but nothing special 
- Charcuterie plate (with all the options- $35)- highly recommend, great assortment of meats (e.g. duck prosciutto) and cheeses
- Maine lobster mac & cheese ($20)- this dish used fettuccine noodles and was trying to be too gourmet- flavors did not go well together - prefer classic mac n' cheese topped with lobster 
- Pacific yellowtail crudo ($16)- four thin slices of tuna (no flavor), paired with bland crispy rice cakes and plated on top of a sriracha type sauce 

I really wanted to love Zeppelin's but some things need to change before I give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to stop into Zeppelin and I wish I had made it sooner. A great list of custom cocktails. I still haven't grabbed food at Zeppelin but it looked great. I'll check back in after I've tried the food!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and to try all the food. Unfortunately I was unable to try a drink because I left my ID at home (I know, I know) and they carded - so good on them!

We ordered a lot of stuff:

Petite Wedge: absolutely delicious
Roasted & Glazed Carrots: My absolute favorite thing of the night and I don't even eat carrots
Main Lobster & Avocado Toast: This was kind of not good to me. It tasted like key limes and was sweet and just not what I expected.
American Wagyu Tartare: My other favorite thing, it was so good and flavorfull
Charcuterie: Delicious!

Our waitress was also amazing and extremely knowledgeable. She asked for feedback at the end and accepted it with grace. I definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"In short, our experience was...confusing. They use the NoWait app (which should really be the Now Wait app) that told us the wait at 6:15pm was 120-180 minutes. So I used the app to \"get in line\" and walked in to make sure we were in fact, in line. To my surprise the parking lot was pretty damn empty. Walked inside and it was not packed at all. The hostess asked if we wanted to be seated now, which is just a weird question. Of course I want to be seated now? 

Anyway, we got the table and the service was just okay. The cocktails can be talked up all they want, but they aren't really anything amazing. Their version of an old fashioned is $16 and last I checked this is CLT, not Upper Manhattan. The charcuterie board was mediocre at best. Meat, cheese, and mini pancakes with a microscopic dollop of mustard and 3 slices of homemade pickles. Absolutely not worth $32 (these margins are ridiculous).

The vibe and interior are pretty cool, but aside from that I would say go to Davidson Street Public House or an equivalent, for good food and good drinks at reasonable prices.  3/5...decent craft cocktails, interesting food menu, but unnecessarily expensive. Also, some of the more administrative-type kinks need to be worked out."}
{"text":"If you like bacon, this is the place for you!  
I came here on a Wednesday night for a birthday dinner and the place was already somewhat packed by 7:00 when we arrived. They don't take reservations so our group of 5 was seated in a very cozy booth.  It was a bit of a squeeze.
We started off with a number of different cocktails, and all of them were delicious, creative, and unique.  Because it was a birthday celebration, we also decided to try the pickle-backs, which were significantly better than any pickle-back I've ever had! They were served with some sort of globe of pickle juice that's difficult to describe, but yummy.
Onto the food.  We got a charcuterie board and the selection is delicious.  I would have liked more crackers and accompanying pickles, etc., but it was still a good plate.  I did, however, have a difficult time finding other food options since I don't eat bacon or meat.  To be honest, if you're a strict vegetarian, the choices here are extremely limited.  I'm typically able to order food without the bacon or meat but most of the menu has bacon infused into the food which made finding something to eat a true challenge.  I also found the servings to be a bit small for the price.  
We ended our birthday dinner with a desert, which was excellent.  
I should also mention that our waitress was truly outstanding. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu in its entirety and provided excellent service. 
Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Zeppelin but I would not recommend them for someone who doesn't eat meat or simply doesn't eat bacon.  I'd probably come back for the cocktails."}
{"text":"*left speechless* but seriously, make this your next date night spot. Not on the inexpensive side but absolutely worth it.  If you're into gin or vodka, start with the giggle fiz or dilworth dig. Can't go wrong with charcuterie - the Brie and duck prosciutto is to die for. To share, you must try the fried chicken with the mango habanero sauce. My boyfriend and I didn't speak to each other during this course besides a few \"wows\" and \"can you believe this\". If all that wasn't enough, we were convinced to try the cookie dough ice cream. Cookie butter. Amazing. All I can say. Great vibe, great food all in all!"}
{"text":"While the food looked interesting, our party was never seated due to completely sub-par front of the house staff. We were a party of six that arrived at 6 pm fully prepared to wait for a table. Hostess took our name and said about 45 minutes. Fine- we had a decent but overpriced drink at the bar. When we checked back an hour later she said there was a two hour wait- what can you do?  The actual issue was complete lack of table Management such that a six top was never going to became available. Again, that's fine just tell me when I walk in at 6 pm on Saturday that you don't manage to a party of six and I'll go somewhere else. But don't have me waste a prime hour of time and then have 1-2 hour waits at all South End restaurants.  For the prices they want to charge, they need management that actually tries and cares."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best meal I've had in Charlotte.  The cocktails were made with care.  The food was so amazing!  Clearly the chef(s) and/or kitchen staff, was thoughtful in their preparation of my food.  I started with the wagyu tartare, which was absolutely incredible.  Then went onto the calamari, which was lightly breaded with an even sweet to savory ratio, and just a touch of spice... couldn't be happier with the cocktails and the food here.   I will be back!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our experience here was mixed but overall disappointing.  Hopefully and likely due to the fact that it just opened.  First, the restaurant itself is very well designed and has a great ambiance.  It is clear much thought and effort went into design of building menus.  
Overall the service was not good at all.  It was slow and simply not good.  Most were very friendly, just lacked proper training and/or competence.  
The menu was a bit limited due to how new the restaurant is however there were some highlights from what we ate.  The calamari and duck are exceptional.  Will definitely order both again.  
We were caught off guard quite a bit by the attitude of one of the bartenders.  While we respect the fact that he created the drink menu, he was quite condescending and frankly rude.  Not an ideal way to endear yourself and your new restaurant to locals who dine out every weekend.  

I expect that the rough spots from our experience were due to the fact that the restaurant was just opened.  Hopefully they will address the service issues and round out the menu as expected.  

If so, it will be a welcomed addition to the southend dining scene."}
{"text":"The ambience is a hip homage to the era before 1950. The restaurant is in a renovated warehouse.

Staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu.

First small plate was the avocado toast. The avocado smear on the excellent brioche slice was unbelievably good. It was the ultimate avocado.

Second plate was the Wagyu tartare and it was heavenly. The wagyu was a melt in your mouth flavor. This dish is worth a visit if you try nothing else on the menu.

Third up was the nightly pasta special. For us it was a charred scallion pasta in a parmesean small neck clam sauce. The pasta was incredibly delicious and the sauce was potently  delicious.

Then we had the Notorious P.I.G. puppies. The bbq that accompanied the hush puppies was succulent and flavorful. The whipper honey butter was a good pairing to the hush puppies. The hush puppies were a smidge dry unfortunately. 

For dessert we had the chocolate stout cake. The cake was very rich and had great flavor but was slightly dry. The Biscoff ice cream was amazing.

Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Very good small plates. Great cocktail menu. Loved the atmosphere, with Tupac and Beastie Boys setting the mood. Easy parking is a plus."}
{"text":"5 stars for the drinks though a little pricier. Shot with molecular pickle - Something different to try. Food was mediocre or wouldn't recommend. The fish they gave us was full of bones.."}
{"text":"This new Southend spot has great craft cocktails, some with great stories behind them (like the ground botanicals from the local gin being blow torch seared into your glass with great fanfare). If you like an old fashioned try the delicious and smoky Edison. 

We hung out at the bar and had drinks and apps. Calamari was great. Crispy and served with a delightful Asian sweet pepper drizzle. Charcuterie board was good but not great."}
{"text":"Really digging this spot. The first time, I went in the evening after the sun had gone down. The ambiance and vibe was pretty chill. Sitting at the bar felt very lounge-y which is the kick I've been on lately. Yesterday I went because I remembered there was a nice patio out front and I wanted to enjoy the beautiful weather. Although we ended up sitting at the bar the entire time, it was still awesome. The hosting staff is so friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in. A bar staff member approached us and dropped some waters off while we waited for the bartenders to finish up their current tasks. From there we were so impressed. Not only did they answer any questions we had about the menu items, they recommended things and told us about other recipes we hadn't brought up. These guys really knew what they were doing. The entire cocktail making process was such a presentation and show. It was as if these guys were chefs and every detail truly mattered to them. From the way they shook the shakers to how they cut a lemon peel into a perfect rectangle. The cocktail I got was on the lighter side and was made with a melon vodka and topped with egg whites and an edible flower. My boyfriend got the old fashioned. It was presented in a smoke filled cake cover and was nothing short of perfect. If you happen to wonder what the \"Waygu fat washed bourbon\" is, then the bartenders will reply with the following explanation: the restaurant serves a waygu tartare and the extra fat trimmings are set aside to mix with the bourbon. The fat is melted down and added to sit for about an hour and a half. After this, the mixture is frozen for about two hours and when the fat has separated from the liquor, it is skimmed off the top. What is left is a rich taste of waygu beef in a nice brown bourbon. What an awesome technique that truly adds so much to an otherwise typical recipe. 
A friend joined us and ordered dinner which looked awesome as well. I picked one of the two deserts they offer which was the bread pudding garnished with lemon ice cream. Omg! So good. I even got my chocolate loving boyfriend to try it and enjoy it. I got a cold brew coffee to pair with it and wake me up from my food coma. I was honestly just so impressed with the bartender's knowledge and service that I probably wouldn't even have noticed if the rest of the place sucked. Good thing it didn't and all in all this place is a 6 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed two meals here already and really had a great time, but jeez wait times are crazy!

The location is great, nestle right in South End by the design center. There is plenty of street parking and a small lot nearby. The restaurants interior is really cool, but it's pretty small. They have a little bit of outdoor seating. 

The drinks are good and displayed beautifully. I ordered the Fogle Fizz, it was slightly too sweet for me - I'm pretty sensitive to sweet drinks though. My friend ordered the Edison - it has quite the presence! It comes in a smoke filled glass dome that they artfully lift when set at the table.We ordered specialty drink when we went for Valentines day. I can't remember what they were, but they were actually very good.

We've had the roasted and glazed carrots, Maine lobster and avocado toast, Point Judith calamari, Maine lobster mac and cheese, and the buttermilk fried chicken. The standout is by far the carrots!!! They come with a whipped ricotta. As it is with most tapas restaurants, each tapa was between $9-$20 (this is a little steep, but the portions are a little larger than normal). They have larger plates for about $18-$35 (again, they were larger plates, but still a little on the expensive side).

The service was quick. The waiter explained each dish and answered all questions. 

The wait however, was out of control. Using the no wait app barely helps here. We used no wait Valentine's day weekend and waited for almost 2 hours. It was kind of ridiculous. The first time I came here we came at 5:15pm and we had no wait and were seated immediately. 

I suggest you come here for a drink or two and maybe 2-3 tapas and then head out somewhere else for a larger meal!"}
{"text":"This review is solely about my experience attempting to get a drink at Zepplin.

Similar to Stephanie B., I walked in with a friend and was told that they were full, but if we wanted a drink we could \"get one and stand over in the corner - the bar is for people who are eating\". Not the way you want to be greeted when trying to support a new cocktail place in your neighborhood. We felt like a burden instead of being welcomed, and immediately left.

Place seems to have a lot of potential and is somewhere I would love to experience, but should really revisit how they navigate the front of the house. Maybe it will be better once it's warmer and the outside opens up."}
{"text":"Great place. Fresh ingredients, awesome cheese plate, and knowledgeable staff. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A casual restaurant, with a not so casual menu. The service is friendly and very professional. I had the pleasure of having the head bartender, Ryan, to tend to my table. Ryan suggested some cocktails and they were absolutely delicious! Quit dragon my heart and French 75, definitely recommend both. Dragon is smooth and sweet while the French 75 is very citrusy, crisp and refreshing. That said, I think French 75 was my favorite, most drinks topped off with prosecco, are usually good in my book. The menu is meant to be shared but in no way like many other restaurants where they are barely sharable. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartar and the Point Judith Calamari, both dishes were enjoyable. The only thing that threw me off was the Tartare, the togarshi rice crackers flavors compete way too much with the tuna.  I liked the contrast of the compressed melon, cucumber and almost preferred the tartare with the cucumber alone. I am looking forward to returning so that I can try more items! Great job Zeppelin team!"}

{"text":"We've been meaning to try Zeppelin for a while now, and I'm so glad that we were finally able to! Hands down, one of the best food + cocktail experiences that we've had in a while. We consider ourselves foodies and are fortunate that we are able to enjoy the Charlotte food scene regularly; so when I say that our meal at Zeppelin ranks in the Top 5 in all of Charlotte (and surrounding areas), trust me that I don't throw that compliment out lightly!  
We ordered 3 cocktails (the QUIT DRAGON MY HEART and FOGLE FIZZ were our favorites), and a few apps and dessert. The ricotta Gnocchi was AMAZING, and rivaled some of the best gnocchi dishes that we've had in Rome and Venice. The notorious PIG puppies were unexpectedly tasty, and while a little on the heavier side, they offered all the flavors of a great BBQ plate in a more sophisticated way. The tuna tartare was unlike any tartare I've had recently, and you could tell that the quality of the ingredients was top notch.
And we purposely saved room so that we could order the Krispy Kreme bread pudding...and holy mother, was it worth it!!!  I seriously wish I had a second stomach so I could've shoved the whole thing in my mouth.
Also to be noted, my husband basically wanted to move into this place because the music they were playing was insane (think 90's rap, mixed with some of your favorite college era club jams). The whole vibe was cool and hip, without giving the impression that they were trying too hard. Furthermore, the staff was awesome and you could tell that they were all genuinely invested in the whole concept and experience --- our waitress was just fantastic, and as nice as they come. 
If you're planning on going to grab a bite anytime soon, or just want the perfect place to enjoy some mind blowing cocktails and apps, look no further than this great Southend spot."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of the place, very intriguing decor and steampunk themed. The bartenders wore denim uniforms, and practiced drink making like a craft. The drink menu was very well thought out with all the different eras of classic cocktails. Wine list was certainly enjoyable as well. Only thing was the repeat of the top 40's over the last 25 years playing overhead very loudly."}
{"text":"The decor was great! Nice cozy feel. It not a big venue but they do have an outdoor patio. I did try one of there craft drink, Ferdinand Friend. The drink was very strong which is a plus but small in size. I prefer the Calamari which had a great flavor. Great portion size as well for it to be a small plate. Overall like the experience."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The charac board, already $30, comes with 4 pieces of PANCAKE. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME, PANCAKE. When I asked for sub of bread, the very rude, very hipster bar tender told me that would be another $4. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME, ANOTHER $4!

Dont waste your time or money on this pretentious bull shit place, there's great food next door."}
{"text":"Pre concert meal before hitting up K.Flay at the Music Factory. Got here a little early on Friday Night and were seated quickly and it did fill up. Really cool craft cocktail options. The Edison was tasty. Served under smoke filled glass.

4 of us shared 5 small plates and it was plenty. Everything was good. Loved the citrus lobster avocado toast. The calamari with sweet chili oil was the perfect last dish. Almost liked dessert. 

Service was excellent. Everyone knew the menu and the details and you will want the details because you will forget all the info and not realize where all the flavors are coming from."}
{"text":"Tried the waitlist app on Yelp and was told to wait an hour.  Showed up an hour later and they told us it would be a 30 minute wait.  So, naturally we went to Leroy Fox's down the street."}
{"text":"I have to be honest...this place just isn't quite there yet.  

everything felt fussy, like they were trying to hard to be something special without actual substance.

when drinks are in the $13-17 range, I want to actually taste what I'm getting. instead the foggle fizz, and zepplins play on an old fashioned (rec by our server) tasted plain and watered down.

we ordered the charc board- we got the incorrect kind of cheese the first time around. not to mention everything was sliced so thin that it was hard to taste.

next we ordered the waygu tartare (the best thing we had all night), the the avo toast. which was weird. while the lobster was perfectly cooked, the bread tasted like pound cake and the mousse was so lemony it tasted bitter.

we opted for another round of drinks- but incurred the same problems as the first round and an order of the pork buns.

these buns took 25 minutes to come out. they were good...but salty.

2.5 hours and $150 dollars later, I probs will spend my money elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to Zeppelin a couple of times and have always had a great time here. The drinks are amazing. I love that they take their time to create such great drinks. I love Old fashions and they have a special one called the Uncle Eddy that I highly recommend. It has a strong ginger flavor but you can still feel the bourbon in it. I love that they serve it with king cube and cold smoke that gives it a personal touch. 

I still haven't been able to try the full menu, but the food for thought, if your going for late night tapas and drinks are a must. There are like 5 or 6 items and we ordered all of them and they were all presented spectacular and so yummy. 

I would recommend for you to try the notorious pig puppies and the lamb rumba. These two are a must. My mouth is watering just by writing this. 

I had seen on Instagram they did a cocktail with a Z for zeppelin on it, but they don't do it anymore. I hope one day when I'm back I will be able to try that cocktail since it looks so appealing to me. 

Go check out zeppelin you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Wednesday night and had a good experience! The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cool it is kind of industrial rustic. They had a large list of cocktails and only one page of food. Everything we had was very good. This would be a great place to get drinks and a few plates to share with friends. It is a little bit pricey for dinner. Service was good."}
{"text":"A girls night out at Zeppelin, a little pricey compared to other restaurants that serve small plates. This place was well rounded, and the mini pancakes were a hit with the meat and cheese boars, although we had to order alot extra for 8 people. I am not sure this place will survive in the location it is at unfortunately. The outdoor patio and firepit space is cute for afternoon/evening drinks."}
{"text":"Holy Efffffff this is the magical dining experience Charlotte has been missing. Food this amazing is typically more native to destination type cities. I would try to list out some of the more especially amazing menu items but I can't, everything from the service to cocktails to small plates to the AMAZING dessert is simply exquisite. Go here. Eat, drink and be Merry. The chef has truly created an irreplaceable experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the variety of the small plates menu. Some missed the mark like the avocado toast. However, everything was seasonally fresh, great drinks, and attentive service."}
{"text":"I am only rating off of our experience at the bar. We did not eat.

Went in late on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. The place wasn't very full. The first thing we noticed was how loud it was. They play the music loudly and even though it wasn't full it felt very loud. We wonder what it sounds like when it is busy. Not the best Ambiance because of this. Doesn't seem to match the look. We kept saying they needed to add some panels to help absorb the sound. I do like the look of the restaurant, however.

We sat at the bar and didn't have the best experience. We didn't even get greeted when we sat at the bar and the bartender was only a step or two from us. It was not busy and there were three bartenders. We simply had a menu slid towards us. Once the bartender did take our order, he did not ask us if we had any questions or help explain the drinks. He walked over and simply looked at us. It honestly felt like we were bothering him. 

I ordered a Manhattan and my husband ordered the Edison. I know it's gimmicky, but I love the taste of smoky drinks. The presentation of the Edison is beautiful. The Manhattan was solid and small. The Edison was good, but was not near as great as I wanted it to be. I have had better smoky drinks in town. 

My last concern with this place is the prices. Not all of us are on a banker's salary. The Manhattan was $15! Not even a specialty version. The Edison was $16. Ouch ouch ouch. If things are going to cost this much they have to be great, and these were just not worth it and neither was the experience. I recently had a bartender make me a custom smoked version of an old fashioned from scratch for $10, so this feels absurd.

We live within walking distance of this place, so I was very disappointed. I will likely not return. I understand they are a restaurant and not a bar, but I'm hesitant to return and try the food because of the above experience. A kind, engaged bartender would've likely changed our entire experience."}
{"text":"A nice little place in the South End!  It's a bit small and the drinks are pretty pricey, but The Edison, their take on an Old Fashioned, was a hit.  The small plates were also tasty and eclectic.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped here one Sunday evening with a girlfriend for drinks and to catch up. She ordered a Mule, and I ordered the Dilworth Dig. We continued with those drinks for 2 more rounds lol. Needless to say they were good. If you have a wide palate for alcohol, you will definitely find what you're looking for here. We grabbed calamari and avocado toast to much on. The avocado toast was very pretty yet the bread was a little sweet for my liking. However, between the bread, lobster, and avocado spread, you will experience a lot of flavor. The calamari stole the show. You must try! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing only the bar experience and not the food or the restaurant experience.

Went here with a party of nine to get a round of drinks. When I asked for a lemon drop martini the bartender looked like he was contemplating whether he was going to make it for me or not. After a few seconds of that he nodded his head that he would make that for me. When the drink came out I was shocked to see that the glass was only half full! I took it thinking maybe this was just how they do it, but all of my friend's drinks that were of a similar nature were filled to the top of the glass. And the drink wasn't cheap either, around what you would pay in a NYC bar. The drink tasted fine, but many of my friends did not like their drinks at all.

The service staff seemed irritated altogether. One of the service members told a girl in my party to not touch the antique phone that was on the hostess stand. I mean I get it, it's old and could break, but it's a bar with drunk people... what do you expect. Maybe put it somewhere else.

A girl in the party was also seriously overcharged for a glass of preseco. She noticed and they did refund her, but still it was a pretty big mistake to make."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Zeppelin.  Got there early on a Friday night with a party of 6. No wait. Was quickly seated.  Server was very nice and informative. We ordered our drinks, which were delicious.  The menu is small and most dishes are served tapas style and serve 2-3 people each. We ordered a total of about 4 small plates and 3 big plates and a dessert which I was too full to try.  
The notorious P.I.G and calamari were delicious!  The lamb ribs were tender and perfectly seasoned.  The fried green tomatoes and burrata were surprisingly refreshing and equally good. I wasn't too fond of the waygu beef tartare. Although the presentation and favors were on point, the way the meat was presented, visually, turned me off. I was expecting finely chopped beef but my plate had ground raw beef on it like it just came out of a meat grinder.  And the truffle yolk was not aesthetically pleasing to me. But I have to admit, eyes closed, the flavors were good. The beef was very well seasoned and the components of the dish worked well with the beef.  
I especially liked that with each dish that came out of the kitchen the server gave a tantalizing description of each dish. I felt like I was at top chef!  All in all it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"$16 for a tiny drink - that was not good - and the server forgot the fried chicken order...which was the only large/main order two of us had (3 others were the small ones). Disappointed in the food and service was not good, but could have been too high expectations because of the hype."}
{"text":"I went into Zepplin with two of my girlfriends not really knowing what to expect. I was hoping it would not be a pretentious cocktail bar with mediocre food like some of the other new places popping up in Charlotte. It certainly was not any of that, Zepplin is tiny little gem in Southend. Awesome patio and very comfortable restaurant inside with cool decor. Not very big so I could see coming here on the weekends being a challenge, I'd try to make a reservation if they take them. We went on a Monday and it was still pretty busy.... all for good obvious reasons! The cocktails are interesting and delicious. If you like gin, try the giggle water. It was very refreshing and was not to sweet or spicy. Service was top notch! Our server was fantastic and very attentive. The food menu has many great offerings whether you are in the mood for tapas style or entrees. We decided to share a couple dishes between the three of which was perfect. The butternut squash hummus is amazing, seriously delicious and served with honey, olive oil, squash, and pesto. This combination of what sounds random was absolutely fantastic! All served w freshly toasted bread. The lobster Mac and cheese was on point, it was creamy and served with linguini. I really enjoyed how it was a good balance of cheese and a light cream sauce, wasn't heavy at all.  Check this place out! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! 

I feel like I may have raved about this place too much, but praise where praise is due. 

The menu is chef driven and always changing, curated by one of the most passionate chefs in Charlotte, Vince Giancarlo.  

The bar is mesmerizing, I especially love the silent movies they play on the TVs, it really keeps the environment classy and interesting and the cocktails are innovative and unique.

Their bar is endless, the most cordials and mixers I have ever seen in one place. The bartenders Ryan and Shane made me all sorts of interesting cocktails and every one of them was excellent. 

Being a bartender myself, I appreciate the craft and the technique that goes into every cocktail and Zeppelin prides themselves in following through with those expectations. 

All in all, this is one of my new favorite places to hang out and will keep coming back for more !"}
{"text":"Just opened in the Southend!  It was a wonderful dining experience.  Arrived at 5:45 pm and was already full.  Waited about 15 minutes for a table.  The Vesper martini was delicious!  They have a great cocktail list, my friend ordered the gin & tonic and said it was the best he ever had.  We ordered small plates and they all were delicious.  The fried chicken was the best I have ever had!  The only reason for a 4 versus 5 star is the service was a little slow, not attentive enough -- probably need more staff and the lobster Mac and cheese was more like a pasta dish with cheese on top, delicious but not a traditional lobster Mac and cheese.  The atmosphere is small, elegant and lively!"}
