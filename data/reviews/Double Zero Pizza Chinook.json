{"text":"Beautifully decorated - you forget you are in a mall.    Service - fantastic.  Our server came around but not too often.    Food - delicious.  The pizza was cooked perfectly and was almost as good as the company I was with.    Drinks - I ordered a random glass of presecco and it did not disappoint.   Bill - value for money.  Two pizzas, two bottles of water, a glass of beer and a glass of wine with 15% gratuity - $65.   A new favourite close to home."}
{"text":"We finally have an open restaurant in the huge space at the end of the new\"ish\" wing in Chinook Centre.  Double Zero Pizza - Chinook from brothers Jon & Chris Molyneux and Concorde Entertainment Group opened on April 1st, 2014. - No joking.  The lower lounge level will open soon but the upper restaurant is ready to serve customers.  Moments after they opened for business the restaurant began to fill with shoppers, business people, family and friends.  The two levels are bright and airy with a high ceiling.  Caramel coloured banquettes fill the space along with cool and comfortable fabric covered chairs.  Favorite décor choices are the larger than life black and white photographs which are rumored to be of family and friends of the restaurant.  You may very likely run into one of the models while dining.  The young, enthusiastic servers are beaming and eager to make you feel welcome.  There are the usual glitches of newbies to the industry bringing food to the wrong table but who cares in this light hearted atmosphere?  A large space creates some noise but the bustle is welcoming and fun.  Pizza is the star of the menu and is served in the Neapolitan thin crust style.  You can add grated parmaesan, chili flakes, or chili oil if you wish but the carefully selected toppings are tasty and I trust Chef Justin Leboe.  I am a fan of their two choices of Pizza Bianco.  (That's a pizza without tomato sauce.  - A true test of a great pizza crust.)  Both the Chicken Confit and the Mushroom selections are satisfying.  A pizza is between $14 to $19 and is so good you won't be able to save any for lunch tomorrow.   So take the LRT or park your car underground at Chinook Centre.  After shopping wear your new outfit to Double Zero Pizza for lunch or dinner.  Very cool and very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm more of the traditionalist pizza fan; thick crust and the usual Hawaiian or Vegetarian toppings.   We tried Double-Zero at Chinook for something new and were satisfied with the food but impressed by the service.  The 4 of us settled for a calamari appetizer, 3 thin crust pizzas and the chocolate torta for the desert.  The calamari was good and not chewy.  We tried the Polynesian Princess, Chorizo Salami and Vegetable with tomato sauce and goat cheese as our pizza selections.  The thin crust was a little too thin to hold the light toppings.  The chorizo salami was on the salty side with the PP and Vegetable as our recommendations.  The chocolate torta was ok but nothing to rave about.   Our server was excellent in providing great table service and his recommendations.  I would rate the food as 3.0 stars and the service as 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'll give it to Double Zero for finding a prime place to open their second location. Atmosphere was nice. Good place for casual dining and for groups. Very energetic.  Waitstaff were attentive however the awkward table arrangements had them coming from either side of you reaching across the table instead of walking around.  Food however would not go back for. I ordered the Mortadella pizza and I must say for $19 you do not get what you've paid for. Toppings were minimal and flavor was lacking.  The place is all hype and not worth going more than once.  Save yourself the long wait and go to Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria where you get a larger pizza with better flavor and for way better value."}
{"text":"It was OK ... it's a restaurant in a mall, so that kind of sets the tone.  The food was pretty good.  Pizza has a nice thin and crispy crust.  The cauliflower appetizer was quite good and a big portion.  The arancini was average at best.  Pizzas were larger than expected.  Prices were a bit high, but serving sizes were large. I asked our server for a glass of water twice and he never did bring one.  Definitely not a fine dining experience, but OK for a quick bite.  I would probably eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is probably an upscale treat for suburbanites who are used to Dominos or Pizza Hut. For those of us who frequent places like Una, Bensonhurst, and WOP - or anyone who has travelled Europe - this restaurant will disappoint. The pizzas are decent-ish, the service was good. However, the desserts were pretty bad (pannacotta was unset - more like a bowl of yogurt, and the tart pastry tasted store-bought) and the olives were pretty much poured out of a can, and then microwaved hot (???)  awful.  It's okay for mall food, but at these prices, you've got way better options for pizza in Calgary."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good, but I was even more taken with the meatballs and the calamari. The calamari is lightly breaded and the sauce it comes with is perfect, a nice switch up from the typical tzaziki"}
{"text":"Beef Pepperoni Pizza! So delicous all the ingredients tasted fresh and from scratch  Service was good great modern ambience. Defenitly recommend this spot and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to stop for a meal, but asked my husband to pick-up some dessert. We had the Cannoli. It was really good! It was difficult for me to compare because it has been many years since I've ordered Cannoli."}
{"text":"Food was decent enough, though overpriced.  18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill ( we had a party of 8), then the server was annoyed that we actually wanted change for our cash.  Overall my first impression is: loud, unfriendly service, and overpriced. Will not go back again.  At least not when there are so many other, better restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered the Polynesian princess and it left a lot to be desired. Edges burnt & center was was raw. The waitress was very friendly but at no point was a table check conducted despite the fact that we only ate one bite of our pizza in the 15 minutes it sat in front of us & then had it boxed up.   It's hard to have an error corrected when noone asks if everything is ok. This is my second time at Double Zero and my second disappointment- I really wanted to give it another chance! Una & Without Papers do this concept & style of pizza so well in comparison.   Nice atmosphere but if the food is continually a disappointment there's really no reason to go back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Double Zero for quite some time. So when my friend suggested eating there before our movie, I was all for it. It wasn't very busy when we went, so service was decent.   My friend got the Polynesian Princess. The pineapple on pizza debate has been red hot as of late and I found this pizza actually had very little pineapple on it. So the Gordon Ramsays of the world might be alright with it. I was disappointed though. Pineapple is one of the main toppings and it had maybe a few thin slices on it. Pretty underwhelming. I got the Chorizo Salami. This one was a little better. The toppings were generous and I liked the flavour way more.  I agree with other reviewers that the restaurant itself is really beautiful. Whoever designed the space did a great job. I think I need to try more things on the menu before I can make a final consensus. But I will say the Chorizo Salami is worth ordering, the Polynesian Princess not so much."}
{"text":"I came in the entrance from Chinook Mall, stepped thru the door and loved the atmosphere. There is a long hallway down to the hostess booth. Gold, black, and white being the theme colors. The bottom floor of the restaurant is more a lunch café style. We chose to eat upstairs where there are lots of windows with great views, a busy pizza kitchen to keep you entertained, and the setting is more a restaurant/lounge style. I came to Double Zero with 4 of my friends, all guys. My one friend had been there before but it was new for the rest of us. I ordered a sprite with fresh limes for my drink. It rated delicious but came in a very small cup that the waitress had trouble keeping full. We each ordered a pizza for ourselves. The pizzas were easily large enough for one person, I definitely got full. To sum it up, the decor is amazing! I would pretty much go just for the atmosphere. The food is good, nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't outstanding for me. The service was lacking, but that can totally change from time to time, my next visit will hopefully be more fulfilling."}
{"text":"Go if you like CHEESELESS PIZZA.   I was so disappointed with the pizza and service here :( I asked for extra cheese on my pizza and it came back with literally NO cheese, I'm not even exaggerating. The other pizza with extra cheese that I ordered had the smallest sprinkle ever. Literally, an over baked pizza from Superstore would have been better than this. The waitress was nice enough, but refused to come to the table as soon as the food was brought out. When we told her about the cheese, she spoke to the manager and came back with a small container of parmesan cheese explaining that their pizzas don't come with much cheese to begin with and they don't put the cheese on evenly throughout the pizza so we were forced to eat the pizzas we had cold at this point because this whole back and forth took so long. Not only was cheese non existent but the toppings were extremely scarce- two shavings of meatball on the one with maybe three pieces of green onion. I was hungry coming out, since we pretty much ate bread. Double Zero, don't cut your costs on quality."}
{"text":"Came for a date with my wife and our baby girl. The food was delicious and the service was good. However when I needed to change my baby's diaper I had to do it on the floor of the bathroom because there was no change table or countertop space in the bathroom."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping it hit the spot.  They have a cool menu. They also have a great local beer variety.  No big beer companies here which I'm ok with."}
{"text":"I've never been to the other location but I've heard good things so I was excited when this location opened up.  This place will definitely be a regular stop.  The staff is very friendly and even though it was busy you don't have to wait long for a table.  I came here with my mother when she was in town.  We started off with the Arancini.  We both loved it and fought over the last one.  My mom won...grrr.  We then split the Sausage pizza which also had artichokes on it.  It was very good.  You also got this spicy oil stuff to put on your pizza.  Normally I shy away from adding hot sauce to my food because I like to actually taste the food rather than taste the burning.  This stuff was the exception.  Its the perfect level of spiciness and it really enhance the flavors of the pizza rather than overpowering them."}
{"text":"I must be super behind the times, because I've never been to either Double Zero location before. After my visit to the Chinook location, I'm a fan and I'm looking forward to checking out the downtown location - I'm told it's quite different!  Double Zero is down in the \"new\" (higher-end) section of Chinook Mall and is a bright and charming two level restaurant. My boyfriend and I dropped in, exhausted, at about 7:30 pm after searching for our Underwear Affair costumes... and we were out of there by about 8:10! Wow! How's that for speedy service?  We had a fairly private table on the second level, near the staircase, which suited us perfectly. I think if it were a nicer day or we were more energetic, it would have been nice to sit by the massive windows and watch the traffic on Macleod Trail but there was no way we would have appreciated it in our states that night. We had the Aracini as an appetizer and then shared the Sausage pizza - both are highly recommended.   Chinook is 5 minutes from my house and it is lovely to have more dining options there. I'll definitely add Double Zero into my rotation... I just may need to start wearing blinders when I walk past the Tory Burch next door so I don't go broke in the process!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I adore Neapolitan pies & I've heard rave reviews of their downtown location. The restaurant itself is very trendy and chic, located on two floors above the entrance to the parkade via MacLeod Trail. Awesome concept, high ceilings, large portraits adorning the walls and plenty of comfortable booth seating.  My table and I were seated quickly in the restaurant upstairs with a great view of the open kitchen and the entire dining room. . I ordered the \"Speck\" pizza: Arugula, Prosciutto and mozza. Although tasty & fresh in the center, the entire crust was burnt and inedible. Major bummer as the Neapolitan crust is always the best part!  The service was very cheery and eager.. The staff are young, cute and bubbly. Our sever was very friendly and checked on our table regularly. No complaints there.  All in all, I realize that new restaurants require a little while to iron out all the kinks and Double Zero-Chinook will be no different. I'll return to try out a few more of their pizzas eventually, in the future.  3-star rating"}
{"text":"As I'm writing this review, this is my 3rd visit, and I am still loving it. The pizzas are their main forte for visiting (obviously..lol) is amazing, thin crust, tastes freshly made. I highly recommend ordering Polynesian princess (see mah pictures) as it resembles me of Hawaiian pizzas, but more upscale? If you get what I mean? My second recommendation would be for the cheese lovers, the Formaggio Finale, it is so tasty, gooey with sweetness into it.  As for the pasta section, I recommend the linguine vongole. The taste is just right, and the double smoked bacon sold me.  As for appetizers, I always go for calamari, the portion size is big and it has unique ingredients that I've never seen yet, like capers (sour and a bit salty, like olives but milder for me).  I would have to come back again just for desert as I end up being full before I take a look at the desert menu.  Overall, the atmosphere is definitely my type as it has a contemporary look with fusions of vintage items from the days of yore. I need to come back again when I crave for pizza once again."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I have been craving pepperoni pizza for a while now, and after hitting up another pizza spot a few days earlier and not getting my fix I decided to try this spot.  The beer selection was decent and the pizza choices were nice and varied.  Thin crust, open oven cooked in a short time while you wait.  I say plenty of people drinking wine too so that's a nice touch.  The location is good near the end of the mall and overlooks the road...which is not much of a view, but that's okay.  I got a pepperoni pizza, hoping this would allow me to move on from my two week desire for a regular pepperoni pizza....no luck.  The pizza was pretty good, don't get me wrong, but the sauce was more of a white/red combo than an all red marinara sauce, and the pepperoni was all fancy and not greasy and the pizza was too thin and lacked that depth of crust I was looking for.  It did not taste bad and the servers were polite, but from the perspective of coming in craving a pizza, I left wishing I had a normal pizza instead of what I got.  As far as thin crust pizzas, and beer combos go, this place was okay. Though I prefer Beer Revolution."}
{"text":"Best crust! My favourite is the Polynesian princess, make sure to add some of the oil with chilies onto your pizza- delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been longing to try Double Zero for many moons and was excited to check out the new location that opened up in Chinook.  First off, Bravo DZ on your new space and design! From main floor to second it is wonderfully bright and has quite a designer feel to it...to me it almost feels like you are in a Italian shoe store... but you are there to eat! WIN!    I made a reservation for us on a Wednesday about 30 mins out and was pleased on how organized the staff was. When we were shown to our table I really couldn't help just looking around and taking it all in, the large portraits are really eye catching.   Service is good and I enjoyed the laid back nature. We ordered arancini and the marinated local beets to start - they were both full of flavour and quite tasty. I would definitely get both again. I cannot say the same about the pizza we chose however... It was really quite disappointing. We ordered the 'Polynesian Princess' and it left so much to be desired! I felt like it was ho-hum and nothing special.   With this being said I will still come back and try a couple more different pizzas on their patio - it looks super fun!"}
{"text":"I was at double zero last night for dinner. The sevice was rushed and not at all friendly.  The food was horrible.  We had a ceaser salad and margarita pizza, I can say with all honesty that a bagged salad and frozen pizza would have been better. With so many pizza options in Calgary, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"3 ppl ordered 2 starters as calamari, 00 meatballs(3 balls to be exact). 2 pizzas as for Formaggio finale( sweet cheeses) and wagyu pepperoni( beef). It tastes good. And the service is really fast. I like the thin crust of pizza. But the pizza need to have a little bit of more spice and veggies. It's can be a little too greasy..."}
{"text":"The best place I've been to for pizza in Calgary. The pizzas are all \"neoplatin thin crust\" which is a perfect compromise between the super thin crusts where you eat a whole  pizza and want seconds and the regular crust where you finish a couple of pieces and hate yourself for eating so much. Basically, the pizzas are perfect size for two! We tried the Formaggio Finale, and it was delicious. Cheesy goodness with a honey to tie the flavors together. You can make it taste even better with their spicy pizza sauce. It adds a subtle kick to the pizza to make it even more mouth watering. And if you're looking for some good meatballs, you gotta try them here. Juicy with marinara sauce. The roasted cauliflower is amazing too. Full of healthy pieces, a satisfying crunch, and a bit of sweetness that made us order seconds.   The downstairs has a really relaxed atmosphere and a friendly waitstaff. They'll make sure you have everything you need and then some. A great spot to get away from the busy mall and enjoy some comfort food."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. Meatball are awesome. Caesar salad very enjoyable. I had the pepperoni pizza and although tasty the crust was very soggy. Atmosphere is pleasant but noisy."}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good, nothing I'm dying to try again but it was a decent meal. The one thing I was very turned off by was the condition of the bathroom. We sat upstairs and I was very surprised that there was only one bathroom (one for men & one for ladies obviously). Clearly the bathroom had not been attended to all day. There was garbage all over the floor and both garbage bins were over flowing. The soap dispenser on the wall was broken (which is ridiculous as they just opened) so they replaced it with a soap container.. which is fine but it was empty! There's nothing worse than having no soap in the bathroom --especially at a restaurant when I am about to eat! The hall way waiting area for the bathroom is over-crowded with chairs, which when one person leaves the bathroom, you awkwardly have to shuffle passed each other to get by. Over all the experience was \"Meh\" I don't know if I'd be excited about returning."}
{"text":"Better than I expected- a couple of my coworkers said this place was great so we decided to check it out. Very loud inside but the food was incredible. We didn't know what was good but the meatballs were our appetizer and they were absolutely unreal. Seriously get them. We ordered the Polynesian and margherita pizzas and both loved them. No oil or grease layer on top- definitely made you feel good about eating a whole pizza to yourself! I'll be back next week"}
{"text":"I am a pretty big fan of Double Zero for a couple of reasons. Generous portions on appetizers and salads for a good price. Quick efficient service, where all the servers seem to help each other out. Amazing happy hour deals, and really great flavour and quality. Oh and they take reservations which is great when the mall is busy.  This time around went for lunch with colleges. Thankfully I work on a team where everyone wants to try everything, so we shared a bunch of things.  Tried all of the following:   - calamari: light slightly spicy sauce and a massive portion. Also not too chewy. - '00' meatballs: tasty and not too fatty, comes with great bread to soak up that delicious tomatoe sauce - warm brussels sprouts: enough speck lardon to make it a little salty but not too fatty - mushroom crosta: the star of the show, and will eat that again in a heart beat. Wanted to drink the left over sauce - sausage pizza: good kick to the sausage and generously portioned across the pizza - mushroom pizza added double smoked bacon: after the mushroom crosta this was less flavourful but still ok. Felt like it needed some salt or more flavour somewhere.  For dessert we tried their chocolate torta which is incredibly rich and too sweet for me. Also tried the fresh Italian donuts which were about double the size of mini donuts and 3x as tasty. For coffees we had a couple of lattes and they were incredibly large! You will have got your cafine fix without a problem.Great way to finish the meal.  They have a happy hour $5 menu from 3-5pm daily with some great options as well as doing a free pizza with any bottle of wine ordered after 9pm. Not sure what pizza but will definitely be finding out on future visits!"}
{"text":"Being in Chinook Mall on a weeknight, we decided to try Double Zero for a late dinner.  Atmosphere: 4/5  This is a beautiful two story space with a modern and relaxed feel.  We ended up on the second level at a table close to the back of the restaurant.  Nice decor, good ambience, and conveniently located inside Chinook Mall.  Food: 4/5  I ended up ordering something from the grill instead of pizza - the grass fed Alberta flat iron w arugula.  The steak was cooked well to my liking and the sauce was tasty.  Portion size was a little small though.    Price: 3/5  Slightly high for the amount of food  Service: 3.5/5  We were at the back of the restaurant so sometimes it took a little longer to order or have our drinks refilled.  Otherwise friendly service.  Overall: 3.5/5  I really like the modern relaxed atmosphere in this restaurant.  Prices were a little high for the amount of food for what I ordered, but I would definitely like to try one of their pizzas."}
{"text":"We had the Polynesian Princess pizza on the gluten free crust. It was extremely bland, and the ham tasted like cold deli meat. Very unappetizing pizza, everything was falling off of it, it seemed like it was hardly cooked. I will never get pizza here again. I was definitely unimpressed."}
{"text":"Service was good, the roasted cauliflower was good....but the reason for coming was the pizza and the crust was soggy...we went with another couple and they had a different pizza and it was soggy as well."}
{"text":"Great place! I like how spacious it is that even when it's crowded you wont hear people from the other table talking. Love their pizza and drinks!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd rate Double Zero 3.5 stars. The crust is good but nothing super special. Perhaps they think it great, as they are selling their own flour mix throughout the establishment. The pizza ingredients were measured but well-matched and tasty, and the salad was nutritious without sacrificing flavour for it.  We likely won't return when the price was not worth the meal. Ah well, in the upscale end of the mall, I guess one would pay a premium. After all, if want to be seen by others there, by all means..."}
{"text":"What's not to like?!  Great bright space attentive friendly service. Happy hour red was very nice $5 appetizers."}
{"text":"Went here after watching Spiderman 2, service was relatively quick and server was friendly enough--- pizza was meh-- We ordered the Mortadella Pizza but unfortunately it was relatively flavourless, we could barely taste the tomato sauce or the basil or the pistachio, the  only saving grace was the mortadella meat itself.   Famoso, Una and Without Papers is still way more delicious... Sorry but going to have to say pass."}
{"text":"Double Zero does this pretentious thing where they named their restaurant after a high-end ingredient and have a massive hallway with BAGS of it lined up in their shelves.ONLY TO MAKE IT UNAVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY.  Seriously, it's not like Double Zero has landed themselves crates of truffles and are monopolizing Calgary. I could go to a few Italian supermarkets instead, but they're n the other city of the city. You didn't make me want to come to your restaurant to eat your pizza more with this approach, rather you provided me a conversation piece for when I have my pretentious pizza dinner party!  What's next? opening up a place and calling it San Marzanos and cockblocking any avid homecook that asks to buy a can?"}
{"text":"Food Coma. My first time to Double Zero and what can I say, amazing! The service was great, seated instantly, and our waiter had an answer or suggestion for every question we had. Caesar salad, spaghetti and meatballs, and the steak were on our menu for the evening. All of it being delicious.  Its great to have a new option when at the mall, and at the opposite end as well. I will definitely be back for seconds! I also loved being able to park in the underground parkade and take the escalator right to the storefront! No winter chills for this girl!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the downtown location a few times - this was my first visit to the Chinook location. It's quite spacious and it was nice to be able to book a lunch reservation in advance. I had the meatballs and beet salads. Both were delicious and the service was very good.  My only complaint and a big turn-off was that there were fruit flies everywhere :("}
{"text":"I really don't think I'm the kind of guy Double Zero was created for.  I love pizza... but I love it in the very traditional, classic topping assortment, something convenient and familiar to eat with friends over party games or watching a movie or sporting event kind of way. When I start seeing pizzas with ingredients listed that I've never heard of or can't pronounce, and the only usage of the word pepperoni is in quotation marks because such a meat doesn't exist in their establishment, I'm in VERY unfamiliar and uncomfortable territory.  That's not to say the food is BAD - the ingredients were all very fresh, the crust was really unique and nice... on all accounts they definitely seem to know what they're doing. Unfortunately I don't think I \"get it\". I understand that it's a fad lately to want to gourmet up classics - much like how every business these days is trying to reinvent the hamburger with any ingredient they can think of that nobody else is doing, but it's just not really my thing.  The staff were all very nice and friendly, and while I was disappointed that my date and I were stuck sitting at the bar (the place was packed - and most of which being with families which means it was also very loud), being served by an incredibly chatty bartender, it was nice to see how proud he was as he went into far more detail than either of us was very interested in, into where the name of the place came from, which dishes are his personal favorites and why, what kind of equipment they use, etc. etc. It wasn't exactly a great date atmosphere, but if your goal is to go out and try something different, it's definitely  that.  I'm glad I tried it, but when I can get two comparable sized pizzas done more the way I'm familiar with (and prefer) brought right to my house, I can't imagine going out to a place that's seemingly always very busy, with lots of loud kids and large groups, to get less food.  As an experience? Cool, refreshing, unique... if a bit on the loud and obnoxious side.  As pizza? Meh.  But don't take my word for it, lot's of people are really into the \"traditional foods turned on their ear and made gourmet\" kick, and if that's you you'll probably really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went for supper with a large group of 14, service was efficient and quick. Food arrived fast. All the pizzas were very tasty, make sure to add the spicy olive oil and chili flakes. A friend ordered the steak and really enjoyed it, he also mentioned that the happy hour has really good deals.  My friend ordered gelato and gave the waiter a hard time about not having Nutella gelato but he was a very good sport and my friend needs to lower her gelato standards. The waiter said to my friend \"I love your \"world needs to know attitude\".\" Haha so all in all service was great and food was good."}
{"text":"I enjoy a great Napoleon style Pizza and 00 does it right. Meatball starter is delicious. Restaurant is beautiful and the bar is relaxed with great service. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"A huge restaurant in Chinook mall, 2 levels. I've eaten here prob 4 times and every visit was above average. Small simple menu, decent wine list and good pizza. I'm not gluten free but a friend is so I shared a gluten free pizza with her and couldn't tell the difference! There's a pizza with 4 cheeses drizzled with honey that is amaze! It's a nice change from the usual Joeys. Order the meatballs!!"}
{"text":"Made reservation on Yelp. Staff was quick to seat us. Appetizer came out equally as fast. It was a busy Saturday our server could of been overwhelmed forgot a couple things we requested. The food was great though. We were on our way to watch a movie right after dinner, convenient to grab some pizza and walk through the  to the theatre"}
{"text":"Decent service and clean restaurant but my pizza was burnt and served cold.  Had the server said to me \"I wasn't happy with the kitchen's effort\" I would have been impressed, despite being really hungry.  To her, it was good enough."}
{"text":"Overall this was my 3rd visit to this location and it seems to always be busy.   Service is excellent with servers coming back frequently to check on drinks and your food.   Dining area and decor is modern and fresh.   Pizza is why you come and taste wise it doesn't disappoint. Pricing is on the expensive side but this is Calgary after all.   Overall a great place for family and friends to enjoy pizza!"}
{"text":"Anytime I crave good pizza I go to double zero !!! If you're looking for something different, not your typical pepperoni pizza you gotta go there !!! They are always creating new pizzas ! Amazing"}
{"text":"I have taken my family to Double Zero a few times now and we love it, it's been a great experience everytime, the decor is modern, very friendly staff, the portions of food are huge, the Caprese salad is one of my favorites, excellent thin crust pizzas with deelish sauces, the lamb leg is amazing, every dish has been great that we had here, why not a 5 star, well we got there one evening wanting to sit upstairs in dining area, and there were people in the area, but the staff turned us away as they said they were about to close upstairs, well if there are people and staff still around, it's not my place but I know in my business I don't turn away customers if I can help them. It happens. But still will go there, love the food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Reservations are highly recommended during prime times."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at Double Zero but the service has always been spotty. It's a big restaurant and I've never had a problem getting a table. Their menu isn't as extensive as Famoso or Una and I often find myself wanting more choice. The food comes out fast and is usually fresh. The only time we ever complained was when the crust of the mushroom came out super dark, and all you could taste was burnt crust. We sent it back and the manager apologized and took it off our bill. We appreciated the gesture. Double Zero is ok for what they offer but there are other places in town for even better quality pizza and better service. I often hit up Double Zero if I happen to be shopping at Chinook but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Sure helps having a flashy storefront facing Macleod, and finally made the trek through that juggernaut of car lineups going into the mall at this time of year...  And nice that when you come up the escalator, DZP is facing you.  Ordered takeout, fast in 15-20 minutes so that would give me enough time to get something special for me @ Tumi, but I digress.  The bartender said the sausage and their version of Hawaii, but the green onions and artichokes was too hard to resist--plus those veggies would help too.  And boy, was this one of the best I've had in a long time, who knows, just my 3rd meal of the day lol.  Crust wise, i really didn't notice their specialty of 'airiness', and what have you, but can say, this is a repeat to go back to enjoy dining in, it's a place to be seen.  High lofts, an upstairs, and somewhat of a view (you guys don't have water views from these type of restos lol).  Also ordered the cannoli, which I was NOT impressed; not sweet enough, and the shell wasn't the right texture...I get it's not a true Italian bakery...even drizzled in chocolate didn't do it for me....save  your $$$ lol.  Amex good.  Another star for excellent branding with their takeout stickers."}
{"text":"I was at double zero the other weekend. I really enjoyed the space, pizza was amazing, the service was ok. I did notice the kitchen seemed under a lot of tension. The chef with short hair seemed to be stressing every1 out. Not sure if I'll come back when he's working, I felt like it was bad energy being there. I would consider take outs in the future!"}
{"text":"We started with the Calamari which was outstanding.   I loved the pizzas. We had the Polynesian Princess & chorizo. The taste was fabulous.  And the desserts were to die for.   And to make our experience totally awesome we had tremendous service. You should be so lucky to get Sabrina serving you."}
{"text":"They have a big space upstairs, and can accommodate big groups. The service was also pleasant. I like this place, however I enjoyed the food quality in their downtown branch better."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place! It has never disappointed. The same cannot be said for the service. I know it's a very busy location, but even on the slower days the service is lacking. I just don't find the staff very attentive or responsive. It's a shame, too."}
{"text":"There are two Double Zero Pizza places in Calgary. One in downtown and the other in Chinook. Both are awesome. The restaurant is two floors so the bar and dining area is separated. They also have a small patio area. The restaurant is very bright.   We ordered the Polynesian Princess and the Calimari to share. Good size for the pizza. I had them take out the chili flakes off the Polynesian Princess pizza. The pizza was delicious and some what reminded me of an Hawaiian pizza.   The calamari was delicious as well. The restaurant never disappoints. Price is of course more expensive then the other pizza places in Calgary but its not your regular pizza place.  Best part is plenty of parking space available."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place. I'm a huge fan of Una and the whole \"Pizza and Wine\" concept. This place was just really.. lackluster for me. I tried the spinach and potato pizza, sounded great on paper, very bland in my opinion though. You could tell they didn't put a whole lot of care into each ingredient, more just slapped it together and cooked it. Tasted overwhelmingly of bland undercooked potato. I loved the patio and thought the atmosphere of the place was fantastic, my wine was great and my server was friendly and personable. I'd still rather hit Una and get some really stellar pizza for an extra 5-6$ on my bill though."}
{"text":"I am genuinely surprised that this place has gotten good reviews. The only good things about this restaurant is the roasted cauliflower. Oh, and the decor is really nice.  Otherwise it is absolute crap. The service is horrendously slow and our waitress was stunned. It took our waitress so long to take our orders and get our drinks, and almost an hour to get the food.   4 different people asked if we needed our bills split? We said NO multiple times and I guess it just did not compute because they felt the need to continue asking. Literally just listen for 1 minute to what we are saying and you will have an answer to your question. It really bugged me that when I answered \"no we don't need separate bills\" that I was asked a second time, as well as them asking my Dad? Do you not believe me or something?   Our orders got mixed up multiple times. Different servers kept placing other peoples food in front of us. We got the wrong plates at our table. We got no cutlery for half our table and had to track down our server for cutlery. We had to cancel our extra calamari order because our server thought we wanted it at the same time as our pizzas, even though no one said that EVER. We wanted our 4 appys before the pizza, but we only got 3 and then the final one was meant to come with the mains? Like what? Why would you just separate 1 of our appetizers from the appetizer order for no reason? She told us that it was ordered as a main, but when I questioned the table it was just that someone ordered \"Calamari and a Diavola pizza\" and she understood that as us wanting both the dishes at the same time. So it was a misunderstanding, but by that point we had all just shared all the appys and it was unnecessary to have another one come with our main courses. So we basically just had to cancel it because now no one wanted it.  So many miscommunications between our server and our table. It was nuts. Everything can be fixed by listening to your customers. Take a second to process what people are saying, and if you don't understand ask for clarification. Don't just take it upon yourself to make decisions for our table because you know better.   They messed up one of our pizzas but it didn't matter to us, so they bring us out a new pizza anyway? Now our table has 9 pizzas for 8 people, it's like WTF is wrong with you people? If you are going to give us something for free at least ask what we want. They brought us out a second Diavola pizza, and none of us would have wanted it because it tastes horrible. And if there was something wrong with our pizza why even give it to us? And then give us another one 10 minutes later? So now we're stuck with two? Seriously, they can't even give something complimentary properly. Maybe they were trying to be nice and fix a mistake, but by this point we were all kind of fed up with the place that we wanted to get the f%*k out of there.   We did not even bother ordering desert because we actually wanted to leave at some point and who knows how late we would be stuck there if we had desert.   This place is so lucky that they are located in a busy mall and Calgarian people are rich and don't mind spending their money on pretentious restaurants even though the quality of the restaurant is just not up to standard. This place is a prime example of how just because a place looks great doesn't mean it is great.  You people need to shape up. 2/5 stars because your cauliflower saved you. Your CAULIFLOWER is better than your servers."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nice--it is bright and modern.  The service was also good.  But the pizza was not.  The cheese on the pizza that I had was so unevenly distributed that about half the slices had no cheese whatsoever and those that did had very little.  This place is trying to make more upscale Neapolitan-style pizza, so I didn't expect it to be smothered in cheese like Domino's, but there was almost none."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for a dinner date before or after a movie or some shopping in the Chinook mall. The dining room is on the main floor, with a lounge and patio upstairs. Trendy modern art gives the place a very \"now\", atmosphere. The patio behind the bar is very inviting but it was too windy to dine outside during our visit. I thoroughly enjoyed the Arancini balls, with a smokey avocado sauce, I found them to be nice and  light compared to similar dishes elsewhere. Their Caesar salad is a stand-out, dressed with a house-made vinaigrette that has real anchovy and the presentation is pleasantly rustic. My favourite starter / side was the Brussels Sprouts with Italian cured meat. A little charred but not over-cooked, giving a hearty, substantial bite with just the right level of seasoning. My wife has celiac sprue so we ordered both a Gluten Free and a regular crust pizza. Mine was the Wagyu beef pepperoni. The meat was rich but not overly oily, very full-flavoured, a little on the saltier side. I think it pairs very well with an ice cold Peroni. Both of our crusts had a light texture, were not too dense or thick, soft enough to fold a large piece down the middle but with a bit of crisp around the outside. We asked our server if we could purchase some to freeze at home! My only recommendation would be to add toppings if you order the Wagyu beef pizza, it was a little plain. Service staff were knowledgable, friendly and read our energy perfectly. Drinks were refreshed and refilled and plates cleared almost without us knowing. They did not rush us even though other tables were turning over steadily. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of thin napoli style pizza, so I was excited to try this place. My friend ordered the polynesian princess and I ordered the \"pepperoni\". The manager made rounds and suggested we try the chili oil. It was a nice accompaniment to the pizza but I just came back from Portugal so my idea of chili oil is very biased. I enjoyed the flavor combinations of both pizzas, they are above the traditional take out places, but not as good as Without Papers or Una. I have no problem returning if I am in the Chinook Mall area and looking for something simple, tasty, and low key."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping we were quite hungry and needed some tasty pizza!   We ordered the wagyu pizza, sausage pizza, alfredo pasta, and calamari for our appetizer. The wagyu pizza was great, but the sausage pizza was a bit on the soggy side. My hubby took out all the artichokes off  the pizza as they were huge chunks and they were very mushy and didn't really go well with the pizza. The pasta was good as well, but nothing special - probably wouldn't order it again.  Service and atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Will probably come back next time if were in the mall and order their bacon and egg pizza and maybe try some of their white sauce pizzas. But for what they are charging it's tempting to just drive down to 17th avenue and grab UNA Pizza's \"beltline\"."}
{"text":"Love the new menu! Bringing their focus on pizza, in-house made pasta and salads. Service is always great, food is fantastic and drinks are flowing - worth it in every way!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about at this restaurant?  It's a nice looking place, but the pizza is just medeocher.  Toppings are weak, sauce is bland and crusts are pretty much hit and miss.   However; service is something to behold.   I think they should consider making it a training venue for how NOT to treat your paying customers :) The wait staff are so poorly trained and confused it's kinda funny. Except of course the more confused they are the worse your meal is going to turn out, if they even remember to get it to your table. The girls all seem like they are auditioning for a part, but can't get their lines right.  They seem to have forgotten that they are here to make our evenings come together smoothly, not the other way around.  Seems like the customers are a bit of a hindrance to many of the wait staff we met.  Best of luck to the operators."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a month or two after it opened. I knew that there was a downtown location but hadn't been there.  I'm glad I went as this place has the exact kind of pizza that I like. Really thin crust with ingredients that don't overpower everything. It's so nice to find this kind of pizza around here, I'm sick and tired of greek style. As this is a chain there are times where it's not as good but most of the time it's pretty great.   I've only had one time where the staff weren't that great but it was a really busy night. Generally they are attentive and the food comes out very quickly.   Only thing I'd knock them on is that when you order to go they leave the pizza on the counter and not in a warm place; I definitely recommend calling them when you're close by and not far."}
{"text":"My first time ever having double zero pizza (I know)..  I was so pleasantly impressed with the crust and flavour.   It was super dead one weekend at lunch time so I really enjoyed the quiet vibe.   The decor in this location is trendy and gives you some cool items to look at.   The pizza and service is superb, but again I went when it was not busy."}
