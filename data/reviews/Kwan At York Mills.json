{"text":"Went this Saturday for dim sum.    Atmosphere: quiet and clean.  Decor is modern  Food: All day dim sum and during dinner service hours they offer traditional clay pot rice.  Today we ordered typical dim sum food and everything was hot and delicious.   The cheung fung  was particularly good as was the vegetable dumpling.  I like the fact that all the condiments are already on the table so no need to ask.  Even the soy sauce for the cheung fun is already there!  We tried the green tea sesame ball and that was okay.  Price: $3 - Small, 4$ medium, 5$ large, 6$-XL Tea is 2$ pp  Service:  everyone had a smile on their face, and as well they were all attentive and helpful.  This did not feel like your typical Chinese dim sum place which makes the experience much more pleasant.  Overall: definitely a great place for DimSum in North York.  I will be back!--"}
{"text":"Very poor service!!!  even worse than other low-end Chinese restaurants.  Both waiter and waitress are rude.  The waiter didn't apologize at all after he spilled a lot of food crumbs on the customer and the chair.  Food is OK only.  Definitely won't go back!!!"}
{"text":"Consumer beware, overpriced dimsum and Chinese food.  I'm going to be honest, there is absolutely no need to spend extra $ on the exact same food as places like Congee Wong.  The food isn't unique, special or cooked differently, its all one in the same, just smaller portions on a fancy square plate.  Racial remark, chinese restaurants like non-asians because tips are better, lol.  Dimsum, a $3 dish is equivelant to a medium/higher dish at another dimsum restaurant. You can get similar dishes for $1.50 elsewhere.    For those intimidated by the large dimsum restaurants, I would advise to try pushcart places.  Although there may be a language barrier, they will open the lids for you to peak at the food.  Don't worry, ALL the food is clean and fresh!"}
{"text":"The steamed dumplings were waaay over cooked. This place is overpriced in terms of the quality you get and the staff was pretty rude. I'd give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Average food. Clean restaurant. Fast service. Wish server wasn't hovering and staring so much."}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise. I work round the corner and saw this place randomnly. Ive grown up eating dim sum so i always look forward to trying new places.   It was really good. Octopus tentacles were nicely done and not rubbery. The har gao and shu mai were yummy as was the sticky rice. Tea was hot and water cold.  Service was very good. Place has nice modern feel and the noise level is great. Clean and bright. Bathrooms on the same floor. Check the hours before you come. Only open a few evenings."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars  Parking: This plaza is packed and it took me several turns and spins around the parking lot to find a spot. If you come at a busy time, expect to have difficulty finding parking.   Service: Excellent for dim sum. The staff were prompt, brought me two chilli oils when I asked for one and even changed our plates midway through the meal! Ambience was lovely. It was well renovated and not very noisy like you might expect at most dim sum places.   Food: Dim sum quality was not the best I ever had, but still quite good. My highlights were the shrimp rolls and shrimp \"har gow\", as they had very soft and fresh skin wraps. All the food came hot and fresh and stayed hot even after sitting on the table for 10 or more minutes!  Impression: I usually have dim sum in Markham or Scarborough so I was a bit skeptical going out of my comfort area with this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. Price was a bit more expensive than usual, but for the service and fresh food I think it's reasonable. I would come back :)"}
{"text":"Went to Kwan the other day for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the place.  Ordered 7 dishes, that were all very good.  The only complaint with the food was that the fried octopus and turnip pancake were very greasy.  However, the other things we ordered like chicken feet, sticky rice in lotus leaf, siu miy, and the beef rice roll were all good.  Last thing thing that I wasn't particularly pleased with was that we sat 3 tables from the entrance.  The problem was that anytime the door was opened you felt the cold breeze fully.  They should have placed a barrier between patrons and the entrance so you don't feel the outside weather.  Besides that, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Much better quality than other dim sum restaurants that very often simply reheat frozen items. Newly renovated and modern decor. However, expect to pay a bit of a premium for that quality. I think that the prices are fair but this is not the place for someone wanting basic cheap dim sum."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chi restaurants in North York.  Food are delicious while price is very reasonable.  Must try.  The food is not like those in Markham and RICHMOND Hill - food in MH and RH are mostly oily with MSG.  Can't wait my second visit with my daughter!!!"}
{"text":"Deliciously flavoured food, clean interior, and friendly staff! Great tea selection. Make sure to try the deep fried squid tentacles."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back. We love dim sum and have been trying to find a new place in North York. Place is small, but tasteful decor. Staff were so polite and efficient. Everything was made fresh and delicious, nothing frozen! Our favourites were the scallop rice rolls, har gow, siu mai, and the BBQ pork buns. Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Save yourself the time and money and pick up some dim sum in the frozen aisles of the supermarket, instead of coming here. It's a \"wannabe\" dim sum chain with nice decor, but nothing more. The menu is small, the food is bland and they even charge for tea.  P.S. Why is there mustard on the table? Who serves mustard with dim sum? ?"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Kwan at York Mills and BOY! Night and Day between this location and the zoo that is at St. Clair. Service is WAY, WAY, WAY, Better here - you don't get the attitude, curtness, rudeness from staff here as you do at the St. Clair location. The vibe here is so much more relaxed, calm, and tranquil.   6 of us came here for dim sum on a Saturday without reservations and we got a nice table towards the back of the room (all by itself). This was for around 11:30, but by 1ish the place was completely packed so make reservations.  This Kwan serves only dim sum dishes so don't expect fried rice and noodle dishes galore. They do have congee dishes. The dim sum option that Kwan has here, is done very well. RIce rolls are plump and chewy. Egg tarts are softly poached in the middle. Items here are clean eats...nothing overly drenched in oil.  My new fave uptown dim sum place for sure. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Service along with the food was great and on point and very friendly. Price is very average as well. I would def be coming again. The sesame black bean dessert was delish. My only issue is the tea charge $2/person, I would be more comfortable with $2/table"}
{"text":"I am so happy I discovered this hidden gem, it's my absolute favourite dim sum place and I have tried alot of them!!! Everything I've ordered has been delicious, especially the honey garlic ribs, shrimp wonton soup, and garlic green beans. The food is always fresh and beautifully prepared. The servers are also very friendly and quick. You NEED to try Kwan, I will be coming back as often as possible!! :D"}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum at an affordable price! I ordered around 5-6 dishes which came out to a total of around $30 with tax (no tip because I got take out). The restaurant is smaller than most dim sum places and their menu has fewer options as well. However, the menu has the usual go-to items that you would typically order at a dim sum restaurant and that's all I need to keep me satisfied.   I've had my fair share of dim sum from many different places (esp as a hangover remedy after a night of clubbing LOLZ) and I would say this is probably one of my favourites so far. They definitely don't cheap out on the food, the dumplings are stuffed and the spare ribs have actual meat on them, not just the bones. Maybe it's the MSG overload, but I swear everything I got tasted so good.   The only part that was hard to judge was the presentation of the dishes since I got take out. It was unfortunate that the dumplings turned soggy by the time I got home, but of course I knew that was coming. Next time I would definitely love to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"After living just down the street, I had been eternally devoted to Crown Princess as my dimsum location of choice. Now, though, I can say that I have a close second for when I'm further up town.   While I normally hate glamour and fancy-for-the-sake-of-fancy,  one thing I love about these higher end dimsum restaurants is that they serve a quality pot of tea.  Like at Kwan, the selection doesn't need to be vast, but the quality of the leaves shows their attention to detail and your overall experience.  The dimsum offerings include standards like har gao, siu mai, rice flour rolls, and various dumplings - each delicately made and well flavoured. Not necessarily adventurous, but more surprising to find on the menu was  clam and chive crepes, which were a definite hit; reminisent of Hong Kong street food, savoury and perfectly fried. The only dish I didn't like was the fried \"lava buns\". After being fried, the fillings had solidified all the way through, and didn't have the runny texture you normally find in a baked or steamed  \"lou sa bao\".    Kwan at York Mills has classically modern (Chinese) decor, and looks shiny and new.  Made up of mostly two - tops put together for larger parties, the space isn't great for large groups. But for today's modern dim-sum-er, it could be just right.   All in all, a good place to go for dimsum in the area, and a solid four hedgehogs out of five.   HHHH"}
{"text":"As you know, most dim sum places do not have a price besides each item on the menu, instead, there is a  \"S-small\", \"M-medium\", \"L-large\" and XL. I found only one S on the menu, and the picture below is a simple of a large item, $6. Each of this roll is barely the size of my index finger. We used to be regulars. I guess it's not happening in the future."}
{"text":"Don't go to York Mills if you can go to the other one.  Yonge and St Clair Kwan is good and has an excellent and extensive menu. This place is a big miss"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst food ever. we ordered the fried needle noodle with shrimp and there was exactly 7 tiny shrimps in there and the rest was noodles. The Deep fried vegetable roles are horrible. Don't recommend this to anyone. waste of money."}
{"text":"I struggled with how many stars to give Kwan. Typically I take into account the aspirations of a restaurant and \"grade them on the curve\". I don't compare the food quality of a high-end expensive seafood house with an all-you-can-eat buffet, for example.  In the case of Kwan, their decor and pricing suggest they want to be at the high end of Asian dim sum restaurants, but given that aspiration, I think they fall short.   While the decor and food quality of Kwan is certainly better than your average 'down and dirty' dim sum place, their pricing, and therefore my expectation, is elevated, and unfortunately, given that expectation, they fail to impress.  Maybe I've been spoiled by visiting places like Dragon Boat and Skyline, but Kwan didn't blow me away, UNTIL I got the bill, with $2 per person tea charge as well as most popular dim sum dishes at $5 or typically $6 dollars, we ended up spending about $38 PER person including tea, tax and tip.  That's about 33% more than we spend at Dragon Boat, for a product that is not nearly as good as Dragon Boat, plus everything is smaller-sized, with smaller portions as well.  The quality is pretty good, but not impressive, the decor is quite nice for a dimsum restaurant, the service is efficient and absolutely fine, parking is equally crowded and problematic, and the prices are much too high, so 3 stars it is - everything is acceptable, but I won't be in any hurry to return."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find decent dim sum at a place like this. From the decor, this place looks nothing like a traditional Chinese restaurant. The basic dishes are on point with what you'll find at dim sum places in Markham/Richmond Hill. The prices are decent, the only down side is the dishes came one at a time so it was weird eating it in courses. Otherwise the service was pleasant and the wait wasn't too long even during the busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"Came here a while back. The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice. Portions for the price is really small and there are definitely better dim sum places in the city. Wouldn't really recommend this place to be honest. In addition, when I paid the bills, the waitress didn't come back with my change."}
{"text":"Modernized dimsum is more for me than the traditional type. It's definitely more relaxing and pleasing to the eye.   Everything is ordered from an order sheet instead of chasing down any carts. Although some like the carts cause you can see before you buy. But I find that style the food usually gets cold from being on the cart for so long. They have a moderate selection and dishes are not too greasy. Everything displayed nicely on the dishes. Each dish is on the small side definitely. Rice rolls only have four pieces vs six on the traditional ones. Sticky rice wrapped in lotus lead 2 here vs. 3.  Overall, food generally tastes good and the service is good. Decor is nice and new, bathrooms generally clean. Tea you pay more for here but I find their tea is real tea vs. powder tea in other places so I don't mind paying extra. Dishes smaller and pricier but I like the more relaxing atmosphere vs the loud bustling traditional dimsum restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is good here. Been here few times and had good experiences. I decided to take my mom out for her birthday and we made reservations but had to wait over 10 minutes and all the tables were full. Their excuse was that \"it was a busy night\". What is the point of making reservations if you're just going to make us wait? Some tables looked like they just sat down and some of those tables were only half full (2 people in 4 people table). They obviously didn't consider the fact that we are coming. Just really annoying."}
{"text":"Finally a dim sum location in North York. After living in this neighbourhood all my life, I knew that no authentic asian restaurant opens in this York Mills plaza. Until Kwan came along.  I guess it's not authentic in the way that there's not flashy decor with all the clatter. I did feel a little empty without all the bustle, but at the same time I was able to enjoy a quiet and calm meal and actually hear what people at my table were saying. The people working there spoke English too, which was good for non-Cantonese speakers like me.   Price wise, I would say it's similar to higher end dim sum locations uptown during the afternoon. Selection is similar too.  For me, I feel like there was something missing about the food but it was good! I'm just happy North York got its first dim sum restaurant!"}
{"text":"Being a rookie about Chinese cuisine, this place was recommended to me by a friend. Oh my my I tasted the best dimsums of my life over here. The atmosphere is classy and the colours in the restaurant definitley make it an ideal date place. The shrimp dim sums ar something to die for if you are a sea food fan.  I will definately go back to Kwan and try their wide spread of Bufet as well."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum place in the York Mills area. I guess the best part is you can have dim sum anytime of the day at this place, although not all items are offered at dinner time.  We had ordered: soup dumplings, pork dumplings, har gow, siu mai and the lotus leaf pouch with sticky rice.   It's not amazing but its not terrible either. But it is hard to compare to more traditional dim sum places in TO.  Pricing wise is on the pricier side compared to lunch dim sum places."}
{"text":"A common shortcoming of Chinese restaurants is that tasty food and a nice dining experience hardly go hand in hand. Kwan is definitely an exception. The dim sum here is great, yes even better than yoyr average Markham/Richmond Hill restuarants. The service is even better! The servers are much more polite and attentive than what you would experience at even one of the \"Crown\" or \"Royal\" dim sum places.   As well, I agree with Jennifer K that their tea is of a higher quality. So don't be put off by their location. This is not a Canadian-Chinese or \"fake\" Chinese food joint! This is a magical place where good dim sum and service co-exist in harmony."}
{"text":"Kwan at York Mills is good in a sense that they take reservations and the noise level is not too high.  The shrimp dumplings taste pretty good, the scallop rice roll can use some improvement as the wrap is a little thick.   The congee set is at a good price point. Overall the dim sum are pretty consistent. This is my second time coming back."}
{"text":"Went there with the family, and we did not like it. Ordered different things but everything tasted the same. Waiter seemed preoccupied calculating the restaurant's take for the day."}
{"text":"No you can't get this for $1.50/item in Markham/Scarborough. It's called a pleasant, clean experience which guess what people, you need to pay for!!! All the dim sum items I've tried were very good to great. Table was clean without sticky gross shit on it which applies to 80% of dim sum restos in GTA.  Please, please for those who don't mind eating in a filthy environment with rude service stay in Markham/Scarborough and enjoy yourself!! You'll save a few bucks too!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are always looking for an excuse to go have dim sum on the weekend, so when a new restaurant called Kwan's at York Mills opened near his house that specializes in all day dim sum, we definitely had to go.  We got there around noon on a Saturday and we were quickly seated. We sat down and ordered tea which was $2 per person, if you compare it to Scarborough/Markham dim sum restaurants it's definitely on the high end but the quality of tea was better.  The dim sum is ordered off a sheet of paper which lists all the items available for dim sum. The order sheet lists all items in Chinese and English, so if you can't read Chinese, no worries. The pricing per dish is small ($3), medium ($4), large ($5), extra large ($6). We ordered the following items.  Honey Glazed Beef Ribs: This was probably the only item I wasn't too fond of, meat was too tough and a little bit too much ginger for my liking.  Steamed Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow): really nicely done, nice thin skin and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Steamed Minced Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai): Really nicely done, nice thin outside skin and the inside was cooked right, not overcooked or undercooked.  Jumbo Shrimp Wrapped W/ Steamed Rice Flour Noodle: This is one of my favourite dishes when I go have dim sum, they did at a decent job at Kwan's. The skin wasn't too thick and the shrimp inside was cooked perfectly.  Steamed Chicken Feet: This was my favourite dish, great season and flavour but the best thing about the dish was they cut the chicken feet into pieces to make it more easily eaten. Most places just give you the whole feet.  Steamed Bean Curd Roll: Outside bean curd layer was nice and light and great inside vegetable filling.  The service was pretty good especially for a Chinese restaurant regardless of whether you spoke Cantonese/Mandarin or English. Also, they did a lot of small things that was impressive. When we asked for ice water instead of just giving us a glass each, they gave us a glass water jug, so we could refill our glasses instead of going back and asking the waiters/waitresses again. Also when we asked for a takeout box, they actually give you small reusable plastic tupperware containers instead of the traditional styrofoam container which is a great idea.  The decor is nice and new and the colours are very modern using dark mahogany colours. Also in terms of cleanliness, the place is very clean and the washrooms are very clean.  All in all, it's a great addition to the area because I don't think there are many dim sum restaurants in that particular area. The food is quite good, service is pretty good and it's a place you can feel comfortable eating at whether or not you can read Chinese or not. It's definitely priced slightly higher than their Markham/Scarborough but the quality, presentation and attention to smaller details make it worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic Dim Sum. We were so excited when this second location opened because we love Kwan at Yonge and St. Clair. Kwan at York Mills serves all-day dim sum that is incredibly fresh and high quality. Some of our favourites are the Shu Mai, the Har Gow, radish cake, BBQ pork buns. The restaurant is lovely, the staff are great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the relaxing music, decor and wood paneling. Not the usual dim sum restaurant where you cannot hear your own voice. Service with a smile.  Food was great.  I go at night which is unorthodox but best part is no wait for a table!  My favourite dim sum place to go."}
{"text":"I've been here before for dim sum closer to the grand opening maybe a few months after. I thought it was a great addition to the area, good dim, ia clean and comfortable environment. I can here today to have dim sum. Got a table fairly quickly within 2 minutes of arriving at 12 noon on a Saturday. Thought it was strange that a table would be available. I've been here before at this time and it's fully packed with line ups. The food has changed since I was here last. The dim sum has become a rough version of before. It is not the same quality as Kwan at St. Clair that is for sure. None of the dim sum plates have garnishes anymore. The food tasted \"rough\" not delicate. The spring roll rice roll was a severe disappointment. It didn't taste the same as St. Clair location. It was a regular spring roll inside as opposed to what I believe is usually a spring roll with fried bean curd wrap to preserve crispness. The rice roll wrap was too much and ratio to spring roll was unproportional. Steam items were acceptable. Steak BBQ pork buns. Milk custard tart and Mango pudding were good. Chicken dumpling with enoki was simply chicken siu mai wrapped differently. The washroom was disgusting and there was remnants in the toilet. No soap in dispenser. Overall place to go if you're looking for dim sum in the area but do not expect high-quality anymore."}
{"text":"I'm actually a tad disappointed in my first experience a Kwan. Because I had read a number of these reviews before coming, and because I'd been keeping an eye out for Kwan since before it opened, I was expecting quite a bit, especially since their four star Yelp rating has yet to go down.   For a slightly more upscale dim sum place (with prices to match), I was surprised at the quality of service we received. While they are Chinese run, given the neighborhood and the price point, I was shocked that they handed all of our cutlery and napkins to us in a dish, and gave us a stack of bowls, and expected us to serve ourselves. I'm not saying I can't get my own pair of chopsticks and my own bowl. I'm just saying that if other restaurants at lower price points can set my place for me, what strange concept is this that I have to do it myself? The tables themselves are fairly small. As a party of four, we ordered 11 things, and we couldn't fit everything on the table. They kept apologizing that there wasn't enough space, but made no effort to do anything about it.   Our table was along the wall, right next to the corner table. The corner table had chairs that were 90 degrees from our chairs. This meant that when a lady sat in the chair next to my grandfather's chair, her chair pushed up against him because there was no space. Not cool.  In terms of sizing, a small is $3, and each size up costs an additional dollar. They have five small sized items on their menu. Most of their items are large and extra large. Tea charge is $2/person. I'm not much of a tea drinker, so this price seems steep to me. I wonder if they'd charge me tea charge if I asked for water.  Passable dishes (that I probably wouldn't order again) - pumpkin congee with barley (I was looking for more pumpkin and larger portions), fried dough fritter with steamed rice noodle roll, fried bun with salted egg yolk filling (salted egg yolk filling did not ooze at all), steamed spareribs with black bean sauce (small for size), phoenix talon/chicken feet (small for portion).  Dishes I'd order again - pan fried pancake with [something] and clams, deep fried tofu with bbq eel (decent price for portion, but sloppily presented), pan fried radish cake (good texture. nice filling), and taro nest with seafood (piping hot. Could have been more seafood, but this one's one of my dim sum standards).   Total before tax and tips was $56 for four of us, and we didn't have any leftovers. Not the cheapest dim sum around.  I'll probably be back because it's close to my house, but it isn't my favorite dim sum place ever."}
{"text":"Close at 9pm on a Friday night?! That's really inconvenient and just all around lame."}
{"text":"This by far is my favorite dim sum in Toronto. This place has a wonderful and kind atmosphere. The food is always fresh and amazing. Kwan is my go to place when it come to a tasty lunch with amazing dim sum."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in Canada for me. I am a DS lover, and I could not find better place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very westernized dim sum - delicious but lacks authenticity. As someone who grew up eating dim sum, I take my dim sum quite seriously. Restaurant was nicely decorated but also very cramped. It is quite obvious that the restaurant caters towards those who have not had much dim sum experience - more of a starter dim sum restaurant (to hopefully make way for something more authentic). The food was okay - wasn't anything spectacular nor was it dissatisfying. Service was really good (which is better than most dim sum restaurants anyway)! A good place for those who are tentative about dim sum but want to try it out."}
{"text":"My favorite Dim Sum in the area. Wonderful service and atmosphere! The egg bun was excellent!"}
{"text":"Kwan proved to us after our first visit, that 1) They are all about Quality and Freshness with reasonable pricing and 2) That Dim Sum can be done right without coming short in service,  After searching endlessly for a damn good Dim Sum restaurant on Yelp, We found Kwan on Yelp we were NOT let down. We got there around 11:30 am, and you can tell the service is great because the server (owner?) Steve seated us and got us started with the Jasmine Tea without delay, and had a nice conversation with him through-out our visit. The food is prepared pretty fast considering everything is made fresh and you can tell by how amazing everything tastes, even the mustard sauce on the table is made in house and I mention that because I personally love it. You don't notice the wait thought as you sip on the authentic smooth Jasmine Tea (yes, real jasmine flowers in the tea) admiring the subtle decor and enjoying the cozy ambience.   The Breakdown:  -Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gow) -Scallop w/ Mushroom Dumplings -Seafood Snow Pea Sprout Dumplings -Vegetarian Dumplings  These Dumplings were the best we've ever had, I was starting to get sick and tired of the generic bland tasting dumplings we've had everywhere else but these were something else; big, FRESH, and stuffed with ingredients.  -Jumbo Shrimp Wrapped w/ Steam Rice Flour Noodle This is a star dish, other places have outsourced dough for the noodle, and make it too thick and blob-like but the noodle here is made from scratch in house and the difference is huge, nice, thin and fresh, one of our favourites.  -Cuttlefish w/ Curry Sauce tender pieces of delicious cuttlefish in a flavourful sauce, what more can I say?  -Deep Fried Squid Tentacles w/ Seasoned Salt this was some good squid, cooked just right with the seasoning just right and when you dip it into the Worcestershire sauce, everything is ...just right.  -Crispy Shrimp Roll w/ Mango I HAVE TO WRITE THIS IN CAPITALS BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST MIND-BLOWING DISH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE BORING, BUT WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT, IT'S THIS BLAST OF GOOEY GOODNESS I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN, JUST GET IT...JUST GET IT.  -Pan Fried Fish Cake a nice appetizer dish, light but firm, and goes well with the sweet chili Thai sauce that comes with it.  -Clam w/ Chives Crepe Unlike other restaurants, Kwan makes this dish properly, it's usually made thick and soggy, but here it's thin and crispy as it should be.  -Golden Lava Bun (fried) Sweet and crispy, gets better the more you bite into it.  Dessert: -Mango Pudding w/ Condensed Milk They don't skimp on quality at Kwan, that's evident with the rest of the menu, and even with dessert, this dessert is made with REAL MANGO, not pulp from a can, not food coloured jello. It swims in a light bed of milk and ends the meal off just perfectly.  Kwan will be our regular Dim Sum place, Steve is a great guy and very helpful, the food is above average, the prices can't be beat for quality and service. Already craving more, cant wait to try the rest of the menu, definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"A new location (original is at Yonge/st clair), it's of course smaller but still has ample seating for big groups.  The menu is significantly smaller than the original location so if you want a lot of variety then don't come to this location.  We ordered spicy shrimp dumplings (not spicy at all), squid tentacles, rice in lotus leaf, honey beef ribs, and milk custards.  I enjoyed everything except the beef ribs - it just wasn't my taste preference.    The service is friendly and if you get their VIP card you get 10% off when paying cash :)  Anyone who has been to Kwan knows they aren't cheap like other dim sum places, however sometimes the convenience outweighs the price since it's right in my hood.  Lots of parking in the plaza.  Unfortunately no half price before 11am like other dim sum places though."}
{"text":"Bayview / York Mills finally has a dim sum spot! Normally we go up to Highway 7 or east to Scarborough when we need a dim sum fix. We didn't have high expectations of Kwan but were pleasantly surprised. Prices are higher than typical Cantonese restaurants but so is the rent in this plaza.  The traditional steamed shrimp dumpling (har gow ???and Chiuchow fun gor (????) had quality fillings but the glutinous rice wrappers were a bit too sticky (too much water in the dough?).   Their modern dim sum creations were innovative, well-executed and quite delicious. We will go again for the deep-fried eel and soft tofu, exquisitely bound by a strand of seaweed. Also looking forward to the flaky baked eel pastry. On a roll here with the eel, lol.  The stuffed rice noodle (cheong fun ???that we ordered was a winner too. High quality fillings and a personal mini-pot of heated soy sauce. Fancy!  The male server didn't greet us at all when we entered but once we were seated, he was friendly and professional. Later, we heard him welcoming a group of Caucasians. I think the restaurant management should train their staff to greet everyone - not just patrons who obviously speak English."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch dim sum on a Saturday.  The restaurant itself is very nice - modern, clean without being overly gaudy like other dim sum restaurants uptown that are trying to become \"classier\". It is a pretty small restaurant and the tables are very close together, so probably not the best place for an intimate conversation.  We arrived around 12:30pm and only waited about 5 minutes for a table.  The food was really good! We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered. The only drawback was that it took probably about 20 minutes to get our first dish, so we were absolutely starving by the time something came to us. However, that may not be the norm since there was a large party at the back of the restaurant that might've been holding back the kitchen.  The price was very reasonable and probably cheaper than most places uptown outside of \"Early bird\" times. S-$3; M-$4; L-$5; XL-$6  Service was also excellent! One male server in particular was amazing - he always came by with a smile on his face, cleared our dishes without us asking, and even refilled out teapot before we even knew it had to be refilled. We really appreciated his genuine happiness.  Overall, a great place to get dim sum. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Great dim sum.  Kwan is able to maintain the authenticity of Chinese dim sum while keeping the dining area spotless!  No sticky table top, no food stain on plates/cups from previous customers and no green scrubs in the foods.  The staffs are just as loud and bossy as a traditional cantonese restaurant; this doesn't bother me, I like the efficiency.  The Yonge location gets busy during weekends fast (11:45ish) , I would visit the Yorkmills location if I don't wake up on time or expect most of my parties to be late...  Must try all shrimp dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum, fresh ingredients and great service. I will definitely be coming back. Came here this morning to have dim sum with a friend. Ordered many items off the menu. My favourite were their steamed rice rolls. Their shrimp and beef ones were delicious. I would skip the plan congee and donut rolls as there is no flavor in the congee. Their dumplings were fresh, filled with meat and veggies and didn't have a lot of fat within their filling. Lastly their milk tart and mango sponge cake were not overly sweet but completed our meal. Yes, it's a touch pricier than other places and yes there is a $2 tea charge per person however I feel that their environment, food and service make it worth it."}
{"text":"i do not recommend to anyone to come there. Obviously, there are not many asian people come there.  the flavour and quality are allright. overpriced in small portion. when we ordered, we waited too long. slow service but waitress are busy and rude. An old lady waitress suddenly interrupted and left and took off my receipt when I was in the middle of talking with her.  Don't be fooled by the nice interior space."}
{"text":"My new favourite dim sum spot! Reasonable prices and the dumplings were amazing. Service was also great which is rare for a dim sum place."}
{"text":"Great little dim sum place. Discovered it around first week of it opening inside this plaza. Small cozy place, nice decor and casual dining experience. The staff is very friendly and attentive and food arrived quickly.   Ordered 5-6 dim sum items for the boyfriend and I, including the usual like steam rice rolls with beef and watercress, crispy fried shrimp roll with mango, various seafood dumplings.   Food was really good, as far as dim sum goes. Don't think many places do it that poorly especially in the North York area. Price point on par with all the other dim sum places uptown, $3 for small, $4 for medium and $5 for large. Note, I barely saw any small items on the menu, and just a few mediums so most were large. Everything I got was a large menu item.   There is also a $2 charge per person for tea. Total cost of the meal was around $38 before tip."}
{"text":"Decent service. Food is ok. It is authentic dim sum place. Atmosphere is very good there, but the food is just not much different than other dim sum place and the shrimp dumpling could improve if they could use a better quality of the shrimp."}
{"text":"Good food, service, and the staff were polite and wished me a happy birthday. You can bring your own cake at no charge. Also free parking. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So happy that we found this place! MUCH cleaner then the typical Chinese joints.  The food is really good too. Some of our favs are the honey beef ribs, short ribs in black bean sauce (My husband wants to pour the sauce over a bowl of rice to eat it!), sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, shrimp wrapped in rice noodle, etc. Definitely will go there over and over again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a mother's day dinner with the family and the comfortable atmosphere was about the only thing we liked about Kwan at York Mills.  Oh wait, their tea was ok, too.  The restaurant is small and we were seated right away (had a reservation although the restaurant didn't get full during our dining).  We ordered variety of dim sum items ranging from the usual siu mai (meh), har gow (meh), beef and watercress meatball (good), xiao long bao (ok), chicken feet (undercooked)...etc to some a la carte items like sweet and sour pork (ok), hot and sour soup (meh), pot rice with chinese sausage (no!), deep fried sweet potatoes (undercooked)...etc.    The execution on some items like tempura squash/sweet potatoes, pot rice and chicken feet was so far below average, it was disappointing.  The tempura battered squash/sweet potatoes were still hard, rice in the pot rice was too hard and chewy (how do you do this?) and chicken feet were stringy (seriously off-putting).    Although Kwan offers the best dim sum atmosphere (I hate the busy and noisy mega dim sum joints), their food leaves A TON to be desired.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  All the dishes we had were excellent.  Hot, and delicious. I would say it was the best Dim sum we have had to date in the GTA.  Service and Servers were good as well.  Will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. Oddly quiet for a dim sum place and not crowded. Service was very good. Very relaxing. After not having eaten solid food for a couple of days I was very hungry and so this review may be somewhat tainted. ;)  Scallop Cheung Fon was outstanding. They were small relative to Cheung Fon in other restaurants. Next time would order two. XL. Siu Mai was good. L. Steamed dumplings with seafood and scallop were delicious but not much scallop inside. XL. Sticky rice was very good. Three steamy pouches of yummy. L. Chicken with enoki mushroom dumplings did not have a lot of taste. Would not order again.  Turnip cake was good with a couple of pieces to take home. M. Mango pudding was excellent. So much mango flavour and silky texture. L.  Definitely a repeat when it's just the two of us."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Everyone was on slow motion here. It's a tiny place with barely a waiting space. For the price point, I expected a more professional service staff.  Food was fine but way overpriced. If you're a local, perhaps it's worth coming here. There's few options within, um, bus distance. But if you do drive, you've got better options at Leslie & Finch, Don Mills & Finch, Victoria Park & Tempo.  So poor service, overpriced food, and small dining area.  1 star out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Good tasty food but not cheap.  Has all your Cantonese staples.  The congee looked good but didn't try given my preference for small plate dim sum.  The place is kinda small and really not a kid friendly place.  Parking is easy since it wall in the mall plaza.   I would have liked it more if the place was roomier."}
{"text":"We came here for mother's day at 10am right when they opened and had a great meal! By 11am, they already had line ups so I would recommend to come early to avoid any waiting.  The food was fantastic. I am a fan of the original Kwan on St Clair but I would say this location is even better for dim sum. The shrimp rice roll was so smooth... Apparently they make the rice flour rolls freah in house daily.  The egg tart and milk tarts were very fresh and its pastry was flaky and melted in my mouth.  The deep fried dumpling with minced pork inside was really good too... This tends to be very doughy at other places but it was thinner, perfectly crispy and chewy at the same time.  The waiter also recommended some dishes that were quite unique like the pan fried eel cake, which i have never had before.  Their dim sum staples like the har gow, siu mai and sticky rice in lotus leaf were solid!  I will definitely be going back. So awesome that there is a great place for dim sum in North York now!"}
{"text":"As if 8 minutes drive wasn't close enough to dim sum already, Kwan opened up just down the street from my in laws! We were excited to finally sample a new dim sum restaurant.   The pleasure of dining with a large group - sampling the entire menu! Some of my favs included classics like ha gao, shui mai, spare ribs, mango pudding, and egg/milk tarts!   However, most of my usual favs were simply not as good as ones I had in other dim sum places.   Fried sweet dough with minced meat - barely any filling. The sweet dough wasn't as sweet either.  Fried taro seafood ball - again lacked the usual amount of filling. Way too much fried crust!   Fried sweet custard bun - way overcooked. The gooey custard dried out completely.   Sticky rice wrapped in Lotus leaf - lots of rice but where were the fillings? In addition - way under seasoned.   Shrimp roll with mango - loaded with mayo, barely any remnant of shrimp or mango.   Chicken feet, beef rolls - again under seasoned...   We also sampled some of the more innovative items - fried yam balls, fried eel cake, clam pancakes - all of which I thought were okay - probably would never crave them again.   Service was a bit overbearing. They were so quick in taking away everything - even with a shui mai still in the tray! When we told the male server we weren't done, he scolded back by accusing us in misleading him by placing it on the edge.  When we were submitting second orders, the lady was being really pushy in selling the XL items.   Overall - the foods were mediocre for the most part. Even the better tasting items weren't anything special. The menu offers a less extensive number of options compared to other dim sum places in the area. Values - relatively similar to the higher end dim sum places - I think I would much rather go to those even with if they require a further drive."}
{"text":"Such great customer service and everything was so delicious. My second time here and I will definitely be back! My favourite dim sum restaurant!"}
{"text":"- The decor really stands out and the ambiance was wonderful - Recommended item : ha gow, shui mai, spare ribs and mango pudding - Service could have been a bit better. Similar to most dim sum spots around town. - Price to quality ratio was fair.  - Definitely will try out the rice roll with beef next time."}
{"text":"This place is well-designed. I've tried Kwan first at St. Clair and i was in love with it, so I decided to try at York Mills and the food was good too. This is a great place for me whenever I wanna eat dimsum"}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum. Tried a few dishes on the menu and liked everything except the parsnip cake (that's only because I don't really like parsnip).  Place is clean and the decor is amazing. The staff was amazing as well. Will definitely return. I was told it's very busy at lunch..we went around dinner and it was quiet."}
{"text":"Amazing , traditional , made to order , fresh ingredients! Need I say more?  Not your grandma's chart house.  Upscale , classy , elegant even!  Very date friendly!  And Dim Sum all day, in the middle of North York?  All signs point to 5 stars:)  No gimmicks just amazing Dim Sum!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner because we were craving dim sum. Took a while for them to greet us. They don't have a hostess at the front of the restaurant. One of the servers has to come and take you to a table. On this particular night there was only two people working - an elderly woman (who looked like she should not be working anymore) and a middle aged man. We had to wait for him to finish with his tables to come and sit us at a table.   Once seated, he brought out tea (tea is not complementary here). Then we placed the order for the food. While we were waiting for the food we were sweating quite a bit. When the waiter came with the food we inquired about air conditioning. He said that the air conditioner is not working! It was pretty bad because it was one of the hottest days this summer.   I found the fried items to be extremely oily. The oil was dripping off some of the items we ordered. The steamed items were good but we weren't able to enjoy it because we were drenched in sweat by this time. Finally we decided we couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave. We got the food to go and asked for two glasses of water. The water was too temperature and one of the glasses weren't clean.   To sum up, I would never go back to this spot and wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy. One of the servers didn't understand English very well and she was getting frustrated and rude with me. Service was terrible. Food was okay except for the fried items. I think this place is overly hyped."}
{"text":"This is a higher end dim sum place. They serve dim sum all day. The food here is relatively good, and one of the major pluses is that the food is really hot and seems like it was just finished being cooked. Unlike other dim sum restaurants, or restaurants in general, where the food just sits and waits to be delivered and gets cold. On the other hand, there seemed to be so fushiony stuff going on. One of the dishes we ordered was labeled fried shrimp with mango, and it came in a fried piece of dough stuffed with shrimp, mango and mayonnaise. Really not good. Additionally the pricing here is ridiculous. They are trying to get away with being a \"higher-end\" dim sum place but it doesn't work."}
{"text":"I was really craving some dim sum and I decided this would be great to try since it is close to work. So I was here with my boyfriend for my lunch break today.   Right away we were greeted and seated. The gentleman offered beverages right away. So far the service was great. We ordered our food two orders of honey garlic beef ribs, two orders of shrimp rolls, shrimp dumpling, har gow, and scallop dumplings. It all came at a reasonable time and everything was service fresh. The food tasted wonderful!!!  The only downfall may be the cost of the dishes. A XL is $6, L is $5. I mean really for the quality of food and the location it is okay however you know you can go to Markham and get cheaper dim sum. However I definitely see myself coming back here! The service and the quality of food, THANK YOU"}
{"text":"Outstanding - all food prepared fresh after ordering The tastes and textures were great Dim sum is available all day. I ordered Har Gaw (5 Star), Siu Mai, Honey glazed beef ribs, Steamed beef balls and scallop dumpling, the taste was delicious. The service was excellent, the waitress was friendly and professional. Overall the dim sum was great. This is my second time coming back and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Classy dim sum resto that doesn't cost an arm and leg and no chaotic line ups? Sign me up!   Kwan dim sum has great service, nice atmosphere and tasty dim sum.  This place is civilized and classy but not bougie.   It's not the cheapest but definitely worth every penny if you are looking for a change from your typical dim sum scene."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Kwan, and unfortunately it let me down.  I am someone who is willing to pay a premium for high quality dim sum, but I think in the case of Kwan you are paying for the expensive Don Mills real estate and the somewhat fancy dining room.  When I pay top dollar for dim sum, I want top quality tasting dim sum, and I did not get that here at Kwan at York Mills.    First of all, the menu is very small compared to the Kwan at Yonge & St Clair, which is something I didn't realize when deciding to try this location.  I mainly chose the York Mills location because it has parking, and is close to my mom's place, since we were taking her out for lunch.  Hargow and shiu mai were both really bland, and the deep fried squid, tough and soggy, not crispy.  The scallops in the cheung fun were chewy and very fishy tasting.  Many of the dishes arrived cold, which is sometimes understandable in a place with carts, but from a place where you fill in the sheet and have items brought to you when ready, this is unacceptable.  Service was really slow and often non existent as well, if I have to work that hard to order tea and beer, and receive it after most of the food, I consider that a complete fail on the servers part.  Based on this experience, I doubt I will even give Kwan on Yonge a try, I should learn from this lesson and stay faithful to my current favourite -Elegance Chinese Cuisine in Markham, which is completely worth the trip to Markham."}
{"text":"The food are always warm and good, they have a clean restaurant and the service is really nice too. !"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 0 stars.  I called and ordered one piece of \"yau ja gwai\" (aka \"yau tiu\", the fried dough that people normally eating with congee).  Of course it was my mistake that I did not ask how much.  The restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at about noon.  It was quite dark inside.  I went to the cashier and found out it costed $6.5.  It's the most expensive \"yau ja gwai\" I ever had.    When I got home and opened it, the content inside the box was actually \"ja Leung\" (fried dough inside steamed rice roll)!!!!!  When I called and ordered, I clearly said \"yau ja gwai\" not \"ja Leung\", it seems that the waitress does not understand Cantonese much, and how authentic a dim sum place is when the waitress cannot even understand Cantonese?   Even for people who cannot speak Cantonese, I am pretty sure you can try to pronounce the word and they don't even sound the same.  (Dim sum is Cantonese food, and I would say 99.9999% of dim sum place in the greater Toronto area is operated by Cantonese people)"}
{"text":"All Day Dim Sum?  I was a little skeptical but now I believe that Kwan at York Mills can deliver hot and delicious dim sum all day. As there are 5 dim sum chefs working in the kitchen and everything you order is made fresh.   The price is in line with most other dim sum places starting from $3 and up. The tea charge of $2 definitely worth it as the quality of the tea is good (they have different kind of Chinese tea so just ask).  We just ordered a few dish to try with recommendation for our friendly waitress:  Steamed Rice Roll with Watercress with Beef (L) ?????? Transparent Soft Cake (M) ????? Bean Curd with Oyster Sauce (M) ????? Deep Fried Lotus Root & Pork Cake (L) ????? Seafood with Snow Pea Sprout Dumplings (L) ?????  I love their Rice Roll. They prepared everything from scratch including grinding rice to make the paste for the rice roll wrap. The wrap has a great QQ texture, a little thick but yummy!  Everything was fresh and delicious. The quality is as good or even better than some of the dim sum restaurants in Markham/Richmond Hill!  The deco is really chic and trendy. A quiet place to enjoy a chat with friends over some good food. Closes at 5:30 pm Monday to Thu but on other days they opens till 10 pm they offers an additional menu on top of dim sum.  Highly Recommended especially there is no other dim sum restaurants in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Clean, neat, delightful dim sum place.  Reasonable prices, comfortable sitting, good choice of interior and music.  Prompt services.  Better quality food for sure!!  It was a perfect Saturday brunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and tasted awesome. I want to come back every weekend. Modern contemporary atmosphere. Didn't use too much msg. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"$2 for tea is a bit steep. The food is decent but pricey. $5 for a large. The service is very good."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving it a 3 or 4 stars only for the fact that their tea charge is so steep at $2/pp which really adds up when you have a larger party! But other than that, the food was surprisingly good and better than I've had at other places.  It's definitely more of a modern restaurant than your traditional dim sum spot. But don't be fooled by appearances, the menu items stay true to a lot of things you can find at any other yum cha place! I would definitely recommend the Deep Fried Taro with Chicken and the Steamed Rice Roll with Watercress and Beef!  Would I come again? Maybe if I'm in the area but there was nothing that was so spectacular that I would try again. I would go check out Spring Villa too if you get a chance"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise I must say. We ordered a little as we were a skeptical, but everything was delicious!  Finally, a place in the north York area worth going to. More pricey tho. turnip cake was pan fried to a crisp. The dumplings were  meaty and seasoned well. Squid tentacles were barely battered which was great. Yes I believe tea was $2pp Will go back soon!"}
