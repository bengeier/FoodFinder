{"text":"Great place! Stopped for a bloody and sandwich. The clientele was spot on and the bartender knew everyone by name. There aren't many places left in Madison where you can get a $6 burger. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Well I had another great experience with their Friday fish fry! All you can eat dinner with soup/salad for $12! REAL cod!! yum yum"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance so I thought I'd check it out on a Sunday. It does seem to be a place where the locals hang out (and I guess I'm a local now). But the service was friendly, my turkey sandwich was really yummy, and the beer was pretty good. I kind of want to stop in on a Friday to try the fish fry."}
{"text":"This place has is a nifty little home-town feeling bar and family-type restaurant. The food is ok but nothing to shout about. Its seems like everyone really likes this place but to be honest i'm not a huge fan... The reason is that I work nearby in which it requires me to wear a suit. This place is really close and a nice place to grab lunch at. As soon as I walk in everyone sitting in yesterday's clothes drinking at 2:00 in the afternoon. It's just really unwelcoming to \"outsiders.\" I won't say they do that all of the time but 2/3 times they do. Aside from that it does have kind of a cool sports bar type atmosphere. Big Screen TV's and such make for some spotting of the games and they are pretty good. Going there afterwork is pretty fun but still not the everyday place I want to go to watch some games."}
{"text":"It's not the best fish fry, but if you're looking for a decent one on a busy friday night then this is your place."}
{"text":"I had never been to alt n bachs before and stopped in to grab a burger and beer. I was not disappointed the burger was tasty and cooked to perfection. The beer selection was good and very reasonably priced. My bartender (Julie I think) provided excellent service and friendly conversation. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry I have missed this place for the 9 years I have lived in Madtown. Bought some furniture next door and thought I would check it out. A friend had recommended a few years ago and I wish I had stopped in sooner.  Walk in the door, and the smell from the kitchen is awesome.  Friendly service.  Nice bar.  And really good pub food. Friendly clientele. Great prices. What's not to like? Had a ribeye and fried shrimp. Ribeye was thin but perfectly cooked. Shrimp was battered and crunchy in a good way. Prices were great. Very nice place. Kind of place where A lot of folks have been coming for a very long time.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I always wondered about this place with its very interesting location. First visit and ok tap list for a bar of this kind. Got fries, mushrooms, onion rings, and cheese curds. All basic fried stuff no stand outs. Mushrooms we're not good. Server was very nice and attentive. Booths not terribly comfortable. My first visit did not inspire a follow up visit. It works if you work next door but not worth going to otherwise."}
{"text":"This spot is such a great place for yummy bar food and drinks.  The servers and bartenders are so warm and welcoming, the old fashions are great (and cheap), and I really enjoy the Friday Fish Fry."}
{"text":"Definitely a family place. My grandparents took me here for a good old Wisconsin Friday night fish fry.   I had the fish sandwich, which was pretty good, though I don't have much to compare it to. The fish was pretty light and the tartar sauce was good. Choose wisely: the fish meals come with either a really big side of fries or a really small cup of coleslaw.  The owner came around to all the tables with a plate of cookies after we had finished dinner (it was a few days before Christmas), giving the place a small town feel. The other half of the place is a bar, which I didn't have the chance to visit."}
{"text":"2 stars because my food was hot and they poured a beer right.  I've stopped by Alt N Bachs a few times for lunch as I work close by. Not really blown away by anything in particular about it. TVs for sports - dining area - and a bar.   The food is mediocre at best and the markup on it is wholeheartedly insulting for what you get in both quality and quantity. I could make a trip to the grocery store and cook almost the entirety of their menu at home without much effort.   Drinks are overpoured a little sometimes but they're definitively not the cheapest when you compare to other bars. Also, Im not sure if their regular day bartender has just lost touch with his manners or has been doing his job too long to care anymore - but he was definitely not the most pleasant person behind the bar. His mannerisms is more of \"What do you want? Ok give me your money. Goodbye.\" which makes me think he might be a part owner. But I digress.   This bar is expensive for no reason, Ive always left feeling like I paid too much for a mediocre experience and lunch. Other bars close in the area are better choices for cheaper, higher quality food and better drink prices.  You won't be blown away, and I'm still personally confused on how their customer following came to be but hey...it's there if you want to pay $7 plus a tip for a sandwich that can be made for $2.50"}
{"text":"I likie it!   fun volleyball, respectful crowd, a little dark in the bar area, and FREE popcorn!"}
{"text":"food is always wonderful, always great people working. Alt' N Bachs is simply the best!"}
{"text":"Their claim to fame is their burger, but I have had much better.  The patty was thin and overly seasoned.  It only comes with cheese and everything you have to ask for extra.  I asked for lettuce, but I didn't get it.  There were no pickles anywhere.  Blasphemy.  The fries were kind of thin and skimpy.  Much better burgers at the Wisco and Ella's."}
{"text":"We visited this establishment on a Saturday and found plenty of room for our party of three. Its a nice place just off the beltline and has a good cheeseburger. I'm only giving this place three stars because we all had the same thing so no other food options were tried. We also had a delay in being welcomed by the wait staff after sitting at our table. Once we were acknowledged she did return at regular intervals to check on us. The other issue was the smokers puffing away a little too close to the door. When the door was opened the smell of cigarette smoke entered the room. This is a place I will return to and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but I liked the basic and very casual experience of this place. The menu wasn't anything special but the waitress was nice and I enjoyed the local feel."}
{"text":"Alt's is a fine bar and restaurant.  The burgers are a little too greasy for my taste but they always have good flavor.  Prices are fine too.  It is more of a Badger Sports bar and has a faithful following that has developed over the years so you see a lot of these old timers there and also some new timers.   It is rather small compared to other sports bars.  The servers have always been nice when I have been there."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers on town.  Fresh, never frozen beef, on great Colonial buns.  Friendly staff, and prices are good.   Don't miss the Friday night Fish Fry, one of the best around."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since it opened in 1975, sure I was just one years old...anyways Babe and I went because it's a Madison staple. We both had cheeseburgers medium rare with American and fried onions as a basket for $7.15. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, fries are skinny like I like them. The atmosphere is friendly and it's locally owned with locally sourced products. Also it's open on Sundays, which for us is a major plus and the booths have padded seats. We always go to restaurants for lunch and on Saturday it took like five minutes to get our food, now I don't know how busy they get on game days or at night but it was nice and leisurely on a late July Saturday."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for lunch after doing some shopping where we could enjoy a beer and a good burger.  We hit the jackpot with Alt N Bach's!  Our burger was delicious and the atmosphere was very relaxing.  I had the burger with mushrooms and fried onions.  My date had the blue cheese burger and both were very tasty.  The fries were e also delicious.  We especially liked that they had local craft beers on tap.  Would definitely recommend for a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"A consistently good, unpretentious Madison fixture. Good food and drink, with a staff that is attentive to what they are there for.   No \"off somewhere playing with my new I-phone which is much more interesting than my customers\" type of nonsense. You won't be left chewing on your ice cubes before you're asked if you're ready for another one.   Not pushy, just simply (and rarely elsewhere) attentive.   I used to go there all the time for lunch. :-)  Then my company moved. :-(  So I couldn't go every week.  Then I met someone there that I met online. :-)  Then I married her. :-)))   !!!!  So, I guess this is not exactly an unbiased review, but I hope you will give them a try. They certainly will do the same for you!*   *Results not guaranteed. Your actual mileage may vary. Void where prohibited."}
{"text":"Great food. Varied menu. Courteous and friendly staff. Quick service. Very clean. Daily specials. Homemade soup and desserts. Kid friendly in the dining room. Great tvs in bar to watch a game. Fantastic neighborhood bar & eatery."}
{"text":"Gotta love Alt' N Bach's! Fun bar sports, great bartenders. I come by often when I'm visiting home."}
{"text":"Good bar food on the cheap!  When I was a kid my family would stop here after visits to Ward Brodt or Steinhafel's or after one of my brother's hockey games. Their chili was the big draw, and my parents would often order extra to take back home for a meal the next day. Despite having fond memories, I'd never come back as an adult until last weekend.   There are a few doors on different sides of the building, and we happened to wander into the restaurant side (that I didn't know existed - I think we always ate in the bar as a kid). It's seat yourself, and we were quickly visited by a server. We got drinks in and perused the large-ish menu. I chose the Burger of the Week - the Wild Bill. It came with cheddar, bacon, onion rings, and a barbecue aioli. I opted to make it a basket with fries for an extra $2. My boyfriend got the three-piece cod fish fry and a bowl of clam chowder, which came with a lot of food and which he enjoyed.  I inhaled my burger - my request for it to be well done was heeded without turning it into a hockey puck. They use Knoche's beef, so it was good quality. The bacon was nice and crispy and the onion rings were crisp as well. The aioli was a little runny, but the sweetness added an interesting dimension to the burger. The fries were crispy, but kind of blah - they're just frozen bag fries and are on the bland side. I almost never use ketchup or leave a fry behind, but both situations came to pass. Onion rings are the same cost as fries - I'd definitely opt for the onion rings next time.   I was a little surprised that my basket came out to $9.25 - everything else on the menu is super cheap and most baskets are about $7. The price was still reasonable for what I got, but just note the Burger of the Week is a bit more if you're dining on a budget.   Service was decent - our server was nice but kept forgetting to bring things (water, a to-go box). She did apologize; it seems she was at the end of a long shift. No big deal.   We'll definitely be back and I'm looking forward to trying the chili to see if it's as good as I remember from my childhood."}
{"text":"Alt' N Bach's serves great bar food and pours strong drinks. As a vegetarian, I never imagined I could eat good food here. Besides very good soups and salads (and a veggie burger), co-owner Kathleen brings in vegetables from her garden and they make veggie and turkey ciabattas with them, as well as a very tasty caprese salad. Not your usual bar food, at very reasonable prices and with great service from the staff."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 30+ years. It's darn good bar food. Not really a dive bar -- it's a nice family oriented establishment. The soups are home made. They have the best greasy bar burgers and aren't afraid to serve them medium rare when requested. Food is reasonably priced and they always have a daily special. I go there for lunch and service is usually pretty fast. The only complaint I can make is that they recently changed their hamburger buns after all these years"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the Friday Fish Fry. I liked that they had options other than all you can eat (2 or 3 piece options). They also made a great old fashioned that was only $4. Service was good but the food took a little while to come out. For two people and two drinks the check was only $30ish.   Don't expect anything fancy, but it's good if you're looking for a very casual night out."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite and was not disappointed. Fast, friendly service. Lots of choices and everything was delicious. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you come after the weekly softball game. And that's exactly what my team mates and I do. We show-up sweaty, despite of that they give us an excellent service, greasy, yummy fried food + strong drinks. Perfect. Don't expect gourmet here because you're not going to get it.   On Friday, they serve airy cod fish fry, which I thought was pretty good. My new favorite munchie  here is deep fried button mushroom ($6) - pretty good  if you could tolerate the thick breading. The patrons in the dining hall (which is separated from the bar area) tend to be older folks with their kids or grandkids. Very nice and homey atmosphere.  There's a beach volleyball court in behind the bar. So if you want to preserve your figure after loading up on the deliciousness, you could do that."}
{"text":"I was looking for a 'new to me' dive bar in the area that serves decent food. This may be the place. It is tucked a little off the frontage road and may be a little hard for someone to just stumbled upon it. You kinda need to know where you are going to find this place. I was a little confused when we walked in the front door. This entrance led to two more doors. I didn't know which door led where. The left door goes into the restaurant side of the business, or so it seemed. The right door led to the bar area.  We opted for the bar area with TVs to watch the game. It was moderately busy with people playing darts, watching the game, hanging out with friends, etc. There is a fair amount of tables and bar seating to accommodate a lot of people. There's a side door off of the bar area that leads to an enclosed area for smokers. At least that's what I think it was. People kept coming and going into that space and it looked as though they were smoking.  Everything on the menu was super affordable and it had a lot of options. I had the patty melt with a side of onion rings. The patty melt was Knoche's beef and it was really juicy and lean meat. The cheese and onions made it even better. The rings were nicely fried to a medium color. A nice crunch on the outside, with a nice flavorful onion interior. They offered a nice portion on the side. Both the sandwich and the rings were great dipped in ketchup. They have a decent selection of taps and offer a full bar for cocktails. Another patron noted that their fish fry on Fridays is great. I may need to stop back in to check it out."}
{"text":"Cute little dive bar. Husband and I decided to check it out for lunch.   Almost everything on the menu is less than $10 which is kind of nice. I got a turkey rueben and he got a steak sandwich. Both of us were happy with our food, and I always enjoy a good onion ring.   I'd like to come back and try their fish fry, and will probably lengthen my review at that time."}
{"text":"I'm on a fall volleyball league at Alt' N Bach's. They do a great job of managing the league. This may seem like a silly thing to note but I've joined leagues where the bar doesn't care to organize the league past taking people's money. This bar league is well organized so, for that, they get a few stars!  As a vegetarian, I don't expect much from bar food. I ordered a garden burger and fries. I ate all my fries and picked at the burger. My guess is they use frozen, pre-made veggie burgers. There wasn't  much distinguishable flavor. What I'm saying is, I wouldn't come here for the food.   As for the staff, I have had very good service and very poor service. It's a toss up depending who your server is. All and all, it's a Madison bar with bar food."}
{"text":"Great after hours place.  Beer and food is cheap.  Service is professional."}
{"text":"Adorable cute family owned and run diner. You can tell everyone there from the staff to the customers have been there for years and know the place like the back of their hand. It's definitely tucked away but it's worth looking for. You get this home-y feeling and all warm and fuzzy inside. Their food isn't bad too ;)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of chill neighborhood dive bars and that's exactly what this place is! Struck up some nice conversations with the wait and bar staff. They don't have a lot of beers on tap but a few good ones. I would say I like this place more for the comfortable and welcoming feeling you get there. Like everyone has been your best friend for years. :) The food was decent and pretty inexpensive. I would say check it out especially if you're just looking for a chill beer at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place has gone downhill. They used to have really good food. I loved their pesto chicken sandwich but that's not on the menu anymore. We went for dinner Friday night. It was busy which is good to see for a local establishment. I ordered the steak sandwich no bun and a side of cottage cheese. I got a super thin unseasoned piece of steak and a small cup of cottage cheese. The steak was so gross I needed steak sauce. The bill came. $11 for what I got. That is ridiculous. I will never eat here again.  But on a good note, the bartenders are usually friendly and they have tasty cocktails."}
