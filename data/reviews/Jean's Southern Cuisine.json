{"text":"I was here with my  family  and can't  believe how nasty    some of these people are. I also   wonder  if they actually wash  hand  after  preparing   each food. As a retired  Chef you need to  wash hands ALL the time.  I will never go back here again  pppppfffffttttt"}
{"text":"I haven't had a full dinner from them. My Boyfriend introduced me to this restaurant because I had a taste for some good mac & cheese. And I must say it is SPLENDID! We got it as a side and honestly I wish we would have gotten a large. After all mines was gone i was peaking over at his for some more. Reasonable price for a side $3. Customer service is good."}
{"text":"My wife and I were invited to a high school graduation party that was held here tonight for 30 guests.    We showed up around 20 minutes after the scheduled arrival time only to be told there was absolutely no food left.  My wife confronted one of the kitchen workers after she saw him putting away a pan of macaroni and cheese instead of serving it to the guests!  Guests who arrived earlier told us the food was disgusting.  We even had to get our own drinks from the kitchen.  This place has the worst customer service that we've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"I came to Jean's with a group of 8-10 people, and the food was excellent. My favorite was the cheesy beef rigatoni---it was very seasoned and flavorful. The fried chicken was also very good. The seating is open and comfortable. This place is great for groups to come. Plus, we were served buffet style which allowed for second and third helpings."}
{"text":"Discusting! Chef had her wig everywhere! Slipping from her head an touching food! Rude and servers crying it was a mess"}
{"text":"Hard to find, since it is in huge building. I ordered chicken a half bin of chicken. It was decent. Staff was friendly"}

The was terrible it was worth the money l spent.she's a terrible business person.She ever answer my letter and didn't call me back. LaSawn Wilkerson"}
{"text":"This restaurants food quality would be a 7/10 from me. I do not personally LOVE the food but it is okay. You may be better off making it yourself and adding more seasoning. It's difficult to find the restaurant because there aren't any signs in the Hosanna House to find it. Also the employees are not always nice; it seems as if they are only worried about the money instead of genuinely satisfying you as a customer."}
{"text":"Ms jean catered my wedding last week.... It was a disaster . She breach the contract by not having the linens ready for the tables at 9am for my 3pm reception ..... Food was not served at 3pm..... Had my guest setting the table.... That was her staffs job to do.... I paid for my guest to have two meats they only received one...... She was rude to my husband.... My dad .... And other guest.....  I told her I have two grandmas that are diabetics and had to be severed with the bridal party.. They weren't ... We paid for 100 guest to eat only 67 showed up.... There was extra food left over.... She took the food with her .... The day before the wedding she explained to me that the guest could have the rest of the food but the bride would have first choice.... I understand there was a death in the family but if you couldn't do the job right you should have had someone fill in..... Oh and the caters were eating in front of my guest during the reception....(ghetto)... And the utensils while serving ... Was an ice cream scooper to serve macaroni and cheese at a wedding ) (ghetto )... I will never do business again with ms jean. Lost me as a customer... Hosanna House never recommend her services again. My guest did say the food was good..... But it was over topped by the rude service ...... And don't pass out business cards to my guest and you were rude to them.... All they did was throw them away."}
{"text":"Great Improvement! I love the pork...Was put in PA and had to stop by after seeing this place on TV."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Staff was excellent.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you love authentic southern cooking.  The Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens are excellent. The portions are nice and the bread is out of this world.  The desserts are great!"}
{"text":"Her food is very good but Ms. Jean and her son are very nasty and the staff isn't much better!!! Her attitude is terrible! No matter how nice you are she is still not nice. They have cut back drastically on the portions you get if you go on Sunday and get the buffet to go!!! I don't understand that. It's not like you are able to get anymore helpings. I really wish they would improve their attitude and go back to giving you a real portion when you get the buffet to go."}
{"text":"The food I actually got to try was excellent however the staff was down right mean and nasty. I was verbally attacked for no reason I just wanted to try the fried chicken and watermelon I had seen on kitchen nightmares all of the sudden I was being very rudely told to leave by the staff it was bizarre they didn't even ask for payment just insulted me and forced me to leave. I won't be going back even if the food is great."}
{"text":"I got a portion of Mac N Cheese and Collard Greens to go as we were just driving through town. We live in Maryland, so wanted some thing filling to get me home. Honestly, i've been dutched ovened with the Fart from the Bowels of Satan himself before and when I opened the container, the smell that proceeded to waft through the car would have made Satan weep. The people were rude. Thank the lord, they skimp on portions, because if I had opened up a full portion, I feel like FEMA would have to declare my car and Disaster Area. Collard Greens were canned and I looked at them with a only a look reserved for a Step Child of the Ginger variety. SO much disappointment, very little reward. Now I know what it's like to be a Raven's fan."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had fried chicken wings, greens (cooked with turkey) and macaroni and cheese. Very reasonably priced. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was I called in my order ahead and was told 15 minutes but it took 35."}
