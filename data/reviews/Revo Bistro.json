{"text":"The food was great! Expert service with great advice and recommendations.  This Bistro stands out among it's counterparts along the strip with it's inviting patio & classy European atmosphere. Great date venue."}
{"text":"Please save yourself the arguments, time, and money and stay away.  I wish I had seen these reviews before I went... The chef/owner .. Stefan or whatever his name is.. is the worst excuse for a businessman. He is SO rude and the reviews below are correct. He needs anger management. He doesn't understand the principle that the customer always comes first.  We sat down for a nice quiet meal. After looking at the menu and asking a few questions about certain meals, he suddenly became very rude and disrespectful saying \"if you want to eat in expensive area you have to pay more money\"  Please trust the reviews here and save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal, my snapper fish was perfectly done and well seasoned, coucous and vegetable was delicious as well.   Atmosphere is great, it's a small and intimidate restaurant, one of the better places in the area for sure."}
