{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this little tea house with really no expectations. We live about a half hour away and we're going to Brandywine falls for a little but needed lunch. We searched on happycow for a restaurant nearby. When this spot came up! Not knowing what to expect we parked across the street and came in. It was so adorable, you felt at home once you came in. This little older home was renovated to a little tea house. 

We both ordered the grill wrap which had pea protein/tofu \"chicken\" and a little side of carrot slaw. Then we ordered our sides so a broccoli salad and a regular mixed greens. Lastly we ordered the twin chocolate squares..SO YUM! We also had two green teas iced with lemon, so amazing!

Everything was AMAZING! We loved everything we got. It's so hard to find vegan food and when you find something out in the middle of no where (or what it seemed like to us lol) it's great. 

A vegan treasure!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place with very friendly staff (just don't let them see you using your cell phones at the table or you will be scolded..lol). Great vegan options and delicious tea. I hope they expand their menu or add specials."}
{"text":"The elusive, vegan Twinsburg tea house was well worth visiting. I say elusive because they are only open 11-3 Wednesday through Saturday. They are a fairly new business, so maybe they will expand with more business. 

The owner greeted us with a friendly smile at the front door of the beautiful, re-purposed century home and we got to pick a seat immediately, as well as our choice of teacup. My wife and I ordered small pots of hibiscus and mint teas respectively. At $2.75 a pot, I thought it was quite a bargain as both pots filled our cups 5-6 times! They also serve a variety of vegan and vegetarian friendly small plates and meals. All the pricing looked very fair if not generous. We plan on returning for brunch this weekend. 

Overall, a unique and warming experience!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service in a lovely, homey atmosphere. It's so difficult to find a place that does vegan food well, with so much flavor. Even my non-vegan friends enjoyed and raved about it."}
{"text":"This place has everything I have come to expect in a proper teahouse: renovated historic house full of charm, a large quantity of charming tea pots and cups, variety of tea, and tasty house made lunches and treats.  A group of us stopped in on a Saturday morning and they had a brunch option to go along with the standard lunch menu.  After picking out my tea cup I sadly ordered a tea that was not a good fit for me, meh it happens.  Luckily, my friends are nice and shared theirs with me and those teas were good.  I ordered off the brunch menu and got the breakfast bake, which sadly again was not the best fit for me because it felt more like mashed potatoes instead of hash browns, a texture thing.  I did thoroughly enjoy the scones and lemon cake with blueberry topping.  I feel this place is a good spot with a ton of charm even though my menu choices didn't entirely line up with my tastes that day."}
{"text":"Great food and kind people! Love the vegan/vegetarian options. There's something for everyone! The tea was delicious!"}
{"text":"Well I love anything local so I was excited to see this place when I was home visiting for the holidays. There was no open tables the entire time we were there because it was a holiday week so good to see business is good. My mom and I both got one of their entree salads and tea with lemon loaf and blueberries. Everything tasted delicious and it was such an adorable place to spend time with my mom at. You also get to pick your tea cup and they had holiday ones for Christmas. The cups were also very lite so I didn't feel like I was going to drop the cup everytime I picked it up to take a sip."}
{"text":"Great little Teahouse. Took my mom for her birthday.  I liked how you get to choose your own tea cups.  My mom got the tea sandwiches and cucumber salad.  I had the soup which was a potato and it was good.  They put a dollop of a carrot salad on our plates and that was yummy.  We also had dessert (cheesecake trio) while it was good was it was only three very small pieces, not really enough to share. I will go back another time."}
{"text":"Just what Twinsburg needed! A great vegetarian place. We've met the owner, and the service is delightful. I'm still one of those vegetarians who misses meat, so the fake chicken wraps are one of my favorites. And how on earth do they make vegan deserts that taste good? The brownies are amazing. I hope this place catches on, because there's nothing like it in the area."}
{"text":"We went there on a recent Saturday.   Although I am not vegan I found plenty of things I wouldn't mind trying.   I had a quiche and cup of soup.   They were both wonderful.   The owners and those that served us were wonderful.   I never thought I would like chamomile tea, but I had a pot of apple chamomile and it was wonderful.....highly recommend."}
{"text":"We picked this spot as a quick lunch and by the end wished we had more time.

We ordered a small pot of chai tea, it had a subtle spice that I really enjoyed.  They also have a cart full of cute little teacups that you can pick out.

I ordered the estate pear salad, it was a generous portion that satisfied my craving for a light lunch.  The herb bread that came with it was AMAZING!  So buttery with a nice crisp crust.

My friend got comfortably full from just half the wrap and broccoli salad.

I really wish we had time to grab a little dessert, but that simply gives us an excuse to return.

I did notice they had a little to go meal deal for $12; a half wrap, side salad, herb bread, dessert and iced tea.

Plenty of options, though they are ALL VEGETARIAN, to choose from.  If you're interested in a quaint meal that won't weigh you down I recommend this cute little shop."}
{"text":"Took my grandma and mother in law for brunch today! We had the Royal Tea Special and it was amazing!  So creative and so fun!

Our service was great, the tea was excellent, food was delicious and best of all, we loved picking out our beautiful tea sets! This is a vegan/vegetarian restaurant and all of eat meat so we were a little skeptical but were pleasantly surprised! The potato soup was very flavorful and the scones.... oh my goodness  SO good!

The owner and her husband were so nice. You can tell they truly care about their business and their customers. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was such a find!  The house is beautiful, the menu perfect, the food and tea delicious, and the service wonderful!   I am a gluten free vegetarian, so finding a restaurant that I can eat at can be a challenge.  But this place hit the bullseye!   I will definitely be back -- and soon!"}
{"text":"I came here last week with a friend to try the place out. It's new so we had to check it out. We loved it! Friendly employees, clean place, great location, tasty snacks and amazing tea! I'm not big on tea but wow they have my mind changed. I had the Spicy Indian tea and it was very delicious. They even let you pick out your tea cup to use. It's a perfect place to take your girl friends. Great for young and old. I will be back."}
{"text":"Greenbridge is a sweet little vegetarian teahouse located in a historic century home in Twinsburg. This teahouse is a really pleasant surprise for this side of suburbia! 

My Mom and I stopped in for tea, a pastry and tea sandwiches. We called ahead to make a reservation and came by in the late afternoon.  I loved the raspberry hibiscus tea, which was served to me immediately. We tried several menu items, including the avocado toast and scones. The scones were flaky perfection and the tea had wonderful flavor. I loved how we could pick our own teacup from a shelf of vintage pieces...it was a cute little touch featuring colorful teacups from around the world.

I had such good vibes from Greenbridge.  Our server, Erica, was extremely cheerful and helpful. I felt like I was relaxing at my grandma's house (and I mean that in the best way possible). Everything from the decor to the tea sandwiches felt authentic, homey and simple. The atmosphere wasn't stuffy. Greenbridge is utterly cozy and it didn't feel overpowered by being too stuffy. I'll come back again soon!"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow,only because it was packed. Make a reservation before you go especially during the holiday season. you can pick out your own teacups,i thought that that was very unique. The waiter that served us was friendly and so was the owner. I recomend ordering the broccoli chedder quiche the quiche is  gluten free. The chai tea is great! I loved the whole experience."}
{"text":"This Teahouse, located in a historic century home, is SO cute. It's a struggle to find dedicated vegetarian places around eastside suburbs, and Greenbridge has tons of adorable small plates as well as a few heartier options that make it just perfect for lunch or an afternoon snack. Most menu items--including a couple desserts--are VEGAN! 

There are also vintage teacups to choose from, and the staff is so friendly, patient, and willing to answer any questions. We got to meet the owner and our server, Joanne, was really kind. I wish this place were open longer! The hours are 11-3 Wed-Fri, and Sunday during brunch."}
{"text":"I visited the Greenbridge Tea House this afternoon with my sister, mother, and grandmother. We have visited Molly's Tearoom in Medina several times in the past, so we were excited that we found something similar but much closer to us. As you can see, we were all pretty disappointed in this place.

Pros:
- Chamomile tea was served hot and had a good flavor. We all also liked picking out our own teacups. They have quite a nice collection.
- We all enjoyed the food we got - I had the side by side with herb bread, small mixed greens salad with a really good dressing, and a broccoli salad. I also ordered potato soup on the side, but never received it (more on our service experience below). My family ordered quinoa salad, potato soup, and quiche. The soup was just OK, but everything else was pretty good.

Cons:
- Not a huge selection of tea or food options. Everything is vegetarian here, which was fine for us, but we were hoping for some more options.
- You must ask for a cup of water. I get it, you want people to buy the tea. But my entire family kept hoping we'd have water served with our meals, but only my sister got a glass after asking for it. Other restaurants give everyone water without prompting and most people would enjoy having water + another beverage with their meal. We told the male cashier/host about this when paying our bill, and he said, \"oh, you're not the first to suggest this. Many others have too, but the boss says people won't order tea if they all get water.\" Umm, not true for everyone. And so what if they don't order tea, it's all about catering to the customer needs (we're the ones paying for this experience & meal!).
- Service was AWFUL. I don't remember our waitress' name (older, short blonde hair) probably because she wasn't ever there to check on us. She did well at first with getting our tea and food orders, but after the food arrived, she completely forgot about us. We sat at our table with empty plates for at least 15 minutes and not once asked how the tea or food was or if we needed anything (WATER!). When she did start clearing off our table, we asked to see a dessert menu. We all wanted to order a dessert because they all sounded good. Unfortunately, another 15+ minutes went by and she never inquired about what dessert we wanted. My grandmother actually had to stop her while walking by to ask for the check. She said, \"you didn't order dessert.\" We said, \"we know, but we ran out of time.\" She just said \"sorry\" and walked away. We got our bill dropped off and she told us to pay up front. The male host/cashier was baffled that we only had 1 bill and kept saying \"that's it?\" (Well, yes, that's it, and it could've been more if we were able to order our desserts!). He also had a heck of a time cashing us out. Maybe the gift certificate + cash threw him off? I don't know, but it took a solid 5 minutes just to pay. Just a bad customer service experience overall. (We went to Dairy Queen for dessert and actually got better customer service there.)

Will we return? Probably not. Although this location is closer than Molly's Tearoom, the service and food/tea options are much better. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but until something changes in the customer service here, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. I went with my best friend for lunch. The atmosphere was cute and quaint.We got to pick out our own tea cups to enjoy their variety of teas. The food was very good. I would definitely recommend this place, but call ahead on the weekend just to make sure you can get in."}
{"text":"I came here with several members of my tea group. We enjoyed it very much. They serve fair trade, organic teas and had a nice selection to choose from. As a mostly vegan tea house we did not even miss the dairy or meat! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the place smelled delicious. You can choose your own tea cup and the owner brought around samples of the Moroccan mint tea that day, which I had already decided to order. I ordered a bowl of the golden mushroom and potato soup with thyme because it smelled divine. It was as delicious as it smelled. For my entree I ordered the quiche in a \"crustless' version with eggs, Swiss cheese with onions and chives (not vegan but oh so good). A vegan version is also available.The savory quiche hit the spot (I especially loved the side of garlic bread), and I chose the broccoli salad, which was made with sunflower seeds, sweet onions and a vegan mayo base, as my side. I enjoyed it a lot. My friends raved about the desserts. We look forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu."}
