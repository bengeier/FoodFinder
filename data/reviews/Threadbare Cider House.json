{"text":"Spent a family friendly afternoon touring, sipping and tasting with my kids.  Threadbare has something for everyone!  It's cheery and cozy and the staff is wonderful!  Pizza is pretty darn good too.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We are such fans of Threadbare.  Their cider is yummy.  Their Roasted Apple Pizza is addicting.  Their meat and cheese platters are both awesome, with quite a variety on each platter.  Their staff are ALL very friendly and welcoming.  They hold very cool special events.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"We went to Threadbare for a group event with 20 people. We set it up with two month notice and they were super accommodating. For food, we got a variety of pizzas and ordered a variety of bottles of cider. Staff was awesome describing the different cider varieties and bringing the pizzas out at a great pace to keep everyone going. Favorite pizza was the mushroom but they were all awesome. Favorite bottled cider was the farmhouse (favorite by the glass was Laphroaig-esque super-smoky cider).  Definitely do the tour if you can!!"}
{"text":"I recently hosted a surprise 30th birthday here and I could not have picked a better place to have it!  We had reserved the private room which comfortably fit our 30-35 guests.  Everything about it was fantastic.  The staff went above and beyond to make the party run perfectly.  The pizza and drinks were fantastic also!  Will definitely recommend this place to others.  Thanks again, Threadbare!!"}
{"text":"A group of us went on Saturday around 5pm. As non-native Pittsburghers it was a little hard to find at first, but thankfully there is a huge parking lot. My husband and I each ordered one of the cocktails, but there was a mistake and the server brought him a cider instead. It was very loud inside and she offered to get him another, but he just kept the cider. We had other issues with servers getting confused with drinks, which may have been the noise level or because it didn't seem like tables were assigned to specific servers. Otherwise, everything was really wonderful! We had the pickle plate and the cheese plate and enjoyed both. We also tried a few of the ciders and cocktails, all of which were really great! I would definitely like to go back and try some of their pizzas."}
{"text":"This new and upcoming Pittsburgh place is a great addition to Troy Hill. Brought to you by the same people who make Wigle in the burgh, this is their dabble in ciders. While most of the ciders left me underwhelmed (Good, but average) and the menu lacked a bit of variety, their homemade pizza paired with cider was another story. I highly recommend the roasted apple pizza. It was amazing. They also have gluten free and vegan options, as well. They also make homemade crackers using product from the cider and they are SO GOOD.   Every Saturday, there are family tours and regular tours. They really strive to be a place kids WANT to go with their parents, and a place parents want to be. The tour is interesting and gives some history behind their product.   All in all, I look forward to going back and enjoying more munchies paired with a drink.   HOURS: Open Wednesday - Sunday including Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"I got hooked on cider when I spent a summer in England, so I had to try this place. So many things to love!   We came at 5:00 pm, which was happy hour, so it was $2 off cider. I tried the rose cider first, which was my favorite because it combines my favorite wine with cider. Win win. Then I tried the northern spy, which was a drier cider with citrusy notes. Also delicious!   We ordered 2 pizzas-the apple and the margarita. The apple pizza was my favorite-apples, red onion and cheese with a garlic/oil sauce and a thin, crispy crust. We ended with the oatmeal chocolate cookie-soft, warm and gooey with a slight crunch.   Our server Ben was awesome! He mentioned he was new, but I wouldn't have known otherwise. He was very knowledgeable about the different types of cider.   Threadbare has a nice indoor space with plenty of large tables with bench seating for larger parties, and there's a huge outdoor area-partly uncovered and also a covered tent area. The parking lot is huge, so there's a good chance you'll be able to park here, which is awesome because it's so close to the city.   Tours can be scheduled online-both family-friendly and adult only tours. I made sure to book one for next weekend, and I'll definitely be back to try more ciders. I bought a few bottles of the rose cider since it's new and will likely sell out soon. It's a must-try!"}
{"text":"My wife, who is celiac, attended a brunch ordered the gluten free pizza and was given a wheat pizza by mistake.  She became ill.   If your celiac please double check.   The staff was very apologetic and truly sorry.   Other than mistake with food she really enjoyed the cider house."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! I knew this place was a cider distillery, but I appreciated their food as well. Threadbare Cider House suddenly pops up in the middle of a random road, a big sign leading you to slow down and stop in their spacious parking lot. Once you get there, you can see the lights welcoming you from the top of a staircase located at the back of the lot. Their space is split between a store-like area where they have a bunch of their cider bottles displayed, a bar with seating, some tables, and some communal picnic tables.   The server told us to just pick a seat, and we started looking over the menus. Me and my friend ended up picking the Farmhouse Cider and the Dry Hopped Cider as our drinks, and for food got The Curd (a cheese plate) and built our own pizzas with the classic crust.   First the drinks arrived, and after trying a sip of each I was already happy that I decided to come here. The Farmhouse tasted like what I imagine a fresh cider would taste like but better, and the Dry Hopped one had a more distinct scent and lingering aftertaste which my friend really enjoyed. I really wish I had gotten the flight to compare between 4 ciders, because the difference between the two was a lot more than what I had expected and made me curious about the others.  As a cheese-lover I thought the cheese plate was amazing! I enjoyed how they picked cheeses that were delicious with the thin apple slices that it comes with. I would order it again!  When I saw the pictures of the pizzas on Yelp, I didn't expect much from them. Even when the pizzas came to the table, I still didn't think it looked like a pizza I would like. But after I took a bite, I was ashamed that I had judged it based on its looks. Although it's a thin-crust, it's still a very substantial crust with both crispiness and chewiness. And even though I thought the ingredients looked small, they definitely packed a punch in terms of flavor. I loved it!  Overall, I would love to come back here to try more of their ciders as well as their cocktails!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I know I didn't do this place justice because I didn't try any of the cider. However I did have the roasted apple pizza, which likely would have paired well with a great cider. The crust is thin but not too thin, quite delicious. The pizzas are each fired up fresh and the ingredients taste very \"direct from the farm\", by that I mean, it's a pizza that you can almost eat without any sense of regret not greasy and very fresh. The staff is very pleasant and the ambience is great. This place is a little bit off of the beaten path and not the easiest to find but parking is a breeze since there is a decent size lot. I am not sure I would be back as someone who is not a cider lover, personally, but the options, low key ambience and freshness might be a health conscious cider lovers dream."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I bleed Arsenal. But hear me out. I went to Imbibe Northside a few weeks ago and sampled one or two Threadbare ciders. They weren't memorable, they were warm, just not very thrilled. So when my LDI cohort hosted a fundraiser at Threadbare to raise money for Leadership Pittsburgh, I tried to bail. I'm glad I didn't!   First, super awesome for Threadbare to open up to nonprofits for fundraising efforts. Our group got a percentage of the sales for the night. It is easy, and a great open space. And parking!  Now the spirits and grub. I tried the cider sampler. For me they were huge hits or lukewarm misses. The hits- Farmhouse and Dry Hopped. I took a couple of bottles home with me. Great work on those. Farmhouse is sweeter/fruity, Dry Hopped is an odd sounding but delicious combo of cider with a hint of beer? Sounds weird, it's great for a beer lover like me. I wasn't a fan of the dry. Just personal taste. The Perry (pear cider) was solid. I also had the pepperoni pizza. It kind of looks like it will be a chewy cardboard pizza. Do not be deceived! It was awesome. I will definitely be back for the pizza alone.   So, will this drive me away from Arsenal? No. But I'll tell you what, the pizza and Dry Hopped will bring me back."}
{"text":"Good food and a good selection of ciders. Our group sampled quote a few ciders, but the clear winner on the evening was Oaked & Wild. There where some sweeter ciders, a few dry, and a couple effervescent.  The server was attentive, and he even brought over a small sample of the Rose cider for us to try.   We enjoyed the very tasty food notably the stinging nettled  This is an especially fun place to take a group."}
{"text":"Only live 1.5 miles away but finally tried Threadbare when they offer a gluten free brunch.  Polenta pizza was delicious, salad was also excellent.  Their ciders are very dry.  Most of the time I don't like sweet ciders but I think their sweetest one was my favorite.  Wait staff was excellent, very gracious after I spilled my 1st cider.  Atmosphere is very relaxed, although only 1.5 miles from home, I felt loved like I was in Portland, OR."}
{"text":"It's important to support local places, right? If you like Wiggle Whisky, you will LOVE Threadbare!  Tucked away in Spring Hill on the Northside, this place is amazing. We walked in an immediately felt at home. There are four ciders, and you should start with the flight. I love the farmhouse, personally. All cocktails are made with Wiggle products.  Enjoy one of the meat, cheese or brine platters to start and then you must have a pizza. We recommend the roasted apple for sure.   Ask for Jay and the Pickle Back!"}
{"text":"Cool place. They have a great beer selection for those of us who don't care for cider. Wish they would do more with their whiskeys for cocktails. Most of the cocktails had their cider as a base but I suppose it's a cider house ;-) We got the cheese board and split the apple pizza. Cheeses were spectacular and the pizza was one of the better pizzas I've had in Pittsburgh.  Will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere/decor, amazing staff, delicious ciders and cocktails!   Like Wigle (same owners), the staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable about everything they offer! Christen was a great tour guide with high energy and was able to answer any questions we had. We stayed for a cocktail and beer (yes, they serve local beer, too!) after the tour. I am a fan of the Farmhouse Cider! We will definitely be going back! Even if you don't like cider, they have a nice cocktail list (using wigle products) and a good craft beer selection!"}
{"text":"So, I'm super torn about the reviews on this place, but I have to go middle of the road for now.     So I went the first time with a Yelp event.  They did a fantastic job with this event and I loved the place.  I even took home some bottled cider to offer up for Thanksgiving.   In the meantime, I went back with some friends for a non-Yelp event visit.  Again, I loved the cider house and enjoyed my pizza and cider.   The décor is cute and welcoming, the service is fast and friendly.  Overall, pretty great.  So why the three star review?   Well, while I LOVED the dry cider I was served at the establishment, I HATED the bottled version I took home.  The two tasted nothing alike and no one drank much of the bottles I brought.   And that got me to thinking.  The same thing sort of happened at the Yelp event.  We were served a cider (a barrel aged one, if I recall correctly) that varied pretty significantly even at our table.  The first tray of glasses that came around had enough for all but two of us.   The other two were served the same cider, but from a different tray a moment later.  These two ciders did not taste alike, though I sort of wrote it off at the time because I didn't dislike either one.    At the end of the day, consistency counts.  I realize that the hand-crafted nature of their products lends itself to some variation, but the differences are a little too broad for me."}
{"text":"The Threadbare Cider House seems to be a work in progress. The ciders are pretty good, and I enjoyed sampling several. But I also ordered an asparagus pizza to go with the cider and unfortunately that didn't impress me. The crust was excessively tough and also bland. And the toppings, while creative, really didn't work well together. They include asparagus, preserved lemon,  shiitake mushrooms and parsley. The lemon was frankly overpowering, and the asparagus didn't add anything since it was just dropped on the pizza raw. If for instance the asparagus were lightly stir fried in olive oil and garlic before adding it to the pizza, it would have had a better consistency and compatible flavor. So go for the cider, it's worth it, but let's hope they step up their game in the pizza department."}
{"text":"Good spot for the whole family - we went with 3 generations. They have a great selection of ciders all made in house. They are all very unique and interesting. The pizzas are really good, if a tad expensive, and the ciders are the perfect paring. They also have craft brews on draft (most, if not all, are local) and some board games to play."}
{"text":"Attentive, friendly service and delicious cider cocktails warmed up a chilly Friday night. The cider house is beautiful and has a casual, inviting vibe. As the floor was busy, we snagged a seat at the bar where we sampled the three ciders on tap with a cured meat board before diving into the cider cocktails: a spin on a sazerac and a flipped whiskey sour with a cider float. The beer selection was solid to boot! Three bartenders and whom I assume was a manager attended to us consistently and even comped some food and drinks when our pizza didn't arrive in a hurry. Looks like tours are available as well. #kitsburgheats"}
{"text":"Thank you Rachel and Meredith, Mark, Audra and Jay! What an informative tour! Your enthusiasm is contagious and I cannot wait to bring visiting friends here in the future. I love the way Threadbare has incorporated the history of Johnny \"Appleseed\" Chapman and stuck to our western Pennsylvania roots. I enjoyed all three of the ciders we tasted and settled on the Farmhouse to purchase. I also appreciated the local beers on tap and look forward to trying the Full Pint collaboration. Great Yelp Event!"}
{"text":"We went here within about a month of them opening.  I am a big fan of Wigle and I have been anticipating this for about a year. I ordered the tasting flight of 3 ciders. The ciders were decent but not great. The best one was the farmhouse cider. For food, we ordered the butcher board. The butcher block was tasty but a bit on the light side for the price. The pizzas looked good.  We will definitely be going back given that we love Wigle and like supporting the local distilleries and breweries. Parking was really easy since they have a parking lot. The ambiance was also nice. It was a very open communal space."}
{"text":"omg the best place in america! everything & everyone that is threadbare is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of hard cider.  I have been drinking it for many, many, many years, and am also a big fan of Johnny Appleseed.  I love reading (and listening) to Michael Pollan's book/audiobook, \"The Botany of Desire,\" especially the chapter on John Chapman, and I even visited the Johnny Appleseed historical site in Ohio.  I also purchased some of Wigle's \"Walkabout\" whiskey, in the past which is flavored with apples, and features the old threadbarren guy himself on the label.  Unfortunately, I did not love the cider here at Threadbare.  I prefer sweet and aromatic ciders (skrumpy), not dry and fancy apple champagne (My favorite commercial brand being J.K.'s Farmhouse Ciders from Michigan).  Even the \"Farmhouse Cider\" here was not very sweet, but it was my favorite of the four.  Second favorite was the hopped cider, but it didn't compare well to my favorite commercially made hopped cider, Wyndridge \"Crafty Hopped Cider,\" which is really hoppy and delicious, not dry.  I didn't care for the pear cider either.  I would rather have a Magner's Pear (from Ireland) or a \"Grizzly Pear (Pears not Bears)\" from Blake's Hard Cider Co., also out of Michigan.  Now onto the food . . . we attended the \"Owl Cafe\" special event, which was advertised as having lunch with an owl . . . well, the owl had a private room, so we didn't actually lunch with her, but we did get to see her after we ate (She was a Great Horned Owl, and her name was Martha).  My wife and I split two polenta \"pizzas\" (she is gluten free).  I had the \"Threadbare Hash,\" and she ordered the \"Roasted Apple,\" and we told our server we were going to split them.  While the \"pizzas\" were cooking, my wife and I decided to get up and play with the two life-sized Lite-Brites that they had up against the wall (something we were really looking forward to playing with, as we are children at heart and love toys and games).  Little did we know, until we started trying to use it, is that the design was pre-made, and you were not able to make your own designs because of the way it was crafted, the big pegs do not fit in the small holes, so there really is no creativity nor imagination involved here, you must follow the pattern.  I really don't know why someone would go to all the trouble to make a life-sized Lite-Brite, and then make it practically unusable . . . this was the biggest disappointment of the day (sad face with big pouty lips).  Our polenta \"pizzas\" arrived, served on a wooden pizza paddle, and it was nice to see that they were cut into slices and were already mixed and matched for us, but they were unevenly distributed, so my wife actually ended up with more hash, and I more apple, so we had to move some pieces around in the end (great concept however).  The food was tasty, but the polenta was much too salty.  Also, I would've liked to see salt & pepper on the table, as I thought mine could use a little more pepper (and perhaps grated cheese).  I could taste the herbs really well however, especially the sage, so other than the saltiness, I enjoyed the flavor palette of both \"pizzas\", and the egg that was served on the side was perfectly cooked.  Next time I come back, I want to try one of the regular pizzas, as the people eating them next to us, said they were really good, and they looked delicious.  After lunch, we traveled down the ramp to a back room where we got to see the owl, and talk with some good folks from the Humane Animal Rescue league, and that was great.  They had some hands-on activities, and we were also able to make a cash donation to the cause.  Afterwards, we were expecting to take a tour of the production facility, but alas, no tours were being offered today (another disappointment for me).  So overall, my first visit here was a bit of a let-down in some areas, but I have to say the service was excellent, and the facility was beautifully designed and decorated.  I plan to come back again sometime in the future, and give them another chance, so I am rating them an \"A-O.K.\" for now, and will hope for the better on my next visit (and hopefully the next time I come, there will be tours offered, as well as a sweeter cider).  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Such a fun and casual atmosphere! There are large farmhouse style tables and benches as well as a small bar for seating.  A few of my favorite things about the room were the fun murals on the wall (including the bathroom wall) and the giant light bright in the corner.  I may technically be an adult, but I will never be too old to play with a light bright!    We tried the Cider flight to start.  It was nice to try their 3 ciders as well as a beer from their beer list before deciding on one to stick with.  My favorite cider was the dry cider, but the others were tasty too! I tried the Good News cocktail because it had the dry cider in it as well.  The waitress was really nice and warned me about the taste of absinthe in the drink before I ordered.  The cocktail was good and had a very herbal taste to it, but I think I prefer the dry cider alone.  I think this place would be an awesome place to meet up with friends for drinks day or night!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's a great place! There's communal seating and bar seating and the atmosphere is very chill and friendly.   The cider is pretty good. My favorite is probably the most unique of the bunch: the wild/sour cider. The featured mixed drinks are also very lovely.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't also grab some food here. Their pizza is bomb. They can accommodate for gluten free and vegan as well."}
{"text":"Wigle is definitely a movement beyond Pittsburgh, PA. Threadbare cider and meadery is a great addition to the Wigle family. The cocktails were pleasantly sweet and as I was here for an event this place was packed with people but I didn't feel trapped. I enjoyed the Capri Sun cocktail that was half Capri Sun and half rum. Also their brunch menu is all types of amazing. Some highlights were how well the service is here. The employees are effective, polite, and well versed in the menu items. I went with a classic cheese pizza and it was not your basic pizza and Threadbare does nothing basic. If you get the chance, do go on one of their tours as the lower floor is awesome as this is where the magic happens."}
{"text":"We took a group of CCO volunteers for snacks and a tour one Saturday afternoon as a thank you celebration. I would definitely recommend it.   The historic building and fun facts they shared on the tour were intriguing and it was fun to taste 5 different samples along the way.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were mostly dry not sweet!  The Staff were friendly, accommodating, warm, and attentive. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"What a delight! Wigle Whiskey has a new endeavor to make cider which is in their words \"Pennsylvania's Wine\". This idea started after finding out that Johnny Chapman or Johnny Appleseed has some ties to the Pennsylvania area. Neat right? So Threadbare Cider is housed  in a warehouse that was built around the time of the Civil War. It could have been torn down and a new modified warehouse built but instead the owners wanted to preserve some of the history of the area and just remodeled. And can I say, it is beautiful inside. It is warm and welcoming and fun. There is a large parking lot outside and steps that seem daunting, but for those who cannot do steps there is a way to get inside from the upper street level, which is something I was worried about. The colors and decorations throughout Threadbare are on point. You cannot ask for much else. And the name, it comes from the idea that Johnny Appleseed was often seen in threadbare clothing with no shoes on. Tying it all together!!  Threadbare offers tours and you can even go down to the lab to see how the yeast is fermenting and how the different types of cider are being made. Super neat. The lab was my favorite spot. That is where the employees are trying to find the best ways to mix and make the cider that they sell above in the tap house. Neat right!  Ciders: Farmhouse Cider. Crisp and refreshing!! I would get this one again!  Wild Cider. This one was a bit sour and it was not my cup of tea. But I did give it out to some of the people at my table and they seemed to really enjoy it.   Pizza: Classic crust pizzas or polenta crust pizzas for those who are gluten free. Awesome right?? They also offer cashew cheese for those with a dairy allergy.  I tried the polenta pizza. It was really good, and the polenta was made in house. The only thing is that the pieces did break down a little easier than what I am normally used to with polenta. Still good, but maybe it could be fried at the bottom a bit so that the polenta keeps it shape.   Roasted Eggplant: Roasted eggplant, fennel, cayenne, honey, mozzerella. This one watch out for. It is too good to put down. I loved the tasted of the roasted eggplant and the cayenne really made it hit the spot. I did not tasted the honey so much, but I was not watching out for it. Maybe next time I will be able to tasted it a bit more.   Spicy Tomato Brunch Pizza: Carmen peppers, blush onions, sunny side up egg, cilantro. Good, but the egg kinda threw me for a loop. I liked it but I don't know if I would order it again. I think the crust has to be more in order to dip the yolk. If not it is just a lot of wasted yolk!  Broccoli Pizza: Preserved lemon, truffled pecorino, brie, mozzerella, sun dried tomatoes. Ok, this was one of my favorite. The lemon was a powerful and interesting choice for the pizza and it can be really tasted. The sun dried tomatoes are always a favorite of mine, and broccoli! YUMMY!!   I liked this place and I think that it fits in with the changing scene around Pittsburgh. Another cool place to hang out with some friends. Get a tour, drink some cider, and eat some pizza! Yum!"}
{"text":"You NEED to go to Threadbare! I fell in love from the minute I pulled into the parking lot. The whole outside is riddled with subtle charm, but when you step inside you are truly overwhelmed with how immediately comfortable you feel.  It is so beautifully renovated. They mastered the balance between embracing the character of the past and modernizing for the future. They went to great lengths to preserve the original building and you can tell.  Meredith and the whole staff are such awesome individuals. They are truly doing business right and know what it means to go above and beyond for their customers. Another really cool tidbit is that they've really set things up to be kid friendly so that parents can still go to a fun place for themselves but their kids also enjoy it.  The ciders are seriously special. They don't rely on sweetness but instead embrace the natural sugars as a subtle addition. They have three currently out for tasting and two to buy by the bottle. The Dry is a great champagne-like cider that's crisp and refreshing. The Farmhouse Cider is the \"sweet\" option, but it isn't sweet at all. It is light, airy and fresh tasting - something you could drink for the long haul. The Sour is SO awesome though! It is tart and tasty - definitely my favorite (They plan on having this bottled by Christmas). They also have a pear cider in the works which sounds like it will be fantastic! Since they also own Wigle Whiskey, they serve some delicious cocktails!  Food-wise I've only tried the pizza, but it is truly yummy. The crust is perfectly cooked and I love the creative toppings and pairings, which go really well with all the ciders. The vegan options are also great, laden with cashew mozzarella and plenty of veggies. They also have gluten free pizza which is served on polenta. It is SO good. I absolutely love it. It stands out against the pizza and takes on a life of its own. Along side all of these great pizza options they have scrumptious cheese and meet plates and pickled veggies. The whole menu, brunch, dinner, etc. just looks so good. I would bet everything is awesome with such a great and thoughtful chef at the helm.  I cannot wait to go back, again, and again."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful adventure for a Sunday afternoon. The employees were wonderful and informative... I now will be able to answer conversational questions as to how cider is made and how the yeast works! The cider was delicious! And that includes all 3 varieties tasted. The snacks were yummy especially the cracker like crisps. The various pizzas were very tasty. I will certainly recommend to friends ."}
{"text":"We attended the special Fresh Perspective Happy Hour event Friday night 5:30-7:30. We brought guests from Chicago. Finding Threadbare can be challenging if you're not from Pittsburgh or aren't using a GPS, but once you come upon it you'll be glad to see that it has a rather large parking lot. You walk up a big wooden staircase to enter the building. The space inside is nice & open and we were immediately given instructions for our event, which included a cider, beer or cocktail and free \"appetizers\" which we were pleased to find out was actually every pizza on their menu & their cheese & charcuterie trays. All the pizzas were tasty with nice thin crust, I think we tried everything. The Farmhouse & Dry Hopped Ciders were our faves. We also got to taste bourbon from Rams & Parrots and beer from Harlem Brewing. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their time at Threadbare & we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and simple! Loved it! Ciders were great. Can't wait to see other flavors they will add."}
{"text":"My first impression upon walking inside the restaurant was how cool the details are.  It is obvious they put a lot of thought and love into designing the space.  Threadbare Cider is brought to you by the makers of Wigle Whiskey and is much less than a mile down the road from their space in Spring Garden.  They consider Cider to be Pennsylvania's Wine, which is a fair label, that I will continue to use.  The owner's wanted to bring the history of Johnny Appleseed back to the area and became very well versed in his history in relation to the region.   It is very obvious that the owner's and employees are very passionate about their product.    Most of the seating is tables with benches, but the benches are deep enough to be comfortable.   I was able to try their 3 current ciders - dry, farmhouse and a tart.  I really liked them all, but the dry was my favorite.  It was so smooth, and I'm certain I could drink an entire bottle by myself without even thinking about it.   As for the food - I was able to taste some of the pizza's and they were all delicious.  Their gluten free \"crust\" is a polenta crust.  I thought it was good, but you needed a fork to eat it because it was thick and wobbly.  It just didn't feel like pizza to me.  They also have a vegan pizza option, with vegan cheese, which was good.   One of the fun parts about the place was that they wanted to be accessible to families.  They have a giant lite brite on one wall and even do a kid-friendly tour with activities specially designed for little hands.  I think this is wonderful.   I can't wait to go back and try their Pear Cider when it's ready and have already told many many people they need to get out and stop by."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped over here the place was closed so I was happy to discover they have their own parking lot. It is very difficult to find parking in the Troy Hill neighborhood and although the lot is small it wasn't overly crowded. It sits next to Wiggle whiskey which is the distillery for the Cider house.  You enter by climbing a flight of stairs. On various parts of it says \"News\", \"Fresh from Heaven.\" I came inside and the sign said to sit anywhere. Over to the side is a bar area with a backdrop of Johnny \"Appleseed\" Chapman on the wallpaper. On the opposite corner was a giant \"light bright\" electrical board which I would later learn was operable for children to play with. Since I was here for an event that would follow I decided to forgo the food and settle for the coffee. Before ordering that I was served 3 small glasses of their 3 famous ciders, Farmhouse, dry, and wild cider. The place has free Wi Fi and the passcode is on the wall. I liked the Farmhouse and the dry but didn't care for the wild cider.  Onto the coffee. I was intrigued by the fact that it was \"whiskey\" coffee and recently roasted. They did have some available and for $9.00 you are given a \"French press\" which holds about 3 cups. It was different to say the least but I really enjoyed it. I loved how it came with a small elephant shaped creamer-sorry not for sale. I was told the serve things with animal accessories out of Johnny Appleseed's love for animals. Unfortunately they do not have take out cups so I had to drink as much as I could before they closed before the event.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The gave me a menu to take home with me. I was looking forward to trying the pizzas they have. I had that opportunity later at the event and believe me they did not disappoint. My favorite was the eggplant pizza. They also had a gluten free pizza, and polenta crust to name a few. I saw on the menu they serve brunch on the weekends. Yes you can order your pizza with eggs!  I purchased the Farmhouse cider for my son. Ciders sell for about $18.00 and some whiskey coffee beans to make at home. Everyone made me feel so very welcome here. They accept credit cards and restrooms are near the main entrance. The stairs are lit at night which is always a safety issue for me.  Located on Spring Garden Ave in Troy Hill the easiest way to get there is to take Chestnut St off the 16th St bridge or if coming from the West exit Rt 279 towards Rt 28 and follow the signs to Chestnut St. From there drive a couple of blocks and make a right onto Spring Garden. This route avoids have to deal with some of the steep hill Troy Hill is known for.  Threadbare is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh neighborhood. They are only open Wed-Sun. Weekdays they open at 5. Weekends daylight hours. They offer tours of their distillery and on Sat mornings family tours are offered. Check online for pricing and availability."}
{"text":"I keep thinking about their dry cider... Because they say it's the champagne of cider. Seriously, it is so good. I hate a super sweet cider and feel like a lot of offerings out there are sweet. This is dry, but not tart, just the right combination of deliciousness in my opinion. There's also a hopped cider, so I know you hops lovers will dig this.   This is actually in addition to the Wigle Whiskey brand and right down the street from their barrelhouse. The venue itself is awesome for so many reasons. There's large picnic tables that overlooks the main production area. I love that they always offer an educational component, and offer tons of tours. They even have a fun little kids area. One of the biggest pluses in my book, lots of parking!   Maybe the other plus is the pizza! I'm loving the spicy pepper pizza and surprisingly good is their polenta gluten free pizza. The crust is made of a thick polenta and it's fantastic and totally holds up."}
{"text":"The four of us were in Pittsburgh and we accidentally came across this place because we stopped at Wiggle Whiskey in the Strip District, who they have partnered with, who then recommended it!  We started off with the \"Beast\" Platter and the \"Curd\" platter aka a glorious meat & cheese platter! Soooo good! Then we got a flight of ciders, followed by 4 more cocktails. We then made 2 \"build-your-own\"  pizzas. You have the option of all of the toppings for $15. There are 7 different types of pizzas but in my opinion the build-you-own is totally worth it! We will definitely be back!"}
