{"text":"Great pizza. Sweeter style sauce and thin crust. Nothing fancy but good value, good food and good service"}
{"text":"Got a flyer in the main and decided to try a new pizza place just for the opportunity to diversify from our usual favorites.
We ordered a large pizza with  1/2 sausage and 1 dozen wings.
The pizza was ok, not too bad but not worth going out of your way for. If it were in a room I would eat it, contrary to the wings we got.
Then wings were another story. The did not have buffalo wings but rather some kind of sloppy sweetish gloppy stuff out of a car or jar and pored over the wings. The wings themselves were small and far from fresh tasting. These I would never, ever order again.
Three stars for pizza
One and half stars for wings.
So if you are in the area and are hungry for pizza you could go here and be okay. But I know Penn Hills is proud of their many other pizza places that are better if you had a choice."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time using the GrubHub app on my phone. We got delivery- a medium pizza, chicken nuggets and french fries (kids... *eyeroll*), a few slices of cheesecake, a bacon cheeseburger, and some pop. 

Pizza was good, a little stingy on the pepperoni though. The chicken nuggets were clearly frozen, which I expected but still, they were just \"meh.\" My daughter liked them, but she likes anything. Fries were good though- seemed fresh cut and were perfectly cooked. Cheesecake wasn't bad, the bacon cheeseburger was good and they paid attention to my mother's request of \"VERY well done,\" but didn't burn it. Bonus points for that one. 

I'll probably give them another chance because grubhub is so convenient and they're the only place near my house that uses it and delivers, but I won't go out of my way to stop back."}
{"text":"The pizza was so thin, I could have run it through a credit card reader. They were generous with the pepperoni, but really skimped on the mushrooms. Definitely not worth 25 bucks for two large pizzas."}
