{"text":"The Lexus Club is a restaurant within the Consol Energy Center.  You must b e a member or have Club tickets to an event to get in.  

The Lexus Club is a large restaurant that, before hockey games, offers an extremely upscale buffet.  Pricey at around $50 per person.  Well appointed  with dishes you normally would not find on a buffet.  Lollipop lamb chops, Cajun Pork Loin, Prime Rib, Roast Duck, are just some of the things you may find.  Great desserts.  Expansive appetizer and salad choices and a pasta station as well.  

**you must have tickets for Lexus Club, Captain Morgan Club or First Niagara Club seats in order to dine in the Lexus Club**

Synopsis: Pricey to say the least but a flashy buffet you don't feel totally bad to pay $50 for.  Worth trying if you like trying new things and aren't solely a meat and potatoes kinda person."}
{"text":"Pretty sad 

My first visit was better but the bar ruins it completely.  Sure the bar oaf can pour a draft or whip up a rum and coke but he has no talent or class 

Our old fashioned was watered down 

The bartender oaf tried making my margarita in an old fashioned glass 

He had no intent on shaking it either

He took garnish slices and squished them with his bare hands for my margarita... I was horrified and declined the drink. I settled for the $9 bottled wine cooler 

He was so unprofessional and unskilled.  
I saw him dip a glass straight into the ice bin.  That's s no no 

Typical union worker 

Potatoes were undercooked and the bread was cold and hard.  

The variety we had a year ago was not there this time 

The desserts were not special except the record cookies.  Those are superb with album names on them"}
{"text":"First time experiencing the Lexus club and the service is to the nines! Bob, bobby and jack were so efficient the no customer went thirsty! These guys know their stuff and can make a drink! The guy at the door sonny is super sweet! It's always nice to see a friendly face! 10 out of 10"}
{"text":"For the hungry!  Big buffet.  Some great experiments like cabbage and spaetzle.  Attentive staff.  Lost a star for atmosphere (missing) and substandard desserts (whipped sugar in many forms)."}
{"text":"We went before last night's Pens game (got to see the goalies go at it, that was SO awesome!) Reservations are a must!

Buffet style dining with loads of panache and glamor, even for those of us dressed in hockey jerseys (or worse!) A classy atmosphere even though it is a ginormous room for 200 or so, except for the shiny new Lexus car sitting on a platform---really? Ick. 

I believe this is an Aramark catering establishment.
Well staffed, great service. In fact I would give it 4 stars for that, but the food just brought it down. 

What I sampled from the buffet:

ginger-carrot puree--inedible, it was so salty. 

Spinach salad--would have been better if I could add the dressing myself

cheese and meat platter. Meats were cubed beautifully, but the cheeses were displayed whole with very dull knives to chunk off a piece or two. A real line-clogger of a platter. 

Pork Loin Roast, nice and tender

Lamb Stew-meat so tender, had a Moroccan spiced flavor. My favorite savory item.

Baked Haddock- the \"lightest\" entree item I could find, ultra crispy cracker topping (maybe it was panko, I didn't eat with my glasses on, lol) 

Braised purple cabbage with bacon-so so so bland.

Lemon Berry cake- best of show for my dinner. A lemon 2-layer cake studded with cranberries (!) and maybe some other kind of berry too (still no glasses) with a generous lemony frosting between the layers.

Tasted hubby's Tiramisu--a cute little pre-cut 3\" square, all the flavors were there.

I really wish there were a few healthy options to be had, especially in the vegetables! Most were so creamed or sauced or cheesed that I didn't even taste them. Having a few steamed veggies or undressed salads available does not seem like it would be a gargantuan add to the work load of a busy restaurant such as this.

Oh! about the price--($45 per person) dinner for two plus on glass of wine and one beer was $115"}
