{"text":"Tried Anew for the first time with high hopes for an exciting and exclusive night out. Their affordable prefixed menu stands out from the crowd. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the wait staff is knowledgable and kind. Where it fell flat for my party were the items on the menu and the food that came out. We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat. We would rather spend our money somewhere that was more comfortable with larger portions and food that focused on taste and less on fancy cooking techniques (there was a lot of foam) and left us feeling fulfilled."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Price: $$$  It was a rainy day when we arrived, and we were one of the first customers in the house. Anew Table was smaller than what I imagined and it had a very cozy atmosphere to it.  We decided to try the 5 course tasting menu at $65 but skipped the wine pairing. I opted for a cocktail - I believe I tried their Pimm's Cup while my husband decided to save his glass of wine for dessert. We also ordered sparkling water as we always do, and decided to get different dishes when we had the choice to get the widest selection of dinner as possible. The 3- and 5-course tasting menus are all they offer at Anew Table. There is no separate à la carte menu so keep that in mind before visiting. As the restaurant's menu changes constantly, your 3- or 5-course menu will definitely differ from the one I had.   Shortly after ordering, complimentary bread was brought out to start our meal. I don't believe we had any amuse bouches, as I don't seem to have any photos of them if we did. Our server was very friendly - when we told them we were visiting Calgary from Montreal, he was very delighted to tell us that he was also from Montreal! He told us his name and where he used to work, and told us to definitely drop by the restaurant he used to work at and mention his name. Now, I don't remember the name of the restaurant...   Our first plate was a refreshing dish of tomatoes. What I really liked about Anew Table was their philosophy on cooking and its ingredients. They try to source the freshest ingredients that are in season as possible, and its current list of ingredients are available for viewing on their website. This is probably the reason why their menu is always changing!  The plating on each dish presented was beautiful but the serving sizes were a little bit on the small side for me. I would've liked a few more bites of each course, and had we not ordered the 5-course meal, we may have left the restaurant hungry! Each dish was carefully created, and our server explained in depth what each dish was about. There were various flavours in each dish and overall, hubby and I both really enjoyed all the courses.  The service we received during our dinner at Anew Table was exceptional - our server went out of his way to always keep our glasses full and asked how we were doing with each dish. He also checked whether we were satisfied with each of our dishes, and was also quick to clear our finished plates.  We especially enjoyed the 4th plates, especially the lamb! Having it with granola was a definite new experience, one which I really liked. Though the portions of all the dishes weren't on the big side, after having eaten 4 plates, we were more or less ready for dessert. I definitely recommend you go for the 5 course dinner instead of the 3 course.  As for dessert, hubby opted for the cheese plate while I decided to try the sweet cheesecake. Both were really good choices, and we thoroughly enjoyed both desserts! The cheesecake was one of the lightest in textures I had ever tried and the selection of cheese hubby had were all equally delicious. It was a great way to end our dinner.  Visiting Anew Table was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Alberta last summer. Having eaten fine cooking with some of the freshest ingredients, Anew Table is definitely a must recommended restaurant in my books if you're ever in Calgary. Its short menu allows the chef to really perfect each dish to the customer and it really shows! My only disappointment was the rather small portions of the dishes, but at $65 for 5 quality dishes, I suppose the portions weren't too small when you weigh all the costs after all.  Anew Table is a great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or a night out as a group; just make sure to make a reservation beforehand to secure yourself a nice spot. It's a great place for an avid foodie - you're bound to get creative dishes that you've never tried before! The restaurant is only open for dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal here and was pleased to be able to dine at a high-quality set-menu establishment in Calgary.  In a nutshell: 1- The food was excellent.  One (of the five) dishes was unpleasantly salty, and another could have used a bit of citrus to balance the dish, but otherwise it was spot on.  Definitely a cut above most Calgary establishments. 2- They dealt with my allergies seamlessly (I did call ahead to discuss).  This is a rarity in Calgary and will have me coming back.  I cannot say enough about how comfortable this made me feel 3- The plating was absolutely beautiful. 4- I agree with others that the overall meal leaves you full, not stuffed.  I left pleasantly full, but as a small-ish woman, I wonder if others would feel the same.  I wonder if Anew could adopt the practices of 'the Reluctant Chef' in St. John's, Newfoundland, where they ask prior to serving the fifth course if anyone is still hungry...if you say yes, they insert additional courses prior to desert until all appetites are satiated.  A brilliant way to address differing appetites while maintaining the set menu model. 5- the wine pairings were good, but pours were quite small...it looked like about 2 ounce pours.  However, the presentation and explanation of the wines was lovely.  It would be nice to see more generous pours for the pairing option. Overall, a lovely dining experience!"}
{"text":"A New Table is a gem! The concept is a bit unusual and you can choose between the 3 or 5 course-fixed-price menu, with or without wine-pairing, and it changes daily.  The chef is exceptional. All the meals are beautiful, flavorful, and I felt that a lot of creativity is put into them. Each of our dishes was absolutely perfect. The servings are not large by some Canadian standards but I believe it's fine and very satisfying, in particular for fine food.  The service was excellent. Kristie was extremely nice and informative about the menu. It's one of the best gastronomic restaurants in Calgary but yet still affordable. I highly recommend A New Table if you seek a delicious gourmet dinner."}
{"text":"This small highly polished gem sits quietly in Garrison Woods. A touch off the beaten path, but well worth the drive.  The menu at ANEW is short, you need to decide three or five course with or without wine.  Then sit back and be prepared for a delightful evening.  The staff are very knowledgble and present both the food and wine in the a fun and engaging manner.  The food is locally sourced, and highlights field to table and the wonderful preparations that a skilled chef can create.  The atmosphere is casual and relaxed.  Be prepared to be impressed."}
{"text":"I was really conflicted about writing this review because I absolutely love the food here. The quality of ingredients used and flavours are amazing and I have not once been disappointed by the menu yet. If I were to rate the food alone, it would be 5 stars hands down - particularly for the value you're paying ($70 for a 5 course meal). The reason I'm giving 2 stars is for the service. Tonight was the first time I've been served by the older gentleman in the restaurant. Although he was knowledgeable about the menu, his indifference was slightly off-putting from the get go. I noticed he was more friendly with the table beside us and am not sure if it was because they ordered wine (while we did not) or for whatever other reason. However, I am perfectly ok with indifference as long as it ends at that. What I was not ok with was when I asked if our third course could be served a little quicker (as our second course took over 30 minutes to come out), and the response was both incredibly terse and defensive. The reason I was given was that the kitchen was short staffed, however, that did NOT explain why the table next to us (who ordered long after we did) received their second course almost at the same time as us. It was evident that something had been missed with our order, and I was only expecting a kind and rectifiable response (not even an apology) when I brought it up with server. Instead, I was met with derision and a crusty attitude that should have no place in an establishment like this. I do hope this feedback gets back to management because it's extremely unfortunate that a restaurant as good as Anew should be tainted by one server's poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"We went for my husbands Christmas party and had the whole restaurant.  Wow- it was simply perfect.  The service was seamless and every course was excellent.  Nothing else to write - no complaints."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night for their 5 course tasting menu. My fave are crispy egg -a very well balanced dish and the ling fish -perfectly cooked white fish fillet with delicious sauce and condiments. Overall, I really like their food -the simplicity of the ingredients used yet creating a complex taste in my mouth. Their dishes really show case the chef talent. Their portions are just right. The only negative part in my opinion is ...it took 30 mins in between courses so our 5 course dinner was 2.5 hrs long. It would have been perfect if they could reduce it to 15  mins."}
{"text":"elegant setting with new fusion of food style. It came as 3  courses for 40 and 7 courses for 70. Wine pairing is 28 and 30 each. If you come in with friends, you do have to order the same courses as the others, so it will come in the same time. The food menus are seasonal. For this winter it has carrot, parnish as appetizer, and cod, beef( sirloin), and pork as main courses. And dessert has chocolate mousse and cheese palette($3 extra).  Very good food. Loved the atmosphere!5 stars"}
{"text":"It was my fiancées first meal in Calgary, so we decided to come to an up and coming restaurant. And it did not disappoint! An amazing dinning experience in Calgary! The five course tasting menu was beyond all of my expectations.  All the food was from nearby farms and organic, and you could tell from the flavors! Each course was paired with an exceptional wine that really brought out the flavors of each course. Alex, our server, explained each wine and why it was picked. That really helped tie the meal together.   Since they base each course off of only one main ingredient, they change the menu everyday. I can't wait to come back to try out what the cook up next!"}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing evening of gastronomy. The food and wine pairings were 100% perfect. I drank wine that would have never touched this palate. They were perfect compliments to every dish. One of the most amazing meals I have ever had!! Period... Plan to spend 2.5 hours & order the wine pairings.  We will return!"}
{"text":"First time, had a fabulous experience. Food was excellent, prepared with skill and intent. Wine pairing were bang on. Absolutely recommended - one of my best meals in Calgary!"}
{"text":"3.5/4  ANEW is a gem in the quaint, charactered neighbourhood of Marda Loop/Garrison.  Would I recommend this? Yes - it brings excitement to the Calgary food scene. They use quality ingredients and present the food beautifully. The service is attentive and low-key. The staff are knowledgeable about the wine list. It's a nice venue for date night, a special event and corporate events. I wouldn't bring kids here though because it is quiet.  I love the ever changing menu and the incorporation of local and seasonal ingredients. I also love the location - lots of parking and mere minutes from my home!   I'm rating ANEW for me and my dining buddy's combined experience. My experience was a 4/5 whilst my guest's was a 3/5 - we purposely ordered different selections when there was opportunity to, off of the 5-course chef tasting.  Amazing were the liver parfait and lamb dishes. The liver was flavourful and well balanced with acidity. The lamb served two ways was exceptionally executed. The fattier section was caramelized well and the leg was cooked in such a way to bring out the tenderness and breakdown the tougher tissue. The soup, a veloute was salty and could have done without the nori sprinkle. The nori sprinkle made it overly Asian in undertone and when paired with the French-style soup, was a bit odd. The cavatelli pasta was solid but uninspired. This dish could have done without green onions. The fish, a halibut was over-seared like a browned scallop. It simply took away from the delicateness of the fish. The slice was not very thick so the proportion of browning to poached interior was a bit off. The chicken dish was also lack lustre. It reminded us of Chinese crispy chicken. Not something I want to eat at a French restaurant. Lastly, the cheese dish was fine and standard. I received a Parmesan, Brie and blue cheese with Apple-onion chutney with toasted sour dough. The chocolate pot de creme was too sweet for my taste. I may have enjoyed it as a 3pm snack when I could use a sugar boost."}
{"text":"What a romantic setting. And the food is incredible. With the menu ever changing its a surprise what gourmet delights you'll be dinning on but you'll never be disappointed.  With options of a five course or eight course menu with or with out wine pairings. When we went we requested that just one of us have the wine pairing. And they still provided two glass and shared the single pouring so we both got to sample.  The service was fun and warm too. With an excellent knowledge of what was being served. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Calgary is so fortunate to have such an exceptional restaurant as ANEW Table. It is consistently outstanding! Fine dining at its very best. Its location is convenient (right off Crowchild Trail at 33rd) in Garrison Woods. And not only is the food delicious but it is also extremely reasonable...three full courses for $45!!! Service is also wonderful. Have never met the Chef/Owner but I hope he reads this!!!"}
{"text":"anew Table. Arguably the best Tasting Menu in Calgary. Yes, I'm including the likes of Teatro in this comparison!   anew table is a quiet, approachable restaurant in Marda Loop. The ambiance is unassuming and French, with a smaller staff and without the hustle and bustle of a big restaurant. I've now been here twice, both for special occasions, and I can say without a doubt that this is one of my favourite restaurants in the city.   anew only offers a prix fixe Tasting menu, either 3 or 5 courses. (5 courses will run you $70, +$30 for wine pairing.) This last time I went, I opted to go for 7 courses by requesting both options for main courses and 3rd courses - because why not! While this does upcharge by an additional $35 for two additional courses (which I felt was a bit steep given one was more a starter and one was a main), it was definitely worth it.   They offer housemade sourdough bread and housemade butter, both of which are excellent - and while they do offer you as much bread as you like, I'd recommend saving room for the actual food.   Unfortunately they didn't offer an amuse bouche, which would have really been an appropriate choice for a restaurant of this calibre serving a tasting menu and not that hard to create, I imagine. The food overall was truly amazing though!   They change their menu every day, but it is safe to say that they are consistently excellent with flavour balance and wine pairing choices. All said and done an evening for two ran us $300, but it's worth it for something that you indulge in once in a while.   This is a perfect place for a special occasion, and definitely one of Calgary's hidden gems!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, location and ambiance however our service was a 2 star evening. A rare night out without the kids my wife and I wanted to try this restaurant as we love a good tasting menu with more than 3 courses.    The food was spot on however where things fall apart is what I will call \"service by committee\".  There was one person who seated us, another comes and asks for your drinks, another explains the menu, another ran out the food but we never saw the same server twice. As the courses went on they took longer and longer to come out, our desert never arrived and then eventually server number 3 asked if we were ready for our bill. My response was, 'we have been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting to get someone's attention and I was hoping to order a coffee to have with my desert that hasn't arrived\".  Again, I just find it really strange that no one person is really keeping an eye on your service and the servers are all just scurrying about the dining room. Another glass of wine, an espresso or making sure our next course was ready when we were done with the previous seems like important restaurant mechanics."}
{"text":"Anew Table is chic example of affordable fine dining in a simple tasting menu format.  Each day is something new, hence the name as the chef reinvents the menu daily.  This is fun since you're not going to see or experience the same played out flavors as some restaurants linger on certain profiles.  The textures and beauty of the plates are just exceptional. Smoked lake goldeneye in a foam broth with noisette, herb mayo and luxurious yolk literally sing from the plate. The chicken in the fourth course seared to golden perfection with a spread of zucchini sauce mixes with the crunch of fava beans and meatiness of shitake mushrooms and just leaves you wanting more.  The only problem with Anew Table is just that. You want more. The portions in the five course meal (a seeming steal at $65) are paltry at best. Once they iron out this kink, I think this place will move itself up as being a major game player.   If its appealing to an older generation that favors inventive chef techniques with flawless execution in a humble and cozy spot in Marda Loop, it is sure to please the smaller appetite. But as someone who enjoys leaving with a full belly, I have to admit disappointment.  That said, their wine pairings were bang on and it was a beautiful experience guided by a young but very knowledgeable and exciting chef.  By all means, please go and experience this wonderful restaurant. But do not starve yourself or prepare for a midnight snack."}
{"text":"If you love gourmet food and fine wine, but not getting mired in difficult foodie decisions, you need to try this place.   The creative, outlandishly flavourful food is as well presented as the service. Ask the GM, and one of Canada's few Master Sommeliers, Alex Good, to set you up with a wine you'll love (with none of the snobbery you'd expect from an expert). Now, just sit back and revel in flavour.   I also love that this restaurant uses so many local ingredients. Everything is fresh, since the menu changes. Even the bread is perfect.  This would be a prime place for a romantic date, but affordable enough to do as a treat to yourself at the end of a rough week."}
{"text":"One of the best fixed price menus I've had. We were in on Canada Day and ended up being one of two couples in the restaurant which was pretty unique. The highlight of the five courses was the seared trout with a yoghurt sauce - out of this world good. The wine pairings were perfect too. For the price, I was impressed. Previous reviews about small portion sizes were certain not our experience - I have a large appetite and left comfortably full. Definitely coming back!"}
