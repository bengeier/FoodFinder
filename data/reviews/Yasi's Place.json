{"text":"I did a Google search for a \"kid-friendly brunch in Toronto\", and was completely intrigued by the mention of Yasi's amongst the usual fare.

We were there today.  It was a pretty glorious sunny day, we were in good company and well-armed with snacks for the wee tummies in our group, so we didn't mind the wait on the patio or the wait for the food...it just didn't matter at all because the staff was SO nice, and we felt like we were in a pretty special place.  
The kids (babe & toddler) seemed to tap into the laid-back vibe, and were also pretty okay with the wait.  Our little one, the toddler, was absolutely SILENT and CONTENT when her plate of french toast sticks (on the excellent multigrain bread no less!) with maple syrup for dipping arrived.

I was less silent but equally content with the already-touted Herbie's grilled cheese...and in my cheesy bliss, I don't even remember what everyone else had, but there wasn't much food left on ANY plate at the end of the meal.

Parents take note:  babes sat on our laps at the picnic table, strollers were parked around the corner in the sitting area, and we were in the shade on a gorgeous day.  I'm not sure how comfortable it would be with a restless little one inside or the availability of high seats, etc.

One other plus:  there's a playground with a splash pad just a short walk away..."}
{"text":"I was one of four patrons on Memorial Day morning and had a special special breakfast at Yasi's Place.
Perhaps it was the fresh arugula picked that very morning from the mini garden outside the window, or the two fantastic ladies who did everything from taking my order to preparing my \"scrambled du jour\" (spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, topped generously with goat cheese and served with a side of aforementioned salad, thick, multigrain, grilled toast (yes, grilled) and best home fries i've ever had), to keeping me entertained while I waited at the little breakfast bar. 
Could've been the pick-me-up coffee that didn't burn my tongue on the first sip, or the cozy surroundings, the shirt & shorts salt & pepper shakers, all cooking right in front of me at the breakfast bar or the usuals who just said hello and telepathically communicated their order to the folks who run the place.
It annoys me that I loved this place so much and yet I can't put my finger on why exactly Yasi's place made me feel like I'd dropped by home for nourishment."}
{"text":"I've tried my best to really love it, but I'm mostly convinced that others love it merely because it's one of very few brunch options in the area. The place is cramped, the food is meh. To me, this could aspire to be like Parkdale's \"Mitzi's\", which is also cramped - but the food and staff vastly superior. Been 5 times over 3 years, but I can't see myself returning again. Still, its a nice option in an area void of great food."}
{"text":"Eclectic, interesting, cool.

Yasi's Place, located in the heart of the newly coined \"Junction Triangle\" is a warm mix of hippie, hipster and omg amazing.

This place relaxes my every muscle.  

Bikes of all shapes and sizes pile up outside, just a stone's throw away from a georgeous outdoor patio, which affords the perfect view of the restaurant's stellar interior decor.

Given Saturday's blustery weather, we went inside and were seated at the counter, atop cutesy stools, with a view of the open kitchen

Salad appeared to be on an assembly line, with the plates lined up, ready for addition of a main course to each heaping of greens. Warm breakfast burritos, savory french toast and decadent eggs florentine were doled out in perfect portion size, much to the satisfaction of their eagerly awaiting owners. 

The coffee is fair trade and the grapefuit halves are divine.

Indie music  plays overhead.

This might be my favourite brunch spot in the city."}
{"text":"Some things I really liked:
-For having free range eggs and fancy meat, the prices are really great
-There's a kids menu.  I feel that speaks to the community nature of the place.
-The staff are Actually friendly and nice.  I've only been twice, but both times, the staff was so personable and outgoing, that it makes everything that much better.
-My breakfast burrito was great, and the homefries were Awesome, thickly covered in spices.  Compadre's grilled cheese with bacon + avocado was outstanding."}
{"text":"This brunch spot is a cheerful little place that does grilled cheese right.

Caramelized onions, pesto, avocado... and of course cheddar and multigrain toast.

Cheesy goodness that keeps bringing us back :)
...also the coffee is good.
...and they have cool salt shakers. :)"}
{"text":"Yasi's Place is a small neighborhood diner tucked away in an area east of the Junction. It's a rather 'off the beaten path' of a restaurant as there is nothing around it but residential and a local church. How this place came into existence I theorize that it once was a corner store that had closed down and was later remade into a diner by a few young upstarts.

When you first step into the place you'll feel like you went back in time to the 60's or 70's. The kinda place your mom would've gone to for a vanilla coke after school. It's retro but not in a kitschy \"new-retro\" way, but rather in a more natural time honored fashion. The place is small with a couple of deuces, a few four-tops and a pair of horseshoe counters for seating. Outside is a decent sized patio which, as expected, is in high demand during the summer months. The overall feel of the place is low-key and casual with an eclectic mix of local urbanites. 

I went for breakfast to which the menu offered a standard \"All Day\" as well as an \"Eggs du Jour,\" a \"Notorious Breakfast Bagel,\" \"Breakfast Burrito,\" and  finally a simple granola with yogurt. All breakfast items are vegetarian friendly with meat being optional ($2) for the \"All Day\" and the \"Breakfast Bagel.\" I opted for the All Day Breakfast with Bacon as well as the \"Bottomless cup\" of coffee.

My server was prompt, friendly and the food arrived in a timely fashion hot on the plate. Everything was delicious, especially the homefries which were delightfully spiced much to my surprise and enjoyment. It's worth mentioning that much of, if not all the food served is grown locally and organic. As well the coffee is fairly traded i Deal coffee. The difference in the taste of the food is subtly better and I'm sure you'll be thankful for the extra nutritional value. 

My only minor complaint is that I found the portions on the small side for a $9 standard breakfast. Or that $9 was a tad steep for what I got. Then again perhaps it's me having problems reconciling with the fact that whenever you go to a restaurant that offers anything remotely organic it's automatically going to cost you a few bucks more. I suppose if you don't bat an eyelash at paying $11-$12 for a simple breakfast and coffee then Yasi's place is as good as any. Here's a tip on the coffee: Their coffee mugs are a decent size so you may want to skip paying the extra $1 on a bottomless cup.

I definitely plan on returning to Yasi's Place to try one of their special grilled cheese sandwiches and perhaps the \"better than sex\" brownies. Overall I feel confident in saying that if you are up in the Junction area and looking for some decent grub Yasi's is well worth searching out."}
{"text":"The other reviews hit the nail on the head. It looks like a corner store in the middle of a residential neighborhood, but it's got some of the most delicious veggie 'cafe' eats around. Brunch is the best. I get cravings for those coated home fries. 

There's a unique flair to the menu without being outlandish. When's the last time you had Labneh outside of a Middle-Eastern restaurant? Or even inside? 

Yum."}
{"text":"Yasi's place is my favourite brunch spot in the city.  It's tiny, cluttered, and definitely eclectic, but it's most certainly awesome.  They make excellent soups, which pair well with equally impressive grilled cheese sandwiches.  I'd comment on other dishes, but I find it hard to pry myself away from their sandwiches.  My friends are big fans of the poached eggs, and we all enjoy getting turkish sausages to go with our meals.  The coffee is good, which is another bonus -- plus you can get gritty Turkish coffee if you're in the mood.  This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little restaurant, nestled in the middle of a quiet neighbourhood.  There is a little patio with freshly painted picnic tables, perfect for a group of friends.  Inside, seating is limited but there is a counter for those opting to dine alone.  The decor is fun and the servers are extremely nice and knowledgeable.  

I went there for breakfast and ordered the Black Bean Breakfast Burrito with Tofu (don't fret, it can be made with egg) and unlike any breakfast burrito I have ever had, this one was perfect and didn't leave me feeling sluggish with a pregnant-style belly.  It had avocado spread, tomato, black beans and tofu in a whole wheat wrap.  And for $7.99 you also get your choice of home fries, soup or salad as a side.  I chose the hash browns, which were beyond filling.   

I also couldn't help but try the soup of the day - a black bean and tomato soup which complemented my burrito quite well.  The soup had some kick to it, but it wasn't as hearty as I would have liked it to be. 

Overall, I loved every aspect of this place.  I urge you to try out this little spot sometime for brunch, and bring some pals, cause they'll adore it as well."}
{"text":"Perfect.  Weekend.  Brunch.

It's like they photocopied Montreal's spectacular Cafe Joe and dropped it into a hidden little corner of the city.     It's like they serve hipster catnip or something... place just crawls with interesting, spectacular people.     It's like they figured out a way to keep the place perfectly busy without ever having any lineup...  some crazy computer algorithm or something... predictive variance...  Magic beans...  Whatever.   It's like they can read my mind and my thoughts... Amazing.   This is exactly what I want my brunch place to be.

It's like nothing else in the city.   What a treat."}
{"text":"1/10/12: I'm so very sad that Yasi's Place has closed. Moving to a larger location, perchance?

Really a 4.5 star spot. I'd bookmarked Steph L.'s review because of her mention of grilled cheese with pesto and avocado - YUM! Ambitious to stop here my first morning in Toronto, but I'm an explorer and had never been to Bloordale Village before. Lots of cute row homes and stores with old furniture nearby, and there was a line when I finally got here. Didn't realize I'd picked the cool neighborhood spot for breakfast, but I apparently did. Lucky for me, I was solo and there was room at the counter. 

Had planned on that grilled cheese sandwich but it included an ingredient I didn't like (probably sundried tomatoes). Went with the Florentine-ish instead: eggs Florentine on polenta cakes instead of an English muffin! I was powerless to resist such a choice.There was some unknown ingredient in their Hollandaise sauce that I couldn't put my finger on that tasted very metallic, and that's the reason for the loss of a half-star. The spinach, potatoes, salad with sunflower seeds, poached eggs and polenta cakes were stellar! The meals for take-out looked wonderful, too - all very veggie-friendly. No wonder the word's spread on Yasi's and the wait is long....."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Friendly service and delicious eggs benedict. Nice homey feel too, very down to earth. Even though we lived in the Annex we'd still travel all the way to this neighbourhood to go there. They grow their own lettuce and stuff in the summer, I think, based on the garden plots outside. There are bees in the summer though, so not so fun to sit outside then even if it's gorgeous. The coffee is mediocre, the potatoes can be really good one day and not so good another, the hot sauce is super yummy and did I mention I love the eggs benedict? They also have burgers available, like organic beef and chicken, which are delicious. Definitely worth checking out, it's a great brunch spot and is always busy even though it's far from downtown."}
{"text":"The quiet brown facade of Yasi's Place peeks unassumingly from around the corner of a good friend's house. On a quiet & overlooked block it is much-loved by its regulars, a frequent stop for the artists inhabiting the many studio spaces nearby.

This venue has played host to many crucial hours of bonding over coffee in amusing, mismatched mugs. Their jumble of icons mirrors the non-sequiturs of our lives, and make this cozy little cafe feel very much like home (if your kitchen cupboard looks anything like mine).
 
A small cluster of contrasting table-tops is fun to choose from during the weekdays, fun to stare at longingly while waiting your turn to get a piece of their busy weekend brunch. In its quieter moments, the aforementioned tete-a-tetes can transition into announcements of your personal business to the staff and fellow customers, who you suddenly realize are very much within earshot. 

Yasi's menu offers a very decent selection of sandwiches, wraps and Turkish-inspired breakfast items, all made with uber fresh and organic ingredients, and is very vegetarian-friendly (also offering a few tasty vegan options).

Worth noting: the heavy emphasis on cheese; a whole section of the menu devoted to grilled cheese sandwiches (\"the Cheesy Grill\", as they call it), and consequently a wealth of options in adding/substituting the stuff in other dishes. The choice of bread is also borderline overwhelming (in a good way), all of it delicious, healthy and hearty.

When nearby, I always do what I can to (at least) pick up a coffee and pumpernickel bagel smeared with labne (the middle-eastern, yogurty relation of cream cheese) for the road (or otherwise). But be warned: the laid-back vibe does not a hurried, late-for-work & starving, pit stop make."}
{"text":"Hey everyone, what's for lunch? Come on over to Yasi's Place for your next nosh! \"Yasi\" sounds like the name of your local baker or sandwich maker and the atmosphere is really neighbourhood-y and welcoming. They serve brunch on weekends and Mondays but you can get certain breakfast items anytime. It's a shame they close so early but I imagine this to be the type of place that the neighbourhood freelancers, stay at homes and high school kids come to for a quick and tasty bite. 

Without the power of Yelp I would never have heard of Yasi's Place, much less stumbled upon it in my Toronto travels. It's in the middle of a super residential neighbourhood just north of the super sketchy neighbourhood that touches Lansdowne. 

I ordered the daily special, which was Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus, Wilted Spinach and Goat Cheese. Instead of what I'm usually accustomed to when it comes to ordering scrambled eggs (runny eggs with one wimpy vegetable), this was a veritable vegetable medley! The asparagus and spinach were perfectly sauteed and abundant. I also ordered a yummy soup of the day to split with my brunching parter-in-crime, and it was a vegan Smoky Black Bean and Tomato. I was so torn about what to order that I *also* ordered lemonade. You could tell it was fresh - super tart, tangy and refreshing. Oh, and let's not forget the free individual pots of coffee or tea before 11am.

Finally, how could I resist this menu item that was staring me in the face from the moment I arrived: \"BETTER THAN SEX BROWNIES\". Hell yeah. The brownie was essentially a chilled, ganach-tacular concoction that was so dense and rich I had to pause to make sure I wasn't eating an actual truffle. Absurdly good.

And just to reiterate what others reviewers have rightfully mentioned, the place is tiny, cluttered and eclectic. Lots of cutesy knickknacks, mismatched chairs and picnic tables, vintage salt and pepper shakers and the like!

Cash only."}

{"text":"Yasi's was a great place to rub elbows with leather jackets, tattoos, saggy skin, cardigans, and everything in between. It was amazingly delicious, a great deal, and a pleasure to eat there.

It's now closed. RIP, Yasi's."}
