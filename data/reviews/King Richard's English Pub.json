{"text":"I've had bad service before but never have I ever had NO service at all... Waitress gave us our menu brought water and then we never saw her again! However I could hear her have a great time standing in the back chatting! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've become a regular here.  It's so close to work and they're usually pretty quick in getting the food out. I really like the fish and chips and their salads are great. They never look sad and limp like in other pubs, their ingredients are always fresh. Love the staff. Always a good experience!"}
{"text":"We waited for 45 minutes for our food and when it came my fries were room temp and dried out-I told the waitress, who scurried off and did nothing about it. No checkbacks during our stay at all. Will never return."}
{"text":"Very nice pub experience, from the friendly hostess, and bartender, right down to the owner. Food was very tasty, with good portions. The menu is not the biggest, but it does cover most pub dishes. Good selection of beer on tap.  Happy to have an English style pub open in Aurora. Will be returning to this establishment.  Returned this week to find a new menu. Greater selection, great waitress, owner came by twice to check on us... Felt like I was in a Glasgow pub with the footy on the tube."}
{"text":"This place is close to home and the food was good and the live band was very engaging and lively. However, the service we received the late Friday evening we went was mediocre at best.   My boyfriend and I stood at the door for 10 minutes while trying to figure out if we wait to be seated, and there didn't seem to be any visible staff around in that time frame to ask.  Eventually we seated ourselves and waited another 15 minutes before spotting a server, and as she left a table by us and was walking by, I attempted to ask for a menu but was shortly told \"I'll be back\" and she sped off.   A nice couple at a table close to us who were just settling their bill, must have seen the looks my boyfriend and I exchanged as they said the same thing happened to them, but they are regulars who have never experienced this type of (or lack of) service before.  The food was good, but not enough to make us replace our current favourites.  However, bad service nights happen and I won't hold it against them and would gladly go again when looking for a local place with live music when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, friendly atmosphere, friendly server, but didn't like the food to be honest. Ordered a beef dip sandwich because, when done well, can be heavenly. Sandwich was soggy from the dip being spilled on the plate prior to me receiving it, beef was chewy and a lot of fat. Ordered a gingerale and sent back twice because it didn't taste right and there was a brown substance floating around in it. Fun bar at night -- older crowd though (I'm 20). Live music some nights."}
{"text":"I don't usually order Cobb Salad. But when I do, it's usually very good. Not this time, though. You see, a properly made Cobb salad should contain the ingredients in the mnemonic:EAT COBB: Egg, Avocado, Tomato, Chicken, Onion, Bacon, Blue cheese. It should be arranged on a flat plate with all the ingredients in rows like a beautiful rainbow. This wonderful creation was invented in the 1930's in Hollywood.   The King Richards version of this salad was missing avocado and diced yucky ham was substituted for the chicken. Worst of all it was piled into a bowl on top of a bunch of romaine lettuce. It did not look like a beautiful rainbow. It looked like something ready to dumped into a compost pile. I didn't even take a photo because I never want to see it again. Salads should never make you angry. This one infuriated me."}
{"text":"Met some good friends for a couple of pints,wings and burgers. Lovely time. Excellent service, great food and cold drafts(of beer that is)."}
{"text":"Don't usually go to pubs, as I am not a drinker, but went with friends on their recommendation.  Very impressed.  My wife and I had the liver and onions.  Done to perfection, and the portions were more than adequate.  Very flavourful.  My only complaint was the noise level, but I guess that's what you have to expect from a pub.  Well worth the drive to Aurora."}
{"text":"It was clean is about the only compliment I can give it. It's early on an empty Saturday night, the wait for drinks was a half hour, the wait to pay was 45 minutes. I am writing this as I wait, thinking about the cheap wing sauce on overpriced wings, and the two flat cokes (I'm driving) that I received. My friends feel similarly. We've been watching the multiple waiters text, and drink, and my money is just sitting on the table waiting to be taken. This is probably more suited to Paddy's Pub from Its Always Sunny, but alas, this place isn't fictional. King Richards pub is an embarrassment to all the good local bars. Just avoid and go to Shoeless Joe's next door."}
{"text":"I've been to King Richard's a few times and have always had friendly service and good beer. The bar menu (mostly fried snacks) kicks in somewhere around 9-9:30, so if you're looking for the full menu, make sure you come a little early."}
