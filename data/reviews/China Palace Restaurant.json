{"text":"Ruined all other Chinese food places in the area for me and I ain't even mad. Been here countless times and I have never been disappointed. Sadly I don't think they deliver which is unfortunate on snow days."}
{"text":"Definitely an authentic and delicious Chinese restaurant. Be sure to order off the Chinese dinner menu, as there is a larger selection. Portions here are absolutely huge! You will be stuffed afterwards. Some of my favorite dishes were the tofu with mushrooms and broccoli, the beef soup noodles, and the kung pao chicken. My family enjoyed it so much we stopped by again our our way to the airport."}
{"text":"The food is good here, crowded and noisy but it gets really busy. I normally go here for dinner. My partner loves their deep fried eggplant. The peking duck is not the best, the other dishes are pretty good"}
{"text":"This place was packed on Saturday night but with some reservations managed to accommodate a large group of us. They have a pretty vast and authentic menu and we ordered a bunch of different things that were all solid and had a delightful homemade quality to it. Portions are plentiful too.

My personal favorites were the braised brisket with daikon, the wet beef flat noodles, and peking duck. The peking duck is crisp skinned, not too fatty with tender meat, artfully cut and comes with pancakes and some cucumber. It also comes with a duck bone soup that is very flavorful and refreshing, and that's saying something as I normally don't like soup.The wet noodles come with plenty of gravy, some carrots, little beef and some bok choy but lets face it - when you order this, you just care about the noodles and there's no shortage of that here. And the brisket with daikon is tender and just barely holding together with chunks of daikon that are fork tender. 

They do fried rice fine, albeit unspectacular. Dry fried green beans with ground pork is a large plate of the string beans with some soy sauce spiced ground meat that's quite enjoyable as a palate cleanser. Sweet and sour pork is fried crisp with just enough not gloopy sauce.

A little bit too authentic for me is the fried shrimp with salted egg. The salted egg is a bit too overpowering so I would recommend it only if you really like salted eggs or want to slap some chili oil on it to balance it out.

It's easy to see why this place is so packed so try to get a reservation if you plan on coming.

Update - our family ended up eating here for two more days too, so got to try a few more noteworthy dishes. The shrimp egg scramble is good, a mountain of scrambled eggs with plump shrimp that's nice and light. Their white cut chicken is very well done - clean meat with a vibrant ginger onion sauce. The bbq pork and jellyfish (strange combo I know...) is pretty good too - the fatty extra crunchy pork is a fantastic exercise in culinary delights from taste and textural contrast. They also have this deep fried tofu custard dish that I've never seen anywhere with a sauce and broccoli that is now unofficially my favorite vegetarian dish."}
{"text":"This place is as authentic as it gets.  Went here for dinner on sunday after seeing it on yelp.  We walked in and the place was packed full with large groups of Chinese families around big tables. We were not chinese but they made a special table up for us. The hostess was awesome.  Needless to say the food was excellent and inexpensive.  The same dinner back in L.A. would cost triple what we paid and not taste as good."}
{"text":"I've had the deep fried tofu with salted egg yolk batter. Deep fried tofu is amazing, as silky smooth as you can get it- a definite sign of good technique and good quality tofu. Dau Mew (snow pea leaves) is on the menu but the last few times I've tried to order it they were out. This time around I tried the 7 spice short ribs, unfortunately this dish was uninteresting and bland so I would give it a pass. Since they were out of snow pea leaves they did up some chinese broccoli in garlic sauce for me. Again technique shines through - vegetables cooked perfectly with a nice balance of garlic all around. Service the last two times have been efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"We were in Calgary 2 weeks ago to start our journey to Banff and Japer.  One of our friends always look for Chinese restaurants no matter where he was (including Spain, Germany).  I found this place by searching through Yelp.  We had dinner here the first night.  We were pleasantly surprised by its menu.  It was comprehensive and has a lot of unusual dishes that you won't find in most Cantonese restaurants in NJ/NY. Naturally we picked the ones we don't get at home.  They were all very good and in giant portion.  The day we returned to Calgary to depart the next day for NY, we went for dinner here again.  This time we ordered the crispy duck.  The pancake was very good and authentic.  But the duck is a little bland and the skin was not crispy. The price was very reasonable. I would have given it a 5 had the dishes been a little more salty.  It was little bland for my taste.  But I was glad I didn't detect any MSG which I am allergic to."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant for our New Year's dinner.  We thought it would be Golden Princess but it's now changed ownership and it's called China Palace.  

We managed to get 1 of 2 tables left as we didn't make a reservation for dinner.  We ordered the Peking Duck 3 course special, a special vege/pork/bamboo shoots/dry scallops dish and a steamed tofu dish with little anchovies and cut-up chillies in an oil/soya sauce.   The Peking Duck special consisted of the duck and wraps, duck tofu soup and fried rice with duck pieces.  Great authentic Chinese food!  

I must say, though, better make a reservation.  The restaurant was hopping.  All big tables - all full up!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before for their stir-fried rice/noodle, congee dishes and they are one of the better ones in the NW (Shanghai Palace is also great).  This time I ordered a specialty dish called Poon Choi to ring in the Chinese New Year with family and friends.  They seem to have this available around CNY on an annual basis and Poon Choi is a traditional Chinese dish for special events.  You basically call in and pre-order a day or two before you want it and when you arrive you pay for the food and also leave a $20 refundable deposit once you return the pot.  I ordered the six person version (smallest available) which cost $200, there is also a larger version available for more $$$.

In the dish there was abalone (6 small pieces which are counted when you pick up your food), roast duck, chicken, lobster balls, shrimp, dried scallops, Chinese mushroom, taro, pork belly, fat choi, fish cake, fish balls, sea cucumber and braised radish.  On the side they provide a container of thick, rich sauce which you pour over everything when you are ready to serve.  The idea is to put the pot on a portable stove set to low at the middle of the table, pour the sauce over top and each person has a bowl of rice to accompany the food and you dig in family style.

The food was good in general considering the variety.  It is understandably difficult to get everything right, but overall it was tasty.  A few people thought the protein to veggie ratio wasn't good and they cheaped out (everything was propped up by lots of radishes and braised veggies).  But they are one of the few places in Calgary that do this (I think I found about five other Chinese restaurants that offer this), so props to them and considering it's a special occasion dish with some expensive ingredients it was worth it to me.  

This is also available for dine-in customers, however you still need to pre-order ahead of time (and probably want to make reservations anyways).  As mentioned, this is only available around CNY time."}
{"text":"Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing, but their food was bland and had a LOT of MSG. 

We ordered beef with broccoli, fried pork chop, and chicken fried rice. Nothing really stood out as being \"good\". Just a good solid \"meh\".

We won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese restaurants.  Their dishes are fresh and don't leave you with the dreaded greasy food syndrome after.

They are quite busy in the weekends so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food, staff is very friendly and helpful. We are regulars here."}
