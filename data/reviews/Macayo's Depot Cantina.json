{"text":"First time and definetly Not the last! Attended my friends 21st birthday parlay and let me tell you food was on point, to top it off our server Cam  was a delight to have serving us with great customer service! Thanks for the great experience!!!!! #YUMMMAYYY!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, nice location and great live music.  I ate there twice over a long weekend.  Definitely visit there next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were sat quickly and in a booth. Our drink order was taken almost immediately. Took a while to place our food order. The chips and salsa weren't great. Overly greasy chips and the salsa was more of a from-the-jar and not homemade. Our food was good. Huge portions so we had plenty to take home. It took a long time to get drink refills...but I think our server was new as he seemed way overwhelmed. I'd return if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"This is my dad and I's go to spot for Mexican food. You definitely get a good amount of food for what you pay for. We always leave feeling stuffed and with leftovers. We had a new waiter tonight named AJ that I've never seen before, it was crazy busy tonight so I don't blame him for a couple mistakes here and there. Other than that he was great and super cute. I wanted to put my number on the receipt but I was too much of a wimp lol"}
{"text":"Classic Tempe location should not be confused with quality food. Bad chips, chicken cheese crisp was mostly salt, guacamole tasteless, and did I mention too much salt. Service however was great!"}
{"text":"Was in Tempe on business this week. Living in Florida where Mexican food is just ok I was anxious to checkout some local joint. My hotel concierge recommended this place and I wasn't disappointed. Chips were warm, salsa was ok not great. Ordered the chimichanga on the waiters recommended and was not disappointed. Ate in the outdoor area  on a balmy night watching game 1 of the World Series."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. The worst service ever. Waitress spilled salsa all over the table and seats and didn't even bother to clean it we had to. Wish I could say that was the worst thing about the experience but that was just the beginning. Had to send a dish back twice. Had to wait 15 minutes for a spoon! For a bowl of soup! GF started eating it with a fork. Never going back. Expect bad service"}
{"text":"Average Mexican food. Quest and guacamole are both good choices. Service was good and beer was cold. There are better restaurants nearby, but good for a quick meal or chips and a beer."}
{"text":"After being seated I waited almost 30 mins for a waiter to come over to me. The whole time there were a group of waiters huddled trying to figure out who was assigned to me. Now I'm waiting an additional 15 mins for the waiter to bring me a simple glass of water. Definitely going to bail never to return...."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and attentive.  I had the Baja burro and it was outstanding.  Happy hour is great, live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've reviewed Macayos in the past for dining, but this is for catering. Macayos has been my fav Mexican food in town for over a decade, so when we had a need for catering, I knew exactly where to call!  James, the GM, was super helpful and helped us get a large order on short notice. The food was phenomenal and I have several co workers asking when we will be ordering again! My personal favorites are the fajitas, mini chinos, chicken tortilla soup, and I can't imagine a trip without the Baja sauce. Highly recommended for dining and now also for catering!!"}
{"text":"From a Mexican Vegan I love this place!! The food is great!! I am able to eat the tortillas, the beans and the chips!! All made without lard! The food is fresh and tastes homemade! I love the atmosphere and the service is wonderful! We have had James as our manager last night who took care of all of our needs! Friday night was fun on the patio with music playing and people dancing but inside still an environment you can bring your family to and have a nice dinner, the best of both!"}
{"text":"Tucan Sam Can By The Rue  I didn't have my toes in the water, I didn't have my ass in the sand, My baja burrito was almost okay, The flavor for the most part, bland.  The best thing I can offer up to say, The waiter, was on top of his game, He checked up on us frequently, If I could only remember his name.  I was here for a late, late lunch, As I was leaving the girls were pouring in, The patio here is nice and big, I should have stayed and made them sin.  The grilled fish tacos were just okay, Served with a side of \"baja\" sauce, Stuffed with a little cabage, After I ate I had to floss.  With my burrito I got rice as a side, Got my plate, that wasn't the case, Instead of rice it was black beans, No I didn't punch him in the face.   This place goes off on Cinco de Mayo, However I don't really care, I'd just end up sitting in the corner, Girls in mini skirts I would just stare.   Aribba!!!"}
{"text":"If you like some good food and great service, this is the place to be.   We celebrated our friends 21 birthday here and it was perfect.   The moment we got seated our server Cam was quick to bring us some chips and salsa.   My girlfriend ordered some cheese crisp for appetizers and I'll have say it was really good.  I ordered the chipotle chicken salad and the cilantro lime dressing was on point.  Great place!  Definitely would be back!"}
{"text":"We hosted my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary in one of the private rooms upstairs.  This had to be the easiest event I have ever done with any venue.  The food was good, the staff amazing and the evening went off flawlessly.  They allowed us to bring in our own cake and decorations and even coordinated their napkins to our color scheme.  The waiters were on top of  keeping drinks and food fresh.  We could not have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"3 stars because in my past I have always loved this restaurant, I will give them the benefit of the doubt that since we went on Cinco de Mayo it was a little bit overwhelming for them. Normally I love all the food & the service is fine. Unfortunately last night with it being so busy a lot of things were overlooked for our table. I ordered a strawberry margarita, when it came out I didn't realize they hadn't bothered to mix in the fake strawberry syrup, so the entire bottom was just an awful mouthful of strawberry flavored syrup- made me feel sick I didn't want to finish the drink, so I wouldn't suggest paying extra for \"flavor\" when it was that terrible. We didn't have any place settings, napkins or plates on our table so I had to ask for them after we had been served chips & salsa & still only half were brought to us, took about 10 min just to get napkins. I also had to ask for water & she never brought my friend any water. Then when we got our bill, my friend who had just ordered 2 chicken tacos realized her bill was too expensive for that & when we asked the waitress claimed she charged the taco meal (which should have come with two sides) so even though she was charged for the two sides, the server did not include them. So we asked for them to go since she had already paid for them. Again normally I love this place, but not sure I'd go back on a holiday night. Not really worth a gross drink & bad service. Definitely would suggest it for a regular less busy night, love the food!"}
{"text":"Food was OK but the service was not up to par. We were sitting awhile before we got our drink orders. And we needed refills and had to locate our server."}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner at Macayo's depot and as soon as I get done yelping I'm going to try and find something to wash the foul taste out of my mouth.  Unbelievable!  Wife and I have been here for happy hour at least a dozen times since we moved to downtown tempe and the appetizers are good and the drink specials great also.  Had Mom in from out of town and figured we would walk down there for dinner.  Bad decision.  I had the chicken pablano special with rice and beans.  Chicken had a sour taste, rice was salty and bland at the same time (?) and beans were taco bellish at best.  Wife had smothered chile relleno dinner and thought the enchilada sauce was one of the worst ever.  Note to Macayo's: enchilada sauce should be red not ORANGE.   The only dinner that was edible was Mom's appetizer sampler plate. Go figure.   I'm thinking the reason we could eat the happy hour food was maybe they serve frozen appetizers and the rest of the menu was made by someone who has absolutely no idea what mexican food should taste like.  My advice, have all the food shipped in frozen and you might be OK with the great location and friendly servers and bartenders."}
{"text":"This place makes me hate Mexican food. Everything is fried... bland and gross.  Don't expect to leave without adding 2,000+ calories to your daily diet.  I know that other people have raved about their $2 beer happy hours. This place is right off Mill Ave!! There are better happy hours and better beers all around Mill!  This place is the McDonald's in the ghetto version of a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I did not pick this place, met some people there that picked it. We waited 1 hour for our food, the waiter forgot our drinks twice and the food was just okay. To top it off, I checked my credit card charges a few days later and the waiter charged my bill four times for my bill and they were all for higher than what my bill was for. Fortunately my credit card company only allowed one charge to go through recognizing someone was not being honest.  I would not recommend this place to anyone! Service sucks and they are dishonest."}
{"text":"All show, no delicious burrito.  This place is a decent spot for a group of people to meet for a quick bit, drinks, and a walk to Mill Ave.  It is not, however, a good Mexican restaurant.  The service was very slow.  We had 5 people and all of us were drinking, yet our server seemed completely uninterested in our party.  Typically, this would not be the case unless the place was slammed and leaking extraneous guests, but on this night there were not a whole lot of folks in-house.  The food was so-so.  Chimichanga was the best dish I sampled, but it was not impressive.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day.  The Sahara Rd. Vegas location is much better and much more accomodating.  Maybe this location could learn a thing or two from its other franchises."}
{"text":"Great meeting place for a family dinner, friend get together or to use the big room upstairs for a party. Really good skinny margarita! Their salsa is a little watery. The street chicken tacos are really good!"}
{"text":"This place for some reason has gone downhill. The staff is nice enough and friendly.  I can't believe how salty the food was. All three in my party had the same opinion. I  ate as much as I could since it was kind of pricey, but my wife and son ate maybe half. The atmosphere is still real neat, but since I care more about the food I'm buying and not ambiance, this is why my rating is low. I won't go back unless someone invites to a function there. I'm native to the valley of the sun and used to eat  at Woody's El Nido and Macayo's as well as Depot Cantina. I don't  what happened to this place"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the worst mexican food I've ever had. Even other Macayo's are light years better. Want some dry rice, hot/bland spices, and food that tastes like cardboard? This is your place.  More like a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"So the hubby took off for a sports weekend with the guys and had it absolutely ruined by this restaurant last night. He was the only one who had ordered a fiesta steak salad. Shortly after eating the salad then suddenly felt ill. He couldn't even finish his beer. He threw up violently for the next several hours missing the football game completely. We are convinced it was the lettuce and poor hygiene from the kitchen staff. Just wanted to share this in hopes the restaurant reads and monitors the sanitation activities of this location. Hubby said he'll never have their food again."}
{"text":"I've been to Macayos twice the past few months and had very different experiences. The first time, our waitress Mikayla (who was also holding down the entire bar), gave us awesome service. She was not only busting her butt, but she greeted everyone with a smile, even her coworkers. I told her I wanted her to come work for me and she politely declined. She kept our drinks refilled, and my Baja chicken burro was incredible. The second time I came in, no one greeted us for 10 minutes. We had to ask for chips, our waiter looked like he had too much to drink the night before, and we saw a RODENT. We may give it another shot if Mikayla is still there!"}
{"text":"I always love coming to Macayos, especially this one! They have a great outdoor patio and it's always very lively here. It is so nice to just hang out outside and enjoy their good food and good company!"}
{"text":"First, the service was above average.  Our waiter, a manager, and even another table's waiter checked on us, which was awesome and we really appreciated it.  Granted, it was a slow evening, so I can't speak for the service during busy nights.  When ordering, I wanted some fish tacos and was going to order the beer battered \"seasonal fish\", but the waiter urged me to get the seared ahi tacos (which was the most expensive taco item on the menu).  I agreed and wasn't happy with my decision.  The ahi is a great portion-- but for my taste, they were way too heavily salted.  The waiter saw I wasn't happy with his recommendation and brought me the beer battered fish instead, which were probably the biggest and most delicious fish tacos i have ever had.  One of the managers came over and made sure we were ok, and they even deducted the price difference from the original fish tacos.  I hate complaining about food, but these guys handled it like pros.    My only complaint is the margaritas were weak, but I was expecting that from an $8 Patron margarita.  There was a group of about 20 seated near me that seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I would definitely bring a large group here."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and put it out there that I didn't even venture into the actual restaurant portion of this establishment, but rather camped out in the bar for happy hour.   So, consider this a happy hour/appetizer review, if you like.  They tried really, really hard to make this place feel festive, but succeeded only in making it look like a junkyard full of angry fruit salad.  If you're unfamiliar with that term, head on over to Urban Dictionary.  Go on.  I'll wait.  Are we all together again?  Good.  Let us proceed.  This place sucks.  Not even the free all-you-can-eat appetizers could keep me in here, and I am one cheap bastard.  The only thing they had going for them was the $2 Dos Equis during happy hour.   The appetizer selection was pretty shakey.  There were these things that I think were supposed to be beef enchiladas, a potato concoction, and chips and salsa.  The incognito enchiladas were... stretchy.. and bland.. and the potato thing was about the same, sans the stretchiness.  And how do you fuck up chips?  Seriously?  To top it off, the bartender was slow as shit.  I'll say one.. okay, two good things.  The happy hour is a good deal if you can stomach the food.  They also have a pretty neat lobster claw game where you can \"win\" a live lobster.  Might be worth going in there just to check it out."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place, it's a favorite of mine and always has good service and food! Tonight was by far the best service I have ever received. My friend and I sat in the bar for happy hour and Ben was our bartender/server  and he was amazing!! He took great care of us and made us delicious drinks even when we were indecisive of what we wanted. If Ben is working when you are there, make sure he makes your drinks!!"}
{"text":"Today, my husband and I were very excited to try this mexican restaurant. Our friends had told us many times they have great food so naturally we had high expectations.    This was not the case. Immedietly we were put off by the manager at the front desk demeaning the staff around him. We had to stand and wait to be sat while he proceeded to yell at them. Later we asked our waiter what that managers name is and he told us his name is Casey. It took forever to get to our table, but when we finally did our server was wonderful. We ordered enchiladas and fajitas which were decent but overpriced for their quality. The margaritas on the other hand tasted so good I wanted more.   Overall, we would try this place again but would really like to see it run differently."}
{"text":"Had an event here on Saturday night and the staff was extremely nice and tended to every need of the attendees. Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Atmosphere is good. Service is great. Outdoor patio is the way to go in the Spring and late winter."}
{"text":"Met Jeff at the Macayo's tent at FanFest Scottsdale, he went above and beyond to make my friends and I have a great time! Thanks so much Jeff, your customer service was A+"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! My family is from Texas and it's the closest to true Texas Mexican food we can find in the valley. I could live on the chips and salsa and my husband loves the beer specials. The carne asada is probably my favorite- love the shredded beef also. The Baja sauce is a must-make sure you get it warmed up if you order a side.  Service is always good and it's nice to be able to sit on the patio, too."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Macayo's in a while and knew some of the guys from back in the day, so I dropped in to say hi. Marcos mentioned Jeff was in and was recommended the Ahi Tacos! One word...phenomenal!  They are seriously on point, flavorful, and prepared just right *seared* Thanks Jeff!"}
{"text":"I come to this location a few times a month with co workers and every visit is nice, but this last Tuesday was by far the best. We had DYLAN as our server and he was so upbeat and made our experience exceptional. Such a sweetheart! We will continue to come back and request him every time! He is the best server we've had in a very long time, at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Rancid chips, wobbly table, bland food, cheese crisp missing some of the tortilla but this time good service for a change.   I eat here only when there is a family event and they go there.  This is consistently the worst Mexican food in town which is a shame because it is a great location and cool ambiance.  Wake up and smell the salsa"}
{"text":"This was the most embarrassing, disgusting night I've had at a restaurant.  First off all, the waiter was too busy making fun of my drink order (smaller size) to get it right, even after coming back to double check what I'd ordered.  The food itself was barely decent enough to eat since we were there and had paid for it, but I (and everyone else in my party) declined take home boxes for the leftovers.  Worst of all, we got about halfway through our chips before we discovered a USED sugar packet in the bottom of the bowl.  Apparently, they took a bowl from a previous table, refilled it, and passed it on to us without emptying it or cleaning it.  When we pointed it out to the waiter, we got nothing by a fresh bowl of chips and a surprised look.  NO apology, no words at all, from the waiter.  This was back in March (2008), and I reported it to the business the next day.  They, too, offered no apology.  In fact, the only apology I ever received for this potential health violation was from the friend who recommended that I go to this place.  Avoid it like the plague.  There are better places for Mexican food, no matter how Americanized you like it.  Update:  I mentioned my horror story to an acquaintance who had just gone to Macayo's.  He found it interesting, since he noticed the waiters now mash the chips as they pick them up from a table.  We wonder if they do this to make it clear which bowls have used chips, and which are fresh.  He said the food was still \"meh.\"  Over a year later, and I still never received an apology.  You'd think they'd take a health violation more seriously than that."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start....  1. Server - terrible.  Rhiannon. Completely unattentive.  Didn't bring what we asked for without re-asking (or finally asking a different server).  Water constantly empty.  Chips empty.  Asked for lemons and they never came.  And to top it all we went for lunch and they gave us dinner menus. When she came to the table after sitting for 10 min and I asked for the lunch menus she responded \"I'll look but I don't know if I can find any\". Seriously? Oh ok. I'll just pay dinner prices at lunch if you don't have any. She finally came back with lunch menu's but wouldn't have if we didn't ask.  2. Atmosphere - they ask us if we wanted to sit by their pond. Sure! Why not?  We had the pleasure of looking at the cups, forks, menu, paper and other assorted trash items floating around in there.  And no...it wasn't windy out today at all.    The food itself was not bad but we all agreed we would never go back based upon everything above."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Woody's restaurants in Phoenix from the mid-sixties (El Nido on McDowell) until as recently as a week ago at Macayo on Central.  Late in the afternoon on Saturday, we went to the Tempe location for the first time, and were very disappointed.  The food was as good as usual, but we had two issues.  First, I ordered a standard Margarita.  I hadn't eaten since morning, so had an empty stomach, and I could tell that there was no alcohol in that drink.  NONE.  Eight dollars is pretty expensive for a glass of Margarita mix.  Second, when our server brought the bill, there were two mistakes in the restaurant's favor totaling two dollars and 29 cents.  All together, about $10 overcharged!"}
{"text":"Doesn't rate one star. To say food was horrible is being kind. We ate there after ironman to celebrate  and this was ruined by the disgusting food. Made us sick. Never again. Other maycayos were good."}
{"text":"On its best day this place is mediocre. The food is what you'd expect from a Mexican food joint. Nothing exciting here. The thing that sets this place apart is the service. I'm kind of surprised its still in business. I went there most recently for Sunday football ticket with 5 friends. It may have been 40 minutes between rounds despite us being just one of two tables. We had to ask a number of times before anyone brought us anything. Terrible experience from a bunch of unmotivated college students. Our server had a Cardinals Rodgers-Cromartie jersey on. If he waits on you, be prepared to WAIT on him. Lazy as hell.  Bottom line is there are a number of better places nearby, pick one of them instead."}
{"text":"Nice friendly people.I am a wimp when it comes to spice and I told them that and told me which was the least spicy and it was delectable!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at Macayo's Depot Cantina at the Tempe, Arizona location right next to Arizona State University! The atmosphere is very colorful and lively with a full bar outside and inside, patio seating, indoor seating, and TV's everywhere. The dress code is very casual and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone going out for date night or bringing the entire family!"}
{"text":"Terrible Terrible service !!! Don't go there!  Drinks were weak. Even the manager couldn't help us with better service. Half of our party didn't get their check and some of our party got their food an hour after the rest of us did and we all ordered at the same time.  Instead of the waitress apologizing she just disappeared!!  I will not go back!"}
{"text":"Need more Brunch business!  Went here for the Brunch menu I found online.  The server didn't even know there was a Brunch menu.  They have cheap drink specials and a reasonably priced Brunch menu.  Down sides - they didn't have champagne for one of the specialty drinks and the service was slow.  I would like to think it was because of the food specials we ordered took extra time to make fresh.  One of our friends we were there with posted a picture of the food on Facebook and got a big reactions from his friends.  They were surprised there was a Brunch menu here...it was seen as we found a secret menu.    Please advertise your Brunch more and be prepared for it.    Thank you,  Regular Brunch goer"}
{"text":"More than 11 dollars for one beer and one diet coke, and this was supposed to be happy hour. And that was before the tip. Which I now regret giving.  They were extremely slow waiting on us even though the place was empty. Lesson learned. Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Been going to macayos for years and they are still so good! They're chips and salsa are delicious! Gina is our favorite server from this location, she always does am amazing job and is super nice!"}
{"text":"A little overpriced but still a good deal and they deliver around the area! How cool is that?? Great patio and fun atmosphere. Guacamole was ok."}
{"text":"I have a complaint to bring up concerning the employees of this particular restaurant =.= THEY TOOK FOREVER WITH THE FOOD, and I swear I feel like they put alcohol in my ceviche! D: but then again, they were pretty nice people, and their smiles on them faces pleases me, so y'all made the cut. Congrats."}
{"text":"Bleck!  Chips that taste funky, like the oil is rancid.  Salsa, Macayo's used to have awesome salsa, but now it seems water-downed.  This place looks like it needs a power-washer and a deep clean.  And the food was meh and really not very good."}
{"text":"Mediocre mexican food! Delicious but not outstanding. Crispy taquitos. Fresh tamales. And crunchy chimichangas! Try their Baja dip!"}
{"text":"Second time here this week. Love the food love the service, Ben in particular. Was not too busy while I was there, but all the staff was sweating profusely and the thermostat by my table read 85. I would love to go back, but I think I'll wait until winter or when they turn on the AC"}
{"text":"Worst Happy Hour. EVER. In fact, my group of friends labeled it our \"Friday UNHAPPY Hour\".  1. The music is INSANELY loud, prohibiting a normal conversation even if the person is sitting right next to you.  2. The DJ is absolutely TERRIBLE. 3. While the free food concept is great......it was all kinda gross. 4. The server acted like she was doing us a favor. 5. The mix of people is really odd and kinda creepy. Old creeper men, weird ghetto younger men, and just a few of us business types. Really not the scene for a happy hour with business associates or 'sophisticated' friends.  The ONLY good thing I have to say is that they can't mess up tequila."}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say about this place. Do I rate the outside patio scene? Do I rate my dinner? Do I rate Buffy & Taffy getting completely wasted at the corner table?  I met up with some friends here some Fridays ago and the outside patio was loud and insane. My friends wanted to survery the scene so outside we sat, straining to hear each other. A couple of top shelf margaritas later, we were still waiting for dinner. I shouldn't put my expectations too high - I ordered fajitas and they were just ok. Nothing special. But I had to order dinner because taquitos wasn't going to cut it.   I will give them this, though. They have one salsa which is H-O-T. My generous friends let me have at the whole bowl. Serrano-less pico de gallo only goes so far for me.   So, well, am I going to go out of my way to drive through hell-ass traffic on the 202 on Friday after work just so I can sit at the Macayao Depot patio? Probably not. Although drunk Buffy and Taffy were pretty amusing.   But this place is what it is, and I shouldn't have expected much. And it doesn't make much of a case for me to try the Macayo's on Central but you know, stranger things have happened..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Been going here since I was a kid. Order anything with Carne Asada or Baja sauce. The patio is a great atmosphere. Great managers (:"}
{"text":"Meh.  Green chili stew was tasty but no heat at all.  What really struck me however was the portion size.  Good grief what a tiny, expensive bowl.  Seriously, it would have been small for an appetizer.  Location must be the only thing keeping this place open.  Very poor value."}
{"text":"I have gone here since it opened, and it has always been my favorite mexican restaurant.  In the last couple of months the management has made some changes that have made this place even better.  The salsa is now made fresh every day and you can totally tell!  They also added freah guacamole to the menu which has a great flavor and again, it is fresh!  My personal favorite is the baja sauce.  I will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"Food might have been good if the server had taken our order a lot sooner than 25 minutes and brought it out before we had to leave back to work. After all lunch is only an hour long and it took the food that long to come out. Paid for it anyway but wont get chance to eat it."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the low number of stars Macayo's has thus far!  When I went to ASU and lived in Arizona I went to Macayo's all the time.  Whenever I travel there now I always make a stop, as they have the best Mexican food in Tempe.    The venue is very large but it's organized well enough where you don't feel like you're in a swarm of people.  I've been to a few events there as well (in the back, outside area) and it's perfect if you want to be apart from the rest of the restaurant.  If you don't know what to order, just pick anything with the Baja sauce...it's amazing.  If you haven't been here on Cinco de Mayo, it's a must stop. They have events all day long and great drink specials.    I can honestly say that this place consistently provides great service, amazing food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thank you Jessica for being such a great server!  She was on the whole time we dined from time we sat down to get our drinks and bring out chips and salsa. Second time back here while in town for spring training. We remembered this place for its great outdoor ambiance and is also very family friendly. Good food too. We were told the Chimichanga was invented here..this one big as a burrito and is very meaty with a nice flaky crust yummm. The combo platter was great for trying a bit of everything you couldn't decide on from the menu too. Kids shared it along with some tacos. We'll definatley return again."}
{"text":"Look good place is clean margarita taste refreshing they also bring the chips and salsa fresh"}
{"text":"This used to be such a fun, energetic place to come. Now, I feel like I'm going to a funeral that has food.   You enter through a gigantic outdoor patio that is never used. It really does not encourage you to come inside. The place once was more of a destination restaurant, rather than just a place to eat some crappy Mexican food (yes, Filli Bs is probably better).  The owners have sadly not maintained the restaurant or updated the menu. The food has become drab.  I'll be surprised if this place is around much longer....."}
{"text":"I am gonna take a different approach than most reviewers on my beloved Macayo's Depot Cantina. Mainly because I have never ordered anything off the menu, and I have only gone on Friday nights. I am a college kid and there are three things than any college kid loves: 1.  Free Food- They have a buffet style chips salsa and queso bar that equals free friday dinner to me! 2.  Cheap Drinks- Gotta LOVE the $2 Dos Equis 3. Fun Music- Yes, they do take requests on the patio.  I have danced away many a night at Macayo's Depot Cantina!! and it gets a five star rating in my book!"}
{"text":"Huge after work meet up for drinks and dinner. We get there and it's empty -- literally not another table there. It took almost 10 mins just to get menus and someone to take out drink order.  I am going to make this quick and to the point -- I don't plan on returning to this hot mess. The service is incredibly incrediblyyyyyyyyyy slow and sloppy. The food sucks -- delivered cold. I would have complained but after delivering the food we didn't see the waiter for like 30 + mins.   To sum it up -- our waiter was also the bartender. Bad move on the part of the restaurant.  Food and services were terrible -- will not return.  Oh AND a couple at our large table left early. So when we went to pay our bill they told us that that couple never paid and asked if we were going to take care of it.  We called our friends to ask what happened -- they texted us a photo of the paid receipt!!!!!!!!! This restaurant is extremely poorly managed --- double charge??? Keep it classy Macayo's !!!"}

{"text":"I had lunch with co-workers yesterday at the Depot Cantina in Tempe. I knew right away that I was in trouble when I saw no mention of Jalapeno or Habanero peppers on the menu -- it had quasi-mex written all over it. I ordered a Baha Chimi; their \"signature\" Chimichanga stuffed with your choice of meat (I had Chicken), topped with Relleno sauce, Macayo's Baja sauce, and cheese. I went for the grande dinner option, which adds refried beans, rice, sour cream, and guacamole for an additional 2 bucks and change. It was pretty good, nothing mind blowing. Their Baja sauce is unique, and quite tasty. By the waiter's own admission, nothing on the menu is truly spicy. They didn't even offer hot sauce in a bottle...eek! We sat outside under the patio cover and the music was a little loud for casual conversation. Overall, it felt more like a college bar that serves decent bar food, than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere a little loud when talking with others. Ordered fajitas enough for two! I was only given 3 tortillas. Portion size was great for the price. Also ordered a beerrita and really wasn't that great instead of a half bottle it gave me a full bottle and less margarita.Waitress was nice and came by often to check on her tables. All and all nice place at a historical train depot"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'd ever go to Macayo's if it didn't have $2 Dos Equis and a free buffet on Fridays. The food is your typical Mexican chain food. The patio is huge which is a plus between 75 and 95 degrees after that it gets pretty torturous. All in all, it's an alright spot to crash out with friends after work on Fridays."}
{"text":"Since some coworkers requested to come here for their birthday, I begrudgingly complied. You'd think that in five years a location would improve enough to at least earn an extra star. This is not the case. It's been over five years now since I've been to Depot Cantina. It'll likely be another 10 before I return.  With seven of the ten already at the location that would be joining us for lunch today, the first person we spoke with stated that we had to wait for the others to show before he would sit us. Mind you, they weren't busy in the slightest. So we stood. Waiting. Eventually, another individual came by and kindly offered to seat us, that it wasn't a problem.  That's pretty close to where the good stops, sadly. It took over an hour to get our food. Our waitress at one point apologized, stating that it wasn't really her table (even though she's the only one we dealt with the entire time). And even when we did get our food, my order was incorrect not once, but twice. After the second round, I chose to forego any further attempts by them to get it correct. I don't blame our server really. She seemed very busy and likely didn't have the support she needed.  Also, if dust or cobwebs bother you, don't bother coming here. Most of the light fixtures and the various ledges around the venue are covered in cobwebs and a thick layer of what looks like very old dust.   I do not recommend Macayo's in any way, shape or form."}
{"text":"Literally the worst happy hour ever.  Do not go there for the free buffet there is a reason its free.  Not even mexican food.  They had uncooked potato wedges that weren't edible, spaghetti w alfredo sauce that was coagulated and cold, burritos filled w beans and rice and slathered w jalepenos also cold and tasted the best of the absolute worst.  Drinks were no big deal and overpriced for happy hour.  Big mistake going here.  Both hubby and I can't stop talking about how bad it was and how we got ripped.  8-18 just wanted to update.  Told the manager at the time how bad it was and the food they served wasnt food.  He insisted that it was food and told me that he would send me an email with a coupon to come back and have dinner on them.  I never got an email.  He was full of it and could really care less.  During happy hour they kept telling us that the premier marg was only .30 less than the house which was over 7 bucks.  Dont make the same mistake!  Go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Macayo's since I moved to the Valley in 96. Love this place. Great place to go for lunch, happy hour or dinner. They have great food, decent beer selection and its near the college. The salsa that they bring to the table is some of the best salsa around. Great balance of flavors and they keep bringing you more as your bowl runs dry.   If you're in Tempe and want some good local mexican grub....this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Really only come here once a year on July 4th.  Great staff and good food, definitely a place to stop before watching the firework over Tempe Town Lake / Tempe Beach Park."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! Brought the wrong beer 20 min to get it, then food order was wrong. So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  The food is good.  The service is great too.  Today I had the Carnita dinner for lunch with out cheese.  The food was really really good.  Great place and it rocks.  I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I had a good time at the depot cantina. It is a fun atmosphere and is a great place to grab some brews and food. I had some sampler platter which was extremely tasty! I like their tortilla chips and their salsa is pretty good. $2 Dos Equis all day every day and I am a fan of the dos. FYI, If you go here during a tempe event you can park but you have to pay $20 to do so, then they give you a ticket that you give to the waiter to get your $20 back. If you want some tasty mex food and alcohol this is probably the best spot to go in the tempe/mill area. Lot's of people watching and places to sit. I love the big margarita glasses and you get a discount on the tasty margs if you buy one and bring it back with you on your next visit."}
{"text":"The food is always supremo. Usually I'm a Mexican food snob, due to the fact that I hail from New Mexico. Our food is always better than what AZ offers. Buuuuut Macayo's surely delivers. The food is never soggy or messy. Never stale or tasteless. The green corn tamale is super divine. The only drawback is the salsa."}
{"text":"the place is huge and has a great outdoor seating area.  macayo's always has some sort of drink special going on- just ask!  i've never ate too much at macayo's but when i do it always hits the spot.  this place was my first stop on a lightrail adventure in day drinking!  come here with a group or for happy hour or for day drinking or for outdoor seating.  lots of reasons to come here, see!?"}
{"text":"The service there sucks. I would never go back after my first and last experience. I work in the same industry and at my job we do not make our guest feel like their begging to spend their money. And that is just how I felt at this Macayo's locations."}
{"text":"If half star ratings were possible, I would give this a 3.5, but I'm rounding up. The pros: Food was good. I had the ahi tacos which were perfectly seared on the outside with a tasty blackening seasoning and rare inside.  It came with calabacitas and delicious black beans.  The kids menu includes a \"build your own taco\" with basically a bento of taco fixin's.  Brilliant!   Service was great.  The waiter was personable, helpful, and brought the 3 yr old's food out first.  So helpful! Nice Patio.  The cons:  This place is loud.  I mean really loud inside.   The furnishings.  Well, rustic is the best description.   Great for big groups. Big variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Really love going to this places to watch games or have happy hours the have a patios and great inside bar. Great food and service is awesome!  Always a good to spot when I am near by."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in after she had boot camp, to undo the progress she just made. She had chicken fajitas, I had a beef enchilada, pretty standard fare. I definitely like the location, and it's very big. There isn't a whole lot of parking, but it is close to the light rail. They also have a big outdoor patio which seems great for happy hours or birthday parties or anything where you have a big group. I didn't notice if they have misters, but there is a bar outside and I believe they have games outside, too. The service we had was good. Our food came out fast, our order was correct, and it was pleasant, except for the person at the next table celebrating her 28th birthday with a loud song from the staff. Never understood that bizarre ritual myself, but it seemed like she was enjoying herself, too, so good on Macayo's!"}
{"text":"No wait on a Friday night! Our servers kept our glasses filled and our food came out promptly. The food was pretty good. I got fajitas and they came with many toppings, impressive! Great meal overall."}
{"text":"This location is huge! It's just off of Ash near Mill ave next to the light rail tracks.  I love the huge outdoor patio and decor.  Great place to hang out for a ASU football game.  The happy hour was good and they have decent drink specials.  The food is good, we tried the baja sauce burrito which was great!  The fajitas had good flavor as well.  All in all no complaints.  We came with a large group and the food and drinks were quick."}
{"text":"I give it five stars for specials, ambiance and food quality! The services was not particularly over the top, it was barely sub par, but she was nice answering all our questions.   We had a party of 19 for a 30th birthday party. Having a party of 19 I would think you should have more help as a server. Some of us arrived around 5 for the happy hour which was particularly surprising at how good the happy hour pricing was. The appetizers came out very quickly and were palatable! The queso and cheese crisps were two of the best appetizers we had of the baked zucchini, sweet corn balls and quac. The homemade chips and salsa was also amazing!!  I did have three margaritas and did not catch a buzz at all. For me food cancels all disappointment in services and alcohol. The main courses were two of the best that I have had in a long time! Kudos to Macayo's on their skills of cooking amazing Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my friends 21st birthday. Cam was our server and he was SO AWESOME and attentive!! He went above and beyond to make sure her birthday was special!!! The food was delicious and portions were huge!! Recommend the cheese crisps!!"}
{"text":"Went here after a graduation ceremony and it wasn't very busy.  The California Burro is my favorite item on the menu.  They're margaritas are pretty good too.  Service was quick and everything we ordered tasted great."}
{"text":"Attention, General Manager......you have a problem.  Went to lunch here for the 1st time in a while.  The buddy that I went with said \"man, the last time I came here, the service was BAD.\"  Why I didn't heed his comment and go to any of the other 50 restaurants within a 2 mile radius, I don't know.  We walk in the front door, and there are 10+ people waiting to be seated.  No evidence of a hostess, nothing.  We stand there for maybe 5 minutes, during which time several various employees walked through the room, none of who payed any attention to the fact that there are now about 12 people waiting for any sign of life and ultimately a place to park our rear ends and get a menu.  We decided to go into the bar area, which was pretty full with the same vibe of no employees, lots of patrons, nothing happening.  By some miracle, we were finally seated by a mute hostess, and it then took about 10 minutes to hear from anyone else.  From the time we sat down until the time we left, about 1hr and 10 minutes passed.  Every step of the way was us waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for the drinks, (just WATER by the way.....no bartender required) waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for water refills, waiting for our check, waiting to wait for something else.  The food - decent, but who cares.  Not going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"While the food is a tad bit better than average, the customer service is non-existent.  Brought  45 people in for a preplanned luncheon.  Macayo's botched the buffet, by letting it run out despite the contract calling for a refresh.  Granted they finally refilled, but only after a long delay.   Macayo's forgot several meals, yet constant reminders managed to get them served well after everyone else had ate.  Forget dealing with macayo's planners, they fail big time!  They might be OK with onsies and twosies tables, but I wouldn't count on that either.  Taco Bell would be a better bet."}
{"text":"I must say that I am quite surprised by the lack of superior ratings given to Macayo's on this site.  I live literally right next to Macayo's and had never been there in my three years as a Tempe resident. When I heard through a friend that Macayo's was more than some college bar that is known for more than bar foods, I had to give it a shot.  The service was VERY friendly and efficient. Both my girlfriend's meal and mine was delivered in a very timely fashion. Not only that, but I was more than happy with the quality of the meal. The only reason I didn't feel that I could give this a full 5/5 was because the portion's weren't up to my standards. If I pay $12.95 for a burrito, I fully expect that I will be full. Given that the burrito I ordered was fit with two sides and extra meat, I was surprised when a Lean Pocket-sized entree came before me. However, it was delicious and I can't really complain too much.  I particularly liked the decor in the restaurant. Although the main part is quite difficult to access due to the gargantuan bar in the front, it's a very comfortable, friendly environment.  I'm definitely coming here again soon."}
{"text":"Chris just made me the finest margarita I've had since I've been in Arizona. For real!  Seriously, though...Warm, friendly service and a totally authentic feel to the place! Great chips and salsa, too! (Who doesn't judge THAT book by its cover???)  And I meant it about the margarita.  Highly recommend this fun place! Came during summer but it looks like the giant fireplace outside would be a fun cool night on the patio."}
{"text":"Took out of town guests here as I have always loved this place- HOWEVER - it was the worst!!! Daughter found a hair in her taco, they charged $1.99 for sour cream that never came, tried to charge an additional $1.99 each for rice and beans with my taco when it was clearly stated on the menu that they come with the taco. The patio was filthy (I know its outside but it was awful- and half the chairs were broken ). Very disappointed- I will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times, but I guess I never wrote a review. I used to get the free happy hour buffet, but not sure that buffet is still happening. I was there on a recent Sunday where they closed early due to renovations. On Sunday, happy Hour goes on all day which was a good thing. They have several appetizers on special, but I tried the $3 Tamale bites which were green chili and cheese basically deep fried with a cream cheese kind of sauce. I did enjoy those as a nice snack. The real menu looked a bit overpriced, but the beers at HH were reasonable at $3 a pop for any beer on tap. Listen for the train and enjoy some a good happy hour at this location."}
{"text":"Macayos Depot Cantina is my go to location for almost any occasion. I have had my birthday here with my family(10 guests), drinks with friends(2-4 guests), and also my marriage celebration dinner(30 guests). All of which ran smooth and exactly what I wanted.  Most recently Macayos Depot Cantina was the location for a party I hosted for my best friend. I couldn't be more happy with how it turned out, and my guests shared the same opinion! We provided the restaurant GM with our budget and size of our party and he provided the perfect amount of food for the number of guests in attendance(which was around 40).   We went with a buffet style arrangement and when any item began to run out, our servers were quick to replenish! The food was fresh and I received lots of compliments on offering such good food at a baby shower! Thanks to the kitchen staff!   We had a perfect size section of the patio where we were able to seclude ourselves from the rest of the patio but still able to enjoy the atmosphere. We decided to allow anyone who wanted alcoholic beverages to do so on their own and we had plenty of staff come through often to check on everyone. Crystal was one of our many servers who helped our party that day and she was absolutely awesome! Being the \"host\", I was in 20 places at once and when I asked for the cake to be brought out from the fridge, she brought small plates and extra forks also, talk about anticipating customer needs! And when I tried to clean up at the end she insisted I leave it to them, no complaints from me...  Thank you to everyone involved! I have been meaning to leave a review since my wedding dinner but hadn't gotten around to it. With all the compliments I am still receiving on hosting my most recent party, I cannot thank the entire staff and management enough. Anyone who has had to host a large party for any event would know how hard and stressful it can be, let these guys take care of you!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of evening and sat out on the patio area where the waitresses ignore you until you jump up and grab one even though she run ever table around yours. She wont even look at you when you wave at them. Had to go to the inside bar to order drinks instead and me snd my friend got sick drinking the overly sugary daiquiri and long island. Had to leave early after feeling sick but did finally wave down a waitress and get some chips."}
{"text":"Huge resturant! There's another large outside seating area with a bars. This would be the perfect place for college age customers. The service was good. The chicken tortilla soup was better than I could ever make. The ingredients were fresh and of generous portion size."}
{"text":"Cheese crisp with guacamole is so good. Baja chili with pork is a must. Rice and beans are so good"}
{"text":"I used to come every so often for a cheap, quick lunch until my last visit.  My order of chicken tacos came out as steak tacos instead. Whatever, close enough and not a big deal. But I was not pleased with the stale, hard edged tortillas they used for said tacos. I also kept finding uncooked grains of rice that I had to spit out.   Overall the quality of the food and ingredients was so sub par I couldn't believe it. Just nasty, low quality fare that makes Filibertos look upscale. (And I like Filis)"}
{"text":"Was in town for the race and this restaurant was close to our hotel (within a couple of miles) the location was odd and we almost thought we had the wrong place because we saw it branded as Depot Cantina (the Macayos sign wasn't turned on I guess).  Our service was good and the environment was as well. The food was good but be warned- the Baja sauce is spicy! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really like the Macayo's on Central, and go there about once a month.  I haven't been to Depot Cantina in several years. Woody Macayo should make them take his name off the sign.  We went on a Saturday evening, after a concert at Gammage. The patio was dark and vacant, and we wandered in to the host stand. There was nobody there. We thought they were closed and were turning to leave when a server came up and showed us to a table in the bar.   Chips, salsa, and water arrived, and I asked for the \"hot\" sauce, the stuff without all the cilantro in it--the good stuff. Tick tock tick tock. We finished the other stuff waiting for the hot sauce, which finally arrived. Both sauces were awful. Super watery, it just dripped off the chip. Definitely not the same stuff they serve on Central. He took my margarita order and the food order. We asked for more of the watery, chunky salsa for her. It never did come.  When it came, my margarita tasted weird, like they had used an incorrect ingredient in making it. Based on the previous inattentiveness of our waitron, I decided not to wait another 10 minutes to send it back.  I ordered two enchiladas, and all rice, no beans. My wife ordered the chile relleno, all beans, no rice. The enchiladas were okay, but the rice was dismal. When was it cooked, on Thursday? I usually eat about half in the restaurant, and eat the rest at home later. I ate a few forkfuls and left the rest. My wife said her relleno was okay, but she only ate a bit of her beans, too.  The check came. We paid. We left, and vowed never to return.  I give it that second star because I have good memories of coming here many years ago."}
{"text":"Great food, got the steak and chicken fajitas!! But absolutely terrible service. Waited almost 30 minutes to just get waters. During the time we were waiting I downloaded this app just to write a review. Server didn't seem to care at all how long we waited. I work in the industry as a server as well and know what it's like to be busy but this was ridiculous. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"this is not the place to go for fabulous mexican food. it's not bad, but it's like going to applebee's and expecting a great steak.  i really only like their happy hour cause it comes with free food. mini chimis, chips and salsa and taquitos and such are free if you sit in the bar. i haven't been in awhile, and all locations are different, but from i remember, margaritas weren't a HH special, which is pretty much blashpemy. for friday HH there is usually a DJ.   this particular location has been going through some heavy renovations, as there will be a light rail stop literally on their patio doorstep (p.s. the otuside area is HUGE), so imagine in the next few years this plca will have a fairly large crowd for HH all week long."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd year in a row I've come to Macayo's with a large group because the space, location, decent food and reasonable prices have made this place a convenient go to spot. Unfortunately after this recent visit our large party will be looking to go elsewhere. I understand it is difficult with a large group and only using 2 waiters for over 30 people can be a daunting task but if you can't handle the heat.....  The waiter was asked to start orders with the birthday guest and his fiancé who sat at the end of the table making it easy, it did not happen. Since we had so many in our party some had to sit at a separate table, no big deal. What was a big deal was never being given menus, asking 3 times for silverware, and 3 or more times for refills. My kids and another guest at the other table got their food  but then waited 10 minutes for silverware to eat it with. There didn't seem to be an issue keeping the booze flowing at the other table, perhaps because more booze, more money, more tips.  When I finally got my two Angus \"where's the Beef\" tacos (see photo) they were cold, complete with a saucer of a few small spoonfuls of black beans and Calabacitas for the bargain price of $12.49.  At the end of the evening there was an extremely long wait to get checks, they failed to realize or tell us they could not split so many. A beverage was added to mine but removed when asked but they could not split the bill for 2. But to take the cake...when they all finally got straightened out and only the birthday guest was left waiting to pay he got stuck paying for a bill of extra drinks. The waiter told them that someone left without paying their bill. I'm not sure how that could happen since everyone that ordered booze ordered food.  No birthday dessert so I guess that was his gift from Macayos!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! Great atmosphere! Indoor and outdoor seating, perfect for year round enjoyment.  All you can eat chips and salsa.... The queso with spinach was creamy and delish!!! When in town, we will be back! Great bar too!!"}
{"text":"We end up at this place quite often and always leave slightly disappointed.   This time was our last visit.  Our waiter was less than attentive. (Two tables sat after us, and ordered after us, got their food before us) He left our drinks empty for a long while, and my father had to chase him down to pay.   But I found a piece of wood in my beef taco. When my mother alerted the manager he said \"Yeah, that sometimes happens...\" He ended up comping the meal but that was NOT the right reaction.   The food is typically tasty (when there is no wood pieces in it) but the service just ruins the experience."}
{"text":"Wasn't satisfied with the food or drinks. The food was frozen and cooked to serve. The drinks were low on alcohol.  The only positive was the fast service. I tried the tamale bites and it was ok, almost tasted like jack in the box fried jalapeño poppers. Overall, wouldnt return."}
{"text":"I really like that Macayo's has a refreshing Taco Salad instead of the normal slathered in lard refried beans & cheese salads that a lot of other places offer. This particular location is giant, with a big outdoor patio and a very large inside. I've only been here for work lunches so it's never crowded and the service has been fine. The menu has a lot of Tex-Mex choices so there is something for everyone. I really like the chips & salsa, enchiladas, and taco salad...nothing mind blowing but it's good for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first meal in Tempe, recommended by our hotel concierge. I should have spent the 5 min researching on Yelp to find a decent Mexican joint, but was hungry and lazy. This is as authentic Mexican as P.F. Chang is to Chinese food.   However - the staff was great and very friendly. So its not their fault they work for a chain. But I can sum up my experience in one phrase: not worth the calories.   Pro: location, size, and staff.  Con:"}
{"text":"Best Drink specials in Tempe!!! This is my first stop of the night when I go to Mill Ave. The food is amazing the patio is huge and the staff always friendly. I'm addicted to their chimichunga's and burritos!!!"}
{"text":"I always love going to Macayo's! Very friendly staff and the blackened ahi tacos are delicious!! I gave 4 stars because my waitress was not very nice and seemed to have no enthusiasm, but her co-worker, CHRIS, automatically saw that we were displeased and came to the rescue. He was very helpful and made out experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Terry gave us awesome service! Very prompt, polite and caring. The food wasn't anything over the top but it was on par for your average Mexican restaurant. You come here more for the atmosphere, kind service and great happy hour. They treated our family's graduation party as if we were the only table in the restaurant. Will return soon."}
{"text":"During an empty restaurant, the server was so preoccupied forgot three out of nine for drinks. There is credit to those who can remember who ordered what or the sequence. Drinks made incorrectly, corn tortillas rubbery, meat so thick you can't bite through a sandwich. Sad experience this round."}
{"text":"The cheese crisps were delicious, everything I was hoping they would be after seeing video on Facebook. Topped with a prickly pear margarita, yep, fabulous.  Macayo's will be my first stop next time I fly into Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."}
{"text":"I recently ate here with my old boss from many years ago.  Food was ok and margaritas were \"different\" as expressed by my former boss from Austin, TX.  My margaritas (and I had several different types) definitely tasted different than any of the many margaritas I've had all over the place (not bad but maybe just weak and lacking tequila with certainly a \"different\" kind of flavor than I've ever had before).    The food portion size was very large but the wait staff got a bit irritating with constant upselling (we had a new wait staff being trained by a manager and the manager was over the top exaggerating the upsale).  We had ordered queso but thankfully with all the focus on training the upsale they forgot about it and my old boss and I were full to bursting.  The menu descriptions also seemed to be a bit different than what we received but we just drank more and let it slide."}
{"text":"My friend and I were out and about and decided to stop for a margarita. When we arrived at the bar, the counter was sticky as if a drink had spilt and never wiped up. Once the bartender approached, we asked him could he wipe it up and he just answered with \"what can I get you\". I repeated and he just shook his head and said OK. We both ordered margaritas and once they arrived, he still never wiped it up. The margaritas tasted like sweet juice. We had to ask someone else to wipe off the counter. As we sat there for about 15 minutes, we looked around and noticed two other young women walked in and were seated and served chips and salsa right away. Our bartender noticed we were watching and approached us and said \"I'll bring you ladies some salsa and chips\" we both said to each other, \"now he want to bring us salsa and chips\". I've never had salsa so liquidy in my life, so much so that I couldn't scoop up the salsa to stay on the chip. The final straw was when he picked up two margarita Señorita mugs to serve 2 other ladies, looked in them and I guess he noticed something in the cup. He blew (what ever was in) it out with his breath, both glasses and proceeded to line with salt and pour in the margarita. My friend and I looked with disgust. We both decided that we were DONE but would inform the manager first. On our way to see the manager, we passed by the station that serves the chips and salsa. If customers were able to see the area in which they are being served from, they would pass on the chips and salsa! It was disgusting...dirty, dried up food matter all over, also the station where they drop off dirty plates and cups with leftover food still on them.  After informing the manager of my dissatisfaction snd letting him know we WERE NOT paying for our drinks, he said that he would talk to the bartender. Not good enough for me, we will NEVER go back there again! As I was leaving, I didn't feel right not informing those ladies that the bartender had not cleaned out the mugs they were drinking out of but did blow out whatever was in their mugs.  EWWWWW! That entire experience put a bad taste in my mouth for all Macayo's. Would have not given any stars at all but that was not an option!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa always make me happy. The Brava Burro was a mini-burrito with a side of lettuce, tomatos, and salsa. Inside the burrito is rice, refried beans, and I chose chicken over the option of shredded beef. The was some good spice used to heat up the meal and my tongue was on fire. But the tortilla was bland, and I could have whipped up the same type of meal at my house.  The patio area was the highlight of the restaurant, and had plenty of tables, and a large fountain, which created the illusion of water in the 98 degree heat.  $5.99 + $2 = $8 + tax and tip."}
{"text":"So this another popular Mexican chain restaurant in AZ.  Fun atmosphere with Mexican decor throughout make this a great place and can accommodate larger groups and families.  The food is what you expect for classical Mexican food and better than average which is why this review has 3 stars.  If they made the ingredients better here this would be my go to for good priced Mexican food more often.  The margaritas are priced good, as are all other drinks, which makes this place a great spot for drinking a lot then having some Mexican food.    The reason this is a 3 star and not 2 is because I am a huge Mexican foodie.  I deducted 2 stars because the food could have some better ingredients and it is a chain restaurant.  Both are negatives in my book."}
{"text":"Terry, our server, was great. He made us aware of potential food allergies in what we ordered. They accommodated a large party. Food was great."}
{"text":"Pros: - Large portions. - $2 Dos Equis all the time. - Fast service.  Cons: - Loud music and a crazy amount of sprinklers outside on some nights. - The location and parking lot is a bit odd. - Employees will not leave you alone!  In the end, the $2 Dos Equis will bring me back again, but not really much else."}
{"text":"Wow...I've been going to macayo's, central phx, since 1978. They have messed my order up a few time, it happens, of course they did today. When they got my order wrong, like they do, I was supposed to be happy with them f...ing my order up. The idiot manager and server told me...\"will it's free and you should be happy.\" Nope I wanted my order right the 1st time. Don't go here! Stay on Mill ave for your food and fun."}
{"text":"Business is in process of a renovation; food & service were very good; for a Mexican restaurant, the decor, music and ambiance could be improved."}
{"text":"I decided to grab an appetizer and a drink after seeing Janelle Monae at the Marquee in January. Based on reviews, I didn't expect much, but my experience didn't even meet the meager expectations I had set going in.   The server, whose name I cannot recall, came to our table maybe twice outside of the initial order and serving of food. We had to wait forever for drink refills, the people who arrived later were forced to linger tirelessly while the server attended to the rest of the restaurant, which was roughly 2/3 empty.   We ordered several appetizers to start: Mini Chimichangas, Beef Taquitos, Fiesta Wings and Nachos Supreme. Every last bite we took of each item was mediocre-at-best and the chimi's were lukewarm by the time they arrived.   Upon venturing into Macayo's we all assumed we would order actual meals too but because of the slow, substandard service and the barely-edible food, we passed on entrees. We paid for our food and left.   Will not return."}
{"text":"I like Macayo's, the food is decent and the prices are reasonable.  This location is especially great for those times when you feel like getting out for more than just food.  Whenever you hit up Tempe check this place out, the depot has great party atmosphere with a gigantic patio for those perfect Phoenix nights.  The service could stand a little improvement.  The hostess and bartenders are super friendly but the wait staff needs a little extra familiarity with the menu and training concerning customer service."}
{"text":"**Amended** There was a very unfortunate oversight on a catering order which left us hungry and disappointed. That was remedied with immediate attention and customer service that blew me away, however. Which is a huge relief, because the food is fantastic and the atmosphere is really great and I was bummed at the idea of not eating there anymore. (Now I want guacamole)"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened, but had lunch yesterday here and the oil used to fry the tacos tasted very old. The meat was burnt on one of my tacos and everything was just poor quality, The service was great though, but will think long and hard before returning here."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this Macayo's in years. First off, the salsa. Looks authentic but really thin. A gluten free menu is a nice option tho.  Waiter did a nice up-sell on the Cuervo margarita, which I got. He did fail to ask if I liked them blended or on the rocks tho. My wife ordered a regular margarita and our guest got a soft drink.   For entrees, I ordered the BBQ Chipotle Tacos, my wife got the Roasted Tomatillo Spinach Fish Tacos and our guest ordered the California Burro.   My entree was well prepared, with plenty of chipotle sauce and filling. My wife's tacos were equally impressive. Our guest had a fairly neutral reaction to his rather plain looking burro. I think he was expecting more sauce, since it was pretty dry.   Service was cheerful and adequate for a slow night.   I recommend Macayo's for those who are uninitiated in Mexican food. They actually serve Tex-Mex but it is a good step into the Mexican cuisine for Easterners like our guest."}
{"text":"I wanted the Mexican experience and this has seen better days! The place was run down divvy and smelled of must. The food and drinks were a gelatinous muck!  GROSSSSSS!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty disgusting.  There has never been anything here that after I ate it I said \"Man am I glad I ate that\".  The happy hour is a good deal because you get beer and free gross food.  If you eat here, sit outside because it's nice to enjoy the warm AZ air, but bring Mylanta with you."}
{"text":"Cool place for the college crowd with the large patio and band playing... very cool.  Food is ok... but it's a chain.  I'm not much for rating chain food because it's the same at all of them.  One down point... the bathroom.  Girls restrooms are usually so clean... but this time, I walk in and it looked like a tornado hit the place.   If you're gonna serve savages, clean up after them."}
{"text":"I hate having to write this review, but I will stick to the facts!  The weather was beautiful last night, so thought we would ride the light rail to Tempe and enjoy some drinks and food on a patio.  I've always been intrigued by the Depot Cantina, so that is where we decided to go.  We found a nice table on the patio and we were off to a good start.  But, it all went downhill from there....the service was so terribly slow and she didn't really apologize for it.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and then another 10 to get our food order in...only because I asked another server to help us.  They cranked the music too loud and it caused it to cut in and out.  We told multiple servers multiple times that if they turned the music down it would go back to normal...took 30 minutes for that to be fixed.  The food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive.  The soup was spilled all over the plate beneath it and they just threw a few tortillas on my friend's burro...seriously no attention to detail in this place.  I can't imagine a manager was on duty last night because I can't imagine they would let the restaurant run this way.  I hope they get their act together because this place is in a great location with a large patio."}
{"text":"Ummm, the place was dead on a Saturday night. The bartenders were not attentive. We sat at the bar and service stunk! The bartenders seem to pick their customers and huddle their attention over them the whole time. Food is mediocre however I gotta hand it to their drinks. Awesome margaritas- 3 stars for that."}
{"text":"Great food.  Mini chimi appetizer was great as was the enchilada sampler.    Service slower than we care for.  Join the eVIP club for specials and coupons.    The decor is fun. Love the stained glass window panes of old cars."}
{"text":"Been eating here since I was a kid and I LOVE it despite the fact that it is always busy. This restaurant has a lot of memories for me. The food is really great, though not as authentic as some of the hole-in-the-wall Mexican food places scattered around Arizona. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I'm a flight attendant and was in PHX on a layover this week.  A local friend recommended Macayo's.  After reading the reviews here I was skeptical of trying it.  I have to say I was really pleased with it.  I received great customer service.  The food was really good and who can complain with $2 beers and a nice patio?  I ordered the fried green tamale appetizer and it was really good.  I liked the chips and salsa.  The table next to me ordered the poblano chicken and the baja burrito and they looked really good from my vantage point.  I would def. go back."}
{"text":"Was here for a catered meal and I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked sitting on the patio out front and the service was very friendly and efficient.  The chips and guacamole were delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with our friends for a birthday. What happen?  Our server terry was not on top of it at all and the food was baaaad.  The other server actually told us the bartender sucks, so only order beer and shots. Of course she was right. The margarita my hubby ordered was rank.  Get it together guys and we might come back. Hate that we wasted so much money there with our group."}
{"text":"Hostess was great & friendly,  took the server 15 minutes on an almost empty restaurant to come & knowledge us after someone INTRUPTED the servers gathering!  Visiting Tempe to see our son at ASU, 2nd & last time at this place. Only had 3 request, no ice in my water, ceviche no spicy if possible & a house Margherita!  None was done, I had to ask someone else for Margherita half way through dinner. The server Gina, got her 20% tip I'm not blaming her it's the management who did not teach them right. Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Call me nuts.. but on a recent 'have to' visit to my corporate office near here.... we decide its just hot...and what a way to shake off the corporate blues of come what may then with a few margs... amongst the collegiates... As I started, call me nuts... Its Tempe.. I dont usually ... I just say, no. Neat patio...but too hot... we opted to get our drink on inside.. the place was hopping even at 2pm.. amongst the 6 or so of us... we had a few margaritas..a few apps, a few taco and enchilada plates... I stuck with a cheese crisp and margarita...lite on the salt, please. Strong..well, strong enough for me. Truly, I liked everything... Its a chain and I was surprised.. The waiter, could have been more attentive and a bit nicer, as the hostesses. And some of our party complained that the food came out a bit on the lukewarm side...Im going with the fact that our party wasnt small... and its Tempe.."}
{"text":"Just called your published telephone number and it rang 25 times and no one answered.  Trying to reserve the patio area for late May for a small gathering of friends and family for a retirement celebration."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff! I always love grabbing some delicious Mexican food here. It was my go-to in college and that hasn't changed. I recommend the poblano hash browns and chorizo burrito off the breakfast menu...and anything for lunch and dinner! Oh, and the margs are the best in Tempe."}
{"text":"I have visited this location a number of times and always get great service. The staff is very friendly and always tentative to our table. I have ordered food from this location many times with big orders for catering and have always been very pleased with the food and the timeliness of my order. They always have great drink specials and I love that they have such a big sitting outer area."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. It has gone downhill rapidly. The food has become typical trendy food, available almost anywhere, rather than the favorites that have stood the test of time.  The Marguritas used to be among the best. They are now watered down to the point I can hardly taste any alcohol in them. I no longer eat here, and I miss the old Macayo's."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews! I love Macayos. The food is great, and the service is great. Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey - one margarita being upwards $8-11 but happy hour is great and if you ask they sometimes have drink specials like 2 for $14 margaritas.   If I had to recommend a meal I would recommend the chimicanga con queso - yum yum yum.   Get a beer or a margarita and just sit back enjoy the awesome atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this Macayo's frequently when I worked in downtown Tempe. Usually pretty good. Had dinner there last night and was so disappointed. The fajitas were altogether quite flavorless. The steak on the fajitas was tough. We were splitting the dish between 2 of us and they brought us 2 small 6\" tortillas. Had to ask for more and the server looked at us like we had no reason to need more."}
{"text":"We had to bus our own table. After asking for someone to take our order like 10 times, they did only to tell us (after we asked where our drinks were 45 min later) our order wasn't entered because they are too busy. \"Sorry, there is nothing I can do.\" We left with nothing after sitting here for an hour and a half. Worst service and  business management EVER."}
{"text":"I've been going to Macayo's Depot Cantina since college and its a great place. Friendly people, great food, and some good specials you can't find at other locations. They have some really good margaritas too!  I go there for lunch at least once a week.  The specials change daily for lunch so you can mix it up.  I love the chips and salsa they bring out when you sit down and our orders always come out quickly.  You definitely leave full!  They also have a great happy hour that my friends and I go to on Fridays."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to cater for business meetings, birthdays and graduations this Macayo's location should be your front runner. I've ordered fiesta players, taco platters, fruit platters and rice pans in the past and always had the same great experience. Ordering is easily done over the phone and payment is done while picking up the order. The prices are fairly decent. The food is always delicious. My only problem is that the customer service is not always the same. There has been poor customer service a few times and other times above and beyond support. It's never consistent. Overall, I would recommend this place for catering needs."}
{"text":"I CAN\"T BELIEVE IT...Macayo's comes through again!  My team completely forgot to order lunch for a VERY important meeting of 35 people, and didn't notice until 70 minutes before the meeting started. NOT GOOD!  I called up Jeff Rhodes and he TOTALLY made it happen...like, seriously, I don't even know how they pulled it off, but they did.  I have known Jeff for a long time and we have done a lot of catering and business together, but this was insanely above and beyond amazing customer service, this was a flat out miracle. Now we have 35 people enjoying delicious Mexican food, all because of Jeff and his team's incredible efforts to make it happen.  THANKS A MILLION!"}
{"text":"Pretty average except for the nice patio.  The blackened ahi tacos were forgettable.  So many better places to eat Mexican in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in Macayo's in Tempe today after attending the Jersey Boys at ASU Gamage. The service was very attentive & our server got everything right and answered all our questions. The food was very good no complaints amoung the 4 of our party. The building is showing it's age though..could use some painting & updates. I do reccond this location for a good Mexican meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had a rough week and I decided today to take him out for a happy hour. Richie was our server and he was wonderful. His customer service was impecable and professional. He was polite at all times. Made the margarita the way I liked it. He offer the menu and brought the  food on s timely manner. He kept our table neat and checking if we wanted anything else without being pushy or fake. We had a chimichanga which was delicious. Three beers two margaritas, baseball game, and a great customer service this definitely Cher up the mood. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had a late night dinner at Macayo's. It was a very big place, and I went to sit at the \"bar\" area in the back with a friend of mine.   We ordered two margaritas (mmm) and chicken chile burros. The service was good, the burros were good, and the margaritas definitely were good. Chips and salsa came with the order. Our waiter was kind as well.  The reason why I gave this place four stars instead of five was because the atmosphere was fairly loud, and I couldn't have much of a conversation with my friend. To be fair, it was a Friday night, and there were many people there. I would recommend coming here with a large group, because Macayo's can definitely accommodate many customers in their large areas."}
{"text":"This is the place! Of all the Mexican joints in Arizona we get taken here! That's white people for you. The food wasn't bad, just boring as boring could be. Would have gotten a lesser rating but the service was really good. Like noticeably REALLY good."}
{"text":"We have always been partial to Macayos because the food is very good. The Spinach Con Queso is the best. I ate here today and had the Ahi Tacos for the first time. They were absolutely fabulous. This paticular Macayos location is my favorite. It has a large patio area and is a great place to go for drinks."}
{"text":"I would like to give a shout out to Bryan...he was very courteous and attentive, and his customer service cannot be beat. The food was amazing and I had some great laughs with friends and I have nothing to complain about because he took very good care of us! The server was on point, brought us chips and salsa and our drinks were never to the bottom of the glass. If you have a lunch hour to kill...this is the spot to be because you will be well taken care of, plus the food is really good. Thank you Bryan for keeping up to your word, you are an asset to that company and epitome to how all managers should be."}
{"text":"Macayo's and I are no strangers. I've eaten at their locations all over town. And when i discovered a Macayo's near the job site I was visiting, it made lunch an easy decision.  It's pretty clear that I love Mexican food. And I appreciate the regional variations, as well as the degrees of authenticity. I would never claim that Macayo's is the most authentic restaurant, but I will happily proclaim its consistency. No matter the surroundings, in this case a train depot theme, the menu offers variety, value and lots of delicious options.  If I had the time, I would've ordered my favorite appetizer, the Green Corn Tamale Bites. The dipping sauce is outrageous! But I digress.  I actually found the Macayo's Depot Cantina by accident. I parked in their lot. So while I'm the area, I made my way over and ordered a simple, but satisfying lunch special. It was Monday so I got the Quesadilla with some rice and beans. The portion was good and I got my daily cheese quota covered.  The decor was a little different from other locations, but I liked it. Especially the rail cars and cabooses sitting out back. It's close enough to work that I'll probably drag along some co-workers next time. Gracias!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite, but if you have to go for a business lunch definitely try the soup & salad combo or chicken salad. Skip the burritos for it's mainly filled with bland rice."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the patio during the nice months here in AZ its a great place to grab a drink for happy hour. The lunch specials are reasonable they have items from $6.99, 7.99, 8.99 and up. With the free chips and salsa i find that a $6.99 item and a water is just enough. Their menu had advertised $2.00 bottle beer which was a nice treat for lunch. I've tried their nachos and Bravo burro which both were decent, nothing special some of the $6.99 items don't come w rice and beans so pay attn. The service is good if your in a hurry for lunch it wont be a issue to get in and out plus the place is located a block off Mill ave and close to a light rail stop."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Tempe and Peoria. I always get the red corn chicken taquitos and the ground beef enchilada. The chips and salsa are also very tasty. If you're used to authentic homemade Mexican food this may not be as good because it is more of a chain restaurant. However I still feel their food is well seasoned and they give you good portions  I would pass one the fried ice cream though for dessert, for the price not worth it, just make it at home"}
{"text":"Good food.  Nice outdoor seating..... but not super clean.  Bathrooms were filthy.  Shouldn't have any thing to do with the food, but hard to overlook.  Service was great.  Warm nice.  Cold beer. Tacos.  What else is there in life???"}
{"text":"Food was great.  The Bomb Burrito was enough for 3 people.  Usually when things are big, they aren't very good this was an exception.  Stuffed Jalapeños were good also.  Service was not good.  We waited almost 20 minutes for our waitress to come back and take our order.  That was after we had to go in and ask for someone to come take our order.  Mistakes happen and the food warrants a return trip."}
{"text":"I don't understand how two waiters and even a manager can't make a simple corn quesadilla. I was told by all three I'm sorry we can't do that for you. I told them I will pay whatever the price I just want a corn tortilla folded with melted cheese but apparently the cooks can't make that in the back. I get it I worked at a Mexican restaurant in fact many restaurants so when you ask for something not on  the menu it gets tricky but you have corn tortillas you have cheese just melt it for me and put it on a plate, I will pay full price even if it is smaller but when you tell me you can't well sorry. And when you do decide to make it you literally just place it in front me after telling me you can't and don't say anything. And when I try to pay for it because its not On the bill waiter says don't worry about it and rolls his eyes. Cool dude I wasn't not trying to pay I just don't understand how someone can't put cheese in a tortilla and melt it."}
{"text":"I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't \"feel\" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch."}
{"text":"We had a nice leisurely lunch of 10 ladies. Food was good, service suited our dynamic,  and we were all made to feel welcome."}
{"text":"I've never considered this to be anything other than a lunch destination.  It was an ok one for that purpose.    Like the others have mentioned, they give you chips just like every other Mexican restaurant you will ever enter, they serve your usual bad pseudo-mexican beer, and some fairly edible food served on a plate."}
{"text":"Rating this place could go any number of ways, depending on where you sit. Due to the roundabout way in which we entered, we managed to experience a little bit of everything here.  My wife and I agreed to meet the in-laws here on a Friday night in order to hand off our daughter for the evening. They got to the restaurant long before we did in order to enjoy happy hour with some of their co-workers. So, when we entered, we did so through the patio area.  At first glance, the patio seems amazing. It's extremely large, has awesome seating, and has full bar. There were awesome heaters throughout in order to remove some of the evening desert nip out of the air. By the entrance, there was a DJ. His music was definitely quite loud, but I figure that's to be expected.  After just a few minutes, I figured out why the DJ had his music turned up so loud. As I was looking up at the stars along the back wall of the patio, everything on the patio seemed to go completely mute. An airplane passed by overhead that sounded like it was coming from the bar! It was SO loud!   Thankfully, once we arrived, the in-laws wanted to head inside for dinner. While we were at the hostess' stand, I took a look around. The place seems to have been decorated by a child. There are random nick-knacks absolutely EVERYWHERE. Steering wheel hanging from a ceiling fan? Check! Inflatable monkey hanging from a different ceiling fan? Why not? There's really no rhyme or reason to any of the decor...though, maybe that's what they were going for. It does seem to be a place geared more towards the younger crowd.  Decor aside, making the move to eating indoors turned out to be a wise one. Our server was fantastic. She was knowledgeable and extremely polite. In spite of the fact that the place was extremely crowded, the food arrived super fast. I can only speak for my meal, but my Baja Chicken Burro was quite delicious. It had just the right amount of spice to it, and it was massive! I could only comfortably eat half of the thing before throwing in the towel and springing for the to-go box.  Great service, good food, gimicky decor, and SUPER loud patio. If you can get past the bad, the good is pretty good."}
{"text":"I was enroute to some friends and wanted to pick up some Macayos ( i worked at the central phx location years ago) on my way there, I called them, put my order in, and told them they had to bring it out to the parking lot due to car engine issues.  James was on top of it, within minutes he came out with my food, took my cc and brought me back the receipt.  Food was delicious (very expensive though....red burro, green tamale and a appetizer platter  $32.00 plus a $5.00 tip) James was great though, I love Macayos....even though it is getting to be a bit expensive. Thanks James"}
{"text":"My friends and I had such a fantastic time at Macayo's Depot Cantina.  I actually served there for many years, and have always been a huge fan of the food.  It is delicious.  It is authentic.  It is consistently dynamite.  I can't say enough about the high quality of the food... Macayo's just never disappoints.  What I never got to appreciate as an employee there is what an incredible and lively atmosphere it is to dine in.  The patio is a blast.  There are lots of people, good music, plenty of shade, misters when it's hot, tv's to watch the games on, and servers on top of their game.  When our meal was finished, we cruised inside to the cantina where the atmosphere was just as energetic and buzzing.  They've got an impressive selection of tequilas and killer margaritas to enjoy.  The bartenders and cocktailers always seemed to be smiling.  Overall, the service was outstanding, the food delicious as always, and the atmosphere great.  My friends and I keep Macayo's Depot Cantina on our list of regular stops when we choose to hit up Tempe."}
{"text":"Oh, Macayo's you used to be so great.     I have been to Depot Cantina many times and it used to be my favorite place to get dinner and drinks before heading out on Mill Ave. But over the years it has really started to decline. Our server was nice but not very informed or attentive.    I was extremely disappointed in the food. The salsa tasted like someone accidentally dumped a bag of salt in it and my  veggie fajitas only had broccoli, carrots and zucchini. It wouldn't have been so bad if there were sautéed onions and bell peppers to go with but nothing about it said \"Mexican food.\"  Food aside, I have to say that the entertainment was really good. It was one guy and a guitar who sang Boys In The Hood by Easy E and Lovesong by Cure (or Adele depending on how old you are).  I am sure that I will be back at least for drinks but I hope that they work on improving the evening service, Depot Cantina is a staple in Tempe and I would hate to see it go any further downhill."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Please do not go here. The place is dirty, the service run by a bunch of college kids and the food is below average at best. My first glass of \"wine\" came with a glass full of lipstick. And that was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"came here to watch a game in the bar...  the waitress was super sweet and drinks were poured heavy and were quite tasty, but it took us forever to get our food. there were people that ordered way after we did that got their food before we did... thanks goodness for the chips and salsa!!  great atmosphere for a lot of people and the patio is nice and big!! would love to come back again to give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a business trip for the 3rd time this year and was excited to take my coworkers here as it was delicious last time. I think this place just keeps going down hill. First time I came it was fantastic! Second time, food was great but service wasnt spectacular. This time was terrible!   We sat in the bar, when we showed up there were only 3 or 4 other parties. The bartender, Ben was our server too. There was another gentleman serving as well. It wasn't busy at all. We got our beers right away, but took a while to order our food. Food came out pretty quickly 15 - 20 minutes. After we got our food we were not checked on. We did get our beers filled though. Ben kept running into the back of my chair everytime he passed by and never said a word to me. It became quite annoying. No one was even sitting behind me. He wasn't very personable either. I was also charged for a side of burrito sauce, 1.99. I understand when restaurants charge for guacamole or sour cream but for a base sauce? I only wanted a teaspoon to flavor my bland burrito that I got.   It took us about 25 minutes to get our checks and cash out as well.   Food is mediocre, but service is beyond terrible. It's unfortunate because they have a great venue, but no friendly staff. I probably won't go again while visiting in the future."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! We went for dinner Sunday, late afternoon so not particularly busy. The weather was beautiful so we sat on the patio and got ignored. Food was only so-so, and the waiter neglected to bring silverware. We had to go to the hostess station to request that, then back to the station to request drink refills, then again to get our ticket. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"When you sit around and have a debate about whether or not this was the worst Mexican food you've ever had, well, that exemplifies what kind of experience this was.  We went on Cinco de Mayo, and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to. I thought that at 5pm, we could slip in, grab a table in the bar, grab food and beverage and get on our way.  To be quick, and to the point, the service was good, but the food was absolutely garbage. Bland, flat, uninspired...   Between the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop), the 20 year old manager, and the horrific food, I'll go out of my way to not go here again."}
{"text":"We stopped in recently for dinner before a concert. We choose to sit outside since the weather was so nice. The hostess sat us at a table and went over the drink specials and one other special that was on the table tents on the table. My boyfriend and I both took notice at how well she did that without feeling like she was selling you on anything. My boyfriend works in the industry on the corporate side and we were shocked at how well she did. Then our server came and again so friendly! We were going to order a margarita and we asked about the tequila options and again in a non-selling way she suggested the margaritas on special so we had those! We placed our dinner order and even the food runner was awesome! We were just amazed at the quality of service from everyone we had any interaction with. As we were paying the bill we asked to speak to the manager so we could let him know what a fantastic job everyone did. Again, fantastic job to them all!!!! Oh, and the food was great as well!!! We will certainly be back again soon!"}
{"text":"After work, I was invited to the MacAyo happy hour, enticed with free food. After riding my bike about 7 miles and not successfully finding a bike rack (locked it to the gate in the back), I attacked the buffet. A lactose-intolerant vegetarian, I loaded up on salad, tortilla chips, quac and beans. It is totally gringo-even I can tell, but it hit the spot and I didnt have to hit the toilet as the true cost of \"free food\" later. The drink specials were decent (got a Dos Equis glass, then cheap refills) and the large group just chilled out.   The real star was the MUSIC. Dude-they were playing VIDEOS of top 40 hip hop AND old-school. Fucking \"Poison\", \"Humpty Dance\", and \"OPP\"? All right by me. The crowd disappeared by like 8 something onto real dinner or getting ready for their real night out (like all of us were).   This place I wouldn't go out of the way for-but to hang out with friends with cheap booze, simple fatty eats, ample seating and early 90s jamz in Tempe? Not bad."}
{"text":"We went to the central location the night before, and had such a good time, enjoyed our experience so much, we just had to try another, in this historical location (Depot Cantina) Food was great again, had nachos with the Baja sauce (so good), portions were HUGE, we took 3 completely filled boxes home, service was again, amazing. From the moment we walked in Ashley (the host) was upbeat, energetic and friendly. She sat us and we had Terry as our server. He was veg friendly, accurate, and knowledgable. We also got to talk to Marco a couple of times, who delivered our margaritas, and he was cool and funny. Another amazing experience."}
{"text":"I must say, Macayos has been hit or miss with me. I've had rather decent experiences, while many of my friends have had varying experiences. Some good, some bad.   Today, me and a group of three others decided to come and eat, and, while we were generally pleased with the food, the service was less pleasing great. Our server, definitely didn't provide the best service for various reasons, but, worst of all, he managed to upsale us multiple extras without telling us that these extras had an additional costs. He plainly asked if we wanted cheese, sour cream, and avocados, with our meals, without any indication these would cost extra. We were surprised and mentioned it after we saw the bill and he seemed more confused and just apologized before leaving and finishing the tab. He mentioned if it happened again to go to the manager, which confused us since he was the one who caused the problem.  I'm not sure if he was trying to increase his tip or was instructed by management to upscale subtly, but I found it deceptive and disappointing. I've worked at multiple restaurants and have many family members who are high up in the restaurant industry, and this sort of practice doesn't fly in most establishments. If you come here, be wary of what you order and of what your server asks if you'd like with your meal, and don't be surprised if they soon start charging for refills on water."}
{"text":"It's my favorite Macayo's location! It's right by light rail tracks in the center of tempe. I always bring Cha Cha (the souvenir cup) and get it filled for a special price. The Cheese Crisp and the enchiladas are awesome! I came here for my birthday dinner and it was awesome! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"on a hot day after riding the greenbelt several miles with our trusty mugs, macayo's is always a pleasure. the happy hour food was ok, but we were starving so it satisfied. i have to say....our mugs are cheaper for drinks, but you have to tell them to lay off the ice. there's so much in there, it seems like you only get a little margarita and a ton of ice....marketing ploy? hmmm......"}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect it judging by the exterior/interior design and the corny iridescent spanish colors, but the flavors were for the most part authentic and tasty.  I ordered the Chile Relleno and taco combo which came with rice and beans.  The plate was more than enough for one person.  The rice was light and flavorful -- even the beans which I don't typically eat were good.  My friend ordered the carne asada burrito and it just didn't compare to the combo.  Definitely go with the combos here."}
{"text":"High-quality food & service! The quesadillas were absolutely delicious and the margaritas were amazing! I'm impressed, which is saying something because I live in San Antonio, so my threshold for quality Mexican is high."}
{"text":"Ordered a ground beef (much better than their shredded beef btw) chimichang online.  Was SO GOOD! The sopapillas were delicious too! Excited to order again. I paid a dollar more for the grande special or something, it added guacamole and was worth every penny. I tried the shredded beef chimichanga in the shredded beef had a lot of fat in it which was really gross, and there was hardly any meat. The ground beef is where it's at, way better portion size and a cleaner taste."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here and I grabbed a table for us while my boyfriend went outside to find some friends we were meeting up with. While I was sitting at the table and just got chips/drinks when I felt something brush up against my leg. I look down and sure enough there is a rat that climbed half way up my leg and then scurried off behind the bar. I didn't make a scene and waited for my boyfriend to come back so that I could tell him we needed to leave. The waiter approached us and could tell something was off and I privately disclosed to him that there was a rat. He said \"oh well if you told me that after you got your food I could have given you a discount, sorry\". We didn't even stay long enough to order anything and left. Unfortunately I will not be returning, I used to love to go to this place after ASU games. This experience definitely ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Um, no.  What do you do with a beautiful old train depot? You fill it with so much color it looks like Sherwin Williams barfed in every corner. IT so 1980's, so falsely cute. I just loathe the interior.  To be fair, my chicken pablano was reasonably good and the server was steady. But the atmospherics are deigned to wow unsophisticated frat boys from the nearby U. No thanks."}
{"text":"Hi Macayo's!  Hats off to you to having consistent and delicious Mexican food! I'd say that the price is good for the area, the chips and salsa are great, and the food, even though it is not some fancy shmancy Mexican food, it's great tasting.  I'm so unsure as to why someone wouldn't give this place at least three stars. I typically go at lunch too or after work for a margarita and I'm always quickly taken care of and I'm not sure what else you can ask for.  Also, Jose is the best bartender. They should keep him forever."}
{"text":"Great for a college meat market skin bar. Not where I'd take the fam.  =============== Updated 09-27-11  After three or four more trips I've decided to stop going here.  Every time I eat here I spend the rest of the day in the restroom.  Not pleasant.  I suspect they have cleanliness and sanitation issues in the kitchen there.  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK - I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Okay so I really didn't eat here, but I think the atmosphere is great!  Live music, rowdy crowd, and ESPN - on top of that daily drink specials ...WT Funk!  What else can a guy ask for...hmmm we'll leave that alone.  This place is huge, it's almost a maze to walk around, I tell if you were drunk make sure you have a friend with you.  Don't want you walking past the lightrail tracks as the lightrail is coming :)  If you need a place to hang with a pal or two come on down!"}
{"text":"Ask for Ben if you go to the bar.  He'll make sure you leave happy.  He turned my yucky drink into the best. Having another one."}
{"text":"No bueno. I'm not a fan of chains to begin with, so when my fiance told me he wanted to spend his birthday here I was less than thrilled with his decision. I had made a reservation for a surprise party and our hostess was less than secretive when I brought my fiance through the door. She just pointed and said \"Yeah, they're in there\" -thus giving away with the fact that others were waiting for him. We were then greeted by our server. The first thing out of his mouth was \"You guys splitting checks?\" We were. He then told us \"K. Make sure to not move around the table then. You'll make it confusing for me\". I started to feel guilty about sitting in his section. Like we had done something wrong. Anytime we asked him for anything he replied with an annoyed look on his face and said \"Yeah, give me a minute\". Over and over. He left the table before getting everyone's drink order, forgot things, and we had to one person's food through the manager. In short, he sucked.   Shotty service aside, the food was AWFUL also. I ordered the Steak Cortez and every bite was pure fatty nastiness. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place!! Greg and Dillon the bartenders are fantastic, pour GREAT margaritas! Owner stopped by to visit, very fun and nice. Couldn't have been better!!"}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday party on a Thursday evening. ASU is not back in full force yet so it was fairly quiet. For a 20+ group I thought the service was pretty good. We were in a separate room. I've had better fish tacos at some of the 'bertos around town. The refried beans were fine. Best food of the meal for me was the side of calabacitas, diced stir fried veggies."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? This was our college hang out. I stopped in for a happy hour with my college buddies... NOT the same. The happy hour buffet SUCKED! We ended up ordering appetizers. They tasted ok... Not much of a drink special. Oh, we were very disappointed... I guess the next college get together will be somewhere else..."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places for Mexican. Disappointed that they took the lunch portion fajitas off the lunch menu, that used to be perfectly priced and portioned. Opted to try the fajita bowl instead. Pretty weird. Doesn't come with fajita vegetables I guess. Should just call it a meat/bean/rice bowl. My boyfriend got one of the lunch combos. There was a bone in his taco. His beef taco. Needless to say, might have been our last Macayo's venture."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday a few weeks ago, for their happy hour. We sat outside and they were very accommodating as we kept adding 2-3 people at a time, ending with about 13 people total. Jackie was our cocktail waitress, and with the amount of happy hour shots, margaritas and appetizers we ordered she kept track if everyone's individual orders and didn't mess up on anything. she was awesome! kind of a long wait for drinks if they are busy but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We attended a reception here in one of the meeting rooms. They had a margarita fountain with mango syrup and strawberry syrup if you prefer flavors to plain margaritas. It was fun to make your own and yummy to drink. The food was good it came out frequently so it was not all sitting there for too long in between people eating it. We had a blast"}
{"text":"Food is good. Outside patio is nice.  The service is a lil bad. And the overpriced margaritas aren't worth the price they charge. But it's a decent place for lunch.  Oh and the music is awful. Nothing but 96.9 garbage pop music"}
{"text":"Lady at front said we can sit anywhere and she'd follow us. Guy server checked in on us, got us water and took 15 mins to come back... Then I realized he was waiting both areas by himself for about 30mins...looks like they gave him some help. I see he was doing the best he could, brought the 3 star back to a 4 star...ask for Kamran, he can be my waiter anytime."}
{"text":"That means everything Awesome food Lots of food Fast delivery service Sad that we don't have one in California But definitely next time to come to Arizona will be my first stop Ahh also the salsa is to die for.."}
{"text":"Yummy taquitos!  Great atmosphere, felt like I was in Mexico.  Happy hour is pretty decent.  Would love to come back at night to see how crowded it gets."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. I almost got lost it is so big, I love the patio and it feels like I am in Mexico. The server was extremely friendly and my friend ordered for me (I was running late on lunch hour) and the server actually made me my own dish even though it was not on the menu.   Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is what brings people in & it's also probably what keeps them coming back.... that & the strong drinks, lol.   There's a large patio, but for me it wasn't a big lure because it was hot outside. It was only 90, so maybe when it gets to 100 they have misters? Who knows :)  My sister had a margarita & from where I sat, across the table, it was burning my nose, lol!  For an appetizer we had the guacamole. It could have used a squeeze of lime, but other than that it was good! Fresh.  For my main dish I opted for the blackened mahi tacos, which had a 2 chili rating, the highest on the menu. I was expecting hot, but it was barely mild. The ahi itself was good. On the menu it said it came with pineapple pico de gallo & tomatillo salsa. I got neither. I asked for the pineapple pico de gallo. It was so disappointing! Bland & not fresh. I don't think these 2 corn tortilla tacos were worth $15. I chose not to have the beans and rice the tacos come with, but if you want to get full you'd probably need to keep those :)   My sister got the California burrito and she loved it. Maybe I'll give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"i would say this place is pretty good.  granted it was a monday night but i was almost the only other person there.  i ate at the bar and the bartender was very nice though.  the fajitas are so-so but the special margarita was pretty good though.  I will have to try on a more popular night to see if it is fun."}
{"text":"I'm not super set on the food choices at this location but the service and drink options were really great! I came here for drinks with a friend and got the margarita flight! It was a super fun idea and I loved being able to try different flavors. The prickly pear was my favorite! Some were a little heavy on the syrup."}
{"text":"Went to Macayo's on Ash in Tempe with a large (14) post graduation group. Outdoor patio was great. Food was very good; chile relleno and green chili burrito were particularly big hits. Food came quickly and just as ordered. Server Gina was outstanding and really helped make this a special occasion. Would definitely recommend for a large group event."}
{"text":"Just not a fan. I've never liked Macayo's not sure if it's the  type of mex food (and I'm fanatic), or what. Stuck to tacos and margarita (just one, thank you). We had 2 ppl the server and a trainee."}
{"text":"We drove a good half hour to eat at Macayo's in Tempe. Very disappointed that the Scottsdale location was closed. Scottsdale location was always on point and perfect. Food was outstanding this visit. But they have a huge management problem at this location. Coming from someone with a degree in hotel/restaurant management and who owned a restaurant i would immediately replace the General Manager here. Our food took forever to get to us. The waiter was rarely seen because it seemed he had tables scattered all over the place rather than in a specific section. The manager did come over to let us know they had a mix up in the kitchen and they were making our order now. By the time the food got to the table 45 minutes had passed. 4 entrees at 1:45pm on 12/22 with maybe a total of 5 tables in the place is disappointing. We all ordered chimichangas. 2 Baja, 1 Woody's original, and a kids combo platter. My daughters food did come with the side of French fries like we ordered. But our chimichangas did not come with any side at all despite us ordering rice with them. When the waiter returned to check on everything we asked for the rice that had been forgotten. The rice never came at all. Nor did the manager come back to see how things were. If I were running the place I would have triple checked the food leaving the kitchen to make sure the order was correct and I would have gone over as a manager knowing there had already been a mistake to make sure everything was perfect. The manger did remove 50% off the bill which I did not ask for. All I wanted was an apology and a explanation. I appreciate the gesture of the discount but I would have preferred him coming over. He just had our server tell us... I tipped the server at 20% of the full bills value with out the 50% discount and we left. I don't think we will be going back at all. It's to far and certainly not worth it..."}
{"text":"I have been a Macayos customer for over 40 years. I have eaten at many of their locations around the valley. After all these years they changed the menu, stopped offering favorite combos, raised prices. And now charge extra for things that used to be part of the entry. Very disappointed. May go to other places."}
{"text":"I visited Macayo's because I heard that they had a gluten-free menu.   We sat outdoors on the cute, pleasant patio. The environment was somewhat marred by the presence of cigarette smoke. I know business owners can accept smoking on patios, but they can also choose to make patios smoke-free, and I find the latter much more pleasant.   Service was pretty good, but our server did seem in a hurry to get us out of there. Although it was 3 hours before close, she started asking if we wanted to-go boxes about 15 minutes after we got our food.    I had beef fajitas and my partner had a burro. We also ordered guacamole. The guacamole tasted kind of gummy, and the chips were too dry, papery, and flavorless. Also, we found cucumbers in the guacamole, and later in the pico de gallo. Who puts a freaking cucumber in either of those things?  My fajitas were very bland in flavor. The meat was cheap and had been chemically tenderized, with the result that the texture was pulpy. Instead of seared, it was just browned. It looked as though it had been steamed in a microwave, to be honest. Also, they used too much tenderizer, and it took the top skin off of my tongue. Gross.   Refried beans tasted kind of cakey. Otherwise ok. Again, guac was gummy with a strange taste.   My partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor.   We asked about flan, but learned that it contains gluten. There is ZERO reason that flan should contain any gluten, so I am guessing their flan was made from some kind of mix. Again, gross.   I won't be returning to Macayo's."}
{"text":"Came here before an ASU game, it was slammed.  Sat in the bar at a pub table and was not waited on, had to go to the bartender after 15 minutes and told him what pub table I was sitting at.  He was pleasant and under the circumstances, no fault to him the place was spread thin.  So he had to come out from the bar to help serve, it was a given our plates wouldn't be picked up cuz the bar was busy.  The carne asada tacos were just ok, not much flavor, I did like the beans veggies.  Horrible ownership and management for something like this to happen.  The service was as bad as I ever had, again not by the server, but there was not waitresses or waiters, never heard such a thing."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, although I wasn't expecting much from the overall reviews.  The margarita was good, but too sweet.  The rice tasted good, but was overcooked and slightly clumpy.  The refried beans and red beans were cooked well, and the baja carne beef chimichanga was great.  Service was fine, prices were reasonable (large entree and margarita = $22), and atmosphere in the outdoor seating was nice.  Tons of Mexican places out here I'd like to still try, but I wouldn't dismiss this place if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like all fun and games.  $2 beer, a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour.  Whats not to like right?  Unfortunately the music is way 2 loud when you get in.  Its really difficult to have a conversation.  The free food has made me sick on more than 1 occasion.  The service is slow to the point that I usually go to the bar to order a beer.  I would give this place at least 3 stars if they turned down the music a couple of notches."}
{"text":"A very good chain experience. We've been here a few times while visiting and have never been disappointed with either service or food. I had the tamales which were just the right firmness (hate soggy cornmeal) and the sides were very good. It's kinda formula restaurant, but they do it very well. We were with family, and a large party and our waiter was right on to taking care of us. All in all, not a bad stop!"}
{"text":"We ran out of salsa early on were never offered a refill. Food was good, cant really mess up shrimp tacos, and chicken fajitas.We each had not one but two house mango margaritas, that were the WEAKEST drinks I have ever had, totally under poured. Then my mother in law ordered a patron margarita, it was OVER poured? Poor bar staff to say the least. Maybe some additional training is needed there to learn what a standard 2oz pour is. I am really upset over half our bill  was tequila-less juice."}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the shrimp and beef fajitas that comes with a side of refried beans, sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo and flour tortillas. It was awesome and cooked just right! We were more than pleased with AJ's excellent service for our party of 11. The only downside was the patio that could use some daily cleaning. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I finally ate lunch here after not being able to get decent parking for Quiznos on Mill Ave.  My coworker and I were starving and needed a place to shoot the shit so we decided to give it a try.  I really did enjoy the patio area.  The weather was amazing and I had cabin fever from being stuck in my office all morning attending boring meetings.  They do hand out the free chips and salsa (glad it was free b/c they weren't tasty enough to actually pay for).  I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a good portion and I didn't get sick so I was happy.  The wait staff seemed so busy yet there weren't that many people in the restaurant but we are talking about a college crew so I can forgive them for their lack of detail and attention.   Macayos isn't my favorite \"Cantina\" but I'm sure it will hit the spot on another beautiful day when I need to unwind in the warm sun.  I'm giving it 3 stars based on the open patio, good parking and the fact I didn't have to ride the porcelain bus later that day."}
{"text":"Good margaritas , excellent service and of couse decent mexican food!  My Favorites are, Ahi tacos ( Very spicy) and Verde Shrimp Enchiladas...! Good place to visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Margarita before the concert. I loved the layout of this place. Very unique. We were one of four people there but the bartender, Mike, was very cool."}
{"text":"loooooooooooove this place-and it only gets better!!  all the people who complain about the atmosphere of this place is CRAZY !! its so awesome!!  i used to work here in 1999 back when i was in college and we had the patio, but it looked nothing like the way it does now!  it's a complete oasis in the desert!  i've been to a fair share of mexi restaurants living in az and cali for the past 10 years, and this place is by far THE BEST!!  the food here is sooooooo good!  i literally crave their food when  im home in cali and when i come to az, as all my friends will attest, i'm all about going to macayos.  on this particular trip, i made my husband stop there on our way home so i could order my favorite meal (spinach enchilada and green corn tamale combo plate with extra baha on the side) in addition to con queso dip and extra tamales.  they have THE BEST HANDS DOWN tamales i have ever tasted EEEEVVVEEEER in my whole life. people look at me sideways when i say that, asking if i've ever had them hommade from mexis. ya, i have. macayos is sooo much better. completely rocks my socks off. their tamales are moist and spicy and cheesy and FRIGGN AWESOME. every other tamale i have ever tried has been dry and nowhere near as moist or sweet corny.  maybe they make them different, non traditional or something, i dunno, all i know is tha tthey are the most amazing food to ever touch my lips. yes, you can quote me on that.   and the baha sauce....mmm...the baha sauce! im convinced its chock full of msg because i am psychotically addicted to it.  i guess its a good thing they dont have a macayos near me because i would be a baha eating freak, so i'd be as fat as a cow. i seriously, no joke, would BEG for a job here so i could get the food discount. i should know, as i said, i used to work here. but again, there's the cow issue, so moving on...the baha has always been good, but this time it wasn't as spicy or as good as i remembered. i'm not holding it against them tho, it could have been the batch.  and everyone is absolutely correct about the margs-they are the best around no doubt. they are the strongest and most tasty i've ever had. same price as chilis or any of those places and a whole lot better. and who doesnt like bob or senior cha cha??! :)  for the guy unappeased by the happy hour food-what do you expect from free food that is cooked by the load? it's nothing special, i'll agree with that, but for free food, i'm going to go right ahead and say it's amazing. it's FREE for goodness sakes! get over it bro! to complain about FREE food is silly. try BUYING the food--then you get to have an opinion. :P  i'm going back to az in 2 weeks. tucson tho. the macayos there are boring. but u bet ur booty ill be trucking some of the goods home fo sho!"}
{"text":"Another ASU staple. The place is actually a lot of fun, especially with a group of people. The drinks flow in abundance and I had their nachos on my last trip. So good. They had the right amount of cheese and toppings on them. Everything looked so delicious. Dang, now I am getting hungry just thinking about the nachos."}
{"text":"Spacious restaurant with fun décor.  Plenty of servers and fast service.  We had a party of 20 after Aloha Fest down the street.  Reasonable prices and food was good. We ordered taco plates for the kids.  It came with 4 mini taco shells and your choice of protein in a bowl so they could make their own tacos, that was fun. The taco meat had good seasoning.  The free chips were fresh and the spicy salsa had a good kick."}
{"text":"* Shark tacos - I thought the shark meat gave an interesting twist.  The shark meat was slightly on the salty side though.  You'll need to add salsa to give it some taste.  * Brava burrito - Stay away from this creature.  Rice and beans makes a bland burrito.  The beef inside didn't add to the taste at all.  Needs salsa to give it some life.  * Nachos - This is one thing they sort of got right.  Well, it's mighty hard to mess up nachos.  This was probably the best of the 3 items I tried."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my recent visit to this Macayo's. I had not been to a Macayo's in at least three years. I remember it being a much better experience back in those days. First off this restaurant is DIRTY. We were seated inside in one of the upper booths. One of the first things that I noticed was that the tile surrounding the booth was covered in dust. First bad sign. The second thing I noticed was that the stained glass windows beside the booth was covered in sauce splatters, ew. There was also a partial hand print in a white sauce on the side of the tile next to me double ew. Unwrapped my silverware and there was a large chunk of tomato and rice attached to my fork. Don't know how that even happens. Makes me shutter to think what they think is passable in the kitchen if they miss dried food on the utensils.  I should have probably thought twice about eating in an establishment so dirty but against my better judgment I ordered food. The chips and salsa were just okay. The chips did come out warm but the salsa was very watery. We ordered an extra side of hot salsa but our waiter continuously forgot to bring it until we had already eaten half of our meal. It was not really worth waiting for, it tasted like taco bell hot sauce. The service was bad. It started off okay but our waiter was more and more forgetful throughout the meal. I had originally ordered a fireball shot but after about fifteen minutes had gone by and no drink, my fiancé informed one of the other passing waiters that I still had not received my drink. Our waiter showed up in the mean time and asked what it was I had ordered again. He comes back five minutes later and informs me that they are out of fireball. I proceeded to order an extremely over priced $7.99 margarita (usually $8.99). It was decent.  The food. Mediocre at best. I had a Baja chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. My fiancé had a bean burrito enchilada style. The Baja chicken enchilada was pretty good. The Baja sauce has a great flavor but I don't even want to think about how many calories a white cheese cream sauce has in it, it is a once in a few months indulgence but the other food does not make up for the calorie boat of this sauce. The cheese enchilada with red sauce was just meh. The red enchilada sauce tastes generic and too heavy. My fiancé's bean burrito was luke warm inside.   We got the bill and I had been charged for the fireball that they were out of. It was removed ten minutes later. Will not be back here. Way too many other great Mexican options in town."}
{"text":"Holy shit, we just gave this place another chance and man, what a disappointment.   When we arrived 80% of the restaurant was full. We were seated quickly by an efficient hostess.  After 10 minutes we received water.  10 minutes after THAT our server took both drink and food orders.  Then it was another 15 before we received the drinks! Then another 10 goes by and the food comes out, fairly quickly. But they only brought out half the food. So we're all still sitting there, awkwardly, until the final two plates come out.  One of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held. So the entire plate had to be re-made.  A shrimp plate had visible veins left in the shrimp. A chicken taco plate consisted of chicken in a stale flour tortilla - with a side of rice and cabbage. No pico de gallo, no guacamole... basically, nothing to dress the tacos.  Another beer was ordered and didn't show up until we were finished eating.  So what it comes down to is this: Servers need training and the food items need to be re-evaluated."}
{"text":"Macayos had been our go to Mexican restaurant when we visit the Phoenix area.  The Depot Cantina didn't disappoint.  The food and the margaritas were excellent."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but there is better out there. 4th star is for their happy hour which is amazing! 2 dollar XX and free food."}
{"text":"Just a fun Macayo's. Food was good and server was great. Really enjoyed my lunch there."}
{"text":"I grew up in AZ. I remember when it was Woody's! This place as a chain has been on a slow decline for a long time. Like a lot of places, it got a bit more pricey. But hey they have to make money so I get it. Then the plates got a little smaller. Well hey they got to make money I get it. The food got a little less spicey, a little more \"gringo\". I thought well yeah all the people from Ohio who moved here probably complained. But they finally did something that makes me say ENOUGH. We went here today and like always I ask for the hotter sauce right away. The kid brought some. Well that's what he said. He had a blank look on his face and NO PERSONALITY, so I was not sure if he messed up or was just slow or stoned. ANYWAY I kept looking at it. He finally said, \"oh you think I brought the wrong stuff, no they changed the formula a few weeks ago.\" It looked EXACTLY like the regular sauce. He admitted it was not hot at all and he didn't like it either. I can not stand it. If you are going to make the food more bland you CAN NOT make the hot sauce the same. That was the ONLY stuff that made the food better than Taco Bell. So for two of us, with no appetizer and no alcohol it was 45 bucks with tax and tip. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of great, Americanized Mexican food? Do you like a fun environment, cheap margaritas, and large portions? Then Macayos is for you! If you're really serious about your Macayos experience, like me, then you will get the re-usable margarita mugs (Bob and Cha-Cha) so you can return for $4 margaritas anytime! Enjoy a great time, great food, and fun staff at this Arizona dive."}
{"text":"I love Macayo's!!!  We come to Phoenix/Tempe every year for spring training baseball and we always have a meal here.  The place is huge so we have never had a problem getting a table.  We always sit outside because its a great atmosphere and the weather is usually great.    They make excellent margaritas - I have tried some of the flavored ones and regular ones. Their chips, salsa, and guacamole is addicting.  We have had a variety of dishes that have never been disappointing. I especially love their tortilla soup - even when its March and 100 degrees out.  I am already counting down the days until our next visit."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the dinner and live entertainment. Would have been 5 stars if they told me up front they charge each soda, and no refills"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as great as hoped for. The food is OKAY, it did sit a while under the heating lamp as my avocado turned dark and dry... Not smart!, so, freshness got a new meaning here :) It is a bummer that the outside area is right under the take-off path for the Airport and next to a railroad and a railroad crossing (noisy). It was unpleasant to see that nobody came to clean the table and chairs from the thick layer of dessert dust outside.  Overall still worth the visit just some details to take in consideration."}
{"text":"This is a big Happy hour place or at least it was when I was living in the Phoenix/Tempe area in my twenties!  The Green Corn Tamale with their own Baja Sauce.  This is a great dish!  The service was good and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I like coming here during happy hour. You can get really cheap chimis and taquitos. I think they're like 6-7 dollars per dozen. The menu is 1/2 off appetizers. Two dollar dos equis during the same time. The chimis and taquitos are plenty filling and the beer is cheap. Can't beat that.  Only thing is that happy hour is very limited in the time window so make sure you get off work early or maybe head somewhere else. Service always seems like they'd rather be doing something else or they really just aren't all there. More than that, they don't like to try to beat the happy hour times."}
{"text":"C'mon! What's more important in a town where you can find a million Mexican eateries with enough salsa and chips and guacomole to pave your way along the newly installed light rail that runs just outside of this location?  If you answer that a refreshing cerveza or a ginormous top shelf margarita at a reasonable happy hour price allures you...you found a good location for a Monday evening yum yum.    Be assured that the free hor-d'ouvres are not gonna be returned if you plan to walk to some sort of resting place after you slurp away your painful week!  Wait!  Did I say that you arrived on a Monday to sing Karoake because your week just began?"}
{"text":"Meh, is perfect for this actually.  It's mediocre Mexican but not mediocre prices.  Perhaps it's the Tempe location?  I dunno.  I didn't actually have to pay for this meal, but I certainly wouldn't spend my own.  The places itself is rather cute. The restaurant is an old train depot and the patio is large and colorful.    First, the bartender was eating behind the bar. He was CHOWING on his takeout Chinese. He was nice enough, but yeah...  Our servers were prompt and friendly as well. It's just that the food is really not all that great.  I mean, it's fast food Mexican and that's fine; but the prices are too much for the quality.  The appetizers we had were basically as if they were purchased at Costco.  The chicken dish I ordered had a massive amount of hardened cheese and the refried beans and rice were hard.  Meh."}
{"text":"I was at Macayo's Depot Cantina today, Saturday, Oct 19. What a disaster! Was there with the UW alumni club, prior to the ASU game. Not sure I have ever seen a facility so unprepared for a large crowd. It took 45 minutes to get a drink at the bar, and that was lucky. Did not even try for a second round. And food? Forget it. No chance."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what I think of this place. I don't live anywhere near here and try to stay out of Tempe as much as I can. But it's kinda become a ritual to come here before a show at the Marquee.  Mostly because we can hit up happy hour, and get a quick bite and drink many beers before they go up to $10 at the show.  But as big as this place is, it's always dead.  The food isn't anything spectacular but it does the job.  I just like how there seems to always be some kind of drink special and we can get in and get out."}
{"text":"I'm leaving one star because that's the only option.stale chips.worst salsa I have ever had . seriously.waiter had a bad attitude.no personality and stared me down angrily when I asked a question about the food.i ordered the two item combo with an enchilada and a tamale.the side of refried beans was waxy and flavorless.the tamale was hard on the outside and the beef tasted horrible.while we were seated we observed the waiters and waitresses complaining about having to seat a party of 15 with no reservation.which I could understand except the restaurant was empty.all things said,the place seems run down and I won't be making a second visit"}
{"text":"$2 Dos Equis all day everyday....that's my kind of place!  The food is pretty good.  I'm kinda the simple type so 2 tacos, a chimichanga, or taco salad are my go to's.  Their salsa is addicting and I always have plenty of food to take home.  I recommend sitting inside if you want to be in and out.  Only sit outside if you plan on hanging around for a while because the service & refills on drinks are always slow."}
{"text":"They have a great patio for the over twenty one crowd! Full of bars, tables, fountains and crazy dcor this place seems like a great hang out. The only probem is it is quite big which means way overcrowded with sun devils and very noisey. Probably better to try on a off day. The restraunt itself is ok. Came here the other day and ordered the taco salad with beef. I noticed they have one up on most restraunts taco salads because it came with black olives yumm yumm as well as corn. You think that would be a common thing, but it is not.  Good food, but to busy of a location for this senorita"}
{"text":"Ahhh... So many happy memories here, usually involving margaritas. This place has always been great, but it's even extra super cool now that the light rail passes right next to it. It is the old Tempe train depot after all, so it makes sense that trains would still be passing by.   Macayo's is always hoppin', often times with live music on the expansive patio cooled by misters. (There is even a little waterfall.) They're usually pretty great about accommodating large groups. My extended family meets here for all major events like birthdays and holidays.   I'm a creature of habit and stick to the chicken chimis. I most certainly have my ceramic margarita glass that I take with me for a dollar off my drinks too. Mmmmm...Tequila."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner on Saturday night. We were hoping to sit out on the patio, but it was extremely dark and deserted so we opted out. It turns out the patio was closed anyway, which was kind of surprising on a nice Saturday night. We were seated right away and overall the server and service was great. Our server was very attentive and friendly, he definitely made the night.   I ordered the prickly pear margarita and it was absolutely the SWEETEST drink I've ever had, it tasted like I was drinking straight margarita mix. Ugh it was awful and there was barely any alcohol in the drink at all. Very disappointing.   I got the chicken fajitas and my boyfriend had the enchilada sampler. The food came out in literally 10 minutes or maybe even less which was pretty impressive. He enjoyed his meal for the most part but it was definitely nothing to write home about. My chicken fajitas were good but I was very disappointed that it only came with 2 tortillas! Usually fajitas come with at least 3 or even 4 tortillas! I just ended eating the rest of the chicken and vegetables plain. Yeah I could have asked for more tortillas, but at that point I didn't even want to bother. Again food was decent but really nothing special.   AZ has so many great Mexican places but this place can't really hold its own food wise."}
{"text":"Super night at the Depot! Walked in and was immediately greeted by the patio bartender Mike. Awesome guy and super nice so we ordered a drink to hang out for a bit. We asked to be seated in the bar and were sat in a great little private booth. Ben the inside bartender is a Rock Star! He treated us as if we were the only people in the bar! So fantastic and my family really enjoyed themselves. Our food came out and looked amazing and tasted even better! James the Manager came by and was extremely nice and was very attentive to everyone's needs. Awesome experience even with it being a late night dinner."}
{"text":"The Baja pizza appetizer is excellent and the chicken sandwich is huge, we also got chicken enchiladas and street tacos, so good! Free appetizer with proof of Gammage show tickets, on the day of the show. Greg is an awesome waiter. Thanks for everything"}
{"text":"This place is great for events and big groups, within walking distance to ASU, their Margs are some of the best in AZ, food is great, and because of the size you can normally get in without a wait.  Very good place pre and post football games and to watch sports."}
{"text":"Celebrated a co workers Birthday here! It was the perfect place to unwind. Try the Mango Margaritas!"}
{"text":"I've always been one to enjoy Macayo's.  I usually hit up their location on central ave.  This one is definitely made for the college scene; part restaurant, part club (at least it feels like it).  We showed up around 6PM to meet some friends for dinner. Since it' was too crowded we sat on the inside.  I couldn't get enough of their amazing chips n salsa.. I got nuts over that stuff.  After more people decided to show up, we had to move tables.   We had a great waitress who was cool with us moving.  Unfortunately the new waiter we had seemed like he just started that week.  After ordering about six different drinks, I think one came out correct.  It was busy, so we only asked them to replace a couple.  We're not that mean.    So this week I happened to be on a vegetarian kick and I ordered the California Burrito.  Oohhhhh  it was tasty.  However eating literally a basket of chips, I could only eat about half of it.  So wonderful.  So yes I enjoy the food, just wish the services was better when we got moved. Just seemed a bit slow and getting our drinks wrong and one plate, didn't go over too well."}
{"text":"Went for a date with my boyfriend but didn't complain because I preferred to enjoy the company rather than complain about food. I'll say this, one of the stars is for the cool host Issiac and our server was fast. One-ordered a jalapeño margarita, no jalapeño margarita here, had to have a pineapple margarita- which was not good and the jalapeños were cut into what looked like chunks of green bell peppers. Ya, I drank it, I had been craving a margarita all day. The second star was for the tortilla soup the only thing served hot that was edible. My boyfriend ordered a crane asada burrito which was served lukewarm with cold beans and rice that tasted like they'd been sitting around all day. The cheese wasn't even kinda sorta melty inside and the meat tasted dry and old. Literally, it was not even edible. Overall, I felt really disappointed we spent any money on this at all but complaining to the server makes me feel like a jerk, it's not his fault the food sucks. Never again."}
{"text":"Marcos is one of the best servers I've ever had! The service was perfect, he was always going out of his way to help out. And on top of it, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times when visiting family in town.  The ambiance is bright, festive, kitchey and commercialized.  The service is average.  The food is average, run-of-the-mill commercialized Mexican.  I had carne asada grilled tacos.  Meat was very good but everything else was meh.  Food presentation is completely lacking.  We ordered a high-end margarita, which was good to very good.  Nothing stands out here.  Great place to party and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"A-OK In my book. Some friends invited us out for Mexican food in Tempe and this is the place they picked. Not crazy busy on a Saturday night at all, which was nice not having to wait. Our food was good, came out in a reasonable time, service was good.... everything was just good. Nothing bad nothing amazing. If you are in the area and in the mood for some Mexican food, give them a try!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed this joint.   After seeing Inception last night, we were gonna hit up a thai place for dinner, but they were closed so we resorted to Macayo's. The guys at the front were charming (as a \"bouncer\" can be) and we went inside to the restaurant. After standing around awkwardly for a few minutes waiting for someone to notice us...a guy that was busing tables came over and told us to have a seat anywhere.   After a few minutes, we got our menus and placed an order. Service was kind of \"iffy\", as we had a few different guys bring our drinks/app/entrees. The taquitos app was tasty, and when our server brought out my rather naked looking burrito, he asked if I wanted any sauce on it which was nice of him.   Either way, it wasn't an amazing experience, but not one that would stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour on a Thursday we ordered some beers and sat for an hour before anyone took our order. We had a quesadilla ... it was basically a microwaved tortilla with grease and a little cheese some cheap salsa and a couple chunks of chicken... not great! I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Had a very bad start end on a good note.  I took my fiancee and her family here, thinking that a great lunch would be a good way to keep the in-laws-to-be happy on their trip. We sat down around 2pm and were the only people outside what must be an 80-100 person patio.   The DJ for the night was already set up, blasting music to where we couldn't even speak to each other as if we were in Old Town at 2am. I asked him if he could turn it down so we could eat lunch he told me to go fuck myself. Rather than throw a fit I spoke with the General Manager. The music came down shortly therafter and our server Caitlin (caitlyn? always spell that one wrong) took damn good care of us.  Word of advice: if you have a problem tell the GM. I can't remember his name but we owe you for fixing our lunch sir, thank you."}
{"text":"The Macayo's chain is an American version of Mexican food. You won't find anything spicy or authentic on the menu, but the food is still good. Just set the right expectations. They do great lunch specials and a decent happy hour. Two tacos, rice and beans for under 10 bucks. Sure I will.   The service is great and this particular location has a pleasantly large outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, just off mill avenue. Has adequate parking. Menu is what you'd expect, tacos, wings, burgers, chimichangas. . . No good veggie options. Prices are slightly higher than most in this category."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel recommended this hotel for a casual lunch.  We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere and environment.  My wife had a salad and enjoyed it.  My son had shrimp tacos and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I had the fiesta salad with angus steak.  The steak was a little dry, but I dipped it in the Baja sauce which was incredible.  The only factor that was a negative was an unpleasant smell that came through regularly as the wind blew.  Not sure if the garbage was full from a busy weekend (we went on Sunday) or if something nearby was impacting the experience."}
{"text":"The one good thing about this place is it is always consistent, the bad thing is it's always a consistently not good.    The margaritas are so-so, the food is so-so and so is the service - this time we lucked out and got an adequate server.  Most of the staff are poorly dressed and unkempt.  Make sure to order your next cocktail way before your first is finished so you get it in time.    The kicker, the state of the restaurant - it is dirty, unkept and in desperate need of a face-lift or at the very least a fresh coat of paint and pressure washed.  A friend that was with us stated that it's because college kids don't care about the environment that they eat in.  Looking around I pointed out the families and said that if they appealed to the families and the corporate offices in the area, they may have a better environment for guests AND staff.  So why do I keep going back?  It's never my choice.  I only go at the request of other and don't recommend them to anyone.  Have I contacted them about poor device issues?  Yes - management has reached out to me in the past but with each visit, it is clear to me that guest feedback does not effect how they run their business.    The good news, it's America and they can run it however they choose and as long as they are in the black, they aren't going to do anything to change.  Can't argue with that logic I suppose.   I would suggest their Jimaca summer salad though - the dressing is the thing that made it great but I am going to be on the hunt for Jimaca for my salads at home.  I'll just keep going to Fuzzy's for my mexican food and entertain my friends at Cafe Boa."}
{"text":"Ordered steak fajitas and the steak was very tasty, juicy and tender. Wish these restaurant would serve smaller flour tortillas like they do with corn. Waitress was nice and friendly. Small water drought but still good. Complaints were the table was very dirty, especially the food stains on the sides of table. Salsa was a bit lackluster. Chips were good."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual but our waiter was HORRIBLE. If you go there and have Dennis as your waiter you might as well just walk out. We went to a early dinner at 4 to avoid a crowd, and there were maybe 3 other tables but everything took way longer than necessary. Took 20+ minutes to get waters and when we asked for chips and salsa he just seemed annoyed. I asked a question about an enchilada on the menu and his response was \"uhhhhhh, ummmm I guess\". Nobody got refills or anything because Dennis was nowhere to be found. I went to go look for him when my son's dinner never came and I found him in the kitchen area talking with a handful of other waiters.  I like the food but the service is always an issue and is just getting worse. Maybe next time someone wants Mexican we'll have look for a different place."}
{"text":"BEWARE: They over charge!!! We ordered a total of 3 of their $3 margaritas during happy hour and were charged $15.98 ($7.99 x 2)  for 2 of them and $5 for 1. How did we get charged 2 different prices for the exact same margarita? All the guy could tell us was that it wasn't a 10oz pour? Excuse me! We first ordered 2 of the $3 margaritas. Then I had a 2nd one and my husband ordered a beer. They refused to even correct the problem even though it wasn't our fault. We specifically ordered \"2 of the $3 margaritas, please.\"   NOT TO MENTION the fact that we waited over 10 minutes for them to even greet us after being sat at the table. The place wasn't even busy! We sat on the bar side on a Saturday night (Aug. 8, 2015). Only 5 tables were occupied at 7pm. Should have been a warning!  We ordered our food and were tended to by 4 different people that night. Not sure who was our waiter! When I ordered off of the 3-course menu I was told that I could not take off the nasty red sauce in exchange for green. It says on the menu that you can't substitute anything, but it's just sauce that I didn't want. Didn't think that I was breaking any rules by asking for green sauce instead of red sauce. Unbelievable! For the record, I was sick after eating the red sauce and sick to my stomach the next day.   If you want a bad experience, poor service, food that tastes like metal, and to be over charged come to Macayo's Depot Cantina! I'm sure it will be a meal that you never forget!   WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!! Much better places to eat than this place."}
{"text":"I must say that I really liked the Macayo's in Phoenix--I gave that place a good review.  This place though?  The food was good and filling.  I had shredded beef tacos with beans and rice.  The tacos were really dense and good-tasting.  I finished off the meal with sopapillas that were really tasty.  The problem came later.  Both my wife and I began to get gas and emit foul-smelling belches for hours after.  Neither one of us felt very good for the rest of the night.  It wasn't food poisoning, but there was lasting indigestion.  That was not good.    I would say the food is good, but the malaise that I experienced on my flight back to San Francisco would persuade me to steer clear of this place again."}
{"text":"First thing is customer service, usually  makes or breaks my experience sometimes more than the food.  If your wanting a more casual drinking experience, with a great outdoor patio and your not in a hurry to have dinner and drinks then this is your spot!   The food is not great it's your average American \"Mexican\" food.  Just have a margarita and enjoy the patio"}
{"text":"Delicious everythinng.  Best tamales and black bean burritos.  Shark taco is better than expeced.  Margaritas were too sweet though."}
{"text":"Meh, with the abundance of much better Mexican food available we won't be coming back for food.   Food was totally plain Jane and overly greasy.  Our server wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu and forgot about us midway through the meal. We had to flag down a different server to ask for to go containers for the second time and the check.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"Gross food. Bad service. The servers always seem friendly at the beginning and then two hours later when your food hasn't come your realize that you've been had once again by the 'charm' of Macayo's. My friends used to always meet up here my freshman year in college and it always sounded fun but after eating the very low quality food...we all regretted the decision the next morning.   Steer clear!"}
{"text":"Hehe I definitely wouldn't recommend this place if I wanted mexican food but the tex-mex style here is ok.  Basically the average american style Mexican Restaurant with a lot of guac/sour cream/fried with mild flavors executed in an ok way.  If you want real Mexican food though prepare to be disappointed"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Las Vegas, went for dinner @ the Macayo on Ash ave. Great food, good service, clean restaurant. We made a good choice by choosing the restaurant. Anyone looking to eat good Mexican Food, go to Macayo's Depot Cantina on Ash Ave. Next time when I visit Phoenix I will definitely visit Macayo."}
{"text":"Great concept and whimsical decor here at Macayo's, however their quality of food and service makes this place look like the forgotten step sister of chain restaurants like Chili's, Rubio's or Rainforest Cafe.  The place looked completely empty, except for two tables of people and some individuals at the bar. We were served some chips and salsa as well as our waters, which is pretty standard. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler which came with a Verde Chicken, Cheese and Beef Enchiladas, Spanish Rice, Black Beans with Guac, Cabbage and Sour Cream on the side.  My party and I pretty much filled up with chips and salsa before the food came out, it was about more than 25 minutes before all the food came out. As another server brought out my plate, he mentioned something along the lines of \"Do you think you can finish that?\". The sampler is indeed large enough for two people to eat and looked unappealing and messy. The enchiladas were good, but not the best I've ever had. The rice tasted old, with hard pieces and was dry. The beans, gritty and you could see how much bean liquid had evaporated on the side of the plate (possibly from sitting under the hot lamp too long). I managed to eat one of the enchiladas before giving in and just boxing it for to-go.  Service was lacking, don't come here if you're in a hurry! Waiters hardly out front, food is mediocre to say the least and not worth the price you pay. The rest of my party didn't enjoy their Fish Tacos, since the grilled fish was incredibly chewy and over-cooked, they didn't finish their plates."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic chicken nachos. Restaurant is pretty dirty tho. We always go back."}
{"text":"Although it was better than what I expected, it wasn't anything I'm going to go out of my way for. The margaritas were decent and the food was overall pretty good, however, the fried ice cream was a little disappointing for my first try. Overall you can definitely find better mexican cuisine in the valley."}
{"text":"The whole reason I moved to Phoenix was for a job.  Yes, I got a job here in Phoenix and moved here just for that.  California was showing no signs of ever opening up the job market soon so I did what I had to do.  So far, I'm really liking it and finding some cool new places to go and great places to eat.  MacAya's is one of those discoveries.    After spending two weeks with a group of people in a training class, some of us decided to go out and celebrate with lunch on Good Friday, which was a half day for us.  The company was great and I found the place very easily so that was a plus too.  I thought the open patio was awesome and I can see this place hoppin on a Friday or Saturday night.  Even at lunch they had $2 beers!    The service was a little slow, the chips and salsa were ok, and my enchiladas were pretty good, not great, but good.  Honestly, I think it's the atmosphere that got me though.  They had this big outdoor bar and lots of space on the patio, lots of tables and chairs.  I loved the outdoor waterfall too.  So in my opinion, the food is a 2 and I'm giving it another start for the atmosphere.  If you don't expect much when you go, you'll be fine  :)"}
{"text":"I was here for a work event. We reserved a room that was perfect for 25! The guy we had serving our room was great in refilling drinks and food plates. He always was great on timing!! I  As for the food we ordered"}
{"text":"The food is edible, I had the simplest Chicken salad and I didn't even know it was supposed to be minimal. They gave me a chicken salad that consisted of chicken, lettuce and cheese and charged me extra for the pico de gallo, I didn't think that was very cool of them. Honestly, it tasted really good after I put that salsa in there. The absolutely best part of being there was the DJ they had that was playing 90's rock i.e. Nine Inch Nails, Bush, Sublime, 311 etc and some of the new hip music. We were very impressed.   We weren't impressed with the waitress. She was lousy, not very attentive and took so long to get back to us. The place however was huge I did not know I was sitting in a  patio until my friend lit her cig and I finally looked up hah. It was clean and nicely decorated there was a large bar off to the side of the patio and a large fountain. It has a really good vibe to it. We were there early so I could only imagine how it was going to be later on that night.   So besides my waitress being inadequate everything was cool there. I wish I knew the DJ playing though, he was awesome."}
{"text":"If I could rate it 2.5 I would, and in my opinion it's 3 stars, but 2 = \"Meh\" on yelp.  The food here is average, a little quick and sloppy, especially at night with the college frat boy kid rush. The security / ID checkers are pretty nice, the waitresses and hostess are pretty air headed, I've been here around 5 times, same experience each time. For example, I asked \"Did you see me come in here with ___?\" Both girls at the front stared at me blankly, \"Umm... I dunno, I don't really pay attention, ha sorry.\" Then they went back to talking to each other before I could respond.   Macayo's always has pretty cool events though, but those are separate producers of course, they never have enough events at the back area events either... staff is also pretty rude to me, and I'm always event staff, ignoring me and complaining when I said the main staff didn't get any food.  This place is good for people looking to scarf down some quick faux Mexican food, preferably a young person, college crowd, \"bro\", \"frat\", idk I assume someone that likes fart jokes. I does not appear to be good for children or families to me... not good for dancing. Get's 21+ around....7pm I think. Awhile ago I went with some older friends around 9, there was literally no one there, odd night, and 1 security guard with the kitchen still open. My friends went inside and used the rest room, got a couple drinks and I stood outside shouting to them by the ledge. Then we left."}
{"text":"You don't really go to Macayos for great Mexican food; there are far too many superior hole-in-the-wall places for that in Phoenix/Tempe. But this place has a great happy hour on Fridays. I spent many a Friday afternoon getting here early and drinking late. They put on a decent spread as far as the grub goes, but let's face it: this place is about drinking. And the atmosphere lends itself to that, so drink up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"**this review written by my wife**  I went here today for lunch with my sister and four kids. We got there around 12:50pm and walked up go the hostess stand. We waited there for about 6 or 7 minutes before someome acknowledged us. While we were waiting at least 6 employees walked by and not a single one asked if we had been helped, or offered to seat us. When someone finally came they told us it would be a 20 minute wait for inside the restaurant and a 10 minute wait for the patio. I looked on the patio and there were at least 10 tables open.   Once we were seated we quickly ordered our food. My husband wasn't with us but asked if i would order him food to go. He told me what he wanted which I then looked over at the menu to find. I couldn't find it anywhere on the menu so i asked the server. The waitress then told me what my husband wanted was on the lunch menu which we originally didn't get!  I couldnt believe that a lunch menu is offered daily from 12-3 and they didn't give us one!  The food was good but the service wasn't.  I would have ordered something from the lunch menu had it been provided in time. Instead, I ordered something comparatively more expensive. I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"xcellent service. Decided to check this place out after running the Rock n Roll Arizona Half Marathon because they were offering a discount to runners and I saw that they had a separate vegetarian menu which would please both myself (a vegan) and the meat eaters in my group. Once I let the server know that I was vegan, he went above and beyond to make sure that the cook ensured my vegetarian enchiladas were made vegan. They are stars for special needs diets as I noticed they also offer a gluten free menu for those that may need it."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat inconsistent in its ability to provide good service and in some instances the food was not as good as it was in others.  Overall I still like this place but am not always easily persuaded to visit. The baja california chimi is my favorite thing on the menu.  On Fridays they have an all you can eat free buffet. As a poor college student I have spent a number of Fridays eating their food. They have stuff like spaghetti and mini burritos and rice. All of the free food is doused in hot spices and sauces to keep everyone eating a minimum but that never phased me."}
{"text":"Although I'm generally not a fan of Mexican food, I love this place.  I don't like the beans served in Mexican restaurants and the waitstaff is very good at helping me order things without beans...  chimichanga or fajitas.  I like the decor and that it's convenient to work."}
{"text":"Good service good food. Nothing overly special. I enjoyed the ceviche but the quesadilla was meh. So, will I go back? Can't say for sure. I'm sure there are better restaurant I would try before I head back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Typical Mexican food. Nice atmosphere outdoor patio with fireplace very nice"}
{"text":"Had a decent lunch here the other day with my co-workers.  We go here often for happy hour after work.  The food was pretty decent.  The lunch menu is oddly full of mostly non-mexican style food.  That was odd.  Service was ok until it got a little busy.  Then my cup was more half empty than half full."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of American Mexican food so I frequent this place often when I am in the Tempe area and since I like Tempe Town Lake I am there often.  This place has an awesome outdoor patio bar and seating area and is convienently located next to a light rail stop. The inside decor is fabulous and the piece de resistance is the chandelier made from Corona bottles.  The menu is comprised of your traditional mexican dishes like tacos, chimichangas, burritos and so much more. I have tried numerous items from the menu but sadly have not found anything that wows me so much that I want to eat it every time I go.  I advise to ask for the spicy salsa when they bring you your chips and salsa.   The downside to this restaurant is that the service is never consistent. More times than not I get seated in a location that everyone forgets about and so it takes forever to be waited on.  Often times when I request a special order of no tomatoes, since I really don't like them in most of my food, I still get them served with my meal anyway.  Despite these inconveniences I still return."}
{"text":"Screw all of the \"it is not real mexican food\" people. This place is tasty. Great salsa! Anything on the menu that has Baja sauce on it is sure to be great. Chicken Poblano is great as well (there is even a little baja sauce in this dish). Don't listen to the haters, Macayo is the bomb!"}
{"text":"My review is based upon our experience on having a large private party in the Caboose Party Area - it was AWESOME!  We were looking for a fun/casual/not JUST a bar but had a bar kind of place for our 20 year reunion.  The Caboose Party Area was PERFECT!  It has  a private entrance and enough space for a DJ, dancing, photo booth, tables, mingling and space to break off into more intimate groups - either outside or just inside the indoor bar area.  The food provided was yummy and the drinks were priced right & good!  The service we received was stellar - from the beginning to the end.  I had several people come up to me telling me what a GREAT place this was and how much more fun this was than their reunion or that they were going to suggest this as a location for an upcoming reunion.  We also used The Courtyard by Marriot Downtown Tempe as our hotel base - so people could do the drunk walk home.  ;)  My only wish was that Macayo's stayed open after midnight.  The party had to roll over to Mill. :)  Oh!  On a side note - Their blackened Ahi Tacos are KILLER!"}
{"text":"Had some apps & drinks here a couple nights ago. They have a really nice patio & it's a pretty nice location.  I'm all about food though.  We had mini chimis, beef taquitos & spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy. Seemed like the mini chimis & taquitos likely came frozen in a huge bag - have enjoyed ones we've gotten in the frozen section of the supermarket more. The spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too. Tasted predominately of cream/sour cream without much flavor.   Would go back for a social thing but if we ordered food here, definitely would try something different."}
{"text":"Thank you Cam for making my birthday special. We will definitely be back! Our experience here was fantastic great good fast service! I would highly recommend coming here especially with a big group!(:"}
{"text":"Wow. Yeah this place sucked. And this is just the ;tldr version. I came here with a friend for drinks after work, I was amazed at how beautiful the place was and was totally ready to bring some of my other friends here for our next hang outs. The two of us were seated outside with 2 other small groups and we waited for our waitress to come by and take our order or even introduce herself. Instead, she only served the table next to us and blatantly ignored us the whole time. We counted about 15 minutes and realized she wasn't even going to acknowledge our presence, even after raising a hand or smiling her way she pointedly ignored us. So we got up and decided to go ask about bar seating figuring we might be able to get our drinks faster that way. We asked the same waitress who was supposed to be our server about sitting at the bar and she told us to go ask the hostess who was not there even after we stood there for a few moments. After asking blonde ponytail about bar seating and getting her cold and clipped reply she simply walked away to attend to other business. I'm appalled that we were treated this way, like we were trash or something. I tried to be as patient and polite as possible...but why should I have to? I'm giving MACAYOS money...not the other way around. Needless to say, I will NEVER spend another dollar at this place and would never recommend it to anyone either. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Dining experience started off really bad! Unfriendly staff, long wait times and staff seemed confused on what they were supposed to do. About half way through the meal the staff got more friendly and we had a better dining experience. Atmosphere and decor are great. Food was pretty good. We got nachos with beef, guacamole, and baja sauce. Baja sauce is great! Also got a Mexican pizza which was good. Nachos seemed a little skimpy on toppings but wee pretty good. Overall decent experience but they could use work in service."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! We ate here with a recommendation from a local! Fabulous atmosphere and decor is unique. Chips and salsa are on point! I had a Mexican pizza! Food came out fast and the service was friendly and accommodating (table of five during lunch)!  Neat area of town!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Friday night before seeing my friend put on a concert. I usually go to the one on Central Ave in Phoenix, but the concert was in Tempe so this is where I ended up going. The only difference between here and the one in Phoenix is the fact they have combos instead of the Mex and Match. The combos come with rice and beans and are $11 or $12 can't remember which. The guy substituted the rice and beans for the tortilla soup but I guess it is up to the guy running it if they do that or not. The quality of the food was amazing. I got my usual chile relleno and green corn tamale with baja sauce. Basically I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty.  Chile Relleno made with a large, crisp mild pepper with tons of cheese.  Green pork burrito had tender meat and great green chile sauce.  Sour cream chicken enchilada had lean, moist meat.  All was served on a piping hot plate that kept the food warm the entire meal (try duplicating that at a \"food\" truck).  Service was quick and appropriate, and all in a historic train depot.  Got out for under $20."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times now and most likely coming for our fifth here soon. The reason? I love the atmosphere for the dining room and outside. I also love, love, love their food. I am a very picky eater, but their chicken tacos are delicious. There's two reasons I am not giving it a full 5 stars (which I am sad about, because their food really is amazing).   1. When entering the building, we always seem to wait for a period of time before someone greets us and finds us a table. Which overall is fine, I don't mind waiting a bit.   2. Our last visit our server seemed irritated by our table, which was sad because it was my parents first time there. I understand though. My husband and I have worked in restaurants before and people have bad days. Also, not every server is the same. BUT that did not stop us from enjoying the yummy food.   We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I CANNOT believe I haven't reviewed this place! I wasn't going to review this place for my experience last night (which was pretty par) because I assumed I had reviewed before, but apparently not. Anyway, Macayo's as a whole is somewhat a blight on society. I know that is a little strong, but it really is not good and not authentic and just not a place where people should eat ever if they have the option. I have been to this location several times (always against my will....I have a friend that really likes it...not sure how that is possible and went to grad school at ASU, so hard to avoid). Anyway, the few times I have had dishes with meat in them from this restaurant are by far the worst times. Their meat is horrible. It has a disgusting texture and is completely devoid of flavor. So meat is definitely out when eating here (that is probably safer for your health anyway....I am just imagining a Kitchen Nightmares type scenario behind the scenes at this place). The food that does not contain meat is significantly less disgusting, albeit pretty bland. Their one saving grace is their baja sauce (sweet cream cheesy sauce) which is obviously tasty, but so terrible for you it is hard to eat in good conscious (but sometimes.....let's just say it happens). So last night I got a cheese crisp, which is pretty unmessupable and it was fine, although it had several random food items on it that obviously fell onto it from other plates (some lettuce, a small piece of chicken, etc)....nice touch. I had their 'special' Marg which was actually pretty good (it was Grand Marnier and tequila), but when I got the bill it was still 9$, so it did not appear to actually be on special (or it is an incredibly overpriced drink to begin with). That brings me to another complaint....this place is WAY overpriced. Like, an entree costs 12$ at least and is lower quality than Filiberto's. The entrees are also way WAY too big....they should probably offer half or quarter size portions for less (although the food isn't good anyway, so it doesn't really matter). So why 2 stars and not 1? This place is a decent place to drink if you are into premixed type alcohol, but they have a good happy hour and the baja sauce is good, so I can't justify a 1 star BUT if I had it my way, I would never eat at a Macayo's again ever."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, bit I'll come back. Why? Depot Cantina gave us A+  service for our graduation party!!!  PROS: a portion of outside patio area was cordoned off just for us; ASU colors; appetizers delivered on cue and they were hot, fresh and tasty; Trevor did a great job to ensure our 25 friends and family were taken care of--no one was w/out a drink all nite!  CONS: nothing to report  Thanks to Staci Braza and Trevor for making our grad party a lot of fun!   Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour with 5 employees.  The drink special are okay, but they don't have the variety that I'm used to....The food is hit and miss, mostly unexciting but edible without feeling the need to complain.  The wait staff is polite and friendly, but you can tell that they know the food is borderline between boring and sucky. My advice?  The patio in the evening is pretty, and you can relax and enjoy a fairly decent margarita without breaking the bank.  I'm not sure it's worth going for happy hour though since  during the day it's kind of boring. All in all, an okay experience that I wouldn't mind repeating, but I might eat before I go.  Maybe."}
{"text":"I love this place! We went there for several dinner parties. The last one we had about 10 extra people show up and they accommodated without skipping a beat! Get service and great place."}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant for quality Mexican food in Tempe, Arizona.  Prices are reasonable happy hours specials are beyond great. Happy hour specials are all day Saturday  and Sunday. Food is great --- atmosphere fun and well decorated. You feel like you are in Cabo. Staff is great and management is excellent. Definitely worth coming to. We are from Southern  California and came here twice during our quick visit to Tempe."}
{"text":"$4.50 for a corona?! C'mon! That is ridiculous. For just $2 more I can buy 6 of them. Also, their margaritas aren't anything special. I ordered a chambord margarita with patron tequila and it was just meh. It was really sweet and they use that pre-made margarita mix. If you're going to charge $9 for a margarita at least use the quality margarita mix or make your own."}
{"text":"Probably the slowest service I have ever had. Our table of 7 waited about 45 min just for our drinks, and 30 min for him to bring our check. With only 2 or 3 other tables filled in the restaurant, you'd think the service would be prompt.  The food was very disappointing as well. I think this place must have been established in the Midwest. Everything about it was very bland: salsa, food, don't get me started on the margaritas. No where close to authentic."}
{"text":"Came here before an ASU football game and it was packed. The service was poor (slow, order came out wrong). Not sure if it was because of the volume of people or not, but management should staff more employees in anticipation of this on game days.  The food is nothing special and the prices average. The only positive aspec tis the atmosphere. It is partially outdoors and brightly decoratedon the inside."}
{"text":"Very good as always. I've never been disappointed at Macayo's. Food is always consistent"}
{"text":"Best frozen margarita and under $6, please and thank you! We just stopped in for the drinks after a long day riding the light rail, walking around downtown, climbing A mountain, and renting peddle boats on tempe town lake. These drinks were a treat for the day we had out in the sun. I'll have to try the food next time!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight to celebrate my Aunt's birthday, she had never been before and wanted to try it out. She liked the festive atmosphere of the restaurant. I had not been in years, and was happy they still served the baja chimi I liked- with the spicy cream cheese. SO not a healthy choice, but worth it because you get plenty of food and you have lunch the next day. ;-) The service started out ok.  Then the dinner rush hit and our service slowed down. They also brought out 3 of our 7 meals, then 5 minutes later brought out the rest. Thought that was weird. All-in-all it's a decent place to go once in awhile, but not to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Macayo's.  The open layout was festively decorated and had a fun vibe.  It has a great location near the light rail stop.  Unfortunately the food and drink didn't measure up.  I sampled the spinach con queso, sour cream chicken enchiladas, cheese enchiladas, fajita quesadilla and beef taquitos.  Generally, the food was heavy and dull, with little in the way of interesting spices or flavors to liven it up.  Macayo's take on the quesadilla will disappoint cheese lovers, as it is mostly filled with meat and peppers.  I made the mistake of ordering the \"special\" blue margarita, which had a splash of blue curacao.  The server assured me it would taste just like a regular margarita, but it was dreadful - the cloying sweetness completely smothered the lime tartness I was craving.    If  you go, enjoy the fun interior but don't expect a breakout Mexican food experience."}
{"text":"When we hadn't made any other plans for Cinco de Mayo, and we didn't feel like putting in much creativity - yet wanted to keep up the \"eat Mexican food on May 5th tradition\" we would occasionally end up here.  Not that it was near where we lived, as all of us were in North Phoenix, but it was because we wanted it to be \"special\" than the other normal times we ate at the same Mexican food restaurants.    I think that is the highlight of this location.  It's a little different than other locations.  They have great happy hour specials.  Things get insane on Cinco de Mayo (at least 2 years we just ate at the bar because we couldn't even get a table).  It's Macayos level food, and a slightly more interesting physical location.  There are usually a few attractive college folks either working there or dining - and that can at least add to the overall atmosphere.  That said, occasionally large groups of said college folks can have the opposite effect.  You have to take your chances."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place in the in the valley but the menu cuts and patio not kept up they are losing a life long customer. It's really sad! The menu cuts with combos killed me!!! The salsa also changed. I'm not coming back!!!!!  It's NOT right!"}
{"text":"College town Mexican Restaurant/bar with large outdoor seating.  Food was above average and service was excellent.  I ordered off the Chef experimental menu and had an excellent tostada with cabbage/jalapeño and tingo chicken."}
{"text":"I really like this Macayo's. The ambience is awesome as is the decor.  You definitely feel like you are at a Mexican Restaurant.  I usually get the cheese crisp and my husband typical will get the steak fajitas.  Both are always really good and we generally don't have food complaints, service is good, and food is hot.    This location is right next to the light rail so we sometimes park here and eat and then hop on the light rail to a Dbacks game.  Makes us feel a bit more metropolitan ....lol.   The prices are decent, the atmosphere is fun and the food and service are good.  I think its a great place to go if you have company in town, and then walk around the ASU shops in Tempe...makes for a fun and relaxing evening."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, came out not. Busser  refilled chips and drinks frequently and the overall feel and decorations of the place were great. The service we received though was less than satisfactory. It honestly felt like she simply wasn't listening. She filled our drink order incorrectly, instead of simply apologizing she made an excuse that I wasn't clear on the order... Not sure how much more clear I can say lemonade. My side of sour cream was missing from the order, as well the bus boy ended up correcting it. Overall- not super impressed with the service. Waiting 15 minutes to receive boxes seems a tad excessive.  But the food was good, willing to go again if we got a different server."}
{"text":"Met some people here for dinner recently and I did not pick the place. I usually don't do Mexican chains and unless you're a college student, this place really isn't for you. But as I said, I was meeting several people who picked this place.   I took a recommendation from my waiter (who was actually pretty cool) and ended up with some Pablano Steak meal that was just ok. It was too much like fajita without the yumminess. This was just so average and reminds me why I do not go to Macayo's much."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was cold by the time it arrive to our table. The chips was stale, had to be sent back. Our waitress did not have much knowledge of the food. Not sure what happen today, the service and quality of food have been excellent last time. Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"So, I walked in the door and followed the instructions on the sign to wait there for seating. After a couple of minutes, a guy in a gruff voice says, \"Can I help you with something?\" To which I replied, I'd like a seat. He said, just go sit anywhere. I probably should have taken that as a cue to leave right then, as it only got worse from there. I ordered one of the specialties. The same one that I usually order at the central Phoenix location. The food quality was terrible. The beans looked crusty and the rice was cold and very dry. The meat was tough, and tell me please they didn't get the cheese out of a can--it sure tasted like it. At least the beer was cold. They got a star for that and a star for the waiter being decent."}
{"text":"We had never been before.  Was highly recommended by the girl working the front desk at our hotel.  Very happy we went.  Food was amazing!!!  I got steak fajitas and they were awesome.  Customer service was good.  Our waitress was being trained but she did a great job.   Highly recommend if you find yourself in town."}
