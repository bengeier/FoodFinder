{"text":"Come for the Thursday trivia, stay for the bar fights. Reasonably priced rotating Great Lakes tap is also a plus."}
{"text":"Decent place to hang out. VERY chill atmosphere. I like playing the computer games offered in the middle of the bar.  Their wings is what make the place, in my opinion. The jumbo wings come with the drum & wing attached. So for the money, a half dozen is really a dozen \"wing dings\". Their buffalo garlic parm sauce is on point, and you can't go wrong with it.  The sweet potato fries are plain though the fries are okay.  The Italian sandwich was big. I liked putting the Italian dressing offered all over the sandwich or dipping it.  Fair prices on drinks."}
{"text":"Ryan's has the look and feel of the neighborhood bar we all long for, that TV has told us we can have. A place where everyone knows your name and just might feature heavily when you one day tell your kids how you met their mother. Unfortunately, it falls a little below those standards. But it isn't bad.   Moving into the neighborhood I was excited to have an Irish Pub nearby. My strong British roots give me a love for Guinness, stew, corned beef and cabbage. I envisioned a place with good cheap beer where my friends and I could spend many a night, but the place just doesn't draw me back to it.   The beers are overpriced for the atmosphere (and the selection) and the food is nothing great. Their kitchen is open later than most, and the food certainly isn't bad, so if you want something fried up at midnight, I'd actually recommend it. Along with some Lipitor. But for the drink prices, you might as well go down the street to D's where the selection is 100-fold and the food is more original.   The bar is large, and that is nice. I always seem to be able to get a stool if we want them, and there is a dartboard in the back (thought it's a little awkwardly placed near the restroom).   They also do a pretty good trivia night. That is worth checking out if you and your friends have a ton of useless knowledge like I do.   They have an outdoor smoking section in the summer and has closed windows in the cooler months.   TVs are ok, but not very big at the bar. In the seating area there is a big old-school rear-projection TV (the kind that was a \"big-screen\" in 1990) and they will play games on that. No HD on that one though.  So, decent food that isn't anything special and beer that is a little pricer than it needs to be are the reasons I won't give this a 4-star rating. But it's not a bad little place in the end."}
{"text":"Some food is good some isn't. Veggie burgers and milkshakes are great.  Salads and pretzels aren't. Trivia on Thursdays brings in the crowd and is a good time."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Ryan's Pub a lot. Like A LOT. My most recent trip was I guess as expected.  I ordered wings and a side salad. Fairly priced. Wings were okay. They could have been dropped for a little longer in the fryer. Salad was eh. Sub par lettuce.  Friend ordered a dish with mashed potatoes and they were cold. Had to be sent back to reheat.  Our server was frazzled. I don't think it had to do with the number of tables he had. I think he is probably by nature a frazzled person. Had to come back twice to ask our order that he wrote down initially and we had to flag him for reheat.  Will I go back? Eh. Not sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now, awesome bartenders and a pretty decent food... Overall it's a chill bar.."}
{"text":"IDK kind of in between a two and three, but their close proximity to the last yelp event we attended and my brothers apartment I am going to have to say a three.    A couple of things.  They don't offer much in the draft selection, however I felt their beers were priced better than most places including their craft beers.    The place is a dive, total gut job, but if I lived close by I could see coming here for drinks now and again.  They definitely seemed to attract the locals.    Also, it's really dirty.  I mean kind of disgusting in some ways.  All the menus were sticky as was the floor and some of the tables.  My little brother raved about their food but it really isn't my style of eating so that coupled with the unsanitary conditions of the bar, menu, tables, and floors I would probably not try anything from the kitchen.  If the front of the house is this nasty what's going on behind closed doors?  I only hope I am wrong.  Lastly the TV's are all sharing the same HDMI cables so none of them really look clear even though they have a nice amount of TV's on the walls."}
{"text":"First time in here, and it's weird.  I mean where do you go that has a bar with changing closing times?  A sign above the bar basically says something along the lines that 'Ryan's will close tonight at' and they have things to hang below it that look something similar to what they use to teach children how to tell time in elementary school.  Asides form that confusion, I really wasn't digging the vibe here.  The color was a bit offsetting to me.  Could have been because it was almost all green and it reminded me of being in a hospital from yesteryear.  Smoking is only allowed on the small outdoor patio area...if the windows are open.  Make up your mind, allow smoking, or don't.  It's that simple, your customers who do smoke will respect your decision.  Prices weren't bad, and I do admit it's a decent enough place to stop on the way home to get a nightcap (If it's open that late)."}
{"text":"Ryan's Pub is a Regent Square neighborhood bar with a following.  It is a bit of a dive bar with a reasonable beer selection, but not comparable to other bars in the area.  It has some palatable menu selections, i.e. the wings are very good, but there are very few health conscious items on the menu. They have a dartboard and trivia night which are reasonable attractions.  TV's are good for a game but are not large screen.  I had visited the bar years ago and remember it being better.  Not too many updates since then."}
{"text":"Ryan's is a go to of mine because I live so very close. If you're looking for a quaint and pleasant pub to go to, this is not the one you're looking for. But, if you want a good selection of beers, specialty drinks, and actually really good food and you're in the area - come on in!   Ryan's is very welcoming, the don't rush you if you just are just having a few drinks and watching a game or hanging with friends which is another reason why I enjoy Ryan's, there is zero pressure to spend more, eat more, when all you want is to drink, maybe eat, and spend some time socializing.   Ryan's has outdoor seating and a pretty spacious sitting area inside as well. Don't try and eat at the bar unless you're willing to risk spilling food on your lap, as the distance between you and where your plate is on the bar is very far. Also, don't expect great quality in the TVs, they could use a signal upgrade."}
{"text":"One of the only places I know where to get full wings.  These wings are sublter - not as saucy.  But they are crisp.  Get the buffalo butter garlic.  It's a thinner, buttery sauce, but still oh-so-good."}
{"text":"Nice little Irish Pub! If only their beer selection was larger!"}
{"text":"Horrible place.  This bar/restaurant could be so much more, but the surly employees and their laissez-faire (for you Ryan's employees reading this, that means 'I couldn't give a damn') attitude just seals the deal:  I'll never set foot in this place again.  Add to their attitude, and the mediocre food, the fact that their \"patio,\" where all the windows were closed tonight, was filthy with smoke.  When I questioned the self-designated queen behind the bar about this, she asked why I was \"so angry.\"  Well, that comment practically lead my mouse to the Allegheny County Smoking Violation Report website, needless to say.  It's a shame that a place such as this still exists; clearly it draws from beyond the actual Regent Square neighborhood, where tastes are obviously not so discriminating."}
{"text":"My go-to neighborhood spot when I am craving a Guinness and have work to do-- they have free wi-fi. Everyone is always super nice to me here and the fries are pretty good. While I am not a sports fan, they have big TV's which I imagine would be great for game watchin'. I usually come here in the afternoons, so it never gets too crowded. It's a comfy, down to earth, no frills place to hang and enjoy an adult beverage. Wood paneling and green vinyl booths. I hear the trivia night is pretty cool; I'm hoping to check that out soon. As a nonsmoker, I just wish the the outdoor patio wasn't a \"smoking patio\" because it has a really nice view of Frick Park."}
{"text":"My Husband and I have lived four blocks from Ryans for a year and a half.  We always talked about visiting but were never sure what it would be like and would opt for Dee's or the Map Room.  One day we finally gave in and it was totally worth it.  Ryan's has a huge bar so when we went on a Saturday night it was not crowded at all.  The food was good and they had a (somewhat) decent beer selection.  It is a great neighborhood bar if you want to go out but are looking for more of a chill hangout."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends on a Thursday night, because we heard about Thursday night team trivia here.  It turns out that Thursday trivia only take place when there isn't a game on, and we had forgotten that the Pens were playing that night.  Since we were already there, however, we decided to stay for drinks and some food.  Best feature at Ryan's: the enclosed patio area.  Since Frick Park is right across the street, the view from the patio ain't too shabby either.  The indoor seating area's also a pretty good size.  The menu is more extensive than I expected: sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and more unusual items such as pierogies and jumbo breaded shrimp.  This is a totally unpretentious place: the soup of the day was, I believe, hamburger noodle.  I was a little bummed by my nachos though--processed cheese instead of real cheese, and the soggy/crunchy chip ratio leaned more towards the soggy than I would have liked.  The extra salsa I requested turned out to be just a few flecks of tomato.  The onion rings, however, are generously battered, and while I didn't sample it, my friend's reuben looked delicious.  Beer selection was decent, but wasn't cheap.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating to our party which kept on expanding.  We did have a hard time locating her as the night got later even though the number of customers in the bar was dwindling.    While it doesn't have the best beer or food quality and prices, Ryan's is a down-to-earth place that's good for meeting a group of friends.  In addition to Thursday trivia, I've heard that there's karaoke on another night of the week."}
{"text":"We have driven past Ryan's Pub on many occasions always wondering what it was like to visit here. We finally got the chance on a weekday during a pens playoff game.   We had already eaten so we were just coming here for drinks and to watch the game.  My brother in law lives just down the street and he had been here before so he suggested that we should stop by.         It's a bigger restaurant than what I was thinking from driving past.  It has a very long bar but since there were four of us we decided to get a table.  This place isn't the newest of bar/restaurants and it seems a little dumpy but we still had a good time.  They have some good food menu items if you're into bar food.  They have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap.      The tables and menus were kind of sticky and I hate that.  I liked the size and the number of TV's in there but they were blurry.  It really looked like they were sharing the cable wire on each TV.  Those televisions should have been a lot sharper than they were.         I think my wife and I would come back here for a few drinks but if a big game was on we would probably go somewhere else to watch it because of the blurry TV's."}
{"text":"I used to live half a block from Ryan's and enjoyed popping in with friends and meeting up with neighborhood pals. They always have great drink specials like the Bruce Wayne and Green Lantern. Often would order dinner for take away too. Great salads."}
