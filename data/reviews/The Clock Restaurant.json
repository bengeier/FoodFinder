{"text":"Good enough place to get comfort food. Nothing special but gets the job done."}
{"text":"The Clock is another one of those places that's OK, but not fantastic.  They have good food at pretty cheap prices.  The dining room itself was very clean and well stocked.  One good thing about it was the variety of people the lunch crowd brought in.  I saw everyone from laborers to businessmen, so they must be doing something right to draw such a diverse group.  They have a drive through window if you're in a hurry, and really cheap lunch specials."}
{"text":"The Clock is one of those old-Charlotte Greek family owned places that has been around Charlotte for a long time.  This is not their original location, but I don't think it is too far from where they were at first.  It is located by the little strip shopping center on the corner of South Blvd & Tyvola road and can be easy to miss the first time you go.   If you have eaten at the BBQ King on Wilkinson and liked their food, you'll like this place... the food is about the same but it is a sit-down restaurant housed in a former fast-food joint.   On the menu, you will find BBQ (minced or sliced), French Fries, Onion Rings, Burgers, Fried Chicken, Fried Fish, Hamburger Steak, Coleslaw and that sort of thing.   They do have the take-out window in operation, but I think that is only for call-ahead orders.   When I am in the mood for a good onion ring but don't have time to go all the way to BBQ King on Wilkinson, this is the place to go.   Prices are cheap, but just about everything here is fried, so if you're trying to eat healthier fare, you might want to think twice before you stop in.   Their sweet tea is pretty sweet - if you are a native from NC, SC, or GA, you might like it. Otherwise, you might find it a tad too sweet."}
{"text":"We had lunch here a week or so ago and the food was so-so.  It's one of those meat and vegetable places.  We were there at 11:30 & were the only patrons in the place.   The service was good & it appeared to be clean. A co-worker went a couple days later & it was closed, she went back the next day & it was still closed.  We were later told that it was closed because everyone had the  flu. M-m-m-m makes me wonder."}
