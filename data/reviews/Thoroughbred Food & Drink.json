{"text":"Awesome spot, hidden away on Richmond Street (near Peter), directly opposite Scotiabank cinemas. Great brews, really, really nice food. Not the same old, same old. We ordered Waldorf Salad (w Quinoa) Wild Mushroom Tart, Steak Frites w wedge fries. Wanted to try the loaded potatoes, the fish of the day, and the interesting sounding hot dog. Will definitely be going back. Staff was friendly and service was flawless."}
{"text":"Love this place! They offer sommelier classes on their upper levels so their wine selection is on point.    Their cheese platter is unique compared to the boring quite generic flavours and selection that you find around town.  Being an avid lover of cheese I give this...Two thumbs up!   Their jerk octopus is tasty and well cooked.  The cauliflower is slightly on the salty side but still worth ordering.  Lastly their tartare is mmm mm exquisite!   Top this off with informative and friendly staff... you are looking for a good night/meal out!   :) ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"best kung po cauliflower ever! staff service from jacob greeting you, jim at the bar, willian waiting us..i will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Friday. Food was fantastic. Dishes were presented elegantly. Servers were attentive to our small group and made our first experience much more enjoyable. Also, loved the funky decor of this new restaurant. Can't wait to go back to try more of their food -- dinner next time."}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW See blog  Bay Oysters ($3.50 each) Mignonette & Horseradish  [11]  Meaty briny oysters balanced out by a perfectly sharp mignonette and a zippy horseradish.   Chicken Liver Mousse ($10) Pickled Sultanas, Granola, Marbled Rye  [12]  A lot of you may think you don't like liver, but a lot of you would be sorely wrong if you tasted this dish. The whipped mousse enveloped my tongue with its silky consistency that was in perfect contrast with the crunchy torn rye, the chewy dried fruit and the supple pops of granola across the plate. While chicken liver is notoriously unctuous and rich, Ariel's pickled raisins and sprightly acidic sauce helped cut the fat. This tasted even better than it looked.   Roast Broccoli Marrow ($6) Broccoli Carpaccio, Plum Vinegar, Mache   [14]  A lot of people think the only thing you can do with broccoli is to steam it a la diet food, or mix it with mayo in some kind of Paula Deen inspired recipe. Ariel proves them wrong. Here, the hearty stocks were caramelized to bring out their sweetness, and then showered with little bits of the textured crowns, crunchy nuts, and a brightly acidic plum vinegar. This was the dish that made me instantly say in my head I'm so excited to come back here again because the flavours were so bold, so fresh, so addictive I just wanted more. I wanted more broccoli- how many places can make you think that?  Kung Pao Cauliflower ($9) Cashews, Cilantro, Chili  [15]  I'm so happy that cauliflower came back for its well-deserved comeback because when you deep-fry it and toss it in a spicy sweet sauce with fragrant cilantro and crunchy nuts, it simply just tastes-so-freaking-good. Cauliflower haters, eat this- it may change your perspective on life.  Duck Confit Nachos ($9) Salsa Roja, Tomatillo, Queso Fresco  [16]  The moment I saw \"duck confit\" and \"nachos\" together on one line in the menu, I assumed they put them on there just for me. Nachos are my game folks, and duck confit is my reason for living. Now, this is not your bar standard nacho platter, folks. This-is-perfection. Gorgeously crispy chips loaded with tender, sweet duck meat that was nicely balanced by the acidity of the sliced tomatillo, the spicy chili and the salty cheese. I want to eat these every day. Please. Thank you. Please.  Sunchoke Bravas ($7) Smoked Yogurt, Pepita, Sumac  [17]  Having just returned back from Spain, it was fun to see this (dare-I-use-the-F-word) fusion of a classic Spanish bar food with Middle Eastern flavours. Unlike the traditional potatoes in the dish, the sunchokes provided a rich sweet nutty flavour that was brought out roasted red peppers, the tangy smoky yogurt and the citrusy sumac. Top all that goodness off with a shower of crispy sunchoke chips, and just try not fighting over this dish.  Banana Split ($9) Brownies, Burnt Butter Ice Cream, Bruleed Banana, Caramel  [18]  Definitely not the banana split you may be expecting, but I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Dark, rich, fudgy brownies paired with lusciously smooth and rich brown butter ice cream. Oh brown butter, you get me every time. The star, however, was the bruleed banana half that was laid spread eagle across the plate, offering its characteristic bitter-sweet candy shell and delicate fruit beneath.   Chocolate Bar Truffles ($2.50 each) Cookies & Cream and Peanut Butter Chocolate  [19]  For those who may have stuffed themselves but still really just need something sweet to end the meal, you've got to check out these one-bite pleasures. With Halloween around the corner, these put those little \"fun size\" bars to shame.   [22]  Closing Remarks  -For 2 cocktails, 2 ciders, and 8 dishes, the bill came to $135 including tax and tip. Best-deal-ever. Seriously, the price just solidifies what a perfect option Thoroughbred would be for an inexpensive casual date or a night out with a group of friends as the menu and prices can fit any budget or taste. -In conclusion, the whole experience at Thoroughbred was exactly what I was craving- laid back, accommodating and fun. The service was friendly and professional, the space was comforting and inviting, and the food and drink truly exceeded my expectations. I also felt like there were so many things on both the food and beverage menus that I was dying to try, so I can't wait to return for round two. I'm also looking forward to seeing what's in store for the full dinner menu upstairs, and awaiting the announcement of what's happening with the 3rd floor."}
{"text":"We came to T.O. as a group of 10 before a show in the Queen / Spadina area and were looking for a proper nearby restaurant that wasn't all fancy pants or just a bar that served food and could comfortably seat that many on a Saturday night. Found this place online ahead of time, spoke to them and secured our reservation via a Yelp message, and decided to go with the chef's tasting option after checking back with the group.   We were placed at a table in a great location within the front section of the lower level and then let the staff take over.  All food and drink was wonderful and the servers were excellent and very good at explaining the nuances of each new dish we were about to try.  The selection was wonderfully inventive and very tasty, with the portions just about the right size so that everyone was satiated by the time the dessert course finished up.  At the beginning some in our group were worried that the portions were too small but then the samplings of new and wonderful things just kept coming and coming.  I was the organizer and all couples were complimenting me on the choice and gave the experience 2 thumbs up afterwards.  As for dishes, we echo the ones already raved upon by the patrons in the reviews before us...it seems the restaurant knows a good dish when it has one on it's hands and trots those out repeatedly, for we had most of the signature dishes I read about beforehand."}
{"text":"First of all, unlimited sparkling water free of charge for the win. But besides that, all of the courses had a depth of flavour that's beyond any big-shot winterlicious restaurants I've ever had.   Their signature kung pao cauliflower and roasted butternut squash apps had bold and balanced flavours. Normally not a fan of cilantro, the microcilantro used for the cauliflower was just enough to remind you of some green herbal element without giving you an entire mouthwash. The pickling juice soaked into the buffalo mozzarella from the pickled raisins for the squash app was the star of the plate for me as well.   Our mains, a roasted half Cornish game hen on barley risotto and hen of the woods gnocchi was again a showcase of the depth of flavours TBTO so masterfully achieves. In the mains' case though, the flavours were built straight into the sauce via the stock they used.   Finally, dessert was a chocolate mud pie and an apple crumble. Both were excellent.  One thing I want to emphasize os that the servers were very attentive. I was actually catching a flight and needed to be in and out within 40 minutes. And they were more than prepared. Each course was presented as just as we finished the previous and I was able to enjoy my meal without feeling rushed. Big thank you to the TBTO team!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a awesome experience.  My wife and I went a few weeks ago for dinner. We were blown away by the food. Both of us are vegan, so we didn't know what to expect. It turns out they have a full vegan/vegetarian menu! The Kung Pao Cauliflower was the star, but we also really enjoyed the Waldorf Salad and the Roast Broccoli Marrow .  Service was excellent. Our server helped us choose some really tasty cocktails.  The place is newly renovated and looks like it gets pretty fun after dinner.  Overall, very happy."}
{"text":"Excellent service, tasting menu and sommelier.  Great place for a date night or a group friends."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. I've been here twice recently and had excellent experiences both times. The menu is limited, but everything I tried was excellent."}
{"text":"4.5/5! Highly recommend the tasting menu! Great oysters, Kung pao cauliflower is fabulous and I loved the duck! You can't go wrong with any of their recos! The chef does a fantastic variation of fish and chips. The only downside was the gin cocktail- it was too sweet for my liking!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Fabulous, polite staff. Exceptional food.  Had my first T.B expereince last night and it was quite spectacular! I was greeted with a warm welcome and ALL of the staff that assisted my table were kind, pleasant and chill. Loved that they had a vegan/ vegetarian option to the menu. Kung Pao Cauliflower = to die for. Everything from the cocktail presentation to the funky doors in the bathroom made it a unique and fun experience! Will totally revisit this funky, eclectic joint!"}
{"text":"No complaints about this restaurant but it didn't have enough wow factor for me to give it 5 stars.   I came here with a group of friends for Winterlicious. We tried a variety of apps, mains and desserts, and every dish was plated thoughtfully and tasted good. The service was also on point, with water refills coming throughout the evening, even long after we paid the bill. TIP: sparking water does not cost you extra at this restaurant and they refill the water at the same rate as the flat water.   The overall ambiance makes you feel like you're at a cottage, with rustic furnishings and candles on the table. The lights were dimmed and the seating was cozy - I think this would be a great place to take a date! Would come back again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Creative dishes in design but the taste is mediocre. I had their signature cauliflower dish to start which was good but sauce was bit overdone. I had their lamb and pickerel as mains. lamb was very well cooked and delicious. the fish was well cooked as well but the accompanying sides like the rice pilaf was bland. The portions are quite small considered they are for sharing. Your bill will rack up considerably after a couple of dishes. The service and ambiance was good. The servers are quite attentive to your need, which is always nice."}
{"text":"I had to make a Yelp account just to give these guys a review because the food was so amazing.  We had the $45 dollar \"Let us cook for you\" tasting menu.  Everything we had exceeded my expectations.   We had 10 different dishes served to us and not a single one disappointed.  Everything was extremely fresh, and the chef perfectly paired each ingredient.   We were told by our server that the tasting menu changes everyday based on what the chef creates each night.   The service and ambience were also excellent. We are definitely returning to this little gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"Reservations were easy to make and our table was ready on time. We ordered many dishes and shared them among 4 of us, and were really happy with every dish. Overall experience was excellent and am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went to Thoroughbred a couple of days ago, I had last been about a year ago.  The food was quite good, with the star of the meal being the Kung Pao Cauliflower. It was quite tasty and the only disappointing part about this dish, is the plating otherwise its a definite must order.  We also ordered the pork belly with spaghetti squash. The pork belly was slightly overcooked but the dish still had plenty of flavour.  The only downside of the meal was the time it took to get my drink (one of their specialty cocktails). I ordered my drink when we arrived and I didn't receive it till well after all the food had arrived. The staff was quite attentive, checking on us multiple times, and I brought to their attention that I was still waiting on my drink. Sadly this still did not expedite the order. In the end they comp'd the drink and apologised.  Overall the drink was good (when it arrived), the Kung Pao Cauliflower is worth having again, and the service is quite attentive. I just hope that next time attentiveness translates to action."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to the entertainment district which suffers from good food options located right across the Scotia theatre. Most of the items are unique, we tried the kung pao cauliflower which was tasty, the broccoli carpaccio which was tender but not overly flavourful and the chicken liver pate which was as expected. The steak shared between six of us felt expensive, as it tasted fine but wouldn't recommend. The best thing was the lamb sausage. They had a lamb shank special which was disappointing and hard to share despite the restaurant refering to the menu as best for sharing. Service was good. In summary, the food is good, though pricey and menu limited."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterliciois as a date on Friday night. Comfy and intimate setting, based in a hollowed out town house stretched over all three stories.  Amazing food and a good assortment of drinks. I have never had so much fun eating squash before. Got the flat iron as a main which came back a perfect medium-rare, and date got the gnocchi. The portions are small, yes, but they make each bite count. The cocktails were delightful; like the food, small but mighty.   Located just across the street from Scotiabank theatre makes this a great place to get away from the crowds after seeing a movie or meeting up with friends for a drink after work and aren't feeling the press of Jack Astor's, Milestones, etc. Great place to spend time with someone."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite restaurant in Toronto!!! I was there on their first night of opening in 2014 and although I have a personal connection with one of the owners, the food has never disappointed. You must try the Kung Pao Cauliflower as it is their signature dish and basically irresistible. Have been there probably 10+ times and have never been disappointed. Everything on the menu is soooo good."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here for a late-night snack and cocktail. Tried the kung pao cauliflower and fell in love with it! What a perfect little plate of food. Inventive cocktails, friendly service. The place itself is a little sterile (in terms of the atmosphere), but the hostess made up for it with her warm approach!"}
{"text":"Kung Pow Cauliflower!! All the way!! Never did I think cauliflower could taste so good. Also had the Brussels Sprouts Caesar, also never thought brussels sprouts could taste so good too. I think Thoroughbred has successfully made me like food I never thought I'd love. I also love the atmosphere here - mood lighting, big wooden communal tables. Service is top notch too. The only downside is that it can get really loud."}
{"text":"Well weren't we pleasantly surprised. Yep, read a bunch of reviews, saw the 4/5 stars (at the time, hoping this creeps up further) and decided to check out Thoroughbred. It was excellent.  First, when I made the reso, Christina was great. I told her what was happening, she suggested some better timings, had a table set aside for us and was just plain pleasant - a good start.  We showed up a few minutes late, and....not a problem, \"we were waiting for you Chris!\" A nice way to be greeted. Anna took us to our table and was part of our serving team because everyone there brought us something at some point! Everyone was cool, but no one was stand-off-ish or too-cool-for you.   The drink menu is arguably as good as the gustatory event that was awaiting, and with a few suggestions, we were drinking clever cocktails. When my guest asked for a bit of an obscure wine, yep, they had it and we're excited to get the cork outta that thing, and get the vino into our glasses (along with a nod to my guest for her choice).   We did the only clever thing you can do there, and chose the \"We cook for you\" option. With a couple of questions about allergies and gluten, etc., they were off and running and the plates started coming. It was excellent. Every single plate (and I think it ended being 10) was excellent, thoughtful, nicely done, hot on arrival, tasty, and smart, but not stupid-smart if you know what I mean.  If you are humming and hawing about where to go, stop thinking and obey - go to Thoroughbred. I'll be back.  Shout out to Christina, Anna, Kevin, Justin (your tunes created a sweet vibe) and to the cool guy with the accent who's name I can't remember and to the the guy with the cool piercings who brought us the sausage. You guys were simply great at creating a primo experience. Nicely done and see you soon."}
{"text":"Despite the horse logo, Thoroughbred does not serve horse.  Nor do they sell live horses.  I mean, I didn't double check with the waitstaff or anything, but I'm pretty sure it's a negative.   Even though I feel that everyone has a horse except for me - and that visiting Thoroughbred has brought me closer to a real, live My Little Pony, my experience here tonight was a positive one.   The vibe is, of course, a little hipstery with the unvarnished tables, generally dim but cozy interior and vintage-style cutlery.  I say \"of course\" because it's pretty much in the Queen Street West district.  In a nice way though. No pretentions and no staff who pretend to be too cool to emote.  As I mentioned before, these peeps are nice. Shoutouts to the gentleman who greeted at the door and Sandra, the pleasant lady who provided friendly service and great dish recommendations.  My date/main girl for life and I split the Kung Pao Cauliflower ($11) and Chicken Seine ($79).  Soigne, says Google, is essentially being dressed in fancy gear, and a term generally reserved for the hoomins.  Cuuute.   The cauliflower had a crisp exterior, with a great ratio of sauce to keep it interesting without making it soggy,  almost like tapping through the top of a creme brulee.  My companion remarked that she loved the almost lemony acidity of the sauce. Helpful to make way in our tummies too, as it was followed by a two person share of the chicken.   Packed around a finger's width of foie gras, the chicken is rolled, packed, and cut into neat 2-inch circles and topped with a sliver of black truffle each.  The chicken is served with a gravy of the chicken jus mixed with Madeira and other ingredients.  The most important part of the gravy is that it's served in a little pouring container (my guess is it's meant for milk in coffee) which is shaped like a miniature white cow.  The gravy comes out of its mouth.  I found this pretty much hilarious!  I am easily amused, but I digress.  The chicken was moist and juicy, and I suspect sous-vide was at play.  Even without the gravy, the chicken was delicious.  My only wish is that the foie gras was seared, but that's always my preferred method of eating foie anyway.   For dessert, we had truffles.  A choice of 5 flavours, each truffle is $2.50, or $10 for the flight of all flavours.  M'lady enjoyed her peanut butter in dark chocolate, and while my honey ganache milk chocolate was too sweet for my personal tastes, I would still be willing to try the others.   All in all, I would be willing to come back again, and would recommend it as a cozy date spot where you can actually chat and enjoy the food and company.   Tip: Ask for seating upstairs, which is much quieter than the downstairs bar seating."}
{"text":"We got the Valentine's Day special menu. They have two options $55/$65. We got 65 because I just wanted to try everything haha.   The restaurant is kind of dark and the tables are close to each other (which is pretty normal for downtown). But the ambiance was relaxing and overall very warming.  The food were all very good! We've never been here for their normal menu but I have nothing bad to say about any of the dishes that we had. The oysters and the ceviche were very fresh. We both loved the beef tarte, even though the texture might have been a little close to the tough side. The desserts were both really good!"}
{"text":"Recently went to Thoroughbred with a friend of because of all the hype.  The Good - Everything tasted incredible - As everyone else has mentioned, the kung pao cauliflower is sublime - The chicken liver mousse was also excellent. It had all the good flavours of a liver pate with minimal amounts of that unsettling aroma or aftertaste - Everything looks really pretty - The drinks were all awesome.   The Bad - Portion sizes - Prices can wildly vary -- when we went there was a menu item that was $60 or something like that, and coupled with the sometimes diminutive portion sizes, this can be an issue   This is definitely a really great place to bring a date, the food is all really good. But either you both don't have really big appetites, or you end up spending a lot of money to get full... or you go to McDonalds after. That said, it's really good at what it does and worth a visit! They also had a great Tuesday special for Fried chicken that you can find on their social media pages.  For a full review and more pictures, take a look at the blog post on my website, located conveniently in my yelp profile!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night (impromptu, no reservation, just checked Yelp for the area we were in) and really enjoyed the drinks and food.  This is a nice cozy place with a good vibe.  We both did a prix fixe menu and got kung pao cauliflower, falafel, short rib, some chicken dish, strawberry panna cotta (w/rubarb shavings), and the cookie.  Everything was really good, but the cauliflower and short rib seem to stick in my memory as the best."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pre-show dinner on Friday night. Lovely decor (dark stained wood, sort of industrial light fixtures, hipster-trendy loveliness). Music a touch loud for aging parents, but luckily it was just us 30-somethings this time. Not crowded when we arrived but got busy as we were leaving around 7. We shared the kung pao cauliflower (TO DIE FOR) which was crispy outside and perfectly cooked so as not to be mushy. The sauce was delicious. Garnished with cashews and fresh hot peppers and amazing, spicy sauce. Next we shared the flank steak, also quite tasty with all its extras: greens, roasted carrots, and a tangy mustard sauce. Meat was a touch underdone for our taste, and we weren't asked how we wanted it cooked when we ordered. But when we asked for it to be cooked a bit more, the server quickly obliged and it tasted even more delicious after a bit more time in the pan. Overall, a great dining experience. We will definitely be back. And we will each get our own order of kung pao cauliflower so there are no fights."}
{"text":"The limited menu felt stale and the high ratings seem grossly undeserved. We went with a group menu after our server assured us that the kitchen could accommodate any and all food allergies. One member of our party was lactose intolerant - an issue that seemed completely new to both the server and the kitchen. Even after a detailed conversation about lactose intolerance - as dishes from the group menu arrived, one after another contained cheese/milk/cream or  sauces were completely omitted. This led to uncomfortable moments, including one course where our friend was told to eat off the far edge of a shared plate. Other courses he missed out entirely. Drinks didn't come out in a timely manner. No attempt was made by the staff to address major service flaws even after they were brought to the restaurant's attention. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Happy to have stumbled upon this cute converted Victorian house turned restaurant.  This was a good choice for cocktails with some sharing plates.  We let the server make recommendations for food and drinks and was satisfied with the choices made.  Ended up trying the kung pao califlower (signature dish it seems - saucy and flavourful but missing a crunch or crispiness in the texture), brussel sprouts caesar (tasty and unique but I wish there were more brussel sprouts), the pogos (yummy but small), rueben sandwich (the meat was almost too soft for my liking) and tons of cocktails (too many to mention and admit to having, but all were deliciously boozy).  Ordering bartender's choice was the best decision of the night since I got to try a variety of cocktails not listed on the menu.  Verdict: The staff is very friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is not douchy or too hipsterish, and the cocktails are lush-worthy, but the price of food is a tad high for what is it.  All in all, a good experience but nothing there that wowed me to definitely return.  Although, seeing jello shots as an option was a funny surprise."}
{"text":"Incredible   Try the tasting menu, the best items:  -mushroom toast  -gnocchi -Kung pao cauliflower   Server was a wine pro!   You have to check this place out"}
{"text":"We stopped in late after seeing a show at Roy Thomson hall so we were limited to ordering off the bar menu. We weren't starving so this was perfect for us. We had the duck confit nachos and the buttermilk fried sweetbreads. Both were excellent as was the service and selection of local brews.  We couldn't decide on a desert choice so we we went \"all in\" and sampled them all, which I didn't regret at all.  Our server was  attentive and happy to share information about our food and beverage options. We will definitely visit again the next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"TL;DR: I want their recipe book. Nuff said.   Did a random search on Yelp for restaurants in the entertainment district and came upon Thoroughbred... Located in the oddest of places and totally under the radar.   So happy I found it.   Two of us came for a pre-show meal and went with the Chef's Menu of 10 items. Our only complaint is we weren't notified that this would imply a 3-hour sitting. We sadly had to downgrade to 8-courses and that was rushed so we could make our show (which we were late for).   Outside of this hiccup - the experience was great.   Drinks: Revivalists and a whisky based drink and Shere Khan jello shots. Loved them all!  Food: Everything was great with standouts including the Cauliflower, Greek Salad, Cod, and Sausage. Did I mention the super delicious cookie?  Next Time: Would recommend to anyone and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night which happens to be their famous Chicken & Crazy Cheap Champaigne Night!  The bar seating area is very hip with the upbeat music and dim lights (so if you want to take photos, best to go during lunch!)  Upstairs there are more normal dining area, which was closed when we went due to some event. And there's also a Chef's Table where you are seated next to the kitchen so you can see the staff and kitchen operations in their form. You will also get to see Chef Ariel Coplan if you are seated there.  One thing I love about their food is it is carefully crafted such that it's about the entire dish, and not just a specific part of the dish e.g. the meat only, or the chickpeas only... It's the mix of it all together!  DRINKS: NV Brut Cava | 5 Glass / 25 Bottle - Since it is Crazy Cheap Champaigne Night, we are obviously getting champagne! Their selection of champagne is made to pair with their Buttermilk Fried Chicken. So if you are going on Tuesdays, it is best to get this combination!  The 6ix God | Bowmore + Amaretto + Fernet + Bacon + Bacon Fat | 16 - Love this cocktail drink! There's two things to this that just makes it such a fun drink. One is the drink itself that is infused in bacon fat... so delicious! And the other one is the bacon that is in this drink... so now it's reversed: bacon infused with cocktail :)   APPETIZERS: Beef Tartare Truffle | 15 - This is one of the best tartares I've had. The earthiness of the truffle and the acidity of the tartare just went so well together.  Oysters | with Charred Jalapeno and Apple | 3.5/pc - Really fresh oysters and the toppings gave it a nice sweet + spicy kick. However, for a non-oyster connoisseur, best to stick to dollar oyster places.  Chicharon | 7 - I love Chicharon so was definitely going to try the chicharon here. These were so delicious! The rind was perfectly crackled. The sourness of the lime balanced with the creaminess of the ranch and the spiciness of the chili.   MAINS: Branzino Golden Curry | 27 - This was my favorite item of the night! The branzino was perfectly cooked and the curry with chickpeas was so flavourful. What I love about it is that both are already good on its own. But when you combine them together, it's just a whole new level.   Buttermilk Fried Chicken | 15 - This was very interesting. They brine the chicken for 24 hours and sous-vide it to 60 degrees Celsius so it's perfectly cooked. I can say this was the most tender chicken I've had. A note though, we initially thought the chicken was still raw since it had pinkish color in it. But it's apparently like that because of the sous-vide process, so it maintains that color even though it's perfectly cooked and tender already. The buttermilk breading was very different than your usual fried chicken - I actually still prefer the breading of southern style fried chicken (but to each their own). The breading fell apart as I picked up the chicken.   DESSERTS: Chocolate Chip Cookie Vanilla Ice Cream |  8 - Chocolate cookie on an iron skillet, baked to order and topped with vanilla ice cream and salted caramel. This reminds me of something I had at BJ's Restaurant in LA called Pizookie (Pizza Cookie) but it's the first time I've seen it in Toronto. Compared to the one I tried in LA, this was a thicker cookie which bordered into a moist cake as well. So delicious especially when the ice cream melts into the cake!  Rhubarb Cinnamon buns | 8 - This was a little unremarkable to me. I felt there was nothing special especially when, for the same price, you can get the chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal restaurant and one of my favourites in Toronto. They take simple dishes but elevate them to fine dining refinery without comprising flavour, delivering both gastronomy and 'homeyness' simultaneously."}
{"text":"Went here for date night recently, and opted for the $65 tasting menu. Plenty of food, I was stuffed by the end! We opted for a more meat heavy menu, being less fond of seafood.  First up were a pair of oysters. Pretty good, even for people that don't like seafood. Next was the quinoa/beet salad and Kung pao cauliflower, both of which were delicious. Then came the brussel sprout ceasar salad, pretty good. The pork belly on ginger spaghetti squash was to die for, pork fell off the bone and the flavour of the squash was amazing and unique. The chicken liver mousse fell a little short, lacking flavour. By the time we made it to the sausage I could barely eat anything else, but it's served on a fire which is a fun treat. I managed to stuff in dessert, and I'm so glad I did. A fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with ice cream and chocolate drizzle - great end to a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great dinner. The kung pao cauliflower was outstanding. Really. We also ordered the brussel sprout ceasar salad with a poached egg, which was good, and the Chorizo which was roasted on the table. The banana split was fantastic, the deconstructed lemon meringue was good. Portions are small, but everything is very flavorful.  Service was attentive and friendly.  $38 for splitting one main, two apps, and two desserts three ways with one glass of wine.  I'd go back just for the cauliflower. Seriously."}
{"text":"Tiny gem downtown. Because it is fairly small, it's better to come early or make a reservation if coming with a larger group of people.  Thoroughbred's specialty is delicious drinks and apps (mainly) altho they do have some mains as well. The burger is spectacular, and would highly recommend if you're in for a meal. Otherwise, their shareable apps with a few cocktails make a great evening out here.   It is a little bit on the pricier side, but have specials of some apps for $5. The $5 specials do change from time to time, so it's worth coming back and trying something new/different."}
{"text":"Tried again for a full proper dinner and had a much better time.  Place was so quiet - very few other people.    Shared the reuban sandwich, broccoli salad, brussels sprouts caesar and the albacore tuna.  Everything was really good - the tastes and concepts reminded me of Daisho, which is funny, since the manager at Thoroughbred used to be the manager at momofuku....  Reuban sandwich was made with warm, pickled veal tongue, which was great.  Messy, but good.  The brussels sprouts were fried and they came with a runny egg to mush about.  Sashimi style tuna matched well with crunchy cut up asparagus.  I would definitely go back for dinner,and would recommend dining family style/sharing.  I stayed away from the cocktails this time and just had wine, which was lovely.  High price point for what you get because of the area, but overall a good, positive experience."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have our staff dinner and I suggested Thoroughbred based on the awesome meal that my boyfriend and I had here a couple of weeks ago. I think it's safe to say that everyone loved the food and had a great time.   We sat at the Chef's Table and watched all the food go out. The $55 pp tasting menu was great and probably the perfect amount for everyone.   Service was wonderful. We had several people helping us out but they all communicated well and it made for a great night out.  Thanks, Thoroughbred. You are a new favourite of mine!"}
{"text":"I went in earlier today and asked for take out. They stated they don't usually do take out but will make the exception. All the staff were worried about the food not tasting the same but it tasted AMAZING!!   I read about the Kung Pao Cauliflower with previous reviews and made sure to order that. I also ordered the Lamb Chorizo as my main course.   Both dishes were delicious and would highly recommend it.   I am visiting from Vancouver and this has definitely made my must eat list when I come back."}
{"text":"The daily special was fried chicken and crazy cheap champagne, but it was a tasting menu kind of night for us.   The food was good and served in some interesting ways: the Assador de Barro is house-made sausage set on fire in a pig clay dish.   The cocktails and conversation were flowing. I loved the bourbon and fig pairing in the Otto e Mezzo, but the highlight of the evening was connecting with a kindred spirit.   Not a bad Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Awesome! Best, most artfully prepared meal I've had in a long time.  We had the \"choose for me\" option and it was great.  Oysters with plum vinegar was a great combo. Smoked char and potato salad was exceptional. A salad dressed with a smoked, slow cooked egg was amazing.  Kung po cauliflower is addictive!   Everything about this place was great.  Comfortable room.  Friendly service. Great beers at reasonable prices. Music was pleasant and not overpowering.  But it's the chef that really stands out.   Everything was inventive, delicious and very satisfying with no gimmicks or need to rely on crazy ingredients.  There is a quiet humility and real love of food that shines through in everything here. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"The menu is limited and that can be an issue for finicky eaters. The cauliflower dish is truly amazing as others have mentioned. The local pale ale served on tap is a nice choice. The atmosphere is quaint and nice. The service is attentive and prompt. They don't take American Express cards."}
{"text":"What can I say. The staff are top quality, the winterlious menu was really delicious. Homemade peanut butter cookie with vanilla ice-cream a must. They'll make any cocktail you ask. Decor is spot on from the front door to the bathrooms. Nothing has been left to chance. Honestly and truly a brilliant dinner/ drinks spot. We'll be back weekly!!"}
{"text":"Giving them +1 star because after reading my Yelp review, they not only reached out to me to apologize for what happened, but also invited me back to try and remedy the situation.  I must give credit to a business when they make a good attempt at service recovery because it shows they do listen to their customers and they do care. I couldn't return but I still appreciate the notion."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to get the chicken and champagne while on our visit to Toronto. It was absolutely yummy and this is coming from a very picky southern girl. I also had the chicken liver mouse and it was divine. I would absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"A Canadian style but featured as its Chinese cooking meals. Cocktail is good but  meals are salty and too much powder."}
{"text":"The food quality was good but a bit pricy for the portion. I went there for a dinner and drink night. I ordered the cauliflower and octopus. The cauliflower was delicious and I would definitely order it again. But the octopus was a bit disappointing. The portion is so small and it doesn't have too much taste.   The service was good and it is a very cozy hipsterish environment. I would go back there for drinks with friends but not for dinner. They don't have too many options on the food menu and too little food for each dish."}
{"text":"The service here was great - which is why I'm giving them 2 stars. The food was terrible.    My bf and I both ordered the steak.  It comes with barley.  The steak came pretty raw -- which would've been fine if it had any flavour.  I had to send it back to cook some more. The barley was pretty flavourless. Tasted like I was having oatmeal with my steak. Definitely wasn't worth the money"}
{"text":"If you're in the area to see a movie at Scotiabank Theatre across the street, you can't go wrong coming here first rather than going to any of a dozen Chinese-run Monster Truck McSushi Roll places or McBurrito joints nearby (save that crap for when you're in the 905 and desperate)   The menu changes daily so email the restaurant beforehand and thy will promptly reply with a PDF of the menu.    Word of warning, although they open at 5PM the kitchen doesn't open until 5:30 so you're stuck with drinks until then. This is one reason why I cannot give them 4 or 5 stars; if they advertise a 5PM opening I expect to be able to order food at 5PM, not order it at 5 and then have to wait till 5:45 to receive it which is what happened.  It is a very narrow restaurant so noise has nowhere to go and conversation can be difficult.  Also, don't expect to get full here, portions are small.  The cheddar cornbread was shared but realistically it's sized for one, barely.  We chose the banquet burger and at least we felt this was a decent sized entree.  They cook the burger to medium-rare and this was perfect, the beef was excellent quality and was probably ground in-house the same day.  Nice char on the outside, pink in the centre.  Delicious.  Apple crumble cheesecake was an interesting take on these classics... constructed to order rather than sliced out of a larger pie as you'd expect."}
{"text":"After a long night bar hoping, we ended the night at this restaurant. We were seated promptly upstairs and were only here for drinks. Upon heading to our table,  we had passed by the chef's table that was located next to the kitchen in its separate room.   Drinks were same as anywhere else but service was great.  The restaurant is hidden and without my friends leading the way, I would not know about this place. Definitely will try the food here next time."}
{"text":"The word you are looking for is pretentious, there are better, cheaper, more comfortable or classier or more hip/fun restaurants in Toronto for less. The portions are pitiful, I get what they are trying to do, a tapas style sharable plates, it is not lost on me. I can see the hours of thought and work put into making a menu the owner might find creative. The execution however is a total miss. If you want to do tapas, then do real tapa style food, a cup with 5 overcooked potato wedges in them does not/shouldn't count as one, nor does it warrant a 5 dollar price tag.   This was definitely the most confusing dining experience I have had, not only was the menu confusing, the food, style, execution was all over the place, you will find oysters, full burgers ($20!! Please just go to Burger Priest), trout salad with a few leafs of vegetables and even fewer juliennes of bland trout scattered over a plate ($20?), asian inspired cauliflower ($14) and loads of other undistinguishable items both in flavour and name.  This is a bar first, but if you want better atmosphere go literally anywhere else on the same street, if you want good food, save your money and go literally anywhere within 2 blocks of here, if you want to have hipster gatherings on other people's dime and then pretend to like small generic at best food, then this might be the place for you, although there are still better choices for that.  Just a hunch, based on the menu style, the name, and the ambience, it is trying really hard to be the Blackhoof. I can see why, since it is an insanely popular and very lucrative restaurant. However, to put them at the same level is really unthinkable, they both have a ignorance and pretentiousness to them, but at the end of the day, only one puts out hearty and great tasting food, that satisfies your pallet and your curiosity, while the other one not only falls short, but leaves you with a ripped off feeling $100+ later."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. The pan-roasted octopus was spot on. Perfectly prepared and seasoned as was the kung pao cauliflower. It was nice to get a cocktail that was perfectly mixed- the perfect liquor pour. Next time we got back we want to do the Chefs Menu- thats the option on the bottom of the menu that says something like\"Ask your Server to guide you.\""}
{"text":"I arrived here for dinner with my partner in crime a few days ago to celebrate a birthday  and to eat! Beyond just their regular menu there is also an option to \"Have them cook for you\". In short you set a price per person and then just sit back and be prepared for surprises.   Before diving into what tasty magic arrived lets cover off the equally important aspects of a good dining experience - service and of course (at least for me - cocktails). Service was spot on there were a few servers floating around as it was a quieter night but I can't say I for a minute ever had an empty wine glass or water. Every one of the magical plates that arrived was explained and questions answered. As a comparison if you've ever eaten in New York (and quite a few places in toronto) you'll know what I mean when I say they are all over it.   Now the booze; we primarily stuck to wine for the meal (it's on tap!) but did start with two cocktails; the Shaolin Iced Tea which comes in a brown stubby bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag. A mix of mezcal, rum and a few other tasty things it was wonderful (I have the memory of a goldfish sometimes). The partner who is a sucker for anything with egg whites had the Art Vendelay which is a wonderful mix of sweet and bitter.   Now for the important part...food.   We started off with a round of oysters and to go along with it they included cooled butter poached prawns seasoned with a thai sauce that balanced sweet and heat wonderfully. The oysters  came already dressed with mignonette & horseradish.   Now time to shorten this down and get to the point the overall TL:DR is this...go here, sample anything on the menu - you won't be disappointed. If you do the let us cook for you the meal ends up being a wonderfuly balanced with a mix of some heavier dishes and a lot of light fresh food. The slightly longer summary of the rest of the meal goes like so:  -Chicken Liver Mousse with a Carrot Bread - the carrot bread was the perfect vessel to deliver the tasty chicken liver alongside the cherry gastrique that came on the plate. We licked the plate clean.   -Beet Salad - my partner in crime hates beets; we finished it and her only comment was I could eat beets like that anyday.   -Kung Pao Cauliflower - Flavourful with an absolute wonderful texture to the cauliflower.   -\"Fish and Chips\" - kitchens own take on what could be seen as fish and chips. The fish (fresh ontario lake trout) was not fried or battered but all the components included. You grab it with your fork, bite and its like a very light and wonderful bite of fish and chips  -Deconstructed Lemon Meringue - the meal was concluded with an extremely light and tasty dessert.   So yes as noted earlier...go here...try (even an app or two) and I don't believe you'll leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for Vday tonight to try their prix fixe menu (usually called their \"let us cook for you\" taster menu).  Food: 4/5. Lost a star for unexpected blandness with some of their dishes, such as the starter salad and the cauliflower portion of the entree. My favorite was the sunchoke tart, which was just the right balance of tangy, buttery, and crispy. The seitan portion of the entree was also well flavored - a bit sour, so might be a hit or miss for some folks. I was not overly impressed with the pear sorbet dessert - it was small and too wholesome lol. Never thought I would complain about that, but all I could taste was raw pear. The red velvet cake was great though! The dark chocolate portion was not at all sweet; rather, salty was the main flavor. The beet meringue simply melted in our mouths.  Value: 3/5. Not cheap, especially since portion sizes run really small. My partner was definitely still hungry. If I didn't consume dinner part 1 already tonight I would be too. Come for special occasions.  Service: 5/5. Super accommodating to my and my partner's dietary restrictions (he's a vegetarian who doesn't eat eggs and I asked for fully vegan tonight with the exception of a small amount of butter used in the sunchoke tart), which we told them at the restaurant, so super last minute. Same with their regular prix fixe/\"let us cook for you\" taster menu - they will accommodate literally ALL of your dietary restrictions. The server told us that previously they were even able to successfully craft a taster menu for a pregnant customer who was vegan and on a gluten-free diet due to Celiac disease.   Venue: 5/5. QUIET. And romantic, but not overly dark like at many dimly candlelit restaurants. Ask as part of your online reservation to sit upstairs where it's more romantic and quieter since away from the bar on the main floor. Restrooms are located on the 1st floor at the very back - kind of hard to find at first.  Final tip: Make a reservation well in advance if you want to come at a reasonable hour for dinner, even if it's not Vday."}
{"text":"What a pleasant find! Located right across the Scotiabank theatre, this is a 2 story bar and eatery converted from a homey and rustic house on Richmond street.   Relatively small and cozy with comfortable noise level and lighting, the atmosphere of the place was great. The most surprising part was the entrance of a DJ at around 9pm on a Friday to play some live beats right on the first floor dining area - what?? Love it.  They have a relatively small menu with the food being mainly sharing plate style. Portions are on the smaller side but we got a bunch of things to share and plate by plate there was an unanimous thumbs up from us - loved all the dishes!   To start, we got some oysters ($3.5 each) - fresh and lots of onion in this which I'm a fan of. We couldn't pass up on the popular Kung pao cauliflower ($12) - coated in a thick and sticky sweet and sour sauce, the taste and texture reminds me of breaded sweet and sour shrimp. A TAD too salty for my liking but delicious nonetheless. The flaming pork sausages were also a highlight and our group devoured the 2 links within minutes!   Dessert was also pretty bomb. We ordered all 3 options on the menu. The baked cookie ice cream was too sweet but the apple crumble was really good - tangy and refreshing.  Great experience here and was able to soak in creativity from the food and plating to the environment. Will be back!"}
{"text":"After dining at a nearby location we were a bit short on having a good time so we looked at Yelp and found Thoroughbred near by, so away we went. We sat at the bar and asked for suggestions. Julian went right at it and steered us towards just what we needed. After trying a couple different cocktails we ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie for desert, and man were we knocked out. A great little desert. The whole experience left us wanting more so next time we head that direction Thoroughbred will be our first stop, not our last."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday just with my sister. Visiting Toronto I wanted to go somewhere with a tasting menu that would take a last minute reservation. We made the reservation the day of so it was hard going to the original places I wanted. When we came to Thoroughbred we were seated right away. The place wasn't crowded at all which I thought was weird for a Friday night. We chose the tasting menu which is just \"Have the chef cook for you\" or something like that on the menu and ordered a few cocktails. The tasting menu came with three options a small, medium, and large. We ended up choosing the large where we would get more plates. Our waitress said it was a lot of food and that most people don't eat it all... We ate it all... I don't know what kind of people come here but it was not that much. The tasting menu also included meals on and off the menu.   The first dish were 2 oysters and a chicharron. The fosters were good and the chicharron was salty but a good starter. It reminded me of a dish that was served at the Aviary because they also prepared a pork appetizer like that. Cornbread which was presented in some weird way that looked like they just pulled it apart rather than cut it. It looked sloppy. We had the broccoli falafel which I wasn't the biggest fan of and my sisters was burnt. Carrot gnocchi which was actually pretty good. The brown butter and sage in it made it flavorful. The octopus was really good but it was such a small portion! I wish there was more! The sea bass came with israeli couscous. I really liked the sea bass but the israeli couscous was basically the star of the dish. We also had a pate and a salad. The salad was very fresh. In all I probably wouldn't have ordered the tasting menu and picks a few items and share it with my sister. It was nice sampling everything so I would know what to get if I go there next time. If I go there again that is.  The highlight of the whole meal were probably the drinks, honestly. They have a good list of cocktails and a well stocked bar. I would probably just be back for drinks if I'm in the area.   The part that made this experience bitter for me was the service. This place was basically empty when we came so we expected the waitresses (There were about 3 that night) to be attentive. Or at least the waitress that was waiting our table to be more attentive. To be fair I honestly didn't know who my waitress was. I kept receiving the drinks and food from different people. When I asked to see the drink menu I was ignored until I asked a second time. My water glass was empty basically all the time. At the end of the meal my sister and I were questioning if we did something to them that made them upset. We didn't by the way. For a place to be offering high quality food they need to be more attentive to their customers. My sister and I would have stayed their ordering more cocktails but we felt like we weren't even wanted. This totally put a damper on my birthday weekend."}
{"text":"Last night my blended family of 6 and I went to Thoroughbred for my mom's birthday and had the most amazing time. First thing you have to know about Thoroughbred is don't let the menu intimidate you. It doesn't read very well, and it's a little bit confusing but everything was phenomenal -more than phenomenal! We ordered every almost everything on the menu, I think the terrine was the only thing we didn't have but I wish we did because we almost ordered 2 of everything, getting halfway through a dish and realizing we wanted more and more. The steak for two is market price and can run you quite a bit of cash, but everyone at the table managed to eat a bunch of steak, plus it came with 3 fantastic sides. Everything completely blew us away but the 5 stand out items in my opinion were: the chicken liver mousse, the famous cauliflower, the oysters, the steak (which they brought to us before they cooked it to show us the gorgeous marbling of fat in the massive thing), and after I blabbed on and on about reading about the foie gras poptarts, they brought us out a trio which we completely devoured. The food, service, and experience were all just perfect. For a new restaurant, I am floored at how perfect dinner was. Even my 18 year old step brother ate every single thing, literally licking plates clean."}
{"text":"All the dishes we ordered were on point but I found myself slightly disappointed by a few things.  The cauliflower lives up to the hype taste wise but I though it would've been crispy - we received some soft deep fried cauliflower. The brussel sprout caesar salad was very light on the sprouts and was mostly lettuce, but it did come with a poached egg on top which was delicious.  We got the Chicken Soignee main which was foie, wrapped in dark meat, wrapped in white meat. It came with gravy and spinach. It was really quite good but at a $79 price point for two people we found it to be ridiculously overpriced and not worth it.  The servers are so friendly though and they do take reservations and are able to accommodate larger groups so that is a plus."}
{"text":"Wanted to find somewhere in Toronto with a tasting menu, and found this little gem.  Chose the \"let us cook for you\" at $45pp and got 5 delicious courses. Kung pow cauliflower and the flaming chorizo was a hit, and the beef tar tar melted in your mouth.  Every item they brought out they explained incredibly well, and the service was top notch. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night for dinner on the patio.   The food was amazing. I recommend ordering a few items from the menu to share, one from each of the sections. We ordered the Kung Pao Cauliflower (after raving reviews about this), the Beef Short Rib and the Albacore Tuna. The portions were enough for a light meal for two. My favourite was the tuna - it had the perfect mix of citrus flavours with the fresh tuna. We also decided to try the RhuBarbara Streisand (a mixed drink with rhubarb, lemon-thyme and soda), which was very refreshing. My only pointer is that some of the dishes are more expensive for the amount of food provided - for example the beef short rib was $24.  Note that the patio is very small - it fits at most 3-4 groups of two. There is however a lot more room on the inside for larger group seating. One good thing about the restaurant's vibe in general is that it is relatively quiet with not many patrons - this makes for a great place for conversing. I would definitely come back here in the future, hopefully to try the low tea menu on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service, great ambiance, not too crowded, and most importantly: both innovative and delicious with classy ingredients, and lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I wanted to give an update on my review from a few months back.   I was invited back to thoroughbred by the owner and last night I had a great time here. The service was excellent the food/ drinks were great and I would definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"A party of four of us visited for dinner on a Saturday night.   Overall, this restaurant is very good. The servers are welcoming and friendly and the atmosphere is great. The food and drinks are absolutely delicious.   Would I recommend this place to my own mother? Probably not.   The first reason is that the food took a really long time to arrive. My hat goes off to the restaurant who proactively apologized for the length of time and voluntarily compensated us.   The other reason is that the portions were about 20% too small. Just order an extra dish or two.   These things are not dealbreakers for me because the food and drinks are great, but to those who are hungry and are short of time, you are forewarned."}
{"text":"Thoroughbred is a hidden gem - in a little corner :) A hipster setting with hipster staff - the waiters working the day I visited the restaurant had really cool hair hahaha  For drinks: Beau's Lug Tread Lagered Ale  I'd recommend:  KUNG PAO CAULIFLOWER 3.5/5 Om nom! This is so good for appetizers - starts up a good appetite. Very tasty and something more on the healthy end before you order the meats.  CHICKEN SOIGNE 4.5/5 How'd they make the chicken so tender? Not dry at all - very juicy. It's wrapped up chicken breast with white meat on the outside, dark meat in the inside. It's a combination of organic chicken, foie gras and truffles. The sauce that comes with it is also very delicious..  Very filling but worth every meaty bite :D"}
{"text":"Great place for an after work dinner and catching up with friends. I love their \"high five\" menu - $5 for the small bites with great selection like the cheddar cornbread and the kung po cauliflower. The bah minh was ok, not super special. We ordered two large to share - the duck breast and the poached sea bass. The sea bass was very delicious, I really like the sauce - flavourful but not too rich. But I found the duck breast a bit too raw so it still had that fishy raw meat taste. May be better if it's cooked a bit more. The coconut cream pie was absolutely delicious! It looked very rich and sweet but it was not, it had a perfect balance on the sweetness and the creaminess. Service was good which made the overall experience very satisfying. Will definitely come back to try their other creations."}
{"text":"Love this cozy drinking spot in the heart of the entertainment district! The Shaolin ice tea is an interesting classic cocktail with a Chinese twist - reminds me of a really concentrated plum juice! Also had a apple cocktail with a freshly squeezed green apple juice. The bar is quiet and great for a date or catching up with friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Winterlicious menu. The lamb shoulder was very good, the short ribs were a little dry."}
{"text":"So went here the other night and I have to say ballsiest menu ever! But in a really great way. I was so surprised at how great the food was, going back bringing friends and their friends and who knows may just buy the place lol. Seriously eat here! Good ambience, great food"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for directing us to this fantastic spot in the heart of Toronto's entertainment district. Our meal, from drinks to dinner to dessert, was great. Made a reservation for 2 on a Thursday at 9 pm. The place is small and was full...I'm glad I made the reservation - even with it we were put at one of the two tall tables in the little bar area.  Drinks first. We started with the Green & Rye (aka alcoholic apple juice). Needless to say, it was delicious. It was in the easy drinking section of the menu and tasted like it contained very little booze, which was fine and expected. A small line at the bottom of the menu said to ask the server about mocktails...why not? She asked what flavors we like...went with Ginger and Tart. The bartender himself brought out his concoction, which was AMAZING. I appreciate thoughtfulness in drinks, and putting the bartender on the spot like this is about as thoughtful as it can get...all for only $6! It was cool to see that the bartender was proud of his drink (he should be!)...he asked about it again as we were leaving.  TIP:  Thursday is High 5 Day! A small tapas-style menu where everything costs only $5!  We ate the cornbread (serious about the jalapeño), cauliflower (perfect spice), broccoli falafel (with yogurt, dill, cucumber, and sprouts), and beef tartare. Everything was phenomenal, with the cauliflower and broccoli standing out. Glad we were able to try lots of taste portions instead of the full meals...go on Thursday!!!  Dessert was a chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream along with a Chai and a Malted London Fog. The London Fog was the best I've had...the malt flavor is modest, but makes the drink stand out compared to the many others that I've tried.  Downsides?  Loud, tightly packed (although I prefer small restaurants like this!), DJ was a bit odd for a spot like this during dinner hours...but no complaints anywhere near big enough to knock off a star."}
{"text":"Excellent service - original cuisine.  I had the Brussels Sprout Cesar which was really tasty and the Kung Pao Cauliflower which is big enough for a satisfying meal (for me, at least).  But most of the dishes are sized so you can share them which is recommended because there are lots of tasty items on the menu.  My server and the bartender were attentive, made excellent and thoughtful recommendations... It's right across from the Scotiabank Theater."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time today, and I'm floored. With its classy rustic modernity and its concise, focused menu, the place looks and fits the part of a Toronto-born favourite in the making.  Admittedly, the place is small, but the intimate setting and low ambient volume make it an ideal date or business spot, especially for lunch.  The food was excellent; both small shareables and proper mains can be found, as with meat and non-meat options. The Kung Pao Cauliflower is a clear winner and likely to become a signature treat.  Nicer still, a private chef's table and kitchen upstairs add a great allure for those in-the-know foodies with friends.  Easily one of my new go-tos."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday night,  and the temperature's perfect for a drink at a patio.  Scoured the streets for a gastropub and our feet brought us to an unassuming spot with a tiny patio. With the name Thoroughbred - I thought  it would be a carnivore's paradise.  I was mistaken, pleasantly at that.   This gem of a place features regular ingredients and turns them into stars in their own rights.  Take the lowly cauliflower,  it used to be just an add on to stews or stir-fries, but at Thoroughbred,  it was the creme Dela creme when transformed into Kung Pao Cauliflower.  The blend of cashews,  chilies and Cilantro proved to be a winning combination to warrant a box office hit.    The next was the Brussels sprouts Caesar salad. I wasn't a big fan of this veg,  but after last night,  I was converted.    We also ordered the albacore tuna tartare with asparagus. It was a very small serving for its price,  but the explosion of flavours,  I can be forgiving.   Last but not the least,  the Reuben sandwich -  pickled veal tongue with generous portions of sauerkraut and Gruyère cheese.  The crunchy toast with the juicy tongue I'm in tongue high.   With decent options for craft beers and a subtle hipster vibe,  I wouldn't be surprised if this place becomes Toronto's fave hangout place.    And did I mention service was superb?"}
{"text":"Solid place! Came for some light food and a drink and it was great! Sat at the bar and had great conversations with the bartender, Julian! I ordered the Beef Tartare and it was real good. Came with cracker bread and I almost ran out with some beef still left and they actually got me a couple more pieces to help me finish off the beef! It was great! Great service and great food! Would definitely visit more if I lived in town!"}
{"text":"We randomly wanted to try something new and ran into Thoroughbred. The food is amazing and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on the last day of Winterlicious. The service was above average and the presentation was excellent. We started with the soup and salad. Then had the poultry and steak for mains. The reason this restaurant gets 3 stars: even though we were only 2 people, because we did Winterlicious (as opposed to their regular menu), we were charged an automatic 18% gratuity.  That was an awful move by the restaurant. As well, that gratuity was charged on the gross, not net amount.   We will never return and urge you not to as well."}
{"text":"The burger is on my shortlist for best in the city; nothing fancy, just well-executed and delicious. My friend had the Kung Pao Cauliflower which, to be honest, I wish I'd ordered instead. he favoured me with a forkful and it was incredible. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came as a group for a birthday and all had a pleasant experience at Thoroughbred.   The service was impeccable, fast, courteous and just the right amount of small talk with the table from the server. Food came out reasonably fast, and everyone said great things about their dishes (our table had the butternut squash lasagna, pork belly spagehtti, dry-aged sirloin, albacore tuna, octopus, quinoa beet salad and a few oysters to share and some usual drinks). Everything was delicious and delicately cooked. However, to the cook's own admittance, they could have given us more pork belly spaghetti (which they voluntarily provided more for the boys at the table, which was very nice). My only criticism is that the main's are in my opinion, tapas, but well worth the price considering the quality of the food.   Like the previous reviews suggested, it is a hidden spot with little signage outside, so you really need to look out for it. It's not a place where you go and stuff your months out, but it is a fun spot to go and share a few tapas with friends with drinks. Our group was pleasantly surprised and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed by this place. The decor was suitable for a small dinner group (no more than four people). The service was pretty good as well.   We order the following:  Brussels Sprout Caesar Smoked Egg | Brioche | Manchego  - I could not try this dish due to an allergy, but my dinner companion was quite pleased with it.   Pork Belly Spaghetti Squash | Apple | Pickled Ginger  - This was not bad, I would like to have had it a bit more crispy, but the Squash was the highlight in this dish  Octopus Carrots| Sumac Yogurt | Pumpkin Seeds - This was just ok - I have had far better in many other places - would not recommend if you order octopus on a regular basis  I wouldn't make a concerted effort to return to Thoroughbred any time soon, but at the same time I wouldn't be upset should I eat there again..."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Thoroughbred with some friends - decided to try it because of the good reviews and because I walk past it almost daily on my way to and from work.  It's kind of tucked away but we thought it was a gem.  The staff are friendly, the service is efficient, the food was really great and they even had a wine special - Riesling for $6 a glass!  Three people had steak and two had the branzino and we all really enjoyed our meals.  We also liked the vibe - lots of wood and exposed brick, good music and the noise level was reasonable so we were able to have a conversation - I will definitely return.  A really great dining experience."}
{"text":"*Summerlicious 2015 dinner  -Chicken Liver Mousse:  The best dish I ate there. The mousse had a smooth consistency that was in perfect contrast with the heavy and rustic spiced carrot bread. Since the chicken liver mousse can be a bit rich, the huckleberries gave a hint of acidity and sweetness to help cut out the fat. However my only \"oh no\" with this dish was how there should have been more pieces of bread, but I licked the plate clean and I would have gone back just for this dish.  -Kung Pao Cauliflower:  it really tasted like kung pao chicken! The cauliflower had a crisp exterior, not too saucy and had some crunchy texture with the cashews. I believe there was some acidity in the sauce, so the cauliflower was really easy to eat and prepare us for the next course.  -Mushroom Wellington:  The buttery and flaky puff pastry encased the beefy portobello mushroom, and it was seasoned well so I didn't miss the beef at all, this is a perfect dish for a vegetarian :)! The truffle enhanced the earthy flavor  of the mushroom and the tangy onion jam really helped to cut down the heaviness of the wellington.  -'Fish & Chips':  This is Thoroughbred's take on the typical fish and chips. The fish was an Ontario rainbow trout,  it was not pan fried nor deep fried so I think it was cooked with by sous-vide technique?  The fish had a soft and delicate texture, and the homemade chips were lightly salted, which went really well with the fish. With that said, I wish there would have been more pieces of potato chips though :(.  -Chocolate Hazelnut Tart:  To be honest I was quite disappointed when I realized that there was only half of the tart on the plate, I felt cheated lol. Luckily my friend was already quite full from her previous dishes, and the tart itself was quite heavy, so I can forgive that half-a-tart issue lol. The tart had a nice crust to fillings ratio. The filling was a semi-dark chocolate which didn't overpower the hazelnut taste. Overall the tart had a perfect level of chocolate flavor with a little sweetness!  -Buttermilk Pana Cotta:  I'm not sure what were they trying to do with the presentation! When the bowl arrived, the ice cream already melted, and the pana cotta had a really weird texture..... It was melting as well. The slightly sour rhubarb cut through the sweetness of the pana cotta, and you are getting some crunchy texture from that... triangle foamy thing lol...  It tasted like yogurt hahaha. I just though the portion was small and had a messy presentation, otherwise it was a pretty good dessert."}
{"text":"Crazy good place. We were a group of 5 and this is neither big nor small place. Loved the decor with string lights. The menu was simple & limited but every single thing was delicious. The chef made some special veg things for us. The drinks were great. Its not as expensive either. The best part was that the food was farm fresh! Crispy cauliflower and the brussels sprouts were my favourite. I'd go there anain the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"And they're off...  No mechanical bulls, country karaoke or horse tartare at this place.  Instead you get fresh, attractive and innovative bar food in a cozy yet funky setting. The owners are present and together with the waitstaff work hard to make your experience ideal.  There is a decent cocktail list and a handful of draught and bottled craft beer available.    At this time, the bar menu is surprisingly vegetable based but one can still indulge on hot dogs, burgers and sweetbreads and seafood snacks.  Personally, I had the olives (with slim jim and pepperoncini peppers), roasted broccoli marrow (a vegetarian version on bone marrow), the bloomin' scallion (a twist on the Outback's bloomin' onion) and the summer squash. Each was well balanced and visually appealing.         There are big plans for this place including a 35 seat dining room upstairs and a chef's table offering flexible and unique dining packages for 6-10 people.  This place can either have the success of Secretariat or the unfortunate fate of Barbaro but if the initial experience is an indication of what's to come, I'll place my wager on the former."}
{"text":"We just went for drinks and snacks on a Sat night.   The hostess asked if we had a reservation which we didn't but there was a table for four available (around 9:30 pm).   Large selection of gin, about 7-8, and they put sliced cucumber which is a delicious addition. Very refreshing. Hendricks & tonic was $9   Large selection of wine and beer.   I had a sweet tooth so I ordered the crême brûlée for $7. It was a non traditional take on crême brûlée in terms of flavour but was still enjoyable but not spectacular. It had a nice hardened sugar top as it should. It came in a small Mason jar and with long cute dessert spoons. Better than the crême brûlée were the oat and ginger bark/thin cookies that came with it. The ginger taste was very subtle.   My friend has the spicy cauliflower and she said it was crispy and sticky and spicy - delicious she said (see photo). She would order it again. Limited food menu and small portions but no different than other downtown hot spots.   Good music playing but hard to hear the person across from you.  Intimate lighting and nice simple but stylish decor.   From Thurs-Sun I suggest making a reservation especially if it's date night or a group of 4 or more.   Would I come back? Yes but not for dinner due to small portion size  Would I recommend it to others? Yes for drinks and snacks   One gin&tonic and the crême brûlée came to $20+ tip. Service was good!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! We loved our cocktails, truly delicious food, cozy atmosphere, and the waiters/bartenders were super nice and knowledgable."}
{"text":"came here on a tuesday night. Food was good - we ordered the kung pao cauliflower and the fried chicken and champagne special and both were good. I want to come back and try their brussels sprouts. The only really i'm giving this place a 4 star is because service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Been here twice and everything on the menu is delicious. The burgers are juicy and the cauliflower kung pao was amazing. I recommend everyone to try this place once, especially if they're looking for something new, because it probably was one of the best experiences I've had dining out. The service is always fast and friendly and the restaurant has great, warm vibes. Not the cheapest place but 100% worth it."}
{"text":"I came here thinking about the kung pao cauliflower but ended up getting the brussel sprouts caesar, which was superb. Loved the runny egg yolk that dressed the caramelized sprouts. The beef tongue reuben was so tender and flavorful. Unfortunately the bottom piece of bread was completely soggy, but the top was nicely crisp. I sat at the bar and the bartenders took great care of me."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.   Yelpers are absolutely right! The service was fantastic. The fact that they come over to pour your water for you every time you finish drinking yours.... Just so good!  I got the haute dog like everyone else here and it's such a big portion size that I couldn't finish everything. I still remember that flavor in my mouth... The mustard seeds and truffle oil. It was turning something so normal - like the regular Canadian hot dog that you find on any downtown street in Toronto- to something so luxurious and flavorful.   We were told that the sausages were made by hand behind those kitchen doors. :)   We also had the chicken pate to taste as an appetizer and that negative space look on the dish made it look so good. The raisins and the sauce on the side made the liver so flavorful that I forgot it was a pate.    Definitely want to come back and try their dinner menu as I only tried their lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing concept! My boyfriend and I came here after a show downtown on the weekend. We made the mistake of eating a bit before thinking we were only going to come here for some cocktails. Big mistake on our part because when we saw the \"let us cook for you\" on the bottom of the menu and heard about the amazing foods you can get for $45 $55 or $65 per person we wish we came starving! For sure coming back here to try the $65 per person \"let us cook for you!\" Experience.   The cocktails were so fresh and amazing! We got the Kung pow cauliflower which was so great! Perfect dish for two people to share. The tea smoked trout was my favourite, so many components on the plate and it tickles your palette in so many ways!   They were so nice also when the server made a mistake and didn't enter our made to order corn bread (which was the best I've ever had!) she offered us a complementary item as we had to wait for them to make the cornbread. She brought us some loaded potatoes which were good but nothing like the other items we had. She also took the cornbread charge off our bill. Such amazing service besides this little mix up.   To finish off you have to get the chocolate chip cookie! It is still soft, warm and doughy when it comes to the table! So amazing, which I ordered two! Lol"}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and go eat here. Now. Let the chef pick your food. Just trust.  Seriously, one of the best meals I've ever had. The oysters were fresh, the tuna had the most amazing texture, I would have cheerfully ordered the chicken liver mousse for 3 courses plus dessert if I could have.  Only teensy complaint was the drinks were a little small/sweet for the price, but hard to complain about that when the food is just so damn good."}
{"text":"I haven't given out a 5 star in a long time, and figure this place is as deserving as any.  For only being in business a few weeks, they have their act together. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and fast staff. Lot of food is made in house. Kung Pao Cauliflower and the Hot Dog are worth trying. The servers show that they really care that you have a great experience. My only possible critique would be to have a bit larger food portions for the price, but I have no basis for this other than my own gluttony."}
{"text":"Looking at the menu, I didn't think see anything that really stood out. But I think what won me over was the execution of their menu. I tried a few things on the menu (pancakes, quiche, huevos) and their flavour profile resonated with my palette. Everything was executed and presented in a thoughtful manner and flavours were bold and balanced but not overly salty or oily. The restaurant seemed very trendy, understated and not pretentious in any way. That also goes for the service. I did however try their veal tongue eggs benny and really was not a fan, but I think that was more a personal dislike and not something to fault the kitchen. Overall I had a good experience and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I saw all of these great reviews on yelp and decided to give the place a try, but was thoroughly disappointed. The food was just good, not bad, but not great. The portions though were very confusing. They're too big to be tapas style but too small to be a main for one person, so you're just left with a very awkward in-between. Not to mention, the dishes are priced as if they are mains but leave more to be desired.   The service was also just ok. Everything from ordering to getting our food was very slow. It is also very loud as our table was right by the speaker. We asked if the music could be turned down but were told that it couldn't, and we just had to shout at each other over dinner.   In summary, the small portions of food coupled with mediocre service was quite disappointing and very not worth it compared with what we paid. We all left hungry and ended the night at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Go for the Kung Pao Cauliflower. Stay for most of the other dishes; the unpretentious service; an excellent, offbeat wine list; and cozy, intimate atmosphere on the 2nd floor (or hopping bar on the 1st floor).  Don't be fooled by the location smack in the middle of a bunch of clubs - this is a hidden neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Great little place nestled inside a busy part of Richmond St with a cozy ambience and lighting to match.   Came here for my birthday with a large group of 13. The hostess was very accommodating to my large group size, which for the size of the restaurant was probably hard to manage. We elected for the $45 tasting menu after seeing some good reviews. Although they tell you there will be about 5 courses, I swear in the end we got to try around 8-9 unique dishes, which is an unusual but lovely surprise!  Notable ones include the Broccoli Falafels, Roasted Squash with Sweet Potato Hay, Kung Pao Cauliflower (although this came at the end when we were all full, so didn't get to enjoy it as much), and finally the pièce de resistance...Flamin' Pork Sausage served with creamy sauerkraut. This was a showstopper as it came in a ceramic pig head with an open flame that cooked the sausage right there on the table.  Service was excellent and as were the wine selection/drinks menu, although be prepared to easily spend $80-90pp with the tasting menu and drinks. A splurge in my books that will be reserved for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening (about 9pm), party of 2, post-dinner for drinks and snacks. It was pretty busy so we were seated at the communal table. There was a live DJ playing an awesome mix. The ambiance of the place is dark and music is relatively loud. We ordered cocktails and mine was a bit on the sweet side, I'll probably try something different next time but my friend enjoyed their drink. We also had the kung pao cauliflower that was surprisingly tasty. Who knew? We really liked it. Service is fast and friendly. I'll definitely be back to try some more of their food."}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted about this place. First, the service was very, very good. The waitress was friendly yet not intrusive. The inside is hipster-ish as most places are these days. Now the food... I liked the brussel sprout salad. It was a unique take on caesar salads and was pretty decent on top of that. On the other hand, I think I may be the only person on Yelp who does not like the Kung pao cauliflower that much. The flavour is right but too strong to eat an entire dish of. I really liked the chicken liver mousse though. That was probably the best dish of the night. I wish they gave more bread though to go with all that mousse. It seems a bit stingy of them to only give you 3 chunks of bread. Lastly, we also got the flaming sausage. It was good but not $26 good. It's one of those dishes that I feel I've made before at home. It does come flaming for about 15 seconds though and it's a nice presentation but kind of a gimmick.  Overall, I'd have given this place a 4/5 had we just ordered the chicken liver mousse and the brussel sprout caesar. But like any other tapas place, the misses shouldn't be as numerous as the hits."}
{"text":"Heard so many amazing thing about Thoroughbred Food &amp; Drink (@ThoroughbredTO) that I have no idea why it took me so long to pay them a visit.  Bought to us by Chef Ariel Coplan previously George &amp; Splendido which are two of my fav restaurants, I do have high expectations and let's just say I wasn't disappointed.  With a long bar thought the first floor of the narrow space with a DJ table at the end, we were quickly escorted upstairs to a more casual dinning area.  Burrata $13 ~ Ramps, Beets, Watermelon Radish ~ Delicious, refreshing and pretty, love the simplicity of the dish but wish there was a tad more of that burrata.   Kung Pao Cauliflower $11 ~ Cashews, Cilantro, Chili ~ Deep fried and coated with spicy sweet sauce topped with crunchy nuts, this was just simply AMAZING!!!  Mushroom Wellington $16 ~ Watercress, Portabella, Parmesan ~ The puff pastry made in house, it was a buttery flaky goodness and I didn't even miss the beef with the meaty portabella. ~ And I can't help but love the presentation here, it looks like a fallen log in the forest where you would sit and relax which tied it with the earthy mushroom taste of this dish.   Smoked Duck Breast $27 ~ Ginger, Creamed Cabbage, Tamarind ~ Love the very subtle of smokiness, perfectly cooked and so thinly slice; it was perfect. A little bit on the under seasoned side, wish there was a little bit more of the tamarind sauce.  Assador de Barro $25 ~ House Made Sausage Cooked Table Side ~ Don't you love the flaming piggy here, totally unnecessary but can't help but love this. The final moment on the flame helps to crisp up the casing. ~ Yes it's green because the sausage of the day have rapini in it, love the sausage with the perfect crisp casing but wish it came with a side of bread since it was rather salty and heavy on it's own.  I really really really wanted to try their Foie Gras Macchiato but they didn't have it that day; Foie Gras infused coffee who would want that. To compensate, I had one of their Jell-O shot which was amazing, tasty but strong.  Molotov Pudding $7 ~ Molotov Pudding is a tradition Portuguese egg white flan and it's the first time we had it. ~ I am usually not an almond flavor person but this wasn't \"fake\" tasting and the flan was so light. The pear slices also pairs surprisingly well with the almond flavor.  Chocolate Bar Truffles $2.50/ea ~ Ben couldn't resist getting the Reese Peanut Butter and the Coffee Crisp Truffles.  There have mostly Craft Beer here which is amazing since you all know that I am all about supporting local...  Woodhouse Brewing Co. Lager ~ A very easy drinking lager with smooth balanced and slightly sweet finish. This was perfect with the Kung Pao Cauliflower  Open kitchen on the second floor with a Chef's Table on the side that can easily host 10 people (this is definitely on my list for our next dinner party)  Verdict: ~ Love everything we had and can't wait to come back for more. ~ They just start serving Brunch, maybe we should come back for that. ~ They have a tasting menu call \"Let us Cook For You\", would definitely love to do that next time"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner while on a work trip and enjoyed it.   On Thursdays they have a \"high five\" menu of small plates. The menu is very small and there wasn't anything that caught my eye so I opted to go this route.   The oysters were meh. While they were very fresh, they doused them in this sauce that completely overwhelmed the briney flavor. It kind of defeats the purpose of eating an oyster. I also was unimpressed with the chicharron. They tasted like you could have gotten them at the supermarket, but with some cool sauces layered on top.  I did love the steak tartare and the kung pao cauliflower. Both were delicious and definite highlights of the menu.   I suspect they're more of a cocktail bar than wine or beer. There were only 3 options for red wine by the glass which was very underwhelming. I did enjoy the glass I had, but it would have been nice to have a better selection."}
{"text":"I'm a European who has lived in the U.S. for two years. Our trip to Canada gave us our best dining experience in North America so far (topping two Michelin restaurants in NYC). For a mere $45, we got a five-course set menu (plus fabulous oysters as an appetizer), and all courses were outstanding. Among the more unexpected dishes were the Kung Pao cauliflower, which was really tasty. The tartar was to die for. Dessert was a nice banana-meringue course with a curiously bubbly strawberry/rhubarb cocktail.  And don't miss the cocktail menu! I had a Red wedding.  Service was impeccable - attentive and knowledgeable, but never too persistent. It did however seem like a surprisingly small number of guests there for a Saturday night - probably people are enjoying the patios of other restaurants in the nice August weather.  If you are in Toronto and want something slightly more expensive and unusual than the ordinary, do go to Thoroughbred Food & Drink, I cannot stress this highly enough!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late night drink after having dinner with clients. It may not look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you. Their house cocktails menu is very interesting, and better yet, very enjoyable. I didn't try any of the food so this review is purely based on the cocktails. Service was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. If you're in the area, make sure you stop by."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem!!  The hipsterish staff are very friendly!! The location is super convenient!! The menu is quite small with few selections, but everything was spectacular!! We ordered the chef's menu and enjoyed some really interesting dishes :)  My fav: chicken with liver!!  My absolute fav: peanut butter hot chocolate!!!!! A taste of divinity!!!! Must try, no joke!! You will not regret it"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time! The food here is very unique and different from other restaurants that serves Canadian cuisine.   Our server explained to us that there are 3 different tasting menus - $45, $55, and $65. But because we weren't too hungry, we decided to try the $45, which the server said consists of 4-5 dishes. However when our meal started, the food just kept coming! We ended up getting 10 dishes in total, including dessert. We were very surprised by this as we thought we were only going to have 4-5 dishes. We also thought maybe they made a mistake with our order and gave us the $65 tasting menu instead. But when the bill came, our whole meal only costed $45/person which was very well worth the money.   All the dishes tasted amazing (except for the Kung pao cauliflower which I wasn't too crazy about). Everything was plated very artistically and all the flavours in the dishes complimented each other very well. The highlight of the meal was definitely the chicken liver mousse with huckleberry - I highly recommend everyone to try this dish!   Overall I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was really good and each dish was brought to us in a timely manner. With $45, you will be extremely satisfied with the amount of food that you will get. I will definitely be back next time with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Hey Tiff, how was....  The Reason:  It's Friday, my best friend and I just arrived in Toronto, we're hungry and looking for a nice chill lounge to go hang out.  It's already Midnight so a lot of restaurants we heard about were closed. Since we were only in Toronto for a weekend, we needed hit the ground running.  My BFF heard about a new spot that just opened and they served food late.  Perfect, here we go Toronto!    The Scene:   Small bar/lounge but very cool inside.  Low-key, hipster spot - perfect to kick-off your evening.  You walk up the stairs to enter the bar.  The bar is straight ahead.   The Playlist: Lounge music, Friday night DJ was good  The Drinks:  Great crafted cocktails  The Food:  Unfortunately, the kitchen was closed once we arrived...sigh     The Service:  The bartenders were friendly and security was very nice.  Shout out to Anthony.
