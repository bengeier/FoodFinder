{"text":"My wife and I ate here today.  It is located between the Food Lion and Anthony's Caribbean cafe (don't tell Anthony we went here though as we are regulars at his place ).

The place is really nice, although I thought the entry way was a little odd, 2 doors, one says use the other one and when you walk in you're in the middle of the restaurant and there is just a podium there.  You really don't know whether to just sit or wait, easily overlooked though.

They are offering free drinks for new customers (non-alcoholic) so we got a perrier and an unsweetened tea , which was green, nice.  The server was friendly and informative and not too overbearing.  The place was really quiet for a lunch time visit so I hope they pick up soon.

We ordered a 9oz portion of steak and chicken, a spicy tuna roll and the onion soup.  All was good.  The soup needed a little bit extra seasoning and I thought the chicken could have been a little bit juicier but overall it was good and we will go back.  Lots of things to try on the menu too.  I'm glad they are here, it is just around the corner from our house so it is nice to have another local option that serves beer and wine along with food.

{"text":"This is my second time here, both times have been enjoyable. Food is fresh, place is clean. Pretty good lunch specials. And yes, Fried squid legs."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The price is absolutely affordable and the food is incredibly delicious. I usually call to order and pick up some take-out to bring home for me and my husband. This place is truly a hole in the wall, as it isn't super popular. But it is very delicious and quality. I hope it gets the attention that is deservingly needs! 
I highly recommend Mai for any casual cravings of Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple chicken Hibachi. They tell me 15 mins. I go there exactly 15 minutes and 30 mins later im still waiting for my food. Why would I want to come here when I can go to Tanakas and getter better service. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious and always fresh, and service is always friendly! Atmosphere could be a little warmer (maybe dim the lights a little), which is the only reason why I dinged it a star, but it is still pretty and always clean."}
{"text":"Great food every time! We always get take out so I can't comment on the wait service but our food is always packaged well, tasty and generously portioned for the price. My favorite is the salmon hibachi!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my trusty Yelp app, I discovered this sushi place because it was nearby. I'm always driving through this shopping plaza on my way to the ABC store. I wouldn't have noticed this new restaurant because of liquor store tunnel vision. 

I'm a sushi novice, only willing to try any roll with shrimp or crab, preferably both. I scanned the menu and a few ones jumped out at me. So far in Charlotte I've eaten at 3 sushi places, with Ru-Sans holding the top spot (I'm temporarily the Duchess at this time *brags*) but being that I live in University, I'm not always motivated to drive out to Dilworth. So I decide to find a sushi place in my neighborhood.

I ordered the shrimp lovers roll and an order of shrimp fried rice. My food came out faster than I had expected, but there were only 4 other patrons that were dining in, I was getting takeout. I got home, took a bite of the shrimp lover roll and was very happy. The fried rice was alright, completely overshadowed by the sushi. I will return and try other options on their menu."}
