{"text":"Food was fantastic! The waitress was not informed of the menu and wasn't able to give any suggestions.. Overall fun time!"}
{"text":"I went here expecting to eat sushi, and ended up ordering other items on the menu. While their sushi menu wasn't extensive (at least for dinner), they did have quite a few creative dishes. I tried the cod which was in a cinnamon sauce and the take on a thai beef salad. Both of which I really enjoyed. The cinnamon sauce on the cod was awesome and it was a perfect dish for something light. The beef was marinated in a thai lime sauce and cooked perfectly. The crab cakes were ok. Not the best I've had.  The chef was very down to earth and cool. He stopped by our table to ask how we were enjoying the food.  The biggest downside I would say was the service. Our waitress was slow, and it wasn't busy. She told us they were out of mussels, and we found out later that they were not."}
{"text":"Meh. I'm really surprised this place has such positive reviews. It wasn't terrible but also nothing to write home about. Our waitress also wasn't informed of the beer list, specials, or most things on the menu, but it was her 2nd day so I'll give her a pass. That's to be expected with a new/reopened restaurant. Mostly, the food just wasn't that great. The drinks were okay, but the coconut mojito (which I'd heard good things about) was overly sweet and also TINY (maybe 3 oz total? or less?). Not great for $6. I realize mojitos are supposed to be sweet but with the addition of coconut it seems reasonable to cut down on the sugar?   We got the tempura shrimp, which was pretty good and the corn cakes (pretty tasty but also weirdly spongey and greasy) for appetizers. My husband got a volcano roll, and said the avocado was too hard and the rice was too soft. I got the crab glass noodle salad, which tasted fresh and was decent, though the serrano peppers made it super spicy. I like spicy food, and put hot sauce on most things, so I could handle it, but most people (even those who don't mind spice) probably would find it too much.   The space is really nice, especially the lounge area by near the bathrooms, so this place has potential. I also think to really compete with other, better options, they will need to get some draft beer."}
{"text":"We stopped in to this reopened space for sushi and sashimi.  The revamped menu is much more infusion than we expected so we opted for some sushi rolls (Spider and spicy tuna) and were completely impressed.  We sat outside and enjoyed delicious cocktails as we waited (the coconut mojito was awesome!). The service was attentive and friendly.  Over dinner we talked about the positive addition of a more 'asian infused' place on state street given that there are very well established sushi restaurants within a few buildings.  We will be back to explore the menu some more! Cheers."}
{"text":"Pros:  1. We had the crab cakes, cod, and beef salad, and all were AWESOME!! 2. The head chef personally came to our table and asked how everything was. I thought this was a great gesture, and significantly improved our experience. 3. The atmosphere and design was really tasteful, with an open kitchen (can't hide any secrets back there!), unenclosed bar area (or there!), and ample room in between the tables.  Cons:  1. Our wine was $9 a glass...the glasses were pretty full, but that price for a glass of wine is comparable to what I was paying in Chicago...not sure if that's going to fly in good ole' Madison, WI. 2. The service was pretty lacking, unfortunately. I'm a server myself, so I understand the challenges and pitfalls, but these mistakes were significant enough to damper our otherwise great experience. We wanted to order the mussels, but were told by our server that they were out of those. Okay, fine. But when the head chef came to our table, he RAVED about how delicious the mussels are, and when we told them we wanted them but they were out, he told us that they were not in fact out of mussels, and that he had just gotten in a 10 pound order! Aside from that, we went through most of the meal without our server checking back on our table.  HOWEVER, our server was very nice and polite, and I think these minor kinks could be ironed out as the restaurant gains experience.   Overall, a good meal! Will be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks on the patio and ended up having food as well. My super fruit mojito was exceptional and the beer selection was great. Our server was very nice and attentive and we even met the Chef, who was also very nice. We had a sushi roll, I can't remember which one, but it was so good. We also had the corn cakes and crab cakes. Both were very good. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I had a very unfortunate experience at T-Sushi's reincarnation, \"Chi\", and as a previous reviewer mentioned, it is surprising there are so many positive reviews. In fact, I implore you to look at the large number of filtered reviews, all of which appear to be friends of the owner. In an attempt to remain fair and balanced, which are my standards as a journalist outside of \"Yelp\", I would like to start by saying this place is, indeed, better than its predecessor. However, it is still not up to par with the many other well-established, and respected sushi places in the Isthmus area. T Sushi was very unorganized, and now Chi does appear to have a sense of direction under its new owner. However, some things remain unchanged. The restaurant tries hard to be \"trendy\", although comes off as having a \"faux-trendy\" or snobby ambiance. I do wish that they had spent more money on the decor, which at first look appears high quality, but upon further inspection, is far from it. Furthermore, the wait times are quite unacceptable, and the staff turn-over rate appears to be unusually high, because I have dined here on 3 separate occasions, and each time, was served by a brand-new waitress. When I inquired about one particular person who I really liked, they said they no longer worked there. All in all, the food was OK, but no where near as good as Red, or Muramoto. While this location now appears to at least be safe, unlike T Sushi, which had many complaints of unscrupulous activity on the part of \"T\", it will most likely be a very long time until they become world-class, or at least on the same level as their competitors. Madison is watching, and waiting for the verdict, but for Chi, it may come too late for them to reach a level of relevancy."}
{"text":"I did not eat there, this review is for the bar and ambiance.  Bartender was EXCELLENT. While my partner's drink was simple to order (though a lot of work to make! some sweet martini with many dessert-like ingredients!), my own drink I am particular about. However, the bartender did an outstanding job and made an excellent martini just as I wanted it to be, asking questions occasionally to be sure he was making it as I wanted. He knew he had a finicky martini drinker on his hands and instead of being lazy or unconcerned, he was over the top perfect. Very well chilled glasses too, bravo!  Unfortunately, while the decor is very nice (hipster & classy both), the AC was super weak and it was a summer day. Ug! I was very disappointed to walk into an upscale establishment on a hot day and it was not much cooler inside than out! We were told they were having problems with the heating/cooling system and could not afford a new unit. :( Minus two stars for this, it was HOT in there!"}
