{"text":"originally tried the chamango at first friday this month and fell in love! the staff is also very friendly. went to their store today because i wanted more!!! will be coming back on my next visit to vegas! wish they had this in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"this place is waaaaay over price! on the menu has one price but they charge you a lot more!  2 tostilocos, 1 agua and 1 chamango and they charge me $30!! ($29.39)"}
{"text":"So I came in last week and I bought raspados and they over charged me by like $3. When I tried to get extra syrup, on the menu it said 50 cents but she charged me $1 and I confronted her polity and she started getting really disrespectful. And she put her hand in my face. Would not recommend rude service."}
{"text":"The corn is so soft and sweet, really good. The chamango is really good but it would taste even better in mango season. The food did not disappoint. Just what we were looking for. There are so many things to choose from."}
{"text":"Will never come back. Usually come here with my gf couple times a week.  This time the lady didn't ring me up right. Other lady came up to me after I sat down to say she didn't charge me for items and wanted me to pay. So no problem. I went to pay. This time they charged me too much.  So I went back to the register to tell them.  The first lady said she didn't know how to fix it and the other said the same and also that she wasn't sure of the prices.  Then they came and said they would figure it out. Only to ignore me till I was about to leave. Then they finally offered me something for \"free\". Even though I've actually already overpaid.  Say it again. Will never come back."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE! Food delicious and authentic!! Love it :) We will definitely be back often and will tell our friends.  Recommend the Tosti-elote and the Elote Entero."}
{"text":"This is my favorite snack place I love their tostielote was amazing! Fruit crepes are the best!! Great costumer service ! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Clean place, lots of healthy and delicious choices! They have anything from a super healthy fresh fruit juice all the way to ice cream and crepes. You must try this place...such a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came to this place to check out the tostilocos. The service was good and helped me out pretty fast wasn't too busy. I got the tostilocos and agua de sandia. The tostilocos were good, the cueritos were easy to eat and they serve it on a plate which makes it nice for a quick little date with your gf. The agua de sandia was good just make sure to ask for less ice to get more juice. Overall the place was good."}
{"text":"This place does not know how to make a chamango! I was so excited to try this place but left disappointed. Mango chunks are hard and green, they added like a spoon of ice cream which chamangos require more ice cream. All I got was a cup full of mango chunks. With no flavor. Could give it 0 starts if it let me."}
{"text":"I always forget to take a picture. My daughter and I ordered a strawberry and banana crepe with Nutella. It was big and came with a scoop of ice cream. Very yummy. The place is clean, the employees are nice and helpful, and they have a large menu. Highly recommend if you like Mexican snacks!"}
{"text":"First time at chamango and it wasn't too bad. They offer two sizes, a medium or large. I got the large. They give you huge slices of mango(wish they cut it  a little smaller to eat easier) and mango sherbet. I wish it was more like a smoothie type because there was some empty spots in the cup that the smoothie would fill. Also not enough sherbet in the cup. Last week I tried a Chamango at the swapmeet on pecos and Las Vegas boulevard. They make a mango smoothie and also have diced fresh mango in the drink with a whole lot of chamoy and candy. Definitely give the swap meet a try. very delicious. I give chamango a 3 star for their service. It was quick.although the chamoy was very sour."}
{"text":"Cute little shop. Has a lot of options for desserts, but I prefer the flavors of another place down the street. The chamango did not have enough flavor to it. Needed more of the spices and seasonings. The pepino drink was too sweet. The service is really nice here though, as they serve you at the table."}
{"text":"Great selection of snacks from elote to aguas frescas. Husband and I got elote en vaso, coco agua, a mango raspado and choco bananas. All were delicious.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It's the second time I come here , the ice cream it's delicious and the Crepes they are the best in all Las Vegas !! I love the energy at this place the staff it's maxing always with smile and very attentive.Amazing costumer service   Es la segunda vez k vengo a este sitio , la nieve es deliciosa e los Crepes si duda son los mejores k eh probado en toda Las Vegas  !! Me encanta la energía de este lugar el personal es muy atento ,siempre con sonrisa amable e sin duda unas muchachas muy guapas!!"}
{"text":"Love the menu choices, I tried the aguas frescas and they are so refreshing and delicious. The Chamango  is my favorite. Very clean and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! I had a raspado de vanilla and a corn on a cup my friends had elote and tostilocos all of us were VERY satisfied"}
{"text":"The best snacks ever, I mean not just that but the service is amazing catering to our every need and making sure we where comfortable even with our 10 month old 2 year old and 5 year old, we had corn on the cob ice cream and crepe delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here one day while in the area for a quick snack. Had found this place by chance on yelp or something recently and decided to try it.   A few people sitting down at the tables but doors were open for some \"Fresh\" air but it was kind of hot inside.   On the menu, it says Chamango is $5.95 without any signs for size. When i had ordered, the guy asked if i wanted a small or large, large being the more popular one. So i opt'ed for a large, thinking it was like 1 or 2 dollars more. The total ended up at $10.35. WTCRAP !? Ok i know im not mexican nor do i know what im walking myself into but damn thats one hell of an upcharge o.o ! the picture looks like a large. When i got my order, large pieces of mango with 2 scoops of mango ice cream topped with a ton of the chamoy syrup. No not everything lightly covered... i literally had a measurable cup amount of chamoy syrup. The mango is unripe but crunchy. Not sure if thats the way they prefer it but its similar to what is preferred in viet dishes. The ice cream is a bit icy but was not overly sweet. Not sure if it was the chamoy syrup that screwed up my tastebuds lol... better to get 2 normal chamangos than 1 large probably.   unsure if id return in the future."}
{"text":"Great place friendly people the woman and her son her service me had the best customer I've ever experienced the food was great and you guys are open late !! Thanks so much it was so bomb !!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. The staff has excellent customer service skills. Very welcoming and friendly! Ordered ice cream, a raspado and popcorn. Everything was delicious and the popcorn was fresh my kids loved it. We will be back every time we come to the city.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Snacks are always bomb & customer service is superb! They have plenty of seating space, clean areas, a lot of snack options, music playing, TV, and they're open late hours! So if you get those late night munchies... come here!"}
{"text":"I love a variety of Mexican snacks but it seems like every time I visit one of these places I get looked at as if I shouldn't be in their store. That's the vibe I got when I went to this place too. Snack was still good though!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the esquite I ordered was actually CANNED corn (I'm still shook) which is not ok because I can get an esquite from my local elote man for like $2.  The people were very nice and the place itself is clean and welcoming. I'm sure this place has really good Mexican antojitos but I was not satisfied with what I ordered."}
{"text":"I love this place everything we got tasted amazing , their coconut ice cream is so delicious ! It was very fast and customer service was great . Definitely a great go to for something sweet ."}
{"text":"Came to this place after I went to the swap meet with my friends... not one table was clean no where to sit so I went to the cashier to see if someone can clean a table for us and she said she'll send someone right away. after waiting 15 minutes for a table finally someone came out to clean it with a very bad attitude...  everything is very over priced and not worth the pay the aguas frescas are not that great very blend taste... dirty tables dirty floors terrible service overall NEVER COMING BACK i don't recommend this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"The place is great and all. The food is delicious and well prepared. You have the option to eat at the location or take to go which is convenient. Only Issue is that the food is definitely overpriced. The quality they serve doesn't help how over priced this location is."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad to eat some raspados- limón & tamarindo. The custom service was great! Really nice girl & the raspados were great!! Perfect place for a treat!"}
{"text":"I got the corn on the cob with everything. It was fresh and delicious. Definitely better than the vendors in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food. Crepes are delicious. This place is very clean, spotless really. The staff is great, very friendly and courteous. We ordered the chamango, bionico, coconut, fruit crepe, savory crepe and the Mexican corn. They were all amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Try the tostielotes, you won't be disappointed! Chamango was exactly what I was craving. Also tried the Diablito, which was perfect. On top of the food being bomb, the service was great! The young boy who greeted us was one of the nicest little kids I've ever encountered. His mother, our server, was so sweet and helpful. Basically what I'm trying to say without sounding like a sappy twat, just try this place out. Fuh real!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fruit is always fresh. Ice cream so many to choose from. I love the fresh strawberry and horchata drinks. Service is always friendly. Great place to come on a date or bring the kids along. A million stars!!"}
{"text":"I decided to order some food via ubereats. We were watching the world cup games  and super excited to get our food. So, I discovered this restaurant and they have so many options buy my sister was craving something sweet so she decided to get one of the crepes. We chose the \"Crepe De-Light\" and \"Veggie Crepe\" We waited like 20 minutes for our food. I was super hungry and excited... Veggie Crepe was meh, a lot of spinach but nothing really amazing (no chipotle dressing as it says on the menu) . But the \"Crepe light???? Had nothing inside!!!!!! We were super upset. I made sure on my uber receipts that I asked for the right item and I did. So I decided to call them and tell them what was going on. The girl I think was trying to fix it. But I had to fix that with uber eats. By the time ubereats solved the problem I asked for a refund instead of replacing the food. You can not have this kind of problems. I basically had a tortilla instead of a crepe. We were super sad.  Definitely not a good experience. After going through this I just decided to eat whatever we had at home instead of.replacing."}
{"text":"Tostilocos, veggie crepe, chamango and the diabloito was the best here! It was my first time trying Mexican snacks and I'm so happy that I had a great experience! The staff is so awesome and friendly and helped me with all questions I had :) definitely my new go to Mexican snack place!"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. This place is great. Super clean. Super nice staff. Fresh fruit. Smells great. I love it. I got a chamango and it was amazing. It was my first time here and I will be back for the crepes, they smell so good."}
{"text":"Chamango never fails at chamango. Decent pricing for what they give you. Their ice cream smoothies are bomb!! Fresh fruit with every order and you can watch them make it!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Chamango was just out of curiosity and this has been one of the best finds yet. It was very clean and the staff were personable and patient because I had no clue what I wanted as everything looked tempting. You can find me here at least once a week maybe 3."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Chamango. This is the best Mexican Snack place ever. Do you guys ever plan to open one in Henderson? Very clean and excellent tasting food."}
{"text":"This place was horrible , got a Chamango and only had two baby scoops of ice cream and the worst part was that it was all mangoes. Normally I wouldn't complain about all the mangoes because I LOVE mangos . BUT in this case I was bothered by the fact that all the cut up mangoes werent ready to eat yet and they were hard . Didn't noticed it till I left because they were covered in chamoy . The worst part was that it was $6 for a cup full of hard/green mangoes . Better luck getting a Chamango from an Elotero and cheaper . ?"}
{"text":"I was very upset with this. I ordered a green juice and got this super thick can't even suck up the straw shit. Very upset because the lady at the register was so nice. Will never order a juice there again. The guy who made it seemed so unenergized and didn't even say enjoy or anything. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Bomb snacks!!! Very good customer service!! A great hang out spot!!! VEGAS YOUTHQUAKE in the house!!"}
{"text":"Best Snack's in Vegas ever! not only are the snacks made on the spot but this place is spotless clean. Ice Cream is home made, Tostielote is BOMB, Fruit Crepes are the BEST I've ever had! Costumer Service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything I order they didn't have . Like literally 4 things I asked for . I ended getting other items which where not good."}
{"text":"This place sucks ! Bad customer service , I order some chips with lemon once I tasted the chips it had a funny taste so I looked at the expiration date , they were from last year! Boo you guys suck"}
{"text":"They have a big menu, so It takes sometime to know what you want to order. The place is big and clean, I liked that. I ordered a chamango, tostiesquite and agua de tamarindo. Chamango It was ok, needs more flavor It's to sweet I was expecting more spicy, mango big chunks not my type We really enjoy tostiesquite but Is more esquite tan tostitos, you guys should have some salsa bar or something like that ñ. Agua de tamarindo just ok,  I was expecting more of this place 'cause we don't have good places here in vegas for enjoy this kind of snacks.  Service good, the girl she was nervous when we asked about the ingredients of the food."}
{"text":"Amazing and their customer service was the best! Very helpful and also very patient especially with my indecisive self and it doesn't help everything looked so wonderful"}
{"text":"Pretty bad place , went there and there was almost no ice cream available or fresh fruit waters  I bought a rice pudding cup and it was awful, very hard and tasteless Better going off the the Michoacána way better sweet treats and only 2 min away from here"}
{"text":"Hadn't had fresh fruit in condensed milk since moving out of state. I found this place on yelp and traveled off the highway to get my fix. It disappoint! We enjoyed a mixture of strawberries, cantaloupe, bananas, papaya, mango! So good!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite to get Mexican street snacks. They moved their location from Decatur and Twain. The ladies here are very nice and if your not sure on what to get just ask them they are more than happy to give you samples. My go to is the eltoes with everything. And the chmango."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio y muy sabrosos y nutritivos sus jugos y licuados 100% recomendable,"}
{"text":"Really great Elotes and great customer service. The atmosphere was really fun, upbeat music playing and I came in on a Friday night so it was pretty busy. The girl who helped me was very helpful. Very clean as well! Oh and I didn't see any issue with the price. They have tablets at the register that's itemized so if you have an issue paying an amount you can address it before they even start your order. My elote was $2.50 just as it was listed on the menu."}
{"text":"I wish I had a picture to show but unfortunately I didn't ever get my raspados. Waited 20 minutes only to find that my order had never made it on their outdated point-of-sale system (which only consisted of sticking a paper order receipt to a metal hook). Once she realized the mistake, the cashier (Adriana) simply told the kitchen employee to round up my two raspados and offered no apology. I requested my money back because I had groceries in my car and at this point was tired of waiting. The employee processed a refund but offered not compensation for my time. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Really nice place, has a ton of variety and options. The prices are great for what you get. 10/10 recommend the elotes are so good. Also it's a plus that everything comes out on nice plates."}
{"text":"Omg I searched everywhere to find elote. Im in love with this place . Im so glad i found this place thanks to yelp"}
{"text":"What a deception... decided to give this place a try... NEVER coming again!!! Ordered the so called tosti-locos....gross! Not worth the $6 FLOR DE MICHOACÁN.. all day everyday."}
{"text":"I tried the elotes in the cup. Grande. It was the best I ever had. I put hot cheetahs in mines for the first time and the crunch along with the corn was a big addition."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Pretty clean.good customer service. Should offer a stamp card for a free item considering you end up buying more items than what you initially come for."}
{"text":"A great place to satisfy your sweet tooth or fruit craving. They also have crepes which are delicious and different items as well. All the employees are always nice. I always stop by when I'm on that side of town. I'm sure they are busy on the days the Broadacres outdoor swap meet is open.   The building used to be an old Taco Bell but I prefer Chamango."}
{"text":"Close to an hour for a crepe. Unacceptable. The place wasn't even that busy. Lets get into the quality... never in my life have I seen a runny watery crepe. According to the time issue, the person at the counter stated they messed up or ripped the crepe so they did it over which still shouldnt take an hr! I will not be back. At almost $9 I can tale my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The manager here is so sweet along with everyone else. Very hardworking and their food is WOW. 11/10 would recommend. Very professional, they welcome you when you come in and say goodbye as everyone walks out. I loved the atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"it was okay. they messed up my order but i would go again if given the chance. the staff is very friendly and that is always appreciated"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found a place that sells Mexican snacks and is close to home! The place is clean and the workers are very kind."}
{"text":"First time ever here and i was so dissapointed at the fact that . I ordered a corn and from what i remember a corn comes with butter, mayo, cheese and chili powder chili.. well i told her everything on it i was so hungry that i took a bite right away and then i tasted everything including valentina hot sauce.. i toook 1 bite ONLY .. so i told the cashier and she said in a rude sarcastic way oh well you bit it already... wooow never has any business treated me this way... instead of replacing it and keep me going back you lost me and my family as a customer instead of loosing a corn.. that's usually about .40cents.. i don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"So, I haven't written a report for awhile now but I want to write something about this place it's my \"go-to\" spot for Mexican style Elote. Well, if yoiu been to TJ and hit up street vendor for their succulent Mexican style seasoned up buttery, cheesy, and them wonderful fixing... Well this place is where you get your fixed. It may be a drive for the people who lived far southwest of Las Vegas, but would it be worth the drive to satisfy those taste buds of yours... heck yah! You just need to hop in that car of yours and just do it. And guess what... it taste even better after gym time. So stop by and do yourself a favor and try it out yourself."}
{"text":"I found a place that sells gaspachos y vasolotes, this place was awesome,  really good service, great selection of snacks, clean establishment and delicious food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing ! Great service , great prices and yummy snacks . Also very clean and the staff is super welcoming !"}
{"text":"first time yesterday, and service was good, i heard of this place and wanted to try it out, took my manager and coworker and once we saw the menu we just went all out, grabbed a lil bit of everything and was delicious, would definitely go again"}
{"text":"I grew up on Mexican desserts and this place is awesome. Everything here taste amazing. I love the original chamango and elote and coconut ice cream. I recommend all those choices"}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a mango raspado and it was gross! As if the syrup had expired. I told the cashier and she told me she had to call her manager to see if she could give me a refund or replace it. I left the raspado on a table and walked out. Horrible customer service and horrible raspado!"}
{"text":"Nunca me gusta quejarme de un lugar que visitó tan frecuente. Pero cuando se tardan 30 minutos en hacer unas crepes es cuando no me puedo quedar callado. Llego gente después que yo y sus platos fueron preparados más rápidos y primero a los míos. Y cuando me acerqué a preguntar porque me dicen que las trabajadoras no saben hacer las crepes. Entonces porque no empezármelas a hacer tú y que otra tomen órdenes. No es justo que otros lleguen después y ya estén comiendo y yo espere y espere. No estoy feliz y no vuelvo a venir."}
{"text":"Great for Mexican Snacks, if I Knew about this place I would have came sooner, I was driving to the post office when I saw it. It stands out from the outside. The corn in a cup was delightful, when they say all ingredients ask what it has inside to meet your dietary preferences. I got the large cup and it was fulfilling. Next time I will go for a medium. They are nice, they speak Spanish and English. Professional and quiet ambiance."}
