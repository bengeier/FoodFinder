{"text":"This is my absolute favorite food truck. The pork belly adobo is awesome. Any time I see they will be attending any sort of food truck event, I'm there! The only downside is they seem to rarely attend events anymore. Please come back!"}
{"text":"Glad someone thought of Filipino infused cuisine! Worth the price and the egg roll add on"}
{"text":"OMG love this food truck!!!  I could eat this for lunch and dinner everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome fried rice! We had the shrimp and kimchi- both are amazing and not over salty like many restaurants do. Highly recommend and can't wait for them to come back to Lake Pleasant!"}
{"text":"Found this food truck at Phoenix Chinese Week.  Got myself a bowl of Yang Chow Fried Rice which included sausage, chicken, veggies and eggs for $8.  Tasty bowl, decent portion.  They also had a number of steamed bun dishes and other rice bowl choices.  The food is not Chinese in the strictest sense, but a very decent mix of Asian themed flavors and ingredients.  Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"The fams and I went to the Asian festival a couple weekends ago and had the crispy adobo fried rice.  Errrmagherd so yummy. Get it. Hope to try everything else on the menu because it all sounded good!!!

Look for the big black truck with splashes of color :-)"}
{"text":"5 star dining from a truck!

Attended the 22nd Asian Festival in Scottsdale this morning and found multiple food trucks and white food tents to dine from. I chose Flippin Rice, first impressed with their huge black truck and their colorful menu. I ordered #7 which consisted of 4 shrimp and pork lumpia with white rice, dipping sauce, and shredded salad and I added an extra (only $1 each) two lumpia to it, spent only nine bucks. Wonderful flavor and visual presentation made you want to eat more than you could! I will look them up in Gilbert one of these days."}
{"text":"Oh em gee this rice is full of flavor! I'm visiting from out of town and my sister told me she was grabbing dinner from here on her way home. Fried rice is always a guilty pleasure, so of course I couldn't resist. I ordered the chicken yang chow fried rice. The rice had so much flavor between the chicken, Chinese sausage and veggies - not too salty. The rice wasn't too mushy nor too oily either. It's a pretty big (single) serving, so I made it into two meals. They offer gluten free and vegan options too so everyone can find something yummy to try. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Yang Chow Fried Rice and the shrimp & pork Lumpia (their $1 deliciously meat-y spring roll add-on) are AMAZING! I hope they come back to our offices again, I would love to try some other menu items! Prices are great for the portion size."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Flippin' Rice for some time now and was finally able to. We went to the Food Truck Caravan a little while ago and enjoyed three items from Flippin' Rice.

My sister-in-law ordered fried rice with pork belly. The pork belly was super crisp and tasty. She really enjoyed the fried rice and I would definitely give it a try. 

I ordered both the adobo pao and the bulgogi pao to share with my husband. The adobo pao is crisp pork belly and the bulgogi pao is steak. Hands down, we both preferred the bulgogi poa. The steak itself was extremely tender and super tasty. The pork belly was good but the overall flavor just didn't compare to the steak. Both came with rice chips which were okay but completely unnecessary. While the pao was really delicious, I thought it was pretty pricey for just two buns and some rice chips. The fried rice was much more reasonably priced and a lot more food.

I'd definitely come back and try a few more items."}
{"text":"Great food. Great taste. Good size portions. Fair price. The Bulgolgi was fantastic as we're the Lumpia rolls and the fried rice!!"}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES! Flippin Rice is sooooo good! I wish they would come by my work more often. I would eat there everyday. Love the service and tasty food."}
{"text":"During the Chinese Culture and Cuisine Festival, we decided to eat at the food truck area and I noticed a food truck I've never seen before. This one focused on Asian fusion cuisine and from the looks on everyone elses's plate, the food looked pretty darn good. I went ahead and got the Adobo Fried Rice and some lumpia sticks.

The fried rice was amazing.

The components of this fried rice is that the brown rice was layered on top, then this light substance that reminds me of radishes, and then this devilishly good crispy roasted pork belly and garnished with a good dose of cilantro. As much as I liked the dish, the crispy fried pork bits were the star of the show. I applaud Flipping Rice for cooking this browned pork fat into a crispy-yet- not burnt masterpiece. It enhanced the flavor of the rice, which was browned with adobo, a generally savory yet subtly sweet sauce. 

The best bite I received from the fried rice was a chopstick full of rice, the radish stuff, the cilantro, and the pork. All of these flavors and textures really brought everything together. You have the freshness of the radish thing and the cilantro, and the savorieness and combination of textures of the rice and pork."}
{"text":"The food tastes great at this food truck. Very flavorful. I had the #1 which is the pork fried rice. I really like the sweet sauce it comes with. It is a little overpriced though. And the $1 add on egg roll is not worth it. The egg roll is tiny!"}
