{"text":"It smells and has cheap beer. Oh, and a trained pocket-picking canine. It's a classic Cleveland dive sans the hipsters."}
{"text":"Being from out of town I called to ask if I could smoke a cigar and have a drink...laws are different in each city. The lady answers the phone, I politely asked if cigar smoking was allowed in bars in Cleveland. Not only was she VERY RUDE but she was a smart ass, saying \"why did you call me? Go google it\" and huge up. They'll never get one penny from me. If the service is as bad as her attitude I'd  stay away. I'd give 0 stars if Yelp would let me."}
{"text":"The ugly broad is a relic. Old box tvs, John Wayne memorabilia, and the pungent smell of cigarettes. The bartender was friendly and seemed genuinely excited to have a non-regular in the bar. No beers on tap, bottles only and a limited selection. This is a CASH only bar too so be forewarned. The dog was super sweet but I think has a flea problem as I think I was bitten a minimum of 3 times while drinking my beer. The neighborhood isn't the greatest either so go with a friend and don't walk to your car alone. Friendly locals who love to talk politics. The broad is unique."}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 4-January-2017
Time of my visit: Mid-afternoon

So, my girlfriend and I wanted to try something local, something mom's and pop's type of place.  She found this joint with the help of Siri.

It was not too bad of the drive from our hotel, there were plenty of free parking, however, it turned out to be a bar, rather than a restaurant.  I should have double checked the Yelp! reviews prior to going, but I don't think it would have mattered as I had my mind set on wings.  It did look run down.

So, we arrived, took a seat, the barkeep came over right away.  She was very, very nice, professional and courteous, right from the start.  Excellent beginning!  We ordered waters and asked for the menus.  The menus looked abused, have not been reprinted since probably the day the place opened.

We ordered 12 wings each. I took traditional BBQ (drumsticks only), my girlfriend took boneless half garlic and half BBQ.  Two sides of steak fries and a salad.  Salad came out first and it was awesome!  The plate was large, had nice mix of vegies and was nicely chopped!  As we were consuming the salad, we overheard a very interesting conversation between the other 2 patrons in the establishment that were seating at the bar...  Let me put it this way, I don't believe I've heard the n-word dropped so many times in a single conversation or Jews from two white dudes...  Now, I will NEVER punish a business for a behavior of their patrons as I am a strong believer in freedom of speech, even hateful speech, simply because I would NEVER want my speech to be limited by anyone.  The best I can do is annotate it, let others decide whether or not they would want to come into this establishment and I'll decide with my wallet (ie if I would ever spend my money again at this place).

Side note: smoking at the bar area was permitted.  It is a cash only joint, there is an ATM on premise.

Our main food arrived.  Everything looked freshly made and delicious, however, the waitress made a mistake and made my girlfriend's wings all garlic, which was not a big deal to my girlfriend as we would have shared the wings anyway.  The fries tasted fresh and well fried (not over fried, just perfectly done).  The wings, probably, one of the best wings I have ever had.  They were perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried and just a right amount of BBQ sauce.  Total bill was under $20.

B+ experience!"}
{"text":"This is a real Cleveland neighborhood bar. The owner is warm and friendly, and the bar dog is a big old sweet rotweiler who does tricks for treats."}
{"text":"wow. I'm almost left speechless, but I have to spread the word.

came here on st patty's day. read the reviews, and it sounded like one of those places that i love exploring. it's like the trainwreck that you want to go see.

this place is all full of regulars. everyone was super friendly. they didn't get the memo here about the ban on smoking indoors, so that was happening. their beer selection, well, that's not what you go for. my friend had a bud light, that pretty much sounded like the best option. i had whiskey.
the owner of the bar bought me and my friend a round on the house. we went and said hi before we left. she's so nice.
oh the rottweiller! she's so adorable. she's old and limps and is the sweetest saddest old puppy you'll ever meet.

we had some fried foods. basically that's the menu. it was great tho. fried broccoli, friend okra, fried mushrooms. i'm not sure actually what they fried for us, presumably a number of different vegetables. there were mushrooms, that's the only one i'm sure of.

the guy and gal sitting next to us engaged us in friendly conversation, telling us about how they go there every day for years and what they do and the neighborhood.

all in all a good time. diviest of dives full of chain smoking regulars, fried foods, cheap beer, and friendly patrons from the neighborhood. our tab came out to something like 12 bucks. come here knowing what you'll get and you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing less than five stars, Sandy the barmaid she rocks, love this place, so like home, plus owner bought me a drink, if you miss this, you truly miss out.I tour for a living so getting out to have fun is important.this place will be on my map of return joints, Sandy is the best ever, she's cute too lol.shout out to her thanks your a rock star."}
{"text":"What a great fun, little local bar!  Debbie behind the bar was super nice and introduced us to the proprietor.  They have a daily dinner menu.  We ordered the Stromboli; it was perfect sized for sharing and really reasonably priced.  Regulars were nice, too!  Bought me and my better half a round - thanks Ronnie!  Btw, drinks are also reasonably priced.

A cute local joint that embraces neighborhood community by celebrating monthly potluck dinners, and free pool nights.

We will definitely return!   this place (despite the overwhelming cig smoke - suck it my California friends!)!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here on a Friday night based on Yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed. It was everything the other reviewers said it was. A dive bar, full of locals, a friendly barmaid, a good jukebox, a pool table, a friendly Rotty that we pet, cheap drinks, cigarette smoke (which was the only negative) and a super cool bar owner (Sherry). Right away the owner bought us a drink, welcomed us in and provided some funny conversations. Thanks for the good suggestion fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Just like the Toby Keith song says,,,,
I LOVE THIS BAR!'"}
{"text":"I smell of stale cigarettes and a giant dog, and I couldn't be happier. This place is as friendly as any bar I've ever wandered into. The booze is cheap and served with a smile. They have the world's sweetest rottweiler as a regular. It's places like this that make me love Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it. I love this place. It doesn't try to be \"politically correct\" or anything else for that matter but a bar. Period. 

The owner is super friendly and an angel. The rottweiler is so cute and sweet and greets people as they enter. If you visit, bring a treat for the puppy.

The patrons are decent, polite, kind, and courteous. It's easy to strike up conversation without much effort. 

Beer selection is what you'd expect as well as hard liquor. Don't think for a moment you're going to get 40 year old scotch in this place. Likewise, if smoking offends you then perhaps you'd be more at home at one of those \"chain\" bars."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland bar. It's got a pool table, a rottweiler, a country-music blaring jukebox, and regulars who didn't get the memo about the city-wide smoking ban... and I absolutely love it. 

The owner is a nice lady who sits at the bar and shoots the shit with you for a minute. The rottweiller, Shiloh, is the sweetest dog you'll ever meet. If you stick a dollar in your back pocket, she'll steal it and let you chase her around the pool table. [Shiloh's dollars end up in a donation jar to help fight breast cancer.]

Cleveland bars are generally cheap, but this one is ultra-cheap. Also it has inexpensive and amazing bar food. We always end up ordering mozzarella sticks in the \"keep 'em coming\" kind of way. 

Grab a game of pool or watch a game on one of the TVs.... Play around on the jukebox [which has non-country music too] and marvel at the John Wayne-themed bar [no joke]...All the while not breaking the bank. [$1 Genny cans are the real deal here]. 

I've gone here with just boys, mixed groups, and just my group of girlfriends and have always been please in every situations. No weirdos talk to you. It's just a bunch of locals trying to forget about the day and I'm happy to join them. 

It's such a great dive that even the Ugly Broad cartoon mascot [who is REALLY ugly] couldn't keep me away. Five stars!"}
