{"text":"The passion the owners have for good food is simply unmatched. Around lunch time on a sunday, the place was bustling with customers with nearly every seat full. Every dish brought out looked appetizing and smelled amazing. 

Though we knew no chinese and felt a little intimidated by no english menus, we worked up the courage to ask for their \"watermelon juice\". This drink was wonderfully refreshing while not being too, too sweet like many 'bubble tea' type smoothies. 
 
After running an errand, we decided to fill our bellies. The owner was sweet, courteous and explained the items on the menu to us with great enthusiasm. She said english translated menus were soon to come! The fish balls were light and tasty, their dumplings were absolutely heavenly and their 'heavenly chicken' was unlike any other dish I've tried; unique, and with a kick! 

We wish her the greatest success with this restaurant as we'll be returning hungry for more soon!"}

I'm Cantonese. I've had some Northern Chinese food, but I wouldn't say I'm particularly versed in it. My parents can read Chinese, so that does give me a slightly edge over those who can't read Chinese, but even then, some names are unfamiliar to us. My parents attempted to communicate in broken Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. The lady could understand a tiny bit of Cantonese and next to no English. This made things quite complicated. For English only speakers, you can still order, but point on the menu to what you want to order. After some effort on both sides, we ordered some items that were recommended to us for sharing.

We ordered steamed spareribs with rice flour ($6.50), special Sichuan house noodles ($6.00), and dumpling with special hot sauce ($6.50). 

We had no idea what rice flour meant when we ordered the spare ribs. We were thinking something noodle-esque. We were dead wrong. We received a small plate of cubed potatoes surrounded by spare rib bits (some with and some without bones), covered in what I'm guessing was a rice flour mixture. It looked like a pile of mush. Basically, that's what the mouth-feel of it was as well. The dish was tasty, and felt like it was spicy without actually being spicy. It was interesting, but for the price to portion, I would not order it again.

The dumplings with special hot sauce came 12 to an order. The wrappers are fairly thin and fairly large. The filling wasn't very big, but if they had been, they wouldn't have been able to pick up sauce the way they were made to. The hot sauce wasn't very hot. It was very fragrant and slightly sweet. Also garlicky. Mmmm. At $6.50, it isn't super expensive, but I wouldn't consider it a cheap eat either. I'm still thinking about whether the price is justifiable or not.

The noodles were my favorite dish of the night. We got ours slightly spicy (the other options being super spicy and not spicy). These noodles came in soup and had a small amount of minced pork, green onions, and fried soy beans (pretty sure that's what those were) on top. Oh. Also a bit of chili oil. The noodles were soft and had a nice chew. If what we understood was correct, they did not make these noodles in house. I greatly appreciated the additional texture the fried beans added to my noodles. Also chili oil, cuz chili oil, especially homemade, is one of my favorite condiments ever. For $6.00, this was a good portion, and I'd order these again.

We did hit a few service issues. This isn't really a sit-down restaurant. They have two tables for two and a bar counter that seats four. We were a party of three, so we sat at the bar counter. That was fine with us. The lady recommended that we share the dishes we got, but she did not give us bowls to share the food until we asked for them. If we were at a regular table, not having individual bowls would have been manageable, but how on earth were we expected to share a dish of pork ribs with the three of us sitting side by side? Yeah. That was issue one. I'm not sure if this second one was a cultural thing or not, but my mother asked for tea and the lady said they did not have tea, but did not offer us water or other drinks. Basically, it looks like if you don't pay for drinks, you don't get even water. They do expect tips. They bring food out to your table/counter, and they do wash the dishes after. However, if I don't even get water, tipping isn't going to go so well for them. When my mother thanked them for the tasty food (and she said it in those words, and in Mandarin that even I could understand), the lady just said \"Good\". They got less than 10% tip tonight.

If I'm in the area, I might stop by for the noodles again, but we'll see. There's plenty more restaurants to explore in the area!"}
{"text":"Too late to find this little restaurant! The owner is from Sichuan, same as where I am from. So guess I have the best judge for my hometown dishes. Honestly,this is absolutely the most authentic Sichuan restaurant I've ever visited! Everything is just the taste of my hometown!!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here today in the late afternoon for lunch. The owner recommended the dumplings in hot sauce and house special noodles (spicy), so I ordered both. These two dishes were amazingly good and spicy, but not too spicy that it's hard to eat - the dumplings were also spicy and a tad sweet. Still craving those dumplings. I will definitely come back to try the other dishes. Yum!"}

Usually you will find authentic street food in the World in the back alley where all the locals would love to eat. Wide Alley Kitchen wants to adapt the same concept and offers down to earth street food from Chongging.

Knowing a little bit of Chinese (staff speaks Mandarin and Cantonese, and their Cantonese is better than my Mandarin!) would help in the ordering process. The menu and everything are in Chinese only. 

Chongqing Noodle ($4.99)??????  extra spicy was really good. Spicy enough but not overwhelming. If you are a spicy lover, you would enjoy that. The staff was a little puzzled why I was brave enough to order extra spicy but I do know how hot I can handle.

Heavenly Chicken ($5.99)??? was a cold dish with shredded chicken in chili oil. This one was OK if you need a cold appetizer or some protein to go with your noodle. I order another bowl of noodle next time!

If you want to eat in, just beware that it is a really small restaurant that can only accommodate 10 people or so. 

I will be back more extra spicy noodle!"}
