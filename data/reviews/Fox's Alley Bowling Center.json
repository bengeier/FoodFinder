{"text":"We went here for the first time today and had the best time! You can tell the owners care about their business. It was VERY clean and well run. Staff was very friendly. They have a waitress that will bring you food/drinks/alcohol right to your lane, but they also have a snack bar and full bar. Outside is volleyball, which we'll check out next trip. It reminds me of the family owned one my family used to go to in Charlotte growing up. Just a clean, friendly, fun place to take your kids."}
{"text":"What a great time we had with our family Staff was great. A great time for all. There is a lot more here than just bowling  The bar the food and the outdoor patio make this a great experience. Mr Fox helped us get settled and showed great ownership. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Service was as good as it gets with ONE server I guess. Seriously what kind of place decides lets have one server and a bartender to run service all night long? Super nice girls running service! But, drowning is how I felt they were doing. Management seemed to not care clearly as they were sitting most of the time I was there. As a manager this infuriated me. Staff more people simple as that, and I would have rated yall better because my food and drinks were slow."}
{"text":"In the two times I've been, staff was very friendly. The pricing for food, drinks and to bowl are very affordable. I would highly recommend going there to bowl. Wouldn't change anything about this place."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place having good food. Dropped in with two friends for Thursday lunch . I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It was outstanding! My friends enjoyed their choices as well. They have several beers on tap also. I will definitely make this a regular stop."}
