{"text":"By far the best Mexican food ever!  I have been going to Valle Luna for over 20 years and they are always delicious!!  Service and food are definitely worth going back for."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a really good burrito in Arizona.  I went here because some friends recommended this place.   We ordered a Grilled Asada Burro Dinner.  We had the steak with rice and beans, but asked for it to be placed inside the burrito.   The person taking our order seemed confused, but did it for us anyway.  The burrito was really tasty.  The meat was very juicy and had the right amount of spices.  I would go back here to eat again, but for $15 for a burro, its quite expensive."}
{"text":"Went in got the border tacos and a bowl of red chili con carne........it came with a free piece of plastic in my border tacos. There's nothing better then paying 20 bucks for a meal that you have to worry about a chocking hazard in your food. way to go valle Luna  thank you for a wonderful/ horrifying experience with something that I loved. now, all I will ever think about is possibly chocking on plastic that's in my food because your cooks can't keep a clean organized work station....you also need a training course for your hostess in hospitality because it seems like I was bothering her asking her for stuff that I paid for, like my drink,napkin and plastic silverware but then again you gave me more plastic then I bargained for.   Thanks for a truly horrifying dining experience"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink and a cheese crisp, what a disappointment this trip was. First cheese crisp was burnt and the second was raw the only good thing was they didn't try to charge us. No manager stopped by they just said we are free to go, what has happened to service."}
{"text":"Absolutely my FAVORITE restaurant! I have great memories at this location and the location in Mesa. They serve genuine Mexican food! I also love the Spanish design of the building and everything. After reading some of the reviews, I can admit that the parking isn't very good, but I've never been turned away because there weren't any spots open. I also wish they kept the indoor waiting area (they remodeled it to become a private room), but the food is just so good that it can't shake my 5-star rating!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of \"Sunday Funday\" in Valle Luna's cantina. It's happy hour all day and they have good specials. The $4.50 Margarita is my favorite drink and I love the bandito burros with their fantastic guac. The reason why I gave them a 4 is because I went tonight and was a bit irritated that they told us their meat filling for their chimichangas or whatever they put the fillings in are pre-made and the cooks would not make it to order. My boyfriend hates onions to the point of not eating whatever it is if the tiniest bit of onion is found. We asked if they could make a chicken chimi without onions and not only did the waitress say no, she didn't even ask. I don't know if that's laziness on her part or if she's asked so many times already that she already knows the answer. Then she explained that the chicken was pre-made, but if we order the pollo, that's not pre-made. That was rather confusing but I think we figured out it's a chicken breast that they grill and shred for the dish instead of the mix of white and dark meat they usually use.   I will definitely keep coming back to the cantina for their Sunday specials. They're the best around. However, if you have someone with you with food allergies, I don't know how accommodating they are for you and I think a restaurant should be able to make your food to order."}
{"text":"I have been going here since i was 7 and now im 26. always had great food and service. always be my #1 rest"}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been coming here every Friday for 2 years. The food is the best Mexican around (and we've tried them all). The service is always great.  Only drawback is the limited parking but it's worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Valley Luna always provides a nice evening whether it's my wife and I or a group of the guys. You get a decent amount of food for the price and it always tastes good."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a little girl and I still love the food here. Definitely some of the best Mexican food that I have had around here. Don't even know a good comparison to this place. They are often busy on the weekends but the service is usually pretty consistent! I often crave this place and I wish it was closer to me so I could end that craving ):"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because I went back and you just cannot find a tastier pollo fundido. Yum.  I am still not a fan of the chatty teens at the front and all the workers except for one or two walk around with no smiles on their faces which would drive me crazy if I were their employer."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined here 3 times. On our first visit, we were impressed with our waiter. He was friendly and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the service and the food, so we went back 2 more times. We weren't impressed with the service on the following 2 visits. Both times, the waitresses were adequate- they brought our drink and food orders, which were correct. However, the wait staff lacks personality and warmth. Having been a server, I know what kind of service should be provided. After our 3rd dine-in experience, we switched to being take-out customers. The take-out staff is also lacking personality, but, since the interaction is brief and the food is good, we will continue to go there for our take-out orders."}
{"text":"Only been here once, a Thursday night.  It was very busy (usually a good sign) and we waited 15 min for a table.  Had good chips/salsa, took a few minutes to get our drinks, then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most.  I have chicken tacos, they were good.  I wasn't blown away by anything, but everything was solid.  I will definitely be going back, and would be willing to amend my review to 4 stars if they have a few spectacular items."}
{"text":"What a joke and rip-off this place is.  Bad service as we ate in the restaurant after 3 o'clock we were informed our meal would have been $22 dollars  if we were eating in the bar.  Instead we paid $44 dollars.  Yet our table as next to the bar entry from the main dinning room.  Total B.S.  Beware."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times while on vacation for Spring Training. I'd definitely  recommend it for families with kids as it's rather noisy. Can't beat the service and the prices are very reasonable. The food is quite good and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Huge menu. Food and drinks were solid/reasonably priced but nothing to rave about. Though I did love the cheese crisp :)"}
{"text":"Ok the wait to get in was only 5min to get in . Dinner was like 30 min .  Food not to bad . However as long as I waited for the food . I got it cold and Luke warm .  Fish tacos where good . I think much better if they came hot . The only thing that seem really hot was my wife sizzling chicken fajitas .  Even the soup was freankin cold . How do you F up on that ???  Will I come back ??? Maybe ?"}
{"text":"I could probably get my elite status revoked for saying this...but it dawned on me that as much as I've eaten here over the years I have never reviewed Valle Luna. Valle Luna is one of those places you just kind of take for granted. Like a sweet guy who maybe isn't exactly your type and is in the friend zone and  is always around until he disappears and then you are like \"Where'd you go?\". My analogy isn't the best,,,but I know what I mean!  So it always makes me smile when people \"tell\" me about Valle Luna. \"There's this good little Mexican place on Cave Creek\"....\"Oh...Valle Luna?\"....\"Yes!\"  Valle Luna is a place where I have had many a happy hour and super casual dinner. I prefer the cantina as I feel the service is slightly better in there...(not that I have had poor service in the restaurant it is just \"happier\" in the cantina.) Like my daughter told me just last night when I pointed out I like the cantina better...She said, \"Yeah...the restaurant is for old people\". I replied with \"Yeah, and we are NOT old\", which is funny because...well...I am actually old and was appreciative that my daughter didn't point that out like she normally does.  I love their seafood taco dinner with cod as well as their steak tacos. I also love that you can substitute calabicitas for the rice/beans. That gives Valle Luna a star right there. They have a really good Happy Hour menu too.So if someone mentions a Mexican place they want to go to on Cave Creek-by all means check it out!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I just finished eating the buy one get one free dinner from the Special Tuesday menu. We both ordered the number 5/ Taco, Tostada, enchilada. We hadn't been eaten there for a long time. When are meal came, the enchilada was bland, but the real disappointment was the tostada and the Taco they were drowned in wet salad that made our food soggy and impossible to eat. Plus when I dug into my tostada, there were no beans, only wilted cooked salad. I showed the waitress my tostada and asked her for another one, she argued with me and said I can only give you a side of beans. The food was horrific, I will not go back. Manuel is a thousand times better and much tastier. My husband is going to call the owner tomorrow and tell them about how we had hardly any meat or beans and the salad was wet and glumpy as well as all the food shoved together in a soggy mess."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The fajitas were good.  They need to change their oil. The chips tasted stale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!  Their margaritas are top notch... homemade chips and killer salsa!  I am a fan of the bean burrito, fajitas (the meat is so tender and flavorful!) and pollo fundido.  A word of advice, chicken and pollo are different here.  Pay extra for the pollo.  If you can get a seat in the bar, enjoy their happy hour specials.  I love you Valle Luna!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place in all of Phoenix. If I recall, this is the original Valle Luna as well. I've been eating here for as long as I can remember.  The restaurant is quiet and comfortable. It's a very basic restaurant. You can go in and eat your own meal for $8-15 no problem. The servers have always been friendly. I have never had a mistake on my order. The salsa they have to go with the chips is excellent and the food is even better.  Unfortunately, they recently changed the menu. Prices have gone up a bit. Oh well, I can deal with that. It's still worth it.  The separate bar is also pretty cool. They don't have any huge TVs--it's no Santisi Brothers--but there's enough that you can watch all of the major games at the same time. The place brings in some dedicated Cardinals fans as well. They've been doing caravans to the games on Sundays for awhile.  Overall, it's just a quiet, affordable, friendly local restaurant that happens to have what I consider to be the best Mexican food in the valley. The next time you're in there, do yourself a favor and get the Fundido, preferably with chicken. It's sort of like a Chimichanga covered with cream cheese then covered with a layer of cheddar cheese and is the main reason I keep going back. Easily one of my favorite dishes in the city.  It's a shame I live so far from this place now."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes from the valle luna mex. restaurant.  I have eaten their numerous times because of locality and party invitations.  I have never been crazy about their food.  It is\" valley of the sun sonoran style mexican food\"  but it just doesn't hit the spot with me.  They have a big following, crowded all the time.  Alot of the reason is they run specials tuesday (reduced price for seniors) and wed. (family nite).  I think some of the reason I don't care for the place is I have been treated poorly 3 times in the past.  Have you ever noticed that a place that has alot of business tend not to go out of their way to make you feel special?  Well if I'm going to spend alot of money and make them money  I expect more than the food, I expect service and made to feel that I'm important and they are willing to go out of their way to make me happy.  Unfortunately I don't get that feeling from the waitresses or the management.  But, there is always a but, if you like fajitas, I think they have the best around and on wed. you can get the single for 10 bucks.  They have really jacked up the price the last few years.  1 order is usually enough for 2., but if your really hungry, don't order the double, order 2 singles, I think its a better deal.  So now instead of turning left to valle, I turn right and go to Manuels on cave creek, better food, better service.  Oh and sit in the bar eddie the bartender is a crack up.   Bob: and there you have the truth.  Ciau."}
{"text":"Ugh. Well, I should add this disclaimer first: I've never really had muchmMexican food in Arizona that I like. Am I crazy, you ask? No. I am a Colorado girl, who likes Colorado and New Mexican-style Mexican food.  This place is greasy. I've had better at other places. They were nice, but I feel like I need an oil change now.   We will not go back.  I even just brushed my teeth to try and get the taste out of my mouth. Pepto could be in my future.  I have friends who like this place a lot, but they also like their food a lot more greasy than I do.  This is a good place if you like grease.  *shudder*"}
{"text":"I've been going to Valle Luna since I was a little kid, but this recent trip was a little disappointing.  They have good salsa, but the chips were terribly greasy.  The cheese crisp was also too greasy, and not that crisp, while the guacamole was okay, but nothing special.  Although the waiter at first brought a hard taco when I had asked for soft, the chicken taco was probably the best part of the meal, with juicy and flavorful chicken.  Valle Luna has been a long-time Valley favorite for Sonoran Mexican food, but it's not quite what it used to be."}
{"text":"I came out from California and was looking  for good Mexican food. What I found was a diamond in the rough. The tacos were great. The staff was on point and did a great job. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food! Love the Fundido!!! Service is always good. Been eating there for years have never had a problem."}
{"text":"Valle Luna provides excellent food and service."}
{"text":"My neighborhood go to place for Mexican food. I should say good Mexican food. In my opinion and my opinion only, places like Valle Luna are an example of a great family run restaurant. Great happy hour, reasonably priced menu. Camaron Veracruz, hatch chili pork, delicious. All around a nice, comfortable place to visit."}
{"text":"Salsa was straight out a jar from the grocery store, the fish tacos were wrapped in a microwaved flour tortilla, the choice of fish used for the fish tacos tasted like fish sticks they even had that thawed frozen taste, the tortilla chips were store brand, and the chimichungas  was blander then bland. If you want overpriced bland food with bad service i would suggest this place."}
{"text":"My family and I have  been regulars since 2004 and bring out of town guests to eat here too but I won't be back to this specific location. I ordered my usual last Friday night with green sauce on top. Instead of green sause I had a heavy brown gravy sauce loaded with black pepper, same kind of gravy you pour on top of mashed potatoes. It was horrible, I asked the waitress if this was green sauce she stated it was and offered to put more on top. I couldn't eat it - also I've notice the food is not as good as it used to be, tiny amounts of sour cream and quacemole etc are being served. We had 9 people and 3 people didn't like their food. I called and explained this to management the next day, Colin and a day-time female manager responded to me as if I was a trashy customer looking for a free meal. I pay my own way but because I couldn't eat my meal at the restaurant I took it home so I could see the sauce in the light. It wasn't green sauce and I won't be going back, there are too many delicious Mexican food restaurants to be treated badly and servced crap food. Pam."}
{"text":"Love this place. Me and a few friends head up here at least 3x a week for happy hour and house margaritas. Gets a little expensive but everything we've had has always been really good."}
{"text":"You've seen the storyline play out many times - great athlete in his prime signs a multi-year mega-contract, but eventually his body betrays him and he's parked on the bench, getting paid more than the starters.  Valle Luna, I'm looking at you.  My family used to frequent this place - you could get a nice meal for $8 or $9 per person, and their food was fantastic.  But Valle Luna has lost a step.  You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.  Their prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?  But much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.     So go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we'd been here, but due to disappointing food & horrible service don't see coming back anytime soon.   The one star goes to the fact we were seated promptly as it was only moderately busy and the chip guy immediately came by the table to drop off chips & salsa. It was all downhill from there.   *Although we saw multiple servers standing around chatting, we sat for 10 minutes without anyone coming by our table before asking a passing waitress if we could at least get a water since we had been waiting so long. The waitress dismissed our request saying she'd send our sever over to do that and walked away, so we had to wait even longer to be helped.  *The Server that did eventually arrive had no apology or kindness about the long delay, instead greeted us with a scoff and a very aloof attitude.    *Food was soggy, slimey and bland  *When we pointed out my food was so slimy it was inedible, the server just stood there stood there, until finally arrogantly making a couple comments like it was out fault we didn't want to eat this mess on the plate. He even got argumentative that we had tried to eat some of it already.  I used to recommend Luna for Mexican food and a nice dinner, but can no longer do this."}
{"text":"Brought a friend here for his first taste of Arizona Mexican food. It was the perfect place to start with the chimis and tequila. Service was speedy and attentive even on a busy Saturday night. Not a huge fan of the salsa and hot sauce but the fabulous dinner platters make up for it. Red chili chimi is my recommendation."}
{"text":"I was having a craving for some tacos on the way home and found myself here! I ordered some take out and got the chicken tacos and they were delicious! interested to try out some other things on the menu! I also got some spinach dip and chips and salsa ! perfect snack as I kick back and watch some tv!"}
{"text":"Was here the other night , it was around 7 and the hostess was unwelcoming. Didn't catch her name just remember she had short hair . When we were shown to our seats the hostess slammed our plates on the table , a couple that was across from us noticed and were more surprised as we were. I was so upset & couldn't believe she just did that.  We ending up just leaving. And  ended up to going to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. Dirty salsa plates.I watched a bus boy set a table with silverware that he dropped on the floor.  I then brought it to his attention and I told the manager. I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is the BEST Mexican food place in Phoenix! I have never been disappointed and always leave stuffed and oh so happy! I'm not a big tamale fan at all from stores/restaurants but this place does the so good! Chips and salsa are the best always! Margaritas are yummy yummy with 1800. Everything I have tried I have loved and so has my fiancé and another person I've gone with!! Service has always been good to us...the first time was the best \"/ but I have not seen her in awhile. I love the coupons I get all the time for free dinners!! GREAT way to get me in there even on my diet \") thanks for making some good Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"We were not welcomed with a smile.   Just a young girl doing her \"job\".  As we were seated in the back room we walked by 5 booths that were empty but not cleared of their dirty dishes.  (yuck) There seemed to be lots of help but no one was cleaning.  The place was noisy and the floors were very dirty.   The back room where we seated was small and looked like a supply closets.  Even some kind of big bucket sitting on some clean up table and a broom leaning up against the wall. Our table had spilled liquid on it that we pointed out and the hostess just grabed some napkins and wiped it off quickly.  The service was good and we liked out server until she took my drink for a refill.  I saw her carry my empty glass and another glass from another table away touching so I assumed I would get a fresh glass.  Upon returning I got my glass ( hopefully) with my straw in it. They originally served my drink and gave me a wrapped straw. The food overflowed the plate which did not look good and it was almost tasteless.  Two dinners and one lemonade was over $27 without tip.  As we left we walked by 5 young men workers near a front desk all talking to each other.  No one thanked us nor asked us to come again.  We will NOT go again."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was about average. I had the chicken and steak fajitas. The meat had no flavor on its own. It came with cheese lettuce rice and beans. Some Pico would have been nice. The spinach quest was fantastic. An average place. Not the best and far from the worst. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Love Valle Luna. Been going there since I was a teen. Good service, good food. Love the two options of salsa/hot sauce. Chips are homemade. Great to snack on while you wait.  The Pollo Fundido is amazing. The Mrs. and I always split it and we both leave full. Deep fried deliciousness.   Friendly staff, good atmosphere. Very pro Arizona sports. Always enjoy my time at Valley Luna.  Only complaint is that prices have seem to gone up a bit. To be expected in our economy."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for Mexican food in the valley. Great seasoning in their food. Terrific salsa... We have never had anything off the menu that has not been excellent. Margaritas are good too.... not the best in the valley, but definitely good."}
{"text":"It is ok Mexican food, not bad but is overpriced for what it is.  I don't understand why this place is packed every night of the week.  The food does not warrant the crowds.  I'm baffled."}
{"text":"This establishment has exceeded my expectations time and time again. If I had a choice between death and a nice dinner at Valle Luna, I would choose the latter. Their \"shock dogs\" have engraved a permanent spot in my heart with their buttery consistency and fair price."}
{"text":"When I crave Mexican Food this is the place I love to eat .  They are always consistently good! It's a great place to grab happy hour too....I enjoy the mini bandito burros and the mini taco basket with the jalapeno cream cheese dip and a few margs to go with it....Yummy!!  I find coupons every now and then but even without a coupon the prices are reasonable. I felt I needed to review because it isn't a chain and I support family owned and a great place to eat! I would recommend it if you are looking for a decent Mexican Restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I want to give a higher rating, the food was a 4, the service was a 2, the menu on the table was a 1. We thought we were ordering happy hour margaritas but when the bill came they were full price. I guess the little menu they put on the table only had a few items that apply when you dine in. Not cool."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have been coming here forever.  The happy hour food menu is amazing and is offered almost all day Saturday which is a huge plus and pretty rare.  Everything on the menu is good.  My problem is I almost always order the Carne or Pollo Fundido.  Both are amazing.  Best Fundido I have ever tasted.    Great place to stop in on the way home for work for some chips and salsa and a big beer or margarita and a tasty appetizer.  Or come on the weekend and stay all day!  Bartenders and staff are always super friendly and funny."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMY!!!  My husband and I love going here for date night.  The good is great and so is the service.  And, as a bonus, we get coupons in the Valpak envelopes that come in the mail every month for \"Buy one, Get one free\" meals.  It doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Great food & quick service. I like how they have black beans as a side option."}
{"text":"They do a great chicken fundido.  And the luncheon chicken fajitas are great also.  At $10.95 the luncheon fajitas are a deal.  A good portion of chicken breast tenders, peppers, tomatoes, and the onions... oh the caramelized onions.  Good chips and salsa.  Always great service.  The only occasional issue is waiting at the front to get seated, this can be frustrating.  But once you're seated, dig in and enjoy.  Its also nice that they send out the monthly BOGO mailer."}
{"text":"Food...they have a great ground beef chimi, perhaps the best I've ever had. That said, the other dishes I've had here are less than spectacular. Avoid the fajitas unless you like bland, burnt food. The salsa is good and the chips are hot.  Ambiance....loud and crowded. You will have to wait for a table on Saturday nights.  Staff...one of the best servers we have ever had worked here. He was extremely friendly, informative, and efficient. A couple of other visits we were not as lucky. Our servers were rude and up-charged us for several things. I guess it's luck of the draw.  Verdict...not my first choice for Mexican but they have a great ground beef chimi and many coupon specials."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is amazing. My fiancé and I split a steak fundido. Their salsa is PERFECT. (Mix hot & mild) the parking is always horrible.. So go at off hours. Service is always fast. It's our favorite go to local Mexican joint. Yum."}
{"text":"Three of us ate here Friday Sept. 30 at about 8:15 pm. Two dishes of substantial sub qulaity were delivered. The pork green chilli was so dry it looked like hash. The lady who ordered it had a few bites and it tasted off. The waiter replaced it admitting the first batch had been in the warmer all day. I had pork enchiladas. The meat was also very dry and tasted off. The two of us with the bad dishes both got sick in the night and remained ill the next day. I called and spoke with the manager who told me it would be impossible to be sick form the food, as that takes 48 hours (a flat put lie). He said he would investigate, but never asked for our ticket number, table number, server name or time of our visit. Doesn't seem a thorough investigation can be done without this information. I would never eat here unless you dont mind old rotten food, getting sick and dealing with management that don't give a damn."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with 3 coworkers recently. We were promptly seated and greeted and had our drinks within minutes. This is the second time I've had Velle Luna food. The first time was   I ordered the combination place with enchilada, taco and, rice and beans. The meal was solid with the exception of the rice, which I thought was a bit dry. I didn't like the big onions in the enchilada, but that is a personal preference and at least I was able to take those out.  Overall, the service level was very good and the food in my opinion was also above average.  My coworkers ordered a variety of menu items and all enjoyed their meals, but couldn't finish them.  I would say that Valle Lune has some pretty solid food and would go back there without hesitation."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who is from the area, I must say at first walking in I was not impressed with the service at all.  There was a kid at the counter messing with the computer who did not even greet us I was under the impression he must be a server.  Low and behold after 6-7 minutes he turns to seat us, he was the hostess after all.  We were her for lunch the parking lot and dining room we sat in were pretty full, nothing fancy at all.  I don't think anything has been updated in about 20 years or so.   The waitress was no better, she gave us our waters and didn't return to take our order for a good 15 minutes.  I had a shredded beef taco and a green chili tamale, again not impressed.  The taco was typical the tamale was loaded with way too much melted cheese on top so all you could taste was the cheese.  My friend had the steak fudido which she says is the best she has ever had.  I do admit it was pretty tasty and the meat was very flavorful.  Although, the overall experience is enough to ensure I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Have been here several times in the past few years. Most recent trip was Friday night with a couple girlfriends. I had a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com & decided to use it, such an awesome deal!   We started out with some drinks. I had a strawberry Patron margarita & it was tasty. Jessica had some cocktail with Sweet Tea vodka & it was so good. Vanessa had a Michelob Ultra, can't go wrong there. Their chips & salsa are standard but pretty good. We all ordered way too much food, I think we were more in the mood to drink than eat (we were heading out to the bars afterwards). For dinner: Vanessa ordered their cheese crisp with chicken, Jessica ordered their bean & cheese burrito & I ordered their chicken chimichanga. The portions were HUGE so we left with 3 FULL to go containers. Oh & I forgot her name, but our server was so sweet & not at all bitchy about me using the g.c.   Overall, I like Valle Luna & will continue to come here for some yummy Mexican food!"}
{"text":"First of all the food here is usually fantastic and last Saturday, March 25, 201y was no different, however my friend and I was treated extremely rudely by the wait staff and manager. I just could NOT believe it. It turns out we were being a little too loud for the customer seated next to us with what appeared to me a two year old child. In stead of someone asking us nicely to tone it down, we noticed the wait staff kept coming up to us and rushing us while eating our food. I became to get annoyed and my friend and I started making jokes about it to each other during our PRIVATE conversation. Mind you, we were not extremely loud, we were NOT drunk although we each were working on our margaritas. We did use the B word but not about anyone specifically, we did not single anyone of the wait staff out, and we were unaware the other customer was upset with us. He decided to come to our table and very rudely, disrespectfully confront us, and then called me a B word as I was about to apologize for the misunderstanding, however he kept telling me his child was with him and his wife. I said, \"well this is a public place\". The shift manager then told us we had to leave! We still had our drinks and food to finish, so I said, we will leave when we are finished and she threatened to call the police on us! I told her I have been a loyal customer for 22 years and had NEVER been treated like that there or in any restaurant for that matter!  The man left leaving his wife and crying, upset child behind. They got their meal compensated for. The wife did come up to our table and apologize, therefore she knew and agreed with me HE was the problem! The poor baby was crying because her dad started yelling and swearing at my friend and I in public and the Valle Luna wait staff sided with him and not us. The Valle Luna manager, and wait staff was extremely unprofessional. They could have at least been neutral and sorted the issue out in a fair, calm manner. The manager was very unpolished and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Why is it so hot in this place. We were forced to take our food to go due to the hot temp in the restaurant. Waiter was very inappropriate with his comments. Well never be back even though the food is great."}
{"text":"Still nooooo good,  doing laundry next door i grabbed a bean and cheese burito ...10$  wtf?  wow ! i saw on the owner of this place thowing a fit on the news about wages going up and how he is gonna fight it in court If that guy was my boss i would quit. what cheap jerk"}
{"text":"Usually get the carne asada burrito but today I got the 2 chicken soft tacos lunch special. They were awesome and with their got salsa, even better. I just don't like the parking.."}
{"text":"Ok, here we go again.  Really..... I don't complain all the time.... Just when i get \"underwhelming\" food at \"overwhelming\" prices.    Checking out restaurant.com.... run across a gift certificate for this family owned mexican restaurant.  Ok, discounted food, will give it a go!  Arrived on \"Family Night\", Wednesday... Decent crowd, 15 min wait.  Wandered into the bar area, which was neat and hopping with patrons.  Found a corner booth and asked if we could sit.... a few minutes later, we were seated.  Immediately i asked about the restaurant.com gift certificate to make sure we can use it.  We were aware we couldn't use it on \"specials\" or discounted items.. so no worries.  The chips and salsa were average at best.  I believe I have had better salsa at a Chinese BBQ.  Maybe the bottled salsa that the Pace company makes fun of might have been tastier.... \"this salsa is made in New York City\"......\"NEW YORK CITY?\" ... anyway, moving on.....  My wife opted for the \"fundido\" chicken (around $13)...  and I,  the chicken chimichanga (around $14).  My daughters split the Shrimp Enchilada (around $15).  Just a heads up to the wait staff..... I'm not expecting Ritz Carlton service, however, splitting the entree in the kitchen would have been nice touch.  No extra work would have been needed.... just would have been appreciated.  Food arrived timely.  No issues there.  Silverware is actually a napkin and a fork.  Knives are placed on plates that \"require them\".  OK.... Don't know if I am wrong here.... however, every chicken dish that i have had at any mexican restaurant is white meat....not dark.  I cannot tell you the disappointment i had when i found my decently sized chimichanga was made with dark meat..... and for 14.00.  Same with the chicken fundido.  Dark meat.  I whispered to my wife..... on the scale.... you all know the scale you have with your spouse.... 1 to 10.... because you want to know their feelings for the joint......  1 being  WTF?   .... to 10... i can't wait to come back no matter the cost.......  She hints around a 3.  I just asked her.... if her meal was 1/2 price.... as on happy hour of family night... would she raise her score.....  \"absolutely not\".  There you have it.     Including 18% gratuity.... our bill was 38.80..... including the 25.00 restaurant.com  38.80 for a lesson... eh, maybe not too bad.....  i wish i could have liked you valle luna.........  It's not you.... it's me."}
{"text":"Our go to Sunday night place. We always sit in the cantina and always get great service. Love the machaca tacos and chimi. The salsa is amazing. I wish they would bottle it. :-)"}
{"text":"They have awesome food, along with awesome specials. It can be crowded at times, but I can definitely see why. Good atmosphere, service is a little lacking in customer service, but not horrible. I visit this place often and will continue to do so as long as the prices remain reasonable."}
{"text":"The fundito is superb!  Dianna always makes our dining experience the best.  We eat  Mexican food a lot. This is excellent and even reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Been coming to Valle Luna for years now, they are by far my favorite Mexican place int he valley for sit down.  If I want fast food, I'll go to chipotle but for a sit down experience better than macayos, i'll come here.  Try the fajita's, they are fantastic.  If you have a tight budget, consider going on Wednesday night for some great values and always look out for the coupon mailers.  We normally try to go once a month."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, I called to make reservation, they said we don't talk reservations.... got there they said I shoulda called n made reservation.... party of 8 waited HOUR N HALF then gave us different booths!!! And our waiter said we couldn't b on same check cuz the other table wasn't in his section, I WAS charged for my birthday ice cream!! It was HORRIBLE!!  DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! RUINED MY 30TH BIRTHDAY!! Food ok, staff so bad I will tell everyone I know to go to bell location!!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially green chili tamales. A little dark inside, but a fun place to go for  a work lunch (quick!) or any other meal."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are tasteless nothing on the menu is spicy!!! Our waitress was awful we had to ask for silverware!! Beans are burnt on the plate !! Blah not going back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Bell Road location on a Wednesday evening, around 6:30pm.  The parking lot was almost completely full and there were people waiting outside and inside.  We were told 20-25 minutes, but it was around 10 minutes.  The atmosphere is excellent.  It reminded me of the mexican joints back home in West Texas.  The service was perfect.  They have dedicated chips and salsa servers that make sure you stay topped up throughout the entire meal (if you're like us and go through two baskets of chips).  Drinks were refilled before they were even empty.  There were a lot of daily specials to choose from for under $9.  My wife said her enchiladas were some of the best she ever had.  I ordered steak and pork fajitas and they were mediocre.  The portions were really big.  I look forward to going back and trying something other than fajitas.  It may have just been an off night for them, but I'll just play it safe and order a regular combination plate and also save a few more bucks next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! The wait staff are amazing! During football season the family goes up to watch every game! Delicious food, awesome bloody Mary's and good people. Don't ever change! :)"}
{"text":"First time at this location (have visited the bell road location many times) & I was extremely disappointed. I ordered some chicken sandwich thing that came without the flavored mayo I was excited for so the sandwich was bland & my potato cake that came on the side was near frozen in the middle & inedible. & I had to stare at a dirty table next to use that wasn't cleaned the whole time we were there. Will never go back to this location!"}
{"text":"I love it there!  The service is wonderful. We Always go to the bar side, the bar tender serves a whole bunch of tables plus bar, and keeps a smile on! Food is always excellent.  I try to go 2 to 3 times a month! Only Mexican restaurant we go to! :)"}
{"text":"I never, ever leave a poor review, but there is not one saving grace about this restaurant.  We start out with the disgruntled waitress, Kayla. It is more than apparent that this waitress is so unhappy with this job, she makes it unpleasant for the customer.  Salsa and chips at the table - salsa is a complete waste of time - watered down and you can buy better at Safeway.  Worst margarita ever.  Who serves warm margaritas? This drink had approximately 3 ice cubes and little or no tequila. Only half the rim of the glass had salt.   Now to the food. First, if your plates are scalding hot, how long has this dish been sitting under the warming lights?  I'm not sure if the tacos were hard or soft shell due to the fact that they sat under the hot lights so long the top of the shell was hard but the middle of the taco shells fell apart because they were so soft.  The enchiladas were hard and crusty outside and all the cheese had run out across the plate.  Unfortunately this place has really slipped."}
{"text":"Great food and vibes. Service is spectacular but the wait is a little long. Evenly priced as well with free salsa."}
{"text":"Decent ambience. Mediocre service. Terrible food. All the meat was overlooked and had no flavor. We ordered fajitas and fundido. They were inedible. I didn't even bother sending them back. Would not return - even if I was starving"}
{"text":"What I love about Valle Luna on Cave Creek is the ambience of the place.  Very much like an extended mom and pop's place.  The food has always been served hot and fresh.  I've never once had a bad meal there.   Service is great with the wait staff.  They check and make sure everything is going okay and your glass is never empty.  (which is a MAJOR thing with me)  The only downside I can say about this location is when you first walk in the door, the kids in the front (hostess) does not acknowledge you when you walk in.  If you've been there, you know the door is directly in front of the hostess/check out desk.    If you are a margarita fan, the House Margarita is not for you.  All in all, I love this location and will continue to go there.  Great food for the money."}
{"text":"Service sucked. I had to ask to get a table cleaned, chips and salsa too. never go again Food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"We are in town for padres spring training.  We used yelp to find a Mexican food restaurant right down the street from our hotel.  From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed.  There was about a 30 minute wait for restaurant seating so we opted for the Catina, it was relaxed, service was so great even though it was quite busy and the food - AMAZING!!  My husband & I  recommend this place to anyone and everyone that's in the area.  Debra T San Diego, CA"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant! We love the gluten-free options and always enjoy their tacos and margaritas!"}
{"text":"It had been years since we ate at Valle Luna on Bell. Was expecting the same great food but what a HUGE disappointment.. hostess unfriendly waiter took forever to take our order  it was only 4:00 and about 5 other couples in the place. Our food was semi warm and unfavorable the ice tea was dark and tasted like it had been sitting for days... and the prices were a bit high ...we will not be returning"}
{"text":"Very good food here. Big portions. Friendly staff. A Phoenix staple for many years. It;s a good choice. Go early - always busy."}
{"text":"We had amazing service in the lounge, young lady server was fantastic, chips and salsa excelent. food was good, happy hour great prices.  Always a busy place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times over the past few years. I get the same thing, the pollo fundido. It satisfies my Mexican cravings.  The atmosphere is fun, maze like. Service is decent and like most places if something is wrong they are quick to fix it. This is a great local restaurant. I love how it lacks the ultra corporate feel of most main-stream joints. Great Mexican!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorite goto places to eat... Love the fundito... Great service from Jared. He has a butt load of tables and still never makes us wait. Awesome server."}
{"text":"This place is great !!! I love the food and the staff are always super friendly !! They also have good prices"}
{"text":"Good food and great drinks. They pour them strong here and the prices are good. Thursday night is senior night so it is BOGO for those over 55. It makes it a packed house and parking can be tough. Try the Fundido."}
{"text":"I have been a fan for 20 years and I never get tried if there food. Chips and salsa on my mind always."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Mexican restaurant. I had the sampler and it's ok. Nothing special overall but I would eat there again. If your in the fence and looking for Mexican it will do. Don't get too excited tho."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years.  This place reminds me of the Mexican restaurants I used to go to as a kid in California.  Chips are Salsa are pretty good, but I am a big fan of their burritos...some of the best that I have had in the valley!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic when i have been there in the past and the food is still good (love the mini tacos and the avocado bowl is well worth it for your chips and dinner side) but the service this time was sooooooooooo bad that it made it all seem not worth repeating!   They jam people into this place and over seat them and then you wait... for your order to be taken, for your food to arrive and even for the chips and salsa!  We came on a weekend when they are really busy - but they should have the staff to be prepared for that.    So in the future we will not come during their busy times!"}
{"text":"Going through the mail one day and ran across a coupon for Valle Luna.  Then I went to Yelp to check out the reviews.  Reviews were mixed, but hubby and I were craving Mexican so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived there and the parking lot was packed on a Wed.  Turns out, they have awesome dinner specials on Weds.  The wait was 20 minutes, 10 minutes later our table was ready.  Waitress (sorry, can't remember her name!) was awesome.  I told her it was our first time and she explained the specials.  Chips and salsa arrived with our drinks.  The chips were hot and not greasy, and the salsa had a nice heat to it.  These were the best chips and salsa I've had.  Waitress comes by and takes our order and asks if we had a coupon - which I totally forgot I had. I told her I didn't know if it was a better deal if I did the Wed dinner special or took advantage of the coupon.  She said that normally, the coupon is a better deal.  So she takes our order and leaves.  5 minutes later she stops by and says that the she ran the check both ways, and the coupon is a better deal.  WHO DOES THAT!!!  That is awesome. 10 minutes later, our food arrives popping hot.  Hubby had the fajitas and I had the machaca chimichanga.  The portions were big.  The food was delish, not too salty, seasoned perfectly, and not too greasy.  The rice was moist and fluffy - normally at other Mex restaurants, they are dry.  Our drinks were refilled consistently.  Overall, great food and great service.  We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Good genuine service from Johnny.   Had Shrimp & Pork Fajitas. Huge portion and packed with flavor. Dining companion has Chicken Enchilada Suizas and they totally satisfied her craving for Mexican food."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent VL quite often,especially when we have the BOGO coupon. What a great deal! I agree the parking could be better,but hey,I've been more frustrated in a lot larger lots. The hosts could be more attentive and friendlier at times but,all in all, pretty typical of teens with their first attempts in the working world. Sometimes we wait as long as 15 min. but it is usually worth the wait. Have been going to the Cave Creek Rd. VL for many years and can only remember one really bad dining experience. Everyone has an off night now and then I guess. Usually I get the Pollo Fundido (awesome and filling) and my wife gets the Baja Shrimp Tacos (she won't even try anything else cuz they're so good!) The  building could use some updating. New carpet and fresh paint would do wonders. They did put a new fan in the waiting area. :)  The service is usually adequate but seldom outstanding due to the fact that they are usually very busy. If you happen to be fortunate enough to catch them during a slow time it is a very pleasant dining experience with great service. Hopefully Valle Luna will be there for many more years!"}
{"text":"Pulled into the parking lot at 2pm on a Sunday and the lot was packed. Hoped this meant the food would be great. We wanted so much to like this restaurant but really couldn't. Food was marginal. Ordered fajitas (didn't even come to the table sizzling) and two combo dishes (both were super salty). Service was marginal too. Constantly had to ask for refills on water, more salsa, extra napkins etc...  So sad."}
{"text":"I love the chips here...I have for years...I am addicted. Last month we went for dinner to feed my quest for fish tacos. The service was great, we sat at the bar. He recommended a cilantro sauce for the tacos. I decide to try that. Overall, I was not overly thrilled with the fish tacos, or the sauce, but they weren't absolutely horrible either.  Average. I didn't like the sauce because I don't care for a TON of cilantro, but this my taste, and I don't take stars away for that.    We also went last Friday night and I got a taco, tostado and enchilada combination. They were also ok, I would have liked to have more flavor in the enchilada. I tried the chicken, beef and Machaca beef. I have to say, I really liked the Machaca beef. the taco was ok, I would get that again. I would pass on the other stuff though.    In my opinion, the food is average. Great atmosphere, great chips/salsa, great 'bulk' food service. Service can also be a little hit or miss...nice gal the other night...not great timing....great service when we sat at the bar last month.   As for the fish taco's....I am still searching...."}
{"text":"I have been here several times as I have a friend that lives two blocks away.  The secret to Valle Luna's success is that they serve food that is predictable.  Anglos have embraced this place for years because it is safe. It will not challenge your palate with unusual or unique spices or tastes.  The clientele most nights look like people who consider Applebee's to be Haute Cuisine ....the real reason they are always busy is each month they send out two for one coupons in our local mailers.  So it makes for a cheap lunch or dinner.  And I applaud this marketing coup.   No coupon no Valle Luna!   Service has always been good and they move fast and are attentive"}
{"text":"Great deals for HH. Margs and beers are cheap plus a tempting selection of HH food. Gets real busy during HH."}
{"text":"Always a north phoenix favorite.  The blue margarita was great.  G Mom was great. The food was great. This place is great. Come here. That is all."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was a little kid growing up in Phoenix, and I still go every time I'm back in Arizona (2-3 times per year). Mexican doesn't get better than the Sonoran stylings of Valle Luna. Prices remain reasonable, ambience remains mom & pop for the most part, a nice difference from the bourgeois-gourmet chains available in most metros (like El Torito or On the Border). This is simply the best Mexican food you can get in the state of AZ, and CA, NM, and TX for that matter. Tucson may have the chimis, but Valle Luna has the whole package, chimis and all."}
{"text":"Chips were pretty good, thin and crispy served with three different kinds of salsa. Tried the baja shimp burrito, could possibly be the best thing I've ever had at a Mexican restaraunt!!! So much flavor and generously stuffed with shrimp"}
{"text":"Absoutely love this place! Best pollo fundido around and I always enjoy their Mango Margarita's. They never disappoint"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.   First off, lights would be nice. I seldom complain about the amount of lighting, but it was bloody dark in there.   Petty complaint aside, the food was really uninteresting. The sonoran chicken was red, but had no flavor. The refried beans? Dry as a bone. On my wife's plate, they clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long because they were cracked along the surface and very obviously dried out. Seriously? I'd say the service was fine, but the waiter let it come out looking like that, so points off for not bothering to notice.   Second start is only because of the cheese crisp, which was tasty."}
{"text":"I'm compelled to give 5 Stars because my experiences with Valle Luna Cave Creek Road bridge 5 full years of enjoyment.   Their special take on Sonoran style food is the best in Phoenix, and the always fresh ingredients help to ensure that. Hot food is served HOT, which for some odd reason is a difficult goal at many other establishments.   Great Nacho chips, wonderfully flavorful salsa and my ABSOLUTE FAVE Hot Sauce!  Albondigas soup is as good as you can get outside of an 'autentico\" Mexican Mom's kitchen. A new feature, and worth a try, is the \"PEDAZOS\" appetizer. Outstanding flavor, and the huge portion makes it necessary to share. Burritos - particularly the Steak version (IMHO) - are a treat.   On top of the great chow, there is the warm, friendly waitstaff who greet absolute strangers as if they've been a Customer for years. No \"Bar Clique\" issues here. Conversations are always fun - in all directions - at the bar.   I must salute the awesome consistency of both CORY and IAN at the bar, as well as the able efforts of KELLY, their GM - who started a (very long) association with Valle Luna as one of their teenaged hostesses, and whose daughter is now greeting patrons with the same enthusiasm as her Mom!   I think that may illustrate what kind of place Valle Luna is. My wife & I have always felt \"at home\" there, and I think you will too."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate favorite restaurant. The food is awesome. My favorite dish is the Nacho Fiesta. Now you can get a half order. I just love it. I definitely recommend this Valle Luna for the best Southwestern or Mexican food around."}
{"text":"Food was served quick, fast and tasty! We arrived around 550 pm and was reminded about the happy hour that ended at 6. We ordered our drinks and food and both arrived quickly. The food was hot and fresh. This is a must stop location if you are in the area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for some fried ice cream, food was great as always. Jacob G. Waited on us did a fantastic job as always when he waits on us, very attentive and on top of things. Thank you Jacob."}
{"text":"Been coming here forever, service is always on point and food is always excellent no matter what you order. Love this place !!!"}
{"text":"Don't see many positives about the hostesses when I read these reviews but I am confused why because of all of the wonderful experiences I've had at the Cave Creek location. The hostesses are hard working young girls that deserve a little more credit then all is given to them. They seem to work hard at what they do and although some messing around is going on; let's all be honest with each other, they are just kids! I come in often; Fridays and Saturdays and always see the same girls, Miana and Tabitha working very hard on the take out side of the stand. Very very sweet girls who are personable and kind, always going through my order and making sure I have what I need! Much better service I get from all these ladies then previous years. Servers are wonderful and food is outstanding! Valle Luna Cave Creek is a great place for family and friends, dine in or take out!"}
{"text":"I've always dug this joint.  It's way better now that they expanded the bar.  I used to kick it here when I was single.  The food is dang good, not BLADOW!!, but dang good.  Good personalities working there.  All around cool neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"worst experience ever!!!! salsa was spoiled and my chicken taco was discusting... even the little i did eat i got food poisoning... will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite Mexican food place in town and only because the other place gives you free bean dip.  Had the street tacos today they were very delicious highly recommended by our server Taylor. I usually only get the taco salad but was encouraged to try something different glad that I did also got the trio dip and was very satisfied with the guacamole. If you're looking for a reasonably priced tasty place to go definitely give this place a try and ask for Taylor."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants and we set up a reservation for 12 in the dining room, long story short, they didn't have our reservation,  but Josh the manager offered up some tables in the Cantina, where we wanted to be anyways.  Josh was awesome and accommodated all of us and Kailey our waitress was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I stopped by last Friday with a friend and we were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, even with a seemingly packed restaurant. The hostesses and server were super friendly and prompt.   We ordered the spinach queso dip as well as regular chips and salsa, and it was all delicious. The chips are some of my favorite chips I've had, and I'm super critical about my salsa and chips--I was a big fan!  Our meals were delicious as well. I got the Fundido, which was a little too swimming in cheese for me, but once I scraped a bunch of that off it was tasty and everything else was amazing. My friend got the chimichanga and was very happy with it. We also both got the mango margarita specials (mine on the rocks, his frozen) and those were VERY good (and cheap!). Overall we will definitely be back again, and when my family comes out to visit from the east coast I'll definitely bring them here for dinner."}
{"text":"Drinks are always good - Love the potato skins.   Try to time your visit between normal meal hours (parking gets crazy, but service is always great - even when parking is tough)"}
{"text":"Best mexican I have found so far. I frequent this place often, even when the food isn't the best, it is still really good. (Fundito)"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Avoid rush hours, wait times can be lengthy , decent Mexican food. Don't order to go! Portions are smaller and often lacking attention to any special instructions you may have given. If I didn't live down the street I wouldn't make a special trip to eat there."}
{"text":"Valle Luna has always been amazing but tonight we came here for a quick bite after unpacking and my hubby had what we would probably say is the best thing on the menu!   He ordered the Sonoran enchilada dinner with red pork and let me tell you it was ABSOLUTELY fantastic! We should have taken a picture of it before he devoured it, but it's a little too late! We definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to get lunch today about 12;50 pm. I walked into the Cantina and saw several table and booths with signs on them Reserve for 4:00 pm. WTF is wrong with you people it is only 1:00 pm. We sat at dirty table and cleaned it up ourselves after standing by it for 10 mins or so. The bus person was very nice. After another 15 mins we asked the bus person if we could get a menu. Then had to ask  again to have someone come over and take our order. The service continues to get worst every time we stop in. It seems you count only on the people you Reserve the tables for to pay the bills and could careless about your other customers. Well good luck with that. Just so you know the Machaca today was dry and awful. Thank goodness the Cave Creek location has great customer service and food is always very good."}
{"text":"10/22/2015. We have been going to Valle Luna on Cave Creek Rd since they opened in the 80's and the food was amazing. We still stop in once in awhile, I have to say the food over the last couple of years has really lost it's taste. Today, it was tasteless. The salsa had no taste, no onion, no green chili, no garlic, no salt, no cumin, no cilantro, no jalapeno, and no red pepper.  Honestly, I don't know how they make the salsa but what I do know it was not the Valle Luna salsa it used to be. Today, the re-fried beans tasted as if they opened a can and warmed them up. The Spanish rice looked like the cook added some color to plan rice and called it Spanish rice. There was no onion, green chilies, no cumin, no stew tomatoes, and or chili power. The ground beef taco and the red sauce on the cheese enchilada was tasteless and the saddest thing  no matter how much salsa you poured on the food it did not help it.  Please bring back your old recipes and cooks and start really cooking again."}
{"text":"Two words: POLLO FUNDIDO. I swear they put some sort of addictive chemical in this dish that makes you crave it everyday. It has a ridiculous amount of calories and fat. My ass jiggles for about a week after I eat this dish and therefore I can only have it about once or twice a year. I eat it and then go take a nap. Then I get up from my nap, go to the fridge, get out the leftovers and eat the rest of it....then I go back to bed. Then I dream about it. DAMN YOU POLLO FUNDIDO! This stuff is my kryptonite."}
{"text":"I love coming for the happy hour. Wish all flavors of Margaritas were on special the melon one sucks."}
{"text":"Long time fan of Valle Luna.  I love feeding the ducks chips!  Oops, ur not supposed to feed the ducks....  Anyways.  The Happy hour is prolly in my top 5 for the entire valley.  I especially love \"Cardinal\" home games on Sunday.  Happy hour is all day and they always have drink specials.  Unlike alot of so called Happy hours in the valley, you actually leave here \"HAPPY\".  The Fundido is a for sure hit with the newbies and I really like the Chimis.  Give them a try.  I go to the one on Dobson and Ray in Chandler. :)"}
{"text":"Portions were huge (biggest enchilada I've ever seen) and the prices were more than fair. The food tasted great and it was delivered hot.  We were brought here when we were visiting from out of town. I loved it. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Well worth the trip across town. I will return next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was great, unfortunately the service was pretty terrible. Our server never introduced himself, greeted us with \"can I get you a drink?\" Pace of service was very slow, which we understand that he might be busy, but it wouldn't hurt to smile and be kind to us. So if that's the experience you want, come eat at Valle Luna Phoenix!"}
{"text":"not horrible, not great.   the service was actually very good. our waiter took our drink order shortly after we sat, and our food came out scary fast. I ordered the prickly pear margarita. it was a good size, but like most Mexican places I've been to, I could barely taste the tequila. I ordered the chimichanga for dinner, and it was just ok. the flavor was there and the shredded steak was tender, but the tortillas were thick and chewy. definitely not the flakey fried perfection you'd want from a chimichanga."}
{"text":"I keep getting dragged here for group lunches and dinners.  It's never great. In fact, I don't understand why it's rated so high, especially with number of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. . The chips taste off like the oil's been used for 9 other things first.  The salsa is ok. The service is ok. The entrees are one step below ok. Whatever you order will come mushed together on your plate, welded together with cheese.  I have friends who love getting their free birthday dinner or sitting at the bar for a 'dinner' consisting of beer and chips.  If that's your thing, ok.  But don't expect much from the food. Upside is it has a decent parking lot so it's not hard to park.  There are no stairs to get in and out but navigating once inside the restaurant is tight. Wheelchair patrons should call to ask for seating in advance (my suggestion, not a restaurant requirement)."}
{"text":"We tried Valle Luna because we had a Restaurant.com certificate and were severely disappointed in the quality of the food, the service (waiter kept messing up our totals at the end), the ambience. We do not intend to ever go back. Sorry."}
{"text":"The bartender at Valley Luna is a asshole.when we asked for chips n salsa, he said,its not my problem, the manager said she would comp some of the meal..they didn't comp anything. .the owner came out to the parking lot and accused us of not paying. .we left cash on the table..they didn't even look..never going there again"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Phoenix (so far in my 6 years here).  Food is all around great. Authentic Mexican platter style dishes at reasonable prices. Their frijoles de Ora(I think that's what the say) are amazing and my wife will drag me there just for chips and salsa!   Wednesday nights, kids meals are like $1.50 and they have a menus of about a dozen dinner plates for under 8 bucks. Amazing to eat a huge meal for 4 at under $20! Believe me tho, it's worth coming on regular price nights anyway.   The bar is always busy and they seem to have a good selection of both hard and soft beverages.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Michala was our server tonight. As busy as it was she didn't miss a beat. Great service! Thank you"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Moon Vallry,   Tuesdays are 2 for one for old timers best deal in town"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurant. Food is always awsome service is always great. Very good margaritas the best around"}
{"text":"Got a coupon and decided to check it out.  WOW! Food was delicious, service impecable. Decor is kinda old school. But was clean and no odors.  We ate in the bar and were waited on by Joe. Have to say Joe is an asset to Valle Luna."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past.  This is by far the worst experience ever.  It took 40 minutes + to get our food.  Damage control should have been the waiters priority. Instead we got a \"sorry\". I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon. Very disappointed all the way around."}
{"text":"Can't stop coming here.  I love the chips and salsa.  The grilled wings..the service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 4 star for the pork fundido...been eating this for years at both north valley locations, always yummy.   Service was great.  My biggest complaint here and all restaurants,  carpeting....yuck, yuck, yuck, always super smelly and disgusting.   Rip it out, put in tile!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was terrible from start to finish. I probably eat/get take out from here at least once a month. I called tonight for pick up, and go figure the girl was super rude, said food would be ready by 9:15..ok, whatever. 9:40 and I finally get my food. $20 for shitty tacos, beans that have no flavor, and salsa with pieces of WOOD in it..... I won't be back. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Warning, the salsa, spinach queso, guacamole are pretty spicy. This is coming from real Mexicans, well at least 1/2.  My kids usually love guacamole and their mouths were on fire. They kept on asking for more water, LOL. The spinach queso was a little watery, especially for the $6 we paid for it. Overall, the food was good, but not \"great.\" The service was pretty good. I don't know why we had to wait so long upon arrival when there were plenty of empty tables on a Sunday Evening. I have had much better in So. CA."}
{"text":"Always delicious. We like to come for the margaritas! The only food item we have ever been disappointed in is the nachos. Other then that it's all good. Our favorite hot sauce."}
{"text":"Met some colleagues in a different office for lunch here today - had never even heard of it before. This Valle Luna location is in a strip mall which has definitely seen better days (as goes for much of its immediate surroundings). However, inside ain't so bad.   Very dimly lit, I was taken to a dining room and given a sizeable booth while I waited for my colleagues. I looked around - it was amiable enough and I was given a glass of water and asked if I wanted to start off with a cheese crisp. The waitress looked confused when I laughed while saying \"no\" but to be fair, she doesn't know the three act play which is my digestive system.  I then kept looking around and saw that the sole TV in the room was tuned to Fox News. Fox News? Listening to blowhards while eating lunch in a restaurant? Minus a star.    My colleagues eventually arrived and we ordered. One got the chicken burro, another some grilled fish dish, another got grilled veggie fajitas (although because this is a \"Sonoran\" restaurant they're not called fajitas but something else which I promptly forgot) and I got the sizzling chicken not-called-fajitas fajitas. The waitress was very accomodating in ensuring that my dish and its accompaniments were de-lactosed, scoring extra guac instead of sour cream.  When the entrees arrived I already had my mind made up that this was going to be run of the mill food. Nothing spectacular, but nothing that bad either. I filled up my flour tortilla (no corn - minus a point) with black beans, rice, chicken (with grilled onions & bell peppers), guac and a little salsa. Almost all the fajita ingredients were as I expected: nothing spectacular.   But the chicken? Hot damn. That was good. Not just good, GREAT. Blew Chili's chicken fajitas right out of the water. Whatever spices these guys used did the trick. Extremely savory and mouth-watering. And the grilled onions put In N' Out to shame. It was just too bad that everything else the chicken came with was not nearly as memorable.  That said, since I work in a lame part of town, I'll definitely come back here again, because the chicken was that good and the service was really attentive and friendly. Definitely beats that mind-numbingness of standing in a 50-person line at Chipotle during lunchtime any day."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service by Analy and fantastic food! I highly recommend the watermelon margaritas."}
{"text":"Greeted with the stench of bathroom disinfectant and stale grease at the front door. This place obviously has a neighborhood following that is accustomed to the odors. For a quick lunch ordered an ala carte chile Relleno. The single worst relleno I've been served from LA to AZ, Albuquerque to Oklahoma City. It was saturated in oil and had the charred chile skin left on. The salsa and taco sauce served with the chips tasted  bland and canned. Just a poor choice for Mexican food when there are so many other restaraunts."}
{"text":"We've come here many times with various sized groups & just the two of us.  We are never, ever displeased with any aspect of service, food or the prices.  LOVE EVERYTHING about Valle Luna!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices and special nights for family and children. Even when they are really busy the wait goes by quickly. Well worth any wait there ever is. Go early on the special nights. Parking lot gets full! Service is good."}
{"text":"Luna itself great.  Especially for a chain.  I think I have 16 or so check-ins here.  Food is four stars but the service there is always great (I sit in the bar), which adds the extra star.  Their Mexican Pizza is REALLY good... really good.  Chips are always light and cripsy.  Their happy hour is top notch too.  Their house margarita has a punch, and I'm a big guy.  HH is 3-7 M-F and on Sat and Sun (I think from noon-6) also.  I'm a pretty big snobe when it come to mexican food.  Much of the menu is prettty standard with some stars mixed in.  Fundito is solid.  Green chili is a good one too.  I wish they would bring back the chopped tuna tacos.  They also have a special for check-in on Yelp.    Special note to management (who is great) too.  Please put a rail for our feet on the back side of the bar  :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have passed this place numerous times this past year and the parking lot was always full,  Well today I purchased a $10 coupon for $1.60 and decided to try the food.  What we have found in our travels is that Mexican food varies greatly from the Chicago area to North Dakota to Denver and now Phoenix.  I really enjoy seafood soup, but have not found it yet, and not here.  I settled for the veggie and meatball soup which was only fair.  THe street tacos were steak and mexican sausage.  Taste was very good, yet they were extremely greasy,  My wife ordered a chimmichanga which had the sour cream and quacamole she loves.  Everything was smothered in sauce and topped with a mound of sour cream.  THe rice and beans were the standard fare served at every Mexican restaurant.  She said it was okay but not great, The best part of our experience was our service.  THe staff was very attentive and our drinks were kept full without asking,  Even now I don't know why the place is always packed after eating there,  One thing I am learning about the Phoenix food scene is that overall food seems to be not on par with what I've had back both in the east and midwest and is generally overpriced,  Overall I'd give Phoenix 2 stars so far for food, but our search continues for good food at fair prices."}
{"text":"After two bad previous visits  & last night cheese crisp was burnt with no cheese, changed their salsa & not for the better, & hot sauce is now ridiculous hot, beans & rice dry & no flavor & shredded beef was like shoe leather with a burnt crust. Margs were still good so guess they have that going for them at least but something has definitely gone wrong here.  New owners? New management?  Or new cook, as we're often told if you complain?   Time to move on."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the service was quick. Once we sat down they were quick to greet us and get our chips and salsa (which the salsa is amazing). The food was prepared quickly, and tasted very flavorful and rich. I will be back again based on the service, price, and food quality."}
{"text":"Can't count how many times we have been to this restaurant over the years. Food is always great.  The service is usually good as well, but has been slipping of late.  The last two times in, have had to ask for chips and salsa.  Not the biggest of deals, but hopefully not a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"The waiting area has been down sized. Looks like I'm going to Ajo Al's during the summer. I'm not going to stand outside for 20 minutes in 110° temps."}
{"text":"Giving it a 1 star mainly for the service and  the was it is designed. Very cramped inside with very little walking space between the isles. The both across from us was occupied by a couple. The waitress (Melissa) was waiting on them and new this couple. She kept talking with them not even taking care of her other customers.  With very little room in the walk way she took a lot of room up. Her backside (butt) to my wife and her long hair brushing are table was really rude. Then there was another waitress caring trash tried to walk by dropping trash on my wife. The food was alright but nothing special at all. I honestly could have gotten the same meal at another restaurant paid less with a lot better atmosphere. I will not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Sit in the bar, they have best staff and the Happy Hour is amazing.  My entire family is here at least once a week due to HH and the staff.  Brian, Joe, Dese, Ashley, Stevie... This place wouldn't be the same without them.  Because of the amazing experience I have brought my team from work, 15+.  They agree they have never been so taken care of in a restaurant before."}
{"text":"Valle Luna have the best Shredded Beef Pizza, and the portion is huge. All of the servers are friendly, they are my favorite Mexican Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lick you plate is what you want to do.  Great prices daily specials happy hour great dinning in or carry out.  Be ready to wait for a table during sinner hours. Everyone we take there lives the food."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is simply a good, basic go-to spot to fulfill your Mexican food cravings. Portions are pretty decently sized and tasty. Both the mild and hot salsas are good, served with a generous helping of chips. Service in my experience has always been friendly and quick, even when they're busy. Margaritas are actually pretty potent, if not outstanding in taste ( but not bad, by ANY means ).   Overall a solid destination if you're up in the North Phoenix / Cave Creek Rd. area.  While I don't get there too often, though I live in the area, it's considered a staple spot for us.  Go check it out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite mexican places. awesome tacos and margs for great prices and the service has always been good. fast too, never had to wait even though its busy"}
{"text":"Valle Luna has a happy hour that you definitely can't beat! $5 margaritas that are quite tasty. The thing I've had trouble with at this restaurant is the food. I went on a Monday night and it was pretty busy given that it was \"Margarita Monday\". The service was not fabulous (I myself am a server so I understand getting in the weeds and having trouble keeping up) so I won't judge my server off of that. I ordered pollo fundido which is what I order at almost every mexican restaurat I go to. It came out luke warm and the chicken was so dark, I thought it was steak. I sent the food back and my server didn't seem too happy to help me order something else which threw me off. I decided on a simple chicken taco hoping it would be better than my original meal. It was fine, barely warm and nothing special. First experience, not so great. My friends and I went back a couple weeks later on a Friday and got seated fairly quickly in the bar for us having 7 people. Drinks were great as always! I did not order food based off of my first experience but decided I would try some bites off of my friends plates and once again, not good. Pretty disappointing as any food can taste good once you're 3 margaritas deep! I am always so surprised at how busy this place is for the quality of the food. It must be for the drinks, that's the only reason I'll ever go there. Everyone is much better off checking out Aunt Chiladas at 16th Street and Northern. By far the BEST mexican food Phoenix has to offer! Sorry Valle Luna, but I'll see you for some margs!"}
{"text":"Came to breakfast on Sunday after eating lunch and dinner for many years at Valle Luna.  It wasn't too busy but got chips and salsa right away.  The chips were good but someone at the table pointed out that they tasted like the oil needed to be changed.  Great bunch specials on Bloody Mary's and considering I'm sure it was made with a mix it wasn't half bad, I wasn't picking black pepper out of my teeth which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  I had the \"Lunatic Rancheros\" which is basically Huevos rancheros on crack.  So good and so much food! Complete with a Mexican potato pancake which though salty is enough to make you want to eat a dozen of them out of a paper bag in a dimly lit alley! And as a person who can eat Mexican food anytime after a long Saturday night a heaping helping of rice and beans on Sunday morning just felt right."}
{"text":"Ok food. Crowded and busy for senior night on tuesday. Not too much to rave about . Basic mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again. I went with some of the girl so happy hour with the  intentions to bring food home for me and my husband, when it came time to order I asked the waitress, when she dropped off the other girl food that I would like to place a to go order then. So it will be ready a bit after they got there's so I could stay and socialize. The waitress incised, so I told her how I wanted it timed and she said she understood. So I placed my order. I should have known it was going to be a disaster. My food showed up with all the other food, and the waitress was no where to be found. She showed up 20 min later. So I explained to her what happened and that I would like new food, and the check as soon as the new food showed up. She took the food back and brought the checks then 6 min later brought me my \"new\" food. Really, we all know that there is no food that can be made in 6 min. So I then spoke with the manager and got it all straightened out. That was nice. But I just got home and they gave me chicken tacos when I ordered beef. Not good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Shrimp and cod tacos were both excellent and sauce accompaniments are a nice addition. Chipotle black beans are tasty!"}
{"text":"Should've gone to Don Rueben's on Cactus and 43rd Ave instead. Valle Luna was closer to the Deer Valley theatre that we went to last night, 4/14/2017. The service was ok, the waitress was more concerned about her friends that were seated two tables from us. She never really fully stopped to ask us how things were and if refills were needed for the beverages. It was literally a \"walk-by\" each time. In the 5 minute increments she stood talking to her friends, she could've been assisting her other tables a lot more.  When the waitress brought our food over she was rushing and damn near caused the HOT ASS plate of food to fall all over my lady! Hmmm LAWSUIT?? She didn't have any oven gloves/towels protecting her hands from the SCORCHING HOT PLATE! Wow!  The Fundido was recommended, but trust, there is nothing FUN about it, nothing but fat and gristle in the fajita chicken. The chimichanga was not a blast, and the black beans were super dry. The rice was just OK. Margaritas? Again, just OK. Chips & Salsa? Great!  How is it that the \"free item(s)\" are their best items?? The chips & salsa were literally the best things that we were served.  That's not all though! A couple next to us had to have both plates of food removed from their table, because their food was COLD!!!   These people have no idea what REAL Mexican food is. Not giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"We had gone to valle Luna in chandler before but decided to try this one out since we were on that side of town but it was a mistake. Our waitress started off okay by taking our order but our drinks took awhile to get to us. While we were waiting for our food, we needed refills on chips, water and I had ordered extra lime that I never received. We had to ask another employee, Eric M who was extremely helpful and basically took over our table for us. We didn't see our waitress the rest of the night. If you go to this location be sure to ask for Eric M!"}
{"text":"I first came here in the mid 80's, and pretty much was a regular for about 20 years. We moved farther north so we stopped coming for a number of years (and our kids were younger then and not fans of any mexican food).  Went back recently, this place is still awesome! Service is excellent, and I cannot ever recall ordering something that wasn't incredible. Chips are perfect, margaritas delicious, has a friendly neighborhood feeling. Not fancy, and shows its age some, but still cannot be beat for great mexican food! Party platters are a great deal as well for take home parties and work luncheons."}
{"text":"YOU DID IT AGAIN! amazing food, and whether your dining in or taking out, the food is always great. Me and hubby always order the burro de la casa with machaca beef. Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"Took my mother and wife to lunch and the food was good but our service was absolutely terrible. Our waiter was awful, refills took far too long, couldn't get chips and salsa to save our lives. The experience could have been much better if the service was decent. It was awful at best"}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed going to this restaurant for years. The food has always been excellent, until the last couple of times we've been. I would consider it only average. We come down from Anthem area so we've always felt the food was worthy of the 40+ minute drive to get there. However, our experience this past Monday night will keep me from ever going back. My husband and I as well as my two-year-old and my three-month-old arrived around 530, a little before the real rush started. It took ten minutes to get seated which I don't understand because the restaurant was only half full. The hostess' were not moving very quickly. Then we were sat in the farthest corner away from people as we could get which didn't really bother me since we have two little ones anyway. But where we were sat shared the wall to their private dining room for large groups and this particular group was incredibly loud. My husband and I had to raise our voices just to hear each other. This was particularly irritating since there were no less than seven empty tables around us that would have separated us from this group some. We got our chips and we each ordered a margarita. Before our drinks arrived, my youngest started getting very fussy so I went and changed her diaper and by the time we got back our drinks had arrived... but my daughter was still fussy. So fussy that we considered just going home... between the crowd next to us and her crying, this was not making for a very relaxing evening. But I decided to nurse her to see if we could salvage something from this evening. And I did... I covered myself up and fed her right there in the booth, especially since we were surrounded by empty tables. My margarita sat... and sat... and sat. Never touched it -- wasn't even within reach. Side note, the waitress never came to our table while I nursed so I suspect that she had issue with public breastfeeding even though I was completely covered up (I'm very modest). My husband finished his drink and then decided to drink mine since it was melting anyway. By the time I was done nursing, I was able to get exactly three sips from the bottom of the glass. So we decided to get a couple of coronas. The waitress finally came back and we ordered dinner and the bucket of 5 coronitas for $8. Then the waitress informed me that it was the restaurants policy not to serve a nursing woman more than one drink. I said that I didn't even drink mine, my husband did and that I just nursed and would not be nursing again for three hours. She said she would send the manager Jessica over. Jessica finally arrived after about 10 minutes with a most definite chip on her shoulder. She told me that the waitress was not comfortable serving me another drink. Hmmm... perhaps you guys should get your stories straight. She also said that the waitress saw me drinking the margarita while nursing. Well, that's impossible because she never came to the table while I nursed. By then, my baby was sleeping soundly in my arms and I asked jessica based on the way I was holding my baby, what did it look like I was doing from a distance? Nursing... and now that you're standing here, what does it look like. No answer. By then we had been sitting at our table for nearly an hour with no dinner and my two year old was about done. They brought us another basket of chips that tasted and smelled very stale and I was very irritated with the whole experience including how poor manager Jessica's attitude was toward me. Her demeanor made me feel like I was a nuisance and terrible person for wanting a beer with my dinner and that I was jeapordizing the health of my baby.   As a business owner myself, I fully respect the right of a business to refuse service based on their beliefs. I am telling my story to explain my reason for never going back to this restaurant. They're reasoning was uneducated and instigated (I believe) by a waitress who took personal issue with my nursing my baby in public. Well, I took personal issue with her and Jessica's extremely poor customer service and so we left money for my husband's two margaritas and left the restaurant. We had been there for an hour... with only two margaritas and a stale bowl of chips to show for it. A complete waste of time and energy that  anyone with two little ones expends in just getting out the door, let alone sitting in a restaurant not getting served."}
{"text":"Good food, nice prices and friendly people. The place is well staffed although they could do a bit of spring cleaning, my side of the booth was littered with napkins and what not. Surprisingly they have delicious roast beef sliders."}
{"text":"Awesome grilled wings, best salsa and hot sauce, great service at the bar, great food specials for football and HH."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times,and I love the food. However,this past weekends experience was not a good one.My boyfriend, 18 year old daughter and I went here for dinner.   I ordered the watermelon margarita as they are my favorites.My daughter took a sip of it,and the waitress saw her do so.I totally understand that there are probably policies that need to be followed etc.The waitress came over and asked for her ID,and and was not very nice about it. My daughter thought she might be asking because she had a virgin daiquiri in front of her.My daughter told her it was a virgin daiquiri,and the waitress got rather nasty and replied, \"I saw you take a sip of her drink.\" I told her it was one sip.She than refused to serve any more alchohol to our table.Fine if that is policy,but be more professional next time.My daughter was so  embarrassed .I can see if she were sitting there gulping it down, but really.... I was ready to cancel our order and leave.It could have been handled in a nicer and more professional fashion. .She made us feel like criminals."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the good waitstaff and the fantastic decor.  The food was not so good.    I got a pork fundido and dinner companion got the steak fundido.   The meat in both was awful.  Pork was hard and chewy. According to companion the steak was not much better than hamburger.  And beans and rice came with the meal.however there were literally just 2 teaspoons worth of beans.  Although the decor is nice and the waitstaff were good the food not too good.  Would not go back"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and fun staff!  Vanessa and Colin are the best!  Always fun to join in on the bus to Cardinals games and actually hang out with the people working so hard to get you tipsy and full on a regular basis.  I love coming here and i sure hope they caught that lame gum ball machine thief!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Delish Sonoran style food. My favorite two dishes are the shrimp fundido platter and the burrito bowl. The shrimp are large and plentiful and the sauce is so creamy with a kick. The burrito bowl is a hundred times better than Chipotle. There are so many ways and toppings to create your bowl. You can have a completely different bowl every time. Staff is always a very attentive. The bear is great for watching games . You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had dinner at my favorite local Mexican restaurant tonight.  Their fresh salsa is DELICIOUS!  I used to come every Friday night but haven't been in awhile.  I always order \"off menu\" which is really just the verduras skillet (fajitas) add steak or shrimp.  Soooooo good!!  The guacamole is delicious!!  Tonight my friend had a build a bowl, with so many fresh ingredients for a healthier option.  I couldn't forget my Wine, so had a glass of house cab to complete the meal.  Definitely my fav place for Mexican in the area!!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't great... Salsa wasn't bad.. Food was not that great. Beans and rice looked like they came out of a bucket and beans looked like they were burnt onto the  plate. We will not be coming back here. :("}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere in the bar area. I have been going there for years and love all the TV's showing sports."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Valle Luna for many years, and unfortunately in the last couple years it seems like the service and food has dramatically declined. My most recent visit was on 10/16/2016 with my older sister and parents. We we there for lunch to celebrate my Dad's birthday.   I was surprised that we didn't have to wait for a table since it was Sunday afternoon, so that was nice. Once we were seated, our waitress came by a few minutes later to take our drink order, where she also asked if we wanted an appetizer. We ordered a cheese crisp to start. We waited a little longer than usual before she came back, but I figured it was just because it was a busy lunch time. Well, once she finally brought our drinks, that was all we had to drink for the remainder of our meal, she didn't ask us or bring any refills after that.   We never got our cheese crisp, and she didn't address it until our meal had already been served. Although she did say sorry, she mad a comment that someone else must have snagged it.  Our food was mediocre, and they must have changed the recipe for their cheese enchiladas, because my Mom ordered 2, and they were stuffed with black olives. In all my years eating there, I've never had olives stuffed in the enchilada. Is that a thing now? Yuck.   We waited quite some time for our server to \"check on\" us and by then we were just about ready for the bill.   The only consistency that I've experienced here in awhile is the chips and salsa being the best. Next time, we will consider going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been going here for 13 years. Love the food and the people here.  Try the mexican pizza. It's the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for training class and staying in the somewhat sterile north end overrun with national chain restaurants, I was really hoping to find something local to experience rather than something I can get anywhere at home. I found the Valle Luna almost by accident but was especially impressed with the bar they have. The food is great. Try their red chili in a burrito or enchilada. The green chile and corn tamale was really good as are their tacos and machaca beef. What made the bar so special is it was always busy with really friendly people, something nice about Phoenix, the people are genuinely friendly. The staff was also really friendly and helpful, There are lots of TV screens so you can watch the sport of your choice from almost any seat in the place. Food and drinks are served soon after you order them. I will truly miss this place! It was a delightful experience in Phoenix and I would go out of my way to go there should I end up in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Love the food. I ordered take out and they had everything ready in 15 minutes exactly. Would order again for sure. PARKING SUCKS! Park South of the restaurant in the smoke shop area and walk over is my recommendation. A little pricy but taste great."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner in the cantina today for happy hour with the boyfriend. Our server Brad was a super cool guy and very attentive. I'll definitely be getting the spinach enchilada again! (Heads up to my vegetarians/ vegans out there, their beans contain lard and the rice is cooked in chicken stock)"}
{"text":"Pork Fundito's are to die for. Great place for sure. Red chili burritos are excellent."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely great. Chips and salsa are amazing. The food is also incredible! This is a great place to bring a large family and not worry about being too loud. We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I almost choked to death on a bone in my shredded beef at lunch. After eating here maybe a half dozen times before, I ordered the lunch special with shredded beef taco and shredded beef enchilada, plus rice and beans. When I went to swallow the second bite of my enchilada, I couldn't breathe. I also couldn't swallow. Something hard was stuck in my throat. I quickly ran to the bathroom, gagged myself, and out came a bone in the shape of a hook about the size of a quarter. Why was a bone in my shredded beef? They remade my food, this time with ground beef since I couldn't stomach shredded beef after that. They comp'd my meal but not my drink or my friend's meal. He was finished eating by the time my remade food came. My throat has been scratched all day since the meal. Disappointed in the food and the service. I'm not sure I can handle eating here again."}
{"text":"Your Mexican grammaw won't necessarily jump up and down screaming \"¡Muy Auténtico!\" but this place still delivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decent service. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a 5 dollar off your meal coupon. I really like the hot sauce that comes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful. And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entrees are good especially the enchiladas. And I usually get a side of the calabacitas. They're open till 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actually make it over here. A late dinner after some event.  Parking is always good since it's a mall."}
{"text":"Love this place ..go at least once a week ..great service ..food and atmosphere..Damian and Joe always treat you like a friend Lb"}
{"text":"Good margaritas and food. Went there today, despite being senior day and cinco de mayo they are well prepared with lots of staff and extra tables set up outside."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona. Try the pollo fundido, its delicious."}
{"text":"Want a great place to stop in for happy hour? Want good food, low price and cold beer? This is your place. A chicken basket taco and two small beers (or one large) will run you a mere $10.  Lots is locals hang out here -including me- because of the atmosphere, food and service."}
{"text":"Not sure how they do it, but somehow I always get swept into drinking margaritas at their happy hour here.  I should add, this place has an awesome happy hour!  Don't make the mistake of ordering a bunch of appetizers thinking they will be small because they are so cheap during happy hour, as all of the appetizers are huge!  I went here with a gal pal of mine for the first time during happy hour and we ended up with a whole table of food because we ordered 3 appetizers...We were eating Mexican for the next 3 days!   I have never been on the restaurant side, but the bar is great and the service is generally outstanding (had bad service only once).  There are a lot of regulars that go to this place making it always fairly packed.  If you want a quiet Mexican restaurant this is not it.  Parking can be a pain in the booty because the lot is generally full.  There are some lots near it and to my knowledge I have not seen anyone towed."}
{"text":"I've been to Valle Luna lots of times, at this & other locations, and it never disappoints. And in all honesty, I'm probably a bit of a sucker for family owned restaurants in general (I find the corporate ones often a bit stiff in service & flexibility). I come for the warmth, the excellent service, and the food. I usually have the Sonoran enchilada, which, while not as good as Mom G's will still fill that comfort food void, and is excellent and the portions are equally generous (to say the least, I usually need a take home box). They also have some of the best chips in town and their spicy red salsa had the right balance of hot & flavorful. Indulge with a house sangria or margarita and you're all set. Great for dates or families, just expect a wait on Fridays & Saturdays (worth it). Work your way through their large menu, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Had my staple chicken burro enchilada style with guacamole. It was delicious! Chips & salsa are good too. The restaurant could stand some freshening up, but the food is really good."}
{"text":"There is always a wait of at least 15 minutes, but it's a large place, so I guess you can't blame these folks for being popular. We only recently discovered Valle Luna, but it has taken over the top spot on our list of Mexican restaurants.  Even the chips and salsa are a step above what we get in most places. The menu is fairly extensive, and so far everything we have ordered here has been delicious. I would characterize the service as average. They have great party trays that you can order for special events containing mini- chimichangas, tacos and other items. My office has ordered several of these. The menu is not very clear with regards to how these party items can be ordered individually when you eat at the restaurant; I'm not even sure if it's possible, which is too bad because I would like to be able to order these items as appetizers. I highly recommend Valle Luna."}
{"text":"This place was amazing very authentic .... hands down one of the best Mexican places I have been to in the pheonix area customer service/ waitress was incredidible very attentive and catered to our need I would definately come back to this place mmm mmm great as Tony the tiger would say :-) come on down"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is no doubt one of my top 3 Mexican restaurants in AZ. I find myself craving it at times and nothing else will do! It's an older restaurant with few updates. The parking lot is an absolute nightmare, and we usually end up parking on the street to the North. The service is okay- seems to vary depending on day and time. The food, however is so delicious that I just have to give this 4 stars. I could probably just come and eat chips and salsa and be completely satisfied. They are delish! The menu is big and varied. I'm a bit limited being a Veg, but the beans never disappoint. The rest of the food all looks wonderful and fresh. It seems a bit costly to me at times when compared to other similar establishments, but I seem to forget that when I'm in the place eating!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner and had a great time.    Service was great.    Food was perfect.    Overall a wonderful experience.  Tyler our waitress was as fast as she was friendly and courteous.    Fajitas were great, hot and not overcooked.  Enchiladas looked good.  Fried ice cream looked good.  We loved the cheese crisp appetizer."}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of Valle Luna. Mediocre food, dingy, hit or miss service - not my favorite place for Mexican. For some reason, my mom likes it and so for her I've endured.   From my experience there today, I will not ever return again. We were seated in a dingy booth with huge rips in the seats. Above us were the taxidermy heads of a buffalo and deer, both encrusted in years of dust and swinging cob webs - exactly what I want to see before I eat. Yum. (sarcasm).   I ordered a grilled steak burrito combo and asked if I could sub the rice & beans for a gordita de papa (Mexican potato cake). The waitress said this would be ok. While we waited for our meals we munched on the chips which despite shimmering in excess oil were pretty tasty. The mild salsa has an odd taste to me so I opted for the watery hot sauce - which is good and tangy but not at all hot.   When our food arrived I was surprised at the size of my burro. I know these days portion sizes are ridiculous but this was alarmingly small. Comparable to the size of a grocery store frozen burrito. But the potato cake was a good size so I knew it was plenty. I was excited about the potato cake and dug into it first. BAD IDEA!  I assumed it was supposed to be served hot, but this thing was ice cold. Not lukewarm, not room temperature, this was ice cold - like it had just come out of the fridge - or freezer! Obviously these are prefab or pre-made and heated when ordered - but the cook forgot to heat it! Biting into icy fried potatoes is pretty nasty. I do not recommend. A huge oversight on the kitchen's part. Please cook the food before serving. Thanks.   When the waitress came over to check on us I asked her if the potato cake was supposed to be hot or cold. She looked at me as if this was a stupid question and told me it was \"deep fried\" so it had to be hot. I advised her that mine was frozen and she offered to get me another.  About 10 minutes later she returned with something that left my mouth on the table.   The cake was served in a red plastic basket lined with paper. The replacement potato cake was not a replacement at all - it was the same one I sent back - with bite missing out of it. The paper was crumpled and so saturated with oil it was transparent - it didn't even line the basket properly. The cake itself (with bit missing) was unappetizing and broken up.  It's fine if they gave me the original cold cake back - I'm not an advocate for wasting food - but, at very least put some new parchment in the basket since this one had tears and salsa stains! Presentation is a big part of service when dining out and the way this looked was a joke. I am not a dog and should not be served like one, especially when dining out!  The waitress haphazardly apologized and left. When she returned I told her to take the potato cake away. I would not be eating something that was tossed and served in such a fashion. The appearance told me that the cook was obviously ticked off that I had sent it back - who knows what else was done to it before it made it's way back to my table. She never offered to bring another or bring out the original rice and beans.   The waitress asked me if I wanted to see a manager. Did she have to ask? Seriously, she herself seemed embarrassed when I pointed out the obvious to her. The manager came back and seemed aloof and uncaring. I explained what happened and only got a blank stare and and offer to remove the potato cake from my bill. Odd - since I ordered the combo, I assumed he meant he would remove my order. Nope I was charged $10.25 for my tiny burrito ala carte. $2 less than the combo price.   Whatever. I won't be returning. When I dine out I expect hot food to be served hot. I understand sometimes by the time it comes out to it cools off - this was not the case - this was flat out not cooked. When I have a complaint I expect a manager to come out to address it without having to be asked. When my complaint is valid I expect full compensation.   And even better was the roach hanging out by the threshold of the door on our way out. It was technically outside the joint - but you know it has buddies who made it in. Gross.   Valle Luna - I always had my doubts about you but today was the last straw."}
{"text":"Make the trip the location on 35th Avenue and Bell Rd. This one's salsa and food are kind of sub-par."}
{"text":"First time....lots of atmosphere. Greeted at the door like we were familia. Immediately seated in a booth. Our sever, Dusty, was there right away and took beverage orders. Chips and salas appeared and were lite and fresh tasting. Dusty came back to check, but we needed a little more time. Upon returning, we ordered the burrito and huevos rancheros. In less than 7 minutes ou piping hot food was presented. See pic. Tasted great and with service that matched, a great discovery. Will return."}
{"text":"So gross. Ordered a cheese crisp and it was dripping with greese. My main plate was not any better steak was cooked well done and I asked for some pink and it tasted aweful. Ended up getting food poisoning. Dirty and poor service."}
{"text":"Great food. Came out quickly as well. Would have liked a better seating area. We were slightly cramped."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars for years. We're now  seniors so we go on Tuesday for senior night. Special menu and the best two for one deal around. Great food and their drinks are really good. Very reasonable prices and the service is terrific. I highly recommend Valle Luna."}
{"text":"\"Went to Valley Luna on a Sunday for the specials I found using the Happy Hour app. $2 drafts and mimosas. Got there asked about the specials, they would not honor those prices, said they're $2.50. I decided to leave and the waitress bad mouthed me to my girlfriend...\""}
{"text":"We've been to this location many times. Chips were fresh and two types of salsa were brought, both OK. We botth had the Pollo Fundito with rice and beans and it was good as always with enough for us to take home for another meal. Service was better than usual, but i forget the young guys name. Had a 2 for 1 coupon which made it a fine deal.  Food and service has always been solid on all of our visits."}
{"text":"First off, this rating is for the Cave Creek location ONLY. The food is awesome and I may return to another location but never this one. It is really too bad because this one is closest to me and it is where I buy gift cards for others but no more. All because of the manager, Kelly. I hope the owners see this and maybe gives her some much needed menu and customer service training.   I took my cousin here that was visiting from Erie, PA. She wanted the best Mexican food so I of course brought her here. She ordered the Shrimp Fundido. I ordered the Chicken Fundido. I asked the server if he could make mine with just a couple shrimp and I would pay the Shrimp Fundido price which was a few dollars more expensive than the Chicken. He said that the manager said no... I ask for her, Kelly comes to the table, she tells me that it is \"pre packaged\" and cant open a package.. Weird answer so I ask for a side of shrimp and how much it would cost. She said \"she didn't know\" and they don't do \"sides of grilled shrimp\"...What? A- You don't know how much something costs and your a manager and B- You are making a shrimp burrito anyway but cant grill me a few extra? She was not budging. In the mean time my food wasn't put in at the same time and I had to wait while my cousin received her meal and ate it all before mine even got to the table....Well played Kelly \"Manager\" at Valle Luna's... I wont be bring a family member or anyone else for that matter or purchasing gift cards at your location ever again... super disappointing..."}
{"text":"If you've read any of my reviews, it's no surprise that I take into account the fact that Valle Luna is what it is... it's not backed by some culinary genius mixing up roasted pepper foams to top off a taco. This is downright classic, fried, greasy goodness.  There is some history to my love of the Mexican food. I originally wanted to be a chef so at the young age of 12 I got my first prep cook job in a small town at Zapatas Mexican Restaurant. It wasn't long until I was 13 and running the kitchen at night. I'm sure this was illegal, but who cared in Page/Lake Powell, AZ?  Long story short - I ended up pursuing another career, the owner passed away and the new ownership screwed up the recipes and menu. Since then, I have been on an endless journey to find my 'Zapatas' here in the Valley. The closest I had found was El Minuto in Tucson. And then one day, my brilliant friend and co-worker invited me to lunch.  That's when...I met Valle Luna.  It's been a dirty love affair ever since. A time warp back to my youthful days at Zapatas. The chips are fried in-house. The shredded beef tacos are everything I remembered them to be. I finally have found a reincarnated Zapatas!!!!  This is true Sonoran Mexican food as it was meant to be."}
{"text":"This valley Jewel just has some great Mexican Sonora style food. I ordered their mini taco basket...food was excellent.  This location is always FULL. If you can find parking which is limited, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars. If you need to park and it is full, just go next door and park in the Adjacent  strip mall, very very close.  I would highly recommend this location, however if you don't like to wait the 30 plus minutes, you can always go to their 35th Ave & Bell road location. I have eaten at both . There will be no disappointment on the food anyway.  I always order my food on the phone as they are always Packed. Makes it easier for us."}
{"text":"For Mexican food in Phoenix I guess it was ok. Green corn tamale and chile relleno were decent. Rice was bland and beans were disappointingly dry. Michelada had no ice and smelled weird. We sent it back."}
{"text":"This my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant!  I love to go to Valle Luna when I am craving some good Mexican food. It has even become somewhat of a family tradition as we go there for birthdays and family dinners.  While you look over the menu, you are served with hot tortilla chips and their special recipe salsa. You get unlimited chips and salsa, but make sure not to fill up on them before your meal like I always do!  I love to get the fajitas, they are the best in town. They serve a steamy hot skillet with your choice of pork, beef, chicken or a combo of all three, along with peppers, onions and tomatoes. There is also a side plate with all the \"fixings\" like sour cream, guac, cheese, refried beans and rice and of course, warm tortillas. You can ask for extra of any of these items if you'd like also, especially if you love cheese and sour cream as much as I do. It is a bit pricey, but there is plenty of food to go around for 2-3 people or take home for great left overs!  When I am craving something a bit smaller (and less costly) I love to get the Bandito Burros located on the appetizer menu. You get 8 mini deep fried burritos with guac and sour cream. I've shared this appetizer with friends a few times and everyone always seem to enjoy them as much as I do.   Parking can be somewhat of a pain if you go during their dinner rush times. The outside appearance is also nothing to be impressed by nor is the inside decor as it is a bit outdated. Nonetheless, the food and friendly service always keep me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Walking in, probably the first thing I noticed was that the carpet looked like it was straight out of a Chuckie Cheese.  Don't worry though, that's pretty much the only thing they have in common.  The service was pretty good.  Drink orders were fast and they dropped warm chips and hot and mild salsas at the same time to snack on.  I ordered the Flautas with shredded chicken.  The number 7 combo.  It seemed to come pretty quickly and was quite tasty.  The refried beans were topped with a good amount of shredded cheese as well.  The guac was quite good as well.  The biggest travesty of this meal was that I had semi recently eaten and was pretty full and unable to finish it.  Price for combo a soda and tip was $20.00  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night during happy hour.  The happy hour taco basket was ok, but greasy.  The Mexican pizza was better.  We also had two orders of Pollo Fundito and those were horrible.  Very little meat, cheese or cream cheese sauce (see attached picture) Our service was great though and margaritas were decent.  The mini bean burritos were surprisingly the best that night...Brian, our server, was very attentive and helpful- apologizing for the poor quality of food and told us it was normally much better.  Without the good service, I would've given this place only one star- which is disappointing since I have gone here with my family since I was a child and the food quality has gone down hill since then."}
{"text":"Arizona has many good Mexican food restaurants, but Valle Luna is one of the best"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Valle Luna over 20 years and I have to say that they are my FAV Mexican restaurant in the world! I can't believe I haven't reviewed them yet! They don't always have the best service, but they are always packed because they are so good, so I can see how the waitress can get a little grumpy from being over worked and treated like crap from the people that don't understand.  The mini shredded beef taco's, poyo fundito and shredded beef mexican pizza are my favorites!  Their chips and salsa are the best of any other mexican restaurant!   If any of you rated this not so good after just one try, I beg you to go try them again! Give them one more chance and then let me know what you think. But take my advice order the shredded chicken mexican pizza, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I came here after raving reviews from a coworker. The parking lot was full so I thought I was in for a great experience. Obviously they brought out chips and salsa like any other Mexican food restaurant would. The chips were stale but the salsa was tasty. There was a hot and medium sauce available. The was perfect for me but then again I don't like my salsa too spicy anyway. I also ordered a margarita but when it arrived to the table was definitely under whelmed. It was really small considering the size of margaritas at other Mexican restaurants. Hopefully this was a lunch size special.  For lunch I ordered the chicken chimichanga plate.  I definitely had good flavor.  It was up to par with other Mexican restaurants around the valley. If I were in the area I would eat there again but I wouldn't make a cross town trip just to eat here."}
{"text":"Not much to look at on the outside, but best mexican food in Phoenix.  Actually voted #1 by local paper in 2009.  Very reasonable priced as well.  A must if you want good, low-key, mexican."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Good service and great food. The portions are huge! I normally combine items from the a la carte list, because the meals that they have are too big for me! I personally recommend their tamales! They also have hot wings too!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley. Happy hour has some good deals too! Will be back to this place soon!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food ever, I love this place. Anyone who wants the best mexican food ever made should go here. This location is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and popular spot.  Very good food with many choices.  Everyone liked what they had... burrito bowls, shrimp burrito, carne asada, tamale, chorizo corn tortillas, & cheese crisps (quesadillas).  Would go again."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the Happy Hour in the Bar.  Not so much for the specials but the service from Corina.   She has taken care of My wife and I  a couple times and I find her demeanor to be exactly what I like in a server.    House Margaritas are good and the Large draft beers are great for the thirsty.   Had the Fajitas were tasty.  I little light on meat and excessive on Onions but very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yep, yep, I'm a fan...   Love Valle Luna!  Yes, the parking can be a little tight, and yes, the building is old and yes, the decor is dated...   But....    Yum!  Pure yum!   The margarita's are quite tasty and not too strong or too week.   I am addicted to the Asada Taco Dinner with the carne asada... talk about melt in your mouth delicious... perfectly carmelized carne asada in two very thin corn tortillas... simple, basic, and to die for.    My boyfriend has gotten several different platters and everything has been very good.    It's just good basic Mexican food... if you're looking for something fancy-- keep driving.   be sure to ask for fresh tortilla chips- occasionally we've gotten some that were cooked in old oil...  hence the 4 star..."}
{"text":"If you want real authentic Mexican food, you're better off enjoying your mother's home cooking than at this restaurant. There was nothing spectacular about this place...the price range was incredibly expensive for what it is.   Example:  $15 for a Chimichanga $12 for a quesadilla Really?? That is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I love the atmosphere but from what I've eaten so far it's nothing too great. Mini chimis were super greasy and the spinach con queso just seemed really fake and not authentic or from scratch, it was the consistency of velveeta so that's what I thought it was. The margaritas were just a pre made mix too... Idk I was looking for something more authentic. This is some what Americanized to me...."}
{"text":"This place was 5 stars in every respect.  Our waiter was right on the ball giving us refills, chips, bill etc. before we ever had a chance to ask for them. The Fundido and cheese crisps were off the charts. Great chips/salsa.  I'm from out of town and will be going again to try the fajitas before I leave!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times while visiting from Washington state. The first time I got a burrito, I don't remember what was on it, but it was delicious. The most recent time I got a steak quesadilla and it was one of the best thing's I've ever eaten. The cheese wasn't normal melted cheese, it was more of a cheese sauce and there was plenty of it. There was plenty of steak which was fantastic and plenty of grilled onions and peppers. It was also massive, it fed me for 2 meals."}
{"text":"Great Mexican spot. I am not from the area but I was pleased. My Cesar chicken salad was ok, but the enchilada and fajitas looked awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife & I have been going here since 1985. The salsa( I'm a huge salsa guy ) In my opinion is the best salsa in the valley. Their chips are always served hot and taste fresh. They are so good I could make a meal of  just their chips and salsa.   We pretty much stick to a few of our favorite dishes. After I make a pig out of myself on salsa & chips I start my meal with a bowl of Albondiga Soup (Meatball soup with fresh vegetables).  For my entrée I usually get a  SIZZLING platter of beef Fajita with grilled vegetables. My wife usually gets a Chimichanga.  Both dishes come with a side of guacamole, sour cream and Spanish rice.  In addition the Fajita comes with corn or flour tortilla. As for the flavor of their food, their dishes are bursting with it.   The food here is always cooked to perfection, tasty, fresh, delicious and served hot.  The service is usually awesome. In fact my sister who lives in Rhode Island always makes it a point to stop at Valle Luna to get her Mexican Food fix.   WARNING: If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're going to have to wait to get a table.   FOOD: Drool worthy Arizona-Sonoran recipes!!! Always fresh, consistent, and served promptly.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Service is usually good but they can get very busy. However I must say the wait for food is normally pretty darned fast considering how busy they can be at times.  CONCULSION: We've had our share of lousy over-priced Mexican restaurants. This place has been a go-to eating spot for outings with family and friends for years. Parking can be a challenge when they are busy but I feel their food is so good its worth trying to get a parking space.   RETURN  FACTOR: 100% We keep coming back! because we love this place.  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch today. The chunky salsa was missing something, not very tasty. I felt like it was just a can of diced tomatoes. The smooth salsa was not too good either. He ordered the pork fajitas, to me they looked old. he said they weren't as good as in the past. I ordered a bean tostada and cheese enchilada. The beans were tasteless and so was the enchilada sauce. One thing though, the chips were good and plenty. We have been to this place many times, today was just not worth the trip."}
{"text":"There comes a time in a man's life where he finally crosses the Rio Grande and tastes Mexican food from across the border for the first time and falls in love with a shy girl named Lupita.   Ok, so maybe that love story won't happen again because of the bloody drug cartel violence around the border, but not all hope is list. That's right mis amigos, love is in the air and can be found at Valle Luna.   The atmosphere puts you in South Texas, which is the only place you can safely find authentic Mexican food in the USA outside of Valle Luna. The menu encompasses every possible combination of rice, beans, cheese and carne asada possible. The combinations are endless.   I had the pleasure of enjoying the Fundido as recommended by my oddly all-American waiter who was polite, attentive and sported a stylish receding hairline and Underarmour shirt. Cheers to you, Bradin. You stay classy.   All I can say about the Fundido was that it was fantastic and the Spanish rice tasted like it was made by the gods of Teotihuacn themselves. I highly recommend Valle Luna in all its glory. From the homemade chips, salsas and excellent service on a busy Cinco de Mayo noche it was a highly enjoyable experience and I will be back, oh yes.   I deducted 1 star because I over ate and felt horrible for the next 7 hours. My fault completely, but a verbal warning would have sufficed before taking the Fundido challenge."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food! Good prices. Had the Relleno plate and was delicious. Hubby had the taco plate and he enjoyed them. Good cerveza, good food, good prices and great company!!"}
{"text":"TypicalMexican fare - it was pretty good but nothing special. The pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in the mood for Mexican food while running some errands and this place was nearby, so we decided to give it a shot. The complementary chips and salsa were very good, but beware the hot salsa has quite the kick to it! For entrees, we both ordered variations of the carne asada dinner and it didn't disappoint. My tacos were delicious and so full of flavor and my spouse said the same thing about his enchiladas. The meat was cooked perfectly and the refried beans and rice that the dishes came with was very delicious and cooked well. We really wanted some fried ice cream to finish the meal off but were both so stuffed, so we plan to get it next time. Overall, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"This place is a tasty locally owned Mexican restaurant. Salsa and chips are good. We've never had an issue using the Yelp check-in offer. The food comes out quick and our service has always been good. This place is worth checking out, not to mentioned you're supporting a long standing Valley business.  :-)"}
{"text":"There is a very good reason that there is always a wait and the parking lot is always full! My husband and I went and starting with the chips and salsa, the chips are great and salsa is very tasty! We each ordered a fundido, one pollo, one steak. Both amazing!!! Service was great, they notice empty glasses and are not stingy with the chips. I definitely recommend this location!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great environment in the cantina! Margaritas are awesome and don't miss out on the mini taco basket!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife go to this restaurant at least once a week and love it. The happy hour even runs on Saturday and is a super good deal. Appetizers are half off during happy hour and are super delish. I mostly get the wings which are very good and definitely compete with your local wing restaurant. Service is mostly fast unless they are just absolutely slammed. If you sit in the bar-ask for Ashley- best waitress here and she always does an amazing job."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and have always had a great experience until tonight. I asked for the drink menu after we were seated to which the waitress pointed out that margaritas were 99 cents. I said great I'll have a strawberry on the rocks. My husband and I had 4 drinks between the 2 of us and my grandmother had 1. We get our bill and it comes to 27.00. When we questioned it the waitress says oh yeah, that's not for the margaritas you got. Well that's what we ordered..the 99 cent margaritas.  She was extremely rude and went and got her manager. I should have asked for her name but she had long black hair and 2 crooked front teeth. She explains that the strawberry flavor was what wasn't part of the 99 cents. We explained that this was not told to us. The manager basically tells us oh well and walks away. What kind of service is this. LIFELONG CUSTOMERS WE WILL NOT BE COMING BACK AFTER THIS. What happened to the customer is always right?? You're decision to not back the customer over $30 has lost our business!"}
{"text":"I've come here for years and is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant. I always try to come during happy hour because some of their prices are ridiculous. I'm not sure if they still send out their coupon in the mail if you live near by, but if they do use it and try them out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this Valle Luna location and tonight my boyfriend & I got pollo fundidos with black beans & rice. Usually, service is awesome and the food is great. Tonight was fundido night so maybe that's why they just weren't up to par tonight. Also, the server brought us refried beans instead of black and asked if we wanted another drink when we were clearly ready for the check. Like I said, I'm a regular and tip well, but might not go back for a while because of tonight. Very disapppinted."}
{"text":"In the few times I've eaten at this location, it has never quite lived up to expectations. I have had family and friends that mark this restaurant to be their favorite Mexican food in the valley. And I can tell by the constantly packed parking lot that many people agree. I have just never found the right thing that meets those lofty reviews. I have found the food to be more bland compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area.  Still willing to try it out some different menu items though in hopes of joining the party."}
{"text":"It's americanized versions of mexican food.  Don't go here if you're looking for the real thing, only the american-washed version of the real thing.  The wait staff is usually pretty ok, but the hostesses are by far the worst.  I don't understand how they even got jobs as the face of the restaurant/first person you see when you walk into the establishment.  They always seem to be teenage girls who are too busy talking to each other to give a damn about customers coming in.  When they do turn around to service you, they act like you're ruining their day instead of paying them their paychecks.  :P Also, if you're under 65 I don't recommend going during the day, it's a Senior Citizens playground before happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer and great environment! Oh and the chips and salsa are some of the best in AZ!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Valle Luna a full five stars, but the service the last couple of times we have been there has not been bueno.  Our last waitress barely even waited on us - we received most of our service from bus boys who realized our drinks and chips were empty and just couldn't avoid us any longer.    Aside from the lack of service on the last couple of visits though, I'm just in love with Valle Luna.  It's like that boyfriend who you know is bad for you but you just can't resist going back!  Number one food recommendation hands down - the CARNE ASADA FUNDIDO!  I swear there's crack cocaine mixed in with the fundido sauce.  Only kidding of course, but that's how good this plate is.  This on top of the awesome hot sauce they serve by request with the chips, and I'm done for the night.  Yes, done.  Fat, happy, comatose done.  Love it."}

{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere. What more do you want? Went here a week ago and again last night. Had the same, great experience both times. Definitely our new Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"I have not sat down to eat here, I have always got it to go. The food here is just bland. How people give it four stars just blows my mind. The food seemed like it was sitting around for awhile in the kitchen before beeing served. I live 2 blocks from the place, so it didn't happen because I had to drive home.   I have given it multiple tries to make make sure it wasn't a one time bad mealI would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have always loved going to Valle Luna. Its not pretentious, the food is yummy and the drinks are tasty! My fiance' and I go to split appetizers and a few beers every few weeks. And when visitors come in, we take them to Valle Luna for  good time. Plus, the owners are heavily dedicated to their community. I have volunteered with the Fiesta Bowl media committee for years along with one of the owners of the restuarant and know how hard they work to ensure the best experience for customers and best support of their community. Just look at the photos and honors on their lobby walls!    BTW, they do a lot of fundraisers, and I hope you might be interested in chowing down on a Chimichanga today...to support Cystic Fibrosis. See info below.   VALLE LUNA TO HOST FUNDRAISER   MONDAY, OCT. 13 TO BENEFIT CYSTIC FYBROSIS    WHAT:        All three locations of Valle Luna Mexican Food & Cantinas will host a fundraiser to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  One dollar from each chimichanga dinner ordered that day will be donated to the organization.                     WHEN:         Monday, October 13, 2008 11 a.m. - 9:30 p.m.  WHERE:      All three Valle Luna restaurant locations:  Phoenix:  3336 W. Bell Road, (602) 993-3108   Paradise Valley: 16048 N. Cave Creek Road, (602) 867-9100  Chandler: 1949 W. Ray Road, 480-786-3100   WHY:         For more than 25 years, the owners of Valle Luna Mexican Food & Cantinas have believed that you should always give back to the community. According to Bill Riddle, giving back to the community has been something the family has done since the first restaurant opened in 1983.  You can tell by the lobby \"walls of fame\" that grace each location and include numerous youth sponsorship plaques. In addition Valle Luna has continually supported the many private, non-profit organizations, church groups, educational institutions and sports-related groups in their fundraising endeavors.  Gift certificates are sent out on a regular monthly basis to support their efforts.  To date, more than 6,200 organizations and groups have benefited from Valle Luna's community efforts.      The Riddles also believe that volunteering is another important aspect of giving back.  Both Bill and Janie are active in chamber of commerce organizations (Phoenix, Chandler and North Valley Chamber (formerly Paradise Valley - where Janie was President), Fiesta Bowl, ASU and ASU West (Janie served as Dean's Advisory Board member for the College of Teacher Education and Leadership, National Football Foundation/Valley of the Sun Chapter (Janie is current President and Bill, President Emeritus).  They also serve on the Arizona Licensed Beverage Assoc Board (both) and members of the Arizona Restaurant Assoc."}
{"text":"OK, if you are expecting authentic Mexican food you will be disappointed. The good points: The restaurant is very clean, nice atmosphere and a nice place to bring a date. Our server, Paul, provided  efficient, quick, polite and overall excellent service during a busy Sunday lunch rush. Cheap drink specials. I had a $4 Bloody Mary that wasn't bad at all. My friend had a frozen Margarita but I am unsure of the price. The not so good points: I ordered the grilled Corvina Sea Bass with lime cream sauce, grilled vegetables and Spanish rice. The fish was overcooked, dry and the serving was SMALL.  The lime cream sauce was very good but was buried under a mound of the grilled vegetables and I had eaten all of the fish before I discovered that it was even there. The grilled veggies were actually quite good and the serving was rather large. More fish and less veggies would have been nice. The Spanish rice was nothing special but ok. My friend had a veggie wrap which she enjoyed. We shared the house flan for dessert which was also not bad but had a different flavor neither of us could put a finger on. Overall not a bad place to meet for a meal but certainly not memorable or authentic."}
{"text":"Careful there pulling a fast one on there coupons now. There dated to end middle of month! Never was like that before. Food is OK"}
{"text":"Great customer service from our waiter Cody this evening. Thank you for your awesome attitude and outstanding service. The food was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"First time there. Walked in and was waiting by for a tour guide to show us which way to go. Felt like we were in the movie labyrinth. Asked to be sat in the bar. The smoke was so bad from the outside we couldn't handle it. Went back to the hostess stand and asked to be seated else where.  Our server was GREAT. Explained the menu and was very enthusiastic about it.  Manager came around the corner and said who sat you here? Ummmm, a chick from the stand. Well we are sorry, we need to move you, a party of 15 has reserved this table. No problem. We will give you a free cheese crisp for the inconvenience. SCORE! Got our food! It was okay. The place is very chaotic!!! Like a haunted tour. Just waiting for a mom to jump out and smack someone else besides her own kids who are stabbing each other with forks. Yes, we had a ring side view! Got a coupon from an email. Our server was so \"deflated\" that we first Had a coupon and second didn't print it out. \"We will honor it for you this time, but next time...\" Long story boring, we will not be back.  If you want dinner and a show you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of people on here saying it isn't as good as it use to be. Went on Cinco De Mayo. There was a ton of people waiting. My parents had to park two blocks away. The food was good, it's been better. My fav is the chips! The waitresses are always great. Katie is my favorite. I will continue to support this local business."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever! My husband and I grew up by Luna and have been coming here forever (he has been coming since he was a little kid, me since about 16).    They have a great bar & happy hour. My favorite thing is the happy hour Mexican pizza (sub black beans for the meat). NFL Sundays and Sunday Fundays are also a favorite. They also have Wednesday Family Night and other specials. The staff (especially in the bar!) is fabulous and always make us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"ugHHhhhhh just had the spinach enchiladas and some really good maragaritas and I'm so satisfied. If you don't like spinach, their flautas are pretty O worthy. Anyways I could walk to this place, but being on the broke side a little can't afford to eat here too much SOOOOO THANK GOD FOR THEIR BUY ONE GET ONE 1/2 OFF....I went through like a ton of new times and ripped out some of them lol.   Was there last thursday for my birthday. My friend and I drank all day at work and rolled in around 8 and sat at the bar...filled up on chips and salsa(which are yummy) had peach margaritas and ordered food to-go for a little later when we'd be craving it. Bartender was way cool, bought us some shots for my birthday. Had a thing called a DOgma which I regret because I felt it bad the next day. OOOO how i regret it :)"}
{"text":"The food is really bland. There was great service. I had ordered the Bravisimo Burro and got only meat not what it said on the menu which had sounded good. The potato skins had CANNED jalepeños that have been sitting out and the root of a green onion. And we got green chili enchiladas they were gooey and flavorless, the beans and rice were dry like they were put in the microwave for two minutes. The Pollitos were too thin, over cooked with extreme dark brown. We got a lot of Picante sauce from them, guessing to cover up the horrid taste. We ended up feeding this to our dogs"}
{"text":"Have been eating there for a long time and suddenly on the fajitas there serving way to many onions."}
{"text":"I came to Arizona to visit my family, it was my first time here and first time out and about. So we stopped in here to get some lunch and watch NCAA Basketball finals. The drinks were good. Service was friendly. Didnt really care for the chips and salsa though. I forgot what dish I had but its a local favorite (it says that on the menu) But its a flour tortilla with your choice of meat (I had Chicken, would have been better with shredded chicken) and cream cheese and deep fried. Not healthy by any means but so delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant for about, 15 years I think! I highly suggest the fundido! A lot of Mexican restaurants now a days are getting rid of the complimentary chips and salsa and I'm happy Valle Luna never has because it's sooo good!!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded. Love the food and the bar. Great place for happy hour. But lately can even get in the bar. As people sit at the bar and surrounding tables to eat sit down dinners no beer drinks etc. it shuns me as drinkers who want to sit at the bar for drinks. People go on a waitlist for restaurant and then find a table at bar and sit and have a full sit down dinner no drinks. Great food love it. But try not to make this my first choice."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing I had really stood out. (chicken chimi meal)  Went here because of the 2/1 coupon I had.  Food was heavy and well portioned.   Service was a little slow but it was Saturday around lunch time.  Place is dark and had a funky vibe for a Mexican place.  Music in the background sounded top 100 of the pop list which I wasn't expecting.  Margarita was good for a hot day.  Read about happy hour specials, I might hit the place up for some of that instead of a full meal next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great drink deals. A must for every Phoenician."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I just love Valle Luna.  I am probably being generous with the stars, but over the years it has never let me down for a tasty Mexican meal.  It's casual dining and the bar is pretty fun to grab a bite on the weekends. This will always be an old stand by for me.   Okay, so I do have to mention one negative.  On my last visit the waiter was actually text messaging at the table!  It was weird to try and talk to a waiter while he was text messaging, not to mention that when he walked up to the table he greeted us with \"Oh, shit...hi.\"  Since this is the only time I've experienced bad service, I am not too worried.  Actually, it was more funny than it was bad."}
{"text":"This is a very popular neighborhood mexican restaurant that the locals love.  We really like the food here, and have found a couple entrees that are our go to orders.  They have really good happy hour specials, so it's fun to drop by afterwork for a drink and dinner.  My only issue is the bar is always very noisy - it's hard to be there with a group of friends or a date of two and get in any good conversation.  Parking is tough there but I would recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food for sure! All the employees are friendly and the food is always good! The GM Kelly is AMAZING! Josh the bartender is such a peach. Spinach con queso and pollo fajitas are the best!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the waitress took another tables order seated after my party was seated first, we ordered our food and we specifically asked for shredded BEEF tacos in our taco platter and she brings our chicken tacos.. also she did not come for refills until after we were done with our food. Same customer at a table over ordered steak and shrimp fajitas, instead she comes out with steak and pork fajitas! Along with much food being unsalted and tasting dull, no one should ever have to put salt on their Mexican food, but unfortunately today I had to. Highly do not recommend this place, I guess I gave them one star because I felt bad for them. Go to the Cave Creek or Chandler location, way way better, or go to Popos Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"The place was totally packed.  I mean packed. It was Family Night.    The service was very prompt. When we went in  we were told 15-20 minute wait. We were in seated in ten.  Pretty impressive  The decor is rathe dated, but that adds to the family charm  The chips and salsa was just okay. I thought the chips were a little greasy. A couple chips and I was done   The beef tacos, considering the price point, were pretty good. The actual taco shell while a little greasy was not at all thick. The lightness of the shell outweighed the slight greasy feeling   I would describe this as Spanglish Mexican      Great place to take a kids sporting team"}
{"text":"My bf and I got really bad food poisoning and we were very sad because we ate here at least twice a month. All we got were the bandito burros with bean. Jalepeno cream cheese and guac on the side.  A cheese crisp with veggies on it.  Nothing else and boom both of us were sick af. So someone cross contaminated it and got us sick. Be careful with eating out. That can happen."}
{"text":"The mini taco were good.  The bartender (young lady with long dark hair) was VERY friendly and attentive.  She had a great attitude and a big smile the entire time."}
{"text":"Gross.  Wife didn't even bother to take left-overs.  Place does not look clean.  A warning sign for us should have been that this \"mexican\" place is staffed with gringo servers.  Every quesadilla we ordered arrived soggy, not a single item we ordered was crisp.   Margarita was one of the worst we've had in the north valley (which is really saying something).  Kids seats had broken seat belts.  All of this is sad because we had high hopes for this place especially after reading the positive reviews.  Not mexican, but infinitely better is Mi Comida at 43rd Ave & Bell."}
{"text":"We've been going to this Valle Luna for years, the food and service has always been good. Since the \"thank god\" no smoking laws, it's been enjoyable in the bar area, my wife has breathing problems. We went there on Monday 1/23/17 around 3pm about 4pm a ignorant off duty female employee setting at the bar inside with other co-workers started smoking her e-cigarette, blowing the crap in our direction.   We asked the bartender about this, he said as far as Valle Luna is concerned it's not a law and ok with them. FYI, it's been a proven fact that e-cigarettes put out dangerous vapors. Since the no-smoking laws went into effect we have never experienced such ignorance and dis-respect for paying customers spending money to dine and drink in a restaurant/bar. Employees should set proper examples, but at Valle Luna this doesn't happen, i guess these employees could be considered dive bar employees. The bartender said most dive bars allow e-cigarettes, we dis-agree, we eat out 5-7 days a week a few of them are dive bars. We even expressed our concern to a manager when we left shortly after we was informed that this is allowed inside. We finished up our evening at another dive bar that does NOT allow any type of smoking inside. I'm guessing the owner appreciates and accepts being labeled a lower class dive bar category by his own employees. We're no longer going to go to this dive bar/restaurant anymore. Sure they have great deals especially for us seniors, but our health is more important than saving a few bucks especially at a place that allows e-cigarette smoking inside."}
{"text":"I've always loved eating at Valle Luna because of the food and the specials they have throughout the week. We recently purchased food from them for a party of 40 people. It was an ultimate party platter the cheese enchilada casserole. Their food purchased in bulk is just as good as in the restaurant on a single plate, they don't cut corners and slap something together fast just because it is a large order. We had 40 mini tacos on the platter and each one looked as it had been topped by hand, rather than just handfuls of toppings thrown at the plate.  The price was also very reasonable, if you've ever bought food for large amounts of people from a restaurant, then you'll see a great value in getting the food for less than $5 per person."}
{"text":"POLLO FUNDIDO!!! Always delicious and shareable. The hot salsa and bandito burros are amazing too. Valle Luna has a great happy hour with a big selection to choose from. Food is great so expect it to be busy certain nights. They have an amazing loyal staff. I love to support local business and valley Luna is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food."}
{"text":"GROSS AND DISGUSTING- what happened? I used to live in area and the food was really good.  Now it smells in there like damp and sewer and the furniture and carpet are dated. The food is nasty! Tortilla chips are over cooked. POLLO FUNDIDO is supposed to be shredded chicken crispy tortilla and cream cheese.  we got greasy stewed chicken meat, soggy tortilla, a smear of cream cheese. I asked the server why my fundido wasn't crispy and she told me that the cheese makes it soggy! Obviously she's never had a decent fundido - only the garbage they serv there. and when I asked for more cream cheese they charged me for it. Next time I want pollo fundido ill go to carlos obrians. But ill never go back to valle luna on cave creek, so disappointing and not worth the $32 we spent on 2 lunch entrees."}
{"text":"Four stars?? I think not.   The lovely had lunch here previously, said it was good. We went for an early dinner.   The decor is old and walking in it was damp and smelled like someone's basement. The whole feel of the place is dark and damp and sorry, not clean. Yeah, like gum under the table not clean.  Nice waitress takes our drink order and comes back with yummy chips and salsa. This was the highlight of the meal. Not wanting a carbo load, I order a breakfast burro with chorizio [menu says, egg, cheese, chorizo]. I get a very nice tortilla loaded to the gills with chorizo, couldn't find the egg or the cheese. WTF?? It wasn't even delish chorizo but since I was famished, I ate a third and pushed the plate away. Lovely had chicken taco platter. He ate one and said it was bad, it had no taste. He pushed his plate aside with the remainder untouched. Waitress asked what was wrong and he told her and then she asked me. I told her it was just okay. To their credit, they took Jeff's food off the bill. Damage already done. Awful. Will not go back. E v e r."}
{"text":"Server was fine, but the food was the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. I usually love Mexican food, but this was a poor excuse for a meal."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Valle Luna for many years and has never once had a bad experience.  Most recently we drove 30-40 minutes to eat dinner there with our kids and some other family.  The wait is long but that's to be expected... They're popular!  We were given amazing service by an older server and come to find out, this server has worked there for a very long time.  In the restaurant business, it's rare to see someone stay at one place for a long time so we were impressed.  Food was as great as always!  Order their pollo fundido.  Yummmmy!"}
{"text":"Visit this place. The ambiance was great. The service was courteous and on game. I had the chimichanga shredded beef, and my wife had the Sonoran enchiladas. The shredded beef chimi was tender juicy delicious so far the best in my opinion here Arizona. My wife Sonoran enchiladas were also delicious just the right thickness and texture. The rice and beans were also awesome.. The staff was very attentive which just added to the great time . The beer was cold another plus. I will definitely be back again in the near future.."}
{"text":"Came here with a gift certificate and got A LOT of food!  We knew we must be in for something good because there was a decent crowd waiting and by the time we left there was a large crowd.    We ordered the mini taco basket.... my husband and I split it.  The taco basket alone could have filled us up, yummy fried goodness.  I ordered the enchilada and taco combo and my hubby got an asada burrito.  We are so full of awesome authentic Mexican food I don't think we'll need to eat tomorrow.    Service was good, we got refills on our drinks before they were half empty and the food was GOOD!  This is the first actually totally authentic Mexican restaurant that I have found in Phoenix.  Yay :)"}
{"text":"First time at this Valle Luna but have been to the Chandler location several times.   We arrived at 11:45 for lunch on a Wednesday and waited about five mins to be seated. The decor looked updated but they went for a dark look with table lights. A bit gloomy.   Our server, Claire, was efficient in bringing us menus and drinks. My coworker ordered the Sizzling Steak and Shrimp Fajitas and a coke while I ordered the Burro de la Casa with an iced tea. My meal came out in about 10 minutes along with his condiments but his sizzling platter took about five more mins, so I finished way early.   The fajitas were tender and flavorful but the amount of onions was overwhelming and he ended up picking thru them to look for protein. My burro was nicely made (I got Machaca) and the sauce was nicely spiced. The meat was tender, juicy and fulfilling.   The only downside was at the end of our meal - she disappeared and we waited quite a while for our check."}
{"text":"Oh oh.......... What the heck happened? Been a customer of the Luna for as long as I can remember.  Went there yesterday with my daughter and niece who was visiting from out of town. For lunch I asked if they could incorporate some shrimp into my dish.  Server went and asked and said no.  Hmmmmm really, willing to pay a little something extra for a few shrimp, but the answer was still no. I guess they lost their flexibility to satisfy the customer.  Asked for the manager (Kelly), and she said the shrimp came pre packaged.  WHAT? Pre packaged individual servings at my favorite Mex restaurant? And would not open one ?   I asked how much for a serving and the manager (Kelly) had no idea? WHAT a manager who could not tell me how much an item was on the menu.  Bottom line, no shrimp, crappy service, manager could care less about a long time returning customer. She (Kelly) walked away from the table without a resolution. No more visits to the cave creek location for me. Ugghhhhhh showed my niece what western hospitality was for sure.  Thanks Kelly!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good, good service.  Immature girls at the front desk are rude and nearly caused us to leave.  They need to be more aware of the first impressions or they will lose customers."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Valle Luna since we moved to AZ in 1991. My children were babies, now they have babies of their own that also enjoy eating here. Good food, good. Old memories and more good memories to come"}
{"text":"The food is always good here. The service is always excellent especially considering they are always busy! That is a very good indicator of almost any business :) Pricing and consistently delicious food make them a slam dunk. I have frequented them for years and have it on good authority the owners are lovely amazing people who understand rewarding hard work and loyalty :)) TWO BIG THUMBS UP \"LA LUNA\"!!! You can trust me I'm in the business ;D"}
{"text":"Food is very good, just about everything on the menu is good. The fundito is awesome and highly recommend this item.Thin, crispy chips and salsa arrive just as soon as you sit. Great family atmosphere, and reasonable prices, and good service. Oh and save room for fried ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Our family always love coming here,the hospitality is awesome The food is never a disappointment. The environment is clean and friendly.   Fri June 8,2018 Tonight our server was Jacob G, He did a very wonderful job. Very courteous, understanding most of all Professional. We just want to say, \"We are satisfied, and very thankful for your service. You are the Best! Keep up the good work Jacob G.\""}
{"text":"Interesting contrast found here:  excellent abundant authentic (well to my American palate) Sonoran-style Mexican food but in the setting of a semi trashy beer hall!  Had a hard overworked server who kept things going in the dim, neon beer-sign lit darkness.  Looking at the website the chain (3 total) has pretty high accolades (Best of Phoenix 2009 by the New York Times), just interesting that the decor doesn't match, although perhaps I am being snooty and should just relax and have a good ole time, which is what the place seems to be trying to say.  Great food for great prices, can't beat that in the end."}
{"text":"I understand why this place was so busy, not only was it senior night (over 50 years of age), but there were so many big parties for a Tuesday night.  The food was very tasty.  We had a rather large party of about 10 and the server was great.  She kept our drinks refilled as well as chips and salsa.  Food came out timely and she was quite attentive.  She remembered everyone's order and it was correct.  I usually go to the one in Chandler, (which I love), but will remember this place and come back again.  The only issue was lack of available parking.  I know it's an older area but parking was bad and some people had to park on the street just to get to the restaurant.  Don't let that deter you, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty good. But don't go at lunch. The meat used on the lunch menu seems to be a much lower quality. We love the dinner menu but the lunch menu is below mediocre. Gave my wife horrible stomach pains as well. Again, that's just the lunch menu. Dinner menu is very good"}
{"text":"Five stars for the Sonoran enchiladas!!  It's too hard to find this dish, even so close to the Sonoran desert, and Luna does it very well.  Terrific salsa and great sides as well.  Muy damn bueno.  But.... the margs are pretty bad.  Watery and lame.  Brother warned us, so we went for the top shelf, and even those sucked.  It's not a margarita if you don't taste tequila and lime.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"Parking lot was full. Thought this is good sign, WRONG. Everyone was using a buy one get one free coupon.  The least flavor of any Mexican food I have ever tasted. They are so busy and so fast to bring out food that they forget about flavor. Bland, did I say Bland? Entered and was told it would be 20-30 mins for two persons. Went to bar area, another sports bar with loud and I mean loud TV's. Are you a restaurant or a sports bar. Two dinners with Taco's. enchiladas, rice and beans. No flavor, No taste NOTHING. Even the cheese crisp was fair. Thanks but no thanks. Back to Carolina's !!!"}
{"text":"I still love Valle Luna and usually make it there at least once a month. Their mexican pizza is HUGE and tastes amazing. And it's almost better the morning after re-heated.   It may not be fancy, but they are obviously doing something right- the place is always packed, and I'm a devout fan!"}
{"text":"I think if you grew up in north Phoenix you automatically love this place - like Peter Piper Pizza. Now that I am a grown up and have found all the amazing Mexican restaurants in town, i think this place is garbage. The shrimp tacos were awful. The only reason I give it a 2 star is because the girl that waited on us was fantastic and sometimes that makes the experience."}
{"text":"Sat in the cantina and ordered margaritas and appetizers.  Asked server for another round that he failed to put into system.  Had to flag down what appeared to be a manager,Stephanie, who had been leaning on the bar chewing her gum, to get another drink because the server was overwhelmed and to check on our food. We ordered Vallitos y livitas.  First set was cold and bean dip looked like it had been sitting for a long time.  It was supposed to be a variety of fillings.  The second set was hot, but all filled with beans which my husband hates.  Took another 10 minutes to get servers attention to try and fix. Not worth our time anymore.  Overall doesn't really rate 1 star, but we can't give a zero."}
{"text":"I don't dine at this particular Valle Luna enough because of it's location -- it's far North from where I live. My best friend lives in the area and decided to treat her here since she had never been. She and I were not disappointed. I'm all about the dips and chips. She had one of their more popular entrees and loved it. Their desserts are just as incredible. Service continues to be exceptional. I'll have to venture here more often. It may be an older restaurant but it's still one of the best places for Mexican food here in the Valley. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I don't think the sassy waitress with the dyed black bun of hair loved that I was speaking to her in Spanish when I ordered. Ugh. Someone who thinks they speak Spanish! Uh, I do speak Spanish and you keep responding to me in English. Why are you doing this? I'm just telling you I want the machaca enchilada and the pork tamal combo plate.   I am also curious about the advertised prickly pear margarita. I ask you if its good, and what it tastes like. OK, so you hate my questions, just smile at me please.  So my friend ordered the fundido special, which was a pile of food and then a mess of cheese sauce served on top. Seriously? He's a gringo and he liked it. Oh well.  My combo plate was just OK, nothing really to write home about. Melted cheese has a way of just looking messy and greasy especially when the plate has just been pulled from the microwave. Nothing all that spicy since that would make the gringos skittish.  The prickly pear margarita? Decent but really kind of sweet and pinkish. Apparently this is a very popular place what with the fact that almost every parking place was taken."}
{"text":"I guess you'd like this place, if you have been eating here since you were a child or have never had legitimate mexican food... We have both eaten in once and ordered take out food. Both times the food was \"eh okay\", service has been fine and price point is appropriate. Really not a fan of the salsa, but it seems to be an \"Arizona\" thing. We moved here from Texas so maybe its just preference.   My biggest complaint is the place is SOOO DIRTY! I really think that the carpets, booths, pictures on the walls, everything, has been in place since the late 70's. I understand the economy and that shutting down the place for a week or two to replace everything would have a tremendous financial impact on the staff, but come on! An overnight deep clean that included the walls and carpets would seriously do this place some good! I can't even imagine, nor do I want to, what the kitchen must look like. Take the 1977 little league boy's team pictures down, scrub it all, and if you must, put it back up. Its so dimly lit in there, I imagine it looks ten times worse in the light..."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure service is as important as the quality of the food so I highly recommend the server we always request. Her name is Irene. She is the best.  The food is consistently good. We've been there as a couple or as a family. Five stars."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is a place I've driven past for months but never made it in.  A coworker suggested it for lunch the other day so I finally got to check it out.  The service was good, the chips and salsa were plentiful.  The lunch menu was limited, as well as a little pricey, but the portions were pretty comparable to the price."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty dang delicious.  It tastes like something that I would make at home, and I am a dang good cook!!  The boyfriend took me here on date night last night and for 7:30pm on a Friday, we only waited for about 10 min for a table.  You can make a reservation if you have 8 or more people (FYI).  I ordered a margarita on the rocks and it wasn't too bad.  The chimichanga was really really good!!  I branched out from enchiladas and I wasn't disappointed.  Next time I want to try their tamales.  Our waiter was great.  He wasn't super chirpy and annoying (don't get me wrong- I love nice people but the super peppy dutch brother workers are the only ones that don't make me cringe) and he got everything right.  Very pleasant!! Their salsa is my favorite.  I love cilantro and theirs has a perfect amount!!   I really couldn't have asked for a better night or better service."}
{"text":"First of all, this restaurant has been around for many years. If you're looking for a family and sit down Mexican restaurant, Valle Luna is a great choice. They have a huge menu with a large variety of options, from Chile rellenos,  to enchiladas & tacos - they have it all. Their raspberry margarita was amazing! Good service. Ps The Mexican pizza is amazing! No room for dessert :("}
{"text":"We came here tonight (Sunday) at 5:30pm. Parking lot was near full, which to me is a great sign of a good restaurant. I walked in expecting slow drinks and food but was very happily surprised at how fast and friendly service was. Food was good, drinks were good, and no wait time for either of them. Our server was really friendly and when we had asked someone (I'm not sure if he was a bus boy or a runner- he was serving everyone chips and salsa) for a to go container for our salsa to bring home, he happily offered to give us a whole batch of fresh stuff to bring home and it was a healthy amount! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Worst service worst food ever you call yourself a restaurant almost compares to eating out of a garbage can and our server told us under his breath to go to hell when we asked about food quality ... I wish I knew his name"}
{"text":"Have eaten there multiple times. Food is hit and miss, mostly hit. Nothing on the menu was particularly remarkable.  Average \"Mexican\" food. Have never had an issue with the servers,  prompt and attentive. Can get really busy at dinner time so prepare for a wait."}
{"text":"I forget about this place but when I end up there I always enjoy it and have a great meal. Went there with a friend last week. Service was good and refills flowed. They also regressed the salsas which is always appreciated. Had the combo with tamale and enchilada. Tasty for sure. Took some take home for the rest of the family and the server also made sure we packed up the leftovers. I will remember that I want to return. Nice family place."}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I recently went to Valle for dinner.  I was looking forward to enjoying some good Mexican having recently moved back to AZ.  Everything started off well.  Our server seemed nice, and he brought a lemon for my water, which if you have read my reviews, is kind of important to me.  The chips and salsa were pretty good as well.  But then... I will have to say I've had better Mexican food at a fast food chain like Chipotle.  I ordered the steak and chicken fajitas.  Our food took at least half an hour, if not more, to arrive.  The place was busy, but by no means slammed.  I could barely differentiate the steak from the chicken, which is really weird.  My plate that contained my guac, sour cream, and shredded cheese seemed like it had been prepared and then set under a heat lamp waiting for the other food to finish being prepared.  My \"shredded\" cheese was melted together and in a clump, very unappealing.  The worst part of my experience was we were sitting at a small table in the bar area.  When we were finished w/ small plates and such, I moved and placed them on two occasions to the bar area where I thought it would be easily grabbed by the staff so we could have room on our small table.  The second time, the bartender basically reprimanded me and said w/ an annoyed attitude, Hey man your server will get those for you.  I don't want them up here.  How freaking rude.  I could possibly understand if he was busy, but he only had 2 patrons sitting at the bar in our section.  I can deal w/ poor food quality ever now and then.  What I can't tolerate is RUDENESS.  I took over half my food to go bc I hate wasting food, but couldn't even bring myself to eat it later so the trash got some sub par Mexican.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment.  The only reason Valle gets 2 stars instead of 1 is bc both my friends enjoyed their dishes.  Maybe I should have ordered what they had, but if a Mexican place can't do fajitas right, to me that's a pretty good indication of the overall food quality.  Patronize at your own risk."}
{"text":"Ate their Saturday evening and very disappointed as we have ate there for many years.  Both the beans & rice that came with out meals were extremely salty.  Told the waitress about it and a side of rice was brought out but it to was extremely salty.  We had ordered a green chile chicken burrito and it was just large dry pieces of chkn in a tortilla w a little bland green chili sauce pored over it.  Must be a new cook."}
{"text":"Awesome enchiladas.. yummy beanhood.. best salsa that Ive found outside of New Mexico.. Luna your a 4:-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great chips and salsa. Really good food and the staff is great. It's always a good sign when you see lots of regulars."}
{"text":"Good food, with all the people standing out front we didn't think we'd get a table but they took our party of two right away. Not the cleanest restaurant but I've seen worse."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to Valle Luna for a few years now. Mostly because it is close to home and they have their bogo coupons. However, their service, food quality and value have gone down quite a bit. We keep giving it a chance, but find the same disappointment. We have opted for Top Shelf in Phx.  I like the ground beef chimi, but they are so greasy I have sent many back. I was told that you have to tell the wait person that you want the meat drained. Why would a person have to do that?  Who would want it greasy?  I agree with a lot of the reviews when they say that the salsa tastes store bought. They put red enchilada sauce on the chimi that tastes like they opened a can of Campbell's tomato soup and poured it on top.  The temperature of the food is room temp at best. The prices, even with bogo are pretty high for the quality of the food. The atmosphere is loud and not a relaxing experience. Yet, they are always busy. I can't figure out why.  Back to Top Shelf for us, even though they are further away."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and great service! I highly recommend Valle Luna!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this restaurant back in the day when I used to go Paintballing with my team just 5 miles north of here.  The food used to always be fresh and consistently delicious. And the service was always prompt and friendly.  After not having dined here for many years, we happened to be driving by and opted to stop and see how they were nowadays.  First of all, the service was extremely slow. Not sure if it was simply because they were short handed, or if there were just so many holiday patrons. But, after waiting for nearly 15 minutes for our waiter to come and acknowledge our presence, and take our drink order - we were about ready to just pay for the chips and salsa and walk out.  Speaking of the chips and salsa, they were still as delightful as we remembers. And they were at least promptly deposited in our table upon being seated. But, that was the extent of any timely service that we received.  I ordered the Grilled Carne Asada Red Chile Burro, and had a side of the classic Machaca Taco (their specialty). My wife had the Taco / Tamale / Enchilada Combo.  I am not sure what was going on in the kitchen that day, but our the cook should've toned down on the spices. It tasted like the red chile powder exploded onto our meals because they weren't just mildly spicy - they were extremely spicy!  And to top it all off, the meat on my Machaca taco was burned. It was so burned that it was crispy.  Speaking of burned, the topping on our Flan tasted of burnt sugar.   I am not sure what happened to this place, but it has definitely spiraled downward in the many areas that it used to excel in!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!  The staff seem like they are one big family, which I guess you might consider them as one considering some of them have been here for 20+ years, which speaks volumes of management and the way they run things.  Service is always great, food is never disappointing, and their specials are the best.  The only complaint would be parking.... it doesn't matter what day or time you come here, it's almost impossible to find a place to park. This isn't because they dont accommodate for the size, it's because this place is always packed, which is a good thing!!!"}
{"text":"Well I would not say it is all bad but its not great. The tacos are good and I loved the beans."}
{"text":"Don't order the beef fajitas because it's like ordering onion fajitas 2 slivers of beef that amounted to 2 teaspoons. I felt like I was on nutrisystem.  They gave you  2 small flour tortillas and 2 corn tortillas and what was with the stewed tomatoes they could lose the stewed tomatoes...Food was awful. They need to learn how to cook!!!! They need someone that knows how to cook. This item was suppose to feed two people where it wouldn't feed one. I was disgusted at the way it tasted no meat. I was wondering if the chef in the back  got hungry and ate all the meat off our plate. I felt cheated and so completely ripped off. I won't be back. If a food critic came in there and ordered that he would of sent it back and would of told them I didn't order onion fajitas!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Service, not so much. Would have given 5 stars, but the service here on Sunday Oct 29th was pitiful! I literally have never had such poor service anywhere while sitting at the bar. Please scheduele your bar with more people! I am more understanding if there is an apology, or I can see that they are getting killed back there. But from start to finish, it was awful! The house margaritas were awful and tasted like the sour mix was out of syrup or something. All I could smell was sanitizer while drinking it (not a chance sending it back, since it took us 30min to get noticed again to order food) and there was something black in my marg (fished it out). Would have ordered something else, but it was impossible to get service. Needed a hair of the dog STAT so we drank them anyway. Notfied a guy who looked like a manager, and he just stared at us. Not even an  apology lol. I was with 2 other people to have dinner, but the bartender only took my food order after finally getting his attention. Sat with empty drinks for too long, as well did other people next to us. Waited at least 10 minutes to get my friends food order in too..my food took at least 30 minutes to arrive. I was there for two hours for dinner! I was annoyed because i had to get somewhere before they closed. They forgot to bring me a side of beans, but it wasn't on the bill, it was completely forgotten. Didn't ask if we wanted separate bills (all arrived separately), took way too long to do anything so forget asking! When we get the check, the bartender finally lightens up a little and becomes playful-sarcastic. In the most inappropriate way! I tell him I have to leave in a hurry and he proceeds to tell me to \"get out, leave\" several times! Like WTF? We were super cool to him the whole time, and had a good time, despite the shit service..but this just made it awkward. I didn't think it was funny. Maybe next time I'll sit at a table LOL"}
{"text":"Best pollo fundido and margaritas I have had in ages! I had given up on finding a good margarita. They were good enough to go for the pitcher. Thankfully,  I wasn't driving. The food was incredible. I plan on going back here everytime I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ordered pork tacos, cost around $12. Cold, tasted like Taco Bell, not good quality food. I think they pre-make the food, the tacos were wrapped in foil. I didn't eat it."}
{"text":"Our family loves eating here!  Great chips, salsa, pollo fundido is to die for, and awesome fajitas.  The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the inconsistent service.  Most times it is great, and the food always comes out fast, but when you get a slow server it is going to be really bad. I can excuse it when the place is busy or when someone tells us they are new, but lazy doesnt deserve a 20% tip, and when we have complained about the service we seem to get a brush off from managers. BUT, 90% of the time it is a good experience."}
{"text":"If you want store brand, cheap salsa to go along with the rest of your bland food, this is the place to go!  We live fairly close to this location and have heard mixed reviews, some have explained the horrible things it will do to your stomach while some have said it's the best in the valley.   We came in for dinner last weekend to give it a try. Boy were we disappointed...  First off, the salsa tastes good but if I wanted store bought salsa, I would stop at Fry's and pick some up on my way home. When I go out to eat at a Mexican restaurant I expect they aren't opening a jar of Pace and dumping it into a bowl.   I ordered the taco salad with shredded chicken. While there was a lot of chicken, I couldn't believe they used bagged lettuce with giant chunks of carrots and radishes. At no point does a taco salad recipe call for carrots or radishes. It was a cheap presentation on top of cheap ingredients.   I will say the guacamole was good, I'd love to know what store they buy it from so I can pick some up as well.    We have no desire to be back. If you want some good Mexican food try Don Ruben's on Cactus."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. It has good flavor and was served fast  and hot. Best thing is the Happy hour . Drink price and food is very reasonable . Lots of TV to watch the games and just hang out. Chips and Salsa were fresh.  Staff was friendly and helpful with their recommendations. If in N Phoenix give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a teenager, good food and fast service. Seating is a little tight so hopefully you don't mind hearing your neighbors conversation but it's all good"}
{"text":"This place was  recommended to me.as soo. As we walked in we were seated immediately. I had the Fundido which is on special for $11.95 on Thursdays I ate about 1/2 of it and was stuffed. It was soo good. The rice was amazing as well. I tried to eat as much as possible. The waitress came immediately to the table and was very friendly. I will definitely go back anytime I return to Arizona."}
{"text":"My favorite! Margarita Monday...$ .99 margaritas... Tuesday is sr night.... Great place"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for  34 years, awesome. The greatest asset to this place is Summer. Greatest server we all have ever had. She brings it before I can ask for it!"}
{"text":"Yumtastic! My husband and I love this place. We were so sad when Chevy's closed. We have been trying to find another Mexican food place, we found it. It is better than Chevy's. We have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The prices are reasonable, staff is always friendly, food comes out pretty quickly, hot and fresh. I am pretty particular and have a lot of requests/alterations/substitutions with food dishes, but they always get it right. I love their chips and salsa. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"What makes this place a great place is the buy one get one free coupons.  However, the mexican food itself is average.  They appear to have a great happy hour and other great promotions which makes this place worth coming back too.  Like I mentioned earlier, the food is average but not horrible."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of friends and family after a long day working. The service was fast, the food was good. The prickly pear margarita hit the spot. The staff was very accomidating to my infant, who loved their guacamole. The price was really affordable. I know this place has been here forever, we will be stopping by more often."}
{"text":"It is fabulous at what it is- a delightfully tacky Mexican restaurant with delicious food and friendly service. Watch for the monthly mailers with buy one get one free offers."}
{"text":"NIce place. Food is good and affordable, yet it's nice enough to have a semi-fancy night out at too."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Great food! Great service. Keep in mind that Tuesday night is seniors night so the average age of the guest are around 50 years old. But it was still a fun night. We were here celebrating my friends 40th birthday and even the cute little old men couldn't understand why all of us ladies were not there with any men. We simply stated that is was girls night out! LOL He then proceeded to say well if you ladies change your mind, please come and join me and my friends. Pure comedy indeed! Will I be back? Of course as this as this hasn't been my first visit ( hey I don't always check in lol) but it surely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"I finally tried out Valle Luna on Sunday.  I must say that the food is authentic and one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The salsa and chips are homemade and simply tasty.  I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious.  The waitress that served me was attentive.  I must say that the seating did take a while and I was one of two people in line, hence no five star here.  The portions were decent, the tacos could have had more fish in them.  Overall I am pleased with the restaurant and you will be too."}
{"text":"everything is bigger at valle luna - from the food, to the margaritas served in 19oz mugs, to the menu.  as an indecisive foodie, this is definitely a place where i would study the menu before arriving.  with multiple dining areas, large sized food and drinks, and a colorful decor, valle luna looks like it could be a great place for celebrations.  this was our final stop before taking a red-eye home so we were happy to load up on some comfort food.  the pepe's sizzling fajitas, baja fish tacos, and complimentary chips and salsa did not disappoint.  we were so famished that the waitress even brought us a second serving of chips.  if you order carefully, there are some items suitable for 1 hungry person (i.e., baja fish tacos), but most entrees are large enough for 2 people (i.e., pepe's sizzling fajitas).  the food is average and the A/C is strong for those brutal phoenix summers."}
{"text":"I probably go here at LEAST once a week. Best happy hour - goes until 7:30 - and the food is delicious. I definitely recommend the wings (ask for them grilled)!"}
{"text":"Still the best Mexican food in AZ. Bar None! Been here multiple times and it will continue!"}
{"text":"We eat there tonight.  The chips, not house made, were ok.  The salsa tasted like it was from a jar of Ortega mild, but they did serve a smaller, spicier salsa which we mixed with the milder one.  The carnitas tasted like unseasoned cubes of boiled meat which needed to be trimmed.  The carne asada was similar.  I don't care for the cheese they use - cheddar or gainy American?  Although we think there are better Mexican restaurants in the area, and we won't revisit this business,  it's apparently well liked by others.  It was fairly busy and seems to have a good take-out business.  The waiter was very pleasant, and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least twice a month for the past twenty years and have rarely been disappointed. Excellent enchiladas and cheese crisps and the sopapillas make a great finish to the meal. Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place to dine with family and to feast on basic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best happy hour amazing wings number 1 in phoenix bar service was good even though they were slammed busy great pricing 5.50 for 12 wings yes please happy hour was 3-7 I think but it was so good will be back I don't know why this days they are closed but it was amazing!"}
{"text":"yummy mexican food excellent customer services. I beleive I've been going to Valley Luna for 15+ years.    Big portions, and great lunch specials."}
{"text":"I took 6 friends to Valle Luna Monday night for dinner. All from out of town and only my 2nd time at the restaurant. While the wait was an hour - the food and services was great. The place needs a facelift... lets be honest but the food and services is great.   I highly recommend it. Stephen"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Been coming here for years. The service is normally great.  The food it top notch.  My go to for \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"Look, this is not the most authentic Mexican food you will ever have.  However, if you are looking for reasonably priced, Ameri-Mexican food, you will not be dissappointed.  The tacos are great, the nachos huge, and the service is wonderful usually.  Most of the servers have been there for 5 or more years, so that should tell you a lot!  It is my local \"go to\" place and I will be back for years to come."}
{"text":"Been eating in the various Valle Luna restaurants for pretty much forever. The food is good and reasonably priced. Service is always good as well.  You arent going to go wrong with these guys so if you are in the neighborhood stop in."}
{"text":"Despite my last experience at the Valle Luna on Bell Road, I brought a couple of friends here for dinner last night. I am happy to say that our experience was nearly as good as I have come to expect from this fine restaurant.  It was a Thursday night and the parking lot and lobby were packed. But we were seated very quickly and the service was excellent, as always. Everyone enjoyed their meal, plus it was very reasonable!  The only reason I didn't give the five stars that I know they are worthy of, was the fact that my favorite dish just isn't as good as it use to be. I mistakenly called them \"street tacos\" in my previous review. Pepe's Border Tacos are still delicious, but they just don't pack the flavor I remember. However, I could tell someone listened because the menus have been updated. Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"We have had great food and service every time we have been here. Tonight we have excellent service, we truly appreciate the server's thoughtfulness and care. Great margaritas too!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on with this place. The food used to be pretty good and the service was acceptable. I went today and when the food came it wasn't even hot.  The bowl of Albondigas had only two meatballs and was only lukewarm. My chile relleno was closer to cold that hot, and the sauce was even colder.  There was no way the food was in compliance with health regulations. The service was awful; my water glass was never refilled. To top it off, I was double charged for an item. The serber obviously didn't check the bill for accuracy before giving it to me, or knew it was inaccurate and didn't care.  This place is not inexpensive. In fact, it's among the higher priced Mexican restaurants. My bill was 40 dollars for two people and included only one drink.  I will not go back. I really hate getting overcharged for food and service that is worse than mediocre."}
{"text":"We have a couple of favorite dishes from the Taquito Basket, mixed both beef and chicken. The bean dip is great with the Taquitos. I switch between Combo Numero Uno which has a taco, cheese enchilada and a pork tamale. My other favorite is the Burro de Casa with shredded beef. Both come with refried beans and rice. The burro is served enchilada style. Desert has been so so, but my idea of Mexican desert is a Chi-Chi's fried ice cream and no one does it the same way. Service is hard to predict, often during the lunch hours, we'll get great service, however, just yesterday we waited 15 minutes just to meet our waitress."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  You never really know what you are going to get when trying someplace new.  Valle Luna went beyond our expectations.  From chips and salsa to our actual meals everything was delicious although neither of us was able to finish our meal.  Our only wish was that it was closer to where we live.   We did discover they have another a little closer to home on Bell.  We will try that one next time.  Hopefully the service and food is just as good."}
{"text":"So about a month ago we ate at their Cave Creek location and found it fantastic.  As the location on Bell is actually closer to where we live (still 23 miles away), we decided the next time we would try their Bell location.  Today we finally had a chance and it was worth the drive.   The food as well as the service was actually even better than I remembered it.  I couldn't stop myself from almost finishing the entire meal.  Now it's time for a siesta."}
{"text":"The food was great and well priced. The salsa is very good and the chips were warm. I had a cheese crisp to start and Flautas for dinner! I would suggest both."}
{"text":"Food was great as always.  Grilled steak burro and some tacos always a good call.  Great chips and salsa that are at your table by the time your sitting down.  Service is bland but the food makes up for it.  Great cantina for some drinks too!  Older crowd tho"}
{"text":"200% EXCELLENT food at the Bell Road & 34th Ave location!!! We've been going there a couple years since moving to the west side. They also have a location on Cave Creek Road between Greenway & Bell Roads, not as tasty, way smaller, and a heck-of-a lot more crowded.  Does anyone know about TUESDAY \"Senior\" night??? Order two meals, and two drinks, they'll comp your least expensive meal, as in FREE!!! Shouldn't be advertising, cuz then it's more crowded for me, and I like to eat in a mellow, intimate setting with my man.  GO and enJOY...guarantee you won't go to any other Mexican restaurant, UNLESS it's for something not on the menu!!! Oh yeah---choice of shredded chicken OR beef, hamburger, or machaca (sp?)..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go with my family for some great authentic Mexican food. I have been coming here since I was a kid and have never been disappointed!  The always provide fresh salsa and chips, and the best bean burritos! One thing that can always improve is the service time. They can be a bit quicker on refills on drinks and chips and salsa. Otherwise, great food and service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here pretty often. We absolutely love the fundido sauce, it is sinfully delicious! Love the cantina especially when it's not so busy. The service is usually good and the huge yummy portions are enough to keep us coming back. Love the buy 1 get 1 coupons we get in the mail!"}
{"text":"Fun fact, this was the last meal my mom had before she went into labor with me 29 years ago! Always a family-favorite, this is a go-to spot."}
{"text":"I've almost everything on the menu and you can't go wrong ordering anything here. I am a huge red chile lover and I swear Valle Luna has the best red chile in town! I just recently tried the green chile and that's fabulous too! Now my biggest dilemma is do I go with the red or green chile? First world problems."}
{"text":"Average mexican restuarant which has a lot of retired clients due to specials (buy one get one free) type.  Place is always packed but not because of the food at least for me.  I had their enchilladas and they only make them in red sauce.  My wife had the fish tacos and she liked those.  Would not be returning, there are better authentic places out there. Update: I have to say that the manager reached out to me.  Seems these people care about their customers and for this I will give them another star!"}
{"text":"Customer service is something this establishment can work on.  I called and spoke with Tony about making reservation, he was aloof and not engaged in my call.  The bothersome point was he just hung up on me and did not bother to say good bye or any type of closing...just. Hung. Up."}
{"text":"Valle Luna has a great atmosphere for large groups and families. The bar during happy hour is usually crowded which can be fun if you find a table but I usually end up sitting at the restaurant because the bar is packed. The margaritas are pretty tasty but the restaurant and bar can get a little loud. Great place for a fun atmosphere but not great on weekends if you're looking for a quiet place for a chat. The start of happy hour during the week is the most fun time to go. Plenty of parking and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the service today. We were seated at a table that was so wet, the placemats were damp. When the waitress showed up she placed our silverware down on the still, wet table. I had to ask someone for a refill on my tea. I used a two for one coupon. My mother just wanted an enchilada with a side of beans and rice. That would add up to  about 7 bucks. My coupon had a value of 11 bucks. They could have easily include the beans and rice with my mothers enchilada. But instead they counted it as a separate plate. I know it was only 250 but for principle. They served it all on the same plate. It should have been counted as one. That will be a costly 250. Next time I'm thinking of eating Mexican food. I may decide to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will definitely be back! Our waiter Tom ( I think that was his name) was the best waiter we ever had. He was so on top of everything! Our food was delicious and came out so hot, fresh, and fast! Best chicken chimichanga I ever had. My husband got the beef tacos and loved them as well. We will defiantly be back and be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this restaurant..... In high school 10 years ago.. We recently made a special visit to celebrate a birthday with a party of 13.. When we called to make a reservation, they informed us that they didn't make them.. So we showed up half an hour earlier than we wanted to make sure our party could get a table only to find out that apparently a party that large required a reservation and the wait was over an hour.. When I asked who answered the phones the young idiot lady said it's always different.. I asked her to explain herself about reservations and she sounded like she was high with her explanation of that they sometimes make them and sometimes don't and tonight they had 4 but sometimes don't use them.. I told her she made absolutely no sense at all!!! It was embarrassing to listen to her speak.. Half of out party had arrived by this point and we called Top Shelf down the street and they said they could get us right in so we told them we were leaving and were not happy with their service and they didn't care.. At any rate, we walked in the door at Top Shelf with 13 people (two children) and were seated right away.. Unacceptable.. No matter if their restaurant is always busy or not, this should have been rectified prior to us leaving.."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It's my go to restaurant since La Palmas closed in 2005 (sell out).   The reason I like it is it is almost the same food wise as La Palmas was. I love the cheese enchiladas, though I could do without the olives. Love the machaca tacos (always done right). Red chili burros are excellent. Cheese crisps are really good. Hot and fresh chips. Hot sauce is really good.   The only bad thing about the restaurant is that they do not have a location close to me. So I can't go there as much as I would like.  Service has never been a problem at either of the 2 locations I have been to.  One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something without rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away."}
{"text":"The catering manager Kelly gives OUTSTANDING customer service!  We  recently placed an ordering during the crazy busy holiday season and when we came to pick up, our order was somehow lost, but Kelly didn't miss a beat, she immediately had the kitchen make our order, gave us free chips and salsa and rice and beans and even walked me to my car!  It was amazing to see this amount of great customer service!  And when I arrived back at work to eat our tasty food, we realized she had even give us double what we had originally ordered.  A HUGE thank you to Kelly, she went above and beyond to correct the error and that deserves a giant THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite, and my 5 stars represents that as such.  If you are looking for an old-school Sonoran style Mexican restaurant, with a good assortment of foods on the menu, this is the place.   You will get the good old fashioned, better not be on a diet, combo plates, fried goodies with cheese,  and likely leave with a to-go box.  You will certainly be able to find lighter fare, but we go for that margarita, cheese crisp, and whatever else is looking good that day.  The chips and salsa are amazing.    Incredible happy hour specials- 1/2 price on most appetizers in the bar.  And the bar is very relaxed, sports on TV's, etc.  Food is very reliable, service is familiar, friendly and efficient.    Frequently a wait on Friday nights, so plan your time accordingly."}
{"text":"I have been going to \"The Luna\" for years now and we always love the food. Best Mexican food in the valley.  We had a bit of an issue on friday night, but the Luna came through.  My girlfriend ordered her meal but it came out of the kitchen not as hot as was expected and she asked the waitress to bring it back, which she did immediately.  The manager returned with the meal but it came back wrong, different food. (at least we know they didnt chuck it in the microwave lol).  The dish had to go back again...and my girlfriend was getting a bit upset by now.  Well the manager took care of not only her meal but mine as well!  Excellent customer service!  They are always busy and sometimes mistakes can happen but the food wound up being delicious and we were very satisfied!  We will continue to be loyal patrons!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We love \"The Luna\" as we call it.  The best mexican food in the Valley as far as im concerned.  Whenever we go out to eat the Luna is always on the list.  If you go, try the fundido...so good!  And they make great margaritas! The only problem is that they need a bigger parking lot! Its always so busy!"}
{"text":"Now let me start off by saying the food is great and never disappoints, the reason for the 2 star review is that their service has had several issues over the past few visits me and my wife have made. Between forgetting drinks, entrees coming out before appetizers and just forgetting parts of orders, there are some severe service issues that need to be addressed at this location. I love Valle Luna but the serious service problems that keep happening need to be fixed ASAP."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but Luna has gone downhill. There are 2 reasons you come into this place - Mexican food and to watch events on TV.  For me, the events are usually NFL games.  First off, the quality of the food has decreased significantly.  If you want good Mexican food, there are plenty of places to get it.  Likewise, the service in the cantina is weak.  I came in on a weekday for lunch, and there were not many customers in the cantina.  Still took almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter over, then another 10 to get a soda I had ordered. The table behind me was empty and sat unbussed for the entire 20 minutes, but the busboys walked by several times. I have worked in restaurants and I would have fired them for what I saw...  Once I got the food, it was okay, but I had to wait another 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention to get my check...  Final straw for me was going in today to watch football. I got in early to see where my game was showing.  They have signs on the TVs indicating which games were showing on each TV. Sat so I could see Raiders/Titans and Jags/Ravens. I was told in no uncertain terms that the TVs were not changing, and heard the bartender mention that as well.  But, before the 1st quarter was out, the games changed... So I could not see the games I wanted to see.  Why come here?"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! I also prefer coming here if Ian is working! He's very knowledgeable about the menu, drinks etc!   He's also quite witty and always recommends the best menu options. I come back just for his service.   I usually get two shredded beef tacos and rice/beans. Which is always great! No complaints here."}
{"text":"We love this place! They have a nice happy hours which was better before the prices increased. Love their food, we have been here many times and always leave happy. My BF always gets the fundido(which is deliciously covered in cheese) and I switch it up. The margaritas and beer on tap are a must. The waiters are always super accomidating, wish they would bring back the buy 1 get 1 free :("}
{"text":"To start, this is an Americanized Mexican restaurant, but even for that, it's low. any rating above three stars tells me the rater has really low standards for  food.  ate here on a recommendation but no time to go to a better place. First: chips, good--light &crispy. Waitress, good. Calm, professional, helpful without being intrusive. Salsa--canned, tasted like that stuff made in Noo York City.  albondigas--tasted like Campbell's minestrone soup with meatballs, and too salty.  And they served it with one (big) flour tortilla...really? carne asada was just meh.  beans tased like canned. Drinks? No horchata? Jamaica? really?  There so many places with real Mexican food, there is no reason to patronize this chain of restaurants.  Steer clear."}
{"text":"I always order the valletos y lunitas (i think that's how you spell it) for lunch. It's mini chimi's and the bean dip is great !  I love their HOT salsa. It's not hot at all, it's just more flavorful than the regular salsa they provide."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is my and my family's favorite Mexican restaurant. We have been going there for over ten years.  In fact, my daughter has come to expect to go every Wednesday for dinner for family night (specials).  Not only is the food delicious, GMA is the best waitress. She is very friendly, easy to talk to, and is on top of all of our requests. Just last month, I was trying to surprise my husband with a dessert for his birthday and had to quickly pass on the message (without words) to GMA. She got the message and made sure he was completely surprised by a giant dessert. She is the best!"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations   I am very particular about the places I choose to eat at, I drive most of my friends crazy.  I was apprehensive when  my friends suggested Valle Luna for lunch. I had always seen cupons and  specials but never went there to eat. Finally tried Valle Luna and happily, it exceeded my expectations.   Service was great; chips & drinks were served quickly. The flatas were topped with sour cream, guacamole, and cheese and we're  good, as were the asada tacos. The portions at Valle Luna are generous enough to have a little leftover for the next day.   I was pleasantly surprised at the service, quality, and ample portions. For american style mexican food Valle Luna was good. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with Valle Luna.  I have been going there for years, used to go to the East valley location every week when I lived on that side of town.  Good food, good price!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Valle Luna on Bell rd. We were in the neighborhood of the Cave creek Valle Luna and wanted to try it. I was very disappointed. We waited 15 minutes to sit down, and then walked through a nearly empty restaurant. Didn't receive chips and salsa until a few minutes before the food came out, then the chips were stale. The lemon in my ice tea was dry, like it was cut up days before. My taco salad shell was stale, I upgraded to steak which was chewy and near impossible to eat. The waitress was nice and attentive, but that was the only good part."}
{"text":"Great food, Great weekend prices in the bar on food and drinks! Good service from all employees involved in your dining experience !!!"}
{"text":"We usually hit the Valle Luna about once a week, and have done so for about the past 3 years.  We don't do the restaurant, only the cantina for happy hour and some bar food.  I'm not a big margarita drinker but my wife enjoys them and really likes the \"Big Easy\".  I usually just have beer (Corona, por favor).  Prices are really good.  As far as the bar food goes, it can't be beat for the price.  We usually order a plate (6) of the mini tacos and share them. They're not really mini size and are more than enough for us, especially with the complementary chips and salsa.  Speaking of chips and salsa, first rate.  The chips are always fresh and warm and the salsa is great.  They serve a milder version with green chili, onions and cilantro or a hotter version that is red chili based.  Both are good, but I prefer the hot stuff."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been one of my family favorites for a couple decades now.  They have speedy & appropriate customer service, flavorful food, and multiple different types of atmospheres that fit your needs.  There is the dining area and the indoor/outdoor bar. The bar can get pretty upbeat and busy!  I am pretty sure you have to call a day in advance to make reservations for big parties. I would recommend this, because its typically busy every night of the week.  Their margaritas are, of course, phenomenal."}
{"text":"Best food ever! This is our go to restaurants, I could eat here every day of the week there are so many good items on the menu. First place we take friends and family from out of town and they always love it too. Five stars plus!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I have for a long time. Even now with my dietary restrictions they still have decent choices. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas with no dairy items and no peppers. It was still amazing, the chicken was juicy and spiced just right and the onions....ohhh how I love perfectly carmelized onions. I didnt even want the tortillas, it didn't need it. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The beans could've been a little creamier and fresh tasting, while they weren't horrible, they weren't great. All in all it was a great lunch with plenty to take home. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This location is nothing like the 35th Ave and Bell location, thank God! I ordered the carne asada tacos, one chicken, one steak. Oh my were they fabulous. Both meats were cooked perfectly tender and seasoned. Tortillas were fresh and soft. Beans and rice were a great side, as they each had good flavor. The chips and salsa here are addictive and yummy. Very fresh and flavorful. Service was good and it was extremely busy so brownie points."}
{"text":"One word: disgusting. From the decor to the employees to the food. Yuck. Was dragged here by my husband and will never return."}
{"text":"I emailed this establishment about our experience. I expected a response at the very least an apology.  A week later and clearly they must have enough customers and dont need any new ones.  We wont try them again, not because of the lack luster experience but because the couldn't be bothered to acknowledge a  customer that did the right thing and tried to Let them know what is happening in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning and the place wasn't very busy.   The bar tender was horrible!!   Took awhile to get drinks and asked for extra salsa with our chips, it's been 30 min and still waiting for that extra salsa. Took awhile to order a second drink and I seriously wish I just got up and left before doing so.  Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.  I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left.   Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake."}
{"text":"I don't know what it will take for us to lose faith in this place... We come here every so often when we are not very creative with dinner options... and if it is in a Friday we always hate the limited parking : ( the wait : ( and the so so food.  We had a certificate this time, so it was a hell of a deal. And, our server Charity was outstanding. She was really friendly and helpful.  We ordered the asada/chorizo tacos as appetizer (Pepe's border tacos), they were OK but we didn't love them. The meat/chorizo portion was generous though... and it came with a chile toreado, which I love.  Then we shared sizzling beef fajitas. The beans are so so, and there is something about the rice that I don't like... not sure if it is cumin...   Daughter had shrimp fajitas, which seemed to be just a few shrimp in a sea of onion and peppers, but I still think it was a reasonable portion. At least they don't charge extra if you order shrimp.  I do like how they present the cheese, guacamole and the sour cream in a cute small tortilla shell.  Side note: ***Self fulfilling prophecy? As a working family, we try what we can to make our dollars go further... I use the Entertainment Book, coupons mailed to us, restaurant.com certificates, etc. And one of the reasons I love this (other than the savings) is that it is because of coupons and certificates that we have found wonderful places that we may have not even noticed otherwise. However, sometimes the service is just awful. And I am starting to believe it may be because servers may have the impression that people using coupons are stingy, and bad tippers... however, we are not... we routinely tip 20% or even more if we round up. Unless, of course, the service is terrible... food for thought..."}
{"text":"Worst excuse for mexican food I have had. Any self respecting Mexican should sue them for misrepresentation."}
{"text":"Valley Luna does a great job! it is hard for me to give any Mexican food place 4 stars just based on the food and service but I'm sure that they are out there. I had the steak with my last order and it was very good. Twyla had her Taco Basket complete with her engagement ring placed squarely in the middle. The staff was so awesome in helping me pull off this special moment! Thank you all! It was perfect and she had no idea...  The cocktails rock here and I love to just throw down the House Margaritas. Then menu is contrived with all of the favorites and the desserts rock. My birthday dessert was awesome and they used a burning tortilla chip as my candle. There are two locations that I'm aware of (Bell and 35th) and this location. Both are really good! It was a special moment, so I'm adding a picture of Twylas ring to my photo's. Thank you Valley Luna for being a part of our lives.  #Vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #IrishcatV2"}
{"text":"So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.  They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.    On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.    On the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place."}
{"text":"I created my yelp account just to review this restaurant. I was there last night (Saturday April 11, 2015) and had excellent service from the server, Cody. I am a server myself and think this young kid deserves some recognition. He was fantastic. He was clearly busy with parties and it being a Saturday night but he never showed it. I have not received such great customer service in a while. He was just a delight! The food was great too but honestly I will return just for the wonderful service! Thanks Cody.. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner here on a Monday night to find there was No wait, and we were seated right away. Chips and salsa were good, but I've had better at other places.  I had the steak chimichanga and I have to say It definately delivered. The rice and beans were also quite good. I would say it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"The service was good! The waitress was really nice and humorous.. the food on the other hand,, not so much! I won't be back even for free food! Let  alone over priced food and not at all tasty! I ordered the Chimichanga and it was really greasy! The beef tasted like if it came from a can!  There are lots of good options for Mexican food, but not this one!"}
{"text":"Great super bowl party, welcoming ,friendly staff, food was good,  snacks provided too, everyone had a good time."}
{"text":"Food was good and same with the service. I ordered some beer and tacos and both were really good. Its a family own and operate mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here for dinner every so often.  Being creatures of habit (some say boring, I say hey, I know what I like!) we always order the same thing.  I get chicken fajitas, he gets pollo fundido.  Now, you would think that we would plan this out and come on Thursday nights when it's $11.95 fajita and fundido night, right?  Wrong.  I have no idea why but we totally suck at planning to go on Thursdays.  If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're gonna have to wait to get a table.  Tuesday and Wednesday nights are nutty - senior night and family night (kids eat free I think).    Service is usually on the slow side whether the restaurant is busy or not.  My husband loves their chips and salsa.  I personally don't like them all that much because the chips are paper thin and they always seem to be greasy when we're there.  The chicken in the fajitas is always good - very flavorful.  I would like it better if there was more chicken, less onions but such is life.  My husband loves the fundido.  He always looks for something like it on other Mexican restaurant menus but has never found anything he likes better than Valle Luna's fundido.  Their rice and beans have excellent flavor.  Overall the food is pretty decent, the service is slow, the parking lot sucks, and good luck getting someone to refill your water glass!"}
{"text":"Wow! Where to even start. First I'm not a picky eater so I ate. Salsa was old and the cilantro that was in it was almost black. I got shrimp tacos: tortilla are cheap I had to make my own taco, and it came with lettuce! Really? Where's the cabbage like it suppose to come with. And no limes on the side. After I was done with my toco I had a random bowl of cilantro brought in. If I could give this place a zero I would. Totally white people ingredients and style of cooking Mexican. First and last time I come here."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good. Everyone seemed to be happy to help us. Good at accommodating for the kids as well. Best margaritas!  Very good experience"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time. Food is not the same, and salsa is like out of a jar. Used to love the chips and salsa. What happened?"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5 times now. It is always super busy, most times you have to wait for a table but not longer than 10 minutes and it is so worth the wait. Everyone always seems very friendly and helpful from the hostess to the people cleaning the tables off. I tend to get the same thing, cheese enchiladas with rice and beans, but thankfully the people I go with switch it up so I get to taste quite a bit, and all the food is great! I am new to eating real authentic mexican food so I don't consider myself and expert, but the food is great, and the friends that keep taking me back are mexican food enthusiasts and one is actually Mexican... so I'd say they know good food when they taste it too. The prices are decent, the parking is a little hard because its so packed but again always worth it."}
{"text":"This place will always have a small place in my heart! I have been coming here for over 20 years, and they have been more consistant of that period of time than any place i know. Amazing!  I usually come up here a lot during football season to watch the games on Sunday. They have some pretty cool specials all day and have a ton of TVs throughout the place, which makes it way easier to stay caught up on the different games.   The food is actually really good here. I usually get the ground beef burrito enchilada styles with the sour cream, cheese, and guacamole on the I side. Can't go wrong with it. It's so damn delicious! The chips and salsa are addicting in so many ways. Haha if you like to drink alcohol they usually have specials on select draft beers, margaritas, and bloody Mary's.   I really so enjoy paying this place a visit even know it's usually a few time every year. But it's comforting to know that this place hasn't changed and it's remains amazingly consistent."}
{"text":"Very miss or miss. Gone a few times to give the benefit of doubt. And disappointed each time. The meat was cold in the carne and the beans left more to be asked for. Service was slow and not very personal (very transactional)"}
{"text":"Didn't care for the fact that we made reservations 36 hours in advance so that we could get there and told to wait while they set up for us. Is my expectation too high?   I still like the food and service though."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican food.  The chimichanga with the green chile sauce is a definite must ."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Valle  Luna thousands of times over the years. I grew up a few blocks away. Not its one of those places where it's like a last resort to goto. They have lowered their quality to near bottom of the barrel from meat to produce. I think it's because they run the buy one get on free coupons all the time. The service here is also hit or miss."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service and a green chili burrito to die for! No wonder they are always busy!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is a N Phx ICON.   I cannot tell you how many times I have been here, but I can tell you that there is nothing unique or outstanding. The best part to me is the chips but the salsa is lacking.   The prices are ok the portions are huge. The lounge is usually cool."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Ohio and whenever family or friends come to Phoenix and ask for good Mexican food, I take them to Valle Luna.  My favorite dish is the steak/chicken fajitas.  Everyone has raved about it so I will take every visitor there for some delicious real Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has got some of the best Mexican cuisine in town.  One of my favorites.  Cream cheese jalapeno dip is a must, that's probably the number one reason I go to this place when craving Mexican food.  Mini bandidos are great finger foods too.  The place is always busy, but when it's good food and reasonable prices, can't expect any less."}
{"text":"The food had no taste. Service was mediocre. Wouldn't recommend this to a friend. Not worth the price"}
{"text":"I just recently stopped in with a group of 9 people on sat night and we didn't have to wait at all for 2 booths in the cantina. Stevie was our server and she was very nice and patient as well as efficient. I love servers that can take an order in there head without writing anything down. My girlfriend and I split the fundido which was amazing! We will have to come back for the happy hour which looks awesome!"}
{"text":"If Heaven served Mexican Food, it would come from Valle Luna."}
{"text":"Mexican food, my new favorite!!  We got here during the dinner rush and had to wait about 15 minutes but it wasn't too bad.  The service was excellent and the recommendations the server provided blew my socks off.   The nachos with REAL cheese, not that velveeta crap was tasty. The fundido dish I had was HUGE! And tasted sooo good!!  I will most definitely bring my family here when we vacation here in the near future."}
{"text":"I dunno about authentic, but Valle Luna serves up some pretty good, greasy, Mexican eats.  The Vallitos and Lunitas are a good appetizer (mini burros and flautas). The fajitas here are pretty good. The chips and salsa is super addicting (love the spicy one), and the guacamole is nice and fresh.   I don't mind coming here when I'm in the mood for some Mexican food, armed with a coupon (they usually come in the mail or in the super shopper/savvy saver/whatever it's called)."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years, to come to find out tonight they, for whatever reason, decided to change their hot sauce. Changing something unbroken!! Now it's just watered down (cutting corners) and supposedly more spices (watered down). We sent all of it back, unfortunately. Then the cheese-crisp was missing significant amounts of cheese (cutting corners). Unfortunately we won't be xomin"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and friendly staff. The portions are great for the price and always recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a nice sit down meal."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for a date night because everyone at work raved about it. I am not sure why but I got sick after eating there. The Food was decent. Nothing spectacular. We haven't been back."}
{"text":"Valle Luna can fill up  quickly, so your best bets are to go around peak hours or perhaps week days. If it's crowded and you want less noise, ask for one of the smaller rooms. The dining room is compartmentalized into several sections of varying size. The dining room and restaurant in general are nicely decorated and not gaudy.  Chips and salsa are complimentary. The salsas are good, but not spicy. The chips are good, but I suspect they're just good quality packaged chips, so if you're looking for the thicker chips, this may not be for you. Try the street tacos. Those are well made. The spinach enchiladas are also well made with lots of cheese.  We also had a chance to visit the restrooms. They are nicely decorated and were very clean, despite the large crowd."}
{"text":"We had such a good time during the summer 99 cent margaritas and atmosphere was great the food was wonderful prices are great definitely definitely definitely will go there again and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"It's not the first bad experience we have had here. My friend and I sat at the bar. She was carded for Pepsi. Pepsi, really? Then I had to show mine to get water. Who does that?"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid and I love love livr this place! Best Mexican Food in the Valley and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"We were here last night and it will be the last. The service was good.  We ordered the cheese crisp and it was way over cooked there was hardly any cheese (You could see the tortilla through it in several places) and what was there was almost burnt. My cheese enchilada had very little cheese in it and under the broiler so long the cheese on top burnt.  And the kicker of the meal was my husband ordered a shredded beef enchilada and they laid a cheese enchilada over a pile of beef. Like who does that lol. And the rice was gross. I did like the diet Pepsi."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Customer service is outstanding and food is very cheap and good! My fave Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delciocus traditional Mexican food with a NM twist. This place is always busy. Call ahead so you don't get pissed off when you arrive to a 1 hour wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, best and cheapest happy hour around. recommend the mexican pizza with shredded beef and jalapeno cream cheese.."}
{"text":"Dee and I love coming here for lunch. The food is pretty good and the staff very friendly.  I had the Fundido. I've never had this before but the name is appropriate - its so fun to eat. Very naughty with all the cheese and sour cream lusciousness. I had it with pork, it was flavorful but some pieces were a little tough. Overall the flavor was very good.   The staff here are very friendly and attentive. Another great experience."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, a family favorite. Until my last experience, I ordered a breakfast burrito. The waiter brought a bean and rice burrito. I advised her that I ordered a breakfast burrito and she took the burrito back to the kitchen and brought me back a jalapeño burrito. I thought it was a sick joke from the cook. A burrito with at least 20 jalapeños in it!!! I told the waiter I'm not eating this and I'm not paying for it and left...haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed. Salsa and hot sauce were bland. Chimi had good meat. Service was good but van get better flavor elsewhere"}
{"text":"ready?  dive-y feel is part of the charm.  price?  on point for what one will get.  service?  very consistent.  perfect?  no but it's a $12 a plate place - lighten up  :)  beers are cold, food is hot, people are nice, price is cheap.  that's a good combo.  nice to support a local business too.  visited the Luna since 2003."}
{"text":"Went here for a b-day lunch.  Decided to have lunch in the cantina, as this is the norm.  Arrived at 11 am, made our way back to the cantina.  Sweet!  Time for beer....until....my nose...darn you nose....  See, the cantina had just been wiped down and they used a towel that smelled sour...E double you...  We left and went to Bell Road where all was great!"}
{"text":"The margaritas were strong and I LOVE their spinach con queso dip!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing, the service is great and the atmosphere is awesome. Try the steak fundido, it's incredible."}
{"text":"Checked this place out based on a friends recommendation.  It's usually a good sign when the parking lot is free of any vacant spots.  It has a nice ambience and the noise level is very tolerable.  Our waiter was very attentive and recommended both of our dishes.  (Fundido Burrito & Mexican Pizza)      Mexican pizza was very greasy - but still good.  Fundido burrito - cheese sauce - was really good.  Salsa was good - reminded my wife of her favorite Mexican restaurant's in Tucson - Mi Nidito.   Prices on the food were a bit steep for this style of restaurant.  However the drink prices made up for it.    Probably the best Mexican food we've had since we relocated to the valley from the Dirty T."}
{"text":"So-so Mexican food.  I have heard people raving about this place and I don't really get it.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than Manuel's or Filiberto's... but that's about all I can say.  Okay, their Pollo Fundido is good (but not great like you will get at Ajo Al's). But let's talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream \"I was remodeled in the 80's\"! Lame.  Good chips and salsa but small-ass bowls!   Oh, and don't expect to park in their little lot during dinner rush.  Also, the surrounding neighborhood is definatly the ghetto-side of the Moon Valley area."}
{"text":"I will never eat at a Valle Luna location ever again. My car was badly damaged in their parking lot while I ate. ( We waited an hour on a Thursday,  and once we were seated we were crammed in like sardines. Even the seven-year-old girls were complaining they didn't have any room. That's not what my complaint is though) They have video of my car, but are refusing to give it to me. First I was told that the person in charge couldn't see the cameras. Then I was told that it was a black truck that hit me while I was inside eating. The driver was a white male late 20s or early 30s, but they didn't see his license plate. I was told that the maintenance manager for the entire group of restaurants was going to burn it for me yesterday, and I drove all the way over there just to be told that he forgot and already left for the day.  I'd have to come back today. The store manager laughed at my frustration. Apparently it's funny to have your customers cars hit and damaged in your parking lot. Today, I was told that although they do have video they didn't even bother to review it for the full time that I was there, and they weren't going to give it to me because it's against policy. So which is it? They watched it long enough to see who hit me or they didn't ? Brayden, the guy that I spoke to today assured me that he has no idea why the manager would have said that they saw my vehicle being hit. Right...  so the manager made up the fact that it was a black truck and a white male in his late 20s or early 30s... Or you're just saying that because you weren't allowed to give the information out and now you're covering your butts. Either way I will never be back at this establishment ever again. I will make sure every single one of my friends and co-workers knows that if your car is damaged on their property they don't give a crap."}
{"text":"This is one of the most notable authentic Mexican restaurants in the area. I know this place has been around since my high school years, so safe to say it's been a hot minute lol. Now I can pass on the tradition with taking my family to have some good Sonoran style cuisine. Even having dinner after 7 the parking lot was full!  To start off I always know a good Mexican restaurant by the chips and salsa appetizers. Let me tell you that the chips are fresh and not stale like I have had elsewhere. The two salsa's are fresh and chunky. When I have Mexican food I mostly default to a ground beef burrito plate with a side of rice . The plate was a perfect temperature and came out within ten minutes. All in all I need to start coming back more often!"}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere and the food is good, too! From the chips and salsa to tasty fajitas, delicious crispy tacos to just plain old rice and beans-everything was fresh and hot when it got to the table. We went on a busy Friday night and were seated in 15 minutes, served another 10 minutes later. That is great service for packed house. A bit of a drive from Scottsdale but worth it! Definitely take a large group here-the prices are great, too!"}
{"text":"Saturday was a great day to be out and about, weather was perfect in the valley. I had made plans with a friend to do hang out with them and have lunch and told her that since I was on her side of town, she needed to pick the place, and she picked Valle Luna.  Now I have been to the Valle Luna by my house and was not very impressed but I went with an opened mind and hoped things were better this time.  I ordered the exact same thing as last time, Fundido burrito; chicken inside a fried tortilla topped with jalapeno cream cheese sauce & melted cheese with beans and rice. This time the burrito was not burnt to a crisp, it was lightly fried and with the melted cheese and the jalapeno cream sauce it was a great combo!   Thanks for not letting me down Valle Luna!"}
{"text":"Absolutely so bad for you but so worth it! Sitting at the bar is so fun as the bartenders are very entertaining. Happy hour is killer and lasts until 7:30 pm which is nearly unheard of. The real surprise in my opinion is how phenomenal the spinach enchiladas are! I'm a serious carnivore and I order the vegetarian spinach enchiladas every time! It was a recommendation from one of the servers when I couldn't decide what to get and I am so grateful for that server! They have great specials and it's always packed so don't be upset if you have to park on the street. A must try!"}
{"text":"This is a late review: My husband and I had dinner at Valle Luna on the 9th of May, during Cinco De Mayo. It was busy even at 7:00PM however, our hostess who was very friendly and greeted us right away, found an empty booth to seat us. Our waitress came quickly and asked us what we wanted to drink: we ordered ice tea. Chips and salsa was delivered next to our table and we munched on the fresh, hot, crispy chips with fresh salsa while we perused the menu. We both decided to order a combination meal. My husband and I ordered the taco, enchilada and tostada meal #5 on the menu. We did not have to wait long before our hot meals came out from the kitchen. They were so hot the waitresses had to use hot pads to bring them out to us. Everything was delicious. The taco and tostada were crunchy and filled with ground beef for me and shredded beef for my husband. My enchilada was beef and my husband chose chicken. Overall the quality of the food is outstanding, the service is exceptional and the restaurant is clean, including the restrooms. I can tell they value their employees and it shows in their employees, whom are friendly and provide excellent customer service. I like this location as it is a convenient drive from our home. We will definitely be returning in the near future to have either lunch or dinner again."}
{"text":"What happened to my Favorite restaurant? I use to come here all the time and it was fabulous. I've been back a few times recently, because I wanted to see if the results would be any different because of a mad rush and that's why all our food was served cold and super greasy. Unfortunately, those few times have been pretty consistent and I'm really disappointed. Now when someone in our group suggests Valle Luna on Bell, I'll opt out and meet them later."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. I have only eaten in the bar till tonight. The dining room is great. I like the full menu. The tamale diner is kinda fun. The beans are great and tamales are meaty."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here and the service was good, but the noise level was horrendous.   You can't hear the person sitting across the booth from you it's so loud.  Plus they had four hostesses all standing around talking.  They were very rude instead of greeting customers.  Place could certainly use a renovation.  They also might consider a few more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Service is kind of slow. It seemed like our waitress was serving the entire little section we were in, so I could understand that, but the extra help probably wouldn't have hurt considering how big this place is.  The food is average, it really isn't anything to get excited over. Popos on 51st and bell is much better in terms of food. We only came here since we had a groupon... One thing this restaurant needs to do is bring in spoons for dips and salsas. We had a group of 6 who passed around the cheese dip (which seized up after about 10 minutes...) And a spoon would've been great. Also, music choice is weird... This is a Mexican restaurant right? Some Mexican music would've been better instead of hearing Katy Perry telling me I'm a firework. The sad thing is I used to love this place as a child, but compared to other places it's just... mediocre.  All-in-all I probably won't be back here unless there's a groupon or something."}
{"text":"Love coming to a Mexa place and I see all kinds of people enjoying great food and jamming to ColdPlay  ... Mexican people truly understand that the color of true  race is GREEN, like money"}
{"text":"Place is full of Drama the staff is constantly gossiping about each other or there personal lives to each other or the regulars.all the employees hang out at the bar and get drunk in there uniforms. Why are managers writing positive reviews on yelp isn't it for customers??? Come on people!!!"}
{"text":"This post is actually from early September...   i wanted to give it 2 stars but only because of distance from me... which is not the restaurant's fault. so 3 it is.   the chips were outstanding which is usually always the first indicator of a mexican food restaurant's quality. The arroz con pollo was flavorful and not too dry (which is often the case). The rice had great spice to them (flavor spice, not heat spice) and the black beans were also above avg. Ambiance was full w mexican tapestries and the wait staff, although less \"authentic\" than i would've expected, were helpful when asked. However, i knocked one star off because it was obvious each of them were serving cuz it was their job... not because they enjoyed being there. And they made that known through body language. knock another star for lighting (dim) and their intention for table turnover was more apparent than i would've liked it to be. I felt somewhat rushed, probably in an effort to accommodate the wait."}
{"text":"Easily one of the better Latin/Mexican restaurants in the area.  Menu selection is large with very good service, prices are affordable, and with the amount of food you get- a bargain.  Burrito was a little sloppy and oily, but palatable. Tacos seemed a little more healthier, but lacked the content of the best tacos (not enough lettuce, meat)"}
{"text":"One of our Meetup groups had their weekly dinner here and being as we hadn't been here in years we decided to join. Glad we did. The service was good as was the food. I ordered a Chili Relleno and a Crispy Chicken Taco. Both were delicious and cooked perfectly. Hubby had a combo plate with a Cheese Enchilada, Bean Tostada, and a Crispy Chicken Taco. He said everything was good as well. They made sure to keep our chips and salsa replenished as well as our drinks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last Sunday with three other people. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken right away. It did take a while for them to finally bring the chips and salsa to the table but once they did I was quite happy as they were hot and crispy and the salsa was just to my liking - very chunky and not too spicy. We started off with a cheese crisp to share. It was good however slightly over cooked in a few places. I ordered the Pollo Fundido which is basically a deep fried chicken burrito filled with jalapeño cream cheese. It was served with a side of rice and your choice of beans. I opted for the whole pinto beans and they supplied quite a kick. I was really glad that there was an abundance of cheese in them to cut down on the spice a little bit. The Pollo Fundido was excellent and I was only able to eat half of it which left the other half to take home for lunch the next day. Yay for me! Service was just alright. We did have to wait for more salsa and a refill on our drinks a couple of times. But all in all it was a good lunch and someplace I would definitely return to when I'm in the mood for American-Mexican food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here this evening for dinner with my husband and his friend. Needless to say.... I am writing this review from a different restaurant.  We didn't stay longer than 2 minutes!  When we went inside the hostess asked how many and if we wanted the restaurant or cantina.   When we replied with the cantina she slammed down the menus she had in her hand and just said down the hall, second right. Such an attitude. After I just stared at her in total shock, she started the \"nice girl\" routine.   We walked back the cantina, it was pretty quiet in there. But every open table that open was filthy. We sat at a table, and nice guy did come over and wipe it off. After waiting a few minutes and discussing how the hostess treated us, we all decided to leave.  This isn't the same Valle Luna I have been coming to for years. So disappointing."}
{"text":"North Valley Mexican excellence.  I have only been here one time that I was disappointed with the service, but one time compared to many other enjoyable times is forgivable.  Great food, excellent drinks and the bar is where it's at.  My favorite is the heart stopping Fundido.  Happy hour has 1/2 priced apps and BIG mugs to wash them down.  Chips and Salsa are in abundance and may fill you up before you enjoy your meal, so take it easy.  Great for a date night, family dinner/lunch, or a happy hour excursion."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around town. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Valle Luna has quintessential Americanized Mexican food... and sometimes that's just what I crave.  My hubby and I stop by when we get the hankering for a cheap Mexican beer or a margarita.  We always eat in the bar because they always have good drink  specials and they have TV's on every wall that are easily seen at pretty much every seat.  The food is nothing amazing, but I like the chunky salsa and the beans.  Although we've had several different servers, our orders have been messed up multiple times.  We don't mind it as much though, because the servers are always apologetic and quickly remedy the situation."}
{"text":"My personal favorite Mexican in the Valley.  Great warm chips and thick salsa.  Fantastic enchiladas (with green sauce) and consistently good service.  Always happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere...99% of the time. The bar can get loud and obnoxious. If the bar is full, avoid it. The dining area is very nice. Order a cheese crisp and a beer. This place does Mexican comfort food right!"}
{"text":"No idea how this place is popular. The food is average on a good day. What is most interesting is that their salsas are either from a jar or a can. What family-owned Mexican restaurant serves canned or jarred salsa?????? Been here about six times and just can't make it work. Something is always off with the meal."}
{"text":"I always hit up Valle Luna for a great happy hour. The wings are amazing, huge and only $7.50 for happy hour. They are always running great drink specials. Fast friendly service is also a plus. If you need a new happy hour spot check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been to numerous Valle Luna locations and the food is consistently good.   This is a reasonably priced, casual place to get some mexican food.  I went last night, though, and all the bus and chip boys and girls were too busy playing grab-ass with each other to refill our chips.  Just thought I would throw that out there in case management is reading.  I thought it was entertaining if anything. Waitress was excellent though."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had! The place reminds me of the Winchester Mystery House with small rooms off one another that go on and on forever - which makes this place HUGE but with a small, intimate feel. And the service is fantastic.  I had the chimichunga and it was delicious. We also had a cheesy spinach dip to start that had a nice little kick to it. My nieces wanted queso but happily settled for chicken tenders and a hamburger. LOL  The flavors were amazing - as if someone's Grandma was back there for hours creating these delicious masterpieces. Their food is definitely crave-able and I'm looking forward to enjoying Valle Luna the next time we visit."}
{"text":"First off, the people giving Valle Luna five stars are bonkers. This is a mediocre Mexican restaurant that serves exactly what you'd expect -- watered down margaritas and things in tortillas smothered in cheese.   This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I have known people who can eat this type of food all day, every day and not get tired of it. Heck, they might even go on Yelp and give it a coveted five-star. Not this guy.  If you're in Arizona and you've never had Mexican food for some reason, I certainly wouldn't start here. There are five-star deserving hole-in-the-wall type restaurants LITTERED all over the valley with names even more Spanish-sounding than Valle Luna.   However, if you are the type that enjoys a good Macayo's enchilada, or the margarita mix out of the big plastic bottle--give Valle Luna a try."}
{"text":"so far the best mexican place I've had so far... everything is homemade... the salsa, the tortilla... we had the cheese crisps and the fundido... tasted pretty good especially the cheese crisps.. that mixture of melted Monterey cheese and cheddar.... YUMMY!! pretty good portions too"}
{"text":"This is a really good, locally owned chain. The food selections are solid, it is fairly authentic, and the servers are always pleasant. I have been to the one on Bell Road also and both do a very good job."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a happy hour with great drink specials and free chips and salsa, then this is your place. They also have great specials on appetizers during happy hour. I want to say you can get a huge cheese crisp for like $3. My favorite thing on their menu is the spinach queso. It is made with a creamy white cheese and it is delicious. The rest of their menus is nothing spectacular, but their happy hour is definitely worth stopping in for. They even have TV's in the cantina so you can catch whatever game is on while you enjoy some beers!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the inside of the place kinda smells like mouse poop. I always leave wondering if there are rodents because of the smell or the place is just old. Wish theyd fix that. Otherwise, id absolutely visit more often. Service is great, bar service awesome. Specials and selections are Right On."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon for the first time. We live in the area and had never tried this place... unfortunately, we will never go back. The booths are so close together you feel as though you are sitting on top of the people around you. My daughter's order was wrong, my husband's carne asada didn't even come out with the rest of our meals. Then, when his food finally came out it, the meat was extremely undercooked! He has requested medium well and his meat was rare. The waiter was very understanding and took the food back. However, my husband didn't get his new plate until the rest of us were done with dinner. Once he finally did start eating he was extremely disappointed as the meat had been cooked incorrectly and tasted like charcoal. We didn't want to make a big deal about it so we just paid for it and left. I am giving two stars because the waiter was very nice and my street tacos were good. However, everything else completely outweighs those two things. There are too many good Mexican food choices around for us to every go here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last week and I was really happy we tried it! I had the Pollo Fundido and it was amazing, my boyfriend had a carne asada burrito that he really enjoyed and my 2 year old loved his mac and cheese...and he's very picky. I definitely recommend this place to anyone out there wanting good mexican food...and try the pollo fundido!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pollo fundido at this place!! My boyfriend has the carne asada plate that he liked, and my son loves the mac and cheese. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for good mexican."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time off a friend's recommendation. The parking lot was very full, that seemed like a good sign. We got inside and were greeted immediately by the front staff. We waited about 10 minutes for a table. Not bad. Upon arriving at our table, we realized the booth was not cleaned off very well. There was food still on the booth seats. My husband made note of it but the staff didn't seem too do much or seem concerned. During the wait for our meal the busboy wiped off two tables. ( wiped off is an overstatement) he wiped food onto the floor both times. another host staff swept the food up while I sat wibderinf if anything was going to fly onto the tables around. all this going on during dining hours with a full dining room. in each instance the busboy half wiped the tables, left food on the tables, and the seats around it. He even proceeded to set place settings on them. you could tell he did not seem like he wanted to be there or do his job. other staff members didn't seem surprised. food was decent and hot when it arrived at the table, but after seeing the way the dining area is kept that will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Party of 13 with reservations on a Friday night.  We were seated in the cove. Seating was a bit awkward for the size of our group; but we were taken care of.   The chips and salsa we good to get started. All our food came out at the same time.   I had the Albondigas soup and a shrimp tostada - all good.   The fare is fairly standard Mexican Phoenix food. Can't say anything blew me away and everything needed a kick of el tapatio!   Good spot, good service for a large group and a festive atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Stopped on in to pick up take out on Mothers Day. The food was good. Not spectacular just good. I will recommend everyone stop in as usually the food is great."}
{"text":"lately, the fundido here is my guilty pleasure. i can't get enough of it. i know it is just mexican junk food, but damn that fundido is good. get the steak one, not the chicken. the steak is better. i also think the rice is better than the beans. the busboy will give you as much free chips and salsa as you want. don't forget to ask for the hot sauce - it has good flavor and isn't too spicy.  the servers are really good at this location - attentive, quick and not at all annoyed by coupons. for some reason, there's a buy one get one free entree coupon in my valpak every single week - that makes my mexican junk food fix a pretty darn good value. that's awesome for me, because it means g and i go to valle luna a lot, and i get my fundido fix a lot."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to AZ and this place was awesome. It was packed but we got our food fast and it was really good. I got so much food I have leftovers for ten hotel!! If I come back this will definitely be a must for another visit!!"}
{"text":"Valley Luna is right down the street, but for some reason I usually choose other Mexican restaurants. It's always busy. I like their chips and salsa and fundidos. Kind of pricey for what it is, but I recall a good happy hour menu."}
{"text":"What happened? We ordered takeout yesterday and were so disappointed. The steak fajitas...mostly onions, a few peppers and only a few slices of steak. Such a small amount of food compared to a few years ago. They forgot to give us tortillas. The shrimp quesadilla was basically a shitty cheese crisp with 5 or 6 pieces of shrimp total. Not worth it. Don't order takeout from here."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is our favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley. The flavor is not just about hot and spicy. Fantastic place for dinner and out of town guests."}
{"text":"One of my friends raved about this place as she grew up here, so we made our way on a Friday night. She enjoys the specials in the bar area, which can become really crowded and loud at times. The food and drink are top notch, and twice we have had the same waiter, Joe who takes great care of us. The food is top notch,  I haven't had anything I didn't love yet, and my friend is very familiar with the menu and all of her recommendations are right on par. It's one of my new favorite places to go. They also have take out, a restaurant part and outdoor area. You can tell why this place is always busy, because even the chips and salsa are fresh. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Best salsa in Phoenix! Great service, food, and atmosphere. Must try the shredded beef tacos, incredible :)"}
{"text":"Mmm, delicious mexican food here. We went for lunch and the restaurant was packed. That was the first good sign.  My friend's ordered traditional mexican dishes with enchiladas beans and rice, and the chile rellenos verdes. Plate sizes were large! I had a bbq chicken wrap that had an amazingly tasty sweet sauce over it that complimented the bbq chicken. One of the tastiest wraps I've ever had! This place also serves more traditional American fare for the difficult eaters in your party. All in, very good. Table of three, check was about $38 before tip."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is amazing!!!  Bandito burittos are my favorite.  Good atmosphere.  Get there early it is usually packed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots! The Mexican potato skins are half price during happy hour and really good! Plus happy hour goes late and is on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas! The tacos were really good and I plan to go back and try a burrito really soon!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna was recommended to me by a colleague while traveling on business to Phoenix, Arizona.  Needless to say: I visited Valle Luna at least two more times later that week.  Each visit, there was a small wait - At least 10 to 15 minutes.  There is, however, plenty of room, both inside and outside, to wait.  Once seated, chips and salsa were received at the table almost instantly.  Each time, the waiter or waitress was shortly behind to gather my table's drink order.  On one visit, I had the high-end margarita with top-shelf tequila, which comes served in a mason jar, but is average amongst other margaritas I have had.  The chips always came to the table warm; although on at least one occasion, we seemed to have gotten the last batch of chips for the day (there were few that were whole).  The salsa has a ton of flavor, but not very much heat.  I have had several dishes during my visits to Valle Luna, and although a single one does not stand out more than the other, I can say that the fajitas are really good (who can mess up grilled chicken and steak?!).  A word of caution: Valle Luna's food seems to expand in the stomach, which can and *will* catch up with you!  I have made several attempts to be coherent of my food intake in an effort to avoid overeating, but it never did work."}
{"text":"Very tasty, service was not very good or I'd give it 5 stars-server was not very good. Their jalepeno cream cheese dip is excellent! My fiance even liked the food and he doesn't really like Mexican. Its kind of more like tex-mex than Mexican food. They give you huge portions. It's not too expensive either-kind of like a family dining experience."}
{"text":"Had excellent service from Melissa tonight! Food was tasty and came out quick which is great when you have little ones. Melissa made us feel welcome from the moment we sat down and was super attentive! We are family night regulars with our family of 6, we've always had good service here but we will definitely be requesting her from now on and you should too!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a couple of years and today was my last visit. The food is average at best but what really annoyed me is that I met friends in the cantina for happy hour and it was a miserable experience. After we were there for a few minutes they turned a basketball game on near us and it was super loud. Now I get it, people like their games but looking around I didn't see anyone watching. I asked the waitress if she could have it turned down and she said that she would ask the bartender but he never turns it down after others have asked. I'm not sure if she actually asked him or was patronizing me by saying she would. It was so loud that we were yelling to hear each other at my table. When another server came to clear our table and asked how everything was I again asked if the volume could be turned down and got the same response, the bartender won't turn it down. I looked around and still nobody was watching the blaring game. I'm convinced that the only reason it as so loud was so that the bartender could hear it. I guess this bartender doesn't give a shit about his customers and because of that I'll not be back.  As a side note, Manuel's is SO much better food and great service and will be getting our business from now on."}
{"text":"Had a party of 14 seniors, and came here the on recommendation  of several of them.  Service was worse than terrible.   Some of us got their order the rest of us got the wrong thing  and we all waited 1 to 2 hours for our correct order.  had to beg for drink refills and even for our check.  The food was good but not hot enough.  Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about this place, I just had to go and check it out. There was alot of people but not overcrowded, it was alot of families and there kids. The food was awesome!! I had the fundido with jalapeno cream cheese and it was so good!! It had this awesome unique taste to it where you just couldnt stop eating, even when full. This was the only place that makes there mexican rice exactly like my moms!! It was delish! You can tell there refried beans were very authentic. Ive been to alot of mexican restaurants and this one is by far the best!"}
{"text":"The food is decent and happy hour is good. Do not sit at the bar if you want to be served. The bartenders all talk amongst themselves... very chatty, but pay no attention to the people at the bar. Terrible, terrible customer service!  I would advise sitting at a booth or a table!  Much better service there!"}
{"text":"About the BEST Mexican Food Restaurant in the Phoenix area. We've tried pretty much every Mexican Food Restaurant in the Valley. Excellent service, Good Quality Food that tastes amazing. The Chili Shrimp dish is awesome. Great hot sauce!! Happy Hour is pretty crowded but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Most items are good and experience is good, however I had the shredded beef enchiladas today and the meat was very fatty.  A complete turn off ."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is an amazing restaurant and bar. They have homemade tortilla chips and salsa as an appetizer. They were  heavenly. I ordered the chicken fajitas and a strawberry margarita. I must say that this was one of best meals I have had in ages. The staff was energetic and friendly. Great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend Valle Luna to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfect Sonoran cuisine at really great prices.  6 taco basket, loaded nachos and a cheese crisp plus three drinks for around $40.  Service was super friendly and it was luckily not too packed on a Sunday afternoon. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The server Joan was great! The night was extremely busy and Joan turned the night around! Took amazing care of us - made sure we got all our food in a timely manner, made sure we had enough chips, etc. Please recognize her - she is a great server! Did great under the busy Saturday night pressure!  Only reason only 4 stars - long wait (which they can't help & is understandable) however the server for outside bar was fairly rude/short.  But overall, great experience! Thanks Joan!"}
{"text":"Bad, slow service, stale chips, mediocre food. What else can I say. If you come here for alcoholic drinks, probably okay. But this place is no better than any mexican fast food. Well, maybe better in the sense that you get to sit down and have your food served on a plate.  We just had to try it out as we had a coupon and the parking lot is always packed.  Needless to say, it was disappointing. This place is overhyped."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite spots in Phoenix. I grew up around the corner from this resturant and I could not get enough of their delicious, fresh chips and salsa, chicken taco baskets and cheese crisps. Even now when I come back to Phoenix its always on my to do list.The place hasnt changed much in the past 15 years you can always expect decent priced food a little on the indulgent side ( greasy) but the chips and salsa and margaritas never dissapoint. Its a family place that I will always adore!"}
{"text":"Love this place for the prices, good food good prices, only thing they need to update the decor!"}
{"text":"This review would be 5 stars if we were going strictly off of food and service. We started with their guacamole boat and spinach queso dip. Both were AMAZING. Their chips and salsa that come in the beginning are nice  because they give you both a mild and spicy salsa. My favorite is the spicy salsa, but the mild is great too. We tried the fundido with shredded beef and the shredded beef taco platter as the main dish. The tacos were great, but the fundido was one of the best chimi style burritos that I've ever had. We were highly impressed!!! My friends got their shrimp stuffed poblanos, which were heavenly as well. Everyone was very satisfied with their meals, and we had a table of 8 people.   The 4 stars is due to the drinks. We ordered margaritas that were on special. A house margarita on the rocks with salt. The waiter convinced us to do top shelf for 75 cents more so of course we said yes! When the margs came, there was zero taste of tequila. And this is coming from a person who LOVES tequila. I think they are short pouring their drink specials. Next time, I'll either go with their regular priced margaritas if I am desperate, or stick with a diet soda. See photo for shredded beef fundido!"}
{"text":"If you are new in town Valle Luna is a must stop for some great mexican food.  They have a few valley locations and will not disappoint.   The Sonoran Todo (Appetizer) is a platter of Mexican fried delights and can be shared by 2-3 people for your MEAL.  Its a great deal and super tasty.  The Pollo Fundido is also a must and can also be split as it comes with rice and beans.  The atmosphere is typical any mexican food spot, so pretty much out of date with several \"team\" photos of teams they support lining the walls.  The service is usually pretty good as well, but its the food that makes this place a must visit."}
{"text":"Y'all know that I am VEEEEEERY critical when it comes to Mexican Food!!!! So if I say it's good, rest assured that it is..... and Valle Luna IS GOOOOOOOOOD!!!!! Ask for Taylor if you're dining in the Cantina Area, she's awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"My work surprised us with lunch from this location. It is more similar to American-Mexican than authentic Mexican food. However, it was very good and rich in color. I peaked at the bill and it was very affordable. Would certainly recommend their party platters for large groups and will try a lunch special in the future."}
{"text":"This had been my favorite Tuesday night restaurant. My husband and I went so often that the waiters and waitress in the bar area knew our order. We ordered fajitas from the senior menu. We had not been able to go for a few weeks due to personal reasons, and went tonight and were not happy to see that the Tuesday night senior menu has now changed, and fajitas are no longer on it. Also you now have to both order a drink. I can't have caffeine or sugar and only drink water. So that is now another issue. I could order a soda and just not drink it. But unfortunately without the fajitas on the menu, we won't be going back anymore. They lost a very good customer over this. Before this it was a 4 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Our kids gave us a 50th wedding anniversary party and catered it from Valle Luna,  for 75 people,  oh my gosh they did a fabulous job!!  Plenty of food great variety  some chicken and some beef tacos, mini chimis , Rolled tacos, enchiladas lots of chips sour cream both kinds of salsa and guacamole, refried beans and rice. Everyone raved about how good the food was.    The kids said it was a great price  Thank you Valle Luna for a great job!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could only use one word to describe my dining experience at Valle Luna it would be LOUD. If you want to have a conversation, get ready to yell at the person sitting across from you.  My family and I went there on a Friday night. After a short wait we were seated in a booth right by where the waitstaff comes out from the kitchen and bar, which definitely contributed to the noise.  The place is pretty crowded and the atmosphere was one of general chaos. I saw the waitstaff running on more than one occasion and there were lots of kids screaming and running around, too. Not a great place for a relaxing dinner after a long week at work. Our server was fine - not particularly friendly but not rude. She just kinda went through the motions. I ordered the fish tacos with black beans and rice. For as lively as the restaurant was, the food was rather lacking. Well, the entrée anyway, the chips and salsa were good. The fish in my tacos was small and overcooked and the tortillas were kinda dry. The rice and beans were just okay, nothing special.   Afterwards, I just felt bloated and gross. There are way better options for Mexican food in this town. I won't be going back to Valle Luna any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm voting this the best customer service I've had in a long time!   We stopped into this Valle Luna on our way home, I've never been to this location, but now I think I've completed the circle.  The bartender was very polite and attentive and the waiter was also very sweet and helpful.  They must treat their employees well, cause they are certainly not disgruntled.    My boyfriend and I love Valle Luna, not sure if its because we both grew up on the restaurant or what, but they always satisfy.  All of the locations are kinda dark inside (good if you have a hangover). Mostly booths.  We like to sit in the bar area.  The margaritas hit the spot and are around $5-8, they usually have specials, and usually use good tequila. The margarita's I had today were especially delicious,  (maybe cause it was the first 100 degree day?) I had a raspberry marg and a white death marg."}
{"text":"Service was lacking as we waited for our drinks to be filled for about 10 minutes food was ok nothing real special about it you can find better out there. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Been going for years for lunch.  Food is consistent and good if a little high.  Of course, I think all mexican food is usually overpriced.  We always ask for Elizabeth.  We can call ahead and tell her we are coming and we don't even have to order; she just knows! The bus ladies know us and keep us filled with chips and salsa.  (my boss is a salsa pig and hogs it all so they bring us extra)"}
{"text":"We had been going since the early 80's, it was one of our favorites.   We stopped for awhile when the food didnt seem as good in the early 2000's.  It really seems like Valley Luna is back in full force with great food, lots of choices, and a value and taste that is top notch.  Loving it again."}
{"text":"As an avid fan of Mexican food, I came here with my boyfriend who came here constantly growing up. I ordered a cheese crisp and a taco plate. The cheese crisp was actually better than the tacos, it was gigantic crispy and cheesy which is everything I look for in a cheese crisp. But, honestly, it is pretty hard to mess up such a basic meal. Now, the tacos, extremely disappointing. I ordered crunchy with beef. The shells were actually dripping in grease when I got them and had absolutely no flavor.  I understand the tortillas need to be fried to make them crunchy but good god dab the grease off before handing me my tacos. Because they were laying in a puddle of grease I ended up just eating the interior of the taco and ignoring the shell."}
{"text":"Combination #9 is the real deal. Top that off with a few frozen Valle Luna alcoholic beverages and you are good to go."}
{"text":"Fresh chips and salsa.  Recommend the fundido."}
{"text":"I was referred to this restaurant by a coworker.  I thought the food was very pricey for what I got.  The staff were very nice, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Order the Steak Fundito!!!! Any of the funditos are amaing, but thats my favorite. Been going for over 15 years, Live in Cave Creek now and wish I could get that somewhere closer thats as good. But really...... just gotta meet there for a treat every once in awhile its the best! Tasteful, cheesy and awesome!"}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant often, and I have tried several things on their menu.  My favorites are the steak and shrimp fajitas and the red chile con carne.  I know a few reviewers mentioned that they don't feel like they get enough meat, but I always have had plenty.  True it is often below the onions and peppers, but unless I share I easily make 3 meals with 2-3 tacos each with every fajita meal I order.  No matter what I order, I always have leftovers.  Mostly, because between 2 of us we always finish the amazing chips and salsa (be sure to ask for the hot) prior to our meals arriving.   Every time I have been to Valle Luna we have had excellent service.  This is a great Mexican food restaurant, and this is coming from someone who rarely goes to a Mexican Restaurant twice.  Since, I usually feel like I could've cooked the meal better myself."}
{"text":"I've noticed some people comment saying \"I don't like Sonoran/New Mexican mexican food.\"  ...then why are you eating Mexican food in a primarily Sonoran Mexico area? Do you see an ocean? No, this isn't Baja.  Valle Luna is the premier place to get Sonoran mexican food. The portions are copious, the flavors are bold, and the food is consistently good.  I can't think of anything bad for this place."}
{"text":"I used to hate this place, and quite honestly, I'm just a HUGE fan of their Happy Hour.  It's awesome.   I haven't really found anything on their regular menu that's all that exciting, but I'm picky about my mexican food. I did have the steak fajitas and they were pretty good. One thing you MUST try is the Mexicali Relish, it's outstanding.  Their refried beans are pretty well done too.  They have happy hour Mon - Fri til 7, can't remember when it starts, but it's about how long they go anyway.  They have it on Saturday from 12-6 too, seriously sweet.  Their tall drafts are gigantic, it makes me do a double take anytime I get one somewhere else.  The employees seem to have a great bond too, at least in the Cantina, I never really get the feeling that any of them hate their job.    Things to be aware of: Salsa Hot or Chunky seems to be made daily, so it's not always the same.  I can't say that it's ever been bad though, just home made!  Same with the MexiCali relish - it's the hottest thing on their menu (it's like $1.75 extra), made up of roasted veggies, and comes in a little miniture taco salad bowl.  Looks like shredded beef, it's yummy.  Recommended with the Happy Hour Chicken tenders.  Tuesday is Senior night - if you are not a senior and you have plans to eat there, get there early, it's PACKED."}
{"text":"Wait was supposed to be 30-40 minutes ended up being over an hour. Had the bean dip, chicken posole, shrimp poblanos, chimichanga, corona Rita, and kids burros. Food was good. Server was busy but efficient. Wish they took reservations. Would still come back"}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday evening and since I am over 50 (barely) dinner was 1/2 off. Amazing. The waitress recommended a Chimichanga with shredded beef.  Loved it. And the white death margarita was great and it was pretty big. Good stop. I recommend this place if you are looking for a friendly family Mexican restaurant.  Bill came to $15.  What a deal!"}
{"text":"Five stars (ignore the one star!!)! We went the other night, for happy hour.  It was super busy but the server was very attentive to everything.  The food hit the spot, the cost was right and the drinks were spot on.  We even had good seats for the Bulls versus the Celtics."}
{"text":"Service is Top of the Line, they love their customers and the Love shows! The chefs obviously love the way they cook cause the love shows in the food. I took one bite of the chicken quesadilla and it melted in my mouth and the way they marinate the chicken OMG!!!! Flavors Busting inside your mouth!! We got so much Love for Valle Luna because they they GOT LOVE FOR US!!!!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being better when I was a kid. I will say I was impressed that they still had my picture on the wall from when we were sponsored by them in sports. I was not impressed by the food though. I remember loving to go here for the tamales, but they were average at best when we were here last Wednesday. The salsa was okay. The beans and rice were okay. Even the corona was just okay. Pretty disappointed but now I know what I'm getting. It's more of a place to have a drink and eat Mexican bar food; it seems hit or miss now."}
{"text":"Valle Luna never disappoints! Amazing food and there's always plenty to take home! I always get shredded beef enchiladas and they're the best!"}
{"text":"I frequent Valle Luna as I am a fan of great Mexican food and I live in the area.  I recently had a simple misunderstanding with a take-out order.  When I brought it to the attention of the hostess she instantly became aggressive taking no accountability only making matters worse.  This started becoming an argument that I didn't want any part of...I had a delicious chicken chimichanga waiting for me and I would rather eat it than argue with a teenager about my order.    ...why am I giving this a 5 star review?  As the owner of a small business with employees I would want to know of issues regardless of size so I called the admin contact.  I know not everything can always go as smoothly as preferred and these are often the moments that you can really tell what a business or person is made of.  The next day and spoke with the owner, Janie with regard to the issue and was pleased.  I wasn't looking for anything, I just wanted the restaurant that I enjoy to continue to be great.  Janie, handled the issue reasonably and professionally and I would tell she had a great deal of concern for her establishments.    Great food and a great commitment to customer service from the top down."}
{"text":"Solid, safe, somewhat gringoey Mexican fare... but decent indeed.  I have been coming here for years and usually have a good experience.  We usually hit the Cantina because they have a killer happy hour and lots of TVs with the games on. Lots of nibbles under $5 and cheap beer and well drinks.   Salsa is tasty but absolutely no heat. Even their \"hot\" sauce doesn't have heat.   My favorite items are the spinach enchiladas ($8 on Wednesdays) and the Mexican pizza ($5 on happy hour).  My husband likes their green chili pork, mini tacos, and the chicken tenders basket ( which drives me crazy that he orders American food in a Mexican restaurant).   Service is usually good but they can get very busy. I think they have one busser for the whole restaurant so sometimes it can take awhile to get dishes cleared or chips and salsa refills. Happy hour seating can be a war zone with crazies ready to kill each other over tables... luckily they started a happy hour wait list in the bar to prevent bloodshed.  I recommend Valle Luna as a place to take out of towners or people scared of Mexican food or spicy food. It is a nice, safe introduction to Mexican food. Or they can commit sacrilege like my husband and order chicken fingers or a burger..."}
{"text":"Valle Luna's has a great happy hour menu. The beers are 32 ounces and they have mini burrito basket that actually fills you up. So after drinking, eating chips and salsa, the happy hour basket does the job!   I always rate a place on their salsa and valle luna holds it own. I like mixing their hot and regular sauce to give it a little more bite.   Overall, their service and food is great and I am def a fan.   Manuel's and Valle Luna are pretty much on rotation for me when it comes to going to a mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Mex chow here. 3 of our group in tonite late. We all had the fried ice cream dessert first. Was VERY good. I had shredded beef tacos and asked for fried jalapenos. All perfectly prepared. Nice size portions for all of us and the food quality was excellent, as was service. Thanks folks . Very well done here."}
{"text":"I had high expectations on this place and unfortunately they were not meet up. Super dry tamal, one of the worst I've ever had and in top of that a very expensive one. The chips were very fresh which is nice but the salsas were really bland. My enchiladas were ok but not better than what you can get at any of the bertos restaurants. The only good thing was the margaritas and the service was great but definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights! Family night! $8 specials!!! It's a ton of food for very little pocketbook. There's plenty of selection to choose from - I got the taco, enchilada, and tamale special with rice and beans. Way too much food for 1 sitting, especially when I've been munching on those addicting chips and salsa. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to the one on Bell about 5 years ago and it was great. Revisited this place last weekend and something happened - It wasn't good at all...  Sorry Valle Luna"}
{"text":"This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant! The salsa was literally pace from the super market (disgusting). When I asked for a Corona they ran out, so I asked for a Coke  (they didn't have that either). It was a little frustrating. When we got our entrees my fajitas was supposed to have steak but it tasted like chopped liver, and my sisters burrito was dried out, the booth we sat in was tiny, it looked like I was serving my breasts for dinner!!    The only good thing was our server was super polite and rushed to get us anything we needed,  otherwise I would have given it a 1 star."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner during happy hour and sat in the cantina. We ordered way to much food. I ate the burritos which only came with beans and they where cold. They where ok for being beans only. I also got cheese crisp which you cant find in Cali and it was pretty good. This place gets crazy hectic and you should plan on waiting to get in for awhile."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are addictive.  Servers are happy and seem to enjoy their jobs.  Dinner of enchiladas yummy!"}
{"text":"We alway get great food and service. I highly recommend eating here. Not only is it fresh but it's authentic Mexican food like my Nanas and moms. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A solid place for decent Mexican food and good service. You won't be amazed by anything, but you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"This place never skips a beat. My coworkers and I usually go for lunch and everything I've ever ordered is delicious. My go to meal is the machaca beef enchilada and it is ever so tasty! Last two visits I've tried the hatch green chile and I wasn't disappointed at all. The spicy and flavor combination was out of this world. The salsa that you get with the chips is also amazing... I always run through 2-3 bowls of it. And oh gosh I can't forget the roasted jalapeños. Since I've spent time typing this, I'm going to have to get some tomorrow. Love a good food spot!!!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are homemade and tasty.  Prices are reasonable.  Portions good.  I love their coupons!"}
{"text":"I love the taco basket appetizer! And OMG the steak fundido! So, so good!   The blue margarita is very yummy and potent but quite delicious!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place, but was pretty disappointed. We ordered nachos and a shrimp burro. Nachos were pretty good, huge portion but the burro was pretty bad. Soggy tortilla, shrimp was severely over cooked and the green sauce tasted old. Chips were not salted, but the salsa was good. Waitress didn't refill our drinks until we asked for the check, the service sucked. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you're Zack and Kelly, you'll love this place. If you're Jose and Maria, no les va gustar, sigan buscando."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location over the past 10 years for the causal after work get together, birthday dinners, and other large family events. The service and food have been excellent on all our dine in visits.  However, on 4/13/14, my to go order was less than satisfactory, as was the follow up with the owner on 4/23/14.  I didn't check the order before leaving because I've never had cause to check it. After arriving home in El Mirage, I found half the order of the Sonoran Todo missing, and what was present, was severely overcooked and soggy. It looked liked Freddy Kruger had a stroke while packaging the order. The food was just smashed together. Because half the order was missing, we didn't have enough to feed everyone.   I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who was very professional and took ownership of the situation. He offered to make another order which I turned down because of the distance and time back to the restaurant and home again. He offered to take down my receipt number, items ordered, and dollar amount of the full order. He advised he would send this information to HR and they would call me in a day to discuss my experience and send me a gift check for the full order.  The total order was $19.17 for the sonoran todo and a side of rice and beans. This was not a huge amount, but I still wanted satisfaction for the money and time spent.  The next week a gift check arrived for $15.00, without a letter or explanation. I also never received a phone call.  Today, I called HR and spoke to one of the owners, Janie. I briefly recounted my experience and why I was calling. Janie stated in a matter of fact tone she recalled my order and sent out $15.00. I told her I was told by the manager I would be given the full amount of the order and a phone call from HR, which is why Is calling today.  Janie very strongly told me that managers are not authorized to give out amounts of a refund, that it has to come from the owners. She also repeated she had sent the check for $15.00, as if that should be the end of the discussion.  I advised her that I had been coming to that location for 10 years, going out of my way now being located in El Mirage, and that I should be given what I had been told I would get. I also was very disappointed with the initial service when I got the order, and again when I didn't receive a phone call to follow up on my poor experience.  She  curtly asked me what it was that I wanted, to which I replied $19.17. She said fine, I'll send another check for $5, and hung up the phone.  My reason for posting this review is not to discourage people from eating at Valle Luna. It's a fine establishment, with great food and employees. You should eat there if you never have tried it. Accidents happen, and sometimes there are less than satisfactory experiences.  My reason for posting this review is for the poor response from the owner. I have worked in the customer service field for over 15 years, 10 at the same company. Perhaps I expect too much from others because of the standard set by my employer. I would never cut off a customer, talk over them, use a rude and condescending tone, and then hung up them with nary a goodbye.  If the roles had been reversed, I would have thanked the customer for calling, expressed regret over their experience, took ownership, apologized and empathized. If within my power, which as owner it is, I would have graciously offered an additional amount, expressed thanks for giving us another chance to do better, and wished a pleasant experience the next time.  Janie is on my wall of shame for poor customer treatment.  As it's been said before, the check is in the mail. We'll see how the next time goes, and hope the next time Janie speaks with a customer, they'll receive better treatment."}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa.  Yup. That's about it for the positives.   We came in for lunch and the hostess couldn't be bothered to crack a smile at us or any of the other patrons. After we were seated, we were brought chips and salsa, which we happily dove into. When I got the egg, cheese, and chorizo burro I ordered, it just looked ill. And then I could only taste the bland, dry chorizo in it, no egg or cheese in the slightest. I dunked it in the red sauce it was covered in just to make it a little more flavorful, but to no avail. When we were ready for the check, our waitress disappeared. For a long time.   Not worth my time."}
{"text":"This place just has a really good happy hour. I usually just stick to appetizers when I go but with free chips and salsa all night, I don't need much more. Their happy hour goes from 3:00 to 7:30, fantastic considering happy hours seem to be ending earlier and earlier now a days.   There are plenty of HDTV's around to keep me entertained, so I'm gonna guess it gets really busy on Sundays during football.   This is just a good place for pretty cheap drinks and decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner for four take out. The Enchilada Suiza didn't have the cream sauce that's pretty much the signature of the dish. One person didn't get the rice she was supposed to get. My spinach enchilada was good, but the refried beans were half dried out and smeared against the edge of the container with the rice on top of it. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location in several years.  We went and I thought it was fantastic!  We went on Cinco de Mayo at lunch and it was pretty busy.  But they seated us right away.  We had great service and the food was wonderful.  I was happy to see lunch specials on a Saturday.  Normally lunch specials are week days only.  The prices were great.  I thought the salsa was great.  We received a regular and a hot.  We mixed them together and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Save your money, and drive a few more blocks to Filiberto's.  They are selling Filiberto's food at Outback Steakhouse prices.  The service is good though..."}
{"text":"I lived in Mexico for six years, and I have to say this place has some of the worst Mexican food I've ever tried.  I've had better Mexican food in Hong Kong!!!  The waiters are slow, and leave a lot to be desired in terms of manners.  The food tastes like nothing more than grease with cheese."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever!! Get their shrimp chili poblanos their bomb  also they have really tasty margaritas! All of their dishes are so authentic"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican food in the valley but was a little disappointed last night to see the price increases!  The meal I usually order went up by almost $4 that's crazy!   Ordered the nachos they got smaller and weren't as good as they used to be very dry.  Ordered the fundido and it was extremely spicy and never was.  Overall still good food just don't know if I can continue going if the quality doesn't meet the prices.  Service was subpar and it was annoying that there were kids running around and no one asking the parents to have them sit down.  Disappointed but will definitely try again. Maybe an off night!"}
{"text":"Great service in this large restaurant. We came for lunch and they have several. I e lunch specials. There are several choices of beans which is nice. Our chips and salsa were constantly filled between the sever and the bus person. My chicken burro was good but needed some sauce inside along with the chicken. Hearty portion of chicken. The black beans and Spanish rice were delicious. My dining partner was not thrilled with her spinach enchilada. It had a sweet taste that wAs not to her liking. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Love the football crowd. Always have a great time when we go. Fantastic wings. The staff is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I Go All The Time With My Family And They Have Really Great Food And Amazing Service. & The Price Is Semi Affordable. It Is Also Very Clean."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today with our meal. Typically we love this place but not sure if there is a new cook or what's going on in the kitchen but the mild sauce that they bring with the chips was hot and NOT mildand. Out cheese crisp we ordered came out with burnt edges and tasted like it had been sitting underneath the heat lamps and quality like cardboard!  I sure hope this was only a one time experience! Not to mention our guy server was .., our busboy had a great personality and should've been the waiter!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is one of my favorite Mexican spots in Phoenix. Last time I visited, I ordered the fajitas and had enough food for a whole other meal the next day. Their chips and salsa are pretty good and I've never had anything I didn't like here."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Food, service ,& atmosphere.  I was craving fish tacos - Baja Tacos - just like at the beach in So Cali yum!"}
{"text":"I knew this place must be great when I arrived and the parking lot was packed. The bar was filled and I waited about 20 minutes for a table. Not too bad right in the middle of dinner time and the food was worth the wait. Service was also very good. This is a gem of a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like Mexican food and seem to favor the enchilada combo. All these locations are great but this one had a small bar so I prefer the Bell road location. Always good food and service."}
{"text":"I always am on the look out for some great Mexican food and honestly, I dont find many places that would \"wow\" me.    My find is over..  My girlfriend suggested we go here after going through a list of 5 or so places.  She wanted Mexican, but we wanted to change from the usual places.  Valle Luna came up and we hurried over.  We walked in to find a slew of people waiting to be seated.  They said it would be about a 20min wait.  Not too bad. My girlfriend asked if they had any spots in the bar and we headed that way.  it felt like a Mexican sports bar!  ...the bar side did.  We found a nice booth with a few TV's around and within a few minutes, a waitress came over to take our order.    Im huge on chips n salsa and one thing I love is when they bring out hot sauce along with the salsa.  If hot sauce is there, I rarely touch the salsa.  They had it!!  I love and hate chips at the same time.  You can easily fill up on chips before your main dish comes out.  I tried to stop, but I just keep snacking.. Yummm.!  I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and when they brought it out, it looked and smelled amazing.  Covered with sour cream, lettuce and a side of re-fried beans and Spanish rice.  I went to town.  It was one of the best chimichangas Ive had.   I found my mexican restaurant!!  We came back later in the week for lunch..  loved it again!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is our favorite go to restaurant  !! Love their spinach enchiladas and Chimichangas ! We have gone there 20 plus years our waitress  Charlotte is the best we walk in she knows exactly what we want, always greets us with a smile and kind words  You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here been coming for years, joined my parents and my son for dinner on family night. It was pretty busy, but surprised no wait. We were seated, ordered food and an appetizer cheese crisp that never came. Our food came hot, and fast... It was good. Our drinks were empty for quite sometime.. Busy they were but neglected we felt. I'll still come back but maybe not at this time of the day. Our waiter was nice but just not that on top of things... No appetizer and empty drinks. We ordered dessert and he did come out quickly and refilled our drinks again... He tried maybe just too busy."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant. Me and my family have been coming here for years! Everything is tasty. It has a good lively atmosphere. The only downside is that the parking lot is always full, but for good reason!"}
{"text":"It kills me to write this but it is what it is.We have been going here since Don Rubens and after Luna took over although we have stopped over the years because things just weren't the same.  Thought we would give it a try since Po Po's had a thirty minute wait for two. We were seated right away, I ordered a green burro enchilada style with red (orange) sauce. By far the worst Mexican food I've had in a long long time. Since when is red enchilada sauce orange Bill? It looked like tomato soup, and almost tasted just as bad with Mexican food. Burro was dry on inside and hardly and enchilada sauce on top. Rice was maybe three tablespoons and was completely flavorless! The \"hot sauce\" looked and tasted just like tomato sauce out of the can. Bill you need go eat there some time and try the horrible food  their serving. This use to be the place to go but never again. Maybe Don Rubens will be back in there someday soon. Sorry Bill."}
{"text":"At a native to Phoenix I have tried many Mexican restaurants and this place has always been my favorite!  Best chips and salsa! The chips are usually brought out fresh and hot. There is 2 salsa types (mild and hot). I like to mix the mild and hot. My kids eat the mild. So it's not too spicy at all! Burrito Fundito with pollo is the best. But I have also had the pollo quesadilla. Love the enchiladas and tostadas. Basically everything is good!! Margaritas are good. Beer on draft comes in HUGE glass. I ordered a beer and when it got delivered I had to just laugh at the huge glass."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Always good service, fast and friendly. Good food, one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"They have a surprising amount of vegetarian options, just stick w green sauce as the red sauces are beef based. Love their salsa, it all seems to be cooked rather than fresh but I still enjoy it, and just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"So bummed to be giving this rating.... I was a former fan of Valle Luna and was a frequent customer at the Cave Creek location. The restaurant was a meet up place for both family and friends for several years. My sister (who is an excellent cook) visits a few times a year from out of state and particularly enjoys their fundido. I moved to east Mesa a few years ago, but we made the trek last night over to north Phoenix to meet up with family at the Cave Creek Valle Luna. The service was painfully apathetic. We'd been seated a good 10-15 minutes and had to specifically request chips and salsa. There were no queries as to whether or not we wanted drink refills (after waiting a really long time to get our very basic drinks of water and cola). It took so long for my cousin to get her after dinner coffee that we could have ground the beans one at a time by hand and waited for an industrial sized urn to brew. The fundido was still good, but the refried beans that were one of the sides were actually scorched. What kind of reputable restaurant allows scorched food to be served? I won't be making the 30+ mile trip back in the future and am sad to lose this piece of a family tradition and a formerly great spot to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Our server Alexis W was awesome! Very attentive and friendly. She complimented my mom for her PCH shirt and also was super appreciative. Only thing is that my beans were over cooked and stuck to my plate and also I think the restaurant is too compact."}
{"text":"What a great evening. Came to celebrate with a friend and the evening consisted of the staff cussing, playing grab ass and slapping each other with towels all while yelling profanities. The \"manager\" DJ simply said sorry and that she \"didn't know that was happening\". How are you managing your staff if you don't know what they are doing as they are yelling this in the dining area for my table and multiple others to hear. Poorly handled! I could go to Taco Bell and have better customer service for a 1/6 of the price. So disappointed. I did not even eat my dinner.  It was packed up and paid the $80 bill."}
{"text":"We went there a couple of nights ago. We always enjoy there food and their chips were extra good. If the recipe changed, please keep it! Service was just ok. We'll return again."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at Valle Luna. I grew up going to this location and the one on Cave Creek. The food is always fresh and of good quality. The wait staff is amazing and on the ball with refilling of chips, salsa, and drink orders. The newer location in Chandler is right off of the water and has excellent food as well. We highly recommend any of these locations for a great meal."}
{"text":"okay...where to start. I drive past this spot every day, and it is always busy!  WOW! I'm thinking this place must be hella good Mexican to be so busy. I gotta try that place sometime.  My friend gave me a gift card so I went alone for a lunch/ test drive. I was excited! I ordered the most expensive item on the menu. Steak and Chicken Fajitas $14.95 and ala carte chicken enchilada.  I should have left when there was a hair in my salsa but I know shit happens and let it go back with the server.  Here come my Fajitas!!  SIZZLING platter of 90% ONIONS.  ONIONS!!  I had to dig for the few scraps of beef jerky and boiled chicken. I'm not kidding. And I did make a tortilla and try it......one bite was too much.   Well, at least I had my enchilada right? I was so bland that it couldn't have been more than boiled chicken...no seasoning at all.  The worst meal of my life.  I tipped the poor server 20% figuring she had a hard enough life working there.  I will never go back"}
{"text":"I have been going here since 1988. It is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. You must try the carne asada taco dinner, you will fall in love with it. You can always tell if the place is going to be good by the chips and salsa and yes they have the best."}
{"text":"Always a good beer and awesome food! Haven't seen any better place yet!!! Great flavor and service. Worth to try"}
{"text":"I love their Happy Hour. My husband and I come and have a couple of apps, and a couple of Corona most Friday nights. We sit in the Cantina. The service is wonderful, the food is fabulous,  and the beer is always cold."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food place around! I have been going to Valle Luna since I was a kid and the food is always up to par. You know what you are getting when you go. Sometimes the service can be streaky but overall one of the better places to go.   Last time i tried their Cheese crisp extraordinaire. It was freaking amazing. I love when you pile steak, bell peppers, cream cheese, onions, and more into a cheese crisp."}
{"text":"This place is ahhhhmazing!! Their chips are to die for and tacos, mmmmmm!!!! Definitely recommend this place and I'm from SD, so I know good Mexican food! Haha"}
{"text":"Update...  After my previous review, I received a message via Yelp from one of the Managers at Valle Luna.  The Manager wanted to let me know that the reviews on Yelp are read, and that the situation my Wife and I encountered would be taken care of.  I was impressed that Management contacted me to address my concerns.  So...this past Friday after very warm 18 holes of disc golf at nearby Conocido Park; my group was trying to figure out where to go to lunch.  I suggested Valle Luna; a couple of the guys had never been, but decided they would give it a try.  I love going into a cool, dark restaurant after being outdoors in the Arizona sun, and Valle Luna doesn't disappoint in this.  We sat in the Cantina area, and chips, salsa, and drinks arrived quickly.  3 of us had tacos; 2 had chicken, 1 had beef, and we were happy with our choices.  Once again, I'm not sure how Valle Luna seasons and prepares their taco meat, but it is very tasty and I think I could live on them. I also had a side of rice and black beans with my lunch.  The rice was moist and tasty, and the black beans have a nice flavor and give a good alternative to the standard refried beans.  1 in the group had the chimichanga lunch special.   He was happy and I believe he took food home (it was huuuuuge).  The last member of the group had a burrito bowl, it looked good; but he didn't say much.  I will say that it was empty when he was done.  The service and the food were great, as they usually are. I'm pretty confident that my disc golf group will be putting Valle Luna on our Friday lunch roster."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and Aaron waited on us. We are vegan and he helped usfigure out what menu items we could eat. Thanks so much. It's often difficult to eat at restaurants for us so we really appreciated your kindness."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $36. Paid $23. I'm always so excited to eat the food that I forget to take a picture until I'm like six bites deep. Sign up for their email club and get this deal :) The fact that I can't order the fundido burrito á la cart and I'm forced to order some sort of side or over pay is ridiculous. There should be an option to order every entrée á la cart. The two times we have been to this location we have had the same server, she's been there 13 years and really knows her menu."}
{"text":"The staff in the Cantina is TOP NOTCH! We have been coming to Luna for over 8 years and never been disappointed. Favorite foods include Pepe's Border Tacos, Fajitas, Fundido, and Taco Basket. I crave their Luna Ritas!   Thank you Cantina for all the love and taking such great care of our family all these years!"}
{"text":"Best huevos Rancheros I have ever had. That potato cake underneath is like a crack-patty!!"}
{"text":"Mexican food.  I confess, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, except when I am actually in Mexico.  We went for lunch.  They gave us chips and salsa to munch on.  I ordered the burro de la Casa... what is that, the house burrito?  It just seems that no matter what I order in a Mexican restaurant, it seems to all taste the same - Rice, ripped up meat. beans, cheese, and some type of bread product to wrap it all together.  If you like Americanized Mexican food, you might like this place."}
{"text":"I frequent this Valle Luna often because my grandmother loves it. It has been one of her favorite restaurants for over 3 decades and what grammie wants grammie gets.   The gradual decline in the customer service has become painfully obvious over the years. The food usually arrives in different intervals, and often before we get our silverware. The tables are so close together you have to practically scream to hear your dining partners. The salsa is flavorful yet has no spice, and the last cheese crisps we ordered were soggy and undercooked. The silverware is disgusting, they've obviously been using it for over 30 years.   We went last night and observed one of the most incompetent and rude hosts in history. He was a smart ass teenage blond boy that kept pronouncing peoples names wrong. I watched as he past over two separate groups due to the mispronunciations (can he not read his own writing?) I couldn't take it anymore and hipped them to the situation, he responded with indignant rudeness instead of apologies. Luckily for him the group was half tanked from sitting in the bar so they waited to be seated before complaining.   Now all this aside. Valle Luna makes the best grilled pork chimichanga I have ever tasted. Hands Down. Order it, gain 5 pounds, thank me later.   5 star chimi, 1 star service, = 3 star review."}
{"text":"This place has grown to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley. It is close to my house, the prices are good, service is always friendly, and the food is tasty. My favorite is their fajita salad. I know, a salad at a Mexican restaurant. But I just love them! I always eat my husbands side of rice and beans on his plate, and stuff myself on the chips beforehand, but I'm not the only one, right? Anyway, they've been around a long time, so Valle Luna is tried and true. Try it out."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for ok mexican food.  Service is ok. Mens bathroom needed a complete cleaning at 2 pm as it was completely wrecked."}
{"text":"Taco salads are no longer in a flower bowl. They are regular with a few flower tortilla chips on the side with watery chicken. Very disappointed. When we addressed it with the server they didn't ask if we wanted anything in substitution.... I used to work at Valle Luna and this was an awful food/service  experience."}
{"text":"We love the food here and come regularly. The mini taco basket is delicious and the steak fundido (despite being heavy) is amazing! Can't get enough of their spicy salsa either. The waiters and bussers are all friendly and helpful.   The only complaint we have is the rudeness of the host staff. It seems like, without fail, every time we come in they act as if we are a major inconvenience. If it wasn't for the delicious food and the fact that the restaurant is so close to our home, the hostesses would be enough to make us not come back."}
{"text":"So a friend said that I have to stop here while in Phoenix. Normally I wouldn't show up at a chain but figured I would give him the benefit of the doubt. Headed to the bar. Cute atmosphere but way too dark.   So my friend suggested the shredded beef tacos. Unfortunately they were excessively fatty and lacked flavor. I did like that it was served on a hot plate to keep the beans warm throughout.  Their rice was excellent and had a solid flavor.   Good service but nothing special."}
{"text":"Went on a Tues night and it was packed at 4:45. We managed to find a booth much to the our own amazement since people were standing every where. Our waitress was really great, friendly, helpful, and happy even in a packed house.  We ordered margaritas and apps and everything came really fast.  Food was pretty good and  came while still hot. Could stand some hotter sauce and chips, but overall we were satisfied and left stuffed.  Parking is hard to come by and the lot was packed.  We will go back again, but not on a seniors or family day."}
{"text":"Time for an update from 3-star to 1-star. So what happened? Well, on my last visit, they dropped the ball enough times that I couldn't believe it. For starters, our server shows up after a several minutes of my wife and I starring into space, then asks us, \"How long have you guys been here? Has it been long? I didn't see anyone over here.\"   Excuse me? This is how you introduce yourself to customers, by telling them you're a clueless idiot that has no idea how long they've been sitting there? Wow.  So we order our food and, never getting any chip refills (although the server happily took our empty basket and didn't bother asking if we wanted more), we finally get our food. Surprise surprise, my wife's Luna Burger, requested to be cooked \"well done\" shows up as pink throughout and literally dripping in grease, to the point where it was borderline inedible. Worse yet, the fries that came with it were nasty. Think shoe leather, soaked in grease but not fried long enough to be crisp. Absolutely revolting. To add insult to injury, the tomato slice included with the burger was over half an inch thick. Twice as thick as the burger itself? Really??? Come on.  Since the server never returned, I lost my patience and went around looking for her. I find her out front by the reception area, nowhere near our section. I tell her I was wondering if she was ever coming back, since we had a food problem at our table. \"Oh, I was coming back, I was just ...\" yeah, whatever. I don't want to hear your excuses. What I wanted to hear was an apology, but that was not forthcoming, because naturally it's not the server's fault that she's vanished, right? Lame.  Server asks my wife if she wants a new burger, to which she responds no. She instead asks if she can just have the chicken salad, that's pretty simple and hard to screw up and she was no longer in the mood for still-mooing hamburger. Instructed the server, \"No cheese on the salad (Parmesan), no dressing,\" and she writes both down before scurrying off. Says not to worry about the dressing, it's always on the side anyway, but she'll tell them no dressing. Returns shortly after to say the salad will be out soon, and the manger (who had not the stones to come to the table personally) was very sorry for the dog food they tried to serve my wife. Real classy when you send the server to apologize for you.   Fast forward about 10 minutes. Another manager shows up, salad in hand. Puts it down in front of my wife, who, flabbergasted, points out that not only is there cheese all over it, but it is slathered in dressing. What part of NO didn't they understand? This is where it gets brilliant. The manager blames the server, saying she keyed it in wrong and was confused with another salad where the dressing typically comes on the side. She takes it back to make another one. The server shows up and, true to form, blames someone else, namely the manager! \"My manager just didn't pay attention to the ticket and didn't notice the no cheese, no dressing,\" she tells us. OK, as long as you folks can get your story straight.   All the while, I have barely touched my food, wanting my wife to get something edible first. Nobody, not one person, asked if they should bring me something new since my food had been sitting idle for almost 30 minutes by the time this fiasco had run its course. The server did ask me how I liked the spinach enchillada though, which was funny since I hadn't taken a single bite of it and obviously had no way of knowing what it tasted like. Apparently an IQ test is not part of the hiring process at this place.   Finally, my wife gets her replacement salad. The manager, who said she'd comp our entire meal for this fiasco (though I said she didn't need to) did not keep her word either. I was charged basically fully price for my cold-by-the-time-I-ate-it food and my wife's salad. They comped off the burger and the 1st salad (how generous, since they botched both and we didn't eat them), but left on my food and the constantly-run-dry drinks that weren't refilled adequately the entire night.   The server tried to give me back my coupon, saying I could re-use it the next time. I gave it back to her and told her to keep it, we weren't going back. I reminded her that we'd been going to this location for upwards of 7 years and this was by far the worst service and worst food we've ever gotten in all that time. Her response, \"Meh, okay,\" basically, and then off she went after leaving our change. I did not feel bad at ALL about leaving her a $.01 tip and calling back later to vent my frustrations on the manager.   This is the best part. The manager, Craig, tells me that the server, Rosemary, is apparently a \"problematic server\" and he's aware of the issue. Why in God's name is she still working there then? I asked how many more customers he has to lose, and he said he was going to ask her that. I told him he can add 2 more to the list, as my wife and I are done with them. Absolutely unreal"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and here is a custom built gem that is my little present for you.  1. Carne Asada Burrito 2. Add Fundido Sauce inside it 3. Enchilada Style (red sauce) 4. Beans and Rice  You are welcome!!!!"}
{"text":"Not authentic mexican food.Food service was not great. Salsa was not fresh. I will not be back again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here. I had the cream cheese burrito and it was amazing! So rich and creamy, i crave it from time to time. The place is respectively clean and the service is decent a little slow though. Salsa is alright, but has a bit of a watered down taste. Yuck. Ill be back for the burrito, but thats about it."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Drinks are weak and not high quality. Homemade tortillas are great."}
{"text":"Tina was an excellent server and replenished our beverages before our drinks were even half empty.  The fajitas were very tasty but didn't have enough meat (combination of steak and shrimp).   The ground beef Mexican pizza had a lot of ground beef that was cooked perfectly and a variety of cheeses as well as green and red peppers and onions.  The chips and salsa were worth the price of admission.  I've had the opportunity to eat here twice now (I live out of town) and can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"I lived in Phoenix for several years and thank the colleague who told me to come try the pollo fundido. When I come back to visit I always makes sure to stop in and get my fix."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food in town. Can get very busy, but they have great specials. The fundidos are awesome. Great hot chips and the salsa is clearly fresh and made daily. I love the giant shrimp they have for fajitas, salads or the fundidos. Taken many people there, no one has ever disliked it. Prices are very reasonable. Wednesday nights kids eat for a buck!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Have been going here for many years. Used to be my dad and me's place to go. With his recently passing away, I still carry on the tradition and go at least once a month!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Seriously the best Mexican food I have had in the valley thus far! Highly recommend their queso! I seriously could drown myself in this stuff! So good!! Their burritos are amazing as well. The food is even great if you get carry out! This place is awesome and others need to take notes because they have it all figured out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Try the cantina for some fun and great happy hour specials. Very affordable and great food!"}
{"text":"We have been customers of this restaurant since it opened years and years ago. The owners are locals who have stayed consistent with quality of food and service through all this time.   The guacamole is fresh made as are hot chips that come to you right away. When you order the meals with shrimp in them, as my mother in law does regularly, there are loads of nice sized shrimp that taste like shrimp. I enjoy green corn tamales and the ones at Valle Luna see delicious.   Families with little ones are welcome as they have clean high chairs as well as bumper seats. Your drinks are in generous size and the refills are free. If you want to substitute grilled vegetables for rice or beans-- no problem--  It is clean. Many of the staff have been there for eons.   My sons grew up eating at this restaurant. Now in their mid thirties with families of their own, when they fly home for a visit we always try to \"work in\" a lunch or dinner.   You can made a meal out if the generous sized appetizers. If you have room for dessert it is hard to pick between the soppellias and the fried ice cream.   The owners offer special Internet coupons regularly and they offer discounts for seniors on certain days. I believe there are discounts for military families. You can call in for \"take out food\". Cinco de Mayo is a blast here but boy is it crowded."}
{"text":"Always have good food. Great service clean. And they have always supported the American Legion Riders when they asked to donate for the Fisher house ride"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and was pleasantly surprised! Being from Los Angeles, I'm used to traditional Mexican food, so I can be a bit picky. My husband heard about Valle Luna from a co-worker and decided to give it a try. We got there around 8pm and husband wanted to sit in the Cantina. Chose a spot, sat down and our server quickly brought us chips and 2 salsa's. The salsa's we're ok. Nothing special. I like spicy and neither of them were. Chips were crisp! Husband ordered a burrito with shredded beef, side of red sauce, rice and beans. I had the chicken taco/chicken enchilada combo in red sauce, side of rice and beans. We both had 2 blended GrammaRita's.  Margaritas were out in 5 minutes. The salt was a little too sweet for my liking, but the margarita itself was delish. It was perfectly blended. Next time I'll order with no salt and a floater of tequila. Our plates came out and both were piping hot! The food was really, really good! Cheesy enchilada, crisp taco and the rice was fluffy. I love the amount of red sauce and cheese they put on my plate! I used those crispy chips to dip in my beans! Tasty goodness! My husband raved about his dish and demolished the entire plate! (That's a good thing!)   Our server was excellent. He was friendly, quick and took the time to introduce the menu to us.  I was told they have Happy Hour M-F 3-7:30 and reverse happy hour from 7:30pm Thurs-Sat? (I'm not 100% sure about reverse hh days.)   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The fajita bowl was mediocre. It lacked the quantity of beef a perfect fajita contain but I must say the beef that was there and the vegetables were cooked very well! The employees were very helpful in menu instruction. I feel that the food is over priced but its a cool restaurant. After I left I realized I had forgotten my sunglasses on the table and went back and were very urgent about finding them."}
{"text":"Great everthing food service drinks..this is great local gem. Been several times. Overall 10 rating.Go see for yourself..#1 Grrat establishment"}
{"text":"Valle Luna sure is great. Love the 32oz beers and the food is the bomb! Best thing about the whole place though is the service. Jared the bartender always greets us warmly. He remembers us every time and always crafts the perfect margarita for my super high maintenance friend! We highly recommend Valle Luna. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We visit Valle Luna once a week.  Good food great service! Thank you \"G MOM\", you are the best!"}
{"text":"Great little mexican food restaurant..... Long waits. Yummy comida"}
{"text":"Came for Thursday night happy hour with the girls. Very very crowded. But enjoyed the drinks and the prices even more!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Valle Luna for many years.  It's a good thing that we travel so far to get here,  or we might go here daily,  which would be hard on the wallet and the waistline!     You can always count on it being because the food is so great.   We have never had anything but great food.  Same is true for the service.  Service normally is fairly fast, but you are never hustled to leave.  Portions are large,  perhaps accounting for slightly higher prices.   They have great specials Tuesday,  Wednesday and Thursday nights.   If you have room for desert,  get their wonderful sopapliias, be sure to ask for the caramel sauce."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Had the shrimp burro and all I can say about it is yuck! This place is great hands down but the food today tasted like garbage. Tortilla had a funky as well as the veggies on the plate. The veggies literally tasted old as heck and tasted as if it was chopped and put away passed its expiration date. Gotta admit beans and rice was good. I'm not even mad though I'm just upset about the experience because I love coming here."}
{"text":"Food is Always Great.... Amazing Happy Hour (til 730 P.M. in the Cantina).  Still Family operated and it Shows.  The staff, as an admitted regular, is amazing and always makes us feel welcome."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this is one of my favorites. Warm, fresh and never ending chips...wonderful salsa. Last night I ordered something different than I usually do (pollo fundido) and it was delicious. It was super busy last night so service and food was slower than it usually is (typically we get our food fast) but our server still managed to stop by and check on us, get us more chips and provide refills. I keep trying other Mex places but this is still the best."}
{"text":"Very good food and reliable service. Prices are good too. Parking and wait time can be a problem on weekend evenings.   I've ordered the Chicken Enchilada casserole several times or parties/functions. It is always a hit!"}
{"text":"They always take good care of me. Staff is awesome. Dominic is an awesome bartender."}
{"text":"For years now it's been my favorite Mexican restaurant. We ate there this last week and were a little disappointed. I still think it's a good place, but the food was a little on the bland side.   I'm hoping this was just due to a different cook during the holidays.   Anyone else experience this?.  Update 12-13-09 Eaten there a few times in the last few weeks. Everything seems to be back up to the quality I'm used to."}
{"text":"Love their mini taco appetizer (mine ordered with beef and extra cheese) and their lunatic sauce is amazing!!  I also love the fundito but it tends to upset my stomach so I only order it when I am really craving it!!"}
{"text":"We go here and Top Shelf a bunch.  It's ok.  I usually get the chimi for dinner and it's great.  Service is usually good.  Can't complain.  Chips and salsa is ok.  Decent place to get average Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been going to one Valle Luna or another for the past 15 years. Their food is standard Mexican-in-Arizona and plentiful for the most part, but guess what I just found out? THEY HAVE GREAT CHICKEN WINGS!   I know, weird, huh? My faves are the honey-hot, fried and grilled."}
{"text":"The food is always great.  The bar has great happy hour specials.  They have excellent machaca beef.  The chimichangas and fajitas are my favorite.  This our \"go to\" mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Party of 3. Seated right away on Sunday around 2:30 pm.  Finally found a place that still fry the tacos.  Really yummy macacha tacos. Liked the cheese enchilada.  Trio dips were pretty good.  Chips crispy and warm.  Two sauces thin slightly spicy and thicker salsa very mild.  House margarita rocks and salt just right.  Funny that someone here said the salt was too sweet.  Must have been a  strawberry one or something.  Sort of slow service today.  Waited a bit for chips and initial server.  I liked overall experience better than Manuels.  Affordable.  Just needed that old AZ Mexican food fix today.  I wonder if La Piñata is still good."}
{"text":"Only reason for the 2 stars is for the service.  The food was not very good at all. My dinner was hardshell taco's or something that consist of hardshell taco's but when they came out the shells were soggy and you couldn't eat them.  The drink specials were good and we had a very nice server."}
{"text":"After eight months, we decided to try Luna one more time.  We went Saturday afternoon for a late lunch.  Service was slow, considering they were not terribly busy.  Chips and salsa much better... hot sauce was horrible.  Fire hot with no flavor.  My husband usually goes through two bottles... he barely touched the first.  Food ordered was tasty, except sour cream missing on my plate, and we waited TEN MINUTES to get silverware and napkins.  Definitely, a slight improvement but still disappointing overall.   Also, why does \"Jesse\" only respond to positive feedback and ignore the rest?  Just sayin.  UPDATE:  After reading \"Jesse's\" response, I can only encourage people to reconsider spending money there.  Instead of proactively addressing customer complaints, even when there are MULTIPLE issues, management prefers to attack long time customers.  Jesse - I'm sorry you are not mature enough to handle constructive criticism.  And using big words like 'rant' only highlights your defensiveness."}
{"text":"BRAD and LYNDSEY took care of our party of 30 last night LIKE CHAMPS!!!  They did an awesome job taking our drink orders and being there refilling them quickly!"}
{"text":"Yelp really needs to offer a 2 1/2-star rating, especially for restaurants, as there are soooooo many places that aren't really bad so much as they're just not that good. Valle Luna is one of those restaurants.  This place offers standard Cali-Mex cuisine exactly like you'll find at hundreds of other places around town. The food is very unremarkable, with everything coming smothered in melted cheese and your choice of green or red sauces (which taste the same anyway).  Plan to pay $1-$3 more per plate than comparable Mexicanized restuarants, however."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and good prices. One of the mexican restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Bell Rd location growing up, but haven't been in years.  We stopped into the Cave Creek location a few months ago and have been going regularly since. Valle is a great traditional, Sonoran-style Mexican restaurant. No-frills but also not a hole in the wall. I have been very impressed with the service and the food. Great Pollo fundido, Carne Asada burritos, tacos, and enchiladas etc.  it beats any of the Mexican restaurant chains hands down, in terms of food quality and taste.   For me, this place is the authentic Mexican food I grew up with and I am incredibly glad I rediscovered Valle Luna."}
{"text":"Always have good food and good service. Need to come early for dinner as they are always busy. Valle Luna is our go to place for sit down Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our waitress Taylor was one of the best we ever had she did her job so well. She has a great, easy going personality. Don't let this one go and give her a raise!"}
{"text":"We arrived to a packed parking lot ultimately making the parking less than ideal. The reason for this? We found out upon entering that Wednesday night is family night, which means there are cheap meals aka deals.   The service was quick and we were seated in 10 minutes. We quickly ordered and the food was steaming hot and out in front of us within minutes of ordering. I ordered a tostada and taco, both with shredded beef. The taco was pretty good, especially considering the price point and the ingredients tasted fresh. The tostada, however, was disappointing as the actual shell it sat on was stale. The people I dined with were quite pleased with their choice of chimichanga as well as the beef and shrimp fajitas.   Between the choice of Taco Bell or this, I'd choose this, but I don't plan on returning unless that choice ever arises."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for so many years maybe every 4 months or so, either with my parents that live in the area or with a group of friends that also live not too far.  Yeah the place is always busy, parking is crazy, etc etc. But i feel its worth it, they have great specials all the time and the dishes I have tried are very good but not amazing. I always get the fajitas or nachos, both are tasty so that is what I stick to. Chips and salsa are good, chips are crisp and the hot salsa isn't really all that hot.   For me Valle Luna is a convenient place to meet, have drinks and catch up with friend and family....get there early or at 5 for the specials."}
{"text":"Not Authentic by any stretch. I ordered the chicken pozole and they did not use the traditional chili peppers which gives pozole it's taste, smell and color. Instead, I got what tasted like Chicken noodle soup with hominy.  We were seated promptly but the waitress took forever to take our order and checking on us and when I asked about the pozole, she replied with \"everyone makes pozole differently.\"  I Didn't know that taking the noodles out of Progresso and adding hominy was a recipe.  Parking was even more of a hassle, only reason I will give them 2 stars is because at least the marg.'s were good and the tamales were half decent."}
{"text":"There is nothing \"authentic\" about this place. The presentation is very nice but the taste is definitely not true. The people of Sonora...we don't use shredded cheese. Puro queso fresco.  If only that was the only set back. The enchilada sauce tasted straight out of the can. The black beans were so dry & stale. The chips were good, the salsa was not. Again, it was as if they opened a jar of Pace Picante & just poured it out. Hostess girls were a bit rude but waitress was totally nice & asked sufficiently if we needed anything. Her service was great. If you read the \"Tia Rita\" story, you know there's foul play at hand. Don't believe the hype. Its embarrassing they claim Sonoran authenticity."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Ordered the taco and tostada combo with rice and beans... The service was quick, the food was great, and the atmosphere was dark and soothing. The building is a little older and slightly run down, but it has character.  One little ding - We got here a little before 11am (when they supposedly open) and they didn't open the front door until 11:05am (per my cell phone). Grrrrrrr - don't get between a hungry man and his tacos!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas here are fantastic!  Pretty authentic Sonoran style food here, which is a big plus if you're looking for that.  Portions are big, chips are great, salsa, although a bit spicy, was great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food with fun bartenders.    I was on a business trip and looking for some excellent and cost effective Mexican food at a local place.  It was suggested I go to this place and what a great choice it was.  Downed a few margaritas and some steak fajitas.  Going home happy and full."}
{"text":"Got a coupon for my birthday and we had to use it! My friend and I ordered the chicken chimi with rice and beans, and a half order of steak nachos to share. Everything was delicious! Enjoyed the chips and salsa, as always, and service was good. Valle Luna has redeemed itself as my favorite Mexican place!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after going to the location on Bell Rd and there was a 45 min wait... on a Tuesday! Yes, it was Senior Night, but that was surprising to me. Maybe everyone is in town for Thanksgiving? Or for the winter (snowbirds)? The wait at Cave Creek ended up being about 20 min. Not bad. The food was pretty consistent with our regular location. The chips were a little oilier than I'm used to, but the chicken chimi (no guac or garnish), rice, and beans were very tasty. In fact, I think the rice was not as dry as the Bell location has been. Got to use our buy one, get one free coupon. I still wish there was a Valle Luna in the west valley! Once a month we drive 24 miles each way to eat at Valle Luna. Would love to have an Avondale/Goodyear location!"}
{"text":"Great stop for tasty mexi food reasonably priced and lively atmosphere . We like the casual atmosphere . I think the sports bar is fun to hang out and watch all the happening"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little kid. Food, staff, and environment is amazing!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say that my memories of Valle Luna didn't meet the current state, however, still pretty darn solid. We used to love to get the family style fajitas which they don't do anymore, but we did order a few plates of fajitas. They were good but very short on meat and long on onions. What was in there was yummy, but not very much.  we enjoyed the meal and 3 stars is A-OK, but I remembered it being more 4-5 star, maybe just the memories were not met. Also Wed is family night so they had some great deals on the menu and you cannot go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"I find coming here risky because I never know if this is the time the food will be good or bad. Tonight it was good. I've been coming to this restaurant for the last 30 years, but it seems this seesaw has been going on for the last 15. I'm promising myself that I will check in here consistently so maybe I can try to figure out what is causing the inconsistency in food quality."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because nothing else is better in town that I have tried. The fundido burrito is delicious ESPECIALLY if you get it with the house chicken instead of shredded chicken. They don't skimp on the ingredients like a lot of places!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING went wrong!  Let me just say that when a waiter stands before a group of diners (there were 14 of us) and says, \"I apologize for butchering your dinner\", you can well imagine that things did not go well.  It took an hour for just some of us to receive our meals at table 1.  My chicken chimi was tasteless.  Imagine shredded, boiled chicken with no seasoning.  It was mushy and greasy and I felt sick before even leaving the restaurant.  Table 2 waited another 35-40 mins and all of their meals were wrong.  They continued to wait and finally more food came out, some of which was fine.  Some was not.  Food was only warm.  Some orders had to be put in yet again.  The waiter kept double-talking and glossing over that little fact.  He mumbled.  He called the women customers \"sweetheart\" and said other inappropriate things.  I don't know if there were kitchen problems or if this was a waiter problem, but I hope the owner and manager reads this and learns from it.  This was my singularly worst dining experience...ever."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks back and simply got too busy to do this review.   I went with my wife prior to her going to work for a dinner. I've heard this place was one of the best in Phoenix and have been trying to come here for the past 10 years. I'm glad I finally managed it, but upset that it took so long.  I was immediately struck by the decor in the place. It is unique, yet what I would expect. I did like it quite a bit though.  The chips and salsa were very good and I had to get some to go. I've never felt compelled to do that before, so that should say something.  I had the steak Chimichanga dinner with a shredded beef taco on the side. The taco was to die for. It was perfect! The shredded beef was actually better than the steak and if I order it again I will skip the steak.  My wife had the Fundido and ordered it with Chicken. She received steak. She didn't mind because she thought it was so good. We did let the waitress know, but that was all we heard about it. Once she tried my taco, she came to the same conclusion - the steak is good, but the shredded beef is much better!  Overall I can't say this was my favorite place, but it certainly was good and I will return."}
{"text":"Okay, Valle Luna is not going to win any awards for being a \"great\" Mexican restaurant.  Is it bad?  Hell no!  That is evident by the fact that it is rare that you can go there any night of the week and find a parking space in a pretty spacious lot.  That, more than reviews, tells you a lot.  If you build it, people will come.  There is actually nothing wrong with Valle Luna.  The people who work there range from good to a few who are very good.  We have almost never been seated immediately but the wait isn't that bad.  The \"waiting room\" is a bit weird, with uncomfortable benches forcing everyone to kinda stare at each other.  The drinks are good, tasty and not bad for the price.  One of the salsas tends toward an 8 out of 10 rating.  The food is typical Americanized Mexican fare for the most part, but definitely plentiful ... I have never been able to finish it all without resorting to a doggie bag.  The decor is decent, the multiple dining rooms help keep the noise down.  The clientele ranges from attractive young singles to those in the senior range and there is a good mix of couples-to-small groups.  They rate 4-stars because they are most definitely a cut above any \"chain\" Mexican place I have visited in Phoenix and yet also manage to outdo many of the mom & pop local places due to their cleanliness and consistency.  They are almost, but not quite, one of the best in Phoenix in my book.  My 4-star rating compares them to other restaurants in the Phoenix area.  If I rated them against restaurants I have visited in Mexico, San Diego, El Paso and a few other places I would drop them to a 3-star rating and if I rated them against a couple of my favorite ever places, regardless of location, price, cleanliness, etc. they might fall to a 2-star.  But then again I have only found a total of less than the fingers on my right hand that would rate a solid 5-star."}
{"text":"Great prices, Best Mexican food if you are on Bell rd. and need a quick lunch.  Really good for families and kids."}
{"text":"I wish we had a closer Valle Luna to our home, but this one is worth the drive.  I bought a gift certificate from restaurant.com and took my 3 kids to this restaurant for a night out with mommy. I hadn't been there in years.  The waiter was prompt at keeping my massive amounts of iced tea flowing, and was very nice.   I ordered the pollo fundido and it was fabulous. Whatever seasoning they use on the chicken was so tasty. It was probably the best pollo fundido I've ever had. Chips and salsa and my kids' food was great as well.   I've been eating here for over 10 yrs, and I never really enjoyed it all that much until this experience. I will definitely be back with another gift certificate :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food? YES. Happy Hour deals all day on Sunday? YES.  Several TVs strategically placed for optimal viewing pleasure no matter where you are seated. You betcha. Pleasant crowd gathering, cold beer flowing, crispy tortilla chips crunching are just some of the highlights you will experience whilst dining at Luna!   *I can only give my feedback for the bar section, because that's the only place I've dined."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites!!! I'm so picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants! Extremely picky!!! My husband and I have been to a handful and while there's more places we've not yet tried around us, this place takes the cake so far! The food is so yummy! Portions are great! Nice drink specials and super service!! Reminds me of our favorite place back home!!! Everyone has to have their favorite Mexican Restaurant and for us..we finally found one here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We've only been in Arizona for a year, as everyone knows when you move to a new state you need to refind new reasrurants, a friend and several neighbors have raved about this place, so of all nights I decided to go on Cinco de Mayo. We walked in to place our to go order. The girls were great, they may have been frustrated and overwhelmed by how busy they were, but they kept their cool, very professional, and polite. My family wolfed down the food, it was great. I will definitely be going back again. I spent the same amount of money for dinner for the 3 of us as I would have at McDonald's, and way better food."}
{"text":"The hostess first words to us were \"follow me\". Then she took us to a table where we sat for 15 minutes with no service. A nice young lady noticed our lack of service and upset demeanor and took matters in her own hand. She moved us to her section and the rest of our experience was OUTSTANDING!  She went above and beyond to make our dining experience an awesome one! You need to make that girl a manager! Thank you Courtney for picking up the slack of your colleagues, you're an awesome server and the main reason I'll come back to Valley luna again!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant. I've been coming here since I was little when I came with my grandparents. They have terrific food and great happy hour specials. We've also come to know several of their wonderful employees and look forward to seeing them. Our favorite bartender, Ryan, not only makes amazing drinks but keeps us laughing the entire time we're in the Cantina. We are there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   The service is great and the food is better...I always have the pollo foundito (hope I spelled that right)...it's a great place to bring out of town visitors if you want to share a unique Arizona restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been going to Valley Luna for 20 years now and it is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the Valley. It beats out any other Mexican Restaurant that I have been to, in the 2 other states that I have previously lived in, for many years, Chicago and Southern California to be exact. I love the friendly service and great salsa. The bartender that has worked there for over 20 years is the best at what he does. You will always laugh and be extremely satisfied with the food and service from Ian, that works the bar! Thanks for being such a great place to frequently visit!"}
{"text":"Of course everyone knows the food is great but what earns the 5 stars is their server Corina! On many occasions I've been blown away by her attentiveness, kindness and overall attitude. I love this restaurant, their beef taco and especially appreciate Corina's hard work! Best service I've ever had hands down."}
{"text":"I love Valle Luna. I can't eat tomatoes at all or spicy foods which is a bummer because I LOVE Mexican food. I order the fajitas as they don't have a lot of hot peppers and red sauce but DOES have good flavor.  I have had the chicken and the beef fajitas and love both.  The chicken is mild with almost no heat but good spice flavor. The beef is tender and has a little heat but not too much that I can eat it without any issues.  The onions and peppers that come with it are done very well not too soggy but not crisp. The seasonings they use are true seasonings that don't affect my allergies. Many Mexican restaurants use an all spice that stuffs up my nose right away but not Valle Luna, I am very happy about this :)  For the food restrictions I have Valle Luna is a place I can enjoy Mexican food."}
{"text":"The waitress Taylor was amazing, great service. She was happy and smiling.   The meal was delicious; albondiagas and street tacos.   The salsa music was not too loud."}
{"text":"Fundido is amazing but, prices seem to go up and up. I honestly. An not bring myself to pay almost 20.00 for one any more. Luna does have great coupons like buy one entree get one free though so hubby's and I will get fundidos and I don't feel so guilty. I worked at luna in high school and I have no problem eating there ;) other places such as pei Wei and quiznos I wil never eat in again lol!"}
{"text":"Top 2 joints to go too. Good happy hour and good environment. Excellent food at a great price"}
{"text":"I'd have to say that out of all the Mexican places I've tried in the Valley thus far, including non-chain places, this is definitely the best!!  Wonderful food, generous portions.  We frequent this place at least 2-3 Fridays a month and have tried about 1/2 of the items on the menu.  Usually taco salads don't do much for me, but this one is actually good!  Chips/salsa are very good (especially with the hot sauce), fundito is amazing, cheese crisp extravaganza is fantastifc.  I've noticed many of their best items are served with jalapeno cream cheese, which really is addictive.  I'm fairly certain this is why ppl have so many cravings for Valle Luna.  Never had any service issues here.  Building is very old but adds to the authentic ambiance.  Have never come during happy hour or sat in the bar area, just the dining areas (there are several \"rooms\" which is nice and changes things up a bit if you come here often).  The only negative is that sometimes it gets a bit loud w/kids running everywhere, but overall a very pleasant, casual place for any occasion.  restaurant.com offers a $25 gift card for just a couple bucks, and all you have to do is spend $35 (and some of this can be on alcoholic drinks!) So you end up getting $35 worth of food/drinks for about $20-25 with tip.  Not bad!  Val-pak also has buy 1, get 1 free entree coupons almost every time, but even without discounts, the prices aren't too high.  Granted, I definitely wouldn't come here as often if discounts weren't available though."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and have enjoyed our meals thoroughly. The service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I always get my hopes up when I go to Valle Luna, then I am inevitably disappointed.  The service is fine, and the food is not terrible, but it is very heavy and I usually feel like there's a rock in my stomach afterwards.  I love greasy Mexican as much as the next person, but I'd rather go for the flavor profiles you get at Macayo's or Carlos O'Briens."}
{"text":"This is more so an updated review. The Enchilada meat has changed and is now like chewing string leather. This used to be my go to place for enchiladas, but now I will be looking elsewhere. I've complained about this, but never received a definitive answer as to why it's different.   I will say this though, their happy hour wings and tacos are stellar! I will keep coming back for those"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and the food is pretty consistent. Basic Mexican food decently cooked. The Chimi's are great and the service has always been very good.   Why 3 Stars ?  Their Chimis are good for the price, but not my #1 Chimi... Their \"free\" chips and salsa are ok, chips kind of THICK, but hey, free... Last order was the Chili Relleno, and the batter was meh...  I will be back, but this isnt a normal stop for me. Gotta be craving some Mexican food, and not feel like driving to Carolinas or Abuelos, which, u should find my reviews for them....   Still better than Macayos n Garcias, but just shy of 3.5 stars for me...."}
{"text":"I've had the Pollo Fundido and the Beef Fundido (on different visits) and loved them both! So delicious! I've also tried the Albondigas (Meatball soup) and it was also very good. The Fried Ice Cream was a very yummy finish."}
{"text":"Fondida had a good flavor, but lacked MEAT. Glad we tried this place because we have heard many recommendations. However, we won't be back because of the uncomfortable atmosphere and employee discontent. Popo's still reigns the west valley Mexican food."}
{"text":"Extra delicious today. Not one fault even on a busy holiday. Hot fresh food and lots of flavor. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Awesome cheese crisp and cool atmosphere very good authentic Mexican food margaritas on point"}
{"text":"We used to come to this place all the time but they changed their menu and increased their prices. Had been quite a while since we've come back but on Easter not much was open. We decided to give it another shot and I'm glad we did, it was delicious.  Tacos were as they should be -where they deep fry the tortillas themselves. I also got an enchilada with green sauce which was very tasty. My husband got the red chili burrito with green sauce, also very good.  Everything came out as ordered and we were very pleased with the service. One of the only margaritas on the happy hour menu was a raspberry margarita which isn't usually my favorite, but turned out to be really good."}
{"text":"Lunch visit to Valley Luna with coworkers, servicer was training so service was good.  Did take a bit to receive food, taco was cold but meat was flavorfull. Cheese enchilada was hot and good."}
{"text":"Great service-our waitress Denise did an excellent job of taking care of our party of six. They serve the best chimichangas here in town."}
{"text":"Love going here, used to go once a week we moved so try to get there as often as we can, always asked for Taylor because she is excellent, friendly, efficient and always had our order correct! The rest of the staff we had on Taylor's days off were always great to. The food is always great!"}
{"text":"Crazy wait but that's fine its spring training but when my pepe's Sizzling fajita entree comes out Cold and with barley any meat and also costs 14.95 along with our server not knowing anything about menu items when asked, well I would have to say they have failed.only thing good here is the margaritas and damn they were good"}
{"text":"Everyone tells me all the time that this is the best Mexican food in town and I have to try it because it's delicious and all the above. So, I did. Everything just went wrong from the moment I walked in. It started off with my beverage. It took forever to come. Ordering our entree was long. So i ordered a vegetarian burrito. Not what I ordered. I'm a vegetarian, And it had MEAT in it. I was really upset. Good thing I pick the hell out of it. And the girl told me that it was happy hour and she suggested the margarita on the rocks. And I did. She said it was cheaper and bigger. Of course you pick that right? But of course it wasn't. She didn't seem like she wanted to work there.  So much for the hype that people were talking about!"}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time and had a very pleasant experience! Our waitress was very friendly! I got the prickly pear margarita and my boyfriend got the \"white death\" one. Both were delicious! Despite the restaurant being pretty crowded, we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for a table and our food came out pretty fast.   Cons: there is very limited parking here. We ended up parking in the strip mall area next door because we couldn't find an empty spot."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  So....my birthday is coming up in a few days.  What does that mean?  Free stuff from restaurants ;-)!  I received a coupon in my inbox for a free combo meal from Valle Luna during the week of my birthday.  I decided to cash it in on Tuesday.  This place is right near work and I'm surprised I had never been until today.    I took a seat and ordered a Coke to drink...turns out it was Pepsi.  I'm not one of those people who will refuse to drink the other \"cola\" but the waitress still could have at least mentioned that it was Pepsi instead of Coke.  Anyways........  While I was waiting for my drink, the bus boy dropped off a thing of chips.  It was pretty skimp.  It was a small wooden bowl with maybe 10 chips in it.  The chips were just ok...a tad greasy.  The salsas were good at least.  About those chips though.......during my meal, never got offered a refill on them.  The bus boy dude was slammed and was working his ass off the whole time there, but at least swing back buy and offer a refill of chips...know what I'm saying?  During this time, I placed my order for a Combo #8 which was 2 tacos, rice and beans.  I went with shredded beef for my tacos (other choices were ground beef, chicken and a few other options).  Here is how they were...........  Combo #8 (2 tacos, rice and beans)- My waitress delivered this plate to my table and said the magic words of, \"Be careful, that plate is hot\".  Damn skippy, it was!  That is a good sign though...you know your food will be hot and wasn't sitting around.  I took a bite of the rice first.  I'm usually not the biggest rice and beans fan, but they looked delicious so I tried them out.  They were great!  Nice fluffy rice, good refried beans, not too runny or thick...perfect middle ground texture.  I will usually order a la carte and skip these items, but I'm glad I tried them because they were delicious.  I dug into my tacos next.  These tacos were super crispy and fried really well.  You know when the meat is hanging out the side of the taco, and it gets fried and crispy?  Yup..these tacos were like that.  They tasted great!  The only bad thing was that the shells fell apart kind of easily and I was trying to hold them together for a few of the last bites.    Overall, it is hard to complain about a free lunch!  The service was friendly enough but the lack of a refill of chips really made me frown.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that has failed to hook up the chips!  Oh well... everything else was pretty good and for the grand total of $2.71 (plus a nice sized tip), it was an enjoyable lunch.  I am not racing to come back, but I'm sure I will be here again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Mexican food!  Started eating here when I just a kid and have been enjoying it ever since. I no longer live in Phoenix but I stop here every time I am home. The hot sauce is amazing and so are the chips and salsa. They make great margaritas and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico, and a lover of fine Mexican food from various regions, I am pretty particular about my Mexican food. It has to be just as good or better than I can make at home. I was pleasantly pleased with my visit to Valle Luna (Bell). I sat at the bar and it was hoppin'. Lots of people from their seemingly popular Happy Hour. My beer was cold, and the bar tenders attentive even though they were busy. When my chips and salsa arrived I was told one was hot and the other not as hot. I couldn't tell the difference other than one was chunky the other smooth and one had cumin and the other more cilantro. I was later told the smooth one is their Hot one. But I wasn't complaining I enjoyed both salsas and the fresh chips made in house. I ordered the Shrimp stuffed Poblano peppers. I was half expecting just a couple of mini salad shrimp but loved that this was stuffed with several good sized shrimp. The rice was just the way I like it and the refried beans were perfect. I will be going again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and just haven't had the chance to review it.  I always thought the food was great. I normally get the carne asada burrito and it is definitely good. My girlfriend gets two carne asada tacos and she loves it! Everything comes out nice and hot. The beef is seasoned well and the dish itself, at least for the burrito, looks very appetizing (the tacos come out wrapped in foil). The service is decent and not great because they are usually very crowded. The margarita is apparently very strong. I only took a sip of my girlfriend's just to try it and thought $5 was well worth the price. She was buzzing by the end of the night even though she ate.  I have yet to try their other dishes and drinks but I will be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Go for the Happy Hour (too bad it's only in the Cantina which is always slammed) or don't go. We always have a blast there.  Can't say anything about the restaurant because i haven't eaten in it, but I did walk through once and do agree with another, that it was dirty and looking like a tornado blew through."}
{"text":"I love this place me and my sis go here everyweek for girls night out !!!! We love the food and the service everyone there knows us and is so helpful and friendly the fajitas and sopapias are the best in town. It's great for large parties or dinner for two . They have weekly specials almost everynight of the week and yummy drinks too. Must go if you havent been yet!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are good.  Great Mexican food, close by.  Had fajitas.  The decor could be updated and service at first is a bit slow, overall-good."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with this place. I cant keep going to the same mexican place for dinner all the time so have to change it up every now and then. Valle Luna is about 2nd or 3rd on our list so oddly enough I had not reviewed it. All of their food is good, only downside is there margaritas arent the best.  Been coming here forever with my family and now with my own, My 1997 little league baseball team picture is on the wall which is always a good laugh. Thanks for the sponsorship back in the day!!!!!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna was a good experience with family friends in town.  There was large group of us and they seated us in a private type room, it was fantastic!  Especially since we were visiting with family friends that we have not seen in a long time and we could hear each other.  There were kiddies too with us and they had a nice kid's menu.    The food was good, nothing out of this world, but good.  Service was like the food, good.    The parking was a pain though, not a very big lot for such a big crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is always busy but well worth the wait. Once at the table, the service was fast. I had the cheese and chicken enchilada plate and the prickly pear margarita. It was all delicious. I can't wait to go back and try something else off the menu!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place on Thursday's Summer is a awesome server and the food is great their happy hour pricing is really good along with the daily and weekly specials"}
{"text":"Cute place for locals in the area looking for American-Mexican. I do not recommend going out of your way to come here. Horrible parking. Salsa was not good. Didn't taste fresh. Hot sauce was good but not hot at all, just different. This food is in no way shape or form \"authentic Mexican.\" 90% of the customers are Caucasian and have probably never even been to Mexico. Food was just okay. If you've been to any of the tons of American-Mexican restaurants out here, they're all pretty much the same. Service was pleasant but nothing special."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were looking for somewhere close to grab some Mexican food while I was visiting the area, and we made the unfortunate mistake of stopping into Valle Luna. The food was some of the worst quality Mexican food we have ever had. We ordered the dip trio to start- guacamole, queso, bean dip- nothing special. Not to mention the salsa, which was the taste equivalent of a Pace picante sauce from a jar. For our entrees we had shrimp enchiladas and shredded chicken tacos-- both were lacking in flavor and quality. The enchiladas were swimming in grease and the taco shells were over fried and the chicken inside was dry. I wish I could report that the drink we ordered was a positive part of our experience, but it made the whole night that much worse. We ordered a house \"margarita\" on the rocks-- it was watered down and severely lacking flavor. My fiancé added in at least four wedges of lime just to make the drink tolerable.  I'm not sure if it was the timing of our visit (~8:15 on a Wednesday night), but we were extremely disappointed. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Worst $45 I have ever spent."}
{"text":"Dined at Valle Luna while visiting AZ. The restaurant was pretty busy, especially for a Thursday night. The parking lot was pretty crowded so I took that as a good sign. Inside, the place was very dated, it reminded me of the type of Mexican restaurants we would go to in Los Angeles back in the 80's. Our server was friendly and attentive. She was helpful with suggestions, and when my daughter did not eat her sliders because she did not like them, she kindly offered to replace her meal, and in the end, it was taken off the bill. They kept the chips and salsa coming, and those were pretty good! Now, the meal itself was unfortunately not so good. I ordered a cup of chicken pozole and a chile relleno a la carte. I realize that different dishes are prepared different ways depending on the region of Mexico that they are made in, so I was especially curious to try the pozole. While it wasn't bad,  I didn't care for it. The broth was rather greasy and the chunks of tomato in it seemed odd to me. Like I said, not bad, but it just didn't taste like the pozole I am used to. The chile relleno (although I must say that 2 other members of our party had the same and they really enjoyed it), was not the best I've had. It was drowned in a sauce that reminded me of canned tomato sauce and covered in an excessive amount of cheddar and white cheese. I hate yellow or orange cheese anywhere on my Mexican food! I also overheard the waitress describe their queso fundido, saying that they use a jalapeño cream cheese mixture for it...this is not queso fundido. Well, I can see how this place would be popular with people who are accustomed to eating their Mexican food covered in yellow cheese, but this is not authentic Mexican food...not in my opinion."}
{"text":"The mexi-ameri-menu you expect. Not really anything especially bad or especially nice to say. Chips warm and fresh, but salsa was kind of \"jar-of picante-like\" bleh. Large portion. Great coupon."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! My husband and I went on Mother's Day and was seated within 15 minutes. Their strawberry Margaritas were delish. And my husband got their Sunday bloody Mary's ($3.50) and enjoyed every last sip!   Their salsa is just enough spice/heat and their tacos were juicy and flavorful.   Either my favorite or, at the least, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town.   Service was immaculate too. The restaurant is HUGE. Now I know where to go to unwind and throw back a couple margs!!"}
{"text":"IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM NO STARS, I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT! DO NOT COME HERE!!! We had a bad experience in the Bell Rd location, I came home and sent an e-mail complaint in and was IGNORED! I sent in a second complaint and was sent back a LONG letter attacking my complaint in the first place. I have news for these OWNERS- With customer service like this you will close soon. One thing BILL said to me was no one else complained about that nights service. I can tell you with complete confidence, no one else may have complained but I guarantee there were other people that will just not come back. THE LETTER THAT CAME BACK WAS RUDE, AGGRESSIVE, SELF INDULGENT AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Terrible that they have such an inflated self ego that they do not care and even worse yet feel inclined to attack anyone who did not like their experience at this establishment. Shame on Bill and Janie RIddle"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is always good and you can't beat it! Their chunky salsa and chips are the best. I like their melon margarita and vegetarian fundido. I've been going here since I was a little girl. Birthdays here are a tradition. Try their Mexican ice cream or flan. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because the food is fantastic.. however- we walked in and were being walked to a table, and I asked if we could sit in a booth instead (there are 4 booths open), and the lady said, no, we like to keep our booths for the bigger parties. Um excuse me? If I'm a paying customer here for drinks and lunch, and I specifically ask you to not be seated at a table and you tell me no, has to be the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Very disappointed because the food is great, but I won't support a business that has terrible customer service  **I changed to 4 stars because management did reach out to me and apologized."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  This past time the service we had was above and beyond.  Even more amazing was it was Cinco de Mayo and our server was still on top of it.  The food is good- it's standard Mexican food, but they now have street tacos here.  Chips and salsa are above average.  I wish they had a bigger patio like they had extended for Cinco de Mayo.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this again after a long time gone. I had the Chicken Bowl, which was more like a salad. Very few beans and chicken and they must have forgotten the rice. So sad. The salsa was like a can of Rotel in a bowl. I know it's a busy spot but ....it's in the details and they had gone missing."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with Mexican. Valle Luna is great! The wait staff was friendly and the food was delicious. You must order the Cheese Crisper if you go!"}
{"text":"I LOVE VALLE LUNA!! One of the best restaurants in the Phoenix area. They are always busy which is a testament to how amazing their food is. I always get good service, especially when Alyssa is working ;) overall, 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Really sad experience. Went to celebrate my hubby's birthday week and use his free dinner entree. I ordered the albondigas soup for dinner as I wasn't super hungry. They served it to me with no albondigas. I told the waitress and she went back to the kitchen and had apparently run out of meatballs but decided to serve it to me anyway. She said it would take 15 minutes to make some more (soup would have been cold by then) and did I want to order something else. I said sure and asked for a menu. Seems like she forgot because she passed by us several times and after about 10 minutes brought the menu. I told her we were almost done and will pass but maybe could discount my soup since it was only celery, carrots and onions. She said she will have the manager come by. Apparently manager had better things to do and waitress says they will take the 4.95 off the bill. Guess I'll make something to eat when I get home instead"}
{"text":"Had dinner on Thursday 8/30/12. Ordered a ground beef chimi and two taco plates. Jennifer, our server, gave us excellent service. Unfortunately the chimi was so so and the tacos were cold. We sent the tacos back and the next orders were warm with the first bite and also cold in the middle. Obviously management doesn't care when someone receives horrible food because no one came by to see if they could do anything or    If we wanted something else. We won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Called in to place a to-go order last Sunday. The girl I spoke with told me they couldn't put veggie fajitas into a bean burrito. Any Mexican restaurant I go to that's what I get and its never been a problem. She told me she'd have to ask and when I told her I would wait she paused for 2 seconds and said they can't do that. She told me I could order a veggie wrap which is just a salad in a spinach tortilla - no thank you! if I wanted that I would have asked for that. I ended up getting what I wanted at Caramba's Fresh Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Love this Mexican spot been frequenting this location for years good service and yummy cheesy enchiladas and I love their chips! Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"What a find! Craving Mexican food I looked up places on Yelp and found Valle Luna. We are fat and happy and buzzed on a Friday night after Happy Hour here! Gigantic portions, awesome prices, and the people working were incredibly friendly and attentive! The trifecta that makes a repeat customer. The atmosphere is slightly dive-y, love it. Quite the mix of characters too, from families to older couples to 20 somethings. Also, I have leftovers. Count me in again and again."}
{"text":"Normally they are great but seemed to be having an off day.  But willing to give them another shot"}
{"text":"Decent southern food. One of those places where the senior citizens flock to because it's not spicy."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here ! Came in on a Sunday , in transition from breakfast to lunch (semi busy) and the service was still great !! Johnny was our server and he is very attentive . He did a great job ! My mom and I shared the Steak Fundido (aaahhhmaaaazing) , and my boyfriend also got a steak enchilada with green sauce. Beans and rice are great ....The chips are super fresh and the salsa was perfect with a squeeze of lemon. Will definitely be coming back , sooner , rather than later !  :) ANDDD not to mention the Sunday Raspberry Margarita ! Yummy stuff !"}
{"text":"This was my neighborhood restaurant.  I've eaten here more than I care to remember.  Their Pollo Fundito is permanently a part of my hips, unfortunately.   I love sitting in their back room near the little waterfall, but the big room is fun too - from watching folks, teenage couples to families managing too many little ones and of course being able to hear the karaoke in the bar.    Their food is Sonoran so don't go looking for anything else.  They have some of the best fajitas in the valley, bar none, even if they do call them \"Carnitas Picante de la Luna\". See Omar's review of another location for proof.   It's my girlfriend's favorite Chicken Chimi in the valley too.  Very \"Phoenix traditional\".  I put that in quotes because you have to know what you want.  This isn't my place to go for Mexico City food.  It's not my place for coastal Mexican food.  But for traditional Phoenix Mexican food it's at the top of the list."}
{"text":"G MOM IS THE BEST SEVER. Always attentive and knows exactly what we want when we come in. She is absolutely wonderful and one of the many reasons we visit!"}
{"text":"Food was so bland and not very tasty. I asked for a hotter salsa and got some weird vegetable mixture."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on the West side, hands down. I usually order the chicken tacos and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Even though this used to be a favorite place of mine to eat when I used to live in the neighborhood, the occasional visit I make here these days often tend to leave me more and more disappointed.  There were a number of issues with my last visit and I send them a message via their website.  The reply I received was the most empty patronizing tripe I've ever read - each issue I raised either wasn't addressed or totally glossed over and no attempt was made to resolve issues regarding the money I was ripped off.  Quite honestly, because the management's attitude was so insulting and uncaring, I can pretty much say that I just don't ever see myself stepping through their doors ever again.  Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in Arizona and there are so many that not only offer far better food and much more a value for the price but actually give a darn about customer satisfaction.  Perhaps if I ever hear that they're under new management I might then give them another chance but otherwise, they blew it big time.  Adios."}
{"text":"We went for the first time on our anniversary, from a recommendation and now have our favorite Mexican cuisine in the valley. Hopefully you get Irene as your server. Best service, food and ambiance. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food you can get in AZ at amazing prices.    This restaurant / cantina  has been at 35th Ave. & Bell Rd. forever and has an amazing following of customers.  I used to take my kids to eat here once a month.    Now, the wife and I just hang-out in the cantina. Same great food and prices but a lot more fun for adults.  The bartenders and servers are all very personable and get to know you by name.  The regulars that go in there make it fun as everyone jokes around and rips on each other.     Great food, prices, people and fun!"}
{"text":"Yummy simple Mexican food, nothing too remarkable.  We only went once and I can't even remember what we ordered just that the food was so-so"}
{"text":"Not much to say about Valle Luna that hasn't been said. In my opinion Valle Luna represents Sonoran-American food as well or better than any other establishment in AZ. This is not \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine per se, but it is the authentic Sonoran food all of us valley natives (gringos and chicanos alike) grew up eating. Always great service and specials to boot.   Get your arses up there, you pinche gabachos!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food on our favorite in town especially this location. Authentic Sonoran Mexican food. Have to try either Mexican pizza."}
{"text":"Casa Noble Silver Margaritas for $6.25, buck more for Reposado, and another dollar for Anejo.  This is not the happy hour price.  Amazing drinks, good prices, wow.  Tortilla chips are thin, served hot & fresh, and accompanied by a salsa and hot sauce.  I had the Sonoran Masa enchiladas (comes with eggs on top) and it was quite good, reasonable portion size, and priced consistent with other casual dining places.  Service was above average.  Cute, casual Mexican place with good drinks.  Hard to beat."}
{"text":"Where are these people with 5 star reviews eating?!?!? Is there a secret door that leads you to a place without complacent, rude servers and dog food quality pork for an exorbitant cost?!?! The only pic I took was of the half empty queso container that cost me $7.25. The green chile pork was seriously dried out like it was boiled and left sitting until some poor sucker orders it and they slip a scoop of salsa on top. The tortilla is completely inedible. The salsa is decent...both hot and mild. There were two different people coming to the register with overcharges on their bill while I was waiting.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Very crowded. Slow service. Got my order wrong, but constant companions right. Nothing stellar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you have any trouble deciding what to eat always pick the fundido. My favorite thing on the menu is the Spinach Enchilada's. This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley and I have lived here for 26 years. I can tell from the recent reviews that they are going through a rough patch but don't let it stop you from trying it out for yourself! Have a couple margarita's, be patient because the place will likely be extremely full and enjoy yourself. :)"}
{"text":"Great food and the employees are very friendly would recommend this place any day..Love the atmosphere at both of these restaraunts, never really had a long wait"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Tuesday, (Senior night) and the combined age of this packed restaurant was over 1 million years! We saw more old folks than Florida did in 2015! Seriously,  that is a testament to the quality of food here. Starting with our waitress; Brittany was charming, and full of smiles. The salsa is close to perfect, and it just keeps coming! Our dishes were served quickly and perfectly to our liking!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. My go-to tasty delight here is the Fundido. I get it every time. The atmosphere is nice. I've been here quite a few times, and always look forward to going back. Service is typically good. The one incident I did have was when glasses were served to us with someone else's lipstick on them. That one kind of grossed me out!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since I have visited here before.   I ordered the taco salad with chicken. When it came out the cheese looked un appetizing, The tortilla bowl they served my guac and sour cream in was already soaking from the chicken juice. The salad was warm and soggy.   I also had to get up to ask for more water after she had stopped by to see how everyone was doing drink wise.   Hopefully this can be improved. I will not be ordering this dish again."}
{"text":"Had a gift card that I was given by a coworker who knew this was one of my favorite places.. Just a bit of context: I've been coming here my entire life since the 80's and always felt like this was a good spot to take out of town guests for great Mexican food.  The quality has dropped off quite a bit but not nearly as bad as the service.  Stopped in with my aunt and asked for a table around 8pm.  I got a parking spot right up front so I assumed that the dinner rush was over.  Was surprised to be told that it would be several minutes for the two of us.  After seeing about 3-4 people sort of standing there a young lady asked me if I had a party of 3. I said oh no it's just the two of us as I had told her about 3 minutes before.  They took us to the back of the restaurant and I was surprised that there were several open booths.  Because we were back by the POS machine I could hear a few of the wait staff complaining about a late rush.  Again they did not seem very busy but if they are understaffed I get it.  We quickly got chips and salsa and I felt bad because it took me a few minutes to decide what I wanted so I just ordered drinks and continued to look at the menu.  I ordered the #1 combo which came with an enchilada, taco, and tamale.  Not too bad for $15.  Food came out in just a few minutes which was great.  We had asked for more chips and salsa but about 10 minutes into our dinner the waitress came over and took our chips away and asked me if I wanted a box.  I was sort of upset because I was not sure I was going to take the taco home.. In fact now I figured maybe she is judging me and assuming that it's too much food to take home.  I actually needed them to split the check but the problem was that we still planned to munch on some chips and order more drinks.  We made the point that we wanted more chips and asked why she had taken them.. She blamed it on the guy who brought us chips which was ridiculous.  Then I felt bad about troubling her to break the bill in half because I had a gift card..  She seemed very frustrated because clearly we were keeping her from getting out of there.  It was not quite 9pm but there were others still dining in the restaurant so I felt like our experience was cheapened because our waitress wanted out.  I would have gotten another margarita and perhaps some fried ice cream.  I understand.. I'm human and sometimes I just want to get out of work but if I'm dealing with a client, customer, or even a work colleague, I don't project my interests on them to suit my needs.  I was very displeased with our waitress as I wish she just would have transferred us to another member of the wait staff rather than rush our dining experience. Also had asked for white enchilada sauce and they just glopped a bunch of cream cheese on my enchilada which was burnt and charged me $2.50 for it.. Probably should have asked to send it back but our waitress was not very interested in having us there so I decided to explain my experience on here. So shame on Valle Luna for making those poor folks work and keeping them from their important lives.  I'm certain if I behaved that way at work, I would not have to worry about the job very long.. Sorry again for coming in and I will make sure that I think twice before coming back here.  I hope I was not too much of an inconvenience for our waitress."}
{"text":"I have been going to Valle Luna since I was a kid. It is one of the few places left in Phoenix that is relatively unchanged.  I always have a good time, great service and good food. And the house margaritas are always plentiful. MMMM, margaritas......."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in 20 years. Place looked just the same. I had the hot wings and my daughter went with the Spinach Enchiladas, a Wednesday night special. Wings were very good and she really like the enchiladas. They also have free chips and salsa.  Happy hour in the Cantina is da bomb."}
{"text":"I Went to this location for the first time yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely loud and a little cramp but not uncomfortable at all. Anyone looking for a quiet restaurant to dine in probably wouldnt like it here but seeing how busy they are makes it okay. Plus it kinda sets the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. However  We sat in the cantina, it was a little small but we were able to grab a high top and had both perfect views of the t.v.   Their happy hour is awesome and the best part is its all day sunday in the cantina! They have good choices  and prices on cocktails and food. The taco baskets are to die for! They are amazing! And a good size! I could eat them all day! Except i only ate two because i was stuffed haha.   Our server was awesome he was super attentive. Being a server I think he did a great job being busy an all. He always got us refills on our drinks, checked up on us, made sure we were happy, and we were! I definitely think I'll be back, especially on sundays and I'll bring a few friends while I'm at it!"}
{"text":"We decided to have this for dinner on a whim last night - and called to place a To-Go order about 30 minutes before they were closing.  We felt a little bad, but hey we were hungry and we didn't want fast food.  There were 3 of us, so we all ordered the same thing - Pollo Fundido.  It came with a side of beans and rice and some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.  We also got a bag of tortilla chips and salsa (spicy and mild).  The guy who answered the phone didn't seem too thrilled to be taking an order before closing.  But when we went there to pick up the food they were actually friendly and gave us extra salsa for our chips without even asking.  That was cool.  We were able to place our order and pick up our food even before the restaurant closed.  The pollo fundido's were absolutely delicious and hit the spot!!  We were mmm'ing and awwww'ing almost every bite.  I would definitely order this dish again and again.  They served a lot of Mexican rice, which I wasn't too excited about, but I'm not a big fan of Mexican rice anyway...but the refried beans were great.  I'm officially a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Saturday, about 4pm. Got here just in time, didn't realize this was the place to be. Had to wait about 10 minuets to be seated. Server was friendly, we ordered. I ordered pollo fundido with beans and rice and a cheese enchilada ala carte. It was all good, nice portions and great taste. Also, ordered a mango margarita frozen, it was delicious. As we were leaving, there were people waiting outside already. It was only 430. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"This was not our first trip to this resturant. They always have some kind of promotional going on which usually keeps the resturant full. Tonight when we arrived we were seated quickly. There were several large groups waiting. The resturant is made up of many rooms all decorated with a mexican theme. We were waited on by Matt. He was attentive and took very good care of us. As with most Mexican Food resturants you start out with chips and salsa. Their salsa is a little more spicy than most. I like it hot so this is fine with myself. They also offer a hotter version.  I had their Chili Verde. I have eaten it several times before and it is one of my favorites.  It comes with rice and beans. There is very good quanity as well as quality. You will not go away hungry. Our dinning experience was pleasent and we went away full. I would definitely recomment Valley Luna."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley, hands down. Excellent happy hour in the cantina after 3.   I was back about a week ago and noticed that Valle Luna has undergone a slight facelift on the restaurant side. It seems like maybe some of the menu pricing has gone up to compensate for the new decor, but not sure about that. Either way, still great food and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and sat in the cantina, chips and salsa were delivered immediately and were delicious. Our server was kind and on top of it. The meal I got seemed a little over cooked but besides that everything was delicious and their happy hour prices were great."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a positive review, because the place is busy enough as it is. But hell, I eat here once a week or more so I can't not say good things.  The long and short of it is come into the bar area during happy hour (which runs till a very convenient 7:30pm, and ALL day on Sundays). The bar food is fantastic and outrageously cheap. I don't know what it is, but these are likely my favorite tacos ever. The drinks are super cheap and great too. $4.50 for a 16oz house margarita? $3 Dos Equis pints? Yes please. They've also got plenty of TVs in the bar so if there is a game you're after you'll likely find it.  Overall, it's a great place. The only thing keeping it from 5-stars is that its always crazy busy, and finding parking is a nightmare (we live close enough so its usually easiest to just walk for us). The crowd as expected can cause some delays in service speed or even worse the ability to get a table at all."}
{"text":"Very good food for the price.  My only disappointment were the Spinach Enchiladas.  The menu said the ingredients included potatoes & zuchinni - but mine were only spinach and cheese.  Tasty, but I would have loved the additional flavors to off set the cheese. Great service, good prices.  I would go again, but would clarify ingredients with my server prior to placing my order."}
{"text":"We frequent this place quite a lot.  Love the machaca beef chimi and the happy hour big beers for $5 - ya just can't beat that!  Family night is great for the kids with $1.99 meals including a drink. The place is always rockin' so we sit in the bar most times that we go but there are a lot of booths that are comfortable.  This is definitely one of our go-to places!"}
