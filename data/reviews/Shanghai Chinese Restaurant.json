{"text":"This restaurant is the only Korean-Chinese restaurant around the North York area so I was excited to have my Thursday dinner. However, the meat thickness of 'sweet and sour pork' is the same as a TOOTHPICK. It's just taste nothing and so greasy. The only thing that I can chew was old-greasy batter. I think they re-fried the old ones. It's better to use 18 dollars as a toilet paper."}
{"text":"Great jajangmyun!!! Noodle in black bean sauce. Nom mom nom!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of jajangmyun (blackbean noodles) and had a seafood jajangmyun here two days ago. It was a big portion and i almost finished all since the sauce was freshly stir fried and was delicious. The server was really kind and made sure i had everything i needed. Im giving four stars since i had better jajangmyun at other resto, but this one is good choice when you are in the area."}
{"text":"I got the veggie black bean noodles, it was pretty good! It was $10.48 with tax. Decent portion and comes with kimchi and pickles. They do take out."}
{"text":"This place still does a solid Jajangmyeon which I always get. They have refreshed their interior a little bit with new paint and signage. They have also opened up where the kitchen used to be as now you can see them cooking.   In terms of seating, the place is still the same and the parking too. Getting parking is problematic.   They have added a few things on their menu like the Donkatsu. It's good but the meat is a little tough. Not as good as Cho Sun Ok or Piggies.   Still recommended for their Jajangmyeon!   #52 of 2018"}
{"text":"Craving Korean, we hit up Yonge and Finch.  He said, let's go to this restaurant that his Korean friend brought him to before, it's good!   I looked at the menu and was instantly confused.  I thought I was going into a Korean restaurant -  all the usual 'signs' pointed to this with the Korean talent show on the TV being the final clincher, besides all the Korean characters on the menu, but I digress - what we went into is actually my first Korean-style Chinese restaurant.  Score!  Though at first a little crestfallen because I was not craving Shanghai, I ordered the black bean noodle that my companion raved about.  To be fair, he didn't know that this restaurant served Korean-style Chinese, because he had only ever ordered this dish, which he identified as very Korean.  It was actually quite tasty and the portions were very generous.  Additionally, we had the sweet and sour pork.  It was the first non-neon orange version that I have ever had and is something that I would recommend.  It came sauteed in a light yellow sauce with black fungus, purple cabbage and carrots - a different and very welcome twist to the regular stuff.  Not too sour, not too sweet, I also found it less gummy and better than the version I'm used to.  The meal also came with a few appetizer dishes like kimchi.  Overall, the food was decent.  It's a bit pricier than regular Chinese restaurants.  For three items, the bill came to over $30 for the two of us.  Washrooms are downstairs and there is limited free parking behind the restaurant which is located in a strip of other stores and eateries.  The restaurant is also accessible from the parking lot in the back via their back entrance."}
{"text":"3.5 rating.  We came here for lunch today and I ordered jajangmyun, and my bf ordered the jambong with tangsooyuk (Korean version of sweet and sour pork) on the side . We were the first customers this afternoon so service was great. I decided to try the tangsooyuk first when it came out and it tasted great just like how I remember it. The jajangmyun tasted good but I still prefer the jajangmyun over at songcook's or sunny dragon. This is a good Korean Chinese style restaurant and if you're in the Yonge finch area, try it out!   My bf said the servers and cooks are Korean Chinese, so you're welcome to order in Mandarin."}
{"text":"Just another day at Korea town. I won't rest until I try every single restaurant over here. By then new ones will open for sure.  This is a \"Korean Chinese\" restaurant. We shared a large order of sweet & sour pork which was tasty. Large portions. Complimentary Kimchi. Quick and friendly service.  Is sweet & sour chicken / pork not authentic enough for ya? Well, cultured Yelpers recommend \"jajangmyun\". Maybe you should try that."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend the other night because we were looking for cheap eats and his mom recommended it. His family being korean said this place had good black bean noodles. I've never had them and I can't say they were WOW but I can see why people crave it and why that dish is a korean comfort food. It was flavourful the noodles were all long none broken. We ordered a combo, sweet and sour pork with black been noodle and noodle in thick seafood sauce. The total after tax and tip was only $32. Which is a steal considering it feed the two of us and with left overs!  The portion sizes were huge (I don't eat a lot in one sitting but my boyfriend does), we managed to walk away with leftover sweet and sour pork and some noodles.   The decor is kinda small and not special. The washroom was kinda hard to find I walked into the kitchen at first thinking it was the back but really it was downstairs and I just missed the stairs in total-Whoops.  The stairs going down are kinda narrow so be careful.   All in all if I were craving cheap Korean food and wanted a break from Pork Bone soup I would come back."}
{"text":"It's a tiny restaurant but I do enjoy the food there!! Love all the noodles there and the chicken and pork(I forgot their names) were soooooooo good, although I don't know why is called shanghai Chinese restaurant with serving Korean food."}
{"text":"After eating a food, i got a stomachache... I recommend other Korean chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I should of read the sign through. I wanted Korea food turns out it was Korea and Chinese restaurant. Well i decided to give it a shot.  Ordered seafood noodle soup with seafood and omelette with Fried rce.  Seafood noodle was bland with only 3 tiny muscles and couple of pieces of frozen shrimps  omelette fried was over powered with ketchup and it was not a omelette just a really thin egg layover bed of rice with ketchup and then more ketchup on top of the egg. Also, shredded lettuce and drizzle ketchup is not a proper garnish.  We should have took a hint when the last customers at the other table left with all their dishes still full of food.  Customer service was the only thing was okay."}
{"text":"What is missed in 100% perfection, is made up by a wonderful dining experience, with kind, polite and attentive wait staff and owner.  Good chungsik (Korean-style Chinese food) is difficult to find in Toronto.    I had the cham-pong, (my all time favourite) which is a spicy noodle soup, with cut/carefully scored squid, tons of onions, ear mushroom and a mussel or two.  I asked for extra garlic which they provided.  Spouse had the jajangmyeon which he said was tasty, ok, no kamja or pork in it, but peas.  Not exceptional, but ok.  The prices here are very reasonable, the portion sizes are reasonable.  It is a nice place, but just slightly misses the mark of being a four star.  Five stars for the quality baechu kimchi."}
{"text":"Decent place for Korean style Chinese food if you don't have a car. Not the best but acceptable if you crave Korean Chinese food in Yonge and Finch area"}
{"text":"Little did I know that I would be served with a bowl containing chopped raw onions and cucumbers in stir-fried black bean sauce, and another bowl containing sticky noodles. Those were not what I was expecting when I got gan jjajang (black bean noodles), a staple of Korean Chinese (Chinese Korean) cuisine. Little did I know that I would be feeling dizzy and sweaty and suffering from food poisoning the next morning. To sum it up, I have never had such a bad bowl of jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) anywhere.   We ordered gan jjajang, and they brought out, as described, one bowl with noodles in it and another bowl with the chopped raw onions and cucumbers in stir-fried black bean sauce. I have never seen gan jjajang filled with so much raw onions and cucumbers! Gan jjajang doesn't really contain raw onions and cucumbers if done properly, so I found it very weird to get this bowl filled with raw onions and I don't eat raw onions! I have had my share of Korean Chinese (Chinese Korean) food and trust me I have never seen jjajangmyun cooked like this. Both of us, Koreans found this dish bad. So much raw onions and cucumbers, no beef, sticky noodles, wow this was the worst black bean noodles ever! I still ate just some of the noodles and cucumbers; then left it largely uneaten. The worst part is I got food poisoning and is recovering from it the next morning. This was such a disappointing visit because the black bean noodles my s.o had here few months ago was done very well. Service was good but with this kind of black bean noodles, I won't be returning and I cannot give this place anything more than a one star rating. Where is the option for a zero star rating?"}
{"text":"Although the name of this restaurant sounds like a Chinese restaurant, it's actually a Korean restaurant that specializes in jajangmyun (black bean noodles).    I ordered the combo A with my friend. It has one jajangmyun, spicy seafood noodles soup and the sweat&sour pork. You can also make request to change the noodles to others that within the same price range.   I give them only four star because I'm not really a fan of noodles. But the overall service and food quality is good."}
{"text":"Love the jajangmyun and tangsuyuk combo here Very large portion sizes for cheap prices"}
{"text":"Trying for the first time . The service was ok nothing special . The food wasn't that great . No verity in their menu ,very limited selection ."}
{"text":"I ordered the jajangmyeon with beef, and I have to say that it was the jajangmyeon that I've ever had anywhere! Well, I've only tried it at 3 other restaurants but still. It was delicious and very cheap. My girlfriend ordered the bamboo shoots with beef and shrimp on steamed rice, which was good, but nowhere near as good as the jajangmyeon though. We also ordered some stir fried bell pepper and beef dish, which was just okay and pretty expensive to boot considering what you get. The kim chi complimentary side dish was awesome too! The inside of the restaurant is a little bare bones, but nothing horrifying. Service was adequate."}
