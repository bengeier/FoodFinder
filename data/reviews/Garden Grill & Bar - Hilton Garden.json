{"text":"We had the pleasure of finding this great restaurant at the hotel.  It was not too crowded being Dec 23.  

Our server Christene was awesome she was friendly and made some excellent suggestions and very attentive. The menu is not large but even with a smaller selection all options sounded excellent from burgers, pork chops with a bourbon glaze to steak.  We started with the flat bread pizza it was very good.  They are very flexible with sides with multiple options.  The homemade kettle chips are crispy with great seasoning.  

The chef Charlie came out to say hello and thank us for our compliments.  

We will definitely be back.  Very convenient being local.  The prices were reasonable.  Thank you Christene and Charlie for making our visit so nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I highly recommend it as a hotel or just to stop in and eat. I am a raging alcoholic and the bartender Christene (why does she spell it with an \"e\"???) was on the spot. I never had to wait for a drink. After consuming a metric crap ton of liquor I got hungry and ordered wings, a turkey club sandwich, fries and kettle chips. They were all great. The chief came out and asked how it was- I mumbled with my mouthful of Hilton cuisine f**ing amazing. He smiled and thanked me. A true professional. Christene (why the \"e\"- English has rules!??) was very friendly and while cutting me off from consuming anymore alcohol didn't call the authorities on me. I am forever grateful. EAT & DRINK HERE!"}
{"text":"This is a very good; casual restaurant you can add to your \"Go To\" list. Pretty typical hotel dining. Nothing fancy but very good service and very well done presentation and quality meals. Sit at the bar or grab a comfortable table, this is hotel casual. This being said The Garden offers a good value & good food."}
{"text":"Since it was a weeknight and I had put no forethought into what we'd have for dinner, I hunted through my Groupons to see where we could go.  The Hilton Garden Inn was close to home,  so we took our $30 voucher and headed off to the Garden Grille and Bar. Once we entered the hotel, I saw no sign that identified the 20 seat area by the bar as the Garden Grille, but the bartender (who doubled as our waitress) said we were in the right place. The seating area is devoid of any decor and this blah beige alcove looks like what it is probably most used for--seating for hotel guest's continental breakfasts. At 6pm on a Wed. night, there was a conference ending in the hotel, but we were the only ones in the dining area (3 others were in the bar area) and it was just plain weird feeling. My husband and I both ordered the Mobley Burger. Our server informed me that the burger came with fries, which were definitely not on my diet, but I decided I would eat some anyway so not to hurt the chef's feelings (lol). The hamburger arrived on a  fresh ciabatta-type roll, nicely presented with a  mound of fries. The burger was quite good (w/ tomato, lettuce and onion), and cooked medium rare exactly as requested. I hate half of it before I succumbed to the French Fries. They were barely lukewarm. My assumption was that they had cooled while I was devouring my burger. In one sense this was good because I shouldn't have been eating them anyway and this made them not so enticing after all.  When later quizzing my husband on his opinion of the Grille, he mentioned that his were cold but he just ate them anyway. Two decent burgers with cold fries and two iced teas served in a restaurant (?) with no atmosphere came to $32. Had I been paying full price I would have been more disappointed."}
