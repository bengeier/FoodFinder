{"text":"This place is not consistent with their food., our first time there our fish was really good.. we ordered lunch fish .
Second time we order dinner $$$ waist of money!!! Our fish was horrible!!! Burnt !!!! We put our dinners in the trash!!"}
{"text":"Really great catfish. This is a new place to order and do takeout. They do catfish, wings, poboys. The catfish was nice and tasty. I'm excited to try their chicken wings and poboy sandwiches. Come early as they get busy during lunch. The sides are really good too. Fried okra is tender and crisp.

They also have a daily selection of pies and puddings."}
{"text":"Let's be real here. This place really gives fish frying a bad rap. First time I stopped by the owner was inside kicking back but the place was closed. No menus no nothing. Then I tried again. They were open but were out of a lot of menu items. I saw them defrosting the frozen fish. I am all about supporting my brothers and sisters so I ordered anyway. Got the fish home and it tasted like fish water. I can't stand fishy tasting fish...not fresh at all. This place receives a big . Don't do it!!!!"}
{"text":"We drove by a few times thinking it was closed, but finally stopped and boy! My partner had fish holla and I had the catfish nuggets. The owner gave us a bit of something not on the menu.... everything was beyond expectations. Exceptional customer service and whoever is in this kitchen is experienced and knows seasoning and flavor. Definitely my first food WOW moment in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not like the others . That says it ,& it's not & ends up being Swai  . Not here , your getting the real deal catfish like it's supposed"}
{"text":"Best fried fish I've had outside of my Mommy and Grandmas house. Friendly and personable staff made it even better!"}
{"text":"Had a shrimp po boy with fried okra. It was awesome. It's a generous portion of shrimp for the price."}
{"text":"If you have the time to enjoy a quality filled dish then this is the place, WE are always ever so ready to offer you the Fish Cage experience and while there be sure to ask about the \"Garlic Parmesan Catfish\".
Catfish, Red Snapper and Whiting are menu items daily along with Shrimp, Oysters and Chicken
\"WE specialize in the foods WE all love to eat\""}
{"text":"Ordered several things to get a feel for the food that they serve ...first up was a shrimp Po boy well they didn't have buns so they served it on a hamburger bun! they were overcooked and the french fries and all three orders were soggy increasing they use quick OK so you expect Crisp on the outside soft on the inside... the wings soggy not crispy... won't go back! Oh how do you have a fish place and not do onion rings!? Sorry the corn meal crusted fish was ok"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Fish Cage and I ordered the shrimp. They were good and plentiful but could have used just a little more seasonings. The potato salad was good, but a little too much mustard for my taste. My problem with this place was the menu and the cashier.  The menu says the dinner comes with a drink, so imagine how  surprised I was when the rude cashier said it doesn't come with a drink. The menu says, \"drink included.\" ''It's wrong do you want a card?'' Lol! That's what I got from the rude cashier. I mean how hard is it to change an electronic sign or better yet tell me upon ordering, ''by the way the menu is incorrect, the dinners do not come with a drink.'' I'll probably go back maybe by then the menu will be fixed and the customer service will be better."}
{"text":"This is by far the Best catfish that I've ever had. It was fried perfectly and the seasoning was just right. The pieces were large and the meat nice and flaky! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some great tasting food. Order two catfish nugget and fries lunch  meals and a side of shrimp. The food was very plentiful and the shrimp were huge! And the kool aid, the kool aid was bomb! I will be definitely recommending this spot to my EVERYONE!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to pick up a great oyster po-boy! The oysters are always delicious and a great size. Also I enjoy their options of kool aid. Oh yes and if they have it available make sure you pick up some bannana pudding.. It's Fire"}
{"text":"Waited for this place to open.  Finally after driving by for weeks it opened.
What a disappointing opening.  Ordered Catfish and wings, you figure no one can 
F*** up Catfish and wings.  Fish was burnt and sliver of a filet.  Wings were hard
and dry, not work the $18.00 I spent.  Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The crab ball was super amazing though! The size of the crab ball is pretty fair even though the flavors make you want more. 
I ordered to go which was ready in about 15 minutes. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Fish cage is FIRE best fish fry in town! You can smell it outside the door. Real seafood and great service"}
{"text":"One thing about this place  that...IT IS CLEAN!!
Been hearing about this joint, Not Too Bad.
The fish was tasteful! Well at least they didn't have deep fried cockroaches cooked in with the fish, So"}
{"text":"Love the crab balls & the sauce ! Love the shrimp ! The catfish was good also but the crab balls stole the show"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews ... but the Po Boys at this location are legit.. Been leaving in LV for almost 10 years and I had a tough time finding a place that sells good Po Boys \"until today of course\".. I ordered the Fried Oysters and it was outstanding the potions are so big that 2 people can share the same sandwich... the comes with a lot of fries so be ready. Recommendation.. order by phone a pick up the food to go."}
{"text":"Service 3.5
Food 3.5
Cleanliness 4
Price for take out $$$.$
The food was good
The sides were not fabulous 
The catfish was delish 
It's cooked to order
The oacra was delish"}
{"text":"If you like seafood then you like fishcage and if your big on customer care, fishcage is your place of service 
The crab balls and shrimp are a hot commodity, the Red snapper is slapping and I advise you to try the sampler"}
{"text":"As a newbie from Oakland, I was looking for a place that had catfish and my favorite fried okra! They give you generous pieces of fish and the okra and collards are delish!!! I'll definitely make this one of my favs! Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you don't feel like frying fish at home...here's an option  


Nothing great...nothing bad 

Fried fish done well."}
{"text":"Food was great the crab balls are a must. Not often that I get shrimp that is not over cooked. The fish was crunchy and fresh also gave a good portion of food. I will definitely be back I didn't get to try the cake or pudding this go around. Can definitely tell the difference between the real catfish and the swai  others are selling. Keep up the good work and you will keep a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Easily the best seasoned catfish I've had outside of homemade. I usually get the 7 Dolla Holla meal, sometimes adding an extra piece of catfish and a soda for about $10 total. Great option for takeout! Every time I've been here I get friendly and prompt service. Suggested it to a coworker and he agreed the fish was perfect! So excited to try the poboy next"}
{"text":"The food was very good  (catfish dinner)  I had it delivered,  it was still hot and crispy.  The delivery guy Theo from Go get it live was very nice.   
I'll definitely order again"}
{"text":"Front counter staff is deplorable , it's one thing to be tired it's another thing to tell patrons that you are tired. Now the food. I never can understand why \"certain\" establishments don't use a food distributors that monitor their food levels to ensure they have enough  food to service it's patrons. Why the hell would I order a shrimp poboy pay for it and then you tell me you out of shrimp do you just go substitute the shrimp for oysters..... I'll wait times up. Then you give me one slice of bread and one half container less than an ounce of hot sauce for a seafood platter. The food was decent but the cook got a stank ass attitude when the lady at the counter takes an order to the back you get a glimpse of him from behind the dirty dusty shower curtain that separates the front of the house from the back of the house.... do better folks......"}
{"text":"Chef G is an amazing chef.  His fried cat fish is to die for, and don't get me started on the crab balls.  I felt like I was eating at a gourmet restaurant.  I especially love the Parmesan Cheese Fried Cat Fish, it sent my taste buds into over drive.  They are a clean establishment and I am looking forward to bringing my family home some.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nope! I am a Cali girl, and a good fish spot is something I crave. This is not it! I spent about $50 on 3 dinners (2 snappers and a catfish)......it was a waste of money. The snapper was skinny strips fried to the point of jerky, while the catfish was much bigger and not quit as jerky like. The sides were terrible, store bought macaroni and potato salad....yuck!"}
{"text":"Ordered the catfish nuggets, fries and a side of Mac n cheese. The fish was wonderful. The mac n cheese for the price should be a bigger portion.

I will return for the fish and avoid the sides."}
{"text":"I ordered red snapper dinner. The fish was a little too fishy tasting for my preference. The fried okra delicious, banana pudding also very good."}
{"text":"Went into this establishment thinking I'm sure they won't have any fish that I can eat, but low and behold not only did they have something but they had whiting fish which made my stomach very happy."}
