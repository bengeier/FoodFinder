{"text":"Fantastic! We were a party of 8 and this place was perfect! Ordered the seafood raviolis; fantastic large portion! Table also ordered the Barramundi special; also fantastic and Delish! Fish was cooked to perfection! Good attentive service and lovey atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"NOT GOOD and certainly not even worth ONE STAR except for the physical ambiance and quiet atmosphere based on not many patrons dining while there.  WOW, what an evening from start to finish. Certainly not deserving of a \"Prima\" spot in Gainey Ranch.  The staff are uninformed of the menu, and definitely not polished to serve the type of clientele that come here. They seem to be staffed from a fast food chain,  not one is professional or knows the food or their particular job. Adding to every other comment thus far, the owner Gino does have a very long way to go to comprehend the full essence of a fine dining experience. He was confrontational and actually childish with not only our table, but the two tables surrounding us regarding bad drinks, spoiled wine, and not honoring offers prior to reservations for discounts and birthdays.  The food has little to offer as far as being  true \"Italian\" food.  It is an adventure to talk about for years but to never experience again.  Don't waste your time or money. Pricey for generic \"Italian food\". No VALUE in the experience at all, except for the time with special friends."}
{"text":"This was, by far, the worst dinner we have had in a very long time. This was a special Holiday dinner for my Mother and we were very disappointed. The restaurant was mostly empty, and we quickly found out why they need to offer a Groupon. The food was cold and bland. It was clearly not prepared fresh. The bread was covered with a wet slimy onion topping that was obviously added to pre-purchased bread and slightly warmed. There was no other bread option. We asked for coffee and was told they only had decaf. Very disappointing Holiday dinner."}
{"text":"Four of us were looking forward to trying this restaurant  our waiter was less than enthusiastic and it reflected in his service      Two orders of clam linguini were not eatable   Fishy   Sent back was not charged      Unfortunately will not go back"}
{"text":"I went here this past week and had a ridiculous experience. The food was fine, nothing to write home about but nothing bad, and the service was fine as well. However, I ordered the pasta special (which was grilled chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes, and garlic). I was shocked when the bill came and that dish was $28! It was the pasta special, but I didn't even think to ask the price given the ingredients. I asked to speak to the owner about it (because the steak was $28 and everything else was less) and he told me that somewhere somehow they have to make money so it's on the pasta special because all of the other dishes are a huge bargain, so next time come back and get another dish so we can really be getting value for our money. Is he for real? This is not how you run a restaurant. $28 for pasta with chicken, never, and it wasn't even that good. But mostly it was how poorly the owner handled it."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a reservation to eat here. When we dined here the experience while eating was great. We got the shrimp artichoke mushroom in the cream sauce. Well on the way home both my wife and got sick. I got really sick a couple hours later, the vomiting kind. Well I called the next day to get some compensation for vomiting up my $70 meal. The manager Juan said that it was not the food and if it was did I go to the hospital and receive a docs note. Keep in mind I understand that getting sea food you take a risk. I am from Southern Louisiana.  And then continued to be defensive even though I said it was a good experience. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I can be very particular about quality and service. With that said, I don't think that the one and two star reviews are very fair to La Prima Donna.  The cuisine is very good. I lived in Italy for a short time, and I can honestly say that it is very authentic. At one point I told my friend that it felt like I was back in Italy. The food has a very fresh and light flavor throughout all of the dishes. This to me is a sign of artful cooking. I ordered the linguini quattro formaggio with chicken and a glass of Chardonnay. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the cheeses had just enough zing to it.  The chardonnay was a great choice and had the perfect lightness to accompany the dish.   My favorite part of the meal was the dessert. If you go to La Prima Donna you MUST order the tiramisu. It was to die for good. My friend had the cannoli which was delicious as well.   In regards to service, I felt that it met my expectations. The staff was very attentive, remembered my name, and anticipated the needs at the table. Yes, a negative experience with a server can tarnish the evening. Sometimes there are a variety of reasons, and it's hard to tell the quality of service with only one visit.   Another bit of advice... this is a great place to go for a romantic evening. The restaurant has these amazing sky lights, a fireplace in the back, candle light, and a fountain. It felt very intimate and comfortable."}
{"text":"We use Groupons to discover new restaurants. This was one of them.  I paid $40 for a $80 meal (supposed dinner for 4)  including drinks and two orders of bruschetta.  Firstly, we did not receive any bruschetta, nor drinks, and our server did not credit us for $80 worth of food from the final check.  We ended up paying $120 extra for 3 people as the server simply deducted $40, not $80 as it should have been.  Folks, this is false advertising and dishonest.  The Groupon was not honored. Secondly, the food was mediocre as was the service.  The average dish price was $28.00.  This would have been satisfactory had the quality of food matched the relatively high price.  This establishment was quite a disappointment on multiple levels.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went in with a valid Groupon for lunch.  Server informed us that the last group had a Groupon and they left because they would not honor the Groupon.  We told him we had a Groupon and he said it is only good after 4pm.  The Groupon does not specify this.  We left a completely empty restaurant and went to one of the 20 other restaurants within one mile of La Prima.  We were the only customers.   Thank goodness Groupon will refund and La Prima will not benefit.  There are too many other restaurants in the area to deal with such picayune aggravation.    The condescending attitude of the server is what really turned me off.    We wanted to try a new place.  Scratch this one.  Guess we will have to try one of the other 50 restaurants within a 3 mile radius of this establishment."}
{"text":"Being  former regular patrons of Un Bacio we were anxious to check out its replacement.  I am rating this based on my first experience; saying that, I really don't know if we'll be back.  My margarita was awful.....they must not have mix and instead squeezed a lime and poured tequila over it with a spritzer...bitter/awful.  Clams Casino very good.  Bruchetta...since when is bruchetta so spicy that you cannot tolerate it??  It was more like pica de gallo.  Additionally, I bit down on something rubbery in the bruchetta and it turned out to be the rubber top for the balsamic vinegar they use.   Now, you would THINK the owner would, at the very least, remove the bruchetta from our bill...nope..instead he brought over the bottle of vinegar to prove what happened!  Are you kidding me?  Does that make it right?  He wanted us to have a tiramisu instead but we said that we did not have time and had to move onto an appt.....we paid for the debacle..he did not offer a credit for a future visit or remove the appetizer from our bill.  Not the best way to handle this during your opening."}
{"text":"A server can really ruin your evening - and that is exactly what happened to us last night at La Prima Donna.  Beyond that, food was less than fair.  We had never seen veal pounded so thin.  My husband was still hungry when we left.  I asked to substitute a vegetable for the pasta.  Server said 'spinach' would be $6, as a substitute!  Don't waste your money or your evening."}
{"text":"My husband had a gig there. He got paid by a check but was no good when he took it to the bank, Can't find anything on the Noopi Corporation and the owner of this establishment."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant!  My girlfriend and I were having our monthly date night and could not have ended up at a better spot..  Just by happen chance we ended up on the wrong street and saw this gem of a restaurant tucked in the back of the parking lot.  The decor and ambiance were serene right as you walk in.  The bar has an incredible display of alcohol and the dining room was perfectly separated to give you a dual experience.  I ordered the veal marsala which melted in my mouth.  My girlfriend had the fettuccini quatro formaggio with shrimp which was just as good (she got mad at me for helping myself a little too much to her entree)  Juan paired our meals with the perfect wines and really gave us a great experience.  I was so taken aback by the meal I asked to meet the owner and offer my gratitude.  Gino was a very appreciative gentleman and even gave us a complimentary port to finish off our meal.  They earned my patronage without a doubt.  If it wasn't for that little detour and our willingness to take a chance we would have truly missed out on an incredible experience.  Thanks again Juan and Gino you both made our night!  We will be seeing you many more times in the future.   OOOOooooo ALSO while speaking with Gino I asked where he shops for his ingredients because the food was so refreshing and good.  He told me the food is all ORGANIC!  Truly impressed with your restaurant.  Ill be sure to get some good pictures next time I go and update my review."}
{"text":"Went today.  Had a great lunch, waiter was awesome (Johnny) and the food was delicious.   Very nice décor inside.  We had chicken marsala, chicken parmesan.  The bread was fantastic too (freshly baked).  I cant stand corporate chain restaurants who skimp on their portions, this place is the opposite.  I highly recommend this place! Thank you we will be back!"}
{"text":"Just made a reservation for the 3rd trip for dinner. Haven't been disappointed yet. Food is well prepared; service is quick and efficient; ambiance....well what can I say.  J.F."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant hoping for a great meal. It was lsted on our Passport Card and were told they no longer take it but would do something for us. The owner wouldn't commit to what he was going to do. The restaurant was empty. Now I know why. We left. Can an empty restaurant really afford to lose four new customers?"}
{"text":"My wife and I were invited by another couple. She was worried because of the other reviews (she always checks yelp before we go out). The restaurant was busy and had a nice ambience. The staff was very friendly. Everyone at our table was happy with their dishes. Basic, good Italian food. My chicken was cooked properly and the food all came out together. For dessert, they cooked the bananas Foster at the table nicely. The owner came to our table at the end of the meal to thank us and gave us each a boxed Italian cake and a small glass of dessert wine as Christmas gift.   Seems they got their act together since opening. Nice neighborhood Italian eatery. We would go back."}
{"text":"Don't bother. This place was done before it even got started. Mediocre food, unattentive service and clueless owner = recipe for disaster."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. There were people at the bar, but we were the only ones at a table for a while. Seemed that the cook was the only one working, he yelled to sit anywhere. You could tell he was running around trying to do everything. I told him we had a Groupon and we didn't get offered any specials that others that came in after us did. Took quite some time for him to take our order.  Sometime into the meal, someone arrived to help him, but never acknowledged us. I ordered spaghetti with marinara $16 and a side of meatballs $6. I ate the meatballs which were very bland, but piled tons of parmesan cheese on them to add flavor but the marinara was the worst I have ever tasted. I love marinara but hate the taste of tomato and it tasted like raw tomato. My husband ordered prime rib with some peppercorn mustard sauce$30 with a side of veggies, which the only choice was green beans. The sauce tasted like mustard that didn't belong on a piece of good meat. There was a great smear of balsamic glaze on the plate that tasted fantastic...it was the only thing that did. The green beans were ok, but had some glaze of sorts on it that tasted kind of like capers. My husband gagged when he took a bite that had more glaze on it and then couldn't eat any more. The bread was ok, but cold. I finally had to flag down the guy who was ignoring us for the check. We were never asked if we needed anything else or how the meal was. I don't like giving bad reviews but this place deserves it. I would highly recommend NOT going here. Go anywhere else. The bill came to $58.xx but after the Groupon it was $18.xx. we didn't order anything but the food I listed. I always tip well, but this time I left a total of $20. Period. But that was because I wasn't going to wait for the $1.xx change, I just left it as a tip."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a couple in our group, ten of us descended upon this gem of an Italian restaurant last night.  What a great experience!  It's exterior is unprepossessing, though efforts have been to make it stand out from it's more commercial neighbors with huge pots of colorful flowers and a cleanly swept entry, but pass over the threshold and you have entered a casually elegant restaurant that hints at it's European roots without hitting you over the head with checkered tablecloths and wax-dribbled chianti bottles.    We met up in the bar, which is very handsome with shimmering bottles up-lit behind the bar and lots of comfy seating---both stools and high-tops.  The bartender was warm and courteous.  After collecting our starter beverages (DH had the house cab and I the house pinot---both very good!), we were led back to our very own private dining room where we could talk and laugh as loudly as we'd like without disturbing the other diners.   A long, narrow-ish room, there were windows on either side---to one side, looking out on the landscaping and the other into the dining room, so we didn't feel isolated at all---just special!  It was a wee bit chilly so a gas fire was dancing on the hearth at one end while a fountain burbled on the other---the feng shui rocked!  Other reviewers have complained about the service---what are they talking about?  Johnny, our server, was fantastic.  Lots of personality, professional, knew the menu, and showed admirable patience because couples had \"mixed\" so he had to track who went on which ticket, a task he accomplished with aplomb.  DH and I shared a Capreze salad.  Now a Capreze salad is pretty basic---tomato, mozzarella, basil, dribbled with balsamic vinegar.  But all the ingredients were very fresh and bursting with flavor and the presentation was beautiful.  I ordered the special---a MASSIVE veal chop layered with a slice of eggplant and then laid over with a blanket of melt-y, gooe-y cheese.  It was supposed to have marinara served on it but I asked for the red sauce on the side because I am not a huge tomato sauce fan and I like to be in control of it.  To accompany, I had the choice of veggies or pasta.  I chose the veggies.  The chop was perfectly cooked, so moist and toothsome with the perfect amount of crisp breading.  The marinara sauce---am I really saying this?---was really good!  Not too sweet, not too tangy, nicely seasoned and the perfect texture.  The veggies were cooked to the point they were tender with such a hint of bite----the plate was dominated by carrots and I might have liked a bit more broccoli, but that's a minor quibble.  I ate and ate and ate and still had a healthy portion to bring home.  DH got the Chicken Parmesan.  That's his go-to dish for judging an Italian restaurant.  (Sort of like chiles rellenos are mine for Mexican!)   He said it reminded him of the Chicken Parm he enjoyed several times at a favorite restaurant on the Amalfi Coast when we visited Italy----need I say more?  DH was very, very pleased with his meal.  He, needless to say, had no leftovers to bring home!    The other eight members of our party ordered a variety of dishes---one ordered the Chicken Martini, La Prima's signature dish, and DH says he'll get that next time.  Another had a Veal Marsala that looked so delicious I almost---almost!---regretted my chop for, it looked so good.  Another ordered the Ciopinno, bursting with mussels, shrimp, salmon, clams....  Everyone had something different.  As DH said, we were cheerful, noisy group until the plates were delivered and then the table fell nearly silent except for moans of appreciation as everyone enjoyed their meals.  Johnny offered a wonderful dessert menu, but we were all replete, so the ten of us all finished our meals with cappuccino that was accompanied by a lovely biscotti cookie, and the owner of La Prima Donna was thoughtful enough to offer to us all glasses of port to partner with our coffees.  Did I mention that the owner/chef---I believe his name is Gino---stopped by our table?  You can see his passion and love for what he is doing in word and action.  The couple who suggested La Prima Donna said that he has been chef in some of the finest restaurants in Phoenix before opening the doors of La Prima Donna.  All-in-all, a very good dining experience and one DH and I look forward to repeating soon.  Thank you Johnny and Gino and all our friends for a really enjoyable evening!  I happily recommend La Prima Donna to all my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Food is OK. Wine selection OK. They don't serve beer -- how weird is that?  They have a little wood dance floor with OK live music. It's mostly R&B by a one man band that sings.  Prices are high.  Last time my girlfriend and I went there was on a Saturday it wasn't busy. We sat for 15 minutes without getting service. We left. That was Badda Donna!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we found this place.  Tucked away in Gainey Ranch, there's no way we'd have found this otherwise.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:  Caprese Salad, $8 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-prima-donna-scottsdale?select=37Yvp0BBbIpyWLb-jfZB8A#37Yvp0BBbIpyWLb-jfZB8A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-prima-donna-scottsdale?select=dYC0JZdxcLqwTYQD-agXpA#dYC0JZdxcLqwTYQD-agXpA  Spaghetti Marinara, $16 + 3 Meatballs $5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-prima-donna-scottsdale?select=ysNPH5HmyXpVW55mU_7J-Q#ysNPH5HmyXpVW55mU_7J-Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-prima-donna-scottsdale?select=gePXdjYraRbBtm3MYkvTBA#gePXdjYraRbBtm3MYkvTBA  Fettuccine Quattro Formaggio, $18 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-prima-donna-scottsdale?select=wQR20SctyY6lurR3THn4kg#wQR20SctyY6lurR3THn4kg  Chianti, $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-prima-donna-scottsdale?select=UyYvYdfPqUptPf1ac-iGmA#UyYvYdfPqUptPf1ac-iGmA  I love Caprese Salad and they do it well here.  It's a hearty serving, so be sure to share otherwise you could be blowing your appetite with this appetizer alone.  The Pasta dishes were very good, but I thought there was too much Sauce and it overwhelmed the dish.  As you can see in the photos, it was pretty Sauce-y.  Good flavor though.  The Meatballs were excellent.  Average price for a glass of Wine @ $10 per for Chianti.    The service was so/so.  Our waiter wasn't very attentive....had to flag him down for refills on Wine & Water.  He was nice though.  Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!! Got a groupon so we decided to give it a try. The menu on-line looked great. What was on the menu when we got there was totally different than the one on-line. $16.00 for a Caesar Salad made table side, was NOT made table side and was tiny. We weere told they were out of all the beef, steaks and veal chops that were on the menu. They also ran out of their specialty bread. We had to ask for butter 5 times. We had 1 veal marsala and one veal piccata that each came with a side of pasta. My husband's pasta was ice cold. I asked for the vodka sauce which was an extra charge, fine but not for almost as much as a full order of penne a la vodka. That isn't right. There was one table of 4 occupied when we came in, then two or three more tables of 2 came in while we were there. We were not offered the lamb that the other tables were offered. We waited 50 minutes to get our food.  My husband just realized that they wanted to see the groupon before we ordered to show the owner to get the okay. We can only assume that is why we were told that the steak and veal chops were not available when other people got them. As it was, our bill was over $41.00 before tip, but after the groupon. Without the groupon the bill was $80.00. Alot for 2 people who had salad and veal scallopine. NO liquor. I don't mind paying for good food and good service, but this certainly was neither."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and give 5 stars for taking the restaurant at face value. The food was very good, service was very good. The ambiance was very good. I had a restaurant.com gift certificate. I had wanted to use the whole 50 on it but apparently I would have had to spend 100 for that to happen.  That's hit against Restaurant.com not this restaurant.  We went to eat at 8:15 on a Saturday night and we were without exaggeration, the only people there. Odd. Very odd. But I'm not going to judge. It is a bit pricey but again, you get a lot if food. They have a lot of specials. Good wine list for those who are into that.  All in all it is a good Italian restaurant but not an everyday place to eat. I almost forgot to add that they offer a 10% discount on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I had bought a Groupon for La Prima Donna.  The restrictions were that you had to go Mon - Thurs so we went last night (Thursday).  The place was decorated quaintly.  The bar had a few people in it for the TNF game and there were two other parties besides my husband and I in the place.  Our waiter was attentive and very funny.  The cook even came out and said (in a very thick Italian accent) he wasn't happy with the first batch of risotto that he made so he's going to make another fresh batch for me.  The food took a while but we already expected that.   Husband had the meat lasagna and I had the seafood risotto.  We also tried the fettuccine alfredo.  The portions were huge.  The food was very good.  Very impressed with the attentiveness we received.  It's a ways from our home so we won't be able to be regulars but if we are in the area and want Italian we will stop in."}
{"text":"We used a second Groupon for last night's visit to La Prima Donna. We ask to sit at a high top table in the bar so we could enjoy the music. Jimmy Snowden sings on Friday and Saturday nights and he was terrific. The bartender did not rush us and we throughly enjoyed sipping wine and listening to Jimmy worked his way musically through the 40's to the 70's. We ordered pasta this time and enjoyed the evening very much."}
{"text":"Tried this place alone and ate at the bar. Very nice place and great Italian food. When I checked in Yelp got me 10 percent off !! Looking forward to going back for another lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this week, LOVED IT.  Ambiance- they manage to hit the right balance between high end dining and a warm, welcoming experience- smelled amazing as I walked through the door. Super friendly owners and staff, made me feel welcome even though I was dining by myself after work- didn't feel like hitting rush hour so I thought I'd try someplace new before heading home.   They brought out some yum crusty bread to start with, and I got a salad, glad that I trusted the waiter and went with the house vinaigrette, it was just the right balance of flavors.  I would highly recommend the ricotta and spinach dumplings that I ordered as my main dish- they came in a pink sauce that I seriously just wanted to drink with a straw, it was that good.  The sauce was definitely made in house as well, wish I had that recipe... I will be back with my family and friends next time, it's a keeper!"}
{"text":"There is something to be said about properly prepared Italian food.  Having been to Italy recently, I now taste the difference between American Italian, and the real stuff you'd find in Tuscany. I'm just a big fan of entrees prepared table side.  I had the Steak Dianne, and it was the perfect balance of medium rare steak and a very flavorful mushroom cream sauce.  Me and my co worker split that portion and also had an order of the calamari!   Really really fresh.  Finally, we ordered the Tiramisu with a glass of port.  It reminded me of Sinatra's at the Encore!  Served in a martini glass and just perfect.  I really don't see how these other people had so bad of a time.  I came on a Wednesday night, and the service and atmosphere was great.  Scottsdale keeps surprising me with the number of great dining spots here.  I may just turn in my aloha shirts and make my way to the desert!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend came here first for happy hour in the bar and then met up with a large group later for dinner. I'm not sure exactly how to rate this place actually there were highs and lows throughout. HH was a bit disappointing as the only special was on wine and beer and no food. I don't drink either but no biggie. I ordered bruschetta and my friend ordered mussels. My bruschetta was good, pretty basic. My friend raved about the mussels. The service was great as we had various people coming up and checking on us and making recommendations...one of which was a carbonara dish. I checked in on Yelp and we got 10% off which was nice.   We moved to the dining room to join our large party for dinner. We we're given some wine options and our waiter took our drink orders. I thought the waiter was knowledgeable and pretty good. So on to the food...me and my friend decided to each order a dish that we would split with each other. She got the penny vodka and I ordered the carbonara dish that was recommended to us...oh its also not on the menu fyi. He was a little confused at first but I told him a waiter recommended it and he was accomodating. Food was ok...not over the top good but decent. The bill came and I was charged for linguine with clams...apparently they have to ring it up as that as they said it was the same price... $25! That is very pricey for linguine carbonara.  My friend's penny vodka was $18...no meat! They messed up on boxing it up too but another sever was quick to fix it. It was good personal service but it's very pricey for what it is. Going with a Groupon is the way to go here."}
