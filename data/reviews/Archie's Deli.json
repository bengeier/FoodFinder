{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive. The environment is quiet and peaceful. The food is okay, but for the price I feel I should be getting more. It's a nice place to try out, but there are better options around town."}
{"text":"Tried Archie's for the first time today. Was pleased with every aspect of the deli. It has a full bar for those who wish a alcohol beverages. The food was delicious. The special was cabbage rolls which were perfect. Loved the homemade potato salad and the complimentary pickles- they even had green tomato pickles like my
mom made. The staff was friendly and added the extra touches like offering take out glasses for our beverages. It has become one of the top restaurants we will enjoy in Surprise. They serve for all three meals."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian dishes; You can't go wrong with the veg hash. They have moved and expanded. Great outside seating and nice addition with the bar, menu extension and longer hours."}
{"text":"There were 19 of us for dinner on a Friday night and everyone got served relatively fast.  The food was awesome.  I had the fish fry which was a special for Friday and the fish was excellent, served with good french fries and cole slaw.  The prices here are very good and they have a huge menu.  Everyone ordered something different and they all looked good.  I would like to go back to try things on the early bird menu which is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Admittedly, they had a great pastrami.  Only concern was price.  Haven't decided if the $/taste ratio is quite in line for me."}
{"text":"Archies is just ok. Their food is mediocre and microwaved. I wish some more effort would be put into the food and the service is uninviting, and rude at times. It is really a hit or miss place. I do really wish for some higher quality food because New York Flavor is a very short walk away and I can better food for cheaper over there. And it is very pricey so be warned."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this past weekend. We were craving gourmet sandwiches. This place hit the spot pretty well. We had just worked out and were STARVING. It was a good thing they brought out a plate of pickles and pickled tomatoes. I thought they were a little salty, but hit the spot in our post-workout state of starvation. We both ordered different types of pastrami sandwiches. They were huge! I mean it probably had about 15 layers of pastrami! they are the types of sandwiched I picture the firefighters in New York eating! The meat itself was ok, a little dry but very flavorful. It was also a bit fatty for my taste. The bread was my favorite part! The pumpernickel was toasted to perfection! I have to admit, an $11 pastrami sandwich is a little pricey, but you do get twice the meat you would get at other deli's. What's outrageous is that you can pay $4 more to get twice the meat! That's enough meat for 4 sandwiches. 

I would definitely return, but I can't say it was the best pastrami I have had. On our way out, we saw a bunch of guys with these big plates of omelets. I will be back for those."}
{"text":"Well yesterday's plan to have Corned Beef and Cabbage hit a big problem. I went to Archie's early so we so we would not have a long wait for our table. I arrived at 3:12 P.M. and told the hostess we had a party of 15, and I knew we could not have a reservation, but wanted to get set up and told her we would start arriving at 3:30 P.M. The hostess and a waitress went back and set up our tables so we could sit down, but told us we had to wait until we had all assembled because they had a policy of not seating partial parties.

Well other parties of people came in and were seated right away while we waited and waited for our tables. I looked in the front dining room and there were 4+ tables open, but not together. I looked in the back dining room and there were many tables open, but there were no tables setup together for us anymore.

I looked for the hostess, spotted her coming out of the kitchen, and asked her why our tables were no longer set up? She said the owner made her take them apart and seat people in them as they came in. I approached the owner and asked him \"why did you have the hostess take our tables apart\" I asked in a normal conversational tone and did not use and bad language. He said we do not accept reservations. I then said \"I am aware of that, but I was here waiting\", the owner he then said to me \"Watch how you talk to me or I will not seat you at all\".

I just could not believe an owner would use that tone and be so rude to a customer. I was so upset I left Archie's and several of us went to Golden Corral where we were seated pretty quickly and had a nice reasonable meal. I will never go back to Archie's and I am posting this report on Yelp. I hope you all managed to have a good meal in spite of this."}
{"text":"Wanted to add to my review that Archie's did credit the bad sandwiches I ordered to go. I am sure there are many tasty items on the menu. I just cannot recommend the brisket unless they change their ways. I do know what brisket is supposed to be like. When I am with my in-laws again on that side of town and they would like to order deli I would try it again, just not the brisket."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this deli.  We've tried it once before and were unimpressed with the quality of food and felt that it was way over priced for a sandwich place.  We decided to give it another try and were even more disappointed this time.  I made a phone in to go order and when I picked it up it cost $25.00 for a Reuben sandwich and a half of chicken salad sandwich.  I ordered the half sandwich on sourdough and when I got home it was on rye.  The chicken salad was like it was from a can mixed with sandwich spread.  I also ordered, what was listed on the menu as, oven baked chips and what I got was a small bag of potato chips that you can get at the check out line from any Circle K.  Never again will we go back.  Next time I'll stay home and open a can of chicken and mix it with sandwich spread and grab a bag of chips from Circle K and save myself $23.50."}
{"text":"I met a couple of friends at Archies for 1st time for breakfast, the server recommend & stated they have the best biscuits & gravey. 
Please believe me they do NOT have the best, there was way too much pepper , very thick & no sausage. I was very disappointed.
Tried to explain to the server, it was observed, in one ear & out the other, did not offer another option or no one from management came to our table to try to take of the issue. Very sad never going there again, bad experience & no one cared from the business."}
{"text":"We like going to this place because when can always get right in and the service is good. I typically order off there breakfast menu, I have not been disappointed so far."}
{"text":"Not a big deal, inside looks lime a russian dmv. Pastrami is excellent!! But cole slaw was sour! , ordered glass of water, never got it, sorry , wont be back!"}
{"text":"Pastrami on toasted hoagie with Coleslaw and Russian dressing was amazing.  Finished it off with some homemade rice pudding & a chocolate dipped macaroon.  Amazing Food!!"}
{"text":"Been to this Deli twice. The first time I went for lunch and was not impressed with the food for the price. I went back a second time for breakfast. Ordered an Omelet. The ingredients were practically non existent. Again the food was not worth the price. I give it two stars because the service is great from the servers. Very friendly and helpful. Too bad their not the cooks as well! I may give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast. Seating had food crumbs on it. The menu was also dirty, it made me want to leave but I was hungry enough to stay. I'm glad I did. The French toast was great. Service was very good. 1 star for cleanliness but 5 stars for the French toast. Don't know if I'll go back for awhile, I think they need some time to clean things up."}
{"text":"Had breakfast  here for the first  time,food was ok service  not so much  waitress  neever cabe back to refill  coffee  till  we were done with our meal also toast took awhile to get."}
{"text":"We love Archie's Deli.  Their early bird special is great.  A little smaller portions but will still fill you up.  Their corned beef is always great.  Love their Friday Fish Fry, only served on Fridays.  Friendly staff and great food.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a New York style deli like Katz's where the pastrami is made in house, etc.. Still have not found it but Archies will do in a pinch. I tried the JP Pastrami on rye with mustard and it was big and tasty. I also tried the cheese steak hoagie. The hoagie was big and well made with lettuce, onions, tomato and all but the beef was a bit chewy. Not the highest quality meat but over all a tasty sandwich that was so big I could only eat half. The cole slaw is pretty good too. I will return to try something else. Archies will be my go to deli when I'm not feeling Jason's. I'll continue to look for a deli with meats made in house and sliced thick and juicy. OK, I've made myself hungry so maybe another trip to Archies is in order. Oh, I almost forgot, they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Way too expensive.  Not sure how long this place will be in business.  Seemed to be about double the price of any other respectable deli and the food was mediocre.  Go to Downtown Deli or Miracle Mile, better food at half the price."}
{"text":"The only reason I know about this place is because a groupon was offered a few months back. I used to live in this area of Tempe but never noticed this place before, even though its in a pretty big building. I was expecting it to be in like a strip mall and a smaller space. I looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded pretty good. And there was more than one, so I figured why not try it out. I would have been better off skipping this one.

So my husband and I went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there, which always makes me uncomfortable. My husband asked the guy if its always this dead and he didn't really give us an answer which makes me believe that the staff doesn't have much to do all day. Three more parties came in while we were still there. The service was fast, I'll give them that. I have been to some places before where its been pretty dead, and the service is slower than it should be. So the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order. My husband tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty. So I tasted them, and they tasted like they were dipped in salt. There were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato? But I was too afraid to try them to be sure. Then she comes back and takes our order. I got a vegetarian hash with some rye toast. I thought all sandwiches came with a side, but mine didn't. Which is fine, I wasn't that hungry anyway. My husband got a mozzarella, tomato, and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries. My hash was not what I thought it would be. When you think of a hash, you think crispy potatoes, full of veggies, and just really tasty. Mine was none of those things. It was mushy potatoes, and little tiny bits of vegetables. The rye was decent. Nothing special. My husbands sandwich was better than mine. I wish I had gotten something else. The waitress even asked how it was, and I told her it wasn't anything special.

Most of the sandwiches are really overpriced. Most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around $11, which seems really steep for this kind of place. Maybe they have to make up for the fact that they have no business? I don't know. This place would probably do better in an only take out environment in a smaller space and lowered the price of their sandwiches to a more reasonable price. 

I doubt I will be back unless someone else pays for the meal. The food was not good enough that I was like \"I need to come back here tomorrow!\" and it was really expensive for what it was, even though the portions were pretty big."}
{"text":"OK I Grew up in LA and there are plenty good Deli's, here in Phoenix there are only a few, and Archie's is one of them.  The 1/2 sour pickles are great, then comes the Matzo Ball soup (Yes they float), made me feel like grandma just made it for me.  Lets talk Meat The \"Double Jeopardy\" Holds 1/2 LB of Pastrami and 1/2 lb of Coned beef on 2 slices of rye with a slice of Pumpernickel in the middle. One of the best Sandwiches I ever had! Sorry no room for desert, but don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"food was good  service time was vary slow, wait and waited  the waiter throw the bill at me .
Who fault ? i would say Management  not enough staff saw MANAGER walking around with is face in cell phone texting and not helping staff i,ll let fellow SUN CITY people know food was good but staff don\"t care."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite place to eat in Surprise and this is it. I found this place today and gave it a try (apparently only been open for 3 weeks). I love delis, and this one is awesome. It is a New York style deli with lot of seating and my pastrami sandwich was one of the best ever. Loved it. I will be back to this place many, many times. Nice atmosphere and the service was good too - but best of all the food was great. Well worth a try for anyone."}
{"text":"First of all we are so glad that you didn't go out of business, however had If i had not owned a computer and was nosey enough to search you out we would not have known where you moved too.

With that said same great food, people are very friendly,  prices, well, I had a HALF turkey sandwich, with the Mac salad, and hubby had pastrami with potato salad.  We both had water, and the check was $20 before tip.  For lunch, in this area that is still a bit pricey.  

We would come more often or order dessert if the prices where lower,"}
{"text":"We decided to check Archie's out for breakfast.  We saw the menu online and figured we'd give it a shot since there isn't much of a selection of breakfast places (besides chain restaurants  i.e. IHOP, Village Inn) in Surprise.  Read all kinds of great reviews for the sandwiches, soups etc.  Hoped breakfast would be the same.  NOT.  EVEN.  CLOSE.

Service was  very friendly but also very, very slow.  We were seated right away but waited quite some time for our drink order to be taken (which was not by our waitress) and then took another 10 minutes for her to appear.

I ordered the Denver omelet with home fries.  We'll start with the home fries.  Mush.  Nothing but mush.  I didn't order mashed potatoes but that's basically what I got.  Not impressed.

The omelet was the worst I've ever had.  The eggs were put in a skillet, cooked on one side and then flipped like a burger and cooked through on the other side.  It looked like an egg frisbee.  The ham, onions and peppers were just there.  No cheese at all either.   No ingredients cooked into the egg like you see when it is made properly.  Terrible.

My wife ordered the breakfast burrito which was good.  Decent flavor.  That's the only reason I didn't give this 1 star.

We will try here again one more time to try the Rueben's.  If that disappoints, we'll never go here again."}
{"text":"We watched so many businesses fold at this location. It's a horrible mall that doesn't offer easy access to the businesses. 

So long Archies. I will miss your vegetarian hash."}
{"text":"Let's count the restaurants near here in order importance: Archie's Deli, Circle K, Kobe Steak House, and the Olive Garden. Oi, what can I say about Archie's other than good food. I have been there for breakfast and dinner and each serving is exceptional."}
{"text":"I ate there last week had a pastrami sandwich was average at best not impressed whatsoever and 14.95 go to New York flavor ten times better and priced better."}
{"text":"My husband loves small, family-owned delis and so we seek them out wherever we visit.  He swears Archie's has the best Pastrami sandwich he's ever eaten! I enjoyed the Italian sandwich/sub. The coleslaw was yummy too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the open faced roast beef. No seasoning whatsoever! Service was good and the coleslaw was tasty but won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered from here, and absolutely the last. The food is actually good, but the service is about the worst I've ever come across. They should be completely embarrassed but seem not to care. Last year when my father in law passed away we ordered delivery from here and they no showed. When we finally got ahold of someone they figured out that they forgot the order because we had placed it a few days prior. They delivered it and didn't charge the delivery fee. The food was very good, so all was forgiven. My mother in law passed away today and I thought to order from here again. When we called it turned out they don't deliver anymore. No big deal, I can pick it up. I show up at 6pm to get my order, and once again they completely forgot. The order was taped to the wall and no one had bothered with it. I am still standing here at 645 for a 6pm pick up.  Never again.... After calling in to complain they apologized and offered to buy us lunch the next day. That was a nice gesture after all of the mess ups."}
{"text":"The staff was nice the food was not that great. But a tuna sandwich for $12 are you kidding me? My husband and I ended up sharing it but wish we didn't have to I was still hungry after. The potato salad wasn't the greatest not bad for a restaurant but I'm spoiled with mine. They also sat us at a table where it smelled like cat pee so it made eating hard to finish!! Not sure if I want to go back there again. Was really bummed since I really like deli's."}
{"text":"Good stuff! I've been out in Surprise a few months now and on the suggestion of a friend, decided to stop and check this place out. It's buried behind the Chase bank on Litchfield & Bell roads...probably why we have never stopped there before. It's definitely a nice change of pace from all the restaurants out this way. Yes, $10-$12 for a sandwich is expensive, but you're getting A LOT of deli meat. I'd rather pay a few bucks more for a sandwich like this than something processed from a fast food place. I got the J.P.'s Pastrami Special and could only eat 1/2 of it. The rye bread was perfectly grilled, giving the sandwich a nice crunch to it. It's not just a take out deli, either. They've got booth seating up front and tables/chairs in the back. Nothing fancy, but it must not be too bad...the place was packed when I went.  If you're looking for something different, give this place a try. I'm sure I'll be heading back again soon."}
{"text":"Worth EVERY penny!!!the food & service are amazing!! The sandwiches are perfect the pickles are perfect & the cheesecake ohhhhh my!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We made arrangements with Rick ahead of time and  in person for our group to have lunch - time and location were confirmed the day of the luncheon. When we arrived nothing we had been promised was available.  There was an unnecessary wait and service was very slow. The manager was rude , confrontational and never apologized for the fact that we did not get what had been arranged. Ladies room is not cared for. Good but overpriced sandwiches.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Dined on a Saturday night, it was busy. Snacked on the plate of pickles. Tasty. Ordered chili and latkes to get started. Chili was ok, Latkes were decent had to request applesauce and sour cream. 

Ordering an Italian sandwich in a Jewish Deli wasn't the brightest on my part, but I wanted to see how it was. Not great, as you can probably imagine. Meats were overly salted, and the Italian bread was unlike any other Italian bread I've had before.

Pastrami/corned beef  Ruebens are the way to go. Tasty, but pricey."}
{"text":"Finally... a great place to eat in Surprise!  This is a family owned deli and it shows in all that they do.  If you are looking for a \"jewish\" style deli, this IS it.  We also were sold on a HUGE piece of chocolate cake that will probably take us a couple of days to finish.  The vibe is great, the owner Rick was friendly and we are excited to have a neighborhood deli, check it out!

Someone mentioned something about the menu and the prices however, for what you get it is more than worth it."}
{"text":"I had heard the name before, but never gone to Archie's until Sunday.  We went for lunch on a whim.  I am glad we did.  The food was really good.  I got a BBQ brisket sandwich on challah (no clue how to pronounce that) and my wife got the BBQ chicken on challah.  

The price was a little high, but we got a lot of good food for the price, so to me... It was completely worth it.  I will definitely make this a regular place.

Warning though... A LOT of people seem to go here on holidays.  My wife and I were going to stop by yesterday for lunch (Saint Patrick's Day) and it was PACKED."}
{"text":"Expensive.  Sandwiches were not that big, the meat was just piled in the middle so when they were sliced they give the illusion of being packed.  $12-14 for a sandwich, $2 for coffee and $5 for bland cheesecake, not worth it."}
{"text":"The hugely portioned food was good, with the exception of the pickles that come wrapped in foil along with sandwich orders.

Price, however was a bit outrageous. For three of us to order ONLY sandwiches, the total was about $50! OUCH!!

The carpet is filthy and needs to be replaced, as does the hostess stand which is the first thing I noticed upon entering. 

Something I noticed after placing our order is a cucumber soda. Sounds interesting, but I didn't buy it."}
{"text":"Never will I eat here again!  \"fresh\" fruit salad came with mold.  When I pointed it out to the waitress she offered me yet another bowl of the same moldy old fruit.  Hey people, your fruit needs to be thrown away when it gets moldy, ever heard of the health department...too bad because I would love to find a restaurant in Surprise that
 served a salad I would not be afraid to eat"}
{"text":"I went there once for some take out. I was very disappointed in the service and the food. 4 items and 2 canned sodas took 45 minutes to bring out. I got NY deli style food. Chicken noodle soup, 2 knishes and another item. The soup wasn't terrible when it was hot but the knishes didn't look like any knish I've ever had let alone taste like one. I won't ever go back. I hope they improve their customer service as well as their food."}
{"text":"A bit pricey and the pastrami is sometimes too fatty.  However, on a good day you can get an excellent pastrami sandwich and some very good pickles.  On the very best days they'll give you more than one pickled green tomato per pickle-plate.  If they lowed their prices 1 - 1.5 dollars per sandwich, I'd be here more often."}
{"text":"Well...I have found my new favorite place to grab a good sandwich for lunch while here in Arizona.  Friendly staff and good music as well as the lovely display cases with some mouthwatering desserts make a good first impression.  While looking at the many options on the menu our server brought some tasty pickles as well as pickled tomatoes which I've never had but not bad at all.  As far as food goes my husband ordered a half pastrami sandwich and I had to try a bite.  Juicy, warm spiced just right pastrami was complimented with the right amount of sauerkraut and Russian dressing.  I had the prime bite which had a perfect roast beef, a cream cheese spread with some caraway.  Lovely addition to the overall flavor of the sandwich.  Even my daughter's grilled cheese on challah bread was toasted perfectly.  Big sandwiches meaning you get your bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The reason for one star is one word-management! I called in a take out order and arrived to pick it up. When the cashier told  me my total it was for a regular menu sandwich.I  said it's the Early Bird price. She said okay and was attempting to correct my bill when the manager came over. He never said hello or even acknowledged me. He asked her \"what are you doing very nastily\" she explained and he snapped again stating that this was the full price size ,grabbing the bag from her and tossing it on the counter. He told the kitchen he needed another one of the smaller size.
His rude attitude and harsh behavior was so un called for. 
At this point I am annoyed by his rude behavior and total lack of customer service. Not to mention the food he wasted. Needless to say Archie's has lost another customer. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Stopped by the other night to pick up a couple sandwhiches to go and spent 30 minutes waiting for a basic chicken sandwich to be cooked.  The place was empty, the girl at the front desk was slow and confused about requesting ranch on the side.  Unfortunately I ordered before I took a look at the prices...$12 minimum for ANY sandwhich.  Outrageous.  Nothing spectacular, could have done better on my own, and faster.  Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped there yesterday and called ahead to tell them that we had 16 guys coming for lunch and as we arrived the manager was a total jerk and decided he wouldn't serve us because all of us but two guys didn't show up.  Probably won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to eat here after a failed attempt at the Farmer's Market down the street...sandwiches were tasty, but not sure about $11 each tasty?! We had a club and some sort of turkey sandwich w/roasted onions, both with sides of fries. 
Before you order they set down a bowl of pickled green tomatoes and pickles. As my friend said: they're trying to hard to make a special pickle. Maybe you just crack open a jar of Vlasic's.
Now, the service absolutely sucked. No drink refills and nobody cared how we were doing or if we liked the food. We had to venture behind the counter ourselves to find a to-go box and paying the check took forrrrrrever! Had we pulled a dine and dash, nobody would've noticed.
We decided to take dessert with us--which involved browsing at the counter. Now, suddenly, there were 4 people at the counter hovering. It became so awkward that we just chose something and left.
Not too sure what red velvet is actually supposed to taste like, but this cupcake had absolutely no flavor. Nothing. Mixed opinions on the cream cheese frosting. The macaroon was pretty yummy overall."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be fair to compare to Katz's, Carnegie or Stage deli in NYC....but for Surprise AZ, the corned beef and pastrami are pretty good.  

I ordered Corned beef and Pastrami at the counter to take home.  Service was soooo painfully slow, and waiting for the ticket to pay was even more painful. I had to ask for Challah and half sour pickles, because I didn't see any at the counter...I was told they were in the back.  Hmmmm?  If you want to sell something, people have to know you have it to sell.

With that being said, the meats were good. Sliced thin, very fresh and moist. Liked the pastrami better than the corned beef, but both were tasty. 

Coleslaw was very good, and I piled that on my challah bread, to make a sandwich.  Challah was delish.  Very eggy, soft and light on the inside.  They sliced it for me, a bit thick, next time I will ask for it sliced thinner.

Potato knish, I have to say, was good too....A little different outside than I am used to, but tasty as well.  Filled with lots of onion and creamy potatoes.  They also have meat and veggie knish's.

My favorite, the half sour pickle.  Hard to come by around here, and you have to ask for them, because they are not in the deli case.  As a pickle aficionado, I can attest to this being a very good half sour!

For tomorrow morning, I got a small amount of nova lox cream cheese for my bagel ( which I buy elsewhere), and gotta tell you, that is one heck of a good cream cheese. 

The restaurant is good sized and they have a nice shaded patio dining area too.  I don't know what the old place looked like, but this place is clean, large, lots of parking and was pretty crowded at lunch time on a Tuesday afternoon. 

Next time I go, I'm trying the potato salad and picking up some chive cream cheese....maybe a blintz or two."}
{"text":"I have a deep love of deli food. I have been to all the greats in New York and I have been known to drive an hour (one way mind you) to Chompies when the craving for a knish, giant sandwhich and a black and white strikes. Imagine my joy when I discovered a New York deli on the west side of town!

The decor here is drab. It reminds me of an old, almost run down diner. Our waitress was adorable and provided great service. She was the only good thing about this place. 

The matzo ball soup (which should be a delicious staple) was bland, lukewarm and not so good. I have made better matzo balls from a box mix. My husbands open face turkey sandwhich sounded good. He was delivered a slice of microwave dinner tasting turkey on challah, covered in congealed brown gravy. The mashed taters were lumpy. It just....did not taste right. The kasha we got on the side was inedible. We were served bowls of beige mush with bow tie pasta. It was over cooked and one of the worst things I have ever eaten. Considering all the side consists of is cooked grain and some pasta, this is pretty sad.

I had a brisket sandwhich. The challah it was on was good. It stopped there. The meat was bland, HORRIBLY fatty. It also just...did not look right. It was shiny and greasy. I have eaten and cooked many a brisket in my day and I have never seen brisket look like that. About 1/3 way through one half of the sandwhich, I felt like I was going to be sick. The \"russian dressing\" was super thick, looked course and tasted like poorly mixed together ketchup and mayo with some relish thrown in.

Depsite the bad meal, we thought to try dessert. The carrot cake had a strange after taste and the red velvet cupcake was just the blandest dessert I have ever had. It was very dry.

The only reason why I think this place has the rating it does is because there is no competition over here. At the end of the day, I would rather eat at Dennys."}
{"text":"Decent pastrami sandwich but the customer service was so blatantly bad it completely overshadowed the food. No hello from the hostess, sat down and handed a menu. No goodbye from what appeared to be the manager who made direct eye contact when I walked out the door. Server was rather rough around the edges and when trying to gauge size difference for a lunch sandwich I asked, \"how big is the half sandwich?\" and she replied, \"about half the size of the full sandwich.\"  I look forward to reviewing the next restaurant that leases this space because with pathetic customer service like this, the business will not last due to so much competition at this price point in the area."}
{"text":"Food is great. My mom is a big fan of the pickles and pickled tomatoes. Coleslaw is very good. I actually miss the old location. The new location is OK, but harder to get to the parking lot and it may look like it's larger, but once inside feels much smaller than old location."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich was good as were the fries but at $19 and some change ($16 and change for the meal and $3 tip) for one person to have a sandwich, fries and iced tea is a bit too steep for lunch. And it wasn't a huge sandwich like I've had in other deli's for a cheaper price. Normally I only eat half of a deli sandwich and bring the other half home. Not here, ate the whole thing.

Too bad because I liked the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"We came here after searching for a sandwich place for our visiting Gramma.  Had the matzo ball soup and it was awesome.  I've had it only one other time in my life so I'm not exactly a conessiour per say.  The sandwich wasn't bad either -  a vegetarian - Rosa's Walk in the Park.  I guess I'm just not used to the bread on a sandwich being in deep heavy oil and crispy so I didn't care for it much but the ingredients inside were good.  The fries was also not very good.  Sounds like I should give it 2 stars but what I did have wasn't bad ... just not really what I'm used to I guess.  I definitely want to come here again and try some of the other menu items and this time, I will give the salad or coleslaw a try instead of fries.  It was definitely good enough to try again!"}
{"text":"Great food and Friendly service.  New location is great and easy access.   Sandwiches are huge and lots of meat.  So I get the half sandwich with is more than enough.  I recommend the turkey sandwich it's great.  I give this place a 5 stars because it's a great value for quality food.   Deserts are homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have had 20+ meals at Archie's and have loved everything! Service is a little slow but if you don't mind a wait, you won't be disappointed!!! Their breakfast is excellent! They have typical items and specialties that you cannot find everywhere! Yay! Lunch and dinner don't disappoint either! Their dessert are divine! Slices of cake are huge! Amazing bread pudding! We've been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today for lunch. There were 2 crickets that greeted me at the waiting area one dead and mushed in the crept nod one barely alive!  It was dirty, the bathrooms were filthy and no changing table. I ordered a small  scoop of egg salad for my 15 month old and was charged $7.00. I myself got a sandwich and a soda. All together my bill was $30.00 for 1 adult and 1 child for lunch. The food was \"ok\" but nothing like a north east deli which is where I'm from.
  I'm a fool for staying,"}
{"text":"Great food and large portions! The biscuits and gravy are the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Best sammiches in Surprise hands down.  I love their pastrami and cheese steak and they have some awesome desserts here too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Walked into the bar area. Seated ourselves. There were 3 tables with people at them. Servers walked by and never made eye contact. We walked out!! Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"While the food was fine, but nothing special, the service was terrible. Everything was slow and the waitress didn't care at all. The home fries are terrible, half of them were burned, and the hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict wasn't great."}
{"text":"Our service was excellent and the food was fantastic! Randy was extremely helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Archie's deli . Our server promptly greeted us with a smile and the specials of the day with service in a professional manner that you would expect of a fine dining experience.  Archie's Ruben sandwich was delicious and Archie gained a new customer"}
{"text":"Glad to learn you moved to a new location as your old place was pretty shabby (i.e., worn-out seating, dirty floor covering, restrooms needed attention).  Now we understand why the last 3 times we ate the old place, the food was not as good as our previous visits...as you were focused on new location & hopefully a new chef/cooks.  The stuffing that came w/my husband's turkey dinner was like something Gordon Ramsey finds in those nasty dirty kitchens. Even his 2 bites & my one bite that I spit out, made us both sick within an hour.  But, your lox & bagel platter in the best!"}
{"text":"Great sandwichs but come in at $11-15 a sandwich I might as well get a steak! Honestly when we got the menu we were in shock! NY deli prices not Surprise AZ."}
{"text":"I tried Archies for the first time for breakfast. I wanted just a simple breakfast. I ordered a simple breakfast burrito & my daughter ordered the breakfast crepes. The waitress seemed kinda in a brain fog, like she just woke up, anyway, 
My daughter order came with 2 very small crepes I was shocked and thought are you kidding me these were $8.50??? it seriously was a joke! My order the breakfast burrito was served w/ a green vegetable tortilla with what seemed to be turkey/chicken sausage the eggs tasted like they were powdered, I thought the portion was very small also, and the quality wasn't very good, the taste was bland I had to add salt just to get it down...
My daughter said that her crepes were gross and she tried to get rid of the taste,, the crepes left her with a tummy ache.

For two very very small crepes and a very small green tortilla with turkey surprise meat and powder tasting eggs, 1 orange juice ....NO JOKE THE PRICE TOTALED $30.00 !!!! NOT WORTH THE FOOD! NOR DOES NOT MATCH THE QUALITY!

I would have had a much better fresh breakfast with fresh made biscuits, sausage & eggs, large Orange Juice & fresh hotcakes  for 2 at MCDONALDS! for under $10 DOLLARS!!!!!!!

I will never patronize this place again, and will recommend to anyone to not go there either....it's a waste of money and time...."}
{"text":"Had a great meal. My husband had a great lean corned beef sandwich. The cabbage soup was perfect and my tongue hit the spot. My  mother-in-law had a super matzah ball soup with bagel chips and I love sour pickles. Look forward to going back when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"ARCHIES IS NOT A JEWISH DELI. Anyone who thinks it is has never been to a real Jewish deli...period. I have been to Archies a handful of times. I can honestly say it has gone severely down hill. The food was ummmm.not good. Service was so so at best. Archies sucks and that is down from ugggh. The matzoh ball soup is a crime to matzoh ball soup. The pastrami and corned beef was really bland.....and tasteless. it would be the laughing stock of \"delis\" for about 4 days until it closed in a Jewish neighborhood. Do not kid yourself...."}
{"text":"Very pricey, Price for what you get this is Surprise not Manhattan. I get a little nervous spending 13 bucks on a sandwich! Unless it's high-end location.  
There's another New York style deli half a block away just as good but a 1/3 less price wise."}
{"text":"Sandwich was delicious very large. The potato salad was excellent. Great menu. As far as I'm concerned this is the best deli I found on the west side."}
{"text":"Awful. So not impressed!! I had the chicken noodle soup and a sandwich. I honestly thought for the price it would be a bigger portion or like have some kind of magic deliciousness to it that would make it worth it. Nope. I might as well of opened a can of progresso and a can of chicken at home. So disappointed. Never would I recommend. Service was bad as well."}
{"text":"The Manager here is an idiot this guy has an ego way to big for his own good. The food is good but over priced but because of Management I will never return."}
{"text":"Let me first preface the 2 starts with the fact that if a sandwich wasn't severely overpriced at $11 it would have done much better. 

Decided to try them for lunch.  Was surprised when entering through the door that it was a sit-down style.  For some reason I expected this to be a standard deli style, similar to a Miracle Mile deli.  

Was even more surprised when I got the menu and saw the prices.  Sandwiches were between $9 and $12.  Yes they larger, however, they are similar sized to any traditional deli sized.  They do come with a side.

I ordered the pastrami sandwich which came with a side of potato salad.  Once gain, I was disappointed.  It was served on sourdough bread (not a traditional rye bread) and it was not toasted (once again a pastrami is usually toasted).  The bread was also room temperature.  All in all the sandwich wasn't anything special, definitely not worth my $11.  Would be much better in the $7 range.  The potato salad side was OK, but nothing special.

Place did have a decent crowd, but it took 15 minutes to get our food (all sandwiches).  Not sure what took so long since they were all sandwiches, nothing to cook.

Meal, drink and tip was $15.  I usually don't even pay that much for dinner!"}
{"text":"Used to like this place now the prices are nuts and the pastrami was very dry the last two times I went there and at 13.95 I'll pass"}
{"text":"Because I can go here after work, have a drinky drink, watch some game, and not have to have a conversation with the closest drunkard.

Because I can go here on Sunday morning, on my bicycle (get those bike racks soon) and not have to dress up in my Sunday all get out best.

Because if I want a whoopie pie, carrot cake slice, brownie, red velvet cupcake, peach cobbler, and a bowl of rice pudding for my own house party, I don't have to buy more than what I need.

Because Archies is the kind of place, where you can just relax, eat, be happy and leave, and be home in a matter of minutes. It's just a great little place."}
{"text":"Just ate there this past weekend had a pastrami sandwich it was really good, and very filling, price was a bit high for a sandwich so will only go back occasionally would like to try soup and bagels as well! Service was very good and waitress answered all our questions with a smile!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this play after driving by. Very blah inside...was greeted and seated right away. Had typical deli meals..roast beef, pastrami, lox, etc...we went for breakfast. I ordered French toast, gf ordered hash. French toast came with a bagel and hash came with toast, home fries, and 2 eggs. French toast was great by itself(cinnamon and fluffy). Bagel was
Mediocre. Hash looked ground and brown. It tasted, I guess, a bit old. Home fries were really good had sauteed onion. 

Now on to the real issue..two tables
Next to us were ready whispering (complaining). Made me wonder. Guess the server forgot to add sausage but assured him it would be ready when his pancakes were. Guess what! Pancakes came out but the sausage didn't. Owner came and rectified the situation. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed. She was okay, seemed timid but she got everything right so. I would come back for lunch or dinner..the egg sandwiches looked good."}
{"text":"There is nothing in there but old people. The waitresses are weird. I got a burger and it was sooo greasy the only thing good about was the fries. My friend got a salad and the croutons were stale and they ended up not charging us for it. Will NEVER go there again. The prices are way too expensive also."}
{"text":"My husband and I made our first visit to Archie's today for the best breakfast we've eaten anywhere. The lox benedict was heavenly, and the homefries were the perfect accompanyment. We also shared an order of chopped chicken livers which melted in our mouths.

The service at Archie's was outstanding. Neither too lax nor overbearing. A visit to our table by the owner was icing on the cake. But what will really bring us back to Archies is the food. If you're looking for a REAL Deli experience, look no further than Archie's in Surprise AZ. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"visited them for dinner last night. ordered the brisket  dinner expecting   slices of a nicely roasted cut of meat. what we got of more like roast beef that fell apart, covered in an unexciting brown gravy. anywhere else where we ordered brisket we got nicely cooked brisket  with firmness and juicy slices of meat. NOT HERE. The owner manager seemed to not care, this was his brisket and he has made it for 20 years. I understand  that  this  restaurant  has many favorable  reviews, I can't  give the brisket anything but thumbs down, would never order again here. Everyone  raves  about  the  food and I'm  sure  it  is  good  or better, just  order  something else."}
{"text":"Another great visit! Met up with 2 friends and enjoyed the Grilled Cheese and tomato basil soup. Perfect on a freezing cold day like today. Friends had the reuben and the pastrami and both loved them. 1/2 size is the perfect size sandwich there but if you've got an appetite, Archie's can sure feed ya!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happen to Archies!  I used to go there only for breakfast because it was the best place in Surprise for the most important meal of the day.  Is it too much to ask for an egg to be cooked medium well?  I can not stomach an egg that is practically raw - you know, the egg white runny.  Despite asking specifically that the egg white to be cooked I consistently get a barely warm egg!  

I have now stopped going to Archie's and I no longer recommend it to my customers (I drive an airport shuttle and had encouraged this place to literally thousands of people)."}
{"text":"I do recommend this place for their great breakfast dishes and gut busting sandwiches and I like the fact that it's not a chain restaurant like about 95% of the other eateries in Surprise.  

But I really do wish the breakfast cook knew how to cook an egg.  I have NEVER had a medium-well egg in this place.  (A med-well egg is flipped, unbroken yolk, yolk cooked to have a firm but wet-appearing center).  I hate it when the egg white is runny and the only way to get an eatable egg at Archies is to order a scrambled egg or a well done egg.  And my last complaint about Archies is that sometimes the waitresses can get a bit distracted which means the service suffers a bit.  Don't you just hate it when they never come back for a refill on your coffee?

Other than those two issues this is a good place to visit for a good (not great) breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has been around long enough that I am ashamed I've never tried it. Now I can say I found a new lunch spot. When we first walked in, there was nobody to be found. Having never been here we werent sure wether to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After a while we spotted the bar on the other side of the partition and decided to seat ourselves there. It was another few minutes before the bartender finally came out of the back and greeted us. She was super friendly and knew exactly how to direct new customers through the menu. She made a great first impression for the restaurant. 

I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and my girlfriend had a turkey sandwich of some sort. We were both impressed with our meals and enjoyed the conversation with the bartender. With the exception of our initial impression that nobody worked there, this joint is a winner. I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"When we walked in yesterday we were hopeful to find a closer option than Chompie's for good deli. We were wrong. My kids had just gotten over a stomach bug, so we ordered them the chicken noodle soup. My husband watched the waitress dish it in a bowl, and then microwave it! If we wanted microwaved soup, we wouldn't have paid $4.50 a bowl!
I ordered a vegetarian sandwich in an attempt to eat something fresh, and it had so much cheese and butter I couldn't finish it, I didn't realize I was getting a grilled cheese sandwich with a few vegetables! The sandwich I ordered had avocado in it, which I love, but you couldn't taste with all the cheese in it!
My husband ordered the #10, pastrami and rye. It was ok, it's hard to mess up pastrami on rye with mustard, but it wasn't worth $10.50.
We decided to order dessert, got rice pudding (one) for my two girls to share, and a brownie for my husband and I to share. Again, we watched the waitress use the microwave to heat these up! I was so shocked I didn't know what to say to them! It's ridiculous! I'm sure no NY deli in their right minds would use a microwave, and if they did, they'd have the decency to do it in the back away from patrons eyes, it's like a slap in the face!
We paid $50 for 2 adult sandwiches, 2 bowls of soup, 4 drinks, 1 rice pudding, 1 brownie, and 1 black and white cookie. The quality didn't live up to the price and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great beer and epic sandwiches make this a good pick. They need a little help though I the following areas: 
1. Customer service: generally they are very slow to acknowledge you and take an initial drink order. The sandwiches take just as long to make as an entrée at any standard restaurant. 

2. Lame sports on TV. Women's basketball, golf, sports talk and Faux news. C'mon you can do better. 

Other than that the people are good, the sandwiches are amazing and they have excellent craft beer at good bar prices. Don't be discouraged from giving it a try, with a few small changes this place could be amazing!"}
{"text":"It was our second time to this wonderful deli...  Both times we were very happy with the taste of the food!  Fries with ranch rock!!!  French toast and sandwiches are excellent!  Pickles come for a fine Deli touch...  And we tried the other local Deli only to be disappointed that we didn't go to Archie's!!!  We are Archie faithful now!!!  Come and try- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here with my mother and father earlier this week.  It absolutly still looks like a Village Inn, and the cavernous nature, when there are only a few tables full, is a litlte bizarre.  Basically, wherever you sit, you can see the entire restaurant.  I don't like that.

The service was good.  We ordered a couple of Dr. Brown's and sat back to decipher the menu.  Lots of good Jewish food on there.  Mom and Dad opted to split a reuben.  My father is notorious for ordering Reubens then saying \"It's not as good as Stan's,\" an old deli is Scottsdale.  

I got the meat platter, which had corned beef, pastrami, and tounge, as well swiss, potato salad and cole slaw.  I knew it was going to be way too much food, but I figured I'd get a taste of everything.  

I ordered some kugel, which we ate as an appetizer.  The server asked me if i wanted it cold or microwaved.  I would much prefer \"would you like it cold or warm.\"  I don't want to know you're just going to nuke it.  I'd prefer to think it came straight out of the oven.  I have to say, the kugel is outstanding.  

The meat was quite good, though a touch dry. Pastrami had good fat content and look good.  The corned beef had nice marbling and a good flavor.  The tounge, whch I don't normally eat, was also good.  The salads were workable as well.  Dad seemed to enjoy his reuben, and didn't make any negative comments, which means it was excellent.  

Overall, the experience was good, but it was slow.  I'm sure it doesn't help that they don't even have a lighted sign (mom and dad drove right past it).  It looks like a work in process inside, but the food seems to be on the money."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times since my initial review and all I have to say is I love this place. 

I'm glad it's a bit of a drive from home because I'd be here way to often if it wasn't..."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a sandwich here! Turkey Reuben was perfectly grilled and just the right amount of coleslaw & sauce. Love their potato salad and fries.

The service was good and everything I tasted was great.  Why 3 stars you ask?  The decor is weak and the prices are high.  I don't think they can compete with Chompies & Jason's Deli.  We went on a Friday night and it was pretty dead.  It seems their take-out business is busy though, they were very busy packing up orders to go."}
{"text":"We have had breakfast to go a few times here. Nothing special! Eggs, bacon, breakfast burrito, hash browns. Food was good, nothing to write home about. Just Yelp it!! We are going to give this place another try since we only had breakfast. So coming soon to the nearest Yelp, will be my update!!"}
{"text":"Archie is now at a new location, they are located at a place that has gone through four other franchises in four years! Takes a lot of guts to make this move. I was never that impressed with them at their old location, this is why I have only been their a couple of times. But recently the wife and I had breakfast there. It was great! I had their bacon, egg, cheese , and bagel sandwich. Very good, going to have it again. Also shared the cinamon apple pancakes. I will never know why I always want to try this special pancakes when I just love the plains! But this was good anyway.  ,Make sure you're hungry, lot's of food, and great dessert."}
{"text":"Archie's is by far my favorite place in Surprise. Everything I've had had been so filling and perfectly delicious. Lots of vegetarian options which is hard to find in a deli! My favorite, favorite part though is the desert. All homemade, and everything (again) that I've tried has been amazing! I stop in regularly for a lemon bar and/or the red velvet cupcakes. Just thinking about them is making me crave it ugh. I'm not a meat eater, but when I see people get their meat sandwiches at other tables they are absolutely so giant and look incredible! Come with an appetite, for sure. All reasonably priced!!!! Thank you Archie's!!!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Archie's Deli before but never wrote a review. I told my friends about it and they were dying to try a new (kosher-style) deli on the west side. We agreed that the \"old place,\" (Why give them a plug HERE?) that has a location near Paradise Valley mall and another in Scottsdale, had been a big disappointment to us recently (rhymes with Rhompies) due to poor and slow table service, crowded facilities, and high prices. 

\"The Guys\" were thrilled with Archie's and so am I (still). Sure, it's not inexpensive to eat there but OMG the sandwiches are delicious, huge (I took the other half of my sandwich home), and not a bad deal at all. Our server was very polite (albeit the fact that I had to work hard to catch her eye for more pickles and crunchy green tomatoes). Our order was taken quickly, we were asked several times how we were enjoying our \"nosh,\" and we didn't have to wait for the check to arrive shortly after being given an opportunity to decide if we wanted dessert.

There are lots of goodies in the bakery and deli cases if you want to take something home for later (e.g., potato and vegetable knishes, chopped liver, red velvet cupcakes, cheesecake, and carrot cake).  

Want to eat cheap? Go to Burger King and order off the dollar menu. Want some noshy nom-noms? Go to Archie's!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Fish fry and a pastrami. Delicious, fries potato salad and coleslaw yummy too. 

Why 3 stars? 

Owners of Archie's deli figure out your hours!!!! We came in a few minutes before 8pm tonight (a Friday) and as we sat down they turned off the open sign. The door and online and on yelp says the close at 10 on Fridays. We asked the server then he goes into a spiel about how usually he leaves work by 8 on Fridays. So we feel bad and rushed to hurry and leave now. As we're getting the check a couple comes in and is pissed that they are \"closed\" I don't blame her if you say you're closed at 10 closing two hours early isn't okay. Post a sign of new summer hours or something!!! Having worked in restaurants for way too long before I hated that last table of the night and waiting for them to leave so I could leave, so when I go out I never go to a restaurant within an hour of them closing because I hate dining with my server looming over me waiting for me to leave. So I will be back but only for a weekend lunch so I'm not being rushed out the door."}
{"text":"We split an talian Grinder $12.00. It was plenty for the two of us and it was delicious. French fries were delicious too. Sat outside, music was fairly loud but nice experience. Definately coming back"}
{"text":"Great Place for Lunch!  The wait staff is very nice and greet you as you come in. I had the double jeopardy sandwich which is half pastrami half corned beef triple decker sandwich! WOW! So much sandwich for the money!"}
{"text":"We're at Archie we had a few drinks and the best fish that we have had in a long time. The best food in Surprise. Anna was the bartender great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place because it is not easily seen from the road. Family of 5 all ate for under 50 bucks including tip!  The food was great, the staff friendly and we were served promptly which is important with kids!"}
{"text":"I went lunch the other day with some friends.  They wanted a good deli, however I don't think this exist in the far west Phoenix metro.  Someone  suggested Archie's so I thought, well it's been a while since my last visit which was not very good, so why not give them another try again.  

They will usually start you off with a small dish of pickles however they did not bring us any on this visit.  I did not ask for them this time since I did not like them on my last visit.  I had their half pastrami sandwich on rye with a side of potato salad.   I was not asked if I wanted my bread toasted this time for some reason.  The bread needed to be toasted for the bread was dry and the crust was too tough to eat.  The pastrami was OK.  They buy their pastrami pre-cooked which makes it a little drier than at a place that cooks their own pastrami.  The potato salad is bland, so I would recommend ordering a different side.  I've had their cole slaw on a prior visit and it's also a bit bland, so you may want to go with fries.  They are not fresh, but might be a better option for a side. 

All in all I find their prices way too high for the quality of food you get at Archie's. They might be the best option if your looking for a deli and your in this area.  I've been to Archie's a couple of times now and it has not changed.  This is a 2 star deli for me based on multiple experiences."}
{"text":"This place is closed. I got a refund on my Groupon. Perhaps the one in Surprise is still in business (?), but I'm in Ahwatukee, and there's no way I'm driving that far, especially with the poor reviews others have given this location. I checked their website, and there is no indication there that the Tempe location is closed."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and services was so slow my wife and I nearly walked out twice.  Saw three or four guys working but all seemed to be avoiding us and there was only 3 tables with guests. I think they were trying to close. This place used to be a place we liked to go but I doubt if we will ever go back."}
{"text":"You want  a testament to how good the food is? My entire family came to visit from the east coast, and after a couple of days of hearing complaints about the food in AZ, I loaded them all up to make the drive out to Archie's. Every single one of them got just what they wanted, and RAVED about the quality! I was made to bring them all out to Archie's two more times over the next five days, and each time better than the last! After their return home, I had several phone calls with various family members about how much they loved Archie's! Not how good it was to see me, about the food at Archie's! Suffice to say next time they are out here, we'll be parked at a booth at Archie's for a good part of their visit! Thanks Archie's!!"}
{"text":"It's a little pricey, but definitely worth it. Got the reuben with pastrami to-go and it was delicious! The house-made pickles were amazing. I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Finlay I found a Ruben that satisfies. I loved this place. From the plate of pickles they give you when you sit down to the melt in your mouth rye bread and tasty corn beef. it was great. I highly recommend this place if your looking for a good sandwich shop. 

The prices can be a shocker but when you compare how much meat you are getting (1/2 pound), add in the side that comes with it and the plate of pickles, it comes out even. I feel I get my moneys worth, and it taste great."}
{"text":"Super slow service and WAY overpriced. We walked in to place a quick to go order, the lady handed us menus and said the server will be right with you. After making our selection, i stood at the counter for about 6 minutes before the server came to take our order. Ran to the starbucks a few feet away while waiting, and 20 minutes later, we are still waiting for our food. Not worth the $14 for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff but food was very slow coming to the table. We got half of our appetizers before our food which was the most terrible poppers I  ever had and other came with our food as a side instead of fries. The chicken salad sandwich had no taste. The lettuce  was the most tasteful things on the sandwich.  Will give the place another try but not that sandwich."}
{"text":"Sandwich (Turkey Ruben for me and Chicken Club for the hubby) AMAZING. 

Service great.

Price - too high... :("}
{"text":"Yup, I've become a big fan of Archie's.  I'm a big breakfast guy and love the fact you can get it anytime of the day.   The servings tend to be very very large.  The pancakes cover the plate and are impossible to finish, but are oh so good.  The bacon is thick cut and the bread/bagels are great.  I'm not a huge fan of the breakfast potatoes, then to be a bit greasy, but you can substitute for something else.

I've also had several of the lunch menu sandwiches and find them great... love the rubens.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good and when you are looking for an alternative to the franchise chains that line the streets of Surprise, then this is an excellent choice. 

First off, the pickles (free to table) are amazing!!! Like some of the best I've ever had. I had a burger and it also did not disappoint. My wife had a Reuben that was one of the best I have ever tasted that wasn't in manhattan. Very attentive service and I look forward to my next visit. 

However, there is reason I am not giving this place 5 stars. First, it more expensive than it really should be. The sandwich was great, but it wasn't a $12 sandwich. Second, they call it a deli but it's not. It's a sit down restaurant. 

That being said, it's still a great place to eat and I look forward to trying their whole menu. This is the type of place you could go and never get the same thing twice."}
{"text":"Surprise never Surprises me when it comes to a nice dining experience.  It is consistently below average.  It took a long time to be greeted at the table. The lady server was unpleasant and gruff  but seemed to take on a more pleasant attitude later on.  We were served our dinner and did not see her for awhile and then she presented the bill when I was still eating my dinner. \"NO RUSH!\" is what she said as I had my fork to my mouth. Ugh. Fortunately for the business I did notice a young man serving tables near us and his demeanor was awesome and accommodating to the patrons he was serving.  I was envious and would have paid double to be waited on by him.  We rarely have time to eat out, so this is a place we will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"It has three parts: 1. Deli 2. Restaurant 3. Bar This review is for the restaurant. The Liver and Onions are the best. Turkey Dinner is very good. Service is a little slower paced so don't come if you are in a rush. The carrot cake would be better with more chunks of nuts, raisons, carrots and a little more... 
   See rest of review at tripadvisor because it will not let me copy and paste."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. Tasty and lots of meat. Pickles that come out first are good too. Matza ball soup is yummy. Light beers $2 is a great deal. Have gone 3 times and food and service good each time."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch and sat at the bar. Toasted turkey Sandwich overwelming tasted like butter.  Also 2.50 for a club soda with no lime straight from the gun is a pet peeve of mine. On top of that I took three sips just to wash the butter taste from my mouth cause it was bad.  I can have a 18 dollar lunch anywhere and I think I will try somewhere else next time I'm in surprise"}
{"text":"Mommy/daughter day. Went for haircuts nearby and my 10 year old decided to give Jewish deli a try. While we loved the food, the service was awful. Got the early bird special of a corned beef ruben (they split it in the kitchen for us) and I asked to add a bowl of soup (the early bird menu states it is $1.95 to add soup or salad). I asked if the matzo ball soup was available for that. Ended up being charged full price ($4.50) because the server didn't \"understand\" me. Shared the blintzes for dessert. Yum!
All the savory items needed seasoning, but in our area (many seniors) most places under salt. This was no exception. No problem, there is salt on the table. My 10 year old is now a covert to Matzo ball soup!
Our server ignored us most of the time. We sat with our menus closed in front of us for over 10 minutes. Our server only had 1 other table. I paid $2.50 for an iced tea that was never refilled. When our bill turned up wrong, it took me almost 10 minutes to get her attention as she never looked over to our table. Then she ARGUED with me about it. It was my first time there and I knew more about the menu than she did! Finally she said she would pay the difference out of her own pocket. That's a nice way of saying she didn't want to get caught making a mistake. I asked for the manager.
I am generally a really good tipper. I've been a server and/or server trainer for most of my life. When I got the bill, under tip I wrote, \"get a different job\".
I would eat there again, but not with that server or I'd get my food to go."}
{"text":"After 2 recent visits to Archie's I decided to yelp about this place because they are pretty awesome. I used to eat at this place when it was a village inn , so theres a bit of nostalgia. I'm not sure if they are considered a \"Jewish\" deli but they have all sort of yummy Jewish specialties like Kugel and Matzo ball soup. Anyway, I've had their \"Dutchy's\" Pastrami Deluxe sandwich and it was to die for. Home-made toasted rye bread, excellent russian dressing, some of the best cole-slaw I have ever had, and the hot pastrami was piled at least 4 inches high. The thing that made the sandwich standout so much was the fact that the pastrami was no fatty or chewy, but still melted in your mouth. The french fries were thick-cut and seasoned with kosher salt, pretty solid but the side of ranch dressing I got was sub-par. 

On my next visit I had a cheese-steak hoagie. This thing was massive, and the steak was juicy and tender despite the meat being lean and not fatty. It was served on a nice sesame wheat bun. 

My dad had their matzo ball soup which is homemade and light and tasty, unlike allot of places where the matzo ball is dense and boring. He also had half of a Reuben and it was just as generous as the full-size sandwich except cut in half. Their corned-beef is excellent and not fatty or greasy like their other meats.   

On both visits the service was prompt and friendly and our drinks were kept refilled constantly. On the first visit our really new waiter made a couple goofs but fixed his errors quickly enough. 

The thing I like the most about this place is that it beats the crap out of Chompie's (another popular \"Jewish\" deli/diner), in my opinion. I've been going to Chompie's for many, many years and we have almost always had bad, painstakingly slow service and borderline rude wait-staff. You would think they would fix it but our complaints have always fallen on deaf-ears.  I can walk into Archie's and get immediately waited on, then have yummy food in under 15 minutes. 

They also have tons of home-made and imported baked goodies. I can attest that they brownie was pretty awesome. I want to try their breakfast and their bagels which are imported from NY apparently. 

Very, very solid place, almost perfect, the food is great but the decor and tables could use updating, the new wait-staff will get better over time as well I'm sure."}
{"text":"A good deli. Not kosher and not NY, but the food is good. The sandwich's are real Deli size and the pickles, fries & sides are good. Service is a bit slow, and the food is as well. They have a full bar and an outside patio. A good place for a relaxing lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I liked the other location better but I am glad they are still in existence.  I like that this is not a chain and this is definitely the place to get a good lox and bagel."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. This was our first visit to Archie's Deli and the food was fantastic. There were four in our party. Items we ordered: Archie's Reuben (two of us), J.P. Pastrami Special - which consists of 
Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, oven-roasted onions & yellow mustard on grilled rye bread, Go Fish -which consists of 
Smoked salmon, tomato & onion on rye bread. The sandwiches are very large.   Our food server informed us they are made with a half pound of meat.  Sides, which were included, consisted of a choice of potato salad, coleslaw, fries or chips.  The potato salad was great.  I didn't like the coleslaw too much.   We also got a couple of desserts to takeout: the New York Cheesecake and Chocolate Eclair. The cheesecake is the way to go. Great flavor and not too sweet. Service was fine. Food server could answer all of our questions. The complimentary pickles were a little too salty (even though pickles are naturally salty) these were a little too much. The only reason for four stars is due to the condiment bottles placed on the table looked really dirty. I would eat here again though."}
{"text":"Archie's isn't a particularly bad restaurant to eat in, but with the high competition in the area, there are better places.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger, which to me, is the hardest burger to make, and like many other restaurants, Archie's too failed in their attempts.  The mushrooms were slimy as if they were fresh from a can, and even worse, Archie's did not even bother to sautee the mushrooms before placing it inside the burger.  Furthermore, the cook does not know the difference between medium rare and well done.  I sent my burger back for being overcooked, and when returned, I got another well done pattie.  I'm guessing Archie's has a container full of pre-cooked patties ready to send out.  At least the server and seating was clean, roomy, and comfortable."}
{"text":"Went for corned beef sandwich.  Not a typical deli; Is a sit down restaurant without a \"deli counter\".  I expected a corned beef sandwich cut from a warm brisket.  What I got was a pile of sliced corned beef loaf heated in a micro on a decent rye with avg yellow mustard.  I could have got at my nearest Safeway.  At $12 which included a tiny cup of potato salad and some pickle spears, very overpriced for that type of sandwich.  Guess you really have to go to east side to get a good corned beef."}
{"text":"Stale bread, WAYYYYYYY to expensive for what they are really offering.  If you want an expensive Jewish Deli, go to Chompies.  At least their pickles and food are good!  I have been to Archie's 3 times, apparently because I am a glutton for punishment and they are close to my work...  Over and over again, too expensive, not fresh or flavorful, and this time we even had a poor waitress.  Poor girl, probably couldn't get behind the terrible and overpriced food..."}
{"text":"Breakfast was fine and economical.  I had the two egg special with Ham and an English muffin. Muffin was a little old dry.  It was fine but not easy to wrong.  Coffee was great but the creamer packs included some empties. Thought that was a miss but maybe it  too early to catch empties. We've been to Archie's about 5 times at both the old and new locations. It's always been a little better than OK.  We like to support local restaurants and Archie's kept us coming back. But whoa; after breakfast made a quick stop at their restrooms.  Men's room was not even close to clean with tissues in shoved  in all facilities and no paper towels or hand dryers and no hand soap. My partner reported an equally distressing condition in the Women's room also without hand cleaning facilities.  So the huge question we have is where do their food prep folks wash up after they visit the restroom?  Sadly we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews on this board, but I enjoyed my food and my server was beyond excellent. I had a barbecued brisket sandwich on rye with coleslaw on the sandwich. I also had some Latkes which were cooked perfectly. Iced tea was constantly refilled. I do agree with other reviewers that t was all a buck or two more than I would like to spend on a sandwich. And the atmosphere was a little sanitized as well... a little too cold, or open-air, or something. But the menu is pretty extensive and you can find pretty much anything you're hankerin' for."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my fiance and mother in law and the food and service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  It is very casual and clean.  We had a good time and will visiting again soon."}
{"text":"The best sandwich in the world? No, but a welcomed change of pace in Surprise.

As the other reviewer's have mentioned the sandwiches are huge and expensive all at the same time. The corn beef was lean though, which is a HUGE positive in my book. The menu is a little overwhelming with all of the choices for sandwiches, but lacks in the side dish category for me. The side salad was limp and not being a fan of cole slaw I didn't really have another option. The husband and I split a huge red velvet cupcake for dessert and while the cake itself was a tad dry the frosting was amazing."}
{"text":"I found Archies far better then the big name deli in town (chompies)
great food and help
If you try it once ,you will come back for more"}
{"text":"Love it. Massive portions of delicious food, good coffee, great service. Being a Brit, and new to the area, I was surprised to find a Breakfast eatery with a 'Jewish twist'. I used to eat up in Golders Green in London, and this place would fit right in!

I can recommend the chilli omlette, which comes with home fries to! Good Luck walking out without feeling utterly stuffed after that!"}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time when they were at the old location on Litchfield and Bell and the food was spectacular. Since the move, the food quality and service has gone downhill. I honestly wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Still loving the sandwiches, but I'm really not happy with the slice of lemon cake we brought home Friday... Overbaking a butter cake and sticking some lemon curd between the layers doesn't make it delicious as several employees claimed... Did they try it? I think not, if they had, delicious wasn't an applicable word... Let's try dry, hard, unpleasant... I did like the frosting, but it wasn't lemon either... The main man summed it up when he said \"I get it, they needed to get rid of it and we fell for the marketing.\"

Be forewarned Archie's, I will be in tomorrow night to talk about this... The cakes are having technical and quality issues that need fixing..."}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan so far. Had a breakfast burrito here and it was really good it was bacon potato egg and cheese. The portion was filling the taste was delicious. I know it seems plain. But you can tell bacon was good quality. You had breakfast in every bite. You know what I mean you get a burrito and you don't get bacon until the end or it has two pieces of potato and all egg or even when the cheese is not evenly distributed. You so t get that with this burrito.  Now I understand it is a deli so I plan on trying deli style sandwiches in future. The menu is packed of goodies I don't even know what to start with. I will not forget to tell you about the fresh baked goods the have in their display. Please take a good look at that when you visit. There is a sweet for everyone. The staff is friendly I did pick up so I did not have opportunity to dine there. One day I will let you know how that goes. There are daily lunch specials so that's nice to know. Prices are a bit higher but from what I hear it is worth it. I believe in good quality and that's what happens with good stuff.  I say give Archies a chance I will be going again. Thanks Angela for introducing me to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"This place has moved farther west on Bell toward Reems road and it is still awesome!"}
{"text":"Recently went to breakfast at Archie's. Should have known it wasn't good when on a Sunday morning it was empty. The first 5 minutes, I liked the place. After we ordered, it was all down hill. After 40 minutes waiting on an easy breakfast order they finally started to bring the food. My wife's eggs Benedict was hideous. Eggs were hard, and the sauce was dried up. My daughter got half of her order and I got half of mine. When the bisqiuts and gravy finally showed up it was ice cold. My toasted bagel was hard and cold. How can you bring 3 people their breakfast at different times? When I asked the server why this is happening, she just shrugged and said \" I don't know\" She didn't care 1 bit. I asked her how she would feel if this happen to her. No reply at all. There was no \"sorry\" or compensation on the bill. I really wanted to leave no tip on a $36 bill but I left $5. Little did she know, I usually would have left her $10. I will never return and will never recommend Archie's to anyone."}
{"text":"YOU SHOULD REALLY READ THIS. The challenge with Archies is always the same,the service. We have been eating here for almost a year, and you probably wonder why we kept coming back, simple the food is good. The lesson I have learned though is DO NOT sit on the patio, the service is impersonal, they cannot manage tables and there seems to be no logic to who handles what tables. We consistently have the same server on the patio, and we do know that the service will always be lacking when seated in her area.

Today, on Mothers Day I might add, I decided to say something to the manager. Instead of apologizing to me as a returning patron the conversation went like this

Me: I just wanted to tell you out of courtesy that today we are going to have to post a negative review on Yelp about our service.
Manager: Well, do what you have to do, you'll be like everyone else in this town.
Me: (chuckle) well, I don't know that this would be the best approach to what I'm saying to you. Perhaps an apology,or next time we will make sure you get a different server.
Manager: Well, as a local businessman trying to run a business the negative reviews hurt my business, and you aren't helping. I'd rather not have the business, in fact you know what, don't come back here. You are not welcome at my restaurant, please do not ever return here. Now leave.

This is the WORST attitude I have ever seen in my life and a horrible representation of how a customer experience should be, let alone how you treat someone who spends money in your business."}
{"text":"You gotta try this!!! Food was delicious, burgers juicy, fish was fresh and cheesecake was decadent. I watched other guests receive their food, the sandwiches are HUGE. Our server was fun and attentive. Surprised the bill was low given the quality of the meal. Seriously... Try this place."}
{"text":"Good Food, Slow Service. 
If you're in a hurry, go somewhere else. If you're okay to wait and want something yummy, this is your spot."}
{"text":"We just got thrown out of Archie's Deli in Surprise, AZ. What was our horrific crime? Ordering an off-the-menu appetizer, one that my husband has ordered there, and received, at least five times. 

Today, the manager refused to do it, saying we would put him out of business if he let everyone order to-go food and eat it in the restaurant. Everyone who? It was mid-afternoon and the place was empty. We told him we would happily pay for the forbidden item (half a pound of hot tongue with a slice of challah), as we always did, but he blew up and told us to get out!

We are clean-cut, polite adult customers who typically spend $60 every time we go to Archie's. We tip well, love the food, have a good rapport with the staff, and never cause a problem there. This was probably our tenth visit to Archie's, and that manager has seen us before. 

Thanks to his nasty attitude today, we won't be back, and that's a shame. Archie's has a nice selection of sandwiches, great latkes, and a wonderful selection of classic deli beverages. The sandwiches are big enough to share, but we always buy two and take leftovers home. 

It's unfortunate that this manager didn't have the smarts to sell my husband his tongue and bread--even at a markup. Now he lost our business. $60 every other week adds up, Archie's. In this economy, isn't customer retention important?

Think long and hard before you spend your hard earned money and time here. We won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"I can't believe how hard it is to find a great Jewish Deli in the metropolitan Phoenix area....the selection is few and what we do have is mediocre at best. So I am sad to say that if I want an almost great Jewish Deli I have to drive all the way to Surprise... 

Archie's Deli offers probably the best yet in Delicatessen cuisine. They offer the right kind of sandwiches and even has blitzes, kugle, potato latkes, and knishes that aren't half bad. I was impressed with their Bagel selection (and more than happy that they weren't like Einstein bagels...pure bread) I even liked their pickle tray... 

But I have to say that there were a few negatives...First of all (and I am really not cheap, I swear) their prices are outrageous....I asked how much a fruit tray was for about 8-10 people and they quoted me $35. I couldn't believe that my brisket sandwich was $11...and it didn't even come with fries! I was offered cole slaw or potato salad...and since I don't like potato salad, I had to get cole slaw, even though my sandwich already had cole slaw on it. And in regards to the sandwich it was good and all...but since when did Challah become the shape of a hoagie bun? And to top it all off, our server didn't know the first thing about the menu or deli in general. And I did find it funny that my grandma had to get the manager over to let them know that they potato latkes needed more onion salt in them. 

I think with a few tweeks, Archies can be awesome. But they do cater to their clientele just fine and it seems like they are always busy. I will be back I am sure with my grandparents :-)"}
{"text":"Great Jewish style deli, complete with huge sandwiches, awesome desserts and big bowls of matzo ball soup"}
{"text":"I'd give this restaurant a solid 3.5 stars, but couldn't reach 4 in my opinion.  The place is good, however I can't see any wow factor making it completely standing out from the rest.  

The food is really good as it's a place for sandwiches and soups.  Portions are quite large and the prices are relatively high for the type of restaurant it is.  $10 to $12 for the typical sandwich I feel is quite high for here.  Maybe things are more expensive here because the place is so large and the rent is higher, I don't know.

When I think of a deli I imagine walking up to a counter and ordering.  Not here, strangely it's a sit down restaurant with a server taking your order.   Just seems odd as the seating looks similar to a cafeteria.  Maybe it's me, but I like to watch my sandwich being made in front of me at this type of place.

The best surprise I think here is the wonderful selection of desserts.  They all look so good behind the counter, decent portions, and fairly priced.  Pretty hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out after driving by it everyday on the way to work. When I pulled up I could see signs on the door stating they have closed, I assume for good.  Odd since I checked out their website before visiting and it gives no indication that the Tempe location is closed, I wonder if the other location is done for also?  I called their number on my cell phone and it came back as disconnected.  I'll notify yelp next."}
{"text":"Best NYC/Jewish-style food I have had in AZ."}
{"text":"Archie's started in Surprise in 2006, and just recently opened this location back in October. After hearing positive comments about this place from a co-worker, we gathered the troops and headed over there yesterday to give them a test drive.

The Tempe location is essentially an old Village Inn restaurant that they appear to be converting into a deli. We arrived unannounced with a party of 8 and the staff was quick to push some tables together to accommodate our group.

The staff here is friendly and the service was good. Once we got settled, our server put some pickles out on the table to snack on while she took our drink orders.

The menu options here are limitless...we had a hard time making a choice. I finally settled on Dutchy's Pastrami Deluxe - which just about put me into a culinary coma. I have not had a sandwich this good in a long time. If you are a Miracle Mile/Carnegie Deli fan, then this place is for you. The size of the sandwiches are HUGE, so unless you walk in with a big appetite, I highly suggest you order a half-sandwich unless you plan on bringing part of your lunch home in a box. I had to laugh when I saw an option on the menu to double the meat for an additional $4.50 - I don't know who could possibly put down that amount of food (unless you were attempting to imitate an episode of Man vs. Food).

The pastrami was perfectly seasoned/cooked and the bread was very fresh. You get your choice of fries or potato salad as a side - both of which received kudos from our party.

Afterwards, the manager stopped by to ensure everything was good and our server was kind enough to break our checks out individually (which she offered to do upfront without us asking).

I will be honest - I'm somewhat picky when it comes to deli's. Jason's for me is okay, but nothing special. I can make a comparable sandwich at home, so there is nothing unique to draw me there. Gandolfo's NY Deli has also left me unimpressed.

I would highly recommend Archie's to anyone for some excellent NY deli-style sandwiches...just bring a big appetite with you. Move over, Chompies...you have some competition."}
{"text":"Today a couple of coworkers and I decided to dine at Archies, one of which had never been there before. Because the sandwich I got the first time was so good, I figured hey, let's go to Archies and I'll get a half of a sandwich and you can tell me what you think.  

If you've been to Archies, you know the whole sandwiches are large and very tasty. You can read my first review for the details on that. However, if you're in the mood to save 3 or 4 bucks, or aren't entirely hungry for a giant sandwich, I suggest you head to paradise bakery or pretty much anywhere else if all you're looking for is a half. You'll see why below.

The menu selection for a half a sandwich and a side was considerably smaller than the regular sandwiches, and they come with fries or coleslaw etc... The prices range from $6-7.5, which isn't too bad.  

However, this is where the bad comes in. We all ordered half sandwiches: ham, turkey, and pastrami. When we received the sandwiches we all had the OK...  :-\ sad face look. The sandwich was nothing but some slices of meat in between two pieces of rye bread. They didn't come with any condiments at all, no cheese, no lettuce, no tomatoes or mayonnaise, nothing. Nor were we offered any condiments. I don't know if it's the fault of the waitress for not asking us what we wanted on our sandwiches (or our fault for assuming a sandwich would come with condiments), or if they just don't offer it, but that's something that's kind of important for a sandwich, otherwise it's not even a sandwich, it's bread and meat, like a giant size lunchable served with fries. Nor were we given the choice of bread type. I don't know if you've tried it, but Ham on Rye isn't exactly the best combo. Besides the apparent lack of variety, the bread seemed freshly baked, but was rather chewy and the crust was near inedible due to the sheer amount of force required to rip it. I felt like a little kid eating inside the crust lines of a pb and j sandwich (with more of a wince than the smile you get from the sweetness of jelly). 

Sadly, I get the feeling that the half sandwich menu is designed to make you think you're getting a deal, however, it's designed to be the highest profit margin section of the sandwich menu with no expensive extras like cheese or vegetables on the sandwich. Until this place offers half of a \"true\" sandwich, I won't be coming back. The sad excuse for a sandwich was not a good first impression for my other co worker, and I doubt he'll stop by again any time soon. 

Unless you're catering to the senior crowd with no taste buds, your second half of your sandwich menu needs an overhaul. Step it up Archies, your new location is in a deserted shopping center, and I'd hate to see you be just another mark on the hit list of struggling/soon to be closing mom and pop shops."}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive. Three steak hoagies... $41.09!  When I got them home there was hardly any meat inside, it was like eating a salad sandwich. It also took 40 minutes to make my to go order.

The saving grace for this place is the chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"This deli is only mediocre. Their menu prices seem a little too high for the quality of food and service. I doubt if I will return."}
{"text":"So... it's been just over two years that I've been here and due to my wife having a constant \"give people a chance to redeem themselves\" attitude I did just that.  We walked in on a Saturday around brunch time and they weren't too busy so we were seating quickly.  Our server shall remain nameless but she was extremely rude and almost seemed put off that she had more people to serve than she wanted.  I asked (just as before) if the meat was made in house or brought in from a service she immediately told me it was brought in and even told me the name of the company that prepares it.  I can't help but remember the email I got from the owner stating all the meats were made in house and asked me to come back for a tasting.  Any way...  The meat was terrible again! Not greasy as before but slimy as heck and that made the bread very soggy so I took the meat off to try it alone and it was too bad to eat so I called the waitress over and as I was explaining what was wrong she grabbed my plate and walked away.  I said \"excuse me I wasn't done talking.\"  Without turning around she said I will just take it off.   Again the food and service are absolutely deplorable."}
{"text":"We had 2 scoops of egg salad w/ crackers as our appetizer. It was great and the texture was spot on. Next time I'll ask for more lettuce to make mini wraps. This is not on the menu so you have to ask. We had a rueben and a Dinty Moore w/ horseradish. Both were huge!!! The meat is super tender and very flavorful. We will be back to try something from the all day breakfast menu. Staff are super nice and very accommodating.  Good job."}
{"text":"First time we ate there (a week after they opened), customers, servers and the owner (I think) were staring at us like they've never before seen a Filipino family.

Anyway, we've eaten there a few more times and I have to say that their food was good. I love the brisket dinner especially the latke, my wife their pastrami sandwich. 

I took my parents there one evening and I told my dad to ask for the brisket dinner. Unfortunately, they were out. So, that's the only complaint I have. 

A good place to eat. Try it."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. We've become regulars and we are never disappointed, especially with the service. Anna and Summer are the best. Love their bagel chips and ranch. Their fish fry on Fridays is the best we've had in AZ. So far, all the food that we've had, has been great. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my go to places. It now is not!! After hiking with a few of my friends I told them about this place and told them how good it was. We showed up at noon and they were really busy. So we decided to get our food to go. Paid for it and waited outside. No problem. Went back in after about 20 minutes or so. Was told that the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 15-20! I said we have already waited that long. They apologized and said they were really busy. Waited again then went back in. There was an older couple waiting and they were wondering if there was another place close, I told them about New York breakfast up the street and how good it was. So they left. Then a woman and her two kids came in was not greeted and she waited. So then a older gentleman came in behind her and he was greeted by the two guys that were folding silverware and handed him a menu!! The lady said screw this and she left! So now I'm getting upset and asked to speak to who was in charge. His name is Rick. I asked 4 people to speak to him and one of friends did too. He never came out! They bring my friends food but not mine. Still waiting. Finally I said I want my money back. They were ok with this but never took my card or anything. Then one of the kids I was talking too cone outs and says never come back and that I needed to leave. I told him go the fuck away. Which I never should have said but was very upset at this point. I had no problem leaving or coming back but wanted my money back. So THEN this woman comes out and starts telling me not yell at her staff which I wasn't I was trying to get my money back and explain that they were loosing customers and nobody wanted to listen or care! She told me I needed to respect her and told her it should go both ways. So finally Rick comes out and tells me not to swear at his staff which I only did to one. I know was wrong. He finally took my card and refunded my money. And to top this all off this was in front of his customers and one guy said not good business. I work in n retail and know how to treat people.  And this is not the way!!! They deserve 0 stars!! Which is really too bad because they do have good food."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Goodyear, and we decided to drive up and check out Archie's on the recommendation of a friend.  We have lived in the Valley for about 3 years, and I have become a fan of The Downtown Deli in downtown Phoenix, which was actually the first corned beef and pastrami I had ever had.

To me, this place was ok, but in comparison to Downtown Deli, it was quite lacking in value and taste.  I got a Double Jeopardy on an onion roll, which is corned beef, pastrami, hot and regular mustard, as well as swiss and muenster cheese.

Upon taking the first bite, I knew something was missing.  The taste just didn't seem to be there.  I couldn't taste much mustard at all (there was very little on the sandwich), and the meet was not as I have become a fan of.  I am used to good corned beef and pastrami melting in your mouth, and this definitely did not do that.  Even after putting the Hebrew National deli mustard on the sandwich, it seemed a bit bland.

Now, I'm saying it was \"bad\" necessarily, maybe I have become spoiled by Downtown Deli.  But for the $35 we spent (just meals for my wife and I plus tip, the kids eat free after 4), I wasn't impressed.  I think the pricing was a little bit much, $2-3 cheaper would have been more reasonable.  Especially with the quantity of the sides.  We both got potato salad, and is was served in a small plastic cup like you would get your fruit in at and elementary school (see the picture of the applesauce).  For $11.50 (for my sandwich), that's just not enough."}
{"text":"Very average.  Didn't like bagels. Too soft. Good lox. Coffee so-so.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"It's like our own Carnegie Deli in Surprise!  Bagels and lox?  Check!  More pastrami on a sandwich than any one human can eat in a sitting?  Check!  Bialys? Knishes?  Corned beef?  Check, check, check!

If you love a New York deli, but hate freezing your arse off, Archie's is for you!"}
{"text":"I am tossed on this place.  I love the fish Fridays that are on special.   Huge menu and it's tough to tell what's going to be good.  Mostly older folks here and the service is generally super slow.  I love the cold cut sandwiches though.  If they worked on some things this place could be a home run."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here, they pile on the meat! The pastrami is lean, Iv never had a gross fatty piece. My favorite place to go for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast on Sunday with my Mom and Aunt.  The food was excellent!! I loved the fresh taste of the food and the service was wonderful.  Cant wait to go again."}
{"text":"We stop in occasionally to get sandwiches. They're very good but in general I think they are pretty overpriced."}
{"text":"I had matzo ball soup which was very good and the waitress was excellent. So why so few stars? In one word, management. 

I went with a group of 16 - Archie's had been called twice regarding the reservation. Yesterday to confirm. When we got there, we were informed by the manager in an extremely rude way that he had not talked to us and they never take reservations. We could be seated at various tables throughout the restaurant, but not necessarily near each other. The manager continued to argue loudly that we were wrong, we never had a reservation, he accused us of trying to run the restaurant, etc., etc. (There were numerous empty table toward the back, no, we could not use those tables.)

Based SOLELY on the rudeness of the manager, I will NEVER return. He could have at least come over and said something about \"sorry for the miscommunication\", instead he came over and said that the person who had called had never called. Manager is jut too much of a jerk to want to return.

HORRENDOUS FOR GROUPS - NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GO THERE AS A GROUP. NEVER."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been to Archie's three or four times over the years. My first experience was TERRIBLE. The manager was extremely rude and obnoxious and I swore never to go back. A year or so goes by, I do go back, at someone else's urging.  That manager not seen and the food is pretty good. Since Archie's opened and moved, I've been four or five times. 

Other than the first experience, service has been great and the food good. Chicken in a pot was really good - remember that some two years later. I had liver and onions Saturday night. It was good. My recommendation is halve the meat and potatoes and add some veggies. Still, it was good. Maybe I should go back more often than once a year or so. Service was friendly, attentive and great."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and although the food was very good the service we received when we first walked in by the hostess was awful. It was like we were an inconvenience by being there and her actually having to work, after that in counter with her I really expected the worse however our server was great and the food was super fast coming out."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious sandwiches worth multiple return visits.

My husband found this place and took me here for a Sunday lunch. I will be returning in the future and suggested it as a great carry out dinner solution even.

The food: They bring you complimentary pickles which include pickled green tomatoes. Those were my favorite. These are homemade and gotta try! We both ordered sandwiches from pages and pages of different and creatively named choices. They definitely pile on the meat, cheese, toppings, spreads. These are huge. The only negative is the sides are typical deli/bbq sides such as macaroni salad, potato salad, fries... Not sure what I would have wanted but you can't eat a whole sandwich and the side. The fries were shortened steak fries, so short and thick. They had a lot of visible pepper on them but I really couldn't taste any salt. They were crispy and good. The macaroni salad was okay, lots of extras in it.

Customer service: We were seated right away and our waitress kept our glasses full. She took some time bringing the check at the end but was cheerful.

Final note: Archie's draws an older crowd so be patient when they do not realize they are blocking the entrance. The entrance isn't that big for larger groups to arrive and actually fit in the restaurant. 

I would go back and would love to try breakfast sometime too!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are tasty! The portions are huge, fries are delish and the service is pretty good. The counter display in the front is a little sad but everything else was great. This is a great place for me because its close by and quick. No more fast food junk. Yay! Be sure to mention yelp and get half off a second full sandwich. :D"}
{"text":"A friend recently went into Archie's new location and confirmed that my opinion about the same rude-jerk owner! She asked about making arrangements to have a group lunch there.  The owner interrupted her and said they are not interested in hosting groups there (and lost my friend's business)."}
{"text":"Great place!  Not even a terrible wait on a Sunday morning!  Egg and onion cram me was delicious, I love their home fries.  Decent service for how busy they were.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love me some \"Jewish soul food\" and there's nothing like a New York style deli to give me a fully tummy all day. Archie's is an excellent choice if you're looking for a massive pile of corned beef or pastrami on rye bread with Swiss cheese and Russian dressing. Let the waitress bring you the pickles because they're just awesome!

Service was a little slow today - I think the hostess seated us in a section that wasn't being watched, but once another waitress noticed that we'd been there for a bit, things improved. She comped our drinks.

I have read the reviews and seen how great their Reubens are, but I thought I might go just a little healthier. My eye found the \"Berman's Sure Choice\" which is the same thing as a Reuben except it's not grilled. I was very pleased with my choice. My tablemates enjoyed the pancakes and the Challah French Toast.

If you're anywhere near Surprise, absolutely go here. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing dinner in a Vistancia Deli my wife and I were in search of a good Deli meal.  Archies delivered - the Matza ball soup was spot on as was the Corned beef sandwich.  The matza ball was a good consistency and the soup was hot, flavorful and full of veggies.   The Corned beef sandwich was melt in your mouth good - although I originally wanted a Pastrami sandwich and was told they could not serve it extra lean.   Desert was an eclair - home made - very creamy inside although not as fresh as I would have liked.   The Deli was packed for their Friday night fish fry.   If your in the area it's worth a stop - I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great new location. I am excited they moved closer to us. Always the best sandwiches in Surprise."}
{"text":"So sad it is closed!  What happened?  Went here often.  Best deli sandwiches and pickles going.  Service not always the best, but food was fabulous."}
{"text":"The good- I've finally found a real Jewish deli in Arizona.  Coming from California I was spoiled by the Katella Deli.  The food was great with great variety.

The bad- I got a Yelp coupon for 10% off and the waitress forgot to apply it.  Then when I asked her to fix it and add a cupcake to go, she still forgot to apply it.

Overall- well worth it if you're jonesing for generous sandwiches."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much, but the service is awful.  I have to say the food is pretty good but there is no reason to wait 10 min. For drinks. 
I've been to archies numerous times hoping that it would change, but no. 4 women in charge of serving restaurant and I've witnessed a couple come in and wait to be seated for 3 to 4 min. And end up seating themselves.  We never received our appetizer of hummus and my drink was too strong. I don't feel we were the only ones that were feeling like this. When you looked around people who had come in and been seated were still waiting like we had for drinks. I don't understand how a place with 15 tables has such a hard time. Okay, you have a bar area but that wasn't busy. There is no reason with a staff of 4 that you cannot keep up. No napkins at the table, ketchup was empty. Get on that shit. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't go back, but I know I will. I guess I'm just disappointed.  Good food, shit service."}
{"text":"Now that's a sandwich! 

That's all I have to say, but Yelp is making me write words, words, words to fill the page."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for lunch on a Sunday.  The Pastrami was awesome.  I believe this is one a a few different locations for Archies.  I'll be back......and I'll probably have the Pastrami again (that's how I roll)."}
{"text":"I was on the west side for business and this place was recommended to me for lunch.  I love a good Reuben and got the Brooklyn. Reuben.  This was a sandwich.  plenty of meat and huge.  Reminded me of a good deli ssandwich. from back east.  The homemade pickles were great.  I wish this place was closer to where I lived I'd definitely go back.  If I'm. ever over that way again I'll be stopping in."}
