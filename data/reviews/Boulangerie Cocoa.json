{"text":"Absolutely beautiful bakery.  Must've cost a pretty penny-- every inch of this space has been thought of.. gorgeous floor-to-ceiling cabinetry in dark wood...   Live in the building above, so at the end of a walk with dog, stopped by and bought a slice of marble cheesecake.  Pure decadence- moist and ooh, so dense.     Has charming patio furniture, very European feel.    So happy to have a great bakery in the neighbourhood.  No more second rate cakes from Sobey's-- Hurray!!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with some of the pastries and savoury foods they serve, but was very disappointed with the service from the worker. An older lady with short blonde hair, very rude to a customer, I once overheard. I was sitting drinking their amazing Starbucks latte, and heard her rude chatter in Spanish to someone. Was a turn off really."}
{"text":"Had a tuna croissant and veggies crepe here for lunch today.  Food was declicious and excellent value.  Will definitely come back if I visit Humber Bay Park again.  Great pastries too.  Wish there is something like this near where we live."}
{"text":"A beautiful spot for enjoying a coffee and a lovely dessert.   Their treats are sumptuous, and range from a variety of cake slices (or full cakes to take out for a special occasion) at a reasonable price (~$3.99--most other places charge over $4 and sometimes over $5 for the equivalent). They also have petit fours, mousses and tiramisú among other gâteries.  They also serve breakfast pastries, like danishes, cinnamon and sticky buns and bagels. The sticky buns are gigantic, dripping with nuts and very sticky indeed (you can practically taste the honey in them). Lunch items include quiches, salads, panini and mushroom or seafood au vent--which I saw there for the first time today. Sadly, I had already eaten lunch, so didn't get a chance to try the latter two, but vol au vent is a favourite dish of mine, so I look forward to getting back here soon to try their versions!  The interior of the cafe is lovely, with warm lighting and European-style décor--the kind of interior you wouldn't be surprised to encounter in Paris or Budapest. I love coming by here to linger over some food or coffee. In the summer and into the early autumn, they have a patio area outside, with a view of the lake--perfect for sitting, reading and enjoying the ambiance. Weekends are better for the patio experience because there is construction right across the street, which can get a little loud during the week. But even then, it's still very pleasant sitting out.  The service has always been cheerful and friendly when I have gone--another big plus, in my eyes.  Definitely stop by for a visit, if you're enjoying the walking trails at Humber Bay park or the boardwalk along Marine Parade, just west of the city--it's a lovely spot!   A final note: They serve Starbucks' coffee, which may be a deal maker for some and a deal breaker for others. But this place is absolutely worth the visit! If you don't like Starby's then have a tea, or just some dessert!"}
{"text":"Attempted going 3 times and their website does not properly reflect their real hours of operations, so am not commenting on their foods/drinks...yet  On the basis that they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner items, as well the fact they are a cafe in a residential area, they should give strong consideration of extending their hours to stay open until 8:30P Mon-Wed, perhaps until 10:30P on Thursdays and until 2A on Fridays/Saturdays.      Especially with the summer months ahead, this would attract more regular clientele from the immediate and surrounding areas, who would like to enjoy a cafe & dolce, after dinner at home or at a friends, as well as after an end of week evening outing.      Their current business hours are very limiting for them and potential clientele.  Thanks for the consideration Cocoa Patisserie Boulangerie management!

{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. Every time, other than today I have had one of their sandwiches which were decent. A little pricey but ok. Today I went in with my mom and ordered from their all day brunch menu. We both ordered eggs Benedict. Wow! They were awful!! Like un-eatable. As I sit here and write this review I'm on the verge of throwing up. The eggs were hard cooked and the bacon was burnt. The potatoes were cold and stale and the fruit looked like it was sitting around cut in peaces for like a week. I'm thinking that everything was pre-cooked and the girls did a horrible job reheating. Absolutely gross. Also the hollandaise sauce tasted like mayo. I will never ever go back."}
{"text":"The pace is under a new owner, and it has been changed in a very bad direction. The quality of food dropped significantly. They used to MAKE crepes, but now all crepes PRE-MADE. We ordered crepes with chicken  . The girl just reheated the crepes , and put inside dry chicken. The taste was stale and awful. After she made crepes for us,she started to swipe the floor all over the place - dust was coming to our plates - what a mess!  We live close by and we pretty often had coffee over there, not anymore.  --"}
{"text":"Very hit or miss.  Sandwich was supposed to be hot and had a cold sauce on top.   They microwave things there.   Coffee was old- not fresh-  last time I was there and the owners wife rudely denied that and then gave me less than what I paid for the coffee as a refund.   Lentil soup is good tho! Owner is nice.  They close earlier than the posted time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but the owner is seriously rude to customers. Pastries are not baked daily, look one week old. They serve no frills quality Starbucks coffee. Don't waste your money in poor quality and customer service."}
{"text":"A convenient spot to grab a bite and coffee. This place has a lot of potential.  However, it seems a bit disorganized.  It might just be the placement of the furniture, but there's something that kind of feels ... awkward.  Like you showed up and the tables were set up last minute for people to sit.  The food is good!  But it's not the most comfortable or ambient cafe I've visited."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, AMAZING crepes (just had the tuna and cheese crepe) and cute desserts. Friendly staff and dog friendly (there are bowls of water outside)."}
{"text":"Terrible! Went for breakfast thinking that it is virtually impossible to screw up eggs and bacon. Well... I ordered the \"Canadian Breakfast\" which was described as Eggs, Bacon, Fresh Fruit, Potatoes and Fresh Baked Bread. Simple enough, right? Well, I got greasy eggs, 4 pieces of the fattiest bacon I've even seen, 1 strawberry and 1 cube a cantaloupe, a defrosted hash-brown and a piece of toast. The owner seemed charming and the baked goods looked appetizing, but based on my first experience, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great view looking on to the lakeshore ! They also function as a Starbucks, we had their vanilla latte and mocha ! Exactly like I get it from Starbucks, cups and all with same prices. And they have amazing and cheap gelato.. the pistachio gelato was to die for ! I recommend sitting outside. Not the greatest interior. Service was decent although they could be more welcoming. Overall because of the Starbucks drinks, gelato and the view they have to offer I would visit again. I have not tried their food."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have noted, the space is lovely, warm and inviting. The display cases feature great looking treats.  If only the food tasted as good as it looks.  I tried a macaron last week and it left a lot to be desired. I really wanted t like this place as the location is wonderful.   As the patisserie offers breakfast, we went back and ordered waffles and french toast.  Portions are huge and service was quick and friendly, but the french toast was heavy and the waffles tasted like cornflakes."}
{"text":"My friend told me it's decent and I decided to try the napoleon.  It was disappointing. Looks good but it was very soggy. My friend had a cherry cake and it was pretty good. Overall I'd stop in again if I needed a break but not for the desserts. Can't say I tried the food."}
{"text":"This cafe has been hit or miss for me. To be fair, I've only been there twice. The first time was an unexpected hit, the second time was a clear miss. Both of my pastries were totally rock hard and stale. It was the end of the day, yes, but I felt like I got ripped off paying full price for clearly dried up old pastries. I'm of the opinion that pastries in that condition shouldn't even be sold, unless they're being cleared out as 'day-olds'. Meh."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because it's a little too pricey for what u get. I bought a sandwich and a coffee and I payed 17$ ...they use Starbucks coffee if that's what you like. I don't think I'll be going back for lunch any time soon."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and always delicious. They went out of their way to cater to dietary restrictions and even called the baker on the phone to find out if an item included dairy when we asked. Some signage would be helpful to direct the flow of traffic."}
{"text":"Cocoa serves Starbucks coffee, had a nice cup of Pike Place and a great conversation. The cafe is beautifully designed with subway tile, mosaic tile floors and dark panels on the walls. I have not tried the food yet, but it was a great place to meet with someone."}
{"text":"Worst scone I've ever had and that's sad. They microwaved it without me asking. It was crap to begin with. Heating only made it worse. Get rid of the bad pastries if you want to be legit!"}
{"text":"Service isn't great but the location is if you're in the area. Small but comfortable patio for groups of two. Seems to be a husband and wife pair that's running it or possibly a family so service is a bit slow. You have to go in to place your order and you also have to wait and bring it to your table.  My smoke salmon and cream cheese bagel was delicious but my tall latte was so so. They have all day brunch, savory and sweet crepes, sandwiches, gelato, French patisserie etc...  3/5 for service  4/5 for food  4/5 for ambience   Prices are good. Busy on summer weekends so small line ups.   Give it a shot"}
{"text":"We just tried to go on Sunday July 19. While I waited outside with our dog my wife went in to order. \"Where do I order?\" she asked one young lady who snarled \"Over There\" and promptly disappeared into the bathroom.  The unsmiling lady \"over there\" then proceeded to serve the people behind my wife who she knew. Very rude service. Will not go back.  Food looked mediocre.  LADY YOU ARE IN THE SERVICE WITH A SMILE BUSINESS.   IF YOU DON\"T LIKE DOING THAT THEN GO AWAY!"}
