{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because the stuffed peppers are amazing but the prices are outrageous for this area! Last week the price for 3 yes 3 stuffed peppers were I believe $7.50. Now they are $9 for the same amount ( I was hoping to at least get 4 peppers for 9 dollars!!))  and that's not including any bread. All stuffed peppers always come with some sort of bread and they charged another $2 for that also. Zucchini was decent price and was OK for $7.50 but domestic bottle beer was $3 yes again too much! I asked the bartender why they raised prices on the food and her answer was that the owner is new to the restaurant business and wasn't making enough money but the alcohol prices remained the same whole the menu changed completely and the food prices. Well bottom line these prices are ridiculous for the amount of food u get and for our area ,(Clairton) , even though they are considered Jefferson I believe. #SorryNotSorry"}
{"text":"I have never given a review before, but our experiences at this restaurant have been so bad, I feel like I should say something for future customers. This was about the 3rd time we visited this place. The first two visits were okay, never impressive or satisfying. This time, my husband and I waited over an hour and half for our food. The place was not that busy. The customers who were there, were basically just hanging out. We placed our orders for a burger and a chicken sandwich- nothing complicated. We waited 45 minutes before the waitress came over to tell us our food would be out shortly. Another 15 minutes goes by and still nothing. She brings us over homemade chips and ranch dressing and apologizes and tells us, again, the food will be out shortly. Another 15 minutes or so goes by and still nothing. We finally receive our two sandwiches just to be disappointed again. The fries were cold and hard like they had been sitting out and our sandwiches were okay - not something you would wait an hour and half for. At this point, we were done with this place. We ate some of the sandwiches and asked for our check. We did let the waitress know it was not that good and the fries were cold and hard. She offered us dessert. We kindly said no. I was hoping she would accommodate us in some other way but no. We received the full check. My husband and I are not the type of people to complain. We paid and left her a decent tip. However, WE WILL NOT BE BACK. I work very hard for my money and do not want it wasted on a place like this."}
{"text":"Terrible. Chef rich is an asshole  falsely accused me of something I did not do and in front of customers. Also food  SUCKS BIG TIME my hoagie had unpeeled onions on it that were not cooked and the bread stale also fries were so greasy and flimsy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK !!!! EXCEPT TO TALK TO OWNER"}
{"text":"I love coming here for trivia night. My mother and my aunts and uncles and my family and I always come. My brother loves the games in the back corner. Unfortunately, I cannot give this place 5 stars whereas the service is slow."}
{"text":"Payne Hill is a place to go for good food, drinks and fun,  The 6$ lunch menu is unbeatable.  Huge fish sandwiches, hand cut fries, homemade chips-
Yum
Tony Janflone on a Sunday as well as other music groups- check the schedule.
If you are looking for fast food go to MD's.  This is good food and a great place to be with friends or maybe make a new one."}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews for this place. We've been there numerous times and always had a good experience. The food is good, standard bar food. There's a great drink selection. And the service is fantastic. The only negative I can see (and it's barely a negative) is that when there's a band playing, it gets loud. But... if you're at a bar/grill when a band is playing, it SHOULD be kinda loud."}
{"text":"When you have 90-110 minutes for dinner...

Saturday evening, we were advised by hostess that she could seat us but it would be about 10-20 minutes before we could place an order. We placed a drink order that took about 20 minutes to arrive. Dinners followed about 45 minutes later (about 80-90 minutes for two adult  and one child's dinners for to arrive). My Chicken Tortellini was good. Adequate portion for the $14.50  - my wife's $14 Chicken PHG (named after the restaurant) was maybe a single 4oz seasoned chicken breast and a minimum any accompanying else of with a small side of spaghetti. Soup or salad was also included.

Had it not been for the $12-off (enjoy/Entertainment) punch-card, it would have been a 2-star review.

They've been open about a year. I counted maybe 3 servers. Many empty seats. The hostess' warning that the kitchen was backed-up was absolutely true.,

Hostess was friendly/empathetic. Waitress was visited table to take order, deliver another drink, and serve dinner then the check. 

They have issues. Some potential, but some real logistical issues. I'll try again in 6mos or so to see if it's improved."}
{"text":"First it took over 10 minutes to get a drink. Never took that long before. Ordered open face pot roast, which I ate before, with gravy on everything including fries. The place wasn't very busy. The food was warm, not much gravy or meat, the bread was hard because not much gravy to soften it. The waitress did check so I did get more gravy. Service was ok, the food so so. I heard new owners took over, so I guess that's the difference. Another restaurant off my list."}
{"text":"Glad we stopped for lunch @ Payne Hill Grille. Happened to be driving by and decided to stop for lunch. Sat at bar and enjoyed a Spoonwood IPA and excellent cheese steak. Wife really enjoyed her 885 Chicken Salad and fried zucchini.  Service was friendly and attentive. This is a very nice local spot with surprisingly good food. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming the favorite lunch location for my co-workers and I. Try the the flat bread pizza for an excellent lunch."}
{"text":"Saw a $2.00 off coupon on LocalFlavor.Com for the Payne Hill Grill today.  I've driven past this place a number of times saying to myself,  \"I've got to try that place some day... \". Well I suppose \"some day\" is today.

First good sign was, with this being a Monday, the parking lot was pretty full. And if first impressions make lasting impressions, the Southern Tier Creme Brulee on tap bided well to that lasting impression. I sat at the bar, ordered a beer, glanced at the menu and decided to go with the chicken parm.

All in all my dinner was pretty much average. The salad came out very quickly, with 5 minutes.  The lettuce was a tiny bit wilted but it wasn't horrible. The chicken parm was placed in front of me 23 minutes after placing my order...  not terribly long but a little longer than I would have expected. 

The dish had a nice presentation to it with the green parsley flakes speckled on top of the white cheese and the red sauce peaking out from the edges. There was a generous amount of cheese on the chicken but the cut was very thin.  It tasted good but not \"knock your socks off\" good. The pasta side could have had more sauce and the sauce that was on it was rather bland.

The bill came to $17.38 plus tip after my $2.00 coupon was applied.  

The bartender who served me, Trish, was very nice and the regulars seemed to know her well.  Perhaps it was just the entree that I chose that made for an unimpressive dining experience but the beer sure made an impression!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of people to eat the other night. I had the worst restaurant experience ever. I felt bad for the wait staff but the place was not even somewhat busy and or group should not have caused as much of an issue as it did. Clearly they are not prepared for a busy night. We even called ahead and they got the reservations wrong. The manager was rude when we complained and actually said\" well we have been in busy for years so I guess most people are happy with us\". He then proceeded to go to the bar and talk about us to a customer at the bar. I will never step back in this place with the lack of respect shown to paying customers. The food wasn't even that good. It came cold and a third of the orders were not even correct."}
