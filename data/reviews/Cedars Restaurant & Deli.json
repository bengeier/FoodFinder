{"text":"Went for a quick lunch upon Yelp's recommendation. Yet another restaurant worth the buzz,  The place is Full during lunch hour, service line is very professional and fast. Their shawarma rap taste brilliant. Light, good texture, and delicious, and doesn't have that annoying strong garlic taste in their garlic sauce. Unfortunately I ordered to-go, so no pictures this time."}
{"text":"Whether you order beef, chicken donair or falafel, rest assured that the portion is generous not to mention the fabulous taste. The price is very reasonable, just over $6 for beef & $7+ for chicken donairs compare to $10+ in other restaurants. Staff/owners are very friendly too.  We get take out from here almost every week since my husband & I both love donairs. Will DEFINITELY RECOMMEND to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here during the week for lunch. Parking is very tight, not many spaces. It is located right off of Edmonton Trail.   The decor is simple, not a ton of places to sit during the lunch hour. However, the line went by very quickly.I got a medium size shawarma. It was very tasty! The staff is also very friendly so I give the service two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Cedars really is as good as it gets. If you're looking for a quick, healthy bite after work or catering for the office, Cedars always has a fresh selection with a taste unlike anywhere else in the city. The owners are fantastic and their staff always gives 110% in their service. I have been eating at Cedars for years and I've recently started ordering for office lunches which has been a huge hit. Try everything they have at least once, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Easily the best donair in Calgary! Great food, friendly guys."}
{"text":"Good place with good food. The staffs are nice. Orders  didn't take long at all to take and make. The mixed shawarma was amazing. There are lots of desserts to choose from, including a vast selection of baklavas.  Definite repeat!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, awesome beef donairs and baklavas, Great flavor and the device was exceptional!"}
{"text":"I'm officially addicted to their Baklava! They are from Heaven and I am very grateful. P.s. The blossoms are to die for"}
{"text":"Always fresh, consistent and probably the Best Schwarma in town.  I love coming here and go at least once a week."}
{"text":"MMMMMMM!!!!!!!  Best veitnemese subs in town!!!   So yummy :)"}
{"text":"We came to Cedars based on the reviews and type of food offered. It was delicious! The store front and washrooms were very clean. Staff were very friendly and efficient. We were at the back of a lengthy line (good sign) but it was very quick to get through.  I definitely recommend this place. Lots of great menu choices."}
{"text":"We've been fans of Cedars for many years.  At an open-house for 30 people, we purchased a mixture of beef donairs, chicken shawarmas and falafel pitas with an assorted tray and hummus, tzatziki and baba ghanoush.   Everything including the bakalava dessert was a hit with our guests.  The portions are large and the price is reasonable.   No only is the food excellent, the owner and his team of attentive staff offer truly amazing customer service.   Highly recommend Cedars!   10/10 every time."}
{"text":"Not the same quality chicken shawarmas as you would get from the Panorama location.  The veggies looked tired, and the taste was slightly off."}
{"text":"Great food! So fresh! Great atmosphere! Amazing people- They are so polite and kind and friendly! We order big lunches for our work crew and get free baklava. Wicked place to go and just enjoy a peaceful donair."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a quick meal or for catering trays. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Did a review recently but had to add a comment. Ordered lunch for 50 construction workers. Worked with Mohammad so we had exactly what they like to eat. I've been doing event planning for +20 years. I have rarely had so many people ask if they could take an extra plate home with them for later! Assorted donairs and pitas, fantastic extra dips, party mix of samosas, grape leaves, and spanakopita. Every plate was full as they went through the line and everyone was thrilled. Assortment of desserts were gone in seconds.   I was really happy with the price, because I'm not feeding 50 big appetites or under $15 anywhere else! Thank you Mohammad and the rest of the team at Cedars Restaurant & Deli.   Maureen"}
{"text":"Great falafel, amazing baclava. Cornerstone pita is your best bet, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We live just down the street and have been getting are Shwarma and other delicious homemade food from Cedars for years. Awesome food, very clean environment and great, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just went today. I work in the NE and my coworkers rave about this place. I finally decided it was time to check it out.   I loved it. I had one of the \"plates\" (the food was excellent but I don't think i'd have it again, i'd rather just have the pita wrap).  The food was cheap (but not cheap quality). They were also very quick and efficient.   I loved the outside patio, easy to grab a quick lunch.  I'll be going back soon to do some exploring of their menu."}
{"text":"the best donairs in the city. the best donairs im going to say it one last time  *loud commanding voice* the. best. donairs."}
{"text":"Ah Cedars....This was once a favourite hotspot for me and my coworkers when I worked for an online company that's changed it's name a dozen times. Tip: Getting into the habit of eating 6 of Cedar's Falafel balls and your permeating garlic smell will surely squash any chances you have @ an office romance!  Recently I decided to hit Cedar's again on a whim and craving for their Mediterranean goodness. Super friendly folks that will literally HOOK you up with the good stuff. Most donair and shawarma shops are like Vietnamese joints where the fare is starting to be average, but Cedar's is still a cut above. Fresh ingredients, well seasoned meats, and hefty servings. And I agree with everyone, the price is great and for a few dollars change, you can literally walk away with a Donair the size of Popeye's forearm :D"}
{"text":"All steamer kept and prepared by non ethnic workers.  The family has spread to thin to all 5 locations leaving the quality to go downhill.  The premade out of store products still have that lebanese quality but the rest is a far cry from tlwhat cedars deli started out as on 8th ave serving the best beef shwarama.  You wont find bewf shwarama anywhere at the edmonton  location"}
{"text":"So, I want to share with you my observation that there are falafel balls that are big and mushy on the inside and falafel balls that are smaller and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.   This place has the smaller, crispier falafels, which are delicious in a falafel sandwich brimming with pickled turnip, lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers and the sauce of your choice. I usually get tahini and tzatziki along with a squirt of hot sauce. I like mine hot!!! You can choose a regular or large size sandwich. The regular is perfect, especially if you add some tabbouleh salad and for dessert some baklava.   There's lots on the menu - beef donairs, chicken shawarmas, vine leaves, spinach phyllos - all those delicious things you're craving!"}
{"text":"Best donairs in the city. Very friendly staff. One of my favorite places in Calgary to eat. I dream about these donairs :)"}
{"text":"The Chicken Souvlaki Wrap is delicious, the Pita chips are phenomenal, complemented by the Tzatziki dip which is so good with chunks of cucumber. But you can have your choice of Sriracha Hummus which is also a great combo. This place is definitely a go to place any time you get a chance. Fresh, Lite, and amazing food. the employees are really nice as well."}
{"text":"Cedars Deli is the donair darling of Calgary. Whenever I crave for donairs, I'll always go to Cedars Deli even though there are closer restaurants nearby.   Once you pick your meat filling, they'll stuff your pita with your liking of assorted veg and sauces a la Subway. Their beef donairs are a force to be reckoned with. A regular donair for $8 is large enough to stuff you silly. My usual order of small donair and 8 Oz salad is enough to satisfy my belly, but not induce food coma, and all for the low price of $9!  Now, I bet you're thinking those prices for that much food is insane. However, the best part about Cedars is how well seasoned their meats are. Even if you load up your wrap with sauces (they have a variety!!!), the flavors from the meat still come through. This is impressive as I find the flavors of the meat often get lost in the veg and sauces at other restaurants.   They're vegetarian friendly with amazing falafel and salads. They have so many to choose from: tabbouleh, Greek, chick pea, couscous etc. I find the 8oz salad ($2.99) is large enough and they don't skimp. They fill the container right to the top!  Cedars Deli is deliiiiish and won't break the bank. Make sure you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Bright, clean place in a residential area, on a busy main road.  Has a few parking spots  in front.  The salad bar seemed fresh but the desserts is what caught my eye, so got the pistachio baklava and a triangle one that was a bit more sweeter, with honey but just right.  Very fluffy and flaky.  No amex here.    they also offer catering too, with some nice menus."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Best Donair I have had.  The place was clean, decent space and some outdoor patio. Patio needed some shade or umbrellas and the location is a little out of the way but if you are in the area worth a stop."}
{"text":"I love this place and it is always my Go To when we are at Market Mall and need a bite.  Have been to this location a few times..in fact tried my first ever Falafel here and loved it immediately!!  I love the tabbouleh salad and more recently tried the chicken shwarma.  Holy Huge Batman.  Couldn't finish it even though it was delicious.  And great prices.  My meal (which I shared) consisted of tabbouleh salad, chicken schwarma & a couple pieces of baklava for like $12.  The service is fabulous here...they are very friendly and helpful.  Make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"QUESTION: What's the size of a small dog or a young child's arm but is much more legal to consume?   ANSWER: A donair from this place.  Their donairs are massive. Their donair sauce is like angels weeping on your tongue. They are friendly, courteous and sometimes call you \"boss\".   You can also put pickles in your donair and they won't even make fun of you for being whiter than a snowstorm. They're just happy you stopped by.  Fresh food, big portions, reasonable prices, great ownership. If you're on Edmonton trail and your stomach is rumblin' for some shwarma, pull in and get happy."}
{"text":"Just wanted to reiterate how much I love Cedars deli, and that's pretty much all. Yesterday I was in grabbing a couple of falafel wraps, and there were some obnoxious gentleman in front of me who obviously had never tried Mediterranean eats before. The staff were incredibly patient, explaining what was in everything and being total champs.   While I was ordering my two falafel wraps, the gentleman making my delicious wraps suddenly demanded, \"Who is the other one for?\" In my head, this would proceed to turn into a Pulp Fiction moment.... \"DESCRIBE WHAT MARCELLUS WALLACE...LOOKS LIKE!\" *stuttering exchange involving guns occurs* \"DOES...HE... LOOK... LIKE... A ....BITCH?!\"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCrDuGyZ6FA  Of course, this isn't what actually happened. I told him it was for my mom, and they wrote MOM on the other falafel which was quite cute and helpful.  I enjoy all of my experiences at Cedar's Deli. The falafel is amazing, the salads taste fresh, and they prioritize customer service."}
{"text":"Of all of the Donair and Schwarma places in town, I just love this one.    They people are fast, efficient, and keep the food fresh and hot.  I was simply amazed by how quickly they got me a fresh chicken schwarma ready for me, complete with an impressive amount of veggies and well seasoned meat.    Pricing is actually much lower than most places in town I've been in ($7 for a full wrap sandwich??? Wow.), and the menu and meats are extensive and well covered.  I pretty much do have to come back to try the rest of the wraps soon.  Btw, there's not too much parking, so be ready to park on the street around lunch.  Plenty of seating though inside and out, and it's just  a pleasant vibe all around the second you walk in.    Thanks people for an excellent lunch!"}
{"text":"Downgraded from 5-stars to 4-stars as the last few times I've ordered for company functions they were missing items, this time I requested plates and there were none.  It's still a great place and good food though."}
{"text":"I have been told you can't make a fair judgement of the best donair in the city until you try it here. Cedar's is a nice little eat in shop right on Edmonton trail in quiet Tuxedo. The exterior's rather large friendly sign invites you in.   First, the sandwiches come in three sizes (small, regular, and jumbo) served on small and large pita wraps. The bigger you go, the more meat you get. I opted for the regular so as not to put pressure on my newly looser fitting pants. Ordering a classic beef donair, I loaded it with both the garlic and sweet sauce, and all the veggies. It was quite a heft sandwich.   Flavour... Yum, yum, delicious! The meat was a gene our helping and had great flavour on its own, the veggies especially the pickled turnip, peppers, and cucumber were bursting with juicy flavour. Hints of sweet, sour, salty, and heat were in each bite.   Still really hard to say, Jimmy's or Cedar's - you are definitely in for a treat. I would give Cedar's the slight edge when it comes to the veggies, price, and payment. And Jimmy's the slight edge on the meat and sauce. Both amazing donairs, and this will definitely be on the list of go tos."}
{"text":"Very good Libanese Food!!.. It was just  Delicious!.. I went there for lunch and I had the Beef Wrap and it was Great!!.. I can't wait to go back there and try other things of the menu!!.. In Addition, the service was Excellent!!.. I Definitely recommend this place 100%!!.."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place you have a problem in life!!"}
{"text":"Cheap shawarma for everyone! Yaaayyy!!! :-)  People at the counter are friendly and working like robots slicing and wrapping and packing and asking you about the ingredients and... well, like it always happens at a busy shawarma place, popular between the locals.  All the social backgrounds are welcome, so you can see some creative director and a bunch of other office high's sitting at the table next to a gang of painters or gas pump workers. Everyone happy chewing those immense wraps of shawarma, talking about their work-related stuff.  I like that false feeling of social equality leveraged against a pita stuffed with meat cuts mixed with vegetables.  Cedars was one of my default lunch destinations for almost 10 months I stayed in Calgary and failed me just twice - when their tiny parking lot was packed and the rest was covered with piles of snow. But I don't mind, it was my bad to go there at 12 - the place was already packed starting at like 11:30...  Hey, I even bought there a pack of mate - \"Cruz de Malta\" - what else can you ask from a shawarma place? :-)"}
