{"text":"The Red Rock salad was amazing and had the BEST blue cheese dressing. Very comfortable place with fresh food and great service."}
{"text":"Food is great, and the pastries delicious!! The employees are always friendly! Great food and great service!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Organic Restaurant in Summerlin! Great ambience, unique and flavorful menu items comprised of sustainably farmed and organic meats and vegetables. They also have yummy gelatos and pastries. Everything is fairly priced, considering the quality of the ingredients.    *If you're down on the Las Vegas strip w/ higher food standards ( healthy / natural / organic / fresh ) and have wheels, then it's worth the effort, and makes for a nice relaxing getaway from all the action. Brunch it up!*"}
{"text":"Latte very flat and flavor less. Breakfast Burrito mediocre with very little flavor. Strange ,ketchup bottles with labels completely removed on both sides . I really don't get that one. Decor/ atmosphere nice.  Will give it one more try."}
{"text":"I like the menu, food was very fresh and had good flavors. I ordered a salad, added chicken, but they forgot to put it on. I didn't immediately notice as I was chatting with a friend, but when I did I mentioned it to the somebody and their response was 'Oh, I'll mention it to them in the back'. Not great customer service, but I'll give them another shot as I would really like to see a local place with fresh food."}
{"text":"Ordered pastrami sandwich.  Questioned if it was pastrami when it was served (certainly didn't look like it).  Answer yes, it is shredded salami.  That's not mentioned on menu.  As others have said, 'where is the beef', in this case pastrami.  Two 2 inch squares about a quarter inch thick on a 5 inch bun.  Sweet potato fries were just okay."}
{"text":"Good food, great coffee and very nice hosts! I'll be back. Decor is very cool and the apple juice is fresh and delicious, I may even grab a beer here one day."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant I've been praying for!  My group of friends (5 in all) have different eating needs- one paleo, two gluten-free/veg, one is just picky, and one eats anything.  This is the only restaurant that can not only accommodate everyone, but offer more than one option for them to eat.  The restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere, small but not cramped and very clean.  The staff is very pleasant and well educated on the ingredients of the menu items.  And speaking of menu items, there is an amazing number of options,  The food is fresh and delicious, and nicely presented.  I've also gone to the Sunday brunch which I highly recommend.  Their omelet is the best I've had in a restaurant in Las Vegas,  And they have Peet's coffee-- my favorite.  I can't finish without mentioning the reasonable prices.  I don't know many places where I can go out and have a nice sandwich or burger with a salad for under $10.  I hope this restaurant flourishes for many years to come."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, but I felt this was seriously underrated. Beautiful atmosphere, nice lighting and music. We had carry out of a hamburger and half a salad with chicken and a few pastry items. Delicious! I loved the blue cheese dressing. My husband's burger was cooked perfectly, juicy, and a yummy bun. We will definitely go back, maybe even for date night. The prices were reasonable and frankly with the high quality ingredients, I felt were a deal. Try this place."}
{"text":"THE RESTAURANT AT THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. I have eaten here several times - but to my dismay, found it no longer in business at the village trails location."}
{"text":"Amazing! Organic eggs in the omelette and a perfectly made americano. The outside is deceptive; inside they have one of the most beautiful and unique restaurants in summerlin. Wish more people knew about this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times. Visits:  1) the food was tasty and quick. 2) This time I ordered carry out. When I got home food was missing from the order.  3) Ordered at the front desk. The food came out but was plated instead of to-go. After waiting nearly 10 minutes for the food to be boxed as originally requested I went to the counter to ask them what's up. The shaved headed cook in the kitchen wasn't happy with his staff and was telling then it took too long. I appreciated his acknowledgement and couldn't have agreed more. 4) Tonight I sat at the bar to order a beer and place a carry out order for my family. I was ignored by the blonde chick behind the bar for nearly 10 minutes while she focused solely on making a single smoothie for another customer. Not even as much as a smile or a \"Hello, I'll be right with you.\" I walked out and am now waiting at Vintner Grill for my carry out order to appear. Fix your staff and you'll have a good place. Until then, I'm done."}
{"text":"Notably bad food.  The decor is charming, and the location is lovely -- it's in that Summerlin shopping center across from the library that's very walkable and generally enjoyable.  The service was pleasant and friendly, but I also noticed that I was walking in during the middle of the afternoon, when the Starbucks nearby was packed elbow to elbow, and this place was so empty I checked the hours on the door to see if they were still open.  I ordered the quiche, and man, am I sorry I did.  It bore little resemblance to actual French quiche, or even the frozen quiche you can get from Trader Joe's.  It was grainy, even floury, and generally flavorless.  I was worried about it being underdone, but it was just simply bad.  Moreover, the menu is sort of a hodgepodge of French and other cuisines, which means that it's doing a number of different things, but none of them very well."}
{"text":"Let me start with ambiance - Summerlin needs a café like this. Reclaimed wood, rustic, French atmosphere. The kind of place that makes you happy. On my first visit at lunchtime, I had a cup of the Summerlin Soup and 1/2 chicken sandwich. Both were wonderful and hearty. Their selection of pastries and gluten-free fare is heavenly. I went back for breakfast and loved the Langostino omelette with baby lobster tails. Nice coffee menu, too. As I've said on previous reviews, any café that offers almond milk is fantastic to me."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. The food is really something special and the ambiance is bistro-casual with a little outdoor space that just adds to this place. A sandwich or burger, crispy fries, along with a glass of wine - I really can't ask for more. Don't forget to check out their sweets selection. I blame this place for my recent 5lbs ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing! After looking for multiple places to have breakfast, we settled on Jacques. The service was great! The girl up front was very helpful and convinced me ( a non-omelet eater) to get the langostina omelet. It was amazing. Highly recommend the French toast and salmon on croissant as well! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Really good food IF you stay and get past the way they do NOT greet you!  It's not France--you need to have good customer service!!!  ONLY because my husband is Belgian, we stayed, he's used to bad service.  It's NOT clear when you walk in what to do--sit?  Menus?  Ordering at front and having 3-4 empty/half assed stares by too many people is a Mc Donald's concept,  and uncomfortable.  Especially the blond running the register.  Put her somewhere else, NOT front!  Drip coffee overpriced then $.75 refill?  Mon Dieu!  Again, very good, get your customer service/set up straightened out.  Bonne Chance!!!"}
{"text":"I'm gluten-intolerant and LOVE Jacques Cafe. The food is delicious and healthy and there's a wide selection of really high-quality gluten-free items: quinoa and roasted veggies, pasta, burgers w/ GF bun, soups, hearty colorful salads, desserts. The quality is excellent: organic, grass-fed, hormone free, TASTY. And it's reasonably priced: I could easily fill up on excellent food for less than $10, if I weren't so tempted by all the delicious options (I order too much every time). I really wish Jacques was in Cambridge, MA where I work--I'd have lunch here every day. From Redrocks, it's quick to get here via 215 and Summerlin Parkway."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a reasonable price! Diverse menu great ambiance and great support staff. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Jacques allowed my networking group to hold a mixer at there restaurant, and it was wonderful!  Jacques came up with a custom menu for me, and everyone is raving about how delicious everything was!  I would recommend Jacques to everyone."}
{"text":"Great evening (Oct.) under the stars!  First of all, it's not a French restaurant, rather the chef is French.  They describe themselves as a \"casual American bistro.\"  Several of us went and had a great meal!  We shared appetizers: crab cakes, calamari, salmon sushi (special that day), and sweet potato fries.  They all were great (although the fries could have been crispier for me).  We all enjoyed our entrees.  I had the risotto with shrimp and asparagus and found it delicious.  We shared a couple of decadent desserts (made fresh and change daily).  We enjoyed the brownie with apricot pieces and a gelato with chocolate crunchies."}
{"text":"Excellent, healthy dishes and beautifully presented. Jacques is a master chef and artist. Love the ambiance."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The decor is great, so that's a decent start. I love the idea of a locally-owned non-chain restaurant (decent ones are hard to come by in Vegas), but I have some reservations about going back.   The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the selections are great in theory. We had a good experience there for breakfast, and I would encourage locals to check out their selection for \"first meal.\" They have fresh and tasty options in the morning.   However, during our visit for lunch, my husband and I both noticed that everything had the same flavor, which reminded us of Indian food. It seemed misplaced. For lunch, I had the minestrone and the garden burger. The minestrone lacked that distinct tangy, Italian flavor, and had a strong flavor that tasted like Indian food (as mentioned above). My husband tasted it and thought the same thing. The veggie patty had the same flavor as the soup. I prefer veggie patties to have a distinct garden-fresh flavor, so though the ingredients were fresh, the flavors were flat and disconnected. I have had probably a dozen, homemade veggie burgers in various restaurants around the country, and this was my least favorite. I couldn't finish it.   I hope they rethink the flavors on some of their offerings so the food is more bright and distinct. (I've eaten lunch and dinner here, and it all just tasted the same.) Also, the buns are way too dense and way too big. My husband had a burger, and disliked the bun as well. I would really like to see this place succeed, and I hope they consider refining their menu to get a foothold in the neighborhood. I will probably try breakfast there again, but not lunch or dinner unless they make some adjustments."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for yummy healthy food. I love the decor plus the variety of seating options. This place is under utilized. I loved it!  I had a salad with ponzu dressing with a side of tofu, best tofu ever!!!"}
{"text":"I drove 45 minutes expecting a special cafe treat. What I got was lack luster food and service. THe eggs were not cooked well and I got sick from that. The Latte was not as ordered and it took 30 minutes and constant nagging to get it served properly. What could have been a lovely bistro experience turned into a dismal experience that won't be repeated."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast and dinner! They also have great gelato for the kids. Wonderful service and ambience too"}
{"text":"Two nights ago feeling lazy about cooking, I was trying to decide where to dine that evening. I had thought about the new place, Jacques, but decided on the tried & true Woolghans in the Rampart casino.   Mistake!   While the food is serviceable, the service has gone downhill ! Long story short: I was suffering from diner's remorse for having overpaid for fish & chips and bad service.   Tonight, I dined @ Jacques . I ordered the seafood pasta.  The serving was generous, the pasta & seafood perfectly cooked, the tomato sauce was flavorful and light without overwhelming the pasta.  The price point with beverage and tip ran shy of $13....I felt redeemed from my bad dining choice of the previous night. While this is not a full service restaurant, the staff were pleasant and earnest in making a good impression-although I believe one staff person's question of whether I was having fun, I think,  meant to ask how I was enjoying my meal.   The decor is light and modern-a comfortable space.  It is exactly where you would want to go for a meal at the end of a busy work day or a simple evening out.  Jacques cafe is a no muss, no fuss, solid type of place.  No diner's remorse here......I will be back!"}
{"text":"Super trendy and vintage cafe located in the heart of Summerlin. I actually stumbled across here for lunch by accident, but I'm glad I did!   Unfortunately my diet is very limited due to some recent health problems, so I had to order a grilled chicken sandwich on a gluten free bun. I had to modify some of the sandwich (no onions and some other things). They put aioli on the sandwich and didn't put the Swiss cheese, so I wasn't too happy or thrilled (I can't have aioli- a huge problem with my digestion and it wasn't supposed to be on it). I was concerned because they put things I didn't ask for on it and didn't include all of the items I did ask for. For people with allergies like myself, that can be a huge problem. I scraped off all of it that I could. All in all, I would give my meal a 3/5.   My friend ordered the deli burger and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. He's actually still raving about it days later, so that was a 5/5 and he highly recommends it.   I appreciate how they do have gluten free and vegan options! Also extremely clean restrooms and comfortable outdoor seating. The inside was adorable, and the prices are very affordable! You can get lunch for under $10.   Worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened, and I've never had a bad experience. A couple of dishes might not have been prepared the way that I had hoped, but that's a personal preference. I have no connection to the owners or anyone that works there. I just wanted to say that they have great, unique options at a lower price point, and they are always extremely welcoming when I bring my young kids. My toddler son has both a wheat and dairy allergy/intolerance, and they have great options for him. The atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting, especially when you consider that the surrounding businesses are lower end places. I really hope that they do well."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service! Outside dining wonderful especially this time of year! Reasonable price. Will definitely be back!! Can accommodate large crowds too."}
{"text":"Pros:  -friendly & attentive service (they took our dish back when we told them it was cold and happily replaced it with another one done right!)  -sweet potato fries were YUM!  -quiet, comfortable, clean atmosphere  Cons:  -a bit pricey for the serving size"}
{"text":"Ordered the Wagyu Beef Sandwich, but it came with a little extra in it...a small blonde hair buried in the sandwich. I was asked if I wanted a refund and credited back for the sandwich, completely unapologetic. That's when I noticed a \"B\" rating from the health department. Don't waste your time eating here. Save your money for a better restaurant."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area, and were looking for a nice Sunday morning breakfast place.  We came here because of the reviews! And Jacque's Cafe didn't disappoint! The food was amazing! The people are welcoming and friendly. The plate presentation is beautiful and the taste .... well...we didn't want the meal to end!!! Wonderful cello music made our experience complete. Merci  beaucoup Jacque!! This will be our Sunday ritual from now on ."}
{"text":"..pure deliciousness ..friendly service ..very chill spot with healthy menu ..very clean with outdoor patio"}
{"text":"This is based only on one lunch time visit.  The line to order was short and quick.  As I had never been before I needed to scan the menu options for lunch. There is a small menu, but I prefer that. Too many choices become overwhelming. I settled on the brisket sandwich. It seemed that maybe the ingredients would not taste good together, but they tasted great. The sandwich had brisket that was very tender with great flavor, sauerkraut, peppers, and cheese. I believe and aioli as well. The sandwich was delicious, the bread crunchy. It comes with either a side salad or French fries. I chose the fries.  It was a lot of food. I ate half the sandwich, not many fries, they were good seasoned well. Just too filling. The service was efficient.  I look forward to going back to try another item from the lunch menu.  The prices were on point with the other places in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great and I love that they have healthy choices. Chicken was fresh and tasty. I also had the butternut squash soup which was amazing, maybe not as hot as I'd like but I can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is awesome I just wish I found it sooner. The food here is great. Pretty much everything on the menu is organic. Great for people that are eating clean. I've tried the Salmon burger, lobster omelette and eggs Benedict everything was amazing. There is brunch on Sunday's you can have mimosas and espressos. The staff is super friendly.   There is a great ambiance to this place. The decor is beautiful. The restaurant is really clean. They also have a patio area with a great view."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I love it! There's a group of us that go now and we like that we can all order independently and sit together in a very comfortable atmosphere too. Love the patio!  The food is incredibly fresh, organic, gluten free,  cooked beautifully, even fried items are not greasy or overdone. A nice mix of light and rich flavors in keeping with traditional French cuisine, and when we're a group, a great selection to satisfy the \"light healthy salad\" people as well as the \"meat and pasta\" people.  Service is great.  It's \"order and sit\" style but still feels like full service as tables are still tended and staff is very kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! Liked the food! Creative flavor profiles. Atmosphere was nice. Quiet, but not too quiet. The decor was fun and light. It's amazing what the owner was able to do with the spot after it was owned by Chronic taco. They did a great job of cleaning it up. I hope this place does well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place tucked away in the far corner of a shopping center. Not surprisingly, it was empty. The menu is simple and basic: soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches.   I asked about the size of the salads, and when they showed me the full size, I happily chose the half. At five bucks, that's a great deal! Fresh greens, lots of good stuff, and a spicy crunchy topping that was to die for. I could eat those like chips. Not a lot of drink options, but they do seem to have a beer & wine license, which would be great for dinner, not so much for lunch. (My day hadn't been THAT bad...)  The service was friendly and attentive, the restaurant itself was clean and attractive, and if I lived closer, I could see putting it into rotation. Given the location though, it's going to take a lot of regulars to keep this place from going under.  Shame...it's a perfect fit to the Summerlin clientele."}
{"text":"This was a great find on postmates tonight! Food was ready quickly and the dishes were well prepared for my take out!"}
{"text":"This is a great find! It is a hole in the wall located in a shopping plaza in Summerlin. The produce is fresh and of good quality. Have been coming here for some time, especially enjoy coming after church for brunch. Absolutely love the bonnini's! And they provide great customer service. The menu changes throughout the day, have not yet been able to try dinner but can't wait to do so! The only issue is that it can get pretty pricey..fries do not come with the meal and are charged at ala cart price."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here because most of the few reviews since the opening reference burgers- if I'm going to a place where the chef actually hails from France, I'm not there to order a burger. At least not on my first visit.  Stopped in for lunch with my guy- location is rustic chic with chalkboard menu and walk-up service, drinks in blue Ball brand canning jars, cute bar area and cozy seating. Lighting, fixtures, and other small details are quality- a lot of thought was put into the décor.  Seasoned brisket sandwich has onions and peppers, smoke gouda, and is a hefty size for the $9 price tag- pleasantly surprised. Awkward presentation in a bowl but I'll overlook that. Sides available include a salad or fries, opted for the latter which needed more crispiness.  EDIT: Dropping a star from my rating. Came back for a second meal that was far less satisfactory. The décor remains cute but the flavor seems to have been forgotten in the kitchen. Bummer, since there aren't many good dining options in this area to start with."}
{"text":"My wife and I were saddened when we found out that Jacques closed.  We always thought it was a gem of the restaurants in the area serving gourmet food at less than gourmet prices.  Having patronized the same shopping center for 15 years and seeing restaurants come and go, this closing hurts the most.  We can only hope that chef Jacque will give it another go."}
{"text":"Loved Jacques Cafe the first time, this time not so much. We ordered the same thing on both visits and the food couldn't have been more different. The Simple Burger and the Deli Burger were big and juicy on our first trip. Our second visit found the beef serving small, hard, and burnt. I ordered avocado on my Simple Burger and it was a healthy portion, unfortunately it was rock hard. I called over the waiter and told him about it. He just walked away. The Deli burger was served as a Simple Burger. When we complained we were brought out 2 tiny pieces of Pastrami and what I would swear was a piece of Kraft American cheese instead of the Cheddar in the menu.   Would never go back. We wanted a good burger tonight so went to Smash Burger. Great and always consistent."}
{"text":"My new favorite secret spot (not for long I am sure )  Great food done French cafeteria style  Every meal has been on spot - calamari - 1/2 slab and my new favorite \" turkey satay sandwich -ribs - all protein is organic - hormone free - antibiotic free - that's a huge plus for me  Wine by glass and bottle very reasonable  My third time here this week  And ran into a friend his 4 time this week !!!"}
{"text":"Okay -- gone here quite a few times -- will not be back--had a good experience once, but that was a while ago.     Walked in and was told they had full service today and to have a seat.   Waited ten minutes at a table in the front of the restaurant.    NO Acknowledgment at all.... Another couple walk in and TWO EMPLOYEES take  the new people's order...   We walked out and we will never go back.  Sorry Jacque, you need to get employees who work!  I previously posted a five star review--"}
{"text":"Loved the Tacos and green power drink I had, gotta return for the other items after seeing these Yelp photos, yum!   Finally, a gluten free, healthy and tasty restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love Jacques Cafe! Been here several times and think I've ordered something different every time. Never a bad choice!! Went there for their Valentines Day brunch where they had a wonderful duo performing. Nice to have wonderful live music while dining!!"}
{"text":"We ate there for brunch two adults and a three and four yr old.  The staff was nice and helpful. The atmosphere was pleasant. The food was fresh and delicious. The potatoes and French toast were great and there was lots of fresh fruit. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good clean food!  Grass fed beef, Salmon burgers, tilapia burgers,  quinoa plate... great menu! Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Was excited to go to this place based off the reviews. Beautiful decor at restaurant, you order the meal and then they bring it to your table. For an afternoon this place wasn't very busy.  I started waiting at the front with the cashier telling me to wait so she can finish what she was doing before she took my order. Once she was done being way too busy to help us, she finally looked up and took our order. I thought how long she took to help us was a little rude, especially because there wasn't anyone in front of us who had just ordered.   We sat ourselves and our food was delivered promptly. The burger I had was supposed to be cooked medium but was cooked well done- not sure why they even asked.  At the end of our meal the girl from the front came over to see if I needed a box. I said yes and she said she would be right back. 20 min later- no box. I then went up front and asked her what happened to the box- She looked at me confused and then remembered she never brought one.    If this place was busy I would understand the bad customer service- but it was so dead!  Between the burger being burnt and the terrible customer service- I was not happy about this place."}
{"text":"If you are on a gluten free diet please be very specific to tell the staff taking your order.  Because even though items on the menu are labeled GF, it does not mean they will come to you GF, as I found out today.  Two items I ordered were prepared with ingredients containing gluten, even though the menu labeled them GF and failed to list any ingredients containing gluten.  Unfortunately I ate a bit of one before realizing.   The staff was very apologetic and tried their best to rectify their error, but there is no fixing it once it's eaten.   I find a lot of restaurants are jumping on the GF bandwagon, but they need to realize the responsibility they take on when labeling food GF or free of any other allergen.  Allergen free labels are a promise that those menu items will not make their customers ill and we trust that chefs have done their research to back up the label.  That trust is lost my case.   I gave them two stars because what I was able to eat was fine taste wise.  The atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly.  I am sure if I had no dietary restriction I would have had a lovely experience with nothing bad to say, I just felt the need to let others know to be careful so they don't end up sick as well."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot that offers great food alternatives to the chain restaurants around. Ambiance and service were great and the portions were really generous. Will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This place was cute, my friends and I all loved the decor and the lighting. It felt bright and cheery inside. Everything else was lackluster and expensive!   For my lunch I chose the Asian burger with fries, ($7.95) a bowl of the Summerlin soup ($6.50) and an apricot beer ($12). The burger did not have any \"Asian flavors\" at all and it was super dry. It says it comes with house mayo, but they put hardly any on the burger so it was pretty tasteless. I would not order this again. The burger came with skinny fries, but they were nothing special and needed seasoning. I added salt, but it didn't help much. They do give you a lot of fries, and most of them went uneaten. The Summerlin soup was bland as well. It is described as: Cauliflower, squash, coconut milk, green curry, cilantro, pesto. I couldn't taste any curry or even pesto, skip this! I enjoyed the Apricot beer, and they give you a huge bottle (500ml). It was drier than most beers I have tried, but still tasty nonetheless.   After my meal, I decided to have some dessert. I checked out the baked goods case and decided on a piece of chocolate chip pie ($5.95). It was more like a cookie with chocolate and apricot? I think? in the middle. It was weird that this orange stuff was in this chocolate pie, and although I didn't mind this addition, it would have been nice to know it was going to be in there. So for my meal alone it was over $32! Fucking ridiculous. I don't mind paying good money for a good meal, but paying good money for a bad meal just makes me mad. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and delicious. True hidden gem. I love the outdoor patio. Great for kids and dogs!"}
{"text":"All honestly I never went to this restaurant before because I did not like the color of their logo, and I didn't know it was actually open. When I walked past it and realized it was open I decided to give it a try.  I have to say it was excellent.  The first time I ordered a black bean burger without the onions.  It was really good even though I had to pull the onions off myself.  I was surprised by how many sweet potato French fries came with the order.  So I decided to give the restaurant a 2nd shot.  This time I ordered the Asian burger.  It was exceptionally good. I was able to taste all the ingredients and it went very well. Yet again I got a large amount of sweet potato fries.  I can see this restaurant being very healthy yet I can see some options being not healthy at all.  I will definitely  be back for a third time."}
{"text":"This cafe was SO delicious! They had a good amount of vegan options and are mostly organic. Loved it! The location is beautiful and the vibe inside and outside is wonderful. Definitely will be a regular spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriends omelette was cold. I ordered the salmon salad with pesto ciabatta, they forgot the ciabatta. No big deal but when I asked if she was bringing it she said this is what was on the ticket and I pointed at the menu showed her exactly what I ordered. After I got a little sour attitude from her she went back inside( a second time) to check again and brought it out finally and it was cold. I don't even think the girl spoke English. I didn't take 1 bite. To top it off the ice tea tasted like it was in the kettle for a month. We are big brunch people and there's to many options in the area to deal with a bad attitude and cold food."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten here for lunch, but Jacques is a decently priced non-junk food option for a quick bite to eat, nothing above ordinary however. The atmosphere is pleasant with a nice outdoor dining area as well as a bar for the evening happy hour crowd. Service is abbreviated (think Panera where you order up front with the food is then brought to your table) however the staff have always been very nice."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito.  This is my favorite item here.  Gluten free pancakes if that's your thing, veggie omelette very different.  Packed w whole fresh veggies.  Really good, opposite of a greasy omelette.  What a quaint place off town center, sweet music, great lighting.  I had to write a review on this place, it has been getting weird reviews lately.  I would def check it out."}
{"text":"I can totally see why people love this place, but Yelp is based on different opinions of establishments, and for me, this place is just OK.  Not bad by any means, but nothing to brag about, nor drive out to Summerlin for.  I appreciate the options. Vegan, gluten free, and risotto at a casual place.  However, of the four dishes we got, I did NOT expect avocado tofu tacos to be the highlight.  For me, the risotto base was too fishy. Like salt water fishy, not yummy clam fishy.  The bolognese was great. The flavor of the salmon was as well, but the pasta underneath did not really do it for me.  I understand al dente, I am Italian, but there is a difference between straight undercooked, and al dente. With a delicious creamy mushroom alfredo sauce, I was disappointed that I could not eat the pasta.  This place seemed very family oriented, catering to a birthday party as we were there. I seen the main Chef guy in the back teaching the staff some kitchen techniques. Off to the side there is a big beautiful bar with contemporary yet family style decor.  If I was closer, I would see what this place has to offer in the future. They did mention only being open 3 months. But with it being so far for me, I doubt I will return.  I do recommend trying this place, especially if you are close! It might be right up your alley.  They do have both beer and wine on tap. As well as a pastry case full of goodies. I love the casual yet fancy vibe. Even though it was not my cup of tea, I would like to see this place succeed. I think they picked a good location for their style of cuisine."}
{"text":"A cute spot with a well-known Chef serving up some delicious fresh food. My trainer told took me to lunch after a session last week and I immediately enjoyed the warm welcoming setting.   They offer organic fruits and veggies, salads, burgers, breakfast, pastries, quiche, coffee, tea, beer and wine and tapas in the evening. Kind of cool that clean and dirty (!) eaters can find something they dig. Soups are a standout, had a taste of the Leek and it was yummy. My veggie omelette was cooked perfectly and they swapped out potatoes with a salad no problem; my trainer is enamored with the brisket and burger.   There's limited options in the immediate area for similar fare, and I love the commitment to healthy/organic and the food being cooked to order. These days it is crazy difficult to get to my *favorite* spot in the SW, this is a good nearby treat. Welcome to Summahood!"}
{"text":"2nd visit. Great food menu when I visited the 1st time! However, probably never ever going to sit at the bar ever again. Bartender had the bar skills of a 10 year old.  I sat at the bar, took the bartender 5 minutes to acknowledge me. I was the only one at the bar. Then when he finally acknowledged me, asked what I would like. I asked if he had any Moscato. He had no idea what that was. Then the phone rings, he answers then leaves me for ten minutes without taking my order. Then a server & a chef also passed by me asking if I needed anything. I told them I'd like to place an order as the bartender deserted me after I got trumped by a phone call that he took. They both giggled then moved on. What? Who trained them? Lack of customer service in a customer service, hospitality oriented city? Terrible!"}
{"text":"Drive in burger is absolutely delicious.. So much flavor! Sweet potato fries are on point. Not a fan of milkshakes but the peanut butter crunchy milkshake will make convert. Overall it's good, decent pricing and staff are friendly. Plus they have the cutest mason jars."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!! Great prices. I highly recommend the Langostino omlette. French toast is one of the best my wife has ever had. Wonderful, friendly service. My new favorite cafe'!!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and service has been average. The food has not been consistent and after my last visit I will most likely not go back. Besides the unhelpful service and seeing little bugs flying everywhere, the food has no flavor. My sweet potato fries were frozen. The selection of pastries are never the same and the employees never know what the pastries are. Sorry Jacques but things are just no good here."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Truly! WOW! Diverse and excellent menu. Chic, peaceful atmosphere. I will be back when in town.  It is worth the drive from downtown Vegas and from Red Rocks---from anywhere in Vegas. Everything we ordered was excellent, down to the bread. Love Vegan, gluten free, but truly this is a French chef who knows how to make super duper healthy, quality, yummy cuisine. So, even the bread is made from wheat from Europe--much different than usual American wheat. I don't do gluten, but I can eat bread in France, Italy and now Jaques Cafe in Vegas! All the soups are made from properly made homemade stock, he grinds his own meat for the burgers, all ingredients are super high quality. He could charge more but I'm grateful for his very reasonable prices. Can't recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"Hidden away in the northeast corner of the Trails Village shopping center there lives a quaint and inviting eatery called Jacques. I had the deli burger served medium-rare with a huge side of skinny fries and was immensely satisfied. All for under $10.00 and you may leave a tip in the jar as you pay for your meal at the counter. We sat outside under the shade structure which was roomy enough for our large party and pleasant enough for all invited. The food was on point and the staff willing to please. Terrific experience truly. Merci beacoup, Jacques, et a bientot!"}
{"text":"The owner approached to me and said that I was sitting  there too long, though I was the only customer! Also said that I used the bathroom for too long!"}
{"text":"Jacques Cafe was a wonderful find to satisfy both those of healthy and not so healthy appetites. For those who are gluten free, they make a great homemade gluten free bun as well as a very good apricot cobbler. Our first lunch here I had the black bean burger on ciabatta with sweet potato fries. Very satisfying!  The highlight of my lunch was definitely the dessert. They have a few different pastries (some gluten free) but the standout is the Bonini ice cream. When in the desert, indulge in ice cream!"}
{"text":"I am giving a three star review because of the great atmosphere and mediocre food.   Today I ate a quick lunch at Jacques Cafe well on break from work. When I first walked in I was greeted by a nice young man with a big smile. Yet the place is inviting and has a rustic feel, it can be misleading on the fact of I wasn't sure if it was a seat yourself or a chipotle style order upfront type place. Once I ordered and got my food I noticed I got regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered. Also the sandwich was a bit dry and could use a little more sweet and salty factor to it. The bread was to hard and a little low on protein if you know what in saying.   If you want a great environment with decent food and shy service this is your place, Jacques!"}
{"text":"Very nice little french surprise in a shopping mall center..new, but solid.  Loved the Minestronie Soup and the Pastrami sandwich..perfect we had all three soups, they do soup so perfect its like a vitamin pill for lunch...they have a dessert menu that rocks too..pretty cheap really for the quality...perfect first date place ...quaint but cozy..."}
{"text":"Wether you're a meat-eater, a vegetarian, or a vegan ... This place has something for you!! Small beer selection but GOOD beer selection. All that matters mimosas and other yummy options as well"}
{"text":"Jacques Cafe is located in the corner of the Village Center Circle in Summerlin...very clean and surprisingly modern and rustic setting at the same time--the ambience above the price-point for sure.  It's easy to please with rare and expensive ingredients...it's much harder to keep the price affordable and delicious at the same time...Jaques Cafe does that incredibly well for me.  They combine delicious home cooking featuring healthy, Vegan, and Gluten Free options with natural, organic ingredients.   We shared Miso soup, Rock Shrimp & Avocado Tacos, Provence Style Beef Short Ribs, Sterling Salmon Belly over pasta, and Cherry Pie...with a cup of Espresso.  The miso soup is made with organic, soy-free chickpeas miso with homemade salmon stock and seaweed at $1.95 for a cup...very flavorful and hearty--I was amazed to hear how chef Jacques made his own stock with Salmon bone. The Rock Shrimp & Avocado Tacos were so delicious!...with avocado and ginger sauce on top of the soft taco, these were one of my favorite tastes of the evening. The Short Ribs were marinated in red wine for 48 hours, then slow cooked for 4 hours...all organic, no hormones...only my tongue can testify how succulent it was. The pasta with the Salmon Belly was cooked perfectly al dente, and flavored with Shitake mushrooms in a beautiful cream sauce. We finished our meal with a Cherry Pie. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and a wonderful texture from the plentiful chunks of whole cherries...it went down so lusciously with a cup of Peet's Espresso.  JC offers Wine, Beer, Sake and Peet's Coffee and Mumi Organic Tea to pair or elevate your meals...though there are also standard soft drink options and mason jars for self-service water. There is a small section of dinner entrees that will cost you between $10 to $18.95 and they comes with choice of roasted vegetables or roasted red potatoes but most of their Lunch and Dinner items are less than $9.00! There is a kids menu that includes 6 options all priced at or under $5.20.  I don't know how they can deliver these fresh and good-for-you items with this price range, but I am grateful that we have this option.  - 2017 Review #11 -  P.S. as of February 2017, sadly Jacques Cafe is closed permanently...glad I was there."}
{"text":"I think I might be being generous... But I'm Giving it four stars. The location is super close to me, and I love the area. It's right near the gym and convenience is a huge plus for me. We met some friends here for lunch and decided to eat on the patio. The decor inside is great... The tables and chairs and art are all pretty rustic and beautiful. Their pastry counter looked good but I didn't stare too long... Didn't want to sabotage myself. We requested to have a server come out and take the order since we were already sitting down outside away from the counter.   They have some pretty interesting menu items. My boyfriend and I shared the quinoa salad... It had a nice array of veggies, but it was super super dry. According to the server, all the dressings were dairy base, which I found really odd. I added some Siraccha sauce... To give it a kick and kill the dryness. The minestrone soup was also prepared vegan, so we had some of that as well. It came out warm, not hot but it was tasty enough to compensate. We ordered mimosas. Finally a place that doesn't premix their mimosas or over use the juice! The water was pretty good as well. It was definitely different, give it a try.  Our friends ordered the burgers and fries and both looked pretty good and tasty. My boyfriend said the fries were great. I would definitely come back... I'll probably bring my own dressing... And I'll probably order something different with a little more flavorful. The service was great though. Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"A lovely, clean restaurant in Summerlin, reasonable prices, excellent service as well as simply delicious and ample food. My friend had the Wagyu shoulder, caramelized onions, red peppers. roast beef sandwich accompanied by a complementary salad.   I had the Homemade salmon patty, chia seed, served with fresh greens, which consisted of two patties, not one, along with the same complementary salad. Both sandwiches were served on Ciabatta bread, fresh and tasty.  When we inquired, \"How's your business been?\", our server said that business is excellent and that they'd just had a good breakfast run.  We'll return again and again."}
{"text":"Great surprise in a great hidden location. I had one of the burgers which was great. Sweet potato fries were some of the best I've ever had. Honestly I was surprised the meals are predominately under $10 .... the quality is much better than prices. The restaurant reminds me of a nicer MTO cafe with better prices... Or much better food than Rachel's with similar process. The kicker is the full service bar!  And the patio is great for outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Ordered salad and sweet potato fries, got 2 orders reg fries. Order taker could not tell me what was in veggie sandwich...said peppers, onions, lettuce and tomato. Wish small plates were available at lunch. Desperately in need of a manager on floor to oversee things and greet guest and tell them ordering process... People walk in and kinda wander around trying to figure out what to do. All the food was good so I think it's a case good back of house management but poor front of house. I sent an email to address on menu. got no response.. no webpage either...not smart in these times!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and see the cafe all the time but never really made it out for breakfast.  Glad we did today. Breakfast was excellent!! I had the salmon, avocado, cream cheese bonini, he had the Short Rib Omelette and then French Toast for our sweet tooth.  Everything was amazing and the staff was very friendly.  We will definitely be coming back.  #supportlocal"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Great food, variety, good prices! It's very pretty inside yet it's not too fancy. Also this place uses organic food and has vegan and gluten free options!"}
{"text":"WARNING! Google says they open at 7am. Yelp says they open at 9am. We POSTMATEed there at 9am on a Saturday Morning. Got a call from POSTMATEs at 9:15am saying that Jacques Cafe just called them and stated that they don't open until 11am. 11am???? Where the hell did that number come from? As a part of running a business, you should update online avenues where people can see accurate info about your business. I hyped this meal up to a friend that was very excited to have it at 9am. Now I look foolish. It kind of shows me that they don't take good care of the business and aren't organized enough to handle things like telling the public what time you open. Kind of an important part of opening a business....Makes me question that if they aren't capable enough to do that, how capable are they at making quality food?"}
{"text":"Welp... we almost didn't come In because the paper sign on the door says no brunch this summer... it's November, take the sign down. Ordered the salmon plate with veggies and the pastrami sandwich with fries. Both were below average. Veggies were under cooked salmon over cooked. Pastrami had no flavor except cheese. The iced tea is terrible. Cashier was nice, that was the second star. Good luck."}
{"text":"This place always holds true to its awesomeness! Service is wonderful. People are very nice. We had the veggie omelet and gluten free pancakes. They were both soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Well, after coming back 4 times, I needed to update. I nearly took it down a star because the service seemed to be slipping, and I encountered some seriously confused staff who had difficulty taking my order. My coffee drinks were lackluster, as well. On separate occasions I got a hot mocha and a blended mocha, and both were bland. I was so bummed, because I wanted to make this my \"regular\" place. However, on my most recent visit, we were greeted by 3 people I hadn't seen before, and they were all amazing! Very attentive, friendly, and on the ball. I got a regular Sumatra coffee, and it by itself was awesome, which says a lot. The new gluten free vegan sweet potato cookies were pretty tasty, too! A very pleasant experience all around, and I'm keeping it at 5 stars. I do hope they find a barista for the days I'm feeling like having indulgent coffee. Looking forward to spending more time there!"}
{"text":"This is our local hangout. Good beer, great food, lovely outdoor patio.  Our favorite cafe in town :)"}
{"text":"After a year of waiting, I'm so happy to see that Jacques cafe has finally opened . I came here on a soft opening night. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I was amazed by the choice of unique interior, the entire decor is as natural as it is. The concept of this restaurant is written on the front of the nicely written menu page.  The owner, the amazing chef Jacques, prepares everything from scratch, just like all other French chefs. He also makes his own delicious gelato and tasty sweets. I tried the grilled salmon with roasted vegetables . The salmon is perfectly cooked and the sauce tastes like smooth lemon cream. The roasted variety of vegetables are fresh and you can actually taste each of the vegtetable.I also tried the Jacques cheesecake.   The cheese cream is light and isn't that sweet either.  If you like a fresh healthy meal, Jacques cafe is the place to go.  I can't wait to try more of Jacques's food next time!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! Went there because we received a menu in the mail. Everything sounded good. What caught my eye was the fact they boast \"natural and organic\". I wanted to try the healthy shakes. Went for the Energy Boost shake which states natural peanut butter. After receiving the shake I notice Skippy Peanut Butter on the counter. Not even the natural one. Walked out and threw it away."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure I understand the mixed reviews for Jacques, as my husband and I have both had 3 excellent experiences here so far.  We recently temporarily moved in with family on this side of town and have been searching for a casual place to eat that has quality food and is not a chain. We are pretty picky about where we eat, like to support local businesses, and Jacques definitely fits the bill.  We can come in workout clothes or dress up a bit and it has a great atmosphere.  I love the decorations and the staff has been great.  Let's start with brunch... my husband had the breakfast burrito and he said it was delicious with nice highlights of veggies and butter.  I had a bite of his skillet potatoes which may have been the best I've had. Very tender inside with a nice crisp layer on the outside with just enough salt. I had their vegan quinoa special which was nice and refreshing.  It could have had more spice but overall it was a great meal.  I love how their dishes have lots of veggies in them and seems to be the highlight and not just a piece of kale garnish.  I also like that they use organic veggies and have gluten-free/vegan options too.    Another time we had dinner there and I had the sweet potato fries and east/west salad.  Both very good and hit the spot.  The chicken I added to the salad was a little dry and I think they likely need to brine before cooking which could help.  My husband had the turkey burger with side salad and again said it was really tasty and lots of veggies which we both prefer.   I also stopped by for a quick green smoothie for breakfast and it was really good and refreshing. I haven't tried any of the pastries, but I have my eye on the gluten-free brownie for a treat :)   I would also say that the prices are very reasonable for the quality and service. Some dishes are higher in price than your average fast food, but others are really reasonable. The serving sizes are just right and I don't have to waste food. I am willing to pay a little more for better food. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I needed a quick spot for breakfast looked on Yelp and found this cute little cafe they have Peet's Coffee which is super amazing and then I tried a pastrami and gouda omelette which was yummy can't wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"Giving two stars based on the food, location (walking distance from my house) and the decor are amazing... If it weren't for these things Id give negative stars, I've eaten here twice now and had very different experiences...  A few days ago I came here for the first time and brought my mom and Andy. We were very impressed with the rustic decor and the outside setting. It's absolutely beautiful on the patio.  We had the butternut soup, that was phenomenal. Butternut squash with creme frise and leeks for garnish.   For entrees we each had a different sandwich, I had the bbq brisket. I was expecting a bbq sauce since that's what the cashier told us.. but none of the less it was still great. Andy had the Pastrami sandwich which also was missing a sauce bit once we put their housemade Dijon mustard on it the sandwich was great.  The sweet potato fries are great as well!   Now for the second trip...  Came in last night (Tuesday around 7pm) and sat at the bar. We never received service, we waited about 10 minutes before we went up to the cashier. The girl told us the bartender never showed up so we had to order at the register. We ordered the calamari, shrimp tacos, and the butternut soup. I asked the girls (two blonde girls and one brunette) if there were any nuts in the tacos or the calamari. I AM DEATHLY ALLERGIC to tree nuts and peanuts. I've been admitted to the hospital twice with my throat closing due to my allergy. No one knew so they asked the cooks. They just shrugged and said there wasn't. When I asked if they were certain (i had forgotten my epipen at home because we walked to the restaurant) they started laughing at me.  We also ordered the Apricot Cider, so we took our drink and headed outside. When our food arrived we noticed the calamari was accompanied with a green sauce. The brunette told us it was a parsley sauce. We also noticed there weren't any leeks on the butternut soup... That made the soup very bland without the added flavor.  When I tried a piece of Calamari dipped in the parsley sauce it really tasted like pesto. Andy and I headed inside to ask about it. Because pesto 90% of the time is made with Pine nuts. We were told yes it was pesto. Andy dialed 911 because no one knew if there were nuts in the pesto. NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT KNEW. Then when I told the brunette girl my throat would literally close she LAUGHED and said oh don't be a drama queen, no it won't. ....  What can I even say about that. 20 minutes later we finally found out the pesto was nut free. After me having a full blown freak out panic attack it completely ruined my experience here. When asked if they could bring us ice cream on the house we declined and the blonde girl asked what could she bring us and I jokingly said another drink, she immediately brought us another bottle of apricot cider with a receipt. Then said we could pay for that anytime.   Now, I've worked in the service industry since I was 14. (13 Years now...) My professional opinion and advice is this, TRAIN YOUR STAFF. Especially the cooks. I can forgive a ditzy cashier girl but I can't forgive a \"chef\" that has no idea what they're cooking. Hire a manager to oversee daily operations and handle guest issues. If this would have happened to anyone else I'm sure they wouldn't have been as nice as Andy and I.   I want to come back. I liked the food and you can't beat the location. But these kinks need to be worked out before they kill someone, because no one is trained or held accountable."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Jacque's and it's great location.  Went for lunch with 4 friends.  The place is clean and tidy with decent new decor and ample seating, better use of space and decor than the last tenant, but held-over floor planning on the entry is confusing.  Here are the challenges that lead to this rating, in order of occurrence.  I hope they can fix them.  1.  They seated us, then waited until we asked to send us back to the front where we were to order our own food at something of a counter, despite lots of wait staff.  Because the 'order yourself' Chipotle-style was not clear, it was aggravating.  2.  There is no French food here.  The entire menu is variations on the American theme.  The categorization of French is a mistake.  3.  Cappuccinos were served in big coffee mugs, basically a weak, too-much-milk latte with a little foam on top.  4.  \"Asian Burger\" was a dry, unseasoned small piece of lean ground beef that had been brushed with some kind of tempura or soy.  Nothing else asian about it.    5.  \"Salmon Burger\" was dry, sparsely seasoned deep fried piece of fish on a bun with some lettuce.  6.  SERVICE:    When one of our party asked them to fix the far-from-correct cappuccino, she was told \"I'll have to charge you for that.\"    When we were asked how everything was, we politely began to voice that the salmon sandwiches were not satisfactory (dry), but got hushed by the wait staff who told us \"I had it yesterday and it was good.\"  No offer of any kind to fix anything.  SUGGESTIONS:  Just take the orders at the tables and be done with it.  We ran up to the counter several times, sometimes while the wait staff was also arriving at the table.  Get a barrista  Add some French food  Seasoning, seasoning, seasoning  Train wait staff in customer service and satisfaction  Overall, completely underwhelming to all in our party.  We were disappointed and hope the bugs can be worked out, as we'd love to return if they do."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere, service and entrees.  Chef Jaques Jas brought a flair to Summerlin North. Ribs, Chicken Fettuccine recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. The staff was helpful with the menu, courteous, and attentive. The menu has a great selection of FRESH food and desserts. The decoration of the place is very charming and comfortable. And finally, THE FOOD! I got the tofu avocado tacos, my husband got the garden burger, and we shared the tempura cauliflower. The tacos were so fresh and delicious, and the tofu was cooked and seasoned very well. The garden burger tasted great and didn't make you feel gross after eating it, like some burgers do. We're typically not vegetarians but we like to try vegetarian dishes from time to time, and this time definitely made it worth it. The cauliflower was also very good. We are very impressed with this place and will be returning customers."}
{"text":"A new entry into the growing fast-casual market, Jacques Cafe in Summerlin can lay claim to plenty of buzzwords used these days when marketing restaurants -- chef-drive, sustainable, quality ingredients, scratch kitchen, etc. But don't let the name on the door fool you. This isn't a French bistro. It's a modern American cafe with an extensive menu ranging from casual soups and sandwiches to more refined entrees.  There seems to be an aversion to plates as everything I've seen has arrived in bowls. That includes burgers and a tough beef brisket sandwich with an over abundance of artichokes and red peppers. Another let down was the butternut soup with a consistentcy of a lumpy gravy instead of a silky smooth soup.  Entrees seem to be the way to go. A half order of ribs, with meat easily separated from the bone with the slightest push from my fork, were covered in a sauce with hints of sweetness and bitterness and topped with microgreens that added some visual brightness. Even better was the Provence style beef short ribs. Rich yet earthy, it was a healthy portion of tender beef with little connective tissue or fat that was accompanied by roasted vegetables. The place is also kid-friendly. Hand breaded with a tempura batter, chicken tenders were under seasoned, but will satisfy most kids.   Baked good are made in-house. The cheesecake topped with chocolate pearls and crystalized sugar was decent, but would have been much better if they had let it defrost a while longer. Part of it was so frozen I just had to toss it in the trash. The chocolate blueberry brownie displayed a nice balance of sweet and tart notes. For those that are gluten sensitive, they have plenty of offerings like dark chocolate muffin and a surprisingly chewy chocolate chip cookie.  While the food was hit or miss, I love the fast-casual concept with its upscale vibe, and rustic-chic decor. The broad range of modern American fare should be enough to get people in the door, but their overall quality and consistency needs to improve to keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Great getaway for a sophisticated, reasonably priced meal with a friendly staff. Our favorite neighborhood place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for any meal!  Warm friendly atmosphere and delicious food!   Avocado tofu tacos my favorite!  Salmon burger another family favorite along with pasta bolognese.   A total favorite spot to Dine!!   Wine and beer very affordable with a lovely selection from which to choose.    Every person that works here from front manager to on duty chef to Owner Jacques- is smiling and welcoming.  A PERFECT valentine spot!!"}
{"text":"We were super busy at work yesterday so our employer decided  to treat us to \"Free Food Friday\". So we chose Jacques Cafe.  Once I got everyone's order,  I proceeded to call it in.  Whoever  took my order, was very friendly but it was as if she was not paying any attention to my order.  I was asked to repeat my order a few times and she kept apologizing, saying that her \"mind is drawing blanks right now\". Here is what we ordered and what we received: 1-Brisket Sandwich with mixed greens- 1-Summerlin Soup-tasty soup,  but was a little too thin for my liking. 1-Caesar Salad with Chicken (add avocado,  add bacon & add Asiago Cheese)-all we got was a Caesar salad  with some Chicken. None of the \"add-ons\" were added to the salad.  But yet it was added to our receipt. 2-East West Salad (add Chicken & bread on the side) No bread but the salad was very good.  I enjoyed the crispy chickpeas and dressing.  However,  If I ever order this salad again,  I will get it without the Shitake Mushrooms!! Totally made my salad smell like feet!!  Not too excited for this place now that Ive tried it,  but  I have given second chances before."}
{"text":"Maybe the hours should say they're open 'til 8:45. I showed up at 8:50 and the girl told me they usually close 5-10 minutes early. Lame."}
{"text":"Glad there's a healthy place nearby!!!  My beau surprised me with a nice meal after work from Jacques. This is what he ordered:  -tofu avocado taco -garden burger -sweet potato fries -frozen yogurt with berries  Tofu tacos were delicious!!! Almost tasted like fish tacos! I could seriously eat those all day. Seasoning was just right especially when you add some lemon juice. Garden burger was also really good, although my only complaint was that the patty was too salty and a bit mushy. Wish that it was somewhat crispy to give the burger some texture. Sweet potato fries were average, nothing special here. Frozen yogurt was great! But be warned... It doesn't taste like your average froyo, it tastes like actual yogurt that's still a touch sour, but is neutralized by the berry sauce or mochi that you add. I personally liked it, but then again I like \"different\" tastes.  Jacques cafe was tasty and I'll definitely be back to try more of their dinner portion like pasta and short ribs. They also have a lunch menu that's under $10 so super affordable. And if your health conscious, all their foods are labeled with V (vegan) GF (gluten free)  A (ginger aioli). Good job, boyfriend!!!"}
{"text":"Just disgusting.  Got the salad that was recommended and it was inedible.  So close to my house but I will never."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm seeing poor reviews for this place! I literally come here one a week at most, and I haven't experienced anything that would even hurt my opinion of them.  The decor in the restaurant is awesome. It has a french theme going on, so everything looks elegant and beautiful.   The food. I love it. I normally get their Drive-In burger and its amazing. It's juicy, the sauce is delicious, just everything about it is delish. When I originally came here a few months back, I didn't think much of the burger honestly. But they've improved the quality a lot since then!   The Bonini ice cream is just, I can't even put it into words. If you have a sweet tooth like I have, you'd love it. It's ice cream and chocolate crunch, all wrapped up in a heated sweet bun.  Overall, great service, great food, and great pricing as well."}
{"text":"What a delightful shop.  Food is very good and reasonably priced.  The offerings will resonate with the gluten free, organic, local, neighborhood, farm to table, sustainable, free range, Non-GMO crowd as well.  In addition, a small but nice selection of beer and wine is available to wash it all down with.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  It could be great.   I hope they read this review in the spirit intended... to help build another great \"locals\" place so here's my \"consumer feedback\"  The concept is interesting but confused.  You can order up front or get table service.  I opted for table service but the person that served was sweet as can be but didn't know the food that well and wasn't really a trained server.  A for effort but unless you are actually prepared to serve, just run it like a deli.  Orders up front and they drop the food at your table but that's it.  The menu was even more confusing.  My dining partner and I went over the salads and after saying 'Yuck\" out loud we talked about the ingredients.  Just way too many and not particularly appetizing.  I was confused because I just spent several weeks in Lyon, France and their food was fresh, simple and absolutely delicious everywhere.  Even the 4-5 star restaurants with classic complicated french cuisine just didn't confuse so many things with another.  Going past the salads and on to the soups... same thing only not as bad.  In fact, the entire menu is like it doesn't know what it wants to be.  This place could be a real find if they can cut the menu in half and simplify the food.   It's got a nice little patio, everyone there was friendly.  It's in a spot where there really isn't any other \"grab a bite and a glass of wine\" place, etc.  On the wine - I didn't care for any of the wines on the list but my dining partner did and commented on how reasonable the prices were.  There were several on her \"affordable favorites\" that she knew the retail price and commented their mark-up was really low.  I hope Jacques makes it because it could be charming AND crowded all the time.  FYI - Hawaiian bread in a French restaurant?  Noooooooo!!!  FRENCH bread of every kind was so good in France, why not make it here?"}
{"text":"How does this not have 5 stars?! This is my favorite spot. It's very rare to find this type of cafe in Las Vegas, trust me I'm a native. Their chicken sandwich is amazing. I also love their deli burger. Everything is so fresh and so full of flavor. I hope it lasts in this shopping center, it seems like not many places stay here, which makes me wonder what greedy person owns this business plaza. Side note rant done! Thank you Jacques for bringing your awesomeness here!!"}
{"text":"The pastrami was amazing, sweet potato fries were delish! The wait was a little longer than expected, about 15 - 20 minutes. It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place ... Super cute inside with a great outdoor terrace. We had the burger and fries which were both excellent. Kids grilled cheese excellent ! Gelato was very good also. Highly recommend !! Check it out"}
{"text":"the place looks good and the prices make you believe you are in for a culinary treat.  you're not.  went today for sunday brunch.  small and scattered menu with nothing that stands out as a must try.  I opted for scrambled eggs.  I specifically asked that they be prepared soft and was assured they would be.  when they came out they were clearly overcooked as evidenced by the brown crust throughout and the unappetizing rubber texture.  the cashier that took my order asked if they were ok and she offered to have them replaced (I added a star for her efforts).  the new eggs that came out were equally bad as they were partially cooked and partially raw.  eggs are very hard to cook properly, however, there are literally thousands of youtube videos that show proper technique.  It can be done.   my companion's omelet was equally overcooked.  watch Jacques Pepin cook an omelet.  that's how it's done.  we also shared this thing that was a crabcake baked into some kind of pancake.  it was just weird.  way too much breading and the crabcake inside was blah."}
{"text":"I stopped here after an appointment for breakfast.  Since I had read the Yelp reviews, I knew that I had to order at the counter and not just be seated.  On entering, there's a good-sized sign pointing the way to the right and around to go past the bakery cases to get to the ordering area.  I picked up the menu and looked it over.  I ordered the Langosteno omelette and coffee.  For a limited time, coffee is free between 7 AM and 9 AM with $.75 for a refill.  The woman at the counter put a mug down in front of one of the tall thermos containers with a pump.  I filled my cup, walked to a table, and waited for my breakfast to arrive.  It took a reasonable amount of time and she arrived with the omelette.  The omelette had spinach, tomato, and langosteno and was topped with homemade Hollandaise.  On the side were some purple fingerling potatoes and two slices of orange and two pieces of watermelon.    The omelette was good.  The potatoes had not been dried and water from them soaked down the plate and diluted the Hollandaise.  In the corner, under the fruit, there was some unadulterated Hollandaise and it was very good.    Breakfast was OK.  I am not a fan of serve yourself at a restaurant but I understand the business model.  Still, I like to be served coffee and have someone come around and refill my cup.  Jacques is OK but I see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"They open 7am to 9pm today came and had breakfast at 745... Such a beautiful Labor Day I decided to come have breakfast before heading to red rock... And I wasn't disappointed... Such a lovely cafe in Summerlin... Coffee was great staff very pleasant and welcoming bonini and ham egg quiche was amazing will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Great little visit with my girlfriend at Jacque's Cafe. It's a nice secret out in Summerlin. Although it's a little dark, it helps create a more personal ambiance with your company.  I had the Baja Burger with avocado and French fries. With the chorizo and jalapeño cheese it was a triumph of flavor. My \"side\" was the Bonini burger, a deep fried burger essentially enveloped in a pancake. Inner fat kid rejoiced.   Staff came to assist us even though we spent ample time scouring the menu deciding what to order at a table...and you're supposed to order at the register prior. Great service throughout! Very friendly staff.  My girl had the Provence style beef short ribs with grilled vegetables. The entree was savory. The only shortcoming was the lack of options for her side dish.  We will return to try the Asian burger and a salad next visit.  There are lots of great options for Gluten Free and Vegetarian visitors as well, although neither of us went with those options."}
{"text":"The ambiance and customer friendliness of this place is superior.  The location is great, tucked away in a nice area. Unfortunately some of the food needs improvement.  The Bonini Burger tasted great but was too dry, a side of au jus would have perfected it. The Turkey Satay sandwich was not balanced well -- the bread was excessive and there was a lot of vegetables on it.  Also, please serve your sandwiches on plates... not in bowls. As for the side salad, french fries, and latte, they were all really good."}
{"text":"This restaurant experience was wonderful from the time I walked in the door until I left. The amazing key personnel was friendly and efficient, smiling the entire time I watched her serve the customers. The food was beyond excellent and I could NOT believe the choices which were varied. The servers brought the food in a timely manner and it was fresh, hot and tasty. I would highly recommend Jacques for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You can't go wrong with this eatery!!"}
{"text":"A new hidden gem  Located in the small strip mall on town centre  in Summerlin. With Starbucks, Vons and CVS are all located in the strip mall adjacent.  Jacques was a little surprise. With nice new and up to date cafe that stands out among its local competitors, Jacques I believe is the next hotspot in Sunmerlin.  With a great selection, offering pastries, sandwiches, burgers, salads, gelato with other assorted dessert types.  One thing I realized is the side bar. Offering up Beer and Wine to wash your meal down or to grab a drink with friends. The layout has plenty of chairs,high tops and group seating to choose from.  So getting into the food: Brisket sandwich is pretty dam good! Probably the best sandwich on the menu hands down! The side salad that comes with it the sandwich has an awesome home made dressing.  I can't wait to comeback and sample the rest of the menu.  Overall Drink: 4-5 Food: 4-5 Service: 4-5 Coming back: yes"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I love that they have organic, vegan, gluten free, and even tea options. Every time i've gone in, the staff is super friendly and helpful. The first time I went in, I probably looked like a deer in headlights because I was confused on what to order, I couldn't believe they had so many vegan and organic options. I was definitely surprised. The food was great, the decor was so nice. Ive been both, during lunch and dinner. I've sat on the patio and loved it. I love sitting inside at night. They dim the lights and it can be very romantical. I love this place. I hope they don't change things, and stay the way they are."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and loved everything! The brisket sandwich on the lunch menu, the salmon burger, deli burger - can't wait to go back and try new dishes. Very creative &  unusual menu, great atmosphere, delicious and fresh food. I highly recommend Jacques!"}
{"text":"First time here and I am VERY IMPRESSED!!!  I had the Summerlin Soup, cauliflower, squash, coconut milk, green curry and Gouda cheese. And the Red Rock salad which was out of this world.  Can't wait to come back.   I've been looking for a place like this forever.   Whew . . . Glad I found it.  See you tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and amazing coffee. Order at register then they bring food out. Great patio area, was allowed to bring my dog out there!!! Gluten free pancakes were amazing! Definitely worth trying out"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food and the outdoor seating are both fabulous. Also the \"ghost rider\" draft beer is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Jacques Cafe is practically walking distance (well, it is for others, but I'm not an other) and I hadn't been there yet.  So when my usual Happy Hour crew suggested it, I went along with the crowd, even though I knew that it wasn't going to be that kind of place.    The six of us were seated just beyond the entrance, so I didn't really get a good look at the restaurant.  And since we were a group, the staff made it very easy for us and took our orders, which is not the M.O.  They serve beer and wine at very reasonable prices, making us a very happy and congenial group.  The wine is served in Riedel-type stemless glasses.  Everyone ordered a burger - a couple of salmon burgers, a turkey, the rest beef.  I was very glad to be able to substitute a turkey burger for the beef in my baja burger, which had ground chorizo on top of the patty, jalapeno jack cheese, along with a delicious aioli spread on the torta roll (you can substitute different things for the roll, including gluten-free bread, if you're into the anti-gluten fad du jour).  I was also able to substitute a salad for the fries.  The salad could have used a few more thingies, but it was good anyway - fresh butter lettuce along with some avocado crunchies, and a deliciously unusual house dressing.  I tasted the fries some of my skinnier friends ordered, and they were excellent, the sweet potato ones better than the plain ones, even though I'm not a great sweet potato lover.  With great service, and five other friends who really enjoyed their meals as well, Jacques was a winner.  Now if they'd only stay open later, I'd love to come back with Herb, but we always seem to be having dinner long after their 9 pm closing.  And I don't do breakfast.  But I'm sure we'll find a way."}
{"text":"Great food here. Very fresh and a nice mix of flavors. Has a good selection of healthy options.   The gelato is also insane. Definitely worth a try!   I've had a few dishes here but the pastrami omelet and the red rock salad are wonderful. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"**THIS PLACE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED Love the food here!  The sandwiches are my favorite. The staff is really nice and the style/decorating is really quaint. It's my new favorite place!!  I don't live that close but it's totally worth the drive.  *Updated to add:  Every time we've come here there's not a lot of people, and I wonder if part of that is because they have very limited/unpredictable hours. The last three times we've wanted to come, they were closed. Today is Friday at 4 PM and we drove all the way here. They should be open according to their restaurant hours but they are closed again. I'm not sure how much business we can give if they are closed every time we want to come. Such a shame. Their food is 5 stars, their hours are 3 stars."}
{"text":"Still astounded by the quality and price of this menu. Everything I've tried has been superb."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile now. Have had breakfast, lunch and dinner several times each. Always excellent.  Organic, gluten free, as well as standard fare always available. Its always 4 of us and never had a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot! If you desire nourishment avec taste, voilá. A cross between French flavor et American heartiness; sans the pretentious nor overindulgence. C'est fantastique!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always delicious. Some of our favorites are the crab cakes (perfectly cooked and seasoned); cafe greens salad; fish & chips (best); peanut butter shake (to die for); Alfredo pasta with chicken; skinny French fries; calamari; and butternut squash soup with miso rock shrimp and roasted leeks (amazing). Atmosphere is casual and they serve wine and beer. Best of all it's all organic. It's tucked away in the Trails shopping center in Summerlin. Definitely one of our favorites."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here at Jacques! It makes me feel like I'm somewhere else. The outdoor seating is probably my favorite area; as for the interior, it's a little dark, but I am a sucker for subway tile and succulents!  The food--I'm very glad they have numerous options here, especially for those of us with specific dietary restrictions. It can definitely be difficult sometimes, so I commend them for that. I get the garden burger or the veggie sandwich, both of which come with a choice of side. I always pick the fries. Their fries taste good and always have a good crisp! Plus, they're the skinny kind, and I like to be able to shove a handful of fries in my mouth all at once with absolutely no shame.  Overall, I do like coming here, but I will mention some consistency issues.  One afternoon, I ordered myself a cappuccino. It tasted like 100% skim milk, as if there weren't anything else. It didn't taste like it had any trace of espresso, yet the color was definitely there.  Another afternoon, my French fries had visible sprinkles of paprika. I certainly don't mind paprika at all, in fact, I think they taste great with fries. But the last time I had ordered them, there were plain. Now, I honestly have no idea if they're supposed to have paprika or not. It's alright though, they were good either way!  I still recommend trying out Jacques--perfect for those fair-weathered days, for lunch, for fries... Just go and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is a cute cafe with organic food and a very relaxed atmosphere. You also have the option to dine outside which makes your experience even more relaxing.  Most of the menu items are gluten free and vegan which makes it a very healthy dining option. During lunch they offer combos, soup and salad or sandwich with soup or salad. I tried the summerlin soup which was just ok. However, the chicken sandwich was great, I would totally recommend it.  They also have a yummy selection of pastries and gelato! The customer service is great, they definitely try the best to connect with their customers and make you feel welcomed.   Apparently they are also open for dinner!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Jaques for lunch yesterday.  The food was outstanding.  Fresh, great quality and innovative!!!!  I had the porcine mushroom and butternut squash soup and half grilled chicken sandwich on a cibatta bread.  very yummy!  I did not have any of their pastries, but I was tempted.  I tend to be a regular at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out since it is very close to my house, and I love it! It's super clean, I love the decor and the atmosphere of the place. Me and my sister got lunch here and we both enjoyed it very much. She got the grilled chicken sandwich and butternut soup. I got the salmon burger and French fries. I plan on going here more often and introducing it to my friends!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this hidden gem in the Trails shopping plaza. Casual with classy touch. Food is fresh- organic, vegetarian, gluten free options and a refreshing change from all those same-old cafes. Delicious dinner options. A MUST go-to neighborhood place for locals . BIG thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This could be a great place if they find a focus for their restaurant. I thought it was a French style coffee shop because of the name. They did have some French pastries, but the very small coffee selection menu was difficult to find, on a small chalkboard behind the register. They did not have an expansive coffee drink menu that you would expect from a \"cafe\".  The food selection was also scattered. There was a few French items (the name \"Jacques\" imparts it's a French place), but also pastas, sandwiches and burgers.  It's very nice inside and the staff were great, but I'm not really sure what this place is."}
{"text":"I love this place! Dining room is cozy and beautiful decorations, the food is amazing with quality and price, homemade pastries and gelatos. Thanks for the effort putting into this place. I'd recommend to anyone...support quality local business."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and inviting. Their service was good. Prices are a little high for what they are serving but the food is good!! Decor was really nice and they had good-vibe music playing. I wasn't able to try any deserts but I definitely will be back. Glad I live really close by but their hours are a little confusing. They have breakfast brunch and dinner hours but are closed during certain hours but open to serve..something? It was extremely confusing."}
{"text":"Lovely local french style cafe.  Organics themed in their ingredients and decor.  Smoked salmon bonini is my weekly go-to breakfast here along with a green shake.  For lunch, try the seaweed salad and add salmon belly.  You can't find food that's made here anywhere else, hence earning 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying, the staff was lovely. This review is actually more for the restaurant owner and more specifically a breakfast review.  I really love the concept and outdoor dining area. And we love supporting independent business, particularly restaurants. I personally don't like paying at the counter each and every time I want something, it's a bit of a pain and can't really enjoy my meal when I have to walk up every few minutes and then pay again.    My husband and I both had an omelet which were quite good!  On the downside, the potatoes we dry and not palatable. Perhaps offering another option like hash browns or fries would be nice.  The add on's were bit of  a disappointment, I personally would prefer to be offered toast or a muffin with each meal, because that's just standard.   My son had the pancakes and they were very dry, he only had one bite.   My cappuccino was lovely and perfect combination. My husbands coffee was really awful and they ended up charging him again when he asked for a different cup.   Outdoor seating area was really comfortable and great if you have kids because it's enclosed.  I think if they offer toast/muffins as part of your meal and  better potato option for breakfast and tweak the coffee it could be a  breakfast contender. And I would definitely offer a kids menu, we take our son for breakfast every Sunday and that's just a nice feature for families.  That said, I won't be going back as its on the on the high end for breakfast and it doesn't offset the cost enough for me when there are better options for breakfast in Summerlin. If however they tweak a few things, I might check it out again."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for both lunch and dinner.  They have a large selection for every taste.  Their vegetarian and gluten free menu options give so many options to choose from.  For lunch, I had the black bean burger and cafe salad.  The portions are great and the ingredients are always top notch."}
{"text":"After pilates, my friends and I were looking for somewhere to eat and happened to stumble upon this place. None of us were trying to spend a lot of money, and we all appreciated that the lunch menu had \"$9 and under\" right in the front. With that being said, they had a good amount of food choices including healthy smoothies and vegan/gluten free options, which was nice. When we got our food, none of us were disappointed with the taste. The place was open, spacious and very comfortable, which was great."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch.  50/50.  The orange juice,  fruit,  pancakes,  bacon and omelet were good.   The potatoes were room temperature, not seasoned,  not flavorful,   and seemed be sitting around for a while.   The Peets coffee was terrible and sadly enough it was fresh brewed.  We don't think it really was Peets as we've had that brand before.  Overall it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Really nice change from your typical cafe! Felt like we were in San Diego the vibe was nice! Great healthy choices! I ordered the half grilled chicken sandwich, prob would not order again, with a spinach salad with cesear dressing. I did not like the dressing at all can't lie... I loved how fresh everything was though! Also the price point very reasonable for the quality of food! My friend ordered the Pastrami sandwich!! OMG!! The absolute best pastrami sandwich I've had ever! Like ever! The owner said the cook it for like 6 hrs it's legit amazing!!!!! And the sweet potato fries! Omg so bomb! We shared a dark choc shake!!! Soooo Delisha! We absolutely will be back again, cheap quality food you can't beat it! Our whole bill was like $22 #winning'"}
{"text":"We came by the Thai place next door and when we saw that they were strictly take out, we decided to go look next door. I'm very glad we did! The service was great, with the food coming out quickly and the servers being engaging and welcoming.The decor is nice and the patio will be great for when it's no longer triple digit temperatures. We split a burger and a salad and the Kid had chicken tenders. The burger was delicious, even though the patty was a little on the small side. I love that they offered roasted veggies for the kids meal, but they were unfortunately seasoned for an adult palate (I ended up enjoying them). The salad was just a simple side salad, but they have these avocado crunchy things that are a delicious replacement for croutons. Great fries, and they have beer and wine. The owner was there and we had a nice chat. Then the bill came and it was so reasonable! Look forward to coming back soon and often."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland food. Had the sandwich salad lunch combo. Roast beef was tasteless and dry and the salad was sad and limp. :("}
{"text":"Quality food, extremely well prepared... Simple food is lost... Thank you Jaques for reminding your customers what the product really tastes like... It's all in the preparation..."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we have a neighborhood restaurant that uses quality ingredients.  I just scarfed down the chorizo burger with bacon.  HEAVEN! The sweet potatoe fries were great. Here's the best part ... it's very affordable! The restaurant interior decor is classy french inspired. convenience, value and tasty quality food is a tough combo to beat. Many menu items are vegan and / or gluten free. AAA +++."}
{"text":"Only been here for lunch....nice menu selection, comfortable setting, very attentive server staff. Fresh, tasty ingredients....very well executed"}
{"text":"Hope to actually try it sometime. Showed up for breakfast with four friends at 8:20 a.m. Yelp lists breakfast hours as 7:00 a.m. but the cafe does not open until 9:00 a.m."}
{"text":"Ugh, I should have read the other reviews here first! We came based on some high recommendations from friends. While ordering, we mentioned we chose the Summerlin Soup because we wanted the curry flavor. As others have noted, it was very bland and sludgy (and ours did not come with the micro greens in someone else's picture). More importantly, there was no green curry flavor (and no discernible cilantro or pesto either, when we later looked at the ingredient list on the menu)! When the hostess came by to check on us, we mentioned it and she told us Oh, they've stopped putting curry in the soup but haven't gotten around to changing the menu yet. What?? Well how about telling people when they order it then? Later, our order taker came by to take our plates away so we mentioned it to her as well. She casually admitted that there's no curry and did not apologize at all, did not seem at all concerned that we had not gotten what we had specifically been interested in. (Instead, she chose to tell us how she had to open all by herself that morning and that it had been really busy earlier.) We were polite and did not push the point that she should have told us, though in retrospect, I wish we had. While neither of the staff were at all rude, they also did not have much depth in the customer service department.   I had also ordered the East West salad because the roasted shitake mushrooms sounded yummy. Nope, none in my salad. Geez. Our roasted veggie sandwich was decent (thought it could have been more flavorful but acceptable as a healthy option). The Green Energy shake was tasty albeit sweet and we enjoyed the ginger flavor that was definitely there but was not overpowering.    I had really wanted to like this place; it would be so nice to have a good, healthy, tasty cafe nearby, but sadly, it was not our experience. I sincerely hope the owners read this and take some action because some basic improvement in service and actually delivering what was promised in the food would go a long way towards success as opposed to another restaurant coming and going in this spot...."}
{"text":"So delicious and fresh! Great and healthy choices,  and yummy gluten-free options. Very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I was excited to see they had spring rolls. I asked if they were NOT fried and wrapped in rice paper, and I was told they were.  When they arrived at the table, they were deep fried, in fact everything was deep fried.  How is this considered healthy?  I had a couple of bites before my stomach got queasy; I won't be back.  I gave an extra star for the staff was nice & friendly."}
{"text":"I call this \"Where's the Beef\"  We ordered two sandwiches, a brisket, and a short rib sandwich. Roll was fine, lettuce okay, onions okay,, tomato Okay, but beef was very hard to find. The Fries both regular, and sweet potato were a generous portion, but where's the beef.. No one ever came over to ask how it is.. People were pleasant there. One has to order at the counter, (ugh).  But Where's the beef. Hardly any on the sandwich.  For Almost $20.00 for two sandwiches there should have been plenty of beef."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful atmosphere, reasonably priced and friendly staff. I highly recommend! The hours of operation are the downfall. I want breakfast before 11 a.m. on the weekends. It also closes too early on weekend nights. I live within walking distance and I'd love to walk there with my neighbors/friends weekend mornings or evenings, sip bottomless mimosas, Bloody Mary's or wine, eat a delicious breakfast or dinner, and enjoy conversation."}
{"text":"You  order at the register and seat yourself with a number. Service is great and food was out quick even when it was busy. Light fare with a lots of healthy options. Nice decor also."}
{"text":"I'm always pleasantly surprised by this place. You can find healthy food as well as guilty indulgences on the menu. My daughter and I have come here for lunch and dinner and always seem to make out for $20 or less. Great place to bring family and friends for a casual meal inside or on the patio (misters are going on warm days)."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was awesome! Good food, good service.      Then I went for take away the other day and wow what a disappointment. I'm sad to say that the food was terrible. From the bland turkey burger to the lazily prepared soup to the artificially tasting pastries. The only highlight of the meal were the sweet potato fries and they were mediocre. I officially wasted $24.00 on this so called food. People need to know that the food here is flat out bad before they decide to spend their money and regret it later. Sorry Jacques but you guys got complacent and lazy. Hope you make it back to the days when you tried to impress your patrons."}
{"text":"Hidden lunch spot.  This is the perfect lunch setting including indoor outdoor seating. Customers order at the counter, and items are brought to the table. The food is healthy including vegan and gluten free options, but it actually tastes delicious.  The prices are fair and portions generous.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices...fantastic local eatery!!!! The risotto was awesome and my wife loved the Black Bean sandwich."}
{"text":"Well I wish I had as much time on my hands as the people that gave poor reviews of this place but I have a life.  To start the place is well decorated and the food was great.  Can't beat the price and the service was perfect.  Just go and try it, can't truly have a complaint about this place."}
{"text":"We had a businees mixer here. 35 + attendees. The spread was amazing. I sampled each and every dish and I loved all of them.  I had to take a few boxes home at the end of the night. They set off a side of the restaurant  just for us. Had it been a little cooler, they had an amazing patio they would have been great....but June in Vegas is a bit hot.   Over all...awesome.  Come for lunch, come for dinner, but definitely try Jacques.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice cafeteria featuring fresh organic produce and meats.  Free coffee in the morning.  Gr8 soups, salads and sandwiches.  I like the tofu sandwich.  Nice service and ambience.  Generous servings and reasonable prices.  Gluten free bread that's decent."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The staff is obviously happy to be here. There's a ample wine and beer bar, outdoor seating in Summerlin at Trails Village a couple of doors down from USBank. The food is fresh and priced under $10 to $20. The artwork and the music is smooth and relaxing. Service was perfect!"}
{"text":"Very cute inside and has potential but unfortunately the salad I ordered was not very fresh and had sliced apples on it and the sticker was still on the fruit!! Ahh that's a big no no for me .... Prolly won't be returning:("}
{"text":"Nice decor. The food is bland and super mediocre. Portions are small and overpriced. The menu is odd.  It's a shame because the spot looks great, too bad the food doesn't match. Would love another non-chain spot."}
{"text":"I had the smoked salmon croissant. Fresh  and delicious. Coming back for the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood around 8pm on a Wednesday looking for a spot to get a quick bite and a drink. Seeing as everything seems to close early in the area (even the Stsrbucks we tried first), this was no easy feat.  I finally noticed Cafe Jacques, so we decided to give them a try. They have s number of items on their menu that look tasty. Everything from sandwiches and burgers to soups, salads and small plates.   We each decided on a different burger. I went with the turkey burger with a side salad instead of fries.   You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table when it's ready. We ordered and it wasn't long before our food was ready. My fella opted for the fries with his burger so I got to sampled a few of them along with my meal. The turkey burger was fantastic. Flavorful and well-balanced ingredients. The salad was really good as well. Most side salads are a bit of an afterthought, but the dressing was incredible and the greens were really fresh and crunchy. The fries were great as well. They had the perfect balance and were thin, crispy and well-seasoned. The perfect fry to complement our meal.  Service was incredibly friendly and everyone was very patient with us since we walked in about an hour before they closed and ended up staying til a few minutes after they were scheduled to closed. We made sure they didn't mind and apologized for the inconvenience, which they were very gracious about.  I have to say I wasn't expecting much based on the mixed Yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised by this little shop and looking forward to giving them another visit in the near future."}
{"text":"Good vegan options.  I was able to swap avocado for aloi and the polenta sandwich was excellent."}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday morning. Not very crowded   Nicely decorated, we enjoyed the ambiance and music. The menu said brunch and we were a bit confused thinking the LV buffet trough. But you order off a streamlined me it.  The Benedict had the freshest sauce I've ever tasted. The ham and egg omelet came with potatoes and fresh fruit. Very tasty.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We will have to try lunch and dinner another time."}
