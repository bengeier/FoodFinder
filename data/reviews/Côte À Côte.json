{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Belil/MSH area is located right next to the église Saint Mathieu. Côte à côte (according to their menus) or La Côte (according to their site) is a steakhouse and seafood restaurant that is very comfortable and has a very cozy feel. This is common to more than a few establishments that I have eaten at in the area. I am sure that this is common to the dining culture of Québec.  I have had the benefit of going to Côte à Côte twice. Both times I enjoyed their dinner service. The first time I tried their prime rib. However, on my most recent visit I tried the bavette de boeuf. My appetizer was the saumon tartare. It was not wild-caught but was served with veggies and Sriracha that gave it a welcome, but not overwhelming, bite. Although it is not necessary for me to eat something, it is obvious that they put effort into the presentation of the plate. This effort is always appreciated (I uploaded the pictures of my meal as well as my wife's).  My main course was the bavette (flank steak) which was medium and it had a fantastic flavor. It was cooked how I had asked for it and was delicious.  My dessert was the crème brûlée a la l'orange. The consistency of the cream was perfect even though the top crust was slightly overcooked. Our server was Marie-Helene and she was very professional and attentive and I am always glad to stop by this local gem."}
{"text":"Not impressed.   We have been visiting this restaurant for years, but lately quality has seriously dipped - perhaps ownership has changed - and our last meal was terrible. $40 for a burned filet mignon served with pub fries - terrible. To top it off, when we asked management about it, just in case there was a problem with the chef or something, they told us to get lost - they didn't care we had a horrible meal.   Avoid this restaurant and go next door to Mista - much better food, better service, better price."}
