{"text":"Looking for a cup of coffee, I stumbled on this little out of the way place. Then I tried the crepes--a strawberry and nutella crepe. Wow!! I've become a regular. It is the only place I go for crepes. Its not a typical restaurant--its a one man show, and there isn't a huge selection. But it is such a friendly little place."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe with a limited but sufficient menu. Crepes were delicious (choice of strawberry, banana or blueberry with Nutella), but there's also an assortment of sandwiches (egg salad, tuna salad, etc.). The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed and the coffee was great. We enjoyed it and will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to hear about this quaint place. It's not too obvious from the busy road it faces. I meant friends for brunch there on my first visit recently. It is small and intimate with only a few tables. The menu is not extensive but the choices are not usual fare for a cafe. The barista greeted us warmly and seated us at a small table. We asked that he make some suggestions as it was our first experience in the cafe. His recommendation was a trio of different Crepes for us to share along with choices of hot beverages. It was a delicious combination of sweet and savory crepes. They were all delicate and delicious but I have to say my favorite was the chocolate crepe. And a moment of selfish pleasure I almost wished I had all three of the Crepes to myself! The warm cozy atmosphere was the perfect setting for such a delicious repast. I was very pleasantly surprised when I check was presented because the prices were so reasonable. I have been back several times for coffee or just to pick up something to take home. I am always greeted warmly and find whatever I purchase to be fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Cute little place but out of the 4 things I wanted they only had one. I think management needs to take inventory every night since I went in on a Tuesday probably around 1/1:30 and they were out of so many things. Also maybe prepare small batches of things on their menu, I asked for the chicken soup they told me they had it but it was frozen and would I like them to defrost it...no thank you. This could be a good place in Mint Hill but they need to get it together. I myself won't be going back for the simple fact that I don't want to go down their again if im craving something on their menu for them to tell me they are out."}

{"text":"I came here for the first time today with my wife, and it was quite good. So good, in fact, that I made a page for Irene Cafe just to write a nice review.

Irene Cafe is a little hole-in-the-wall place in Mint Hill. My wife and I both had coffee and Nutella and banana crepes, and we were blown away. The coffee was the best I've had in recent memory. The crepes were huge, perfectly cooked, and delicious. I'm eager to head back and try some of the more savory crepe options.

The menu is a bit confusing for first-timers, as the options for crepes are not clear. It also seemed a bit limited, but that's not a bad thing. My hunch is that this place does a few things and does them well. I plan to return soon and often. If everything is as good as my crepe was today, I'll be adding a star to my review."}
{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful and homie places. I've lived in Mint Hill for most of my life and unfortunately have only recently discovered this place. However, after the first visit I will surely say this is such an amazing discovery! The owner is extremely friendly and OMG the crepes are just AMAZING! They are made fresh right in front of you! And the prices don't hurt your pocket! If you have not yet given this beautiful little cafe a visit, it's a must go ahead and put it on your list. I promise you won't regret it!"}
