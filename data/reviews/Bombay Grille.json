{"text":"Good food by menu but buffet is just worthless. 

My fav is fish pakora and tandoori chicken here worth spending money"}
{"text":"WOW and yummy :)
Reviews are only on Vegetarian dishes.
Best place to be in a group (both friends and family), not very expensive.

Where should I start, one of the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte. I liked the ambiance, not too   Indian style but nice and pleasant. For Vegetarians, we have many options to try and my personal choice will be samosa (It's crispy... go for it). 

Every time we visit,  we make sure we order \"Shahi Makai Dhingri\" ( I would call it their signature dish). It is not hot spicy but it's creamy and very tasty. It goes very well with garlic naan(bread) and other naans. Vegetable pulav (rice) is also very good and it can be served for one person per meal. 

I would recommend you guys to try their Kufi for desserts and halwa was decent (personally it's not up to my mark) but my friends like it.

Side Note : They were about to introduce chocolate samosa. I am not sure about it but just ask them and try if you guys feel having something different."}
{"text":"One of the greatest Indian restaurants in Charlotte. I love coming here for lunch, The best part is they bring fresh none every time, It comes out hot and crispy. Highly recommend this one"}
{"text":"What happened, my beloved Bombay Grille?  Your weekday buffet used to be a mainstay but now it is skimpy - many of the selections are just empty pans, totally not worth it.  Please go back to the way you used to do things so I can return and leave feeling satisfied again...."}
{"text":"Bombay Grille is one of the best Indian restaurants I've eaten at outside of London. And that's saying a lot. Both the meat and plentiful vegetarian dishes were delectable. The nan bread was warm, crispy, and delicious."}
{"text":"Writing this review because I am reminded by the fact that I am not currently at Bombay Grille.  Why the hell am I at work? I do not care if it's 11 AM, that is as good a time as any to be consuming the stunning delish of Bombay Grille.  

I mean like, if you ask for a \"five\" on the spice level they will give you that five.  You will cry and possibly hallucinate.  But man will it be spicy and amazing.  And the nice waiter or waitress will smile at you and give you respect because you know whats really going on.

Nothing in live at the moment is more important than going to Bombay Grille, ordering chicken tikka masala with the garlic naan bread (or a plethora of vegetarian options if that's what i'm down for).

Nothing at all...stop reading and just get in your car or an UBER"}
{"text":"The food was awesome the waiter could have been a little more attentive but all in all great visit."}
{"text":"I frequent this place for take-out as the food is pretty darn good. It's a little expensive for dinner ...takeout for two usually runs us about $55 but its too yummy and their are so few decent Indian restaurants in Charlotte that I deal with it. Portions are not very large. The rice seasoning is particularly good, garlic naan is also fresh and so delicious."}
{"text":"Had a positive experience at Bombay. The food tasted as expected. I had the chicken tikka masala, lamb biriyani, and garlic nan. Everything was tasty, but the garlic nan was phenomenal. I would return."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews here on yelp, we wanted to give this a try. We went here for a lunch buffet on a weekday, had to wait few minutes while the table was made ready. Were somewhat disappointed (probably due to higher expectations). There were hardly any choice in the appetizer selection and very limited options for vegetarian palate. The saving grace was the naan which was continuously served at the table, fresh and warm. The overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing."}
{"text":"We have been dining at BG for several years now and it is still the best all around Indian experience we have found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I restaurant is great and i love their catering services.  If you need a half pan or pan of curry for a party, they have very reasonable prices.  The dishes are filled with paneer, meat, or veggies.  They do not skimp... great way to feed a crowd and keep your kitchen clean.

They also catered my wedding.  I really can't tell you how great they did, especially since they had to make the trip to Columbia, SC for the event. The Indian restaurants in my hometown leave something to be desired, so we went with a Charlotte caterer

We had a tasting at the restaurant, the owner drove down to the site to see the venue and attended the event to make sure everything went well.  The food was perfect, looked great and tasted even better, actually, it tasted even better than the tasting samples.  We were so impressed and everyone said they would be using his restaurant in the future.  

Am I gushing?  

Well, I guess I am, which is really rare for me... its just that through this whole wedding process, you find that it is rare when a company really lives up to their promises.  They did a great job, very professional."}
{"text":"Really good Palak Paneer!!! Not too pricey. Nice looking male waiters. Portions are enough...I finished all of mine. Spicy levels are from 1 to 5, 5 being the hottest. I ordered a 4 and it was perfect! Good Indian food!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Service was great and the overall atmosphere was very nice. I had the lamb madras, with aloo paratha, which went really well with the Taj Mahal Premium beer I was drinking. Overall the food was extremely flavorful and had just the right amount if spice for me, and when I got back my hotel I slept like a baby. Thanks for an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I tried buffet lunch here and the food was average and pricey for what was served. The ambience was not so great...the guy who had us seated did not even have a smile on his face and I thought it was very rude, maybe he had a bad day. Don't think I will go back there again."}
{"text":"Great food!! I highly recommend this place. It was so flavorful and really enjoyed their naan."}
{"text":"Worst indian food I have ever eat in US.  

If you read my review I bet you that you will regret if you give a try to this place. 
it's a joke of indian food. I have been eating paneer kadhai from 20 years and I know how it should taste. It was horrible. first time I went for dine in and the food was horrible , customer service was awful.  After 6 month we taught we will do take out order and will order something else than we ordered last time. I honestly thrown it in garbage as I felt horrible taste and smell in food. I didn't wanted to go sick after eating that."}
{"text":"2nd time we have been to this restaurant and it was great!  The service was good the food was great!  They will alter the food to how spicy you like it.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food -- Surprisingly inappropriate & appalling service. 

I have never had a bad experience at Bombay grille, as far as food is concerned. However, last Sunday (2/26/17) my boyfriend went to pick up our food for take-out, and was made to feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable by the 2 women working the register. As, I too, find him to be a very attractive man, I'm never surprised or annoyed by flirtatious attempts from other women. 

But while waiting for the food (after asking him to speak Spanish for them, and complimenting his accent/skin tone/eye color), one of these two young ladies working asked if he had \"ever been with a black girl\" -- following which the second girl asked \"well have you ever been with a white girl?\" -- Feeling uncomfortable, he left his reply short stating he has a girlfriend, picked up his food and left.  

In an effort to not publicly lambast Bombay Grille, we have tried to contact the owner or manager. Unfortunately, no one will answer the phone, you cannot leave a voice mail, and the Emergency contact number provided does not allow us to reach anyone. 

Again, great food. But we won't be returning thanks to this highly inappropriate service."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! There is always great food on the buffet. Great for take out or dine in. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Needed an Indian food fix, my friend is 6 months pregnant and craving Indian food,so went here as it was the closest at the time, It was pretty good, I had the chicken Tikka Masala and some kind of yummy Korma. My friend really liked the dessert which was some kind of fruit pudding, I myself would rather have Kheer,Ras Malie or that Indian dessert that is made out of carrots not sure of the name
However 
I really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka and the Korma. And I felt the service was great especially since we had a toddler with us , the waiter was so friendly and helpful with the toddler,  and I was impressed by that and the fact that he kept our water glasses filled and had a smile on his face the whole time. Super friendly service... A++ service . I will definitely be back. The only thing I think needs improvement is keeping the buffet re-stocked.  That is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I dropped into this place for lunch, when they had a buffet.  The food was ok, if limited in choice, but the service mediocre.  Like in the buffet, they had, among other things, tandoori chicken, of which I took a few pieces, just freshly in.  I got the first serving of naans, and had to wait a bit between finishing the first basket and  getting the second.  By then, the chicken had gotten cold.  As for the naans, they were flat, and some slightly crispy, instead of soft.  The tamarind chutney was okay.

In terms of drinks, they are surprisingly limited - only mango lassi/sweet lassi or the sodas.  No fresh lime sodas (lemonade variants) that one would expect from an Indian place

Conclusion: might be worth trying out for a la carte meals, but certainly not the buffet."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Indian  food I have ever had in USA. Went there for Sunday buffet and the food was terrible. Serving is bad and avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the Saturday lunch buffet. The spread is average, quality of food and service unimpressive.
First time I have seen okra cooked without even taking off the tops.
Overpriced & overrated"}
{"text":"Very good service, food was very well cooked, taste was okay. Served even after closing time."}
{"text":"The food is hardly indian. Its as spicy as cookie dough. Its as if there is sugar in every dish. I guess the sugar in the food makes up for the lack of desserts offered with the buffet. The paneer dish as well as one of the chicken dishes had the same masala gravy which was extremely sweet. The chaat dish was mushy and uninspired. The chicken fried rice dish had almost inedibly tough chicken.
To top it off the restaurant does not understand the concept of keeping the buffet food hot. Atleast the music was not intrusive and there was no tvs in the dining area as in other less than acceptable establishments. The service was polite but not very frequent.
When it comes to authentic indian food, this doesn't count. Get some real indian chefs and don't try to adapt the food to the location of its patrons. You might then stand a chance.

1 Star."}
{"text":"Saw a huge roach on the wall. Mentioned it to my waiter who grabbed it with a napkin and said they are attracted by the Indian spices. Saw another on the booth. Called the manager who looked dumbfounded at it. Said I would pay for the bottle of wine we ordered, but not the food we hadn't received yet. No apologies or comment as we were paying the bill."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. Nearly Authentic Northern Indian Cuisine. Palak Paneer is THE BEST!!! I go here every year for my Birthday."}
{"text":"I was in Pineville last week and didn't want to drive around so decided to eat at this restaurant but they don't have consistence. I ordered Lamb Rogan and it was just with tomato gravy with few pieces of lamb. Your chef if you have one should learn how to cook this kind of dish and then charge $17. No one came to asked how was the dish or if I need anything else. I had been here few times due to convenient to my work but that's it."}
{"text":"My friend and I went last night to Bombay Grille. We started with samosa (she ordered and oh boy what a good choice). They are very filling and come as two big pieces. I ordered chicken palak. It's quite tasty but a little spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was very prompt in refilling my drink. The garlic naan was sooo yummy! I can eat that for dinner with the sauce of Chicken Palak. I wish this place only 10 minutes away from my home..."}
{"text":"I love Bombay Grille! I have tried several other Indian restaurants in the south Charlotte area and I always end up back to Bombay Grille. I highly recommend the mutter paneer and palak paneer. I have never had any issues with takeout and the food is always warm. Their spice level is also on point. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are both great.  Any dish you get will be unique and flavorful.  My favorite is the chicken vindaloo.  Be careful the vindaloo is extremely spicy.  They also have a fairly extensive lunch buffet worth checking out."}
{"text":"Unhygienic, wonder how they got a 95.0 on the sanitation score. 
Buffet counter was cramped and dirty with food spilt. 
Food was okay, naan was great and  so were the lamb curry and bhindi masala. Tandoori chicken was dry and had no flavour or taste."}
{"text":"Excellent Biryani excellent chicken Masala and simply everything else you may order.

I have been dining there for over 10 years.
The flavor is just like dining in India.
I love the quality of chicken they use.
Also the Samosa, Garlic Naan and the Tandoori is awesome.
( I have visited most Indian cuisines in Charlotte and Bombay is a Classic. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"We had a GoPlaySave coupon for The Bombay Grille and decided to give it a try tonight. So, so glad we did. 

The food was delicious.  Awesome service. Nice environment.  No hassle at all using the coupon. 

No complaints at all. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, and this place used to be my favorite.  But starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill. We tried it again recently and sadly I won't try again for quite a while. The pakoras lacked flavor, like something microwaved. The entrees were very disappointing -- Chicken Palak was the worst I've had anywhere. Bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite. Hopefully the food returns to its prior quality someday soon."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time on 1/21/2012 with a Groupon!

Atmosphere was nice, dark with lots of recessed lighting, you could definitely go casual or dress fancy and be in place with either. The service was really good, fairly quick to take your order and bring out plates. Plus, they had a waitress constantly refilling your glass of water (which can be a blessing at an Indian restaurant if you accidentally order something to spicy for your taste!)

Half of the menu was vegetarian, thumbs up for that!!

I was impressed that they immediately bring out a complimentary plate of very thin flat bread and chutneys as soon as you're seated. We ordered the veg sampler appetizer, which was pretty good. I definitely preferred the paneer pakoras and cauliflower pakoras over the samosas. I ordered the malai kafta as my main course, good. Garlic naan and paneer bread were very impressive.

I enjoyed Bombay Grille, but it doesn't top the quality of food at Woodlands... I'm forever spoiled."}
{"text":"Great Indian food with reasonable prices. Lunch buffet is very good but just need to keep the naan stocked. I enjoy eating at Bombay Grille regularly :)"}
{"text":"Great consistent quality of food & service. The lunch buffet is perfect for begginers in the Indian food genre. Very clean & pleasant decor."}
{"text":"The service was GREAT.  The food was AMAZING. The facility was neat and clean. All the food was FRESH.  The temperature was a Litton little cool.  Not sure if it was because of the location of the door and it was cold outside.   Will eat there many times over when I am in town."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is probably one of the better Indian meals in Charlotte.  Dinner can get a bit pricey.  Service is adequate.  Atmosphere is better than most Indian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The service is a highlight. But the rice tastes... plastic-y to me. The paneer is very bland compared to what I've had at other restaurants. It left me missing Bombay Cuisine and wanting to try the Turkish restaurant across the parking lot. The sauces were really tastey and they do a good job of adjusting the heat up or down according to tolerance. The garlic naan seemed really thick- which could've been a fluke because I don't remember it ever being like that before. I've been here about 5 times.  Nice atmosphere, nice service, tastey samosas (on the hot side!!!).

Here's the deal- I would go here if that's where my friends wanted to go (which is what happened last week). But I would not choose to go otherwise when there are two other Indian restaurants that I enjoy so much more."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Indian restaurant. The food is always good, even if you do have to wait a bit for it. Friendly service every time."}
{"text":"Tried takeout yesterday. One of the worst Indian meals we have had in a long time.
- Lamb Kabobs - undercooked and falling apart. They may have run out of time or maybe they had too many takeout orders. No excuse. A big F for this.
- Chicken Makhni - C minus. tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish. Very small portion. 
- Saag Paneer - C+ The paneer tasted rubbery. Good flavor though.

One can understand, this is Charlotte and thus not a Indian food destination. But the miss on simple Kabobs clearly show a careless staff. Charlotte deserves better.

In my opinion, a waste of money."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic, but I'm not quite sure the food is worth the price tag. If I order take out for two for dinner, usually the bill runs about $30. Again, dining in is great, the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. There's nothing exceptional about their dishes - and it doesn't taste any better or worse than any other Indian food I've had. 

If you ask me, the private owners of these little, ethnic restaurants charge way too much for their food. Even the Thai places I've been to in Charlotte are expensive."}
{"text":"I had buffet lunch here yesterday. I went after 2 p.m. There was no tandoori chicken and they did not refill it till 3 p.m. By that time I had already finished my lunch. The naan bread was like a rubber sheet. They never bothered to refill the bread basket. The food was below average. The chicken curry was passable. Chicken tikka masala was below average. They had aloo gobi with uncooked cauliflower, I guess the dish got empty and they tried to refill it by throwing some half sauteed cauliflowers. Biriyani was a joke. I have tried most of the Indian restaurants in Charlotte and  I would rate this as the second worst. The only thing they bothered to refill was water. I will never return to this place and I will not recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"No, I haven't been to India. No, I'm not going to india, YES, I love indian food! This is one of the top indian restaurants in Charlotte. I've only ever eaten their buffet ($9.95 weekday) and thats just fine with me. I love to try a little bit of all the different flavors, and then wash it all down with a mango lassi. If you live anywhere in South Charlotte, its worth trying. It isn't a fancy place (if that's what you are looking for), but it's fine, and the food is why I keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth going.The food served does not anywhere tastes likes Indian.

If you are looking for an Indian Taste, please avoid BG."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken korma!! We tried the samosas also- delish!! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Please invest some money in replacing the filthy carpets and increasing quality staff. The wait was long, the service was slow, the standards of the establishment have lowered so much that its only worth a pick up service."}
{"text":"Loved the buffet. Food and service was great. Egg masala was my favorite. Place was also clean."}
{"text":"Good Indian food is hard to come by, in most cases. Charlotte has quite a few options and I'm happy to say that Bombay Grille has stolen the spotlight for me. 

I had heard great things and read all of the shining reviews they had to date. I was pleased to find a very humble dining room, complete with appropriate music. I love me some Indian tunes!

We started out with the standard pappadaam cracker bread. Very brittle and filled with flavorful spices. All three dips/sauces were choice. Fresh, pungent and never lacking in flavor or interest. 

Next, pakoras. These little fried bundles of joy make something as boring as cauliflower AWESOME. An assortment of lightly fried and seasoned veggies, dusted with cumin. Tender, flavorful and intriguing. Worth every penny. 

Then, garlic cheese naan. If you don't get this, you're missing out. Awesome flavors. A perfect marriage of textures as well. If you have some of the sauces left over from you pappadaam, USE THEM. All work with the naan and rather well, I might add. 

Entrees. My wife had the Palak Paneer. Green and savory sauce. Filled with fresh herbs and chalk full of hefty chunks of fresh, house-made paneer (Indian Cheese). Tofu-ish texture and perfect for topping on your rice or MORE naan. I'd get this dish and I'm not even a vegetarian. 

I had the Lamb Korma. Dude, I love me some lamb. They do this up RIGHT. Tons of flavors swirling around a hilarious amount of steamed rice. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this dish. Other than when it was all gone. *tear*

Service was top notch. Get ready for some contestant visits from your server(s). They'll upsell you a lot, too. Always will ask if you want more of....EVERYTHING. 

Price is very reasonable as well. Me made it out under $50 for the two of us. 

If you're in Pineville and looking for some ethnic, culinary greatness, Bombay is the dankness.

These guys do quite a bit of couponing as well. Seen quite a few around these parts. Also, they do FoodieCall. Get that stuff delivered! BOOM!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm teetering between a 3 and 4...but I choose a 4 and I'll tell you why in a second.

I came with friends a few Sundays ago and I fell in love with this type of buffet-I generally equate buffets with Golden Corral and run the other way.  For a newbie to Indian food, its great to be able to try a little bit of everything.  If you love food that uses a variety of spices in unusual combinations (not necessarily spicy as in hot), Bombay Grille provides a nice introduction to Indian food.

The buffet is small-ish and usually has several chicken dishes-butter chicken, curried chicken, and chicken vindaloo among others.  The sauces are out-of-this-world delicious and even the paneer (Indian tofu) has a bouncy texture.  The buffet includes fresh naan brought to your table, which you can dip in the delicious sauces from the entrees.  They have a strange looking dish that is chopped spinach, mint, and chickpeas-looks like baby poo but tastes delicious!  

The reason that this place deserves 4 stars is the mango custard desert.  It is creamy. delicious, and helps cool off my over-spiced American palate after a spicy meal.  I would bathe in this stuff if I could!!!  Be sure to save room for dessert.  

Tip: The Sunday buffet is more expensive ($12), so try it during the week if you're budget-conscious."}
{"text":"Extremely dissapointing trip here. Service was average to bad. Food quality left a lot to be improved. Currys have no meat but curry. Taste wise it isn't great either. I make far better indian food at home. Meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy. Overall I don't recommend it and won't be going back at all. Oh yeah their carpets were dirty with food everywhere,seems like they don't vacuum at all or very little."}
{"text":"All around mediocre experience. The app was slow to come out. The lamb roganjosh was under-spiced and the lamb was tough. Disappointing first Indian experience in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I must say, I went in for the buffet but I couldn't help myself but to actually order from the menu.  I really wanted a sense of what the food and service was like fresh.  I came in my waiter asked what u would like to drink, he filled my glass then I notified him I would be ordering from a menu.  He was very very pleasent, promptly brought me a menu and u ordered my favorite from back home, chicken Tikka masala and garlic naan.  Yes basic, but absolutely delish.    Lots of sauce for dipping, chicken was abundant, tender and juicy.  My glass was never empty or in danger of being empty.  Nice surroundings.   I cannot wait to go back.  This resaurant deff hit the spot"}
{"text":"This is place serves the worst Indian Food.  The food is tasteless and Naan was very hard to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant had been recommended to me many times and while my Aunt was visiting for the holidays we decided to try it. I will honestly say my experience with Indian food is fairly limited but I LOVED Bombay Grille!  We ordered the Samosas, garlic naan, chicken korma, and chicken vindaloo. I love spicy so we got level 4 on the korma and the waiter warned me the vindaloo was very hot. I have to admit the vindaloo was super hot lol... It was amazingly good but it did make my eyes water at first. The korma was a perfect 4 and was very good! As for the naan an samosas, I was in heaven both were awesome. The rice was okay (seemed a little under cooked) And that was my Only negative. We also ordered 2 masala chai teas and my aunt was impressed said it was the best she's had! All in all this was a fantastic experience, the staff was attentive and helpful and I will be back very soon to try more of their dishes and their lunch buffet!!"}
{"text":"Delightful food and service! One of my friends was visiting from out-of-town and we were wanting an authentic and comfortable dining experience. Bombay Grille fit the craving and made for a relaxing night out. 

Once we ordered we realized that they were running a Living Social deal. Within minutes and a couple quick swipes of the finger, we snagged the deal. Bonus. We ordered a side of naan, the vegetarian mutter paneer and the chicken tikka masala, both level 2 spicy. The spice definitely packs a punch, so if you are sensitive, then don't go above a 1! Very delicious, generous portions.

Service was attentive. Each staff hustles to get tables served, waters filled, leaving patrons full and happy. 

If you are craving quality Indian cuisine in a humble atmosphere, this is your place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Bombay Grille for a filling and satisfying Indian dinner. I love the chili naan and the samosas they offer and they have a large menu that has traditional Indian food as well as an Indo-Chinese section on the menu. I have also been there numerous times for their lunch buffet (more on the weekends so gather up some buds and go during the work week). The buffet has never been totally the same and you can get in and get out fast, even though I dont mind hanging there smelling in all the goodness. Enjoy!

http://www.bombaygrille.com/charlottemenu.html"}
{"text":"OMGosh! That was the best Indian cuisine I have had in a very long time!  I usually try a little of everything on the buffet before I commit to one, but the Tikka Marsala, Tandoori Chicken and Goat Curry...  yuuummmm! A scandalous love triangle"}
{"text":"Even though I have earlier commented on the costliness of their meals, I have to say that their food is very good, eating-wise.

Their chicken tikka masala  is tasty.  The sauce alone is a meal over their nice rice.  Not much chicken, but it really is the sauce anyway.

So with the naan bread.  They have the tandoor oven so the bread is cooked with some char and retains its soft texture.  Naan for dipping is excellent.

When calling in for a take out order, they tell you 20 minutes, but apparently they do not start cooking your order until after you arrive and have paid in advance.  Their phone rings continually, as there are many who order take-out.  Four people were waiting with me last night who had called in.  All of us had been told 20 minutes and it took that amount of time or longer to actually get your order once in the door.

Not many happy campers last night.

So...sit down is better with your time than take-out.  Remember to order a bit more so you will leave satisfied.  And if calling in an order to-go, expect to wait at least 20 minutes before you can leave."}
{"text":"Thank you so much Vicky you are such a great waiter! You gave me a great experience patient kind and humble. He even gave me some extra. I hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few of times over the years with mixed results; however, on a recent lunch trip our party of six immediately turned around and left after seeing their latest 87.5 sanitation score. I'm continually shocked at how some restaurants are able to stay in business in spite of repeatedly posting low sanitation scores. I suppose some customers just don't notice or don't care. Well THIS one does (as do many of my readers) and will not return."}
{"text":"Took my family here and had a terrible experience. We started with an assortment of Indian breads and the Pakora appetizer which wasn't cooked through (sticky batter in center). Whole place was empty, yet it took 45 mins for four entrees to arrive. Waiter got one order wrong and was apologetic but then it took another 25 mins for the correct dish to arrive, and when it did it was missing the side it was supposed to come with. Only flavorful thing on the entire table was the palak paneer. Still, I've had far better elsewhere. Nothing about our experience was positive. Well- maybe the ample parking. Otherwise, it was a total waste of $100. All four of us agreed as we were walking out that we would never go back."}
{"text":"Went here Easter Sunday the food was amazing. I had the buffet which served curry goat, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, grilled fish, byrani veg/chicken, and dessert. There were more dishes but that's all I can remember. My taste buds thanked me. The staff was super courteous. I will revisit."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and waited around 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant has a very rundown look to it. The carpets were all dirty black and the tables were from hundreds years ago. The menu had a hair in it, silverware wasn't clean and overall I got a very unhygienic vibe. The food was a turnoff as well. The bread basket was quite disappointing and so was the chicken tikka masala which is their signature dish. Chicken peices were very hard to break and kadai paneer was the worst I have ever had. No reason for me to give this place a second try."}
{"text":"Great service for the price point. friendly, helpful staff. Great authentic taste and presentation. Some safe choices available for those unaccustomed to Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"By far, the Best Indian food in the Queen City. Bombay Grille makes everything from scratch and you can taste the freshness when you order off the menu. They also don't skimp on ingredients. Great food, great service, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet. While there wasn't too much of a variety for the buffet I thought the food was delicious. Will be back for dinner one night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! I loved every bite of food! The naan bread is perfect, the Samosa appetizer is incredible, and my Panak Paneer was sooo creamy, spicy, and delicious. The wait staff is so friendly, attentive and makes the experience even better. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a 3 but could be a 4 stars.  The ambience leaves a lot to be desired.  The venue is old and the age shows.  The staff, while friendly, is not very prompt.  We had to wait a while after we were done eating to get checked on.  The assorted pakoras were terrible - very bland and not fried well.  The entrees were solid.  Chicken Tikka was good and perfectly spiced.  The mutter paneer with methi was nice as well.  The naan and garlic naan were warm and were good portions.  The rice was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Reasons I will never go to this restaurant again:

-Out of all the empty tables, the waiter (a creepy, older man) sat me at the table against a wall right next to the door, pretty much isolated and alone.

-The waiter tried to find out where I was from (my ethnicity), where I lived, whether I was working that day and whether I was on my lunch break, whether I was married, and whether I lived alone or with my parents. 

-When I was getting food from the lunch buffet, my waiter would pop up from behind me and point to the last dish I got and say \"This, very good.\"

-When the waiter had nothing to do at the moment, he'd stand against the wall across the room and just stare at me. 

I felt extremely uncomfortable there, and the buffet was not worth its price."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. I ordered samosas as an app and they were full of potato, very dry and were accompanied by some yellowed spinach leaves. My main was lamb rogan josh. very little meat, the
sauce was bland and tasteless. the place was not busy but service was slow. the place was clean and there was no sign of the dirty carpet mentioned in some other reviews, however i will not be going back"}
{"text":"I've heard that this place serves great Indian curries. I especially enjoyed the Malai Kofta. The Kulchas and Naans were great too. The Tandoori Kabab, not so great. Won't be ordering that again. Service is good and waiters r very friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Indian spot. The location or ambiance won't blow you away but the food is spot on! Tried a few different items and never had anything I didn't Like! The servers are all very nice and attentive. I'd rather eat here than at Copper (or other popular Indian spots) any day of the week."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised.  I've traveled to India many times and make it a point to go to Indian restaurants when I travel to other cities in the US, so I've developed a bit of a taste for Indian food. I was not expecting much, I suppose due to its location and ubiquitous name, but the food was excellent (relative to other Charlotte Indian restaurants). 

We got takeout on a Sunday night (another reason why my expectations were not super high) and once we got home, I could immediately tell we had potential. The chicken biryani was very good, perhaps not traditional, but its very hard to get good biryani in any restaurant around town and this was about as good as we've had so far.  The chicken tikka was also very good - not overly creamy and thick, but not too thin and with just the right taste - not all \"doctored\" up like some places like to do. Simple, yet right on point.

All in all, very good.  I'm rethinking my top Indian restaurants in town after this experience. Bombay Grille now goes towards the top. I gave it a 4 just because I tend to give my 5s to those rare places that I think were absolutely exceptional. I have not found a \"5\" among the Indian restaurants here in town yet."}
{"text":"The food is not real Indian food, everything they made for native people. If you really looking for tasty, spicy Indian food this place is not worth it. On all food items are sweet and more creamy.
This is place is not meant for real \"INDIAN FOOD LOVERS\""}
{"text":"I've been eating here for year during dinner hours. Decided to try their lunch buffet. It had plenty of meat and vegetarian options. The food was seasoned goof but nothing was heavly spicy. I did miss the spice thou. When order a single meal I also order extra spicy and they do exactly that! My nose will be running LOL. I recommend trying there buffett."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good, and each time I come here, I order a different take on a lamb dish.  I've never had their chicken, fish, or veggie offerings, just lamb.

The service is attentive, and the place is dark and nice.

My favorite is the cheese and garlic naan.  This probably isn't a real, traditional Indian side order, but it is nonetheless very delicious.  

For their lamb dishes, I always order a 5-level spiciness, and even at that level, I find it to be rather non-spicy.  That's ok though, because I am really ordering it for the lamb.

There is however one BIG COMPLAINT I have about this restaurant:  The servers always, always upsell.  What I mean is, they always ask if you want to order more, an appetizer? dessert?  alcohol?  I KNOW this is a common practice to get a higher bill, but seriously, I am an adult, and I know what my caloric intake should be.  I suppose white America is all about excess, and ordering tons of food.  Anyway, stop upselling!  I can afford to eat out a lot, I just don't like wasting food."}
{"text":"Loved the lamb madras and the Peshawar Nann. The lamb was cooked well with just the right amount of spices. The peshawar nann was something I never had before. It was filled with shredded coconuts, cherries and cashew nuts."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Its a general rule that you can judge the authencity of ethnic restaurants by the number of patrons that match the ethnicity of the food. This place is always packed with people of Indian descent. I definitely recommend the chicken tikka masla. It's always good and you can tell them how spicy you want it. Easily the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Have tried this place a couple of times. Service is good, the servers genuinely try to take care of you.
The food is not up to the mark. Everything literally tastes the same.
The Sunday lunch buffet is pretty devoid of options. They had custard for desert!"}
{"text":"Despite the atmosphere (not too inviting), and unfortunately the slow service, the food was actually good.  This appears pretty consistent as I read the reviews before trying it out with the family."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet. I went at 1:30pm. Si I only had a hour to eat. They didn't have a wide selection of food. Perhaps because it was close to it being closing time. Hence the 3 stars. Even the taste of the food was not so good like the other Indian buffets. You cloud say it was bland. Nothing had a punch of flavor. I guess it's a good place to go in a pinch. But go early and maybe they will have more selections"}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting Bombay Grille for lunch. We went with no real feedback and just an open mind. The waiters were super friendly and walked us through each item on the buffet. They also advised us of the spice levels. My coworker can go through a whole pitcher of water and our waiter was ready in stand-by mode with a fresh pitcher!  Ha!  The food was so fresh and had just the right amount of spice level. The okra was my favorite item and I asked how they made it. I don't think I'm capable of replicating this without a recipe . To top off our visit, the waiter went above and beyond with our bill and accepted a coupon that was supposed to be for dinner. I promised I'd be back and I will!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Bombay Grille. The buffet had a wide selection and the flavor was second to none. Eaten Indian cuisine all over the world and Bombay Grille is one of the best. The staff were very friendly and courteous, and the price - wow - exceptional - looking forward to tasting their A La Carte -Awesome!"}
{"text":"Dinner from the menu is leaps and bounds better than the buffet at lunch. Otherwise pretty good Indian food. Love the staple Indian dish, chicken tikka masala. The naan is great too.

The staff James good. They're very attentive and the restaurant decor is great. Indian restaurants are known for their lunch buffet. I enjoyed dinner at BG but the restaraunt's buffet wasn't great so I couldn't give it 5 stars. I actually debated giving it 3, but ordering from the menu will result in a great experience, so I will go with a 4. 

Also, while the atmosphere is definitely kid friendly, almost all of the buffet options are fairly spicy, too spicy for almost all kids. I love spicy food so I enjoyed it and it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy for me and wouldn't be for most adults. Again, when you order from the menu, this is not an issue. 

Cooper on East Blvd is a great Indian cuisine option."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet. Everything we tried was delicious. The service was excellent, the location is great. 5 stars all around. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch buffet. Not too crowded. Good mix of food and selections. Good was hot and fresh. Tandoori chicken was good!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food in town. If you want fresh, quality flavorful dinner then go to Bombay Grille. Wether a vegetarian or carnivore you will not be disappointed. Everything has the flavor that will put a smile on your face. We ordered 4 dishes and shared family style. After taking a bite of the first dish I said that's my favorite. Then the next was my favorite. Then the last two were also my fav. We've tried everything on the menu. You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"The buffet has all of my favorites & is delicious. The curry chicken, biryani chicken & jambhar soup were stand outs. Some items are on the spicy side. 

Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Food taste was not good. I felt like vegetables were added to standard gravy. Manager over there is rude (he talks very nice with wh*te people)."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it less. Will be disputing the bill with my Amex. Ridiculous is how to best describe the buffets. This is the third and last time!!! I'm one for giving someone an extra chance or two but with only 10 items on the menu they were consistently out of more than half the entire time we were there. When you think of India you think spices. This place has done an Amazing job of including none of them. Cold, bland and that's even if you get to see some food. Had a friend with me that was a vegetarian and could only eat one item at a time as they kept running out of stuff. Again only 10 items on the buffet and it wasn't even busy with people. Only 4 other 2 person tables there. I only wish I had taken a picture of the buffet to prove it. If you can read this. Don't say I didn't tell you so. Anyway I'm sure they will be closed soon."}
{"text":"We gave this a try while in the area. Overall really good. We had simosas which you could tell were fresh and really good. My husband had vindaloo and I had tiki Marsala. Usually vindaloo comes with dark meat and they did white here which was awesome. We prefer that and some places won't even substitute. Was really good. My tiki was great as well, very creamy and decent portion. Add in the naan and overall we enjoyed our meals. Service was a little slow for a week night but would come again."}
{"text":"Many consider Bombay Grille the best Indian restaurant in town (not saying much), but I have to disagree.  If this place was in NYC, San Francisco, LA, or any other big city with a larger Indian demographic, it would not succeed (IMHO).  But in a city with limited options for Indian cuisine, many people like it because they don't know any better.  Or they eat at B.G. because there's really not a lot of better options.

Bombay Grille is more authentic than most Indian joints around town, but definitely isn't \"the real deal\".  If this place was in a big city I'd give it one star.  But everything is relative in life so I'll give em two."}
{"text":"Bombay Grille has excellent chicken korma. Their weekday lunch buffet has really tasty food as well. You can find authentic tandoori chicken , an assortment of curries, sauces, rice, fruity, and vegetarian options. Their naan is pretty awesome as well. What I really like is that their staff are very friendly and knowledgeable! Their prices are very reasonable too. Great place!"}
{"text":"The best place for Indian food in Charlotte. I tried lamb briyani, gobi lasanwala, naan, chicken tikka. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Went during dinner and asked to make the food spicy. The food came with lots of red chili powder, the only thing I could taste was the chili. Besides that, the environment was friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have ever tasted and the service is great too. I always get the Chicken Korma extra spicy with Naan bread. The staff takes great care of you and takes pride in this place. I love the buffet too which has almost everything from the menu on it. Please give this place a chance. They get two thumbs up for perfect satisfaction."}
{"text":"The veg biryani here is the truth!!!!!it's the best I've had amongst various veg biryanis I've had here charlotte n I been to nearly every single  indian restaurant in town. My mom is a legit bona-fide biryani specialist n this thing is the closest it gets to hers!! I will definitely get it again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this Indian buffet. Everything taste so delicious and I literally feel like I could taste every single spice in the food. I tried a dessert that was a mango pudding, or similar to that consistency, it was actually incredible! The service is great. But the best part is the naan bread! I am addicted to naan and Indian food."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte! The food and service are excellent."}
{"text":"We ordered take away for dinner. Our order was ready within 20 minutes.  I had the lamb korma and my boyfriend had the seek kabobs. It was delicious and there was plenty of food. The only complaint is the price,  it is a little expensive... however,  we don't get take away often so it was worth it.  We'll definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday for the lunch buffet and arrived around 1120am. When my roommate and I first got there, we were the only patrons there!  I thought perhaps we were early, but throughout our meal only one other table with two customers were there and when they left a mother and daughter came in towards the end of our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, he came to refill our waters twice.  Other than that we really didn't see him.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection. There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day's buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.

Normally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.  Their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate.  After leaving the restaurant I took a nap and very long walk afterwards, and I still was full to the point of being uncomfortable.  I am grateful that I did not have to work that day, I would have been miserable.  I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.  Food has never made me feel that way.  

Key points that I was disappointed in were:
1. Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here.
2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here.
3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL
4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I'd hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full.
5. Where were the spices? It's bad enough that there wasn't any good curry or paneer, but I couldn't taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL
7. Naan- didn't taste like it was homemade.. looked and tasted like store bought and it was plain.. they didn't have garlic naan!  By the time I had some, it was cold, chewy and blah.  No ghee and naan!  No spices or raisin and naan.  NOT SATISFIED!
6. The price for the selection. - FAIL

The decor is slightly plain.. the only redeeming quality was what I was craving for over a month since moving to Charlotte.. a Mango Lassi.

Overall, I would not return to this restaurant.. the food quality, selection and price were less than stellar.  I've heard great things about \"Passage to India\" in the University area and can't wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested by a friend who is from Bangladesh. This is one of the best restaurants we have been too. We not once had an empty glass while we were being waited on & the buffet was fresh. The staff were very friendly & we almost felt as if we were relatives of the people working there. I would most definitely recommend this Indian restaurant. Did I mention that everything is reasonably priced for the area???"}
{"text":"I love this place great atmosphere the servers are very friendly and very courteous. The food speaks for it self very tasty. All the breads are great. The lentil popadom is Very tasty. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Hired #BombayGrille to cater for my daughter's wedding because this business was the preferred caterer for #BentonConventionCenter in Winston-Salem and recommended by them. Food tasted very well. To my dismay, the quantity for biryani and kabobs turned out to be very short despite the fact that the number of guests who showed up were less than the number paid for. This was very embarrassing for me and the only sore point during my daughter's wedding. Bride, groom and the guests at the back of the line didn't get food. I was later told by some friends that they had encountered food shortage at another wedding where food was catered by #Bombaygrille. Unfortunately I found this out too late. I would not recommend them to hire for an important event such as a wedding."}
{"text":"I teeter between 3 and 4 stars on this review but I decided to be nice :)

We almost missed it because the \"bomb\" on their sign is not lit up so it says \"AY GRILLE\"  currently.  That almost turned me away.  I have this weird stigma with restaurants or shops that have half a sign lit up without fixing it.  It just seems so bootleg.  But, I pressed on...

Atmosphere--
Not much to write home about, a little dingy, a little 70's/80's with the mirrors and lighting, rather small so we were literally on top of another party, etc.

Service--They seemed super busy or way understaffed.  A 10 year old little boy sat us but then we didn't see another soul for at least 15 minutes.  No drink order, no greeting, no wine list, nothing.  So, that was really weird.  When the waiter finally approached us we asked for a wine list but that was the wrong thing to do because he ended up pulling his disappearing act again.  We noticed there was a party of 8 that must have been sat RIGHT before us so we just got their sloppy leftovers.  Was it bad that I was glaring at the party and that I was thinking to myself they have SOME nerve coming up in there taking over the joint?  haha...  When the server was ready to take our order he literally looked like he was breaking a sweat.  I totally get it, I have served tables before so I sorta felt bad for him.  However, that didn't prevent me from noticing that we had been there for an hour with nothing to show for.  

**they were REALLY good about refilling waters though.  

The Food---the food was their saving grace.  I am pretty much giving them 4 stars based on the food alone.  I thought it was really good.  The garlic naan was so fresh, the chicken korma was cooked to perfection, and had just the perfect amount of flavor, the rice was done well, etc.  The only thing is that there wasn't very much chicken in the tikki masala--just a few big chunks so hubby left hungry.  I also found the masala sauce to be too pastey...it was like a spaghetti sauce in a way.  But, it was good.

I'm not holding the bad service against them.  I clearly came on an \"off\" night.  If the big oversized party wasn't dominating the whole restaurant then it would have been a much more pleasant experience.  So, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will return if they get the sign fixed ;)"}
{"text":"Decent lunch buffet...a little larger choice selection would have been good, but not bad overall."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Bombay Grille for more than 6 years now.  It never fails to surprise me every time that I pull into the place that it somehow keeps the lights on and stays in business.  

Now let me be clear, I'm surprised it stays in business because every time I go there for lunch, it's dead.  Shocking really at any buffet, but especially at a buffet where the food is as good as it is here.  

It's really really good.  The naan is fresh, the Chicken Kormi and chicken curry are delicious.  Any time they serve lamb, consider yourself lucky - it's amazing.  

To top it off, they often have rice pudding available to finish off the destruction of your blood sugar.  It's great!  The only problem is that it usually has to sit on top of two plates of delicious food and soup which means your stomach is about to overflow.  

The service is also respectable, and it seems as though the same 4 or 5 guys are always working, so if you're a regular, they'll recognize you.  

The only reason it's not a 5 star place is the decor and cleanliness.  I'm not saying its dirty, but it's not sparkling, and the dimly lit dining room doesn't bestow confidence in germaphobes.  

I would however recommend this place to any foodie type who knows that sometimes you have to look past some of the details to find the gems."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the service was excellent, the ambience is very pleasant, and the restaurant is in a convenient location. Will definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bombay grill what's with this chili paneer ? I ordered dinner and appetizer to go.. and I received one.. but too poor to say that.. very disappointed with the chili paneer- it's 5 pieces of paneer and not at all good quality..i felt that it's leftover paneer packed in the to go box.."}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite Indian restaurant in the town. Our latest visit to the buffet I noticed that their sanitation rating was a 90.5, plus Tara portable heaters all over the place, and the floors were filthy. The selection in the buffet seems to be much less than I remember and it's not replenished very quickly. Possibly because we were towards the end of the buffet., but something to watch out for. The wait staff is very courteous, and the food is good, but I can't help but Wonder if the quality is headed downhill."}
{"text":"The smell of this place was a striking mixture of chai masala tea, cardamom and curry spices. The wait staff sat our group of four in a small middle table. This was a bit uncomfortable and we had requested a booth, but hey, they were busy.

We started off with two appetizers along with two bottles of La Crema, a delicious white that quenched the flame of the hot vindaloo dishes. My favorite appetizer was their sweet peshwari naan with cherries and coconut. This stuff tastes like pie filling!  Add to that the freshly baked puti (puffed bread) and we were on our way to fantastic meal.

Bombay Cuisine shines when it comes to curries, offering seemingly endless variations. Plus, you can choose the level of spiciness to suit your own tastes.  We ordered a five, not American five, but Indian five. The extra chilies cleared my sinuses and made my temperature rise.

As a vegetarians I found nirvana in the muthia (Indian dumplings) in a  vegetable cream sauce. We ordered three different curries and the carnos ordered tandoori chicken. The curries were served with basmati rice.

Overall the best dish was the peshwari naan. Never had I experienced a bread product that thrilled my taste buds in such a way. If you go try this naan and surely you will walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything. Good was awesome, service was cool, and prompt. Overall I would surely come back, thanks to living social. They had an awesome deal. $18 for $30 of God and drinks. This place is also an awesome place to eat vegetarian food"}
{"text":"When my stomach says \"Indian\" food for a meal, this is probably one of the first places that pops into my head.  I live in Matthews, but I still make 
the trip to Pineville for this food.

The dining area is a bit dark for me, but gives the place a unique atmosphere for a dining experience.  The servers are in all black and are very quick and attentive to re-fills (especially critical when eating spicy food since you may need some emergency cooling chugs).  The servers do a good job of telling you what dish is what as well.  Hopefully one day I can be pretty good at ordering and being familiar with certain dishes.

There are a ton of vegetarian options on the menu.  I tend to lean toward the carnivore side of the menu, but I tried the Palak Paneer and it was excellent (if you enjoy spinach and cottage cheese).

I'm hoping as Charlotte grows to be more diverse, more places like this show up on the map."}
{"text":"I love the food here!

I have tried many dishes here and everything has been solid.  My favorites being the vindaloo, korma, and palak paneer.  The rice is perfectly seasoned and everything tastes fresh.

I usually get the food to go.  It takes a while but I prefer that everything is made fresh, so I don't mind.  They always give you plenty of rice and will not hold back on heat so be careful what you ask for.

This is my Indian spot!  I drive 25 minutes for take out and do not seek closer Indian restaurants because I doubt I will find one I like as much as Bombay."}
{"text":"I love this place. By far the best Indian food in Charlotte. It's always fresh and delicious. They have a great vegetarian selection. Service is always quick and very friendly and helpful. They also do great take out. Which is so hot and fresh it stays hot enough to eat after my 20 min drive home. The food is spicy which is great for me but if you usually get a 4 and don't love spicy then get a 3 here."}
