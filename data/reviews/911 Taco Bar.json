{"text":"Excellent experience. Great food, fair price & wonderful to deal with. Used them for a large party & the attention to detail & customer service was second to none. Its a mom & pop local own business, that makes legit \" Mexican\" food from scratch. Would strongly encourage anyone thinking about Tacos for there next special event to hire them!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great food and great service, you can't go wrong with 911 Taco Bar! From birthday parties, to work lunches, to Christmas parties, I've always been full and satisfied.   And don't let the taco name fool you, they have a wide selection of food besides tacos, including tamales, enchiladas, quesadillas, rice and beans, chips, and the crema and multiple salsas are delicious.     But seriously the tacos are amazing! Six is my max so far...chicken, pork, beef, and at least one other I can't remember...birria, I think... always multiples of each  :-)   And besides being a great cook,  Antonio is super accommodating and really helps to make a great party.     I've  made myself hungry writing this and am already looking forward to my next meal with them!"}
{"text":"Loved every bite ! Not only are they prompt, professional, personable but they set up and in quick manner had all the fixings to go with the tacos and quesadilla you got to choose from pork,beef or chicken. And if there are leftovers you can keep them, but we ate everything! Will be using them again for our next family get together as it takes all the work away from us and we could spend more time with family and friends."}
{"text":"These lovely folks were at at Project Taco Festival at Craig Ranch Park this year and I am amazed. From the tortillas to the meat! It was absolutely amazing.

{"text":"I've hired 911 Taco Bar for 3 Family events and by so far the best tacos I've have had. Great flavor and the best Steak quesadillas. 911 Taco Bar not only has tacos but they have a variety of items on their menu. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"This was a huge hit!! They did an amazing and awesome job for my granddaughter's 1st birthday party! They arrived early and had everything set up even before the party got started. The tacos were so yummy and I received many compliments from the guests (and those who thought this was a great idea and not having to cook for once!)... I would definitely recommend 911 Taco Bar if you are looking for great tasting food and  they bring all the fixings!   Don't forget your containers! Anything left over... you take home with you! That was such an added bonus because I didn't have to cook that evening either and it was a win-win!   I will most definitely use them again for future events! :)"}
