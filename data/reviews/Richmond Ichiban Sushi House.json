{"text":"Sanitary issues. The sushi chef coughed on his hands and continued to make my sushi ..never washed his hands. Baaaaad"}
{"text":"I've had much better and fresher sushi at a food court!!  Fish smelled and the rolls had an awful, metallic taste to it. Even their fried rice was not edible...how does anyone screw up fried rice?!  Doesn't even deserve a one star rating but can't leave the stars blank."}
{"text":"I went for lunch twice at Ichiban. Both times I totally enjoyed the food (lunch special  Bul-go-gi) and service; salad is fresh, sliced beef stirfry in house source is very delicious and I love the miso soup and deep fried veggie and shrimp that comes as side. I would definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"Worst ayce sushi, I have ever been to. The ayce is very limited. Only saw the waiter twice. Once to get our order and the other time to drop of food. We actually asked the guy for the check and 10 mins later as no check came went up to the front and just paid. If they were busy I would understand. But we were the only one during lunch time"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow and food is not good.  One waitress was seating people, cleaning tables, taking orders and even washing glasses! We asked for forks for our 5year old and it never came. We also asked for 4 glasses of water 3 times and finally we got one glass for the table. We asked for 3 more, she answered \"I'll get the rest if i get a chance\". I finally had to go to her and wait for the glasses to be filled and bring them myself to the table.   Sushi had barely any fish on it and did not appear fresh. Won't return again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I have been here a few times already.. Very consistent. I really liked the atmosphere.  The sushi portions are a great value compared to price.   I specially loved a Dragon roll,spider roll and a seafood udon!"}
{"text":"Went there cause i was really hungry, came out hungry too, food is not fresh, you can use shrimp tempura as a weapon, only good thing was Sake"}
{"text":"I usually can tolerate all kinds of craptastic sushi, but this was next level. We ordered and the waitress didn't bring us our cokes until we requested them for a second time, which was fine, but the sushi was  a) not fresh (my tuna was turning brown) b) not wrapped well -- (picking it up meant it fell apart)  I've never left sushi on my plate before, and we paid so we wouldn't have to force it all down our throats.   Ichiban, never again"}
{"text":"Seems like an ala carte restaurant that was forced to offer an AYCE option. Interior and service make it appear that way. Has a decent number of options but not as big a menu as other Japanese buffets.  Cons: 1 can of pop only limit 1 scoop of ice cream only limit Food comes pretty slow. As previously stated it seems like they're not used to non-stop orders of food.  Pros: This is a huge pro which makes up for any con, since they do seem to work like a typical restaurant. I believe that more care and detail is put into any order ergo a tad higher quality. Just a tad.  The crowd seemed 50/50 on ala carte/buffet which is also a plus. 14.99 for weekend lunch."}
{"text":"Been to a ichiban sushi restaurants...this was definitely below par.  The service was very slow.  They messed up our order.  Not sure I would go back to this particular location.  The ala carte is very over priced.  The wasabi has no taste.  We has a spicy dragon roll that has no flavour.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with the seafood bento. Great food and excellent service. Recommended"}
{"text":"A Richmond Hill staple, been coming here for about 14 years. The food was amazing this evening. Everything was top notch and had loads of flavour. I also learned that Ichiban means number one. I order from the 'All You Can Eat' menu often and no complaints so far other than from time to time they won't offer something from the menu, today it was the ginger ice cream. Service is fast and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Underwhelming to say the least. Seems that they're still doing all you can eat sushi as if it's 2003."}
{"text":"sushi was fishy. food was generally awful. complained to server who did nothing about it. just said the chef was looking into the problem. we were the only customers in the place and the service was still terrible! he was watching a movie on his laptop when we went up to pad. worst sushi ever. will never go back."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant in an old strip plaza.  It's been here many years and is an AYCE place but this time when I went in they gave only the a la carte menu until I asked for the AYCE menu.   Service continues to be genuine and comes to check on your meal through the stay.  Food is good, service is good.  I would come back once in a while.    As I write this though, I am waiting for my tea cup to be refilled and the server walks right by after filling the tables beside me :-)"}
