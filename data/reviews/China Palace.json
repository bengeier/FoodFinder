{"text":"I love this place. The Pineapple shrimp is unlike anything I've ever tasted. The staff is great and the place is very clean"}
{"text":"I used to get delivery from here all the time when I lived in the dorm rooms at UNCC without a car. It was basically my only Chinese option since not a lot of places in that area have delivery. The rice here is REALLY dry and always tastes more than a day old. Besides the rice, the food is alright. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's average. The chicken wings are prob the best thing I've had from this place. Or any place actually. Sesame tofu and sesame chicken is ok but the sesame tofu tastes better. The lo mein is extra greasy but very tasty. 

If you call to order your food, the lady might sound rude and have a hard time understanding you. But after meeting her in person, she's really sweet and understands me very well. She's just not a phone person so don't be put off when you first talk to her on the phone."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place. If you're looking for a place with the perfect atmosphere and take out prices, this is it. Super clean, fast and friendly service! I took my kids and they were so sweet to them, even gave them some of the appetizers to take home along with to go sweet tea. Just the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in the university area.  Get the chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"China Palace may be the best Chinese food I've had--EVER.  I've heard from friends who had bad experiences here several years ago, but the restaurant is under new management and it's FANTASTIC.  The Kung Pao chicken is to die for (order it Chinese Style, and hot--if you dare!).  The best meal I had at the China Palace, though, was when I asked the waiter (\"Michael,\" who by the way plays classical guitar some nights) what was good.  He selected a menu for me and my friends that was absolutely delicious, and very reasonable.  Be sure to go with friends who are willing to pass the dishes (not the \"I'm just going to get this\" type).  It's an adventure, and I go every chance I get!"}
{"text":"We normally enjoy the food at the Cottrelle location but this location just opened so we thought we'd try this one as it was closer to us. We placed an order for pick up. We ordered the pakoras, veg chow mein and veg lo mein (they gave us non veg lo mein instead), chilli chicken, kung pao chicken, garlic paneer, deep fried tofu and veg fried rice. If you like your food bland then this is definitely the place for you. We have had Hakka food many times and enjoy flavourful and spicy dishes and none of these dishes delivered. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Yinz don't know what the hell you're talking about, or order the wrong dish. 

Do yourself a favor order the Lemon Chicken with seshwan* sauce instead of lemon sauce.....Thank my later"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you want to stretch your dollar without sacrificing quality. Its pretty cheap, food quality and taste are 100, and they deliver if you order $18 worth of food. There's also been consistency ever since i started eating here last year. The food portions are giant and last for about a week to be honest."}
{"text":"Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal."}
{"text":"We walked in a bit before opening time on Sunday, and they seated us and gave us eater, which was nice. Unfortunately, they didn't have any tea ready, but we couldn't really expect that. And it's been so long since I've been served fried noodles and duck sauce as a complimentary snack! Yum. The service was friendly enough.

The portions here are pretty substantial, so one may luck out with a second meal as leftovers. I ordered the Buddah's delight, a bit more expensive, but includes 3 separate dishes - tofu with a red/brown sauce, veggies with white sauce, and string beans. Overall, pretty decent. I was told, if the tofu was steamed, it wouldn't have taste so I went with fried. (Some places do well with steamed...) One picky eater really liked his General Two's chicken. The pineapple curry dish we ordered was decent.

I'd consider going again, if in the area!"}
{"text":"The 'very spicy' Kung Pau chicken was bland, watery, no chili peppers, and had more peanuts than vegetables."}
{"text":"I saw mixed reviews, so I was a little nervous about placing an order. I have to say I'm so glad I did! My husband and I got the General Tso, Chicken with Cashew nuts, and chicken wings. 
The Tso wasn't too spicy, but not bland either. It was not syrupy sweet like it can be at other places and was not fried too hard. I just loved it!
The Chicken with Cashew nuts was delicious too  (husband let me try a bite, and he liked mine a lot,) and there were lots of cashews on top. He especially liked that there were water chestnuts in it as well. 
The chicken wings were to die for! So crispy and juicy, with a moderate batter on them, and perfectly spiced. 
We will definitely be ordering from here again. The woman who took my order was so nice, and the inside was so pretty, with plenty of room to sit and eat if you prefer to dine in."}
{"text":"Delicious ndian style chinese food..I find their Manchurian and Garlic chicken yummy...Only Downer is lack of LLBO..."}
{"text":"We had ordered off the vegetarian menu for the first time as a friend of mine who accompanied us was on a vegetarian diet. So we went ahead and ordered cottage cheese pakodas, veg hot n sour soup, honey garlic vegetables and chow mein...never been a fan of vegetarian food so next time I'm going to ordered what I love that is some chicken I guess"}
{"text":"Oh boy I'm gonna try and write this before I lapse into a food coma. The lunch portions here are for freaking dinasours. I had KungPo Chicken and it was spiced perfectly ( may be too much for some milk drinkers but they'll adjust the level of spice on request ) . The celery,water chestnuts and green peppers in the dish were crunchy and not too oily. The fried rice was average but egg roll batter was flaky like a pastry. Some other pros were our food arrived in about a nanosecond and every server was super friendly. And if you need them ... the bathrooms are squeaky clean !"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 spring rolls & 2 soup, shrimp wonton and Thai chicken and shrimp. Both were horrible. The waitress did not know the menu and had to ask the kitchen to answer our simple questions. The wontons noodles were bland and overcooked, almost slimy. Not appetizing at all. I ordered the Thai soup MILD, it was served to me way too spicy. In the soup had lots of tofu and canned mushrooms, not mentioned on the menu. Not an appetizing soup at all. We were never asked if our meal was ok. Also, there was very little chicken (small bits) in the soup. The veggie spring rolls weren't fresh and the veggies inside were old and mushy (browning old sprouts).  I was very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5
Not too oily and food is flavorful 

Service - 4/5
Service is excellent. Quick and efficient. You should ask for Jason. He'll definitely make the effort to ensure you are taken care of.

Price - 4/5
Very reasonable

We (a party of 20) ordered dry chili chicken, sweet corn soup, hot and sour soup, chicken n shrimp rice noodle, chili fish, chicken pakora (with secret dipping sauce), veggie pakora, stir fried mixed vegetables, Hakka red noodles, Hakka noodles, etc.

All guests were happy with the food and service. 

Will definitely return. 

P.s. Maybe the previous reviewers had not so positive experience: but I can tell you that I had a completely different experience altogether."}
{"text":"good food - large quantities

if you like spicy food ask for the cs16 (very spicy sichuan dish) will make the same dish with shrimp for an extra charge

friendly service for a chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Good chinese food, i like the chongqing spicy chicken, but the beef and fish is too sweet, they are not so authentic as chongqing spicy chicken."}
{"text":"From entry to exist this was a poor culinary experience.  No one to greet and seat you even though servers/waiters were available.  Menus were brought to the table and left for the patrons to distribute to each other.  A jug of lukewarm water was left on the table for us to pour for ourselves and no other beverages were offered.  The food was ok (for what was avaialble) nothing special when compared to any other Chinese restaurant in the GTA.  The icing on the cake was the delivery of the bill. When we had asked for change it appears the server decided to take his own tip (more than 30% of the bill). When he was asked for the remainder of the change he claimed that he thought we gave him $40 when it was clear that he was handed a single fifty dollar bill.  Needless to say we definitely won't be returning.  You would expect to have a better experience when enter an establishment with the word Palace in their name!"}
{"text":"This is strictly a review of the food. The service was good but the food could have been much better. I won't compare it or say I should have gone to XYZ, but its nothing to write home about in my opinion. Better options out there."}
{"text":"Had a really horrible experience with this place.  Placed an order for delivery and the order was wrong and a person didn't get their meal.  Called back and they delivered the food but forgot another part of the order.  Called back a 2nd time and they gave me man answering the phone argued with me and made me pay again for the food they forgot.  This is very unprofessional and not a good way to treat customers.  I will never be ordering from them again.  BAD BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here once. I shouldn't say I ate it though. It was awful. Maybe I went on a bad day.Yes, it's nice inside (especially for a Chinese restaurant), but I'd rather eat at a hole in the wall that has good food."}
{"text":"My god this is definitely the best affordable Chinese delivery place in the university area. My boyfriend and I ordered Sesame chicken, Hunan beef, and fried dumplings. Everything was delicious! The $3.00 delivery fee was so worth it. The portion size is easily enough to last 2-3 meals."}
{"text":"Over the years I keep giving China Palace chances to impress me a little bit.

They never do.

The food is consistently bland and overpriced.  You'd think that Sewickley restaurants would be among  the best in the area, but NO.  I ordered a chicken curry dish.  Not a hint of curry.  At all.  When I called to explain my criticism they said basically, \"That's the way we make it\".  So they replaced it with General Tso's.  I wasn't expecting much, and I was not disappointed.  Meh.

I think they are afraid to make any real Chinese food for fear that people won't eat it, so they homogenize the taste for the least common denominator.

Will someone PLEASE bring some real Asian food to Sewickley?"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!  First of all it took us 15 minutes just to get a waiter and when he finally did come over he said - well I guess I'll take your order.  Then he brought our appetizers and said - oh I forgot your drinks.....then he brought the wrong food and didn't ask if we wanted our actual order - we had to tell him to switch it up.....rice was cold - food not so great......plus we were celebrating a birthday and had a coupon and he almost didn't want to honor the coupon cause it wasn't the actual birthday - and then to top it all off - NO FORTUNE COOKIES......do not go there - go to Asian Star instead!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here for 10 years and lately it has not been good.  Today the Lo Mein was dry and tasted like dish detergent.  Sushi grilled tuna tasted rubbery and the every other piece of the General tso chicken was tough.  There isn't much to choose from in Sewickley but time to try some alternatives."}
{"text":"I have been going here with coworkers for a while now. Fast service, reasonable prices, good selection. However, on my last visit there was a dead wasp in my beef and brocolli. Yes, you read that right. A dead wasp inside the meal that was brought to my table. I brought it to the servers attention and she asked if she could remake it for me. I declined but got the whole tables meals for free. Still won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat, ever. Extremely nice staff, great service, perfect food! Definitely start with an egg roll and an order of the crispy noodles. After those appetizers, you can't go wrong with any of their entrees! The Chicken with Chinese Vegetables is standard and delicious, their vegetable lo mien is fantastic as well. I've probably had over half the menu as I've been going there for at least a decade, I have never been disappointed. They deliver too. A little expensive but other than, perfect. The reason it is more than standard Chinese food is that you are paying for quality food."}
{"text":"The General Tsos is flavorful and peppery perfection.  The egg roll was fantastic and the rice is amazing. I would say top 2 or 3 place in all of Pittsburgh.  Make sure to stop in when you're in Shadyside for their lunch special 11am to 3pm Monday thru Saturday."}
{"text":"One night I was starving and craving Chinese. I called and asked what time they closed and they said 10. I placed my order and got in my car hoping to make it on time. Then I realized I forgot my debit card at home. I had to return home to get my debit card, which in turn made me late. I got to the restaurant at about 10:05 just as they were locking the doors to leave. I got out of my car and apologized for being late and they happily went back inside and retrieved my order and I was on my way. Very nice of them to do that as they had already shut everything down. Not to mention, the food is delish!!!"}
{"text":"Say a solid 3. Food is decent- nothing special or unique. Sushi is good. Service is consistently good and friendly. 
Be prepared to hear the worst music-some torturous examples like \"All By My Self by Patty Labeal\" and \"Richard Marx Greatest Hits\" in chimes. Yes..no words, no drums, just chimes. My ears are still bleeding."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and brown sauce as well as the soup and egg roll!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken in all of Charlotte! Really nice staff and very accommodating. I stop here after every concert I go to at PNC."}
{"text":"This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy, not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"In sum, we ordered take out here a few days ago. There were bugs in my egg drop soup. Nuff said.


Usually, I write these long reviews. Not today. I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop. I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out. I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday. Fortunately for me- I noticed the bugs prior to eating. Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup. Disgusting."}
{"text":"My visit was so bad that we didn't even eat our food and went for wings....

The service was horrible. I never thought it possible to mess up General Tso Chicken but it was inedible. The place smelled household cleaner and was empty. 

I was terribly disappointed. I went there many times in the past but it has been quite some time. Not sure if there is new ownership but whatever the change it is very bad."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better Chinese food restaurant in Pittsburgh.

It's a great place to come for a low-key and relaxing dinner. The food is averaged-priced for a Chinese restaurant which is a nice touch, being that it is located in Shadyside. I always have leftovers too-their proportions are huge!

The beef with scallions is delicious and so is the cheese wontons. The chicken lettuce wraps are pretty good too. The sweet and sour chicken was okay...the chicken was great but I found the sauce to be a little stickier than I prefer (maybe it's just me though).I do wish they would have crab rangoons though.

Great little Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Guess not my day . Chilli chicken on fried rice was my order 
Soup was watery
Chilli Chicken was bland
Friend rice was dry 
Spring roll has been re fried 
Used to be so good !!!!! Don't know what happened here . 
Asked for the bill and he said come to the counter to pay"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food with large portion size.  Plain but tidy dining room made up of dark red vinyl upholstered wooden booths (plain, not cushy) and apricot-painted walls with Christmas lights hanging around the front.  Everything looked clean.  The sanitation score was 94.0 when I visited.  

The \"fried rice\" that comes with the meal is just soy sauce stirred into rice -- no bits of veggie, let alone meat.  You can presumably get the real thing by ordering fried rice as a separate entree.  Luncheon specials from 11-4 priced at $5.95 including the entree, rice, and egg roll are very reasonable, though I have not ordered them.  The main menu runs from $8.95 to $15.95 for most entrees.  My Hunan Shrimp was $9.95 and included only the entree and rice.    

I visited there on a Sunday at dusk.  The place was deserted.  The counter staff (owner?) was reasonably pleasant and efficient, but the words warm or friendly just do not apply.  I was charged fairly and the carry-out food was freshly prepared, hot, nicely packaged, and in my hands in no time.

Once I got home, I found I had a large, very fresh order of Hunan Shrimp, which contained really large shrimp and lots of good-looking veggies cut into pretty large pieces.  The portion size was large and fed three hungry people from a single order. This was tasty and superior to what I usually get, so I recommend it.  The hot and sour soup was just okay; I have had better.  The spring roll was small and greasy; not recommended.

Their carryout menu states in large letters that they deliver for orders with a $15 minimum, but when I tried ordering delivery the following Tuesday, I was told that service was available only from 5-9 p.m. on weekends.   The carry-out menu only says they deliver within 5 miles but does not mention the limited availability of this service.  She said their weekday driver had returned to China; apparently, they have no plans to replace the driver

The food was fresh, tastier than many Chinese places, generously portioned, and reasonably priced for what you get, so I will be back."}
{"text":"It's not the worst, but not the best. It's a little overpriced for the quality of the food. I don't recommend getting the fried rice. It's not good at all here. I had the sesame chicken the first time I came here. I gave it a second chance and had the general tso's. Sesame chicken is definitely better than the latter. Don't go with high expectations"}
{"text":"I am a fan of China Palace, they deliver FAST and FREE... I often dont feel well enough to cook diner and i get into the 'mood' for soup and fried rice. Something about that combination for me is soothing. I do wish that they would offer a green bean with brown sause dish but everytime i ask- they dont have green beans, only snowpeas. :::(((
The prices are very reasonable and they are very fast at delivering your order. 

some dishes are better than others- you have to try different things. The orange chicken is a bust here ::((

Hot and sour soup is very good but i prefer a lot of tofu in my soup.

Over all its a good value."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh it's hard to find a Chinese restaurant with delicious traditional dishes! From the mapo tofu to squid, the extensive menu has something for everyone. Every time I'll back in Pittsburgh, we always swing by for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes, but the food did not arrive until after 7:00.  I had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot.  The duck itself was not that great; the skin (usually the best part of the duck) was soggy instead of crispy and the meat lacked flavor.  If anyone knows a place in Pittsburgh that serves good Peking duck, please message me."}
{"text":"Discovered the restaurant by accident a few years ago and have been going since. The food has more flavor than most of the Chinese dine-in restaurants around the 20 miles radius. The employees are always smiling and cheerful. The food is always good but I did notice their 8 piece chicken wings flavor have changed. It's a different batter, not the original but still decent. However, great place to dine in or take out."}
{"text":"We have been customers of China Palace since moving here 14 years ago.  We initially tried it just because they delivered (which we found awesome since only food delivery you can get in Albuquerque is pizza) and Chinese food sounded good.  It was so worth the wait. (They say 45 minutes but always deliver sooner since we live 4 blocks away).  Now we order 2-3 times a month.  And always when we have out of town guests.  

Great food - good, fast delivery at a fair price and they give you a generous amount of food for your money.
Never in 14 years have we had a complaint.  

Waiting for an order as I write this........I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there."}
{"text":"Very nice and pleasant. We ordered delivery and it came fast, hot and delicious. I mean wow I was shocked it's been such a long time since I found a good Chinese restaurant. The food had no msg in it. I could eat and not feel heavy or sick like most places I ordered from. It was just so delicious!! The food portions were huge! I mean all around awesome. Everything seemed fresh too!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant before Chuan Ba Wang on forbes ave. was open. I don't know why American people like to eat American Chinese food. If u like Chinese food, u should go to the restaurant which provide real food not just cheese or something. U will never find cheese in the real Chinese food. So if u like cheese please go to wendy's to order a burger."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and it was really good... General Tso's Chicken and they offer all white meat which is awesome!!! Also ordered beef fried rice and cheese wontons. Everything was hot and fresh. There were even fried noodles!  We enjoyed it...the restaurant itself wasn't busy for a Friday evening...but it was spotless and nicely decorated. Full bar available. ..we will be back!"}
{"text":"great food!!!
my husband and i are visiting from south carolina for a couple of days. 
didn't know the area too well, so i google chinese restaurants. 
\"china palace\"  had  41/2  stars and the other chinese restaurants had 4 and below stars.
my husband had the  general  tos chicken, and i had, chicken  chow mein  both with fried rice. the hot spicy chicken was  great also. 
my husband said after eating his dinner he would never order \"general tos chicken\" again in our hometown,  that's how much he enjoyed this meal.
we  highly recommend this restaurant. oh the services and greeting was also great!!!!!."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I have ever had. I ordered chicken and garlic sauce and what I received was a plate that was nearly entirely onions drenched in some bland brown sauce. It was completely flavorless. The pieces of orange rubber that were cleverly disguised as chicken did not manage to fool me.  

Incredibly over priced. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Terrible taste of food and expensive for a bad experience, fish taste like being in the freezer over a year."}
{"text":"Even as a vegetarian, I felt REALLY silly ordering \"orange wheat gluten\" or \"sesame soy protein\". But their vegetarian menu is fantastic! I'm happy ordering veggies and tofu and Asian restaurants. But I really miss sesame chicken, and I can get it at China Palace! 

The food itself is every so slightly above par. It's a little sweet, but not too oily. I can't vouch for their meat dishes, as the person I went with is also veg. They really manage to create satisfying, typical Chinese dishes, with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eaters.

It's definately expensive, we paid $40 for three entrees and a salad. And there's other Chinese food that's just as good for less money. But for vegetarians who miss \"typical\" dishes, China Place is so the place to go!"}
{"text":"We were visiting UNC Charlotte and felt like Chinese Food and this place was nearby. Very surprised, We ordered 3 main courses and everything was fantastic and so, so reasonable. I had soup and the wife and kids had egg rolls and springs rolls and everyone agreed the food was great."}
{"text":"Tried this place out while waiting for a movie to start this past weekend, and I now have the stomach flu.

My friend and I ordered chicken wings and the mixed chow mein. Our noodles were very, very salty and when I had mentioned it to the waiter he said \"oh really\" and did nothing about it.

it was after i finished eating a chicken wing that i noticed the meat left on the bone was pink. My friend looked at her chicken wing and noticed the same thing. We then took a look at the rest of our wings and the meat were all pink. I told the waiter and he took the plate and said he was going to ask the back kitchen what that meant and he came back and said \"They are undercooked\". He asked if we wanted anything else, we said no because our meal was already so disappointing, and he never came back to us again. We got up to walk over to him to pay and he said he wouldn't charge us for the wings (as if we would pay for it!) But he charged us for the noodles.

We are never going back to that place again. Our first hint to leave was probably the fact that there was NO ONE ELSE in the restaurant! 

If you eat here, please double check anything you bite into!"}
{"text":"Love their sweet and sour chicken! However, staff treated me like crap and a not a good level or professionalism was noticeable. I love their food anyway!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Great location, great veggie options. Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty.  Only 2 things that bother me, the hot and sour soup is TOO hot. I can't eat it. And it's not easy to find a parking space. Lots of driving around to find a spot. 
But the restaurant is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is not just a Chinese restaurant! Its a great Hakka food (Indian style Chinese food) restaurant! They have the standard Chinese fare, but really is about the Hakka!

Its a rather cool/surreal experience when you go in and the staff is all Chinese, the menu looks pretty Chinese, they are playing Hindi music(Bollywood variety) and all of the people in the restaurant are Indian!! 

Try the veg and paneer pakoras - they are made differently and very tasty. Get the chili paneer (or for those non-veg eaters, the chili chicken) - that tastes great! I like the manchurian veg dish - its made with cabbage which is what I am familiar with. And of course the hakka chow mein!

Please note that Hakka food is meant to be spicy!! So for those that don' t like the spice, stick to the chinese standard fare and ask for it to be not spicy."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in 10 years, but the food still tastes the same. Very good. The War Won Ton Soup is fantastic,  lots of won tons, shrimp, chicken and veggies.   Wish they had a Chinese restaurant  in a Morenci like this.  I gave it 4 stars because the containers looked to be smaller that I remember.  Must be a business decision."}
{"text":"I had the Szechuan Beef at lunch - basically it was a bunch of julienned veggies and a mere whisper of beef.  Tasty enough but skimpy on the portions especially the meat.  The sushi looked decent enough but was still pretty pricey.  This place adds up in a hurry so if you are at all discerning about Asian food, move on."}
{"text":"Bad service and food to match! The place is over priced. Service was rude and slow. Their General Tso's should be called Private Tso's!  Absolutely the worst I ever had the displeasure of tasting. My companion ordered a beef dish which had only a few smidgens of beef and were chewy and fatty. My son described his food as yucky. It was Chicken and broccoli and had an odd smell.We asked to see a manager and was rudely told he wasn't available. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"We were there in June. The food was below average. The sushi we ordered was inedible but we said nothing just didn't eat it. The General Tso's chicken was burnt but again said nothing but I did mention to the waitress (who I'm pretty sure was the boss because the other workers deferred to her) that our chicken in our chicken and vegetables was pink ( I just wanted to know if that was ok), She scooped up the plate without saying a word and brought it back without the chicken. After that we were persona non grata. We had to go to the bar to ask for water and our check. I can't remember when I had worse service anywhere. I typically leave at least a 20% tip but I left 15% and was mad at myself because she didn't deserve that. I wrote that on the back of our check and hoped that the manager would contact me but as I stated I think she was the manager. With all the restaurants to choose from I would never choose that one again."}
{"text":"Very fast and tasty Chinese food. Both dinner and lunch portions are HUGE. However, if you choose \"spicy\" there is a tendency to over-do it to the point of inedibility."}
{"text":"So disappointed.   I haven't ordered from here in a few years.  Recieved my delivery after 90 minutes.  The Kung Poa Shrimp was so sweet I thought I was eating dessert.  The lettuce wraps were too scary looking to even eat.

If you want to dump  $20 in the trash order up.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Serves beer, friendly staff, great for groups and sitting outside. A nice mixture of Chinese food and sushi which makes it easy to please the non-sushi eating friends (who are missing out)."}
{"text":"Walked out tonight....entered restaurant...3 employees looked at us and didn't say anything...we stood there long enough to where I thought we might have to seat ourselves....finally a guy said I'll be right with you....ok, I'm fine at this time because they are busy...the problem is when two separate people who came in after us for their take out orders. The guy and another employee started helping them. He again tells us just one minute and will be with us. He then starts making a drink for one of the tables... Somebody else walks in and the staff starts helping him with his takeout. Probably stood there for ten minutes and a total of 3 people and one table who came in after us were helped first. This is why we left and went to another restaurant. That was my first and last time there and I just moved in down the road (4 blocks). First impressions are everything."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  I got the sweet and sour chicken.  They have a good sweet and sour sauce.  The fried rice is good as well!  Loved the spring rolls!  I always have a hard time finding a place with good spring rolls...delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I got take-out from here (Chicken Lettuce Wraps).  They were very good, nice mixture of vegetables and chicken.  It could have used more lettuce wraps, I had only got two, three would have been perfect.  I also had some General Tso's Chicken, compared to most General Tso's I have had, this one is up there."}
{"text":"This place has average American-style Chinese cuisine. I was banking on it being \"my\" Chinese place, ya know what I'm sayin'? Like that good, bad for you food place that one can always count on for yummy food. However, the quality of the food here is hit-or-miss at best. It's either just decent, or just plain bad. For example, I ordered lo mein noodles as a part of a to-go order, and the noodles were burned. I'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles. Anyway, for the prices I expect consistent food quality and flavor, but that just doesn't exist here. I'm throwing them a couple of star bones because their service has always been pretty good."}
{"text":"The General Tso's with all white meat chicken is amazing!  Large portions and good customer service."}
{"text":"Great staff, excellent food, little to no wait, great prices. What more could you ask for?  I love this place and eat here fairly often. Try the orange chicken. Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Went in for hakka flavor but wasn't anything like it's supposed to be. Ordered chili chicken and an hour later the gravy turned very watery with the oil just floating on top. Go to a proper hakka place you won't find any here."}
{"text":"I've eaten at China Palace eight to ten times in the couple of years it has been open.  What I've learned is that it can be great one time and lousy the next.  The kitchen is very uneven.  I generally like their Governor's Shrimp for example.  It generally has a spicy sweet sauce with a light breading on the shrimp.  The last time I went, this same dish was cloyingly sweet with some kind of fruity sauce and the breading was heavy, laden with grease.  I could repeat this same story for any number of dishes I've tried there.  Sometime lots of spice, sometimes little.  Sometimes lots of veggies in the dishes, sometimes just a few.  And so on.

They do have an interesting menu and my Chinese friends have enjoyed it.  It's the closest thing to an authentic style of Chinese cuisine we have in Madison but it's a long way from the best of its kind.

Another issue is that they haven't invested anything in the decor or ambience.  It's old school bad Chinese restaurant style and it looks really old and worn."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  I always get the general tso's chicken extra spicy.  I will sometimes get the chicken fried rice.  Both of which are great.  There is one server that I have seen and he is able to serve all the tables in a timely manner.  The food comes out fast and hot.  If you call to order when they say 10 minutes, they mean 10 minutes.  

Overall best chinese place I have found in the University area."}
{"text":"Going to give them a 4 even  though I seldom go there, because they do have really good dish! The reason that I don't go often is that they have pretty bad rice.

Service is pretty good here. And they give you enough food with reasonable price so, there is got not too much to complain about.

For Chinese, Pig hand is a good choice. For general, chicken and broccoli is great. 
The rice is a bit too hard in the restaurant but seems fine for take out."}
{"text":"We drive to Charlotte from Winston-Salem several times a year just to eat here (ok...so we go to Concord Mills and IKEA too, but we always eat at China Palace afterwards!).  The Chinese food in Winston-Salem flat out sucks.  We like China Palace because it's an actual sit-down restaurant, unlike the vast majority of Chinese restaurants around us.  We always get the sweet and sour chicken and the orange beef when we're there for dinner hours; hubby got the orange chicken for lunch one time and said it was just as good as the beef.  The portions are enormous and we always have some to put in the cooler with a bag of ice for the ride back to Winston.  The meat is VERY well trimmed - no fatty or grisly bits.  The flavor is good and the dishes come out SMOKING hot."}
{"text":"I love the food here. 
But they aren't that courteous sometimes. 
Other than that, I absolutely adore this place."}
{"text":"Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service"}
{"text":"So we heard great things about this restaurant but boy were we disappointed. It's Saturday night, they are understaffed (which is not our problem really) and we have to go to the take out line to grab the attention of a waiter to seat my hubby and I. After waiting 30 minutes someone comes to serve us and take an order. 1 hour later our food hasn't arrived. We ask the waiter why others who were seated after us are being served dishes before us. She replies I am sorry the kitchen is busy with other orders but I will go now to tell them to start making your food. Food was mediocre but based on service and wasting 2 hours of my life here I highly do not reccommend this place to anyone. Not t least till they learn table order priorities"}
{"text":"I was really really in the mood for Chinese food so I stopped in for some take out. 
 I got Mongolian Beef- and asked for them to add ginger because that's how I make it and I like it.  The portion was in the round container I associate with the lunch sizes in everywhere I've had Chinese food from Chicago to New Jersey to New York- 
 but not lunch prices. I wouldn't mind if it were good though.
  But it really, really wasn't. It was bland. Bland, flavorless, and tasteless.
 The sauce was like the Au Jus you get in little containers with beef sandwiches- 
 thin, watery, and....unappetizing. With not even a matchstick of ginger to be seen. 
 Blegh. SO dissatisfied was I- that the next day I stopped  where I was traveling in the South Side at Chan An- a fast food looking joint- the portion was twice as large, the price half as much- and it was delicious. Think I'll go write a review for them now."}
{"text":"Have not found better in the area so I am left with no choice but to still order.  Prices keep going up.  Quality/Taste down, customer service down, they forget to give you coupons all of the time.  A few times they have gotten our order wrong.  The wonton soup is nowhere as good as it used to be and the Crab Puffs have next to NO filling any more, you just pay for fried dough."}
{"text":"Ordered Cantonese fried noodles. And asked for sauce on the side so my noodles won't get soggy.  And look how much noodles you get for $11.75.  I can not believe it.....what a rip!!!

And another thing......slow slow slow service. :("}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I still decided to try out this place.  There are not that many Chinese restaurants in Monroeville, and I've been feeling like Chinese food all day.  I just wanted some food with good taste.
The restaurant was pretty good size.  It was clean and somewhat welcoming.  The staff members were kind and nice. Me and my husband wanted to take out couple of dishes, so we ordered combination pan fried noodles, young chow fried rice, and palace vegetable delight. It didn't take long to get our food, and everything smelled really good. It was hard not to take a peak while driving back. 
Pan fried noodles dish was packaged so nicely.  The noodle was kept separately so that it doesn't get soggy in the sauce.  The taste was pretty authentic and delicious. There was a lot of vegetable in it, but not so much seafood/meat although the price was for a seafood dish. Still, the flavor was good. 
Fried rice seemed a little too pale with no flavor. But when I tasted it, it was actually pretty tasty. Maybe I was expecting brown fried rice that we usually see at hibachi places.
The vegetable dish was probably the most bland dish out of what we got. It was just pan fried vegetable in clear sauce, and the sauce was really oily. The whole container and the brown bag was drenched in oil underneath. 
Overall, food from China Palace satisfied my craving, and I would go back for General Tso's chicken that everyone is talking about."}
{"text":"The egg rolls are delicious - the best I've ever had! They also have many authentic Chinese options, not just Americanized."}
{"text":"This place looks like where suits on a budget go for lunch. 
For $10 you get a soup  and an entrée with a spring roll.The food is brought to you fast . I had hot and Sour Soup  not that great more of a Canadian style it even had parsley  no tofu  then I had sweet and not sure chicken  it was sweet once again Canadian style this not authentic Chinese food at all. I personally prefer authentic Chinese food, but if you're a fan of the mall food court sort of Chinese food then Im sure you'll like it. Its not bad but I personally wouldn't recommend it unless people love fake Chinese food I myself do not so I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"This was the first and the last time I ordered food here. Ordered 3 times and I had to trash all of it, sleeping hungry. Excessive oil in food. Burnt out remains seen in food in oil. Meat piece seen in vegetarian soup despite of mentioning no egg, no meat. Taste of food was nowhere close of Chinese food. Surprisingly order arrived in 15-20 mins itself."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times with my girlfriend and we have always been satisfied with the quality of the food here.  We had some Lo Mein the last time we both went there and it was really yummy.  The service was a little slow the second time we went and it was really slow in the restaurant itself, so I did not understand what the issue was with that, but otherwise this is a pretty good Chinese joint which is reasonably priced compared to some other places close by.  Awesome spot for lunch, which is when I would recommend going the most."}
{"text":"Top 3 in my book .. best in shadyside amazing here often ! General tso awesome & Walnut chicken too shrimp fried rice is amazing ... 5 star all the way .."}
{"text":"It was our first time there tonight. It reminds me of my old Chinese spot back in Jersey. Smells good inside. Authentic and good food. That's gunna be out new Chinese spot. I recommended that place. Prices aren't bad either. A+++"}
{"text":"This place serves what some consider Hakka food in Toronto.  It's a mix of Indian and Chinese food and you should really do your homework before coming here as the usual fare that you get from your \"Chinese restaurant\" will never be as good because you're probably ordering Cantonese, Shanghai or Szechuan food and this restaurant doesn't specialize in that and keeps it on the menu for familiarity sake.

We came by here before a wedding ceremony (much later in the day) and ordered some snacks which consisted of shrimp pakora's, chicken pakora's and chili chicken.  

The chicken pakora's and chili chicken were ok but MY GOODNESS THE SHRIMP PAKORA'S!!!  Dip it in the sauce and you're in food bliss!!!  In the car I mentioned that I thought the shrimp pakora's was actually in the top 3 pakora's I've ever tried and all my Indian and Chinese friends that tried them that afternoon agreed that it was one of the best ones they've had.

I'd give the shrimp pakora's a 5 star rating on their own.  The rest of it was ok."}
{"text":"I've dined in and gotten take out. This portions are huge so it really feels like you're getting your money's worth. Every employee I've ever encountered has been very nice and the food tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"Tyipical \"Chinese restaurant\" menu and flavour. Environment and service is above average, making overall experience decent."}
{"text":"I love ordering food from here! They always deliver the food quickly and hot. I love the cream cheese puffs and their walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"BEST EGGROLL IN TOWN!!!! Consistently delicious! I highly recommend the sizzling rice soup!"}
{"text":"This is really a neat little find! the food is very Fresh and the Mongolian chicken RULES! Great prices, attentive staff, and just cooked for you meals :) We have been going there for years! Good place for no fuss, less grease than usual Chinese food- Friendly family run business."}
{"text":"I've had better Chinese food at the ballgame! Food was cheap and bland, boasts no msg- maybe they should put some in to give it some flavor! There was not enough soy sauce to choke it down. I had the Kung Pao chicken and there was no Kung or Pao in it at all. The fried rice was like pellets.....Chinese food in Phoenix is pretty much abysmal all over, so I gave up. Whenever I go to California I just overdose on Chinese there."}
{"text":"We were out this way, and decided to give a local place a try.  The food was decent, and the staff was super nice and friendly.  We tried the snow pea pork, mongolian beef, and the orange chicken.  For the most part, they were what I expected except for the orange chicken. It was nice that it was all white meat; however, it was more the style of what I would have expected in sweet/sour chicken - fried breaded chicken bites.  Hmmm.  Not horrible, but I'm not a fan of the breaded and deep fried.  The food was ready amazingly quick."}
{"text":"After searching around Pittsburgh for the kind of Chinese food that can fill the void for Golden Chopsticks in Wheeling, I finally had a stroke of luck and found this place based on another Yelper's review. 

As a vegetarian, having so many options in one restaurant can be quite novel. Their menu is extensive, for both meat and vegetarian dishes. Oh, and the soups! There's veggie wonton, egg drop, corn soup, and vegetarian hot and sour! JOY! The entrees list is far too long to get into, but I'll say that proteins include tofu and soy protein \"meat\". My personal favorite and go-to entree is kung pao soy (it is really good with extra spice if you like that sort of thing) and veggie wonton and egg drop soups are my favorite. A nice pot of tea accompanies your visit and the entree potions are large enough to share if you are in the sharing mood. They also have a large lunch menu that includes a big portion of the dish you order and a soup.

The atmosphere at China Palace is pretty relaxed and calming, with minty green walls and dark cherry-stained chairs. The dining room is spacious and can easily accommodate groups of 10-12. 

Vegetarians, if you are feeling unsure about what is in your dish, look for the manager (owner maybe?) who seems to be a constant fixture there and who has a complete knowledge of the menu items. He'll gladly quell your fears and help you out with trustworthy information."}
{"text":"I bought a veg fried rice, w tofu and eggs for take-out (med spicy)

The food was good, and good tasting, veggies were cooked well. The serving size was generous  I think this is good for take-out, not sure if I would \"enjoy\" eating there. The interior is clean but drab.

No fortune cookie... that was weird (or maybe they forgot)."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese food! I enjoyed my stay here every time. The owner is so nice! I love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch for the first time.  It was very good.  Egg Drop soup OK, Orange Chicken was very good, my husband had chicken curry that he loved.  Service was good, food good, will definitely go back and take friends."}
{"text":"I don't understand some of these reviews. This place does deliver, the staff is always professional and pleasant, and the food is good. It's just that simple. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! We ordered takeout - was quick and affordable way to free 5 people with lots of leftovers."}
{"text":"While shopping around for Chinese delivery in East Mesa, I found China Palace. Now I always cautious when trying chinese, but to my dismay their egg drop soup was delish and my favorite entree moo shu chicken was amazing. Now a few of the dishes my bf got were just ok with the exception of the Mongolian...little too much onion for my liking but still good. Also they deliver for free! Only one time did I wait what felt like an eternity for my food to be delivered but they gave me a $10 comp for next order. There good in my book, but I'll keep shopping..."}
{"text":"Absolutely closest NY style Chinese food I've found since moving to the beach with no ocean in 7/1999. Everything we have tried is delicious they deliver but we are a little too far. The prices are good but the food is great and there's always leftovers for the next day even though two men and myself share it. Definitely worth trying I can guarentee you'll love it too. If you enjoy good food for good prices"}
{"text":"If you like authentic Chinese food like me, you will love this place. 

I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here.
I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.

My favorite dishes are: 
Chinese style mapo tofu, 
Beijing duck (you need to order it ahead), 
fish with the spicy sauce (The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),  
and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, and it came a lot faster than expected. The food is your typical Chinese take-out food, and the portions are very big."}
{"text":"The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!  Generous portions.  We called for a delivery to a local hotel we are staying in.  Very easy process.  Easy to order and food arrived on time, about 40 minutes.  Driver was equally as professional.  I've book marked them for future delivery here in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I had takeout delivered from here: chicken lo mein and 2 bowls of wonton soup (one for now, one for later). I can't be the only one who has done that before. The lo mein was rather greasy but still flavorful and good. Now that I've had better wonton soup, I now realize that China Palace's wasn't the best but still pretty tasty. I like a good strong broth, and their's qualifies as such. This food is a little bit more pricey than your average chine food, however the portions are big."}
{"text":"Great Hakka food, I love the Chilli Chicken and Manchurian Chicken the most.  The lunch specials are very generous in size and come with a spring roll and soup or pop.  Fast service, the wait staff are a little \"quiet\" but I've never experienced rudness of any kind.  I recommend this place for anyone needing a \"Hakka Fix\"...."}
{"text":"The meal was very good.  Not greasy and very flavorful.  Egg rolls could be a bit bigger but they were really good."}
{"text":"Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor, with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour.  Not all her fault.  And, the food was ordinary.  Not bad, a little tasteless, but why bother?"}
{"text":"I live a couple minutes walk from this place so I find myself coming here for lunch or dinner often when I'm in the mood for Chinese food.  

The servers are nice and good service is always important to me.  

I haven't tried many of their dishes as I always tend to order the same dishes but its a good place for Chinese food in shadyside.  The lunch specials are a great deal and I do like the interior of the restaurant.  

It's pretty much straight forward American Chinese food, not amazingly authentic or true to actual Chinese cuisine, but good enough for our western taste buds."}
{"text":"This was the only place not packed on a Friday night around 7, so it's where I went. I got the egg drop soup and the shrimp lo mein. The food was a bit pricey, but I figured I'd get better quality. I was wrong. It's mid tier Chinese food. The soup was a bit too watery, but not to the point that I didn't want it. The lo mein was a bit greasy, but I've had much worse. The shrimp and vegetables in the lo mein were well prepared.

What saves this restaurant is the free tea, the water in wine glasses, the prompt if not brief service, and the free orange slices they give you with your bill and your fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Now granted...we ordered delivery on Valentine's Day and we knew this going in. After an hour of waiting, I called to check on our order. The girl on the phone couldn't find out order (but swore she remembered entering it into the computer) eventually she did find it and said it had been fulfilled. I asked if it was out for delivery and she couldn't tell me. She couldn't tell me how much longer we would wait. She provided no reassurance; she provided frustration. The delivery driver arrived about 30 minutes later. All of the food was cold; when I called back to share this information, I received a lackluster apology from the same girl and she hung up. It wasn't the deliver driver's fault - we understood that he had a lot of orders. But plan ahead - it's a holiday. Call in additional drivers. Have back up plans. Forewarn customers of wait times before they order.  It's changed our view of a restaurant we used to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and inedible. Over priced and awful. Stay away. Do not order sesame chicken or lemon chicken."}
{"text":"I guess this food would be good to you if you've never had exceptional Chinese (Americanized) food. I've tried their fried rice, lo mein noodles, pot stickers, steamed dumplings, egg rolls, egg drop soup, and hunan chicken in two separate visits (wanted to give them a second chance). 

The customer service is adequate. They're not blatantly rude, but they don't go out of their way to be helpful (this includes the delivery guy). 

The one star is literally for the chips that come with the egg drop soup. This review is not an exaggeration. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the sushi here. I thought, this far from the city there would be no way that the sushi would be good, or even edible. But, I went for it anyways and was rewarded for my adventure. Everything was fresh and tasty, although they didn't give us exactly what we ordered... Meh, it was good anyways."}
{"text":"Don't go here, they don't accommodate the customers. I place  an order to go over the phone, sesame  seed chicken, white steamed rice. picked up the order. After I arrived at home I realized my order was wrong. Instead of white rice my order had fried rice with eggs. I am allergic to eggs. I called the restaurant to inform them that my order was incorrect. Although they made me a new order, I had to return the messed up order. As if I were lying about the incorrect order. For my inconvenience, time, and my gas, I asked to be reimbursed. They gave me free cup of soda...really?"}
{"text":"The house fried rice is delicious! That's all I get...seriously LOL. The service can be better but don't expect too much from Chinese takeout spots. It is conveniently located in a shopping center with a lot of activity and parking so no issue there."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go here, hoping to fix my Chinese food craving, and was kinda disappointed. Looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed were the prices. Food options were pretty expensive for Chinese food and there was a lot to choose from but not any descriptions. I originally wanted General Tso Chicken, but it was placed under \"Chef Specialties\" and cost $15. So I settled for Kung Pow Chicken. My food order came out very quickly and I was on my way. The food itself wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. My meal was somewhat warm and I would have liked a little more flavor. Overall, I don't feel the food was worth the price."}
{"text":"Love the food here, way better than new china doen the street. My favorite is the Mongolian beef extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Chinese restaurant in Sewickley, PA. Friendly service and wide variety of menu offerings. The food is average, the prices are higher than other Chinese take out, but the portions are on the larger size. Would recommend other take out offerings in Sewickley."}
{"text":"I guess I must be missing something, because my review does not reflect those of others on here. I absolutely love China Palace. I think there General Tso's is one of the best in the city and I could snack on their \"chips\" and duck sauce all day (and I almost have). 

They have a bar inside as well, which is a less common, but welcomed addition to a chinese restaurant. My recommendation? General Tso's or Sesame Chicken every time."}
{"text":"Man this is my favorite chinese place in the queen city by far."}
{"text":"What a rip off.   Located close to the hospital I was in for surgery.   Spent $44 on 2 incredibly small entrees,  that also included an extra charge for fried rice.... And that was all it came with.   The guy I spoke with on the phone had an attitude problem when I ordered.   He acted like I was disturbing his mobile Twitter selfies or something.   And we weren't given any napkins or utensils when we picked it up.   Don't waste your time or money.   Plenty of other Chinese cuisine in the area.   Oh and lastly,  the food was subpar at best.   Everything had that \"freezer to microwave\" Flare to it.   Probably frozen panda Express from giant eagle."}
{"text":"When a restaurant says that they're open until 9pm and they refuse to take orders at 8:45, they aren't actually open until 9pm. Perhaps one should figure out how \"time\" works."}
{"text":"People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).

Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably \"not that bad\".

Here's what we ordered:
- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)
- Chicken Lo Mein
- Beef Lo Mein
- Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)

Let's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \"authentic\" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.

DO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time today. The food was good, better than expected. Good portion was in range with the price and the wait staff was friendly, but a little slow. I do believe this was due to the fact it was only one waiter there. Would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! 

Friendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"General Tso chicken lacks in chicken. It's fried dough, and dried and tough like it has been sitting out too long. Beef and broccoli is good though."}
{"text":"I felt that the food was sub par. I ordered boneless pork, and the meat looked old. It was dry, and the sauce they used wasn't good. The pork lo mien was a disappointment as well.  The white rice was also dry. The wonton soup had decent broth, but the wontons were way over cooked, and the filling was tasteless. Other people in my party had ordered food that I didn't try, like egg drop soup, and beef with broccoli. They said there food was ok, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"So nasty, I would rather go to panda, I have no idea why they left the bone in the teriyaki chicken plate but it was nasty and I would never recommend it to anyone. I felt like crap the next day too."}
{"text":"This place gets a bonus star for having a good egg roll. We ordered lunch for delivery, I had the pineapple chicken, it couldn't have tasted more bland, the chicken looked boiled and was rubbery, the sauce was as thin as broth and lacked any flavor. The portion size was much smaller than I have ever received from a lunch menu; I know a lunch portion is typically smaller and cheaper, but for $7.25, I expected more. I have always been able to have two meals even with a lunch portion, this was barely enough for one, which is good considering the flavor profile."}
{"text":"Good Chinese's food with a nice staff that answered a lot of my questions + everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The service is awesome and so is the food! Best crab Rangoon me and the bf have ever had. The man that waited on us was super sweet and attentive, even bringing us to go cups of sweet tea without us asking and put our food in our boxes for us."}
{"text":"This is review is simply based on a chilli chicken lunch special, and the stars are according to the value ($7.50 w/ pop). Certainly not the prettiest location and I didn't even see the interior since a friend picked up the takeout.
With all that said, it's a very enjoyable lunch for its price. I had the chilli chicken 'dry' (at my friend's recommendation) so there wasn't very much sauce in the fried rice. The chicken is tasty and a good amount of spice, and not too batter-ey. I really enjoyed the fried rice which had a bit of veggies, peppers, fried egg and of course seasoning. Spring roll was fairly typical and unspectacular. Oh, and they are very generous portions, since I got a pretty full and heavy styrofoam container (and not short on the chicken).
I may try a larger order or dine in sometime and update my review; but for now, a very solid, inexpensive takeout option when in the area."}
{"text":"Really great food! I highly recommend their specials. I got the tofu w/ vegetables special, which was not only tasty, but also the tofu had an amazing texture that I've never found in other restaurants. Unlike most restaurants that have unreasonably high minimum order values for delivery, China Palace has a more reasonable $12 minimum. I'd definitely order from them again on cold evenings."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD. I get orange chicken every visit and I can always count on it being really good each time. They give you so much food for such a reasonable price! I eat half and save the rest for the next day- 2 meals for the price of one! (great for college students). The same two girls are usually working the counter and they are always so nice when I go. Going to miss this place when I graduate!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I went here was because of a commercial... something about being rated the #1 Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Well, something along those lines. 

Inside, the restaurant was clean and well kept. I was greeted by the staff and my waiter was very prompt with menus, my drink order, and food.

The menu was filled with many great choices. I decided on the Chicken Pad Thai because most Chinese restaurants can pull it off. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but I was surprised at how good it tasted. I wasn't a fan of the price seeing as how I could get a bigger portion at another location.

Still, the food tasted good and the service was great."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Yelp for the first time. The food was alright and the delivery was a bit slow. I neither liked or disliked my experience."}
{"text":"I placed my order through eat 24 and i have to start my review off with the pros and cons of china palace but this is solely based upon my experience

Pros-
Fast delivery
Good Teriyaki chicken
Excellent spring rolls

Cons-
High prices ^$$$$
The wonton soup, very \"muddy\" so to speak (didnt bother to eat it and threw it out)
Fried rice isnt the best (so fed the rest to my dog)
Did not like the high price of over $3 just for lo mein noodles to compliment my teriyaki chicken so settled for fried rice as i said before not the best 
& one issue i did find with delivery is the fact the drivers carry little or no change, i had a tip ready for my driver along with a $20 bill and my total was almost $17 as i asked for change the driver seemed to feel as it was an inconvenience to give change and i felt as though he wanted a bigger tip or their employers do not stress the fact they need cash on hand incase of change.

Final conclusion-
Some food is good at this place such as the items i had written down but to be honest with my first experience in mind I wouldnt advise anyone to waste cash on an order that could lead to disappointment but as with any restaurant its hit or miss but pretty much a miss in my experience good luck to the next person that places an order, i hope your experience is better compared to mine

For what its worth

{"text":"My 1st time there and I was struck by the few number of other diners there. The food was good and I would enjoy going back to eat there again. However, I would rated higher stars except for the service. I had one server who was outstanding and another server who gave below par service and just did not have his head in the game."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: A clean modern atmosphere that doesn't look tacky and suits the restaurant well. 

Food: The food is quite good and easily the best Chinese restaurant in the area and dare say all of Charlotte in its price range. I usually get the Sesame Chicken or General Tso's chicken and both are always exceptional.

Service: Service is always prompt and the waiters are very attentive.

If you're in the University-Charlotte area give this place a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Get take out on a regular basis and it is always good.  Very good General Tso chicken."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time, so since I had business to take care of in Sewickley, I thought I would get some take-out.  Used to really like to the place, but was disappointed.  I ordered the tender blossoms stir fry.  It was supposed to be spicy (that is what the red hot pepper means next to the name right?), but there wasn't even an inkling of 'heat' or spice.  Also got one of the rolls (can't remember which one), but it was boring and lacked flavor too."}
{"text":"Didn't know you could mess up Chicken Lo Mein.

Delivery came somewhat cold, EXTREMELY bland. I didn't know lo mein could be so tasteless!

I'm actually putting salt on it right now to try and add some flavor to it. I'm adding sodium to lo mein. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is only limited to one item I've gotten from here, the orange chicken, which I was hoping would at least be as good as Panda Express. Nope, way way worse. First off, it was breaded like sweet and sour chicken usually is. Never seen that before and definitely not what I wanted. Otherwise the people seemed friendly and it was a decent price. But if they can't figure out something as simple as orange chicken why should I bother to try anything else?

I like New China down the street more."}
{"text":"Food is ok, kind of bland. Chicken was chewy and cold. Nothing special about service either."}
{"text":"A nice place.  In typical Sewickley style, it's a bit overpriced, but the food was tasty and the service was friendly.  The decor inside is modern and swanky.  My only other reservation about it is that there really wasn't much variation to my dinner.  It was a plate of chicken and veggies with rice.  There were no other elements.  I would have liked an egg roll or something - just something for a little variety.  It felt like a very big plate to plod through with nothing to break it up.  Thankfully, it was a very yummy plate so I soldiered through, and my tummy was happy.  

I would definitely like to return to try their mixed drinks - the menu was impressive and intriguing.

A word to the wise - be careful with leftovers.  My box leaked all over the place."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, and our other staple Chinese food place already closed, we skeptically tried China Palace. The reviews are so mixed on here that it's really hard to find any consistency. So I'll start off by saying to give this place a shot because reviews won't cut it.  You may have a bad experience, you may have a good one - it's really hard to gauge based on everything here; be adventurous and try it out and then write a review!

For our experience, we ordered steamed dumplings, sweet and sour pork, and chicken fried rice. We unfortunately got sweet and sour chicken instead but it was all still good quality food.  As a New Yorker, the environment felt incredibly similar and reminded me of Asian food \"back home.\"  For the price, I enjoyed the food and had plenty to take home.  For me, I couldn't beat the location to my house and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow. This food is simply amazing. Back in Seattle there's s vegan Chinese restaurant that is amazing and China Palace is neck and neck. I've only tried the Soy protein general Tsaos 'chicken' but I cannot wait to try more. Perfect flavor and large portions. It was just very expensive. $18 before tip for the dish with a side of brown rice. Yikes."}
{"text":"Really bad delivery service. Driver called me from parking lot and told me to come get my food...

The prices were very high. I paid $20 for general tso's, crab rangoons and a Pepsi. It was good but unfortunately not $20 good especially with the poor delivery service.

Sorry but I definitely won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Nice Chinese food in that area.. 

Nice restaurant too compared to other $ sign restaurants around!"}
{"text":"Tried it...didn't like it. For the price, the portions are small compared to other Hakka restaurant in the area. The food doesn't have that much of taste and chicken seemed uncooked because it was pink inside. Won't be going back again!"}
{"text":"This place isn't even worth the 1 star. This is BY far the WORST Chinese food I've ever had in my life. All I ordered was chicken fried rice, and chicken wings. First the rice, by looks, it looked OK. Then I tried a bite, and it tastes like seafood. The \"chicken\" was dark gray, and had a very odd texture and was like chewing on a piece of rubber. Second the wings. I think these wings were cooked last week. They were SO dried out, i could barely bite into them. TOTAL waste of $$. I will NEVER go back to this place, and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Gee I sure wish Sewickley would get a decently consistent and reliable Asian restaurant. Have been here more times than I can count over the years, and have never been thrilled, but it's the only game in town. Have narrowed the menu down to a few acceptable dishes.

Used to love their Palace Special Wonton soup until I was eating one time without looking and ingested a complete chicken vertebrae column. Enough of that! Chicken with Broccoli is sometimes decent, often not. Kung Pao Chicken (props for offering white meat only) is often good, but as with many of their dishes, they're not careful with ingredient trimming (e.g. garlic stems, chicken cartilage, bamboo shoot bark, bones, etc.). Young Chow Fried rice was great one time, have not had it that way again. Various lo miens are too often way greasy and have unchewable items. Pan fried wontons are a bit doughy but one of the better app options. Think they may have overextended themselves by offering newer Thai dishes - more miss than hit. Have tried all their \"Chef's Specialties\" at one time or another. Orange Chicken has a decent spicy-sweet sauce, but the batter is too thick and it definitely doesn't travel well (read: soggy). 

Noticed a sign on the door a few months ago heralding a new chef specializing in spicy recipes, which got me really excited. Have not noticed any changes in the menu or food makeup.

I will give them credit for a comfy atmosphere and excellent service. Just wish the food lived up to it. C'mon Palace, you may have a decent loyal customer base now, but just think of all the people you could gain that travel outside Sewickley for much better fare that used fresh, authentic ingredients with way more creativity and consistency! Since I'm a huge Asian food fan, I for one would become a frequent diner vs once a month!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting service! The food was horrible! So called Chinese food; the orange chicken tasted like nacho cheese sauce with chicken, and they refused to take it back! And we complained they swamped out one clementine and said it was an orange! ALL the food was disgusting! Later the people behind me had the same problem, so this isn't a bias opinion! please don't waste your money and come here!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Po Po platter, house fried rice, egg drop soup, doesn't get any better. great service.."}
{"text":"Disappointed with food! Beef and broccoli not appetising went in the trash, we ordered other dishes all unhappy with the food, fried rice not what you would expect at all. Very few people in the restaurant....what a bummer!"}
{"text":"This place was \"OK,\" but I probably wouldn't go back. Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine. Not really bad, just not good either."}
{"text":"Always consistent and better than the local competitors. Fast and friendly staff. Great food for the price!!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch delivery and I received it a lot quick than expect. The food was hot but the seasame chicken had a lot of pieces that were hard and over cooked and the teriyaki chicken had very little flavor. The kids enjoyed it, I just wasn't the biggest fan."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and it's a pretty good deal. About $7.50 for bowl of soup (hot and sour, egg drop, or wonton), rice (white, brown or fried) and a meat dish. I got to try the chicken and garlic and general tsao's. The chicken and garlic sauce was good, but I disliked the veggie that they cooked with. Not sure what it was, tasted almost like a bitter celery. I ate all the chicken out of it but left the veggie. It's kind of hard to know what you're going to get since the lunch menu has no description of the dish, just very generic names. The general tsaos sauce was good but the chicken was a little dry. I liked the soups although the hot and sour could have been both hotter and more sour.

It's certainly not the most amazing food, but for convenience and good service, I'll probably return for lunch."}
{"text":"Over priced for the quality of the food. Just ordered takeout and ordered mooshu shrimp which had a very light amount of shrimp in the portion. The dumplings were mostly just dough with sauce, little meat and for two people we managed to spend $35 somehow."}
{"text":"My family and I love this resturant. We have been going here for years and have never been disappointed. Food is always delicious and the service is good. We love the sweet & sour chicken and mongolian beef combo plates. If you want good food in a relaxed atmosphere this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews on here but we had a great experience! We had a big delivery order and I was impressed with how quickly our order arrived. I got the Hunan soy protein after seeing a picture of it on yelp. It tasted just as good as it looked. I enjoy the slight ginger taste it had. Everyone agreed it was the best dish we ordered. Even some of our friends who never tried tofu before. Also ordered hot and sour soup because I enjoy it. Theirs was delicious! Perfect amount of spiciness.We were all sharing our food and sampling each other's. The vegetable lo mein was lacking flavor but not bad. I'd say meh and wouldn't order that again. Egg rolls were crisp and delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food! I'd definitely go back just for the Hunan soy protein and hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"The reviews were all right!  We just ordered from China Palace and it was so delicious!  Our food was hot and it was all very tasty. The egg rolls were smaller that what I'm used to, but still good. I was so happy that they were even generous with the sauces they packed with our meals...lots of dick sauce and soy sauce, and we didn't even ask for it. It's like they read our minds!  Great food and they delivered which was also a plus!  We'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and at first glance the comfortable sofas, beautiful chandeliers and booths looked very promising. We waited less than five minutes to order and the food came out quickly. My friend ordered a Thai curry which smelled sort of funny so she had to change her order. The server was very accommodating and got another item for her. I ordered the vegetable manchurian. I am very particular about vegetable manchurian as this is the one item I always order at every hakka restaurant. Unfortunately my plate was bland and not as salty or spicy as I usually like it- even though the portion was very big for 10 dollars. I was not impressed with the taste although the customer service was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is my second time back. This place is so DELICIOUS! I recommend when you get a chance to try everything on the menu, that's what I'm gonna do every time I come back. This is my go to place when I'm craving Chinese in the University Area."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.

I wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged \"NO\"!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  

Anyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.  

Were they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out from this location quite a bit over the years, and dined in with big groups a few times. Food has always been on point for us. Some of my favorite hakka food in the GTA. I usually remind them to make my food brown people spicy. Servings are pretty generous and I do enjoy the family style dinning. I had a lunch special once, that was also pretty good with a great serving size.

The interior isn't anything exciting, but it is decent, well lit, clean, and comfortable."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews and I'm kind of surprised by the horrible ones. China palace is close to me and is a go to place for late takeout dinners for years. The food is decent with generous portions. I've never had horrible food but I usually order the fried rice, singapore rice noodles, sweet and sour fish and the dried chilli chicken. So far it's been okay. I rate it 3.5"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food at an affordable price. Their lunch special is among the best in terms of quality and price."}
{"text":"Had some business in another establishment at Jonnet Plaza and I was hungry.  It was either this place or El Campesino, and I wasn't eager for Mexican.

The restaurant is dark and plain, like many strip mall Chinese restaurants.  Typical assortment of Naugahyde vinyl booths and black metallic tables and chairs.  The staff was welcoming and friendly.  The menu was huge, though the lunch menu was limited to one page.  

$6.95 gets you an egg roll or soup and an entree with either steamed or fried rice.  I went for the beef/broccoli with fried rice.   Diet soda.

The egg roll was okay, but cold.  Granted, it was 2.00p or so, but couldn't it have been warm, at the very least?  

The entree was good.  The broccoli was fresh and still a bit crisp, not at all overdone.  The beef was tender.  The sauce was fine.  

The fried rice was nothing but rice with a couple of peas here and there.  

I ate.  I paid the bill.  I left.  Utilitarian but nothing special.  It wasn't bad but it certainly isn't a place I'd go out of my way to patronize.  

I did notice a lot of people -- local shop and business people from their attire -- coming out of the place when I first arrived at the plaza, so I assume it's a popular lunch spot for the folks in the surrounding stores.  

If you're stuck out near Miracle Mile and looking for some decent, run-of-the-mill Chinese food, this place will do."}
{"text":"Horrible. Do not go here. Crappy service and food. I ordered a beef stew, which tasted like rotten flesh. Could not eat it. My partner ordered a chicken dish - he asked the waiter beforehand if it was deep fried and the waiter said no - however, it came deep fried! Waiter clearly did not know what he was talking about. He was also very rushed - kept wanting to clear out plates and gave us the bill immediately after we are without checking if we were done! There are better Chinese places on Pittsburgh - this place should be shut down! There is nothing Chinese about the food!"}
{"text":"Called to place a take out order and was asked to please hold, 4 min later hung up tried to call back 3 times and got a busy signal, all three time. will not waist my time calling again , was told by friends they were good but I guess that will remain a secret"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, great Chinese food here!   My dad and I came here for dinner last night after finding out that Jimmy Tsangs had closed.  Rick had to teach a night class and Mom had a meeting to go to.  Besides, I hadn't been here since my last review.  Yeah, I know the chow here is Americanized Chinese food.  Who cares--it's great stuff!  

Now when eating Chinese, you should never begin by diving in to your main course right away.  First you've gotta have some soup and some egg rolls!  Dad and I both began with some r-e-a-l-l-y good hot-n-sour soup.  Man, that was good-n-bold.  Warmed my insides right away!  Now I know that vegetable spring rolls are supposedly better for you.  Yeah right--what's a great Chinese dinner without some good old fashioned egg rolls?  I like to put a spoonful each of sweet-n-sour sauce, duck sauce, and hot Chinese mustard on my plate, dipping my egg roll in a different one with each bite!  

I love the names of some of their specialties here, including the Triple Crown, Three Afire, Sizzling Trio, and the Royal Match.  Feeling a little adventurous--and why not:  the old man was paying--I went for the Jaded Affair.  Yum, scallops and shrimp marinated in white sauce.  Usually seafood isn't my first choice.  My dad went for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I've got to give him credit--how a guy his age can eat that and not reach for the Mylanta is beyond me!"}
{"text":"Just by chance!
I pulled into a shopping center to make a phone call and noticed the good looking Chinese Resturant.
What a treat.
I measure a Chinese Resturant  by how well they craft their hot n sour soap!  It was dark, full and a wonderful deep taste.  Worth a 5 star by itself!
I had luncheon General Tso's and it was very good.
The place was clean and the owner, Lee, was very nice and cared about his customers.
The place was very clean including the restrooms.  They were brightly lite.  I would have given a 5 but one of the bathroom booths had a door lock that you had to reach into the door to make it work!

Other than that EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"From the location listed I was looking for fine dining.  This restaurant was good enough but not my favorite.
The hot and sour had a strong onion taste that dissapated after a couple of spoons full. I guess it was not the taste I was expecting like the General Tsos was crispy like I like it, ......but it had a strange taste.  It certainly was edible, just different.
The \"fried rice\" was good and very tasty.
All in all a decent lunch but the smaller portions left no room for take home."}
{"text":"Its americanized, but pretty tasty! I love the fried rice and usually just get that. We were getting takeout once and waited at the bar, and the bartender gave us free tastes of the lychee cocktail while we waited! And that was tasty too!

Its also never crowded, its quiet and the service is consistently not bad. 

All that being said though, there isn't really anything special about this place. Its just kind of...eh... Best as take out."}
{"text":"Lunch out with family and initially we were heading to Pei Wei but saw China Palace was nearby and had good reviews. We were not disappointed! General Tso chicken was one of the best I've had and chicken lo mein was a favorite of my sister's. Large portions for lunchtime but so so yummy!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese in Monroeville. Clean resturant, consistent food, and an extremley friendly staff. If they could only get out of the ugly Jonnet Plaza."}
{"text":"I will say that you do get an enormous plate of food for $6 lunch special. I ordered the Sa-Cha chicken (spicy) and accepted the recommended fried rice & eggroll. Wait of less than 10 minutes after order to get food. Only 2 other tables seated at that time. 
Spicy was not very spicy. Fried rice seemed to have been reheated instead of fresh. Food was hot, and the plate was filled rim to rim. 
But just not that tasty. Lots of veggies, which I liked, but the whole thing was just blah. 
Egg roll was small and OK. 
Free crunchies with duck sauce to start. 
Waitress never checked back after food was delivered, so no beverage/water refill offered. 
Nothing bad, but nothing good either. 
Don't think I will make a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"I have never, ever thrown food away, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup. Holy moly was that a poor decision. The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy \"pork\". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened."}
{"text":"This place is an okay spot to grab lunch or dinner. All the other restaurants in Sewickley were closed since it was a Monday, so we settled for this. The food is very good, though the service is iffy and the items are slightly overpriced for Chinese food. It's definitely not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for mehh Chinese delivery food, which usually takes 30 minutes or so to arrive.

For those who want to dine on the premises, the restaurant itself is clean and nicely maintained. Ambiance is casual and low-key. The staff are very courteous and friendly. The place is usually not too busy and service is reasonably fast.

China Palace offers a huge variety of food. Most items are reasonably priced and there's almost nothing here that is lacking, in the Ameri-Chinese context. General Tso's, Kung Pao, Orange chicken, Seafood Delight, Chicken in Vegetables, Eggplant in Garlic Sauce - all served in good portions. Flavors are about what you'd expect for the standards. It's not a joint I would take out-of-towners or a date but it does well enough in a pinch."}
{"text":"I have no idea where all these positive reviews are coming from! All I can assume is that most of their reviews are from college kids (which we all know will typically eat anything). This is the absolute WORST Chinese food I have ever had. 
Where do I even begin?
We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Crab Rangoons, Hot and Sour soup, and Edamame. Not a single thing was satisfactory. The chicken in the Kung Pao chicken was tiny little pieces and breaded. You aren't supposed to bread the chicken in Kung Pao chicken. They probably did this to increase profits as breading it makes it look like there's more. Also, the vegetables in the Kung Pao chicken were merely celery and carrots, nothing more. The flavor was okay but the ingredients were just crap!
The crab Rangoons were soggy, not crispy. 
The absolute worst was the hot and sour soup. It had the consistency of saliva, not soup. And the flavor was atrocious. I wouldn't even feed this to a homeless man for fear of bad karma.
Finally, the edamame didn't have salt on it. There are two steps to cooking edamame, boiling it and salting it. They couldn't even get that right.
These people are obviously out of their minds.
I would only eat here again if it were my last option as a starving post-apocalyptic version of myself, even then I might reconsider."}
{"text":"In town for business and found this spot close to my hotel. One of the best cashew chicken dishes I have ever tasted. Made perfectly with great flavor to the sauce. The hot & sour soup was also terrific. Staff was beyond courteous and friendly. Wonderful meal. My compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"Be cautious!!!!! 

After much contemplation, I decided to l leave  this review here after all. I've been to this restaurant many times in the the past and usually enjoyed the food, but after my last visit, I doubt I'll ever go back again. I found a giant piece of metal in the rice that I had put into my plate, if I wasn't paying attention, I would have most likely either broken some teeth whole trying to chew on that or worse have torn my gums or esophagus  while accidentally trying to swallow it. My grandmother who is 84, would definitely have not seen this coming while eating. We did speak to the manager about it and she was just as shocked about it and didn't make us pay for the meals and offered us take out boxes but we were just too disgusted to take home any left overs. 

Now, I know this may have been a misnomer, one of those things that could have happened to anyone at any other place as well but it happened to us over here. I wasn't hair in  my meal, or an ingredient I was allergic to but at least a 2-3 inch long rusted and charred metal piece  instead. So, either they need to get health inspected again or need different kitchen staff that is more diligent than to let this happen again. Its absolutely horrifying."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible to make bad dumplings or won ton soup, but this place proved me wrong. You're better off buying frozen Chinese from the grocery store and making it yourself! I spent $10 and only ate the fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Worst chinese food ever. I was hungover and starving, could probably have eaten anything and i couldn't even stomach basic general tso's chicken. smdh."}
{"text":"We are eating our food just as I am writing these review. You can imagine, writing this review is more enjoyable than the food that has been served. I ordered green curry, which is no where near a curry, let alone green. Other orders are cold, they are generic concoctions are over priced. On top of it, they do NOT have sushi for the next couple days, but there is no sign or pre warning about that. They just blurt it out after you are ready to order. Total disaster, scam chinese... Do not even try!"}
{"text":"China Palace is a Sewickley staple restaurant- at one point I ate here almost every week. The food is still great- I just live in California now. 

Fried and steamed dumplings are great, Singapore rice noodles, and kung pow chicken are all worth ordering. ALSO wontons in hot sesame sauce- so delicious.

Wait staff is always wonderful and helpful! Doris the owner is a great lady."}
{"text":"When I lived in Shadyside I would order from China Palace once a week. It was in my Walnut Street restaurant rotation. I have taken out and have had dinner there. I have had most of the Chicken dishes, with Broccoli, Snow Peas, Cashew, Sweet & Sour, Mixed Veg, the Fried Rice and other Chicken dishes. I have not had a bad experience. I have only ordered or dined, during the dinner hours. I do understand the mix reviews, but I have not had any major issues to complain or comment on. The service could be a little quicker, but having it fresh made to me has always been worth it. It is worth the try."}
{"text":"Really good quick Chinese. I love on the other side of Harris and will pass several Chinese spots to come to this one. The food is good and the service is great. They really treat customers well."}
{"text":"3.5*

Dropped in the family run restaurant on a weekday for an early lunch or late dinner...which ever way you wanna take a 3pm meal!

Ordered their lunch special for $8.99 which came with a entree, rice, soup and a spring roll. The spring roll was nice and hot when I got it...filled with good veggies!

The hot and soup sour wasn't spicy or sour enough, more pepper than anything. 

The manchurian chicken was good according to my partner but I found the sauce lacking the coriander taste with too many chili peppers. 

I'd still go to my all time favorite hakka in sauga but if I was in the area again I would drop by if I was really craving Hakka.

Service was pretty decent and there seem to be more than one regular."}
{"text":"Always great service.  Great variety of true Chinese food in a light and pretty atmosphere.  Food is fresh and delicious!  True repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 'meh'.  I have eaten here more than once.  

Food is ok.  Service is ok.  

It's quick.   At least its got that goin' for it."}
{"text":"Peking duck was done perfect. Crispy skin, soft pancake wraps, fresh onion. Wait for food was on par with prep. 4 out of 5 because nobody gets a 5. Never that awed. But SOLID 4."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I ordered the beef with garlic sauce, combo lo mein, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, eggs rolls and crab puffs. My friends all loaded up their plates and as soon as they tasted a bite of everything, we all threw it away. The chicken was rough, all the sauces were super sweet, beef did not taste like beef, the \"crab puffs\" were fried wontons with a speck of cream cheese...it was all gross. I literally threw away $55. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the eggrolls were decent"}
{"text":"excellent vegetarian menu.  the garlic sauce was a bit on the sweet side and the brown rice charge ($1.50 extra/entree) is a bit high but the prep quality is top tier.  well worth keeping their menu on hand for any takeout cravings..."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town!!!!!!!!! Chef Gary rocks. Lou is good. Grace is sweet. And concierge Chuck is what seals the deal! $2 upcharge for sushi brown rice is insulting, but I will never win that battle with the owner (I've been fighting it for 10 years). A good business owner... she knows I'll pay it and keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt, and I've gotta say, guys, I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose, then, I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food but most of the entrees are way too overpriced comparably speaking for what it is. The sushi was some of the worst that I've had."}
{"text":"China palace is a decent indian Chinese/ Hakka restaurant.. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.. It's not to die for..
They're service is mediocre and if you're looking for tasty spicy food you can't always count on it.. 
Not my favourite Hakka restaurant.."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick meal and ordered the triple delight.

The pro's:

- Service was great
- The restaurant was clean
- The price was good


The meh's:
- Food was bland (I ordered my meal to be extra spicey)

Overall - I will be back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I crave Chinese food at least once a week and wanted to try something different from the usual place I always go to. Ordered for pick up, price is decent and food was nice. I ordered orange chicken combo which includes plain fried rice, a cream cheese puff and a veggie egg roll. The lady said I would be getting soup with my order also but I never got it. I didn't really care about the soup honestly though.The portions are filling, this isn't my favorite Chinese place but it would be my second choice. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The best Chinese that delivers to Oakland I've had so far. Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty."}
{"text":"Really good food and exceptional service. They are my go to for a quick and decent meal... Lunch specials are really good value. The décor is dated, but who cares when the food is this good or you're having it delivered?! An added bonus, you can order from Sushi Too menu and eat it here - apparently they are owned by the same family."}
{"text":"We went there last night, based on the excellent reviews, but thought it was mediocre, at best. There was only one person waiting tables, so we had to wait a long time to place and receive our order. When we got our food, we found it all to be quite bland. We had wonton and hot and sour soups, sesame chicken, General Tso's chicken and moo shu pork."}
{"text":"I've gotten food from here twice. Once through grub hub and it took over an hour for them to deliver. The one time that I ate there, I was surprised to find out that the interior is very nice and they give you hot tea with your meal! Prices are high for Chinese cuisine, but the food was superb and there's a ton of options, including vegan ones with seitan, soy protein, and tofu!"}
{"text":"Worse than any mall food court I've ever been in. Nothing is fresh. Floor looks like a flea market is held here at night."}
{"text":"7:30 p.m. - I made my order at 5:30. Chicken fried rice, cream cheese puffs, and a sprite. Easy. 1.5 hours later, I called to see where my order was, and a young lady asked my name, took a second, and told me \"IT IS ON IT'S WAY!\"
Great.
30 minutes go by, nothing.
I call again, she asks for my name, I hear \"It's on it's way\" in the background, then silence, then \"we never received your order\"

WHAT?! Then why did you tell me it was on the way? I could have made my order at 7 when I called and gotten the food by now. Nope. They wanted to lie to keep me happy.

I am pregnant and on a medication where I cannot eat after 8 pm. 

7:40 - Got my meal
The chicken is all dark meat., and for a \"large\" it's not that much. Theres practically nofilling in the cream cheese puffs and my sprite was a fountain drink in a Styrofoam cup. Not trhilled.  Empire Asian Bistro was better. I'm from New York, I know good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Quick service. Made to order Chinese restaurant with hakka options.

I have been here a handful of times. It's not the best Chinese food but it does the trick. My go to dishes are the garlic fried shrimp and Cantonese noodles (crispy)."}
{"text":"Staying in Mesa for work and I decided to get delivery. I was able to place an order right from Yelp, with cash. Delivery was early, food was hot and delicious and for under $20 I got more food than I could eat!!! Thank you China Palace, for a great meal!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say I've ever been impressed with any delivery Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh. I'm not expecting anything crazy, but I have had quality American Chinese food and a little flavor/quality goes a long way.

Our delivery order was over $40 for 2 entrees, veggie wonton soup and 2 veggie egg rolls. For the quality of this food, that is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for the quantity and quality of the food. We could have gone to many other places around the city and gotten a quality meal for that price.

We ordered General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli, one $13 and the other $14. I wasn't overly impressed by either... both were pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Honestly I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between the two meats if I was blindfolded... they didn't taste different at all! The broccoli was cooked well and still had a nice crunch to it.

The egg rolls were ok, but it's kind of impossible to mess those up. I was really excited that they had Veggie wonton soup. It had been so long since I've had wonton soup because I don't eat pork, but the broth was extremely bland and I found myself adding a ton of salt and pepper to flavor it.

This is only one of 2 places that will deliver to the Polish Hill area, so it looks like I'll be going for take-out next time."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the \"city that sleeps\"). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area."}
{"text":"We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good, and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty consistent as well. They even called me back once to double check something on the order. That was really nice. Delivery times are always good, and they're very fast on slow days. Meals in the restaurant or also high-quality. My wife and I have probably eaten here 40 times in the last five years."}
{"text":"We have been going to China Palace for almost 10 years and haven't been able to find a better Chinese food restaurant in the area. Take out orders always take 10 minutes. We order the chicken lo mein and egg drop with wonton soup almost every time since it's so good. We live about 20 minutes away from China Palace now but still keep coming back since all of the closer places don't compare."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for Hakka food, hot, spicy fish pakoras, spicy noodles, spicy fish dishes, hot and sour soup...this is where I like to go. The spicy dishes are where these guys really shine. Service is fast and efficient, there are lots of tables and parking is ample. 3.5 stars is where I might have landed because it doesn't have a lot of ambiance but it does have a loyal following and with good food at reasonable prices, I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had low expectations during a visit here for a business lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The food was quite tasty and reasonably priced at lunch. The best? No. But worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I seen the low rating at first but I am very glad I came in pursuit of a Hakka place. I had the hot and sour soup to start, which might be the best I've had ever! Then we had some chicken pakora which also didn't disappoint. My main was the Manchurian Beef and boy was that ever amazing!! Beware that when the menu says the good is spicy, it sure is! If you can't handle the heat, make sure you ask for a mild version. 
Stellar place!!!"}
{"text":"I would have giving zero star but that was not an option. This has always been a very fun and good place to come eat for the 22 yrs we have lived in Mesa. It was a fun place for our family to go. 

However, tonight, a Saturday night in the hot summer when there were only 2 guests in the whole place they refused to seat our family party of 8. There was plenty of room and no line. We were told because it was Saturday they could not push tables together. This was not acceptable and we left.

Normally I would not think much of it but this is the Saturday before Father's Day. Our family came to spend Father's Day together at this place. Holidays are very difficult for our family as our 21 yr old daughter died 6 yrs ago. Our granddaughter loves the soup here and we thought it would be a fun memory to make.

SHAME ON YOU! SHAME...ON...YOU for having no compassion and accommodating our family. We will never be back again. Your lose"}
{"text":"Tried vegetable fried rice with soy protein, and got food poisoning ... the fried rice was extremely oily. And I suspect that they didn't clean up the fried pan regularly or somehow reuse the oil. Anyway, no matter what, I wish the restaurant can improve the quality of food. If you have sensitive stomach like me, this place is probably not a right place to go."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot since it's very quick & convenient, but my roommate and I found something scary in the lo mein and never went back."}
{"text":"An interesting mix, Szechuan, Hakka. And Indian dishes.
Good spices in all the dishes we tried with the exception of the Pad Thai noodles. These were a little sticky and not very spicy.
The pakoras are tue to the cuisine and tasty.
Next time we are passing through, we'll stop by again.
It's not a glamorous spot but clean and very personable wait staff."}
{"text":"Very rarely am I as disappointed as I was tonight.  Poor customer service.  Long wait.  Utensils were thrown on table.  Out of 14 people, only 4 of us got glasses for water.  The food was over priced, low quality, and the servings were small.  Noodles were mushy.  Just disappointed across the board!  Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Pretty average chinese food here. We ordered spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, egg foo young, and Shanghai Noodles. All were pretty yummy and the noodles were very spicy!

Although they were pretty packed it was still a nice quite spot with calm dim lights. 

The waitstaff was super nice and we were able to get a discount for paying with cash versus debit/credit. So that was pretty cool."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the quality of food served but the portion was very generous just like most Chinese restaurants. We had wonton soup and potstickers for appetizers. They weren't disappointing but didn't impress me either. The chicken and fish fillet we ordered turned out to be decent. Both dishes tasted fairly authentic to me. The meat was tender and the fish tasted fresh. Not sure if I'll come back again though..."}
{"text":"I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars, but I am not sure yet... 

I avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . 

I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. 

They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. 

Last night, I tried the \"Sizzling Sensation\" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. 

Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the \"Taro Bowl A-La-King.\" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... 

If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or \"weight watchers\" items. That goes for just about anywhere! 

Delivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Super-friendly staff. Soy protein with broccoli was suh. Flippin. Good. I was with 2 meat-eaters that loved it too. Go to their website for full menu --I don't see it here on Yelp, but we got it 2 days ago.

Reviewer below is right--menu wording is a little confusing. The vegetable/tofu dishes are not necessarily vegetarian. But the vegetarian dishes are (duh). So are some of the other things (noodles, appetizers, etc.)

To summarize: It's good. Go!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here on several occasions, both dine in and take out.  Every time, the food has been tasty, fresh and fantastic.
I love their hot and sour soup and the crispy walnut shrimp are heavenly.  
They have an extensive menu and always have a full sheet of specials as well.  A lot more options than a typical Chinese restaurant.  They also have a full bar."}
{"text":"Best Hakka Restaurant for sure!

I have been coming to China Palace for as long as I can remember. I have tried all the Hakka places you can think of but I keep coming back to China Palace. 

The owners are so nice and the staff is great. The use to have a location in woodbrige which sadly closed down (it was closer for me) Even though it's quite a trek for me to get to china Palace, it is worth the drive. The building is a little rough and the restaurant is clearly outdated but the food speaks for itself.

My Favourites are:
Veggie Pakora- kind of has a sweet and sour taste to it, prefer over the chicken!
ManChow soup- a little spicy but always a favourite 
Chilli chicken- I like mine with light gravy, more on the drier side 
Crispy ginger beef- a little on the sweeter side but sooooo good!
chilli Green beans- beans are filled with flavour and are still crisp
Manchurian eggplant- even if you don't like eggplant you will love this!
Shrimp with lobster sauce- thick gravy lots of meat

You must try!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time user of Yelp but didn't ever feel the need to create an account and review a restaurant. Until now. This place is disgusting. Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I ordered the lunch special with wonton soup and beef and broccoli. The soup broth was oddly thick and they put the crispy wontons in the soup, so when I went to eat it, there were soggy wonton strips floating around. 

The beef? Inedible. It tasted rotten and disgusting. I picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice. I've noticed the Pittsburgh Chinese food scene isn't great but this place is by far the worst. Stay away"}
{"text":"I had been to this place before and it was fine. I went last week and got the worst food poisoning of my life, definitely avoid!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll toss this place one extra star.  I guess I shouldn't let one bad (repeatedly bad, though,) server kill the whole place's reputation.

The reason I gave in?

They use legit-style Tofu! Oh mercy me, I'm gettin' the vapors just thinkin' about it!

I have to give them credit for that.  Also, the reasonably-priced lunch special really saved the day on a hungover Saturday morning.

BUT let us not think the entire picture has changed.  I'd like to dock them half a star if I could, because they charged me $2 for an egg roll! Insaaaaaane! It wasn't even that good."}
{"text":"My bf picked up Chinese since I mentioned that I was craving some. We just moved to this area from out of state. Chinese food is scarce around here ! He bought shrimp lo mein which came with a fried rice, a cream cheese wonton and a veggie eggroll. Ehh.. The wonton was seriously lacking filling.  The eggroll was pretty mushy inside,  maybe sat around too much.  The shrimp lo mein had good flavor and shrimp was plump and not overcooked.  But it was overall pretty over seasoned or salty. I couldnt keep eating.  

The only pro would be that they deliver.  Otherwise I'll keep searching for a good Chinese joint to satisfy the need next time."}
{"text":"As I was thinking about writing this review I am debating ordering China Palace take-out. Obviously I'm a fan. They are quick with take out and prices are fair and food is great. I've never had a bad meal. I love the sushi selection."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Delivery took well over an hour. We had to call to remind them of our order twice. No apology from delivery man. Our food was cold."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for the 1st time. The place is nice & clean looking. Nicer than most small Chinese restaurants I've been to. 

I ordered the sesame chicken meal with \"fried rice,\" house special lo mein, & 2 egg rolls. $21.63. They give you a good amount of sesame chicken & lo mein. & how Heather M. said the fried rice is just white rice covered in soy sauce. 
Their egg rolls are different too, well the outside is, & they were dry. 

The lady who checked me out was nice.
I wouldn't say this is the best Chinese place I've been to & not the worst."}
{"text":"Ok, so normal delivery form this place is maybe a 3-4.  After the current experience I would give a ZERO for the food and management if possible.  I ordered the Pu Pu platter of appetizers.  When I opened it, the spring rolls, tempura shrimp and crab puffs were covered in a sauce.  the shrimp was soggy but ok, the crab puffs were mushy and gross and the spring rolls were disintegrating! LITERALLY!  Who covers deep friend finger food appetizers with sauce...especially spring rolls?

So I called in to let them know how bad it was and after a side consultation the answer I got was simply, that is the way we do it.  I tried to explain how that made no sense to deliver soggy, disintegrating food and that I personally found it gross and threw it away and the only reply I could get was, sorry, that's how we do it.  Not even an apology!!!

I will never order from here again.  So much options they had to work with to take care of this order...just even an apology for the customer not liking it!!!  NOTHING!!

So the food is generally ok, but with management practices like this, I cannot support a business that is so customer unfriendly.  Next time its pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The service in this place sucks! The waiters are freaking rude! They really need to learn how to behave with customers. Apart from the wings, this place is a hell NO!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and decor. The food taste fresh and serving sizes are worth the price.  The General Tso was very tasteful and not too spicy. The sesame chicken was good and tasted like it should."}
{"text":"Your kidding me right? This place is so nasty .. And the food? The what? They take the \" C\" out of China... First this place smelled? Not sure if it was urine or cat p**** HUh.... then I get the order . When I treid to explain it was hard for them to understand that HEY I did not order this What do you not understand ? I order (translate)   number 6 not 11 I know for some people that is hard to understand .
                 If this simple one person order gives you problems then maybe you should try something else ? Walmart greeter? Or maybe one of those people that gives out the free sample at stores? On second thought maybe not.... that is to much to understand .. 1) Open box  2) Place on plate  3) Put in microwave 4) hit 'On \" for 3 minutes .

        There are to many places that have much better food  like well... Any where else...."}
{"text":"I enjoy ordering delivery or take out from this restaurant. The food is always consistent and if you eat there, the staff is kind and attentive. They have a big menu and I have learned through 4 years of ordering many different items off of their menu, that some things they are good at and others not so much. I really enjoy their handmade steamed dumplings, pad Thai, and all of their Thai style curries."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast, and nice quiet dining room. The tofu and veggie dish is perfection. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I just ordered for the 1st time, the food was DELICIOUS, delivery was fast and the service was great!!! The only issue was the portion size of fried rice, it wasn't enough! Overall worth the money and I will definately order again!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and the food was really good. I had the chicken lomein and the eggdrop soup and it was really good."}
{"text":"Seems my Fav is under new management. The folks are nice, but the recipes have changed, the flavors have muted. I've tried 3 times and my old stand bys of Kung Pao Chicken, Shanghai Noodle Soup and Special Fried Rice are ghosts of their delectable pasts.

RIP China Palace. I'll give you another shot in a few months before completely writing you off."}
{"text":"I've had the seasame chicken, fried rice, and lo mein. All were so good and you get a ton of food! Favorite Chinese place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST chinese food place in Madison and probably the midwest (since we've lived in Saint Paul, MN too and there doesn't seem to be any good Chinese food anywhere- except maybe in Chicago).  This is the place where Chinese people eat.  We've been there many times and always take friends there.  The venue is huge- plenty of parking and table space.  They even have different rooms for large groups.   The cold jellyfish dish is one of our favorites- but it is an acquired taste.  The mao po tofu is fresh and delicious.  Another favorite is the scallops as well as the greens with oyster mushroom dish.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. 

When you go in, you don't see anyone sitting. The place was empty. . Was a bit sceptic with the empty ess.
Once you are seated you see people come and go to take their take out orders. Design is not bad either. Very quiet place

We took fried shrimp wonton but it was under cooked in the middle. We told the server and he quickly apologized and brought us new one and well cooked. 

We took the hakka chowmein special, the chicken lollipops and the fried rice. They were really good. And they are very affordable prices and the portions were good.

I was so hungry and it was so good, I forgot to take pictures  will take pictures for next visit"}
{"text":"Great place with great Hakka food. I've been coming here since 1994. I love their version of hot and sour soup, best I've had anywhere. The portions are generous and the prices very reasonable. Their Singapore noodles are one of my favourite dishes as are the fish pakoras."}
{"text":"I like this place. I have ordered here for delivery once and pick up once. I have not eaten inside. When I had it delivered the delivery guy brought a dog treat for my dog. which was awesome!!! The food is good. My Husband loves the food. I love that they deliver"}
{"text":"I love this place, they have the BEST Hot & Sour soup I've tasted.  Love everything I have tried.  My favorite Chinese food restraunt"}
{"text":"Yep, the place is terrible. It definitely reminds me of my undergrad days when $5 was what we could spend for dinner. Unfortunately, this place charges a lot more than $5 for dinner.  

I got the General Tso chicken which was extremely deep fried but I don't have super high expectations there and hey I wanted fried food which is why I ordered it. One of my dining companions returned a dirty dish. Mine just had water on it so I wiped it clean with a napkin.

Another companion went for the famous Peking Duck. In the menu, the duck is supposed to be served and cut table side. Turns out it was served cut and on the plate there was what seemed like an orange painted chicken. I could imagine it being a very small duck but honestly, it didn't taste a bit like chicken! It wasn't even tasty. Just bland, boiled kind of chicken meat. Did I mention that the duck also comes with a high price tag.

Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place near my work, I tried it today for lunch and I am already looking forward to going back! I had the special, made w/chicken, beef ,shrimp, veggies in a brown sauce w/a side of rice. It was so tasty! My SO had twice cooked beef and enjoyed his as well. Loved the cream cheese puffs, the spring rolls were very fresh and crispy. Our server was super sweet and appropriately tentative. It wasn't busy when I was there (2 pm) but I did notice several people coming in to pick up take-out orders. OH! And very reasonably priced, $15 for two lunches w/water to drink. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is my childhood and I can honestly say I have never had better Chinese food than the stuff I get here. In high school I liked to bring friends to China Palace and they loved it when I did that because it was so great. If you're gluten free like I am, this place is good for that. They can substitute the regular soy sauce with gluten free soy sauce for you in any dish. I just miss being able to have the amazing egg rolls they have here. I recommend those as well as the chicken with Chinese vegetables and the shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here probably 20 times or more over the past 3 years or so and we've never had a bad experience. The food is always good, comes out hot, and is decent quality. I've never had a bad meal not bad experience. A great go-to option for oriental food."}
{"text":"I love how close China Palace is. Its always very quiet there. The tea is good. As are the prices and the dishes. Love my fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. There is no pineapple in the sweet and sour but the chicken is done right.  :)"}
{"text":"Moving from the Midwest, I was pumped when I found this place at their former location in Squirrel Hill and discovered their vast vegetarian menu. General Tso's soy protein is a winner, although a bit sweet. They retained their veg menu at their Shadyside site and it's the same. Lunch is the way to go here--very expensive otherwise. Beware of soup--kind of got congealed in transit. 

Overall, this place holds a special place in my heart as it's very veg-friendly. However there are better Chinese places in PGH."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today  food was very good I had the chicken with cashews. Asked for it spicy and they made it perfect. Wife had seafood with vegetables she liked it. Staff friendly and soup was tasty
Will return soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here--actually, it was our first meal in our new home of Pittsburgh.

I really expected it to be better than it was.  It was cheap, fast, and the service was good but the food just didn't wow me.  There was nothing WRONG with it, but it was just middle-of-the-road americanized Chinese lunch special.  (Which I suppose I can't complain about, since I knew that when I ordered it.)

That being said, this Chinese place has an amazing vegetarian selection!  I'm not just saying that because I moved from Omaha, beef capital of the universe.  I ordered General Tso's tofu for lunch--and I could have ordered General Tso's soy protein!  Ha!

I would come back here, maybe, if I was looking for a quick bite in Shadyside.  But for now I think I'll stick to trying other Chinese places in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"We always order from here. Takeout and delivery. Haven't had anything that I hadn't liked yet. Foods always hot and fresh. And oh, there wings. Definitely  order them. So crispy and good."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown Sewickley, the China Palace is a great option for sushi and Chinese Food.  I met someone here for a business meeting and was quickly seated near the window and enjoyed a lot of natural sunlight from the large windows.
Many options and specials for sushi and sushi rolls.  Service is quick and the food is good."}
{"text":"Almost everything was good: the fried rice (as it must be at any decent chinese restaurant), Chili chicken, sweet and sour fish.  We didn't like the corn soup.  I call that a decent success rate, and I'll be adding this place to my list of reliable locals."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very convenient to our home. I love Chinese food, but the last several times I've ordered, despite my requests, my food is never prepared as I've asked, over and over again. I don't know if the order taker doesn't communicate with the kitchen or if the chef ignores or can't or refuses to adjust the spiciness. It's not just me, my son and his wife have the same experience. It seems as I have no choice, but to quit ordering from China Palace. They just don't seem to listen or care."}
{"text":"We are still going back to this place and becoming even better friends with the man who runs around all the time.  Maybe we will end up learning his name!  Last time we went there, we talked with him about basketball (and all sports, really), and even though we stopped caring as much as he did, we were really happy that he took the time to talk to us.  The service here is out of this world, really in terms of it being quick, and the man who runs around is really nice when you get to know him!  We still have no reason to go anywhere else when we want Chinese food (which has become quite frequently)!  Why go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the area. The only other place that even compares to this is a good 15-20 minutes away, and this place is cheap, quick, and consistently good tasting. The lunch specials are a great deal, and it's one of the only Chinese places in the area that I haven't had issues with, or had to wait 15 minutes for my food after arriving, even though I called it in. So I will definitely be returning to China Palace."}
{"text":"Always quiet and never have to waIt for a table. Food is always fresh and hot.  They just started charging for tea $2.00pp....that was surprising.  They also charge if you want another bowl of white rice and there is an upcharge for brown rice.  Their food is good - always fresh and hot whenever it comes to the table.  They have new menus - maybe that's why they started adding these extra charges.  One dish is enough for two people to share and be full.  Everything we've ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"That's the lowest on here. I love to eat, and I can distinguish flavored , etc but this place by far the worst one I have ever been too. Take it for what it's worth. I will not be coming here."}
{"text":"Good food mmmmmmmmmm nice staff everything is super yum fresh your food gets delivered on time and fresh and hot... So check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"I absolutely love there chilli chicken lunch special. The best part is the steamed vegetable option instead of rice."}
{"text":"I really love this place and the vegetarian choices are the best!!!! taste is awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, food is great, and the staff is amazing. When I order take out the guy who delivers to my house is so sweet and always brings a treat for my dog. It's a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times when in Pitt visiting my son and his wife.  Clean fast and very tasty.  Service was fast and courteous.  Portion size is nice, love the extensive menu choices.   Also very clean each time I've been here.  Recommend it as a must try."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! And the staff is super nice as well :)"}
{"text":"????????????????"}
{"text":"I ordered the general tsos(all time fav) and the sesame chicken for lunch. I wanted to try both and see which would come out in top. The fried rice had no taste and was dried out....I might has well have been chewing on the box. The chicken was terrible. It was stringy and had no taste. The sauce was nowhere to be found. I love Chinese food and I couldn't even finish the food. I am not a fan of this place. I tried to reheat it the next day and it looked like it had been in the fridge for over a week. Never again."}
{"text":"The reason I like China Palace is the cheap lunch special (11-3pm). Comes with rice, hot and sour soup, and choice of meat. The restaurant has a mellow vibe and there's a bar to watch sports. Service is delightful, especially the ol lady! The full menu offers many options but overall the food is just meh."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. At this point, one star is being generous. The flavor has left all of their food and the service has tanked. 

This used to be my go to for chineese food in shadyside. After a noticeable drop in quality, i started ordering elsewhere. Today I went out on a limb and officially ordered my last meal from this restaurant. 

Living right down the street this used to be quick and reliable food. They used to have some of my favorite chineese food in the city. I have no idea what happened.

Today, it took an hour and a half to get food that was pretty much inedible. My girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish. I had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli. One of the better things we ordered was the hot and sour soup which was dull and only slightly offensive. The best thing we ate, apart from the stale fortune cookies, was one of the greasiest egg rolls I ever had. Unfortunately, we threw out most of our entrees.

It's truly sad to see a place that used to be so good lower their standards like this. I will not be ordering here ever again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a couple of times and it seems to be a pretty average Chinese place.  Most of the options are typical Americanized sorts of things with few more traditional or authentic Chinese options.  The sauces for me seem overly sweet and syrupy, especially for the General Tso's chicken.  I would like to see more spice and complex flavors and less sauciness.  They do have a large assortment of vegetarian options and vegetarian version of typical dishes with soy or wheat gluten.  I do really like their scallion pancake appetizer.  Service was good and food came out quickly.  Hot tea is included."}
{"text":"My husband and 2 yr old daughter went there for a lunch. We arrived at noon and the place was complete empty, but we witnessed a transformation as it got full by the time we left. The staff was helpful and prompt to bring a straw for my daughter to have her water. We shared a palace duck, which consists n boneless strips of duck with stir fried veggies (broccoli, baby corn, bamboo, the usual) covered with sauce. It was not memorable but definitely heartwarming and a good choice for a quick Sunday family lunch. We also had fried pork dumplings for appetizer and egg drop soup, which were average.

The general Tso chicken we spotted on another table seemed to be a popular choice and looked tasty; next time we will try that one for sure."}
{"text":"Don't spend your money here. I called to place an order & there was no assistance on how I could order my food but have it placed in a specific container...
To be specific. If I request my vegetable fried rice in a Chinese box container with the handle vs a styrofoam box, just figure out how to make it happen. It's a box...

GO TO HOUSE OF LENG!"}
{"text":"I love this little place.  There is never a wait, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The food is yummy!  Even get it for take out and you will be happy!!"}
{"text":"Chinese food for white people. 

You can tell they have some skill in cooking, and the ingredients tasted fresh... but it's extremely Americanized Chinese food. The flavors taste seriously wrong to a Chinese palate. 

If you're white and prefer lighter/less oily psuedo-Chinese fare, it's one of the better places I've tried.

3 stars because I'm Chinese."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetable and rice lunch special.

The vegetables were overcooked and the rice tasted a day or two old.

Perhaps it was an off day. Still, I'll take my $$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place benefits from the lack of competition and we suffer. Not very friendly. Food substandard (my chicken fried rice was cold and lacked ingredients and flavor). I asked if they had Coca-Cola and was told yes, but it was clearly a Pepsi. Irritating to someone who hates Pepsi."}
{"text":"I ordered the Manchurian chicken extra spicy and it barely had any spice to it, it also tasted so salty that I was not enjoying the food.

I also ordered the chicken pakoras and tried to ask for it to be extra spicy as well, and they could not accommodate that. I was a little confused by that. The flavour was good however, it had a bit of a tandoori taste to it which was nice, but in its entirety, was just okay.

I would not come back here."}
{"text":"I will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian Chinese food! Plus they deliver to my apartment.

I got the Kong Pao Wheat Gluten & Veggie Lo mein. It wasn't excessively spicy, but enough to make it flavorful. I ordered this for myself....I had a HUGE plate of both with some white rice & a spring roll. I literally still have enough for 2 more meals. With a total of $22.50, it was the best quick & tasty Sunday dinner for a non-meat eater!"}
{"text":"So many great vegan / vegetarian options! Lunch specials are seriously a great deal!!! I prefer the soy protein to the Other vegi options. I love the kung pow soy protein and the lemon \"chixn \" can't get the lemon for lunch. 

It's a bit Americanized yes, but when your up for that it is a 10."}
{"text":"Great food, not greasy and every time tastes fresh. Also very quick on delivery orders."}
{"text":"Seriously what wrong with this place, horrible terrible food, although portions are generous but of no use. All I could taste was salt. First they have no fix timings, they can come to your table at 9:10 PM for last order whereas actual timings mentioned were open until 10:00 PM. Than is it impossible for them to understand your orders, we clearly said \"No Eggs\" in anything we ordered, but they easily choose to ignore that. When we showed them the eggs, they just said sorry and left... seriously? Did not change the order or replaced. And food of-course is mixture of MSG, water and salt."}
{"text":"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \"chicken\" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.

I was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.

The service was friendly enough, though. 

Not to be recommended unless you're desperate."}
{"text":"This place seriously has the fastest delivery I have ever seen! Faster than any jimmy johns in fact! She told me my order would take 40+ minutes but in reality the food was at my hotel room within 10. I ordered all the cliché to-go Chinese food: General Tso chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, and crab rangoons. The food was pretty good. But definitely this five star rating goes the delivery speed."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had in ages. We ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout. The eggrolls were the best part since they were edible. Eggdrop soup tasted like soap and the Palace soup which cost 6.95 had almost nothing in it aside from 2 rotten tasting shrimp. We were afraid to try the wonton soup. Overall we paid almost 18 dollars for what amounted to a bag of garbage."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Service was great! Wasn't very busy when we were there a few other tables nice and quiet and clean atmosphere. We got the general tso chicken, chicken and broccoli,egg rolls,and veggie lo mein and of course the oolong tea! This is the 1st night I have ate Chinese in probably 8+ years! Definitely was a great meal to get me back to eating Chinese! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I became a fan of this place gradually... now I go there almost twice a week! The food is just delicious. I didn't like the food for the first time, but I tried again and now couldn't let it go anymore..."}
{"text":"We visited early on a Saturday at 4:56pm which is a great time to go. Great service and fast for the time of day. They have a steamed meat and vegetable option for dishes which are great healthy options. Sushi was freshly made - highly recommend spicy tuna. During holidays and busier times, reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chinesse places around.  Great service, great food and they deliver. I have been going for years and not have had a bad time.  Definitely worth going once or twice a week. 

My favorite meal when going is there chicken and green beans. I like to try to stay on he healthier side and they give you many options to accomplish my goals. Their menu is also very vast and can come back 50 times and still try something new."}
{"text":"In East Mesa, you have to lower your standards for Chinese food or you will always be disappointed. Even knowing that this place wouldn't be outstanding, I went in optimistically. I should have taken the hint from being the only people in there on a Friday night at 6:30. Hands down, the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. I mean for real, this place was such a let down. Even the sketchy New China a mile down the road is quite good in comparison. Go somewhere else. Go anywhere else. Except if you're in their free-delivery area, then why the **** not. Actually, just get some frozen Chinese from Walmart, you'll like it more."}
{"text":"We go here quite often. Everyone is very kind, and the wait is never unbearable. Really great Chinese food - best in the area! Can be a tad pricey, but portions are huge. I usually split an entree with my daughter."}
{"text":"This is our kids absolute favorite...we order almost every Saturday night. The food is always great, delivery is extremely fast, and they are willing to do special orders. For great basic Chinese this is your place!  Order delivery, pick a great movie and enjoy!"}
{"text":"At first I thougt the waiter was so rude he just pointed here and there without saying a single word, but then I found hes quite efficient and considerable. Food is cheap here and the portion is REALLY HUGE, Im kinda shocked lol. But well the fried rice is only okay, no difference from other similar Asian restaurants"}
{"text":"Went here on christmas, so it was understandably busy. However, we waited almost an half hour for egg rolls, and then an additional twenty minutes for the three dishes we ordered. One of the dishes was cold, and my Kung Pao chicken seemed as if it was pre made chicken and they just dumped pre made sauce on it; about 50% of the dish was celery, which in my opinion should be a majority of chicken. Our server was not very personable and quickly rushed away from our table as soon as we ordered.

The last time we were here about two years ago it was very good, but I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the service and food this time."}
{"text":"This place was nothing special, just another run of the mill forgettable Chinese restaurant. I got my order of chicken pad Thai to go. I was eating it within 10 minutes of leaving the restaurant, but sadly it was already luke warm at best. The flavor was good, not the best, but better than fast Asian food. Luckily the bowl was packed full of noodles, so it lasted me two meals. Unfortunately it was pricey for the quality. It cost $11.75. My friend was disappointed in her Chinese food. My honest opinion, for the additional $2-3, I would rather have Nicki's Thai or Panda Express for cheaper.

The menu has several unique names, but doesn't give a description describing these items. My food did come out very quick, but came out so fast that it had to be pre-cooked and just being kept warm."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place on Walnut Street many times without so much as a glance.  But when I returned to Pittsburgh after a trip to DC, I was tired and hungry.  I remembered I had an All Menus coupon for takeout, and China Palace was one of the participating restaurants.

This is the friendliest Chinese eatery for a Pittsburgh vegetarian/vegan.  There are tons of dishes with wheat gluten and soy protein in addition to the more standard tofu.  They even offer veggie shrimp on the menu.

I ordered a spinach and seaweed salad, and the Sizzling Sensation, which is wheat gluten and stir-fried vegetables in a very peppery sauce.  The salad was pretty much what you'd expect, and the Sizzling Sensation definitely perked up my taste buds.  I usually love black pepper, but this was a little much for me.  The vegetarian dishes aren't cheap, running around $12-15 for an entree, though the minimum order for delivery is $12.  The portion size provides at least 2, if not 3, servings.

I should also note that I placed this order on Super Bowl Sunday and wouldn't have been surprised if it arrived later than my requested delivery time--but it even arrived a few minutes early."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out as we were headed back home to DC.
Yup...dinner in the car. Anyway the Shrimp with Broccoli was good. The Singapore Noodles was okay.

But we asked them to leave out the MSG so that undoubtedly effects flavor. Either way it was a satisfying dinner as much as one can expect in a car anyway."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had.  Lou, the sushi chef, is so pleasant and a really great chef.  Their lunch combo, $9.95 for 2 rolls under $6, is what I went with today.  I tried their Green Roll with cucumber, avocado, and asparagus and their Shadyside Roll, which was like a Philly Roll.  I liked the Green Roll better because it had the right \"feel\" for sushi; it was crisp and had a nice snap to it.  The cream cheese just threw off the texture of the Shadyside Roll, but it was still good, I'm just not used to cream cheese in my sushi!

I sat at the sushi bar, so I didn't get to experience the tables or the service there, but Lou was attentive and made sure we were taken care of.  It did seem like they were doing a decent business for lunch.  When I worked in Sewickley, a lot of my co-workers would come here.  It's probably for the best that I waited until after I left Sewickley to experience China Palace, otherwise I'd be here every week."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Ordered delivery and they were at my house in 15 minutes. Other times did pickup and they were just as fast!"}
{"text":"I would actually rate this place a 3.5. Lots to choose on the menu... perhaps a bit too much.  However I also understand because they offer Halal and Hakka also.

The lady was nice enough to explain a couple of the dishes that seemed simular.

I ordered the shrimp fried noodle and it was ok... portion was fair.  I felt it was a bit pricey.

If you are going for lunch, ask for their lunch special menu... the prices posted  seem to be a lot more in line.

Outdated furniture but was clean... which is more important if dining in."}
{"text":"Really enjoying this place. Too soon to say but probably my go to place for Hakka Chinese!

The place is clean and seating ranges from booths to tables. Each table consists of utensils, glasses, and condiments. Best o all the entire place is clean (including the washroom).

Iv done mostly take out, with my dine in experience revolving around soup (to kill time). 

For dine in, service was decent. Ordered at the front (coz was doing take out). Got served with water and althought my soup took a lil longer than id expect it wss understandable considering the 7 people in front of me waiting for their big take out orders. I got the small manchow soup (chicken n shrimp). The soup was hot and flavorful and i enjoyed it to the point where I ordered a large soup to go as well.

The next 2 items i ordered were the shrimp in garlic sauce and and the crispy ginger beef.

The shrimp in garlic sauce was delicious! Large portion of large shrimp in a flavorful gravy! The crispy ginger too was yummy but the taste of the shrimp was better. 

Overall, if you are looking for fresh (not 5 min fast food types), falvourful, large portion food at a decent price then yes I would recommend this place! Will definitely come here a lot to try different other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my two friends and their parents. We were a large party, and the restaurant was dead at the time of our arrival. It was difficult to understand the employees, and they seemed disgruntled the entire time. 

I ordered the general tso tofu. My two friends also ordered tofu dishes, and the parents ordered shrimp fried rice and some type of chicken dish. Our meals came after about 45 minutes of waiting, which I feel is too long in a dead restaurant. The portion sizes were extremely generous, and that is where the two stars is coming from. I wish I could give stars for individual categories, but it is what it is. 

My tofu was ok. They use silken tofu, which turns out to be really slimy and squishy. It wasn't the best ever, but it wasn't the worst either. Then again, I am a tofu lover. I wouldn't recommend this to a person trying tofu for the first time ever.

I couldn't finish my meal so I packed it up to go. Everyone else had no problem finishing up theirs, and they seemed happy with the quality. 

If you're in the area and you need to eat, then this place is as good as any for vegans. I've had better, and I would rather make a slightly longer trip to go to the other China Palace in Shadyside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious. The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.

I've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. 

My favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. 

The spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. 

My last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.

China Palace is a win for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is very flavourful, no issues with the meat quality either. Portions are decent as well for the price you pay. I ended up getting the lunch special with chilli chicken and chow mein noodles. Good for those that appreciate spicy food. Only criticism is that the name 'China Palace' is a little misleading as I found it was more Indian fusion.. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner.  Yelp said full bar but when we arrived hostess said no alcohol.  We enjoy a glass of wine with our meal.  Went to our old stand-by Yen Ching's on Power instead.  Three stars for cleanliness.  Hope this review is helpful."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for the last 5 years or so and it's always been superb. Tonight was truly disappointing. Ordered the shrimp and broccoli with lo mein and an egg roll. The egg roll was good but the size was chintzy at best, probably the size of a spring roll. The lo mein and the shrimp and broccoli were both lackluster and bland, truly devoid of seasoning and super heavy on the oil For over $15 it was most certainly not worth it. The 2 stars are for the speedy service, decent customer service and good past experiences. I'm hoping that they had an off night. Judging by the mixed reviews, consistency seems to be a point of contention. Maybe I've just always gotten lucky.  Unfortunately,  this encounter was so subpar that I won't be coming back. I'll be frequenting House of Leng."}
{"text":"The 1st time I ordered from here for delivery they called me after an hour and told me they were out of something I ordered. I said it was fine as I asked if they would substitute something else and they did. Took almost 90 minutes to arrive. I decided to give them another. This time after an hour they called me again and said delivery was taking longer than expected but I could pick up my order if I wanted. I ordered delivery I don't want to pick up my order. I asked if I could cancel my order and the girl seem very flustered and put me on hold then said the chef said they would have it to me within 10 or 15 minutes. Half an hour went by and I finally got my food but when I opened it up they didn't give me any rice. Not sure how Chinese food place can deliver your food and forget the rice. I won't be going back as the food was very subpar this time chicken was overcooked and dry and cold."}
{"text":"The worst ever Chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant!!!
I ordered lo mien with steak, it wasn't even steak and it was cold enough!!
Future actions: will not come again for sure!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to watching Black Panther at a theatre last Saturday. I had enough points to watch it for free, which made my day even sweeter.

It was around 15:00 when the movie had finished. I was ready for lunch. I decided to figure out what eateries were around this Courtneypark Cineplex.

I didn't realize that there are a number of small ones when you walk past Shoeless Joe's and Caffe Demetre. I saw China Palace. I looked at the menu with Hakka items. There was spicy garlic chicken. Perfect!

I walked in. It was pretty quiet. There were perhaps two tables with customers. I simply found a table closest to the window and plopped myself down.

The server came over and gave me a couple of menus. I asked for a Diet Coke to start and continued looking at the menu.

I ordered spicy garlic chicken with gravy. I got white rice with my meal.

I was excited to get my food. The spicy garlic chicken was yummy. I loved the gravy and the kick. There was a decent amount of garlic, which I appreciated. The chicken was tender and yummy.

The white rice was good. There were a few lumps, which reminded me of growing up and having that happen all the time when my mom cooked rice in a pot on the stove. When you put gravy on top of these clumps, it's all good.

I went to pay at the front desk. Payment methods include debit, credit, and cash. I used my debit to pay. I had enough change to leave a decent tip.

The washroom is clean and decently stocked. 

Although I sat away from the door area, the restaurant does get drafty. I still felt the cold whip in when the door was open. It would have been worse if I had sat directly in front of the restaurant's main door.

I'd come back here to try other items on the menu. Perhaps I will come during the weekday and give the lunch special a try.

{"text":"This restaurant has cheap Chinese lunch combos that come with a can of pop and a straw. I tried their beef dish and it was okay. The meat tasted what chewing a piece of paper would be like.

My friends who got fried chicken dishes (e.g. General Tao Chicken) were happy; get chicken."}
{"text":"China Palace is always good. It's our go-to when nobody wants to cook. I love it but you have to be patient on the phone because communication is a little tricky. I love their sushi and the Thai food is not bad. Of course, the Chinese food is always great. They deliver quick which is huge... just the fact that they deliver is awesome! I wish more restaurants in Sewickley would deliver. I take off a star because sometimes, not often, there sushi is mushy.."}
{"text":"Pretty great prices, huge servings, great taste. I got the Orange Chicken, and my boyfriend got the Kung Pao Chicken.  Both were flavorful, crunchy, plenty of sauce, and just the right amount of spice.
The servers were very attentive, and very friendly. 
The only drawback was our appetizers.  The spring rolls were yummy, but the egg rolls were the same size, and tasted the same.  I'm used to egg rolls being way bigger.  We'll just stick to the spring rolls next time."}
{"text":"So we visited this establishment on a nice a lonely night during Christmas break. I did my research on my beloved yelp and should have erred on the side of caution and \"followed my guts\" instinct.  Upon entry I realized this was going to suck...The lounging around nonchalant hostesses slowly took us to a seat, but it wasn't like rocket science, as there was only one other customer and his lady friend chomping on some food. We ordered our soda drinks which came in some real thin cup type things loaded with ice. Did they not have a fountain machine on site??? Not sure. Moreover, it came time to order.....we ordered our dishes and an app. Let me say that the Kung Pao that I ordered was the worse tasting dish I have ever had at any Chinese food place. Cutting corners aren't ya....With about 3 sticks of chopped celery. And a bunch of peanuts....not even real brown sauce. The app we got sucked as well. I felt like walking out after it appeared as though something suspicious was going on when the hippy looking cook came out to chill with the girls....dude this is not an authentic Chinese food place.  I understand that I am in east Mesa...but for real, panda express serves it much better than this place. I WISH I could get refunded the absurd amount of close to 40 bucks I spent on a family of three......for such little food and such a bunk tasting meal. Heck....I can rock the wok much better. We will never return and I will not have a menu for delivery in my humble home. Anyways caveat emptor....yuck..............."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and we had a taste for Chinese food. Found this place on yelp. We were a little worried because of the mixed reviews, but we were glad we gave it a try. I had the sesame chicken and fried chicken wings. Both were delicious. The wings were crispy but not greasy. Sesame chicken was flavorful and a good size portion. I didn't give it 5 stars because I've had better fried rice, but it was good with the sesame chicken sauce mixed in. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered orange chicken and Mongolian beef. Both were very tasty and not overly sweet! Can't ask for much more than that! Great little spot for some yummy Chinese."}
{"text":"I've been going to China Palace on Brown and Recker since I was a kid. It's a small, locally owned, hole in the wall restaurant. As a child my dad was friends with the owners and we were regular-regulars. As of a about 5 years ago, it was bought by new people and we no longer knew the owners. For awhile we stopped going there, but then started again. So Saturday night my dad and I decided we wanted to go back to what had once been our favorite restaurant. As we walked in we were greeted by a friendly girl who asked if we wanted a booth or a table. We were seated immediately and she showed us to our booth. Sitting down, I noticed a bowl of wong tong chips with a side of sweet and sour sauce waiting for us. The same lady who seated us, asked for our drink orders. We went with water and hot tea, considering they have the best hot tea known to man. As we looked through the menu, I decided to go with what I had always gotten as a child. You could say I rarely get something new once I find something I love. Which was the sweet and sour chicken combo with sauce on the side. A new lady came up to our table to take our orders and my dad had ordered the bejing beef and asked the lady if the if the chef could make it as hot as possible. The lady was surprised and asked if he was sure, he confirmed his order and she went off to the kitchen. With our food came soup, my dad ordered hot and sour soup with his and I got egg drop. Might I add the egg drop soup is amazing, especially if you add some soy sauce. Soon after we finished r soup, I noticed the waitress bringing our food out and told us to enjoy. She also asked if we needed anything else besides what we already had. We said no, but thank you as she walked away to help another table. We started to dig in on our food, which both of our servings were enough food for two. I had sweet and sour chicken with sauce on the side that came with an egg roll, a cream cheese puff, and fried rice. Probably one of the best meals I have had in a long time, everything was cook just right and had enough flavor to satisfy my taste buds. I was very happy with the fact that they had the same recipes as when I was a kid, nothing had changed except for the people. My dads helping had came with the same sides with his bejing beef. It was very filling and there was plenty of left overs. Another girl had come over to our table to refill our waters and ask if we needed anything. Soon after, the same woman who had brought us our food came with our checks and fortune cookies. We had paid the woman and were on our way, as we walked out everyone told us to have a good night and said to come back soon. The food was exceptionally priced and tasted fantastic. The service was impeccable, and they waited on us hand and foot. I will be going back without a question, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is the mood for some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout....the service is always fast. The staff is pleasant. The setting is very causal and always clean. Great place for a low key date if you really want to have a conversation during the date. The food is always fresh and tasty. The portions are enough to share. The Hawaiian fried rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"Long time no eat, China P.

I grew up eating this stuff. Not joking. I think my parents took me here when I was 5 years old. I am now 24 (just abouts!) and I still eat at China Palace and love it. You really must come here for their dinner. FAR FAR FAR superior to their lunch!

Portions are fucking massive. And tasty. We spent about $85 for 4 people and still had 2 days worth of leftovers. Hell yes.


PROTIP: If you come here and you secretly wanted to go down the street to Sushi Too instead, rejoice! They are owned by the same people and you can order from Sushi Too if you know what you want (they don't have Sushi Too menus at China Palace, obviously!) They will oblige. That is how cool they are.

Oh, and get the Wonton Soup, Hot Tea, and the Shrimp Soong. You are welcome. ;P"}
{"text":"Best chinese takeout in the area.  It ain't magic, but of the 10 or so places I've tried in Mesa, this one wins."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 3 years now, can't believe i haven't posted a review yet. I'm always wary to try asian restaurants, but this place is delish. I like there fried rice it's the best. sweet and sour chicken is yummy. the owner knows us by face, she knows how often we come here."}
{"text":"the best chinese food of mesa,  very good price , and very good service. I will recommend the chicken soft noodle."}
{"text":"The family went here on a Saturday night.  It's plenty big and roomy.  There is even seating outside.  The menu us extensive and they gave a no kidding sushi chef.  

The service was good and the food was okay.  Good but nothing to write home about.  Actually the tuna sushi was pretty tasty.  I had General Tso's chicken which was not spicy at all but it was good.  

Serving portions are big, definitely for two or take away the next day.

Kids found fried rice and cucumber & avo sushi rolls to dine on.  Everyone seemed pretty happy."}
{"text":"Very good for take out and their ordering for delivery through the Yelp app is convenient."}
{"text":"Been there for dine in and take out. Excellent experience both ways. Actually over the phone they took decent time to provide all the options for the dishes. Good service too."}
{"text":"Good food.  They use good ingredients and present dishes well.  If they weren't in Shadyside, which peaked 40 years ago, they'd get the acclaim they deserve."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered twice from this place and so far we really like it. He loves the orange chicken and I like the sweet and sour chicken. I love the rice that ones with the combo."}
{"text":"Very Good!

Got the Beef Stew in Hot Pot. Pretty Spicy, but so delicious. 
Happy to have found this place on our stopover in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Checking reviews is important to me when finding a good Chinese place in the area. I surfed around Yelp for a few minutes until I found this place. I knew what I wanted, read about it on here and went for it. So that's why I'm writing this review for China Palace. 

I called ahead and placed my order for pick up. The ordering process was super easy and the lady on the end of the phone was very nice. I drove out to the restaurant to pick up my meal and was surprised at how clean and nice the interior was. They have lots of room for dining in if you would like! I proceeded to the counter where i was greeted. Paid for my meal and received it with no issues. The whole interaction was amazing. Very courteous staff and the food was ready at exactly the time they specified. 

Couldn't ask for anything more.. oh yeah! The food was delicious and there was a ton of it!! Decent prices and solid portions. You bet I found my go to Chinese spot in University."}
{"text":"I only go to two Chinese restaurants in Pgh and this is one of them. They offer an impressive Vegetarian Menu with soy protein, wheat gluten, and tofu. They have a nice lunch special too that features several dishes from their regular veg menu, including vegetarian hot and sour soup.

The atmosphere is nice and the place looks much nicer inside than you would expect from the outside. The waitstaff is both nice and attentive and because I eat here a lot, they remember me. 

My boyfriend is neither vegan nor vegetarian but almost always orders soy protein, his favorite is the Orange Soy Protein. 

I recommend the Kung Pao Soy Protein for lunch and Shredded Heaven for dinner. Seriously, you need to try the Shredded Heaven. It's comprised of wheat gluten (seitan), tofu, bamboo shoots, and an assortment of other awesome things."}
{"text":"Best shrimp fried rice ever. Prices are normal but the food is above avg. I try to make it here 2 times a month."}
{"text":"Having been sick with the flu for the past few days I needed a quick lunch that was going to be warming and easy on the stomach, instantly started craving hot and sour soup. University has changed so much in the past 10 years, I wasn't sure were to go so I went to Yelp for advice. Unfortunately I think my fellow Yelpers led me astray once again. 

2:30 on a Thursday this place was empty minus a lady waiting on take out. Came in looked at the menu briefly and had a seat after being directed to do so by the woman at the counter. Five minutes goes by and no one comes up to me to take my order. A gentleman walks in sits down and is promptly waited on. In fact his food came out before I even got to put my order in which is kind of crazy. Ended up getting up and ordering the soup to go since apparently asking for sit-down service in this place is too high of an expectation.

For a $1.70 for lunch I can't complain really with the soup, but I will say it wasn't the most flavorful hot and sour soup. I wouldn't avoid the place at all costs, but I wouldn't be rushing to return either."}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh for 24 years before moving to Texas. China Palace is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to go to for the classic General Tso Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Lo Mein, Mushu, Broccoli Chicken, etc! They don't use MSG in their dishes."}
{"text":"We were reluctant to eat here as we never see a huge crowd. We are sure glad we did as the food was excellent I had the triple delight and it came out piping hot. The service by Paul was excellent.  Give this place a try again if you've been away for a while. Just one recommendation more -wine selections!"}
{"text":"Why did I give it a two and not a one??? Because we have ordered from here before and it's never been this horrible!!! We ordered chow main and got some thing that looked like old cabbage soup!!! The pork pieces looked so gross , not like meet at all!!!  I called back to be told that's what their chow main looked like, that if I antes noodles like Panda Express I'd have to order low main.  Very disappointed . They did offer a credit, but since that won't fix my hunger at this moment I ordered something completely different that I have ordered in the past. Oh and did I forget to mention no fork to eat our food with :("}
{"text":"General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... 

I am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I called for a delivery and I asked if there was any coupons. She said no and I was like okay I'll take what I have and she hung up. I waited one hour for my food and nothing so I called and she said she didn't put it through because of some reason. Then she was like I can do the order now, like it was no big deal she never put my order through and acting like it was my fault."}
{"text":"This review is based on ordering for more than one year at this place and quite constantly. 

Horrendous service. They do not respect your dietary and/or ingredient preferences. 

I have ordered from them several times and the food has been sub-par. If I ever ask for any additional add-ons, they just don't care.

Also if you inform them you want the food to be mild or spicy, they just don't care. It's going to be the same recipe. 

I'd avoid this place. The service is uneven and the food is subpar at this point. You can spend your hard earned dollars to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"China Palace delivers to Moon Township. They charge $2.00 beyond three miles from their establishment. They also charge $1.00 to have the sauce served on the side. I order delivery at least once a month. They have a GREAT delivery service-never late and always correct!  The food is hot at delivery. The only downfall is their chefs are not consistent. I have been eating here for over 15 years."}
{"text":"Can't believe I hadn't tried this place sooner. If you're a vegetarian, this place is AMAZING because they literally have an endless amount of different veg dishes you can choose from and all different kinds of protein substitutes like wheat gluten/seitan, soy, and even veggie shrimp!!"}
{"text":"OK.  So this place seems to have undergone some sort of management change.  All of the old staff is gone and with it the service, cleanliness, and food.  We used to come here regularly but after last night I doubt we'll be going back.  We were greeted quickly and sat at a booth.  However, while we were walking to the booth you could clearly see food on the floor under the table.  No attempt was made to clean the floor.  We ordered Fried Rice which came cold.  The Kung Pao Vegetable plate was OK.  My wife ordered some chicken plate which she said was bland with no flavor.  I don't get it.  Why do restaurant owners forget what they are in business for.  All I want is good food and good service.  This restaurant missed the mark on both counts."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious. Literally one of the better Chinese restaurants in the UNCC area. 

I always order the shrimp fried rice no matter where I go and this is my go to spot that never fails me. Never too greasy or salty and I don't have to add soy sauce for flavor. The boyfriend got the sesame chicken and rice. He said it tasted just \"okay\" but the portion size made up for it. The portions are huge- it usually takes me 4 meals to eat all of it and I'm a big eater!

The prices are noticeably higher than your average Chinese spot but the quality and portion size makes up for it."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! My roommate and I got an orange chicken and a sesame chicken to split because we were afraid of the orange chicken being too spicy, but both were great! They also give you a TON of food. Its more like two servings, so this will be my lunch tomorrow too! We ordered delivery and our apartment has a kinda weird address so I gave them additional instructions and they delivered the food right to our door! It also didn't take the full 45 minutes like they said. It took more like 30, if that! Highly recommend and will order again soon or visit!"}
{"text":"I had the General Tso chicken it was very good. I also ordered crab ragoons that was fantastic. I will be returning"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Chinese in the area. The employees are very kind, and the food is always great."}
{"text":"The chicken garlic sauce taste is gingery taste and the egg fried rice is not have taste , dry . 
The place is quite empty. The menu they advertise on the window the food price is different from the menu inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the lunch special for take out today. Totally not impressed with the portion size that came in the container. We were better off just spending an extra 10 mins to eat there. Spent 30' something dollars on 3 orders which were all the same portion size as this and felt ripped off! Food is delicious but don't do take out!! Eat in only."}
{"text":"I gave this place a three star only because they won't deliver to my house since it's a difficult street so the only time I can get it is when I can eat in or take out. If you can eat in! Friendly staff and delicious fried noodles to snack on! Nice bar from the looks of things! Fast take out and big portions!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the whining is about: we had a fine meal here yesterday. I ordered from the \"Chinese Chef Specials\" as I find that those meals are always more flavorful. That is also where you find authentic flavors and more traditional meals. I ordered the Chinese Spicy Beef. It was hot and pretty spicy beef in a tasty gravy. Delicious and plentiful (I'm eating the leftovers today for lunch.) My husband had the General Tsos. It was hot and tasty although a little too sweet for his liking. My daughter ordered rice noodles with tofu and she was pleased. The flavors were mild but that is her preference. Our friend order sweet and sour chicken. Tasty hot pink sauce (the typical) with nice pieces of chicken in a crispy tempura ( the only thing that matters here is that the tempura was still crispy.) We were all pleased with our meals, the service and the environment."}
{"text":"I liked this place before, but now the quality and value is low and the prices higher.. The lunch special is passable.."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here. I live in a space where I have pretty much only fast food around me, so I have been looking for a place to grab decent chinese and I think I found it! The food was good, generous portions and the girls were super friendly when I got there. Reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"Just a warning to all.  We ordered take out from them on Monday night and all of us got food poisoning. My son had eaten there twice at noon.  No problems.  The health department needs to be warned, so I am warning each of you to please be careful.  Oh, for those of you who are thinking maybe all of us got the flu...no way!  I had just flown into Pittsburgh from out of state."}
{"text":"A good place for Chinese food, the service is good too. Also, the lunch special is a good bargain for a student. The manager is nice. The price (except lunch special) is a little higher than other places, but this is on Walnut St. so this is understandable. The suggestion is to provide more spicy foods (by \"spicy\" I mean really spicy:)."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the University area!!!! Everyone who works here is really nice, everything is fresh and tastes amazing! They give you a TON of food for the price you pay which is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"They used to be soooo good.... The last couple of times I been here What happened?? Prices are a little high but they used to compensate it with good fresh tasting general tso's... It always Saugy... Still ate it tho obviously... But probably will choose another place. They kinda lost me for now."}
{"text":"Wow what poor customer service. I was going to eat here once before, thank God I didn't because the place looked like a zoo inside. Very chaotic and the staff clearly had no idea how to manage reservations and walk-ins during a busy weekend dinner rush. A couple months later I called to place an order for lunch delivery and apparently they don't deliver. A Chinese restaurant - in Brampton - with no delivery? Seriously??? 

So making bad decisions as a business is their owner's problem, except when they hire rude and condensing staff to man the phones and their host table. He tried to save the order after I advised him the other three Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood all deliver - by asking me \"how much food do you want to order, we only deliver for over $70 and it comes from Mississauga\". So tons of cold Chinese food from a different city - yummy! I'm not sure the guy could even spell the words \"food poisoning\" lol.

Don't be fooled by the pretty website and modern look of this place, service is the same as most Brampton Chinese/Hakka restaurants - terrible. If thats how they man the host table and phones I can't imagine what eating there would be like. Actually I can, it would probably sbe exactly like all the other poor reviews I've read on here. If you're craving Chinese or Hakka in this part of town switch cuisine types because its all disappointing. Go to Markham or Toronto for great Chinese food, Brampton will only let you down."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh recently and stuck in a hotel because of car trouble. Yep, in town for a funeral and our car decided to break down. We arrived at the Chrysler dealership in a tow truck. We were considering what to do about dinner, then remembered an old favorite restaurant, China Palace.
Years ago, we made this a \"go to\" Chinese restaurant. We wondered if they would deliver, if the food was still as good as we remembered, and if we could make something out of this horrible day with a relaxing meal. 

I am happy to report that it was possible! We ordered soup, seafood stuffed eggplant, and spicy wontons. They were every bit as good as we remembered! We were able to relax after a trying day, and enjoyed the food. One tiny disappointment: they did not bring the wonton strips for our soup, and we didn't realize we had to ask for them. We also would have appreciated a bit of hot sauce to add( husband loves the heat).

Would we go there again? Resoundingly, yes, but hopefully under better circumstances, and on a day where we could actually GO to the restaurant."}
{"text":"China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes.  A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef (shui zhu nio) and Yu xiang Eggplant.  Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I've had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I've had at China Palace, I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.

Contrary to popular belief, China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner.

China Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.

Prices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.

Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is hard to find. Food is well made, priced right, and portion size was large. No real complaints. We ordered deliver which came super fast. Apparently the owners of China Palace also own Sushi Too which explains why my wife was able to order sushi over the phone even though it was not on their menu. Very Cool."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best service and amazing food for the best prices. It is cheaper than panda express but taste like pf changs! Seriously good. They have Chinese doughnuts filled with lotus cream!"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I ate dinner here and we shared the shrimp tempura roll and the spicy California roll and both were made perfectly and were delicious.  We also got the chicken egg fu yung and the Tender Blossoms Stir Fry.  I wasn't fond of the egg fu yung but I tend to like my food spicier, however my boyfriend said that he enjoyed it.  It's nice that they also have a full bar and they offer several decent wines by the glass, and their alcohol prices are very reasonable.

I probably go to China Palace in Sewickley about 6 times a year, and overall  I think that they do a really good job at offering a diverse menu filled with traditional Chinese offerings as well as the more standard \"Americanized\" offerings along with a nice selection of Thai food and a great/delicious offering of sushi/sashimi/rolls.  I've honestly never had a bad meal here - so for me, they have always been consistently good and the service continues to impress me - in fact the service has gotten even better in the last couple of years, and the remodeling has given the place a more modern, and expansive feel to it.  The only thing that I will say is that even when you ask for something to be spicy (like 10 out of 10) more likely than not you can expect the spiciness to only be about a 5 so be sure to ask for the hot pepper oil or for some hot sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I have been going with my co-workers to China Palace for a while now, so its about time to write a review!  The food in all honesty is alright.  It is pretty cheap and you pretty much get what you pay for.  What I do like about the place is the atmosphere.  It has a very family and homey environment.  China Palace has one of the friendliest staffs.

I would recommend getting the Mongolian Chicken.  You can also ask for white meat option, which makes it a little bit more healthier."}
{"text":"A good solid place for some take out, but it's even nice enough to dine in.  This restaurant has a few tables and booths  and I have never had an issue finding a table or getting quick service. Not really greasy Chinese food either. Last night my friend and I ordered the Curry Chicken and Chicken and Broccoli no complaints! The hot and sour soup was a great start and of course our food was ready in \"ten minutes\". If you're in the university area, this is your best bet for classic, quick and cheap Chinese dinning!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place
Prices are slightly higher than it says on here or on the menus website but the portions are HUGE 
So good and hot too 
I definitely have enough for us to have a second meal 
Friendly staff too"}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE fail. We had lunch there on Sunday and had heard good things about it. It has been in this location for a long time so we figured it had to be good. Wrong.

They used fake crab in their crab and corn soup which was basically hot water thickened with corn starch with some chicken fat from a melt capsule with egg white dropped in and a minute amount frozen corn and peas. This was a tasteless, unseasoned, unsalted -terrible. Zero stars.

Our entrees were only fair at best. My Kung Pao shrimp was peppery but had mostly celery with a few pieces of red pepper and some mushrooms with very few peanuts. Generous amount of tender shrimp. The sauce was oddly, overly sweet and it was the same for sauce on my husband's hot grilled shrimp, chicken and beef with veggies. My sauce had bottled hot sauce added to the brown sauce. 

Service was friendly. The restaurant was very clean.  This is why there are 2 stars instead of one.

We only went here cause Pamela's was jammed and had a long wait. This was 2x the cost and bad food.

In addition they had 3 beef dishes and 4 INTESTINE dishes listed under vegetables/tofu specials. Seriously."}
{"text":"This place is always empty and I don't understand how they're still open.

Anyway, I almost always get my order to go because they super fill the containers. One day I did opt to dine in. This was my first mistake.

The man who was serving my friends and I wasn't very helpful. Kind of grunted.

The food was decent. I would recommend this place for a quick takeout Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"For a quick, decent Chinese place in Shadyside, check out China Palace.  You get what you expect, it's fast and not too expensive.  I've only had delivery, but when I want Chinese food I've never had any surprises.

At the end of the day, you get what you pay for.  As for delivery in they area, it's decent enough."}
{"text":"I liked it.  Huge portions, not too expensive, and it's really nice inside.  I like my cheesy general tsos, what can I say.  It's not cuisine, but if you want a big fat plate of sweet and sour pork in a relaxed ambience it's great.

I'm psyched that they deliver."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Hakka, and decided to go to China Palace for lunch. I ordered the lunch special Manchurian chicken with gravy and add egg fried for extra $1.00 and lunch special price was $7.99plus taxes. It comes with a soup which was hot and sour, and it was really tasty with not to much oil. The spring roll was hot and crunchy, but the chicken was not good. 
First off I reported this to the waiter that the chicken was very mushy and looked under cooked as I saw traces of pink and the chicken was sliding off the fork when trying to cut it in half. He said that's normal because it's dark meat and not white meat. I explained to him that the chicken should t be that colour even if it is dark meat. I ate the rice, and left the chicken, as the last thing j want is food poisoning on the Christmas holidays. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"My wife ordered delivery from here on a whim. The food arrived very quickly. Piping hot. I like to try different things so I had ordered the beef lo mein, chicken fried rice, ribs, hunan wings. My wife had the General Tso's shrimp. Portion size was great. Taste was OUTSTANDING! Sadly I lost a few fingers trying to sample my wife's shimp (just kidding, with food as good as China Palace's in front of her, she wouldn't waste time biting my fingers). This review is very easy to write. EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. NOTE: I didn't taste the napkins, but I'm sure they would have been great too. This meal is up there in the top 3 of Chinese food I've ever had. I can't get more specific than that because it's been so long since I had really good Chinese food I don't remember the actual details of the previous meals. My wife and I both ate (over ate), and there's still enough left for another meal or two. I may end up adding China Palace to speed dial buttons. Then again, since it seems like we're going to be ordering from them quite a bit, the extra calorie burned while manually dialing might be a good idea."}
