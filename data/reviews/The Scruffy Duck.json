{"text":"I ordered the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and the ribs for my main entree, the ribs were cold in the middle and warm on the outside , which makes me believe they were microwaved... the mozzarella sticks were frozen and something I could purchase at the local grocery store and heat up myself ... very poor quality do not recommend"}
{"text":"I just had a hamburger here with fries and I can tell you it's the best hamburger I have had in a long time. I go to Burger Priest once and a while but this tasted way better than theirs. It's fresh everyday I am told. No frozen burgers here. The place has a nice rustic feel and they have a deck patio at the back that is quite nice with a quiet view of some trees. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I feel so sorry for the wait staff at this dump. The food is sub sub sub par, they don't have the proper training to make cocktails, the only people there are the regulars who crowd the bar area drinking domestic beer and talking about smells and sick while the rest of the place is empty. I walked in and had to sit alone in a 4 person booth cause the bar was taken up by the high I mean the low rollers.. I ordered a stake dinner and an Amaretto sour, after checking if they had Amaretto I got a glass of almost pure lemonade with no sugar on the rim.  By the time my food came I was biting on ice cubes and was bored out of my mind.  The dish looked like someone had taken a huge dump on my plate and garnished it with ONE SLICE OF TOMATOE.. weird weird stuff.. As I ate my coal stake I ordered a sidecar, the poor girl looked at me like I was from Mars, she said she didn't know how to make one but she will google it. What I got was a rocks glass of pure cognac which almost sent me in to a fit when I took a sip expecting a sweet taste to wash down the burnt coal I was eating, instead I got a mouth full of pure alcohol..  When I asked why my drink tastes like pure cognac the girl said \"we just had that same talk as we made it, its pure cognac\" Yet they still served it to me..  The owner of this place should be getting inspected every month for the next 12 months or be shut down asap.. This is the WORST pub I have EVER visited in my 35 years.. What a shame.."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night and my partner and I decided to go to this pub for some late night food. We were greeted at the bar and since I have been here before I knew there was a pool table and somewhere to sit upstairs we got a couple drinks and went there.   We were alone on the 2nd level and it was around 10:00PM at night. It was great to take my date here because we didn't really have to share the upstairs with anyone else. There was a pool table, darts, a chalkboard, a foosball, a table, a fireplace and a lounge area... Need I say more?   The waitress came upstairs and asked us for our order and came back with it in reasonably time (15 minutes or so) Though we were having a great time upstairs having fun, it really didn't seem too long. We got wings and nachos and we lounged around eating and drinking some wine and beer, and doing some of the activities.  There are places to sit at booths, at the bar or on high tables on the 1st level. The view from the bottom of the restaurant and the view from the top of the 2nd floor are great. There are multiple televisions for watching sports too as well as Karaoke on specific nights.   There are parts in the interior that seem to be part of a feed mill from back in the day which was interesting! It is a rustic and country feel. The food is good, though this is a place I believe that thrives on it's environment, atmosphere and entertainment.   A great place for a adventurous and casual date with your partner. Each day is different atmosphere whether it is Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It may be worth it to call ahead to see how busy it is.  Due to our good timing and since it wasn't busy, we had a good time and it was good food."}
{"text":"I had one of the best bowls of soup ever here! The place I was headed to pick up some lunch was closed for renos and there was a sign pointing next door. It turned out to be a very nice surprise. The service was really good and everyone in there seemed to be really enjoying the experience. I ordered take out and watched the food coming out of the kitchen. My mouth was watering as it looked and smelled wonderful. We were all happy with our take out order but I will be back to sit and eat some of that food I witnessed everyone else enjoying."}
