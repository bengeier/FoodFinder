{"text":"We went here based on a recommendation from Cleveland Magazine's feature on regional diners.  It's only a few miles from home, and it's got that classic, shiny, stainless steel look that epitomizes the American diner.

There was nothing wrong with this place, but there was nothing outstanding about it either.  Inside, it's so immaculate that you get the feeling that you're sitting down in a chain restaurant with a 50s diner theme.  If you've ever been to a Ruby's Diner, then you already know what the interior looks like in here.

I got a cheese omelet and my partner got sausage and biscuits.  Both were fine.  The service was fine.  The prices were fine.  Everything was fine.  But nothing was great."}
{"text":"My daughter and I sought out a new place as we do in our weekly adventures.  We really liked this place.  Totally a diner experience so set your expectations for that type of menu and service.  Our food was delicious, the service was personal and nice, and the experience was casual and un-rushed.  Did I mention the easy parking?  Gotta like a place like this."}
{"text":"I have been coming here a on a regular basis for several months and all the staff know me and know what I like to eat. The place is run by a lovely older couple. The food is standard diner food, nothing fancy, and that's why I like it. I also think that their breakfasts are reasonable priced, I spend about 12 bucks (including tip) on a complete breakfast. Better to be a regular here than a regular at IHOP or Denny's."}
{"text":"I really love the look of this Diner!!! From their red and white checkered tablecloths, to their cozy booths and the counter seating--near their open kitchen.This Diner's traditional theme is akin to sitting inside of a magnificent side car on a Silver Train! I had to ask myself: Am I sitting inside of a restaurant, or am I actually on a 1950s movie set?  
    
Additionally, I loved their  friendly staff and the reasonable prices of all the food items listed on their menu. Breakfast items include: pancakes, omelets, french toast, hash browns, eggs, bacon, sausage, and hash.

\"Comfort Food\" lunch items listed on their menu are: chili, homemade casseroles, hot open face sandwiches, homemade meatloaf, cod, roast sirloin, burgers, and \"Blue Plate Specials.\""}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for the Tri-C JazzFest and stopped by for an early-morning breakfast of scrabbled eggs with cheese, bacon, etc.  When my order came, I noticed that the eggs were runny; so I sent them back. The second effort was no better. The eggs were still runny. When I pointed this out to the waitress, one of the cooks began screaming at me from the kitchen: \"It's the cheese that makes them runny,\" and other ridiculous statements. He ended up telling me to \"go somewhere else,\" which I promptly did.

All in all, it was the worst and most bizarre experience I've ever had in a restaurant. I would never return and would urge any and all to stay away!"}
{"text":"Don't hesitate!

Seriously, don't.

I was in Cleveland for a one day in-and-out business trip. I drove up and down 55th street trying to find a spot for a quick lunch. I'd settle for a Subway, even. I was about to pull into a Wendy's when I noticed the Diner on 55th. 

This place was fantastic; a true pleasure and surprise. The menu is exactly what you'd expect from a diner-type establishment. Good, simple, delicious-sounding food including sandwiches, burgers, and \"blue plate\" specials (meatloaf, etc...). The diner was spotless; very clean, very well-maintained. The wait-staff was polite and attentive without being intrusive. 

While the neighborhood is a bit dodgy, but this diner is a real gem. If you're in the area, don't hesitate for a moment. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This food was horrible.  Store bought fish sticks just heated up.  Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Beautifully restored diner. But don't choose a diner from the decor. The fries were just frozen from a bag. cold. and no salt on them. Have you ever tried to get salt to stick to cold under-cooked fries? my co-worker got a fish sandwich that looked like it came from a tv dinner. Go somewhere else....anywhere."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Saturday and was very satisfied. Classic diner atmosphere, good food, great service for a fair price. My friend and I got coffee almost immediately and ordered breakfast plates. The coffee was a nice dark roast and the eggs, home fries, grits, and sausage were excellent. Pancakes and bacon were good. Between the charming atmosphere and filling food, I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"The interior layout is good and in typical diner fashion. You are greeted by warm, friendly, smiling faces and seated quickly, given a menu, the specials of the day, and your drink of choice within a few short minutes. Your appetizer(first course) arrives in 5-6 minutes and the main course, 10-13 minutes, respectively. The food quality and selection are very good and satisfying. The soups are personally prepared daily by the owner starting at 4:00a and a must order item. Get the bowl instead of the cup, you will enjoy it! The restaurant is conveniently placed on the north west corner of East 55th street and St. Clair avenue facing South. It is very accessible with abundant and free parking located in an older, lower middle class, industrial commercial urban blue collar working area. The exterior of the building is of polished stainless steel with beautiful mammoth sunflowers planted in gardens adjacent to the windows, a really nice touch. Inside and out, it is very clean and well maintained. The staff members are VERY friendly, attentive and quick. The clientele is a mix of local business and working classes. Safe and respectable with no worries.

The website: www.DinerOn55th.com is simple, well designed and easy to navigate with breakfast and lunch menus listed. To date, I have frequented this establishment approximately 15 times in the past 3 months and recommend them. SM."}
{"text":"Had soup and salad for lunch. Salad was very good the soup was okay.  The service was excellent; quick, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We had lunch there on a weekday in 8/05.  The diner is located just a few blocks south of I-90, with an exit right on 55th Street - so it makes for a perfect breakfast or lunch stop if you're driving on the Interstate.  It's a retro diner which opened in late 2001 and the interior is nice; the floor has black-and-white tiles, and the counter has the same with gleaming chrome.  The booths and stools are red.  Our server was very pleasant and the prices were reasonable.  (In addition to being closed on Sundays and holidays, they're also not open for dinner)."}
{"text":"It's good here.

This is homestyle, solid diner food.  No frills, no extras, and nothing fancy.

The price is great... 3 full meals for less than $20?  Yes please.  

I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy, the boy had an open faced meatloaf sandwich.  Our friend enjoyed her turkey club.  

If you are in the mood for \"easy\" food, quality service, and a true value - meander over to the diner!"}
{"text":"We're usually here for lunch which we always enjoy, but was in for breakfast today. Great \"crazy\" omelette"}
{"text":"Home style cooking,  served fast, at a reasonable price. I enjoyed the moussaka. My coworker had the half chicken. Both were clearly prepared on site.  The table next to us all ordered gyros that looked delicious, so I think that'll be my next selection."}
{"text":"I live quite literally 3 blocks away from this place and it's a great dive-y diner.  Cheap (really cheap....) food with solid breakfast fare, nothing fancy, mind you.  Open early, closed by 2 and the parking lot is usually packed with cars, also open on Sundays now!  You can't miss it, it's the gleaming chrome building on 55th."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a good diner for breakfast- but this was not anywhere close to an acceptable diner experience for me. 

First off, it was noon and I still wanted breakfast. On the website and the front door it clearly says that breakfast is served ALL DAY. When we were seated, the waitress immediately saw me looking at the breakfast menu and informed me they weren't serving breakfast. When I mentioned that it says all day she rudely pointed out that they only serve breakfast until 3 on weekends. If it said it anywhere, it must have been small or hidden that I didn't see it. So my friend and I, really hoping for breakfast, just ordered coffee and asked for a few minutes to look at the menu. She came back with coffee in under a minute which was great but immediately expected us to know what we wanted. My friend didn't end up ordering anything and from the once-over of the menu I had time for I couldn't find anything I could eat. I handed back the menu and told her I was a vegetarian so we had to stick with the coffees. Then she became snotty and told me I should have come earlier if I wanted breakfast. But like I said, I didn't know all day only meant until 11! I asked her if there was any way I could have something as simple as scrambled eggs and she told me the cooks were too busy for that, without even going back and asking.

So we're sitting there with our coffees when we realize there was no sugar on the table just artificial sweeteners and the creamer pods weren't restocked so there was only 3 and we had to split them. Since we were still hungry and only had two shitty coffees, we expected to get the bill quick. You'd think 2 coffees would take 10 mins max before we were handed the check, but our waitress didn't come back for almost 45 minutes leaving us bored, annoyed and hungry in a freezing diner. We even kept looking behind the counter trying to flag someone down but the waitresses all 'seemed' too busy.. The place was far from packed!

Finally when the waitress came back and got our checks she offered us coffee again.. Why would we want a second cup while getting the bill after 45ish minutes? So those are all the reasons I'm giving this place one star. Originally I thought to give it two because the outside and inside have a great diner look, but we didn't even get to enjoy it because of our experience."}
{"text":"This is the diner on 55th Street the trailer that sits there right on the corner of 55th and Saint Clair. Bad experience over there this morning I went in for breakfast, the scrambled eggs that came with my breakfast the cheese that was supposed to been cooked inside of my eggs was just a piece of American cheese laying on top of my scrambled eggs not even melted so when I went back in the waitress and I approached the manager which was sitting right there he told us that he didn't have time for this and to move away from him take the food and go. I explained to him sir I expected the cheese to be cooked with the eggs, he said I don't want my pans messed up and we have to wash them every time, so take the food or your money and leave my establishment. So I took my money and I left with a made up mind that I would not spend my money there again"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with the look and feel of a 50s diner.  The Lorraine Omelette is top notch."}
{"text":"Great place! Breakfast was so good and you feel like you are part of the neighborhood even when it's your first time!"}
{"text":"Our coffee was served with a side of anti-semitism. While waiting to order, the owner said to a waitress \"Am I a German Jew? Would I serve other peoples leftovers to the customers? Do I look like a Jew?\" When confronted, he claimed it was humor. We left."}
