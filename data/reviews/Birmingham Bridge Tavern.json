{"text":"This place is terrible. Fuck this bar, fuck the staff. This needs to be longer apparently, but honestly, I couldn't say anything more than that. The owner was a prick, the bartender ignored me for the first twenty minutes I was there, the place wasn't even close to busy and I would give a review on the food, but in that twenty minutes, the kitchen stopped taking orders. Nah, I hope this place gets shut down."}
{"text":"It's my go-to bar to watch a game near my apartment. Love the soft pretzels and honey mustard."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to the Pittsburgh area and it has been our experience that the Yelp Reviewers, in this area, have rated such restaurants such as \"Taco Bell\" with 4 stars. As a result we decided to disregard the reviews and base our judgement off the pictures..We have learned our lesson and will return to reading the reviews. Based off the photos and the little we read; we  were expecting to walk into a Tavern like place instead just a standard Bar. If you are looking for a place to grab drink this place is fine; good beers on Tap. However caution if you are going to eat there.

The food was not terrible and is your typical standard bar food. My boyfriend had a Ruben Sandwich and I had a Mushroom burger with Swiss cheese. The negatives of the food was it was really greasy and the chef over cooked my burger; I asked for it be medium rare and I received it well done. 

I did not complain about my burger being over cooked; as a matter of fact I was grateful. Had we read the reviews we would of seen that this place allows smoking. In the Northeast restaurants/bars do not permit smoking so that was surprising. It honestly was not a big deal until the Bartender/our server was smoking while she was working and then serving our food. Her hair was not pulled back and wearing flip flops. I have worked in restaurants since I was 13 and to be honest I was a bit grossed out. I'm not sure what the health code laws are but if any server presented themselves that way; we would have failed inspection."}
{"text":"Have been a loyal well tipping customer for months. After a discrepancy over two drinks - for which I had been double billed - the server asked if I would like to speak to a manager. I was delighted at the idea to fix this wrong, however the manager \"Jim\" tried to intimidate me. He thought I was trying to get one over on them when I have been a loyal customer for a VERY long time. I will NOT be returning ever again and will be telling my friends to steer clear of this place. SAVE YOUR TIME FOLKS. Not worth it for sub-par food. 

Sincerely,
Disappointed"}
{"text":"Hidden away from the over crowded heart of southside , went here for a afternoon lunch and it was awesome , great service was our first encounter and then the food was awesome, great Rueben Burger, awesome wings , fries ,philly steak and soup , what a great experience"}
{"text":"This is our go-to SouthSide bar. Wings are great, burgers are excellent. Service is incredible - Jim, Erin, Kelly, Josh... All amazing people! The 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and we've rented for parties too. We love the BBT! Always a great time!"}
{"text":"I'mNot the hip bar for dancing but if your looking for some good food and a good range of beer while you watch a sports game this is the place to go. The only problem is that it's not real big so it can take a little bit longer to get your food but it's worth the wait. Also there's smoking and the staff is really friendly"}
{"text":"This is my local bar.
Staff is fantastic.
Beer list is awesome.
Food is way above average for a bar.
They love the Pens, as they should.
5 stars."}
{"text":"The BBT is by far the best bar in the Southside!  A bit off the beaten path, but the selection of food, craft beers, and great wait staff make me want to stay and hang out for hours!!  Definitely the neighborhood bar to be at! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few bars that I'll order takeout from. The buffalo chicken wrap is sooo good, and it comes with fries so it basically makes 2 meals for me. I've only gotten drinks here a few times but always had good experiences."}
{"text":"This is a cool little bar hidden at the end of Southside. My girlfriend and I have stopped in multiple times for a few drinks and food. Never had anything to complain about!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood joint. Non-smoking!! And delicious fries. I wanted wings but less messy so I ordered the wrap with buffalo chicken - still messy, I should have ordered the salad. Hubs had wings and they were yummy!"}
{"text":"Nice wing selection and food/booze specials every day of the week. Large food menu.. many options. I like the option of ordering pirogies with any wing sauce.. refreshing idea. 

I liked the spicy parm wings. The beer selection
is pretty awesome.. so many IPA's.
Southern Tier Tangier 2x on tap!! 

Finding parking is a breeze too! 

Great service and cool atmosphere. I will be back.. thanks Birmingham Bridge Tavern!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that hot wings and beer are two of my favorite things in the world. So it should tell you something about the quality of this bar that I routinely make the 20 minute trek from Morningside to the South Side to go here. 

I have been eating wings all over this city since I moved here a few years ago and BBT is my #1 spot for wings without question. They are generously sized, cooked perfectly every time, and lathered in delicious hot sauce. They also come with a side of celery which I consider an essential part of the wing eating experience. The high quality of the entire menu is abundantly clear. Even my wife enjoys their bar food and she typically dislikes bar food. 

Their beer selection is great, but when I'm here I tend to stick to light beers to wash down all the glorious heat from the wings. The prices are fair and there is usually some kind of special going on. 

Lastly, the atmosphere in this place rocks. The bartenders are laid back and efficient. Make no mistake, most people are here to have fun, be a little loud, watch the game, and drink. But what you don't find is the typical groups of douchey young 20 somethings that infiltrate most South Side bars. 

BBT without question earns 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"So there is one bartender and one waitress on wing night and the bartender \"can't\" take wing orders...why? So you can imagine the ridiculousness of one waitress taking care of everyone because the bar tender is only capable of pouring coors lights.. The server wasn't even there til the exact start of wing night and they said they couldn't put it any orders ahead of time. When she did arrive she started at the front of the restaurant and took each table's order one by one and then put in all the orders AT ONCE. What sense does that make?? That first table had to wait at least 20 minutes before their order was even put in by time she got to the last table and then I'm sure that backs up the kitchen. She also made snide \"joking\" remarks about us being parked in \"her spot\" in the parking lot. Parking is for customers period and no one cares if it's \"your spot\". Finally when the wings came out they were overcooked and dry.. There are plenty of places to get wings in the area so there is no need to bother with this sad excuse of a bar!!"}
{"text":"Close your eyes and wish for a southside bar that's away from all the traffic, all the idiots and the mob at the bar 10 deep to get a drink. 

Add to that a large selection of craft beer, great food, memorable staff, and considerate and friendly patrons. 

When you open your eyes you'll be at the BBT. 

This has been my go to bar for over 10 years now. A perfect place to unwind. 

Daily specials and a killer Halloween party. Drop in if you want a great time sans all the south side BS"}
{"text":"Came here for wing night and wasn't disappointed. Lots of beers to choose from and a great place to go and watch sports. The French onion soup was delicious, and the Cajun fries are addicting. My buffalo garlic parm wings were 7/10 which is a GOOD rating (I'm a chicken wing snob) and at $0.65 a piece on Wednesday's they are hard to beat."}
{"text":"The greatest beer selection in South Side.  The best american style food as well.  Try the \"wing burger\", I go with the Craq burger, and believe me it is like crack.  I find myself lusting after it at strange times.  I would do anything to get one.  I want one right now.  
If you're not a red meat eater... their chicken wings are superb and they offer tons of different sauces and rubs.  You also have the option of getting a crispy or grilled chicken wrap with the wing sauce of your choice on it, for those who don't like the wing eating experience.
Definately worth checking out.  There are 3 floors here.  It's tucked away in the far end from Carson on a back street making parking a bit easier and definately a breath taking establishment and a great place to watch the sports games at! Let's go Pens!
Occasionally the owners will bring their GORGEOUS dogs in, that's always a wonderful treat!
You can still smoke in the bar area which is a nice thing, if you smoke."}
{"text":"This bar is like the Cheers bar with amazing bar food, sexy people, delicious frequently rotated beer, and tons of TV real estate. Oh and everybody knows my name there."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. One of my favorite lunch spots. The grilled chicken wrap is second to none!"}
{"text":"Terrific place to get a beer and wings. The bartenders are nice and call you by name after a couple times (which I love)  and the wings are to die for. They take forever because the kitchen is tiny but it is worth it. Get the Cajun spice or the Bourbon BBQ sauce wings and thank me later. Cajun fries and Hot Pretzels are also great here. Super easy to park around this bar as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh.  Fantastic food, great beer selection, nice friendly customers, and the bartender lady is pretty."}
{"text":"This bar is actually significantly closer to the other bridge and quit a walk from the Birmingham bridge.

They have a very nice beer list and solid food. The bartender was very helpful and found the perfect seat for me.

The bar has a nice atmosphere with a mix of young and old.

I would give it 5 stars but I dislike the name of the bar."}
{"text":"Great wings!  And on Sunday's you've got to try the pulled pork sandwich with the bourbon bbq sauce!  Delicious!  Truly a great tucked away hole in the wall from Carson Street!  It is now non-smoking too so I was able to take my daughter.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Bbt has become my all time favorite bar in Pittsburgh. It's awesome. It is located off Carson, which is awesome considering it's not in all of the hussle and bussle of south side. All of the bartenders are so friendly and they always have the best beers on tap. They have bottles as well. Their menu is amazing, they have traditional bar food and super unique items like a shrimp wrap. 
My favorite menu items are their fried pickles and their veggie wrap. I always add Thai hot sauce on my wrap and they have amazing ranch dressing (which probably sounds like a lame thing to review but my boyfriend and I are pretty particular about our ranch). Any of their wraps are great. The only thing I don't adore about this place is their French fries- they are bland in my opinion. Literally everything else that I have tried there I enjoy. Their French onion soup, salads, wings- delicious. Monday and Wednesday is their wing night. Favorite bar hands down."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice, and the food was ok. The owner came off as a real dick, though. He was apparently \"joking around\" when saying things about us ordering slow, or ignoring us when we needed to ask a question. It's also weird he named the place after the Birmingham bridge when it's near the hot metal bridge"}
{"text":"Why oh why have I waited so long to come here?!?! Though it's in the South Side this place is far enough out of the way that it escapes the normal douchery associated with East Carson Street. The inside is small with about 10-15 bar stools, 3 high tops and 2 regular tables. BBT has a great warm feeling with its tin ceilings, brick walls, low lights, and life long South Siders quietly getting drunk. They have a rotating tap list of about 20 craft beers, and usually have some sort of special starting around 8 pm, my favorite being Saturday's $2 Yuenglings till 8, then $3 Sierra Nevada's 8-11. You can affordabley get wasted all day! 

Everything I've eaten here has been awesome, burgers, fries, nachos, and wings. The wings are actually my favorite in the whole city, especially when they are sauced with their Golden Boy sauce (mixture of golden mustard and hot buffalo). They have $.50 wings on Monday's and Wednesdays from 7-10. My only gripe is that their food specials always start at 7, I work on the South Side so it would be nice to stop over right after work. Maybe I'll just have to start putting in longer hours. I bet that will make the cold beer and hot wings taste even better."}
{"text":"BBT is our regular after work spot. The bartenders are great, the food is good, and the atmosphere is perfect. If you're looking for a wild dance club, go to Carson Street. If your want a comfortable place to relax and drink a few beers go to BBT!"}
{"text":"Great spot hidden in the Southside! I had been there years ago and liked it and just returned for lunch. The downstairs has plenty of bar seating and several tables. Great beer selection and a full menu, with TVs at all angles so you can see the game no matter where you are sitting.

I had a chicken wrap with their thai chili sauce. It was tasty - next time I'll up the spice level and try another wing sauce on the wrap. Fries were done well and perfectly salted! Love that the place is nonsmoking and that they have bike parking outside.

Daily drink and lunch specials make a great option for people who want to grab dinner / drinks in the south side but want to stay away from the usual touristy spots."}
{"text":"Traveling for work,  found a wing night,  and you could eat off the floor.  Great service,  great beers,  great wings! And baseball on every tv,  with a jukebox maestro. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love this corner bar. They have specials (food and drink) every night of the week. The food is always good, and the service is always fast even when it's packed. There are plenty of TVs so if there's a game you want to watch, they'll do their best to make everyone happy. They keep everything very clean. Pretty sure it's always been a no smoking bar, so you don't have to worry about that stale smoke smell. The crowd they draw is very pleasant, making us feel welcome every time we come in. If it's too packed, remember there's an upstairs!"}
{"text":"A southside treasure. Their food is absolutely delicious. With their salads you get a piece of chicken with every fork full. Fully loaded with deliciousness. High quality service. Amazing draft options as well!!! If you're looking for a fun laid back place to dine, and have a couple beers this is the place to go. Exceptionally clean, and they have the nicest bathrooms out of any bar/restaurant on the southside. They have tons of tvs for viewing, and specials during the weekdays. Plus the staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"So I read the reviews and expected this place to be great. Needless to say did not reach my expectations at all. First off its a smoking environment and I went for dinner it just doesn't sit well with me. The service was slow and not too friendly. We ordered cheese sticks (cold, nothing special), beer battered pickles (way too greasy and pickles were to soggy) and the beer battered BBQ chicken sandwich (the beer batter was so over cooked it was almost black and I couldn't even eat it) we tried cutting up it and removing the batter but it was so much work for a sandwich we heard so many good things about. The garlic Parmesan fries was not in the slightest garlicy. All said and done my boyfriend didn't even touch his sandwich. It was a flop for us. The beer was good though."}
{"text":"Birmingham bridge beer battered bourbon barbecue bacon & cheddar chicken sandwich with a fried egg on top!

most amazing sandwich ever !"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall bar with some dining tables located a few streets off Carson St in the Southside. Nice beer selection. Started out with the loaded nachos, the chips they use were too salty but otherwise very good chili and toppings. We ordered some garlic parm fries after reading about them on Yelp, but they were kind of bland. The star of the show is the wings, other wise this is a 2.5-3 star review. 

We split 10 of the Eric Jr flavored wings as the menu says that is their award winning flavor. It was good, but a touch spicer than I like on a wing- I will get buffalo next time as Eric Jr is very peppery and had me chugging water. Regardless, the wing is as tender as you will find, and perfectly crisp. Definitely worthy of the hype."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and have gotten the same thing each time (the cheesesteak wrap). i plan on ordering other things from the menu, but a cheesesteak wrap was what i was craving both times! both times, it's been really good. and their fries are delicious, too!

one thing that wasn't so great: the second time i went, it happened to be wing night. my roommate and i didn't order wings, and it took almost an hour to get our food. it was a rediculous wait! the waitress appologized a few times, but told us that wing night gets really busy with a small kitchen. next time, i won't go on wing night."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed .. party of 4 for dinner sat down and not one of the 3 servers acknowledged us.  We finally walked out ... going to fatheads"}
{"text":"Cute little spot tucked away on Sarah street. Ordered take out from here over the weekend! 

Great burger and fries for a good price!! Not too greasy and great portion sizes. Friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"Great food
Loved the pulled pork sandwich and Cajun fries - Sunday special.

Staff and bar patrons friendly to new people"}
{"text":"As a business traveler that hates to eat at chains, this place reminds me of neighborhood bars near my home.  It allows limited smoking at the bar, but they ventilate really well, so no big deal.  Awesome wings, and I'm from Buffalo.  Always a stop when I'm In Pitt.  Go there, period!"}
{"text":"Very solid place. Everything about it is very nice. Above average bat food. Had a flavor of wings that was a mix of traditional buffalo sauce and something else. Even the bathrooms were decent for a bar."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries! Yummy wings! Great service!  Much quieter location than the joints on Carson Street."}
{"text":"We have become regulars at this tavern. Beer is good as well as the draft list. I've ventured out and tried things other than the wings. Our absolute favorite is their chicken tender wrap. You get to choose a wing sauce for the chicken. The wrap is large and comes with a side of fries and a pickle. 

After unfortunate experience at another restaurant, we decided to come here to celebrate our wedding and my husband's birthday. Sara was the bartender and server. She did an awesome job helping us and congratulating us on our marriage. 

We ordered the philly steak fries as an app. Wow! Absolutely delicious. Fresh cut fries with philly steak and delicious cheese. The cheese had a nice kick and spice to it, pairing it well with the fries and steak. Normally sautéed onions are on the fries but we opted out of them.

The tavern also had a taco night on Monday.  We decided to each get a taco. I was expecting basic tacos with a tiny bit of beef and cheese. Their $1 tacos on taco night are slow cooked pork or chicken, slaw and pico. Great for only $1.

For dinner, I went with the General Grant Chicken Salad. It had grilled chicken breast strips which had  Bourbon BBQ sauce on them. It was served on top of  mixed greens and also had tomato, cucumber, onions rings and bacon. The salad was delicious. I believe the General Grant is also a sandwich which has chicken, bourdon bbq sauce, onion ring and bacon.

Absolutely delicious meal. Not your typical birthday dinner / celebration of your wedding, but we were treated well and the food was great as always.

thankful to live 2 blocks away from this tavern!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to wing night here every week for half a year now. The wings are amazing. The staff are very accommodating and welcoming. Goldenboy sauce is everything the hype says it is. I don't know if I'm qualified to comment as if I've had every wing in New England, but I PROMISE you that you can't be disappointed on that. Good specials, good people, good vibes.

Bonus tip: get to the jukebox before you start hearing Hootie and the Blowfish and it's pretty much perfect."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We had dinner there tonight, their special included DuClaw beers but none of their beers are over priced and they have one of the better craft beer selections for south side. I had a Fat Heads Bumbleberry, which I've had before and absolutely love & my bf had a Bouncy House IPA. They had a lot of great summer beers on tap. Anyone can find a beer they'll like there! 
For food we had a BBQ chicken wrap w/ fries and a chicken sandwich. For the regular chicken sandwich you can pick any of their wing sauces/rubs to go on it. My bf is partial to their Jerk rub and he got that. The chicken sandwich is HUGE. And inch of chicken probably hangs off 2 sides of the bun. My wrap was awesome as well. The service is always good too, bartenders remember you even if you aren't in there TOO often and it's nice seeing a friendly face. It can get crowded on nights like Wednesday when they do wing night but their wings are totally worth it. 
It's fun to watch sports there as well, they do black & gold shots when Pittsburgh scores (jäger & goldschlager) which is always a good time. 
I highly recommend checking this place out, it's off the beaten path of Carson Street (one street back, on Sarah) but it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the place for a couple of years now. CONSISTENTLY excellent food, beer selection and friendly staff. The great specials don't hurt either. I've come with groups and I've sat at the bar by myself and I always leave happy. 

The Blackened Chicken Wrap is my go-to!"}
{"text":"They have unexpectedly great food. Not sure if things have gotten better since previous reviews but they won 2nd place for wings at a Pittsburgh wing fest so that says a lot. I've recently ordered a burger which came out great and a pulled pork sandwich with bourbon bbq which was really good. They have also recently made the bar a non-smoking establishment - Maybe as a result of all the complaints... I hate smoking bars too so I'm happy they made the change. Prices recently went up a bit but they're still very reasonable."}
{"text":"Bbt is the best spot to drink and eat in the south side. It doesn't have that annoying south side bar feel the food is great and the drink prices are spot on. Everyone that works there is nice oh and if you got the time stop in on Sunday and get jims pulled pork!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the burgh.   Monday night, about 10 people in the bar, mostly for wings.  
Good draft selection, about 20 taps.   We sat at the bar, and the bartender came in 3 minutes.  Wings came out in about 15 minutes, 5 perfectly crisp with dry jerk seasoning (9 out of 10) and 5 golden boy sauce (mustardy hot, 10!!!).  Wifes buffalo chicken wrap came five minutes later, (9), with very good house cut fries(10!!). I had 3 lagunitas and wife had an atwater blueberry.  35 bucks. It was wing night (.50$ wings) but for the price i was very satisfied.  When anyone asks where the best wings in the burgh are, now I know."}
{"text":"The first time I went to \"the other BBT\" (as opposed to the much more established Bloomfield Bridge Tavern) I liked it. They have a nice looking bar/restaurant. I ate a burger, which was pretty good. And, the bartender and owner did come over to us and chat it up a bit. The owner tooted his own horn about his wings (which I did not order). I love wings so i made a mental note to try it next time. All in all, a pleasant experience. In my mind, I decided that this could be a good after work/local bar, especially given the South Side location, even if it is a couple blocks from the real action.

I went back again this week, and I was sorely disappointed in my second experience. The bar is still nice - clean with a nice aura, not a dive. But, a few things went wrong: first, when we finally got to order, the bartender denied my request for wings because they were out. Okay, if you have signs that say \"Best Wings in Pittsburgh,\" you don't run out of wings! Second, they didn't adhere to the new no smoking law. It was like 8pm, not 1am; and there were a few tables of customers. If I had known, I would not have gone there because I just didn't plan on stinking when I left that night. 

So here it is, a 2-star rating. The food is not bad (still haven't tried the wings), but it's nowhere near great. If you have to go, order a burger or the veggie wrap - those are good. I really want to like this bar, but they're not giving me any good reason to like it that much. Everything is just okay, even though the bar itself is nicely kept. 

[The other] BBT, you'll have to give me a better reason to keep you around!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is lip smackin good!  This is by far my favorite place to get wings.  I enjoy the Jerk and have had a few of the others that are really tasty!  I would recommend going on a Wednesday b/c it's wing night and it gets comfortably crowded.  The beer is great too - they had this great pumpkin beer the last time I went.  I try to ask the server or bartender for recommendations and they are usually right on.  

Check out the BBT and eat some wings!"}
{"text":"The wings are delicious and the service is great! Everything I've ever eaten here is great from the burgers to the sandwiches. If you love wings, you'll love these along with the great beer selection. Of course, the staff is fantastic and always ready to help."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here on New Year's Eve and the owner has done nothing but make everyone in the entire room feel like home. The food is incredible, the beer list is incredible, the people are incredible. If you want to do 2018 right, start here!-"}
{"text":"Bar food is something that is often come by but very rarely done right. BBT is one of the few places that does basic bar food justice. I have eaten here so many times that the list of favorites are endless.The wings are done crispy and saucy every time. The General Grant burger causes me to salivate dreaming of its beauty. They also have garlic parmesan fries that are killer. Everything about this place makes my belly happy. The bartenders are super nice and take care of their regulars."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at this very cool local watering hole. Buffalo wings were very good, not the best I've ever had but above average. The Philly cheesesteak fries or an unbelievable decadent indulgence. Delicious french fries with steak peppers and onions smothered in cheese. What an indulgence. Nice atmosphere, it seemed filled with locals on Wednesday night watching the Penguins game. I'd love to go back and try the other items on the menu they all look delicious when I saw other patrons ordering them."}
{"text":"First things first, I love wings.

I love to make them at home, I love to order them out.  When they are great it makes my day.  When they are bad, I'm am sorely disappointed.

Their wings, as far as the chicken goes, is average to above average.  Good size, cooked pretty well.

The sauces however, are out of this world.

Here's what to do:
Go here on a Monday or Wednesday night around 6:45.  The wing special starts at 7.  Look over the menu at the wing sauces.  They serve them in groups of five for $0.50 each.  Each group of five can be a different sauce.  Try a few, and start with the ones"}
{"text":"Great overall spot. A staple of my beer league softball team after every W (which unfortunately isn't as often as I'd like)!

Some of the best wings in the city. Doesn't get quite the pub that Archie's, Cupka's, and Bigham get. But they don't need to advertise when they hold their own in sauce flavor and size of wing. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"hometown atmosphere!  Great menu!  Recommend the Jimmy D's burger if you like spicy!!"}
{"text":"I went here a few years back but I still remember it...cozy bar with a variety of beer selections. Bartenders and staff were friendly.. we owned the jukebox all night. 

it is a bit off from the beaten path but worth a visit if you're staying at the nearby hotel. This is a good pick if aren't in the mood for the far crazier bars down the strip on Carson."}
{"text":"I can't believe other reviewers went to the same place. I went for burger night, singles $2.50, doubles $4.25. Cheese and fries are extra. First, the burger was cooked cracker-crisp. I've never had a burger make me thirsty before. Secondly, they allow smoking, so the stench affects your sense of taste, too. Thirdly, instead of music on the speakers and sports on the tv, they were playing some super - annoying reality TV show, where the only thing you could really hear was that every other word was bleeped out. The bar stools were the most uncomfortable I've ever sat in, but they looked better than the chairs on the floor, which could not have been cheaper. 

The chairs are an exception, though. The rest of the place looks good, when you can see through the smoke. Exposed pipes, brick walls, and tin ceilings, it really is attractive. The bar, itself, is very nice, highly lacquered wood on a top that feels good under your elbows, and they keep it clean, which is nice. 

Also on the positive side, the waitress was good, effective, though not overly friendly. There is a pretty nice, varied selection of beers on tap, and the waitress had a printed beer menu that described each selection in detail. 

Maybe it deserves better than one star.  The smoke is a personal preference, but I didn't know you could smoke in any restaurant anymore. I just can't get past how terrible the burger was, though."}
{"text":"This was a really cool bar that we yelped the night before flying back to New York. It's a normal sports bar and our bartender Erin was really friendly. She didn't hesitate to explain the different beers that they had here. She even allowed my buddy to have a sample of one beer which he eventually ended up drinking the rest of the night. I had a blue moon and we ordered some wings which weren't bad at all. 

The only thing that I didn't like about this place (and maybe it's cause I'm from NYC and spoiled) but people were smoking cigarettes at the bar. I'm not used to that but I didn't let it bother me too much. We hung out and watched a college basketball game and chatted and really have a good time."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot. Good service, and good food. No complaints."}
{"text":"Stopped by  few weeks ago for the first time in years and I can say I wasn't disappointed. Spent a lot of time there in the past seeing bands perform upstairs. This last visit was also due to an event held upstairs; a fundraiser for refugees. The staff was so accommodating, the drinks were flowing and the food was as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"Walking in here, you expect the music to come to a stop and everyone turns around and stares at you.  You know, one of those dive bars that everybody knows your name, because you're a regular.  But for me, a stranger coming in, I thought it would be awkward.  I'm happy to report, it wasn't at all!

It almost seems like paradise!  A cozy little corner bar that has cheap food and a comfortable atmosphere.  We stopped in on a whim and it was a good decision.  It was 50 cent boneless wings and then at 8pm the beers went half off (Thursday night, just so you know:).  The news just kept getting better!  

The selection of beers on tap is awesome.  What's even better is that the bartender was super nice and kept getting us samples of beers she thought we'd like.  I'm a total wimp when it comes to ordering spicy food, so I opted for the non spicy side of the menu (it's cool they have the menu listing from mild to hot wings).  I chose the garlic parm and Golden BBQ (honey BBQ).  They were good, a bit small, but not surprising for boneless wings.  I really liked the BBQ sauce, it was sweet and tangy and mixed well with the ranch to dip.

The absolute only  thing I didn't like was that they allow smoking in here still.  I had just washed my hair that night too, ugh!  That smoke just sticks to you....yuck!

I have a feeling this could become my new \"spot.\"  Who knows, maybe I'll even become a regular...and not look disdainfully at the stranger walking through the door, because I'll know it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place hundreds of times and never stopped, until this week. It's your typical neighborhood bar, but with the nice addition of a varied menu with good choices. I think there is something for everyone.  I can't complain. Not the best I gave had, but not horrible. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Another great bar with the upstaris/downstairs thing going on. Upstairs we rocked out to a great deejay for a post-wedding bash.

Apparently Pittsburgh is all about the bottled beer - I have never seen so many bottles in fridges at bars before this. 

One warning - it was impossible to get cabs home from here, even on Saturday night, even with multiple people calling. Some of the boys went over to Carson and caught cabs, then brought them over to us. That was the only reason why we managed to get home!"}
{"text":"I've never had a better way to bring in New Years. We came, got a table at 11pm and have received nothing but great service since. The owner gave us champagne bottles (personalized) and an amazing buffet (FOR FREE).  What a thoughtful and awesome way to bring in 2018! So glad that I chose BBT."}
