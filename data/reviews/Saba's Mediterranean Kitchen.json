{"text":"I've revisited this place at least three more times for lunch and can confirm my initial impressions are not a fluke.  Excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you want to see succeed. We love it here! Good food, good people, definitely a great neighborhood place.  Yum."}
{"text":"For anyone who lives in the valley, Saba's is a name everyone is familiar with.  My husband introduced me to this mom and pop joint and I even make sure that any visitors that we have from out of state experience this restaurant.

The marvelous deal they have right now with their $5 gyro makes it extremely affordable.  For about another dollar you can add soup, salad, or fries.  I always opt for the house salad that is drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette which is rather enjoyable!  The gyro is one of the best I've ever tasted and The Chicago is even better, which has all crispy meat.  The adventurous side of myself tried Kibbeh, an appetizer that is made of ground beef, pinenuts, cinnamon and then fried.  The presentation reminded me of falafel, but the taste was very different.  Don't let yourself be scared by the cinnamon; it's subtle and remarkably delicious!  

Another all time favorite everyone needs to try is their flaming baklava.  The infamous \"fire\" show you get will impress any kid or grownup alike and eating it will be even more enjoyable.  Crispy, nutty, and honeylicious with a bit of an added zing from the burned off liquor.  Mmm, mmm, Mm.

I honestly cannot praise this place enough.  It's the right price at a great location with reliable service.  The staff is always friendly and will go out of their way to make sure all of your questions are answered.  Also, if you enjoy a beer with your meal, they have a wide range to choose from without the overly-priced sticker tag.  Who can beat that?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and the best Greek food in town. Try the tabbouleh salad, the lemon rice soup, the rolled hummus, or the sampler platters. 

The service is great and the owners are very nice. Every time I come, this place is busy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We started with no expectations. The decor is simple and unpretentious. Then my husband ordered the mint iced tea, I had a sip, and I knew we were in for some thing special. I ordered the chicken shwarma salad. Order the smaller size because the portion sizes are generous. It was so easy to eat healthy. 
The garlic fries were crispy and addicting. The beef shwarma in a pita kept my partner in crime wordless until he finished it. 
The service was great. Another table ordered a flaming dish and it was served with flare and OPA!
It's so hard to find a good Mediterranean restaurant these days. 
We have to come back. There's too much on the menu to try. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the valley, the gyro's are the best.  Service is great, even when they are out the door with customers."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food for a great price!!! If you are looking for an authentic Mediterranean place to eat, check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"First time and the food was amazing.  I had the Lamb Shank and it melted my mouth.  The hummus was perfect.  The service was tremendous and Jerad was outstanding.  He was very helpful with explaining the menu and made terrific suggestions."}
{"text":"Love this place, fantastic food, friendly staff.  We eat here at least once a week!  We are always extra supportive of local business over corporate and Sabas is great!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Their lamb is so good and I love their grilled veggies!! Their hummus is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Came across this place and decided to try it out. All I can say is \"Wow!\" The gyro sandwich was perfectly cooked and tasted crisp and tender. The sauce was my favorite part, and the fresh soft bread was amazing. I ordered some of the sides, namely the baba ghanoush and chipotle hummus. Both tasted like they were made in-house and the presentation was authentic, as if my grandmother made it herself. I would definitely recommend this place, and I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for dinner because we were stuck in that part of town with an Entertainment Guide and hunger pangs.  I was a little hesitant at first, because the restaurant is sandwiched in a row of restaurants that either are fast food or appear to be.  Anyways, I am glad that we did not turn away.  I had the falafel platter with grilled veggies and baba ganoush.  The griled veggies were very good as was the falafel (honestly, though I can't really tell a good falafel from a bad falafel unless it is total crap).  The baba ganoush was a little less smoky tasting than I have had at other places, but still good.  We also had the spicy feta fries (fries with feta, bleu cheese dressing and wing sauce), which were good, but would not hold up to the Gaelic Nachos at the BOP.  The waitstaff was very friendly and it was a good experience. I would go back, but I would get the sandwich for about half the price as the entree.  The flaming cheese also looked very good as well."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! Super friendly service and great food! Me and my husband both got the Chicago gyro and we love it! We also got the spicy feta fries. Sinful but worth it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service we will be back!

My wife and I popped in on a last minute date night.  They were very busy but found us a small table in back.  I was worried about slow service when we sat down due to how busy it was.  Service was surprisingly fast and very attentive. 

Food was authentic, service was very fast.  I cannot wait to go back.

Thank you,"}
{"text":"I am a falafel-holic. It's the strangest thing. That being said, we have lived just down the street from Saba's for 5 years now and it wasn't until maybe a month or so ago that we finally decided to try it out with some friends. It was ok. It's one of those places that if I'm out running errands with no time to cook and I don't want to get out of my yoga clothes to go to a resturant, I'll call ahead and pick up. And, we will probably take family and friends there for a casual lunch or dinner. The portions are large for the price and the staff is nice and friendly. I like a place where you can go and ask for suggestions and the staff has actually tried all the dishes. Again, I am a strictly falafel pita person myself and it is good by me! 

I do wish it was maybe open a little later. Sometimes this mama and daddy settle for late dinners due to the little one and there have been times when after 9 I just want to run across the street. But, oh well!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars :) Got their take out.  Ordered a couple sides of gyros and a starter platter.  Got the falafel, tabouleh, dolmades, spanakopita and baklava.  

Called in the order and it was complete and ready when I got there.  I really liked the dolmades and falafel.  The tzatziki was good too.  Didn't care at all for the spanakopita... the dough seemed bitter or something.  Just weird taste to it, the filling was better.  I wasn't crazy about the baklava either.  I usually like the filo pastry to be very flaky an crispy and this wasn't.

Not saying I wouldn't go back, just giving an honest opinion of my experience."}
{"text":"Great mediterranean food with excellent service! I had the Jerusalem salad with Chicken Shawarma and Feta and my fiance had the Chicago gyro pita with feta and fries. We both enjoyed our meals immensely!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time about a month ago and have developed quite the obsession.  after trying many a gyro( it's pronounced euro not guy-row ;) )and being in a mediocre haze from them all, I FINALLY met my match for pita cuisine. They were absolutely packed and now I see why. I honestly read through some of the negative reviews on here and thought..  \"are you high???\"  

So let me break it down.  The pita bread is delicious and moist as if it was made that morning. I got the chicken schwarma and the chicken was so moist and tender it fell apart. It was layered with some sort of special sauce and rightfully so it WAS special. It was deelish. My fiance got the beef gyro and for someone who doesn't like trying any ethnic foods (meaning anything thats main ingredients aren't meat and cheese)  he was in LOVE. it was awesome. He also ordered the bachlava (sp?) Which was out of this world. They don't use honey in the bachlava so it doesn't have that sticky effect makes for a much more melt in your mouth treat.  So excited to have this place right around the corner. Service was great, food was exceptional and it has a nice mom & pop feel. (Buy local my friends!). Highly recommend it! I Also saw they have a happy hour from 3-6 5.50 gyros and drink specials. The owners are so nice i never feel guilty about spending money on lunch here!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Great service, great prices. They serve generous portions, and very good gyros!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyro pitas, great price. If you're in Northeast Phoenix, you're just doing yourself a disservice by not trying this place out.

Just go get some, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't had a good gyro for years, and this place does a great job with them.  I particularly like that you have the option to choose between a the steamed gyro meat or the Chicago style seared gyro meat (which I don't like).  The feta here tastes fresher than anywhere else I've encountered.

The service is outstanding too.  I have never felt more welcomed in a Greek restaurant.  Everyone was extremely helpful and kind, and they took a personal interest in us from the moment we sat down.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, but this was our first visit to Saba's. I had the lamb shawarma and it was great. We also had the Greek fries, which are a cool twist on French fries. We now have a new favorite local restaurant. Shout out to our server Jared!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Saba's for years. I always get the same thing: Falafel Pita Sandwich and I always enjoy it! My boyfriend usually gets the Chicken Shawarma Pita Sandwich which is also quite tasty.

Today I added a cup of soup to my lunch. WOW, what an amazing surprise. The LEMON RICE SOUP IS DELICIOUS! I loved it!  :)  I will be back again soon for that soup. YUM!

Also looks like they're doing some remodeling to the interior, so I'll be curious to see how that turns out as the interior atmosphere is currently nothing special."}
{"text":"Terrible food and over priced. I'm happy to pay for just about any price for quality food but $10.51 for a chicken shawarma pita that contains mostly lettuce and yogurt sauce!  I give them minus one star....
Don't go here unless you want to overpay, leave hungry and have subpar food."}
{"text":"Excellant lamb shank that falls off the bone. I have also had their gyro and is spot on. I little small so you might have to wait on peak times."}
{"text":"Have been coming here with the family for 20 years.  Family owned and always delicious. I like their mint iced tea and fattouch salad. The sleepy gyro is always great too. My dad loves the falafel pita and my aunt comes all the way from Chicago to have their spicy feta fries.   Try it out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mediterranean option. Such a bummer that we never found this place before despite living a mile away. Very good customer service and food tastes great. Decent wine selection if you're in the mood for a fancier dinner."}
{"text":"Great place for excellent greek food . Love the sleepy gyro salad and the hummus . They give you a lot of food so come hungry .."}
{"text":"Yum!  This place had my family wanting to go back the very next night. Hubby and son had gyros and loved them. We had the spicy feta fries as an appetizer and...wow!  Dishes are authentic and fresh. Our server was fantastic and brought all of us a small piece of baklava after dinner. We only wish we lived closer so we could visit Saba's more often."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best falafel in PHX this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall type place but that is not a bad thing. Good hummus and pitas. Entrees are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  You won't find a better baba ghanoush in the valley!  You have to LOVE garlic to like the baba!  I'm just warning you, your significant other and/or friends must really LOVE you too, because it sticks around for awhile!  The must have is the Flaming Cheese!  What a show stopper!  It's soo cheesey, greasy and lemony! You must also get the lemon rice soup, so good!  Their gyro meat is meatier than most gyro's I've had and has a little bit different seasoning as well.  I recommend the Sleepy Gyro if you want a salad!  Just try this place out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Sabas. Great Mediterranean food in a hole in the wall atmosphere. Reasonable prices. The service was average, but the food quality really stood out. Hummus is fantastic. Also recommend the gyros, as the meat was well seasoned and tender."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had the privilege of eating at all types of restaurants including fine dinning restaurants around the country. We came upon this place just from looking at the sign.

The food is amazing, the staff is polite and professional. We enjoy the restaurant and could eat there every day. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal and dinning experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Small Greek salad is huge. Buffalo hummus and baba ganoish were tasty.  Baklava was good end. I will be back."}
{"text":"So, I know that some of the reviews for this place aren't great, but I had take out and it was pretty good.  First, it was lunch, not dinner.  I always have different expectations for a quick lunch take out than I do with dinner.  Let's begin with the location, yuck, sharing a parking lot with Walmart is tacky, but once you walk in it's kind of funky inside.  We talked to the owner for quite a while waiting for our take out.  She explained all about the Greek beers and the Greek wine.  We took the food home, I had the Chicken pita and my partner had the lamb with fries.  Both were good, but we're not pros on Greek food.  I've been to Greece, but it was a LONG time ago, and I don't remember the food all that much."}
{"text":"Very good service, friendly family owned.  Food is excellent and fixed fresh-you can tell. Go back for more!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had in a long time. Had the World Famous Gyro with Feta and Onion, so delicious. Small cozy restaurant with friendly staff. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick gyro to go, not bad but the cucumber sauce had overpowering garlic added, very bitter and bad taste left in my mouth for hours!

Girl at the register was stunningly beautiful, will return for another try!"}
{"text":"There are not enough nice things to say about Saba's. Food is always wonderful. Have never had to send anything back. The staff is nice and the service is prompt. I don't have time to eat in tonight so ordered carry out and still received same wonderful disposition on the phone as you get when you dine in. It is not a fancy place. They serve wine beer and alcohol and it's dark with a row of booths. They have wonderful dips and entrees in traditionally large portions for Mediterranean restaurants. So happy this is close to home. If you go order the dips apps and entree with the two sides can split with two people and both of you are full. My favorites are the pesto hummus and baba ganoush. First time to order the spicy fries and holy cow they are amazing!!! Hot and spicy and the buffalo flavor has you fooled that you are eating wings so good. It's a tiny place with big flavors! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Calamari and Mac n' cheese the best I have ever had! Our whole family absolutely loves eating here."}
{"text":"My son says \"world's best greek food!\" (Never mind that he had chicken nuggets and orange slices.) I enjoyed a good falafel sandwich.  Comfortable, non-chain place with good service.  Would definitely come back to try more from the big menu."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. I recommend this place for sure. Jacob was so welcoming. Everyone working there has a positive attitude and are so friendly. Not meant for large groups easy parking."}
{"text":"I always order the red lentil soup when it's available and I take some home for later. Love this restaurant! They have kid friendly meals and lots of options for everyone. I like the salads, and wraps. Very nice family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service... Never a bad meal here and always fresh. We have come to make this one of our steady goto regular places to go..."}
{"text":"Great famly owned gem/neighborhood joint that is a wonderful find!   I am sure some of the recipies for their tasty food belong to the family as well.  Sevice is solid, food is fantastic - I can't find better Hummus anywhere and you have to try something with their House Dressing!  Vegetarian very friendly.  I have been going to Saba's for years (since the mom and dad ran to now being carefully passed along to their kids - guessing post college age) and consistently have experienced great, fresh food and service.  Dont pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic Greek food with plenty of other options. George is great."}
{"text":"As an Israeli who lives in AZ for the last few years, it is hard to find any kind of good mediterranean restaurants who can provide some good comfort food!
Saba's not only has a great menu with delicious food it is also very affordable, and the ambient is friendly and welcoming. 
My wife and I visited the place for late lunch/ early dinner and were the only costumers, which made me worry at first, questioning the freshness of the dishes. To my great surprise all of our dishes were cooked right there in front of our eyes. There was no question to the freshness and quality of the dishes any more, as the result was finishing our plates really fast leaving no crumbs behind!
We were fortunate enough to be served by George, one of the family members and owners of the restaurant. George was very kind, open and talkative to us sharing the stories of his family and the restaurant. All of the staff were very friendly and genuine, and seems to actually enjoy working in here.
Great place we will definitely come back again when we are in the area of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is so overpriced. Their pita bread is from a bag that they simply reheat. Staff is unprofessional and rushed with the customers. I think people only go there bc of the lack of middle eastern cuisine in the PV area, they settle for this place. Hummus not that smooth or flavorful. Fattoush salad dressing they use is bad... The thing that gets me the most frustrated about this place is the portion size for their kebob entrees. I ordered a chicken and steak entrée both and there were three pieces cut of each for two entire entrées that they had packaged together for my to go order."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food ever!  I had the steak pita ($7.95) and both soups (red lentil and lemon rice).  I am seriously hooked.  The soups were amazing. The steak was really good quality.  I didn't expect that for the price and for being in a pita.  The hummus was awesome. The staff was friendly, too."}
{"text":"First time ever coming to Saba's, and it will not be my last! Located across from the Starbucks, this hole-in-the-wall place is a hidden gem.
 I came in with my girlfriend on her lunch break and we decided to dine in. We were served our beverages promptly, but not by our server. (For a small place like this, I kind of understand the delay) We ordered the chicken salad and the \"World Famous Gyro Pita.\" Everything was delicious!
 George was our server and he did not disappoint to answer any questions and make our long wait worth it. (Baklava as an apology? ACCEPTED!)
The Turkish coffee was really authentic and strong! Needless to say, it worked. The atmosphere is nice. Paintings on the walls of Mediterranean origin, music was nice too.
I had a fantastic experience and I will be coming back. OPA!"}
{"text":"I love Saba's! They have a great selection for vegetarians and the best tabouli I have ever had.  Their fatoush is great, also but be prepared to wreak for days.  The only thing I wish is that they would bring back their afternoon happy hour.  I loved going in there and ordering about 6 appetizers and sharing with friends. Maybe for the summer???"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times ate twice. Gyro pita was ok, lamb schwarma had almost no seasoning and last night there were 3 people at the register an no one bothered to acknowledge me let alone seat me, while the \"wait to be seated sign was up."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Just went there with my sister and everything was so full of flavor. Definitely a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with a few friends because we heard such good things about the food. We ordered fried calamari and spinach pie for appstizers. The calamari was great, loved their marinara sauce but the spinach pie was over done making the filo dough tough. Friends ordered the lamb shank dinner which they said was tasty. We ordered the origin and the Chicago style gyro which were okay but nothing to write home about. Dessert orderec was tarimisu and pistachio and walnut  baklava. None of which h were impressive.  Maybe the kitchen was having a bad night."}
{"text":"Got the gyro, a little peppery but overall very good. Food came out fast and with the sale on their original gyro the price was more than fair."}
{"text":"Forget pita jungle..this place has the BEST hummus ever!!!! I had a great experience the food was amazing and staff is absolutely wonderful!! Cheers!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best med. food hands down.  Great customer service, excellent food!  Dont forget to try the feta fries!"}
{"text":"One of my personal favourites!
The grilled veggie pita and the lemon rice soup are particularly good. 
(The vegetables aren't grilled all that well of late -  so do request for the vegetables to be grilled well,  should you like them that way)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10/5 stars I would - best Mediterranean food I've had, and that's from someone who is pretty picky and dines out a lot. Everything was fantastic - the local draft beer was delicious, the service was amazing, and the food was perfect - flavorful, fresh, light, and satisfying. We got the appetizer starter with chipotle hummus, baba gannouj, feta and olives, dolmas, and falafel, as well as a side of grilled veggies, sautéed onions and peppers, yellow rice, and a gyros sandwich with tabouli. We were lucky enough to save some room for the baklava, which was the best we've ever had. Elizabeth went far and beyond as a server, and super genuine, helpful, and sweet to be around. She made us feel like family :) the staff run this place flawlessly."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken Shawrma and the chicken was really cold  and it was a chicken strips and not a shawrma. 

The BaBa ghanoug looks like it came out of a can and not made fresh. The TABOULAH  was old and not fresh  and it looks like it was made two days ago.

The fries, you cant taste the potato as the only taste you get is the old oil that  was used to fry them. over all the food was really salty.

Over all its really over priced for what they are serving......You can add a couple of bucks and get a really quality food at a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous Greek lunch, which is no surprise, every time we dine here we are treated like a family member and fantastic food."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I actually ordered a Greek salad with chicken to go, and took it back to work to eat. The menu says it's, \"topped with homemade Greek dressing.\" I admit I'm not Greek, but Greek salad is my favorite kind of salad and this one was absolutely terrible. The dressing was made with WAY TOO MUCH Dijon mustard. I was like they literally slathered Dijon mustard on my salad. I could not eat it. I tried scrapping the dressing off of the chicken pieces and putting it on my pita, but the mustard was too much. The pic I posted is after I tried scrapping the mustard off."}
{"text":"A great place to get takeout. The restaurant itself is nothing much- not a ton of atmosphere. They do, however, have great gyros. Their \"world famous\" gyros are only $5 each. They always taste fresh and they are filling. I also recommend their spanikopita and baklava (the walnut one). Their appetizer hummuses are not worthwhile."}
{"text":"Carl was very nice, pleasent & good conversationalist. Oh & the food was delicious too, Timely, tasty & plenty of it for the well priced menu. And the ambiance is nice as well. We are definitely are coming back"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp, on a total whim - SO GOOD. I had the World Famous Gyros Pita, Emily had the Lemon Shrimp Pita, they were dee-liciius!!  Tender gyro meat, soft tasty pitas.  Mint tea was not too \"minty\" and refreshing.  Seriously one of the best meals we've had in Phoenix.  PLUS: Our server, Carl, was awesome - super friendly, made great recommendations and made the whole experience that much more special.  Will be hitting this up again ASAP!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mediterranean food - I had the chicken shawarma and steak kabob, both were delicious. The baba and hummus were some of the best I've had, and the portions were large. Eating the leftovers tonight. I'm always on the lookout for good shawarma, and this place more than met my expectations."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in Phoenix. 
Service is great. 
Food came quickly during my real quick lunch. 
Salad dressing was real authentic. 
Lamb was real chunks in pita bread. 
Real good quality lamb you could taste. Done right and served in a hot pita. 
Freshness you could smell and quite that will bring you back."}
{"text":"By far the best Greek restaurant I've been to. I was in town for business and they had been featured on the local news. I looked them up and the ratings/comments were spot on!! Amazing food!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, best gyro I have ever had. I got the Chicago style and the charbroil is where it's at. Food came out fast and it's very reasonable priced. My husband and I will be back."}
{"text":"I moved from Tempe to North Phoenix a month ago.  Aside from access to light rail the one thing I had been missing most was access to great Mediterranean food.  I'm always game for a good kebab or falafel sandwich.  A coworker mentioned Saba's and I was there just a few days later.

I stopped in after work and picked up dinner for me and the roommate.  The place was busy and almost filled to capacity.  Saba's is one of the places that lacks width but stretches back kind of far.  Looked a bit cramped but I can handle that style of seating for good food.  The waiters brought out plates of flaming dishes and yelled \"OPAH!\" each time.  Not sure if anyone working there was actually Greek but it makes for a good show and adds some to the atmosphere of the place.  My order for two was ready to go in about 5 minutes (not too fast or slow).  I was out the door and headed to home with the fantastic aroma of sheesh kebab sandwich filing my auto.

My roommate had the Rolled Baba sandwich, a veggie dish made with baba ghannouj.  She liked it a lot but I didn't try it so I'll take her word for it.

I had the lamb sheesh pita.  It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce.  Fantastic sandwich.

The menu has a fine selection sides, salads, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  They serve Greek beer and I think they have one from the Middle East as well.  One day, sooner than later, I'll venture back and dine in (even if it's a bit crowded) and take in the atmosphere and a great meal.

Saba's was very impressive all around.  It's on par with my two favorite locations in Tempe.  This place will be getting a lot of my eating out money.  If it wasn't for other favorite kebab locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Toronto that were a tad better I likely would have given Saba's a solid 5 stars.  It was that good.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a delightful place!!!  We just recently moved to this area of Phoenix.  I went there last weekend.  Everyone working there was so friendly and nice!  The chicken schwarma dinner was delicious too!!  
I enjoyed it so much that my boyfriend and I went back last night.  He was impressed too!  He had the Chicago Gyro and I had the Jerusalem salad with grilled gyro.  Oh my...so yummy.
And again, everyone was just delightful!!
Definitely have gained a couple of regulars!!"}
{"text":"My family & I walked away really impressed with everything from this restaurant. The quality of food was fantastic, the service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. Portions are great too. My family & I will be back without a doubt. This is a Phoenix gem."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!  The food is so fresh and the service is always super friendly & speedy!  I tried the Jerusalem, Falafel burger, and the falafel pita. All were so delicious!  Every time I go there I like to try different dishes since they're all so good.  They have so many vegetarian options and you can definitely eat healthy too.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Really great Greek food and a very friendly staff. Had the Baba Ganoush and Chicago Lamb Gyro. I've had a lot of gyros and this one is fresh, flavorful, and definitely gets my recommendation. I would also say that the menu is pretty diverse and would definitely be very accessible to families/kids/and other kinds of picky eaters. Very happy to find this place on our visit."}
{"text":"we've been returning to this restaurant since it first opened. it's a great place for lamb. over the years, we've had our favorite dishes. currently, we seem to be hooked on the chicken on the greens salad. Service has always been good, and the folks that stop to speak to you are the  family that owns the place, and they do that with customers that have frequented the restaurant for years. we take home meals so often that we have saba's on speed dial."}
{"text":"Saba's has great food! I am a frequent patron there and enjoy the food every visit. Thanks Saba's!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Such a nice, family owned restaurant. Everything we have had has been outstanding. The entire staff makes you feel at home and are so friendly. Since moving from out of state, this has become our favorite Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"Love this little place! Everyone is always so friendly. All the food looks good but I've only had the falafel burger, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Totally unassuming little spot. Doesn't look to impressive but the service and especially the food were amazing. The softest most delicious pita bread ever! I had the lemon shrimp pita and every bite was the perfect mesh of the ingredients. My boyfriend had the chipotle gyro and he said it was the most perfectly cooked gyro meat he has had! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So good!  That's all I can think of to say!  My husband had the lamb pita, I had the chicken shawarma pita, both were delicious.  The greek fries were amazing, as was the hummus!  The final touch was the flaming baklava!  OMG  I can't even describe how good it was!   The service was top-notch, our glasses were always filled.  I am so happy to find a local owned, authentic, delicious place to take the family to eat!  Go there now!!"}
{"text":"I'm just awful about their falafel, can't get enough. Try their greek salad- if you eat the whole thing and are still hungry you might want to get checked for a tapeworm! Their gyro meat is like butter! and all their hummus is good, but the buffalo and pesto flavors are my favorites. Even their grilled vegetables are genius! I saw on their website the owner & chef ate his own menu and lost 100 lbs- talked to one of the waiters there, he said he lost 40 lbs himself! Everything is always as fresh as if they went out back and pulled it out of the ground and tossed it in the pan. Their service can be slow, but when you take into account how everything is handmade not premade, it's so worth the wait! Too delicious to be this guilt free."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly and boy was it worth it!  Service was excellent and they even let us sample the baklava which was delicious!!!  Food serving size was ample and fairly priced.  I had the Chicago gyro and my wife had Greek salad, both were amazing.  They had a Mediterranean Mule we had which was awesome.  Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after my fiance picked me up from the airport since I had the usual exhaustion/hunger combo that, for some odd reason, always comes with traveling. It was a little late in the evening so I thought I was going to have to settle for fast food. However, Saba's was in the same plaza and it happened to still be open. When we went inside the place was empty and the hostess said that they were only taking to go orders at that time. It was disappointing for only a split second because we decided that it would be even better to veg out on our couch...thus satisfying both the hunger and exhaustion aspect.

We were pleased with the menu choices which took us a bit of time to decide. We both went with combo plates so we were able to taste a variety of gyros, shawarma, falafel, babaganoosh, hummus, rice and pita bread. Once we arrived home and plopped ourselves onto the couch with our very full and heavy to go boxes we dived in and proceeded to enjoy some damn good food. I had to stop myself from devouring the entire thing so that I could have leftovers for lunch the next day...which btw were just as delicious.

The fiance and I have decided that we are definitely going back whenever we have the craving and will probably take our friends/family there when they come visit."}
{"text":"Since I've moved to the valley almost 14 years ago this is still my favorite middle eastern spot. I'm from Michigan and have been spoiled with the best, this is only place that compares. It is only place these days I can find lamb grape leaves and they are so good. The flaming cheese is another fav. Everyone is so nice. Only problem is I don't live as close as I used to!!!"}
{"text":"Love their chipotle gyro lunch special and flaming cheese & hummus app. My sister & I love picking it up to go or eating outside with our babies."}
{"text":"Prettygood Gyro ! Meat is good \"chicago\" style but salad and hummus trio is basic. I\"ve had better Greek but good for quick fix and price!"}
{"text":"Sabas, A little gem in North Phoenix. We have eaten here on numerous occasions and have been consistently  impressed! The homemade food is spot on, recipes are family heirlooms. The service is swift and polite. Tonight we tried to eat at a new restaurant across the parking lot...after 25 minutes and a complaint, we still had NOTHING, not even waters. So we got up and came to Sabas! We left enjoying our meal, service and even have a little something for lunch tomorrow :) Try Sabas, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a hot minute, but damn was their food fantastic previously. Great little atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had Lunch combo with two meats.  Thinking you would get two meat portions but came out and basically you got one meat portion split into the two meats.  Basically 4-5 slivers of Gyro meat and two what looked like 1 ounce portions of Kuefta which were shaped like small hamburger patties.  Nothing was really bad, nut nothing was great either, especially for the prices.  Would be three stars if prices were a little cheaper."}
{"text":"This place is easily my FAVORITE spot to grab lunch or dinner. It's family owned, small, quick, and a good value. I have been going here several times a month for a few years. Being a vegetarian, they have endless great options. I love the lemon orzo soup and ALL of the gyros. I think I've actually had everything on the menu and it is all absolutely delicious. Can't get enough. Start your meal off with flaming cheese, warm goat cheese with pita bread."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best gyros in town! Their chicken pitas are to die for! Can't get enough of their tzatziki sauce! The rice is superb! The baba ghanoush is out of this world! Their hummus is exceptional! I'm honestly not a lamb guy, but I really enjoyed their lamb pita! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  We live in the area, and I started ordering take-out from this place.  I kept mentioning to my wife that we should go sit down and have dinner there some time, so we finally did and have been going back frequently ever since.  Their lemon rice soup (avgolemono) is really good.  We like the \"create an entree\" option, and I'm preferable to their gyros, chicken shawarma, and their shrimp kebab.  Their lemon shrimp pita is also really good.   We've brought quite a few out-of-town guests here, and they all thought it was great.  Generous sized entrees that are priced reasonably, Greek bottled beers available too.  Service has always been pleasant.  One of our \"go-to\" places for a good, reasonably priced local dinner.

Also...this was our 6 week old daughter's first outing to a restaurant and they were very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, we started with saganaki which is a delight seeing a flaming cheese \"OPA\"  although the size of saganaki is a bit small but otherwise is awesome. I got lamb shank with basmati rice and the parsley salad (I forgot the name of the dish) is very tasty and fall off the bone tenderly delicious. My husband got a world-class gyro pita and and red lentil soup which he swear tasted superb amongst all gyro that he ever had. We are coming back for more."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and can order it to go any day of the week. My favorite menu item is the lemon soup, and the falafel salad is equally as good."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Saba's almost since the day they opened. I've seen it go from a very quiet, hidden neighborhood gem to the bustling destination restaurant it is today

It's still an \"unfancy,\" strip mall, hole-in-the-wall location - the only difference is, a LOT more people know about it and love it, as much as I do!

I can't think of a single thing on their menu (and I've had most of it) that didn't leave me happy, satisfied and wanting to come back the next day

At least half the time, I've made a meal out of the combo appetizer plates, so I got a taste of many instead of just one. Each one of the many is better than the next. Spanikopita, dolmades, baba ghannouj, tabbouleh (I could live on tabbouleh!)...all wonderful! A more recent appetizer on the menu, are the spicy feta fries (french fries, hot buffalo wing sauce and melty feta) sounds \"unusual\" but is highly addictive. And, as odd as it may seem, I'd like to give a special shout out for their rice. There's something about the basmati/vermicelli that is deeply flavorful and I always want to bring extra home with me. In addition, I'll order the prawns for take out (so the sauce is on the side) and eat them plain...just so I can save the sauce to use on a second meal. If they made a soup out of the prawn sauce...I'd drink it!

My only \"complaint\" about Saba's is...I used to live in the neighborhood, and it was easy to be a regular patron; but I moved out to Fountain Hills three years ago, and it's no longer quite as convenient. I do wish you'd open a location closer to me!!!"}
{"text":"Very good and a lot of food for great prices! We go here regularly and always enjoy it.  The lemon rice soup is very good, and I get the three entrees with sides which is also very good the next day for leftovers.  I love the lamb shank, gyros, and falafel.  They also have great baba ganoosh (sp?) , hummus, and fries.  Service is also consistently good and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great people and great food! This was quick find and we were pleasantly surprised(: We tried a variety of food and each one had so much flavor. The dishes were all so unique grime each other but also complemented each other nicely, it was hard to choose a favorite. 
I wish they wouldn't use styrofoam to go boxes but everything else was great! (:"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere. This is a little place, but don't miss it. They have a pretty good selection to choose from. A lot of different takes on the gyro. They have saganaki too - don't see this many places. Highly recommend giving it s try!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mediterranean food at a good value. So far we've only done take out and it's been fresh and delicious. However, today I discovered that they offer loukomades for dessert which I absolutely LOVE. However, what they serve is deep fried pita, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar which couldn't be further from loukomades and I was so disappointed. I guess I should have read the description..."}
{"text":"We happened upon the restaurant on a trip to Scottsdale and decided to give it a try.  We found the food very tasty and freshly prepared.  The portions were of good size and a great value for the price.  I had the lamb pita.  The lamb was grilled medium rare as I requested.  The service was cheerful.  The folks around us were obviously repeat visitors who were welcomed back to the family restaurant.  For a casual Mediterranean meal this place is worth visiting."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. The only reason I am giving it three stars is because this is definitely not Greek food. Turkish or perhaps middle eastern."}
{"text":"If you like authentic middle eastern (Arabic or Greek food) avoid this place at all costs. We tried few dishes and everything came out fast like it was precooked and heated in micro wave: 

- Hummus was blah
- Baba ghanouj blah
- Kafta was hard and extremely dry
Chicken shawerma was dipped in garlic sauce that was gross 
Lamb shawerma was basically shredded lamb on a plate felt like someone just puked on it before serving
The fire cheese was more of a show and it got so hard afterwords we couldn't eat it. 

To top it all off the waiter was MIA and kept staring at me as I was ordering like I was speaking to him in a different language...

They are lucky to even get 1 star"}
{"text":"I had the falafel pita sandwich and greek fries.

The fries were nothing special. Just regular fries with a couple globs of feta and basil on top. The fries themselves were not coated in any sort of spices. Failed to meet my expectations based on the description in the menu.

The falafel pita was also quite unspecial. Just the basics (Lettuce, Tomato, Tahini). The falafel itself was better than most falafel I've had locally, but it was either overcooked or cooked in very dirty oil because the outside was black (No, not dark brown... Black), and it tasted slightly burnt.

The staff was friendly enough, but while I was waiting for my order, several of them  gathered near the front counter and had several personal conversations within earshot of me. Nothing they discussed was inappropriate, but the congregation of employees behaving so casually made what at first appeared to be a reasonably nice sit-down restaurant feel much more like a low-class diner.

I'll keep looking for better, but this is unfortunately the best falafel I've found in this neighborhood. :("}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Saba's for years. Their food is always fresh and its a family run business operated by people that care. I can't say enough great things about the family and the staff. Send all your friends and make sure to have the \"Flaming Cheese\" and Dolmadas :) nom nom"}
{"text":"Service good, we had hummas, gyros, spiced date crumble.... all real good... need to try the flamming cheese next time!...  messed up on a few tables bill.. including ours but got it fixed.  I liked it. . .  my guest was on the fence."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch. Looks like a great diversified menu with plenty to eat! It'll take several visits to try everything you want, but I'll base this review on just one.

We had the saganaki (Flaming feta) for an appetizer. While the taste of the dish was solely melted feta with a little oil, watching the guy light it on fire right besides your table was just awesome. 

I personally got the Chicago gyro with fries. The gyro meat was nice and crispy, while the flavors balanced quite nicely. The sauce falling off the pita actually made it more enjoyable, I'd say. The fries were also pretty crispy.

Good value lunch, and I would recommend if you're looking for a fix in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last few weeks and both times I walked away happy.
It's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall dive sort of place but don't let the old tables, chairs and dark interior influence you.  

The service is very good.  The servers seem to work together so if someone walks by they'll check on you and get you a refill or whatever. 

My first visit I had the \"world famous gyro\".  Although I've searched and searched I can't find where they got the \"world famous\" designation.  It's a good gyro. The pita is light and fluffy.  I'm not sure about \"world famous\" but it's pretty good.

I had a lamb Shawrama on my second visit with a side of balsmati rice.  Again, the pita was very good but I found the dish to be a bit on the bland side.  I'll stick to the gyro in the future.

This isn't the kind of place you'll want to bring a first date, impress your future in-laws or celebrate a major life event. But, for a good meal with great service at a good price - go for it!"}
{"text":"They do gyros (lamb) right! My go-to for gyros, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern food. You will NOT walk away hungry! The food is always well done, made with care, and served fresh. I am especially fond of their Chicago Gyro combo. Their \"side\" salad is really closer to a full sized salad & the dressing will knock your taste buds for a loop; mint, mustard, yum! Don't overlook their fries, which are basic, but cooked right (and the Greek fries rock). The Chicago Gyro is charbroiled, so adds an extra layer of taste. And that's what Saba's is about taste & flavor. I love the fact it's a family business and the staff is always personable, friendly, and knows when to hover & when not to. Bonus? They now stock San Tan brewery products, awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this restaurant right in our area a few years ago! Sabas never disappoints. The food is always fresh and the flavors are delicious! My husband and I enjoy the gyros or the two entree/2 sides. Their hummus is hands down the freshest and best I've ever had! It deserves to be ranked best Mediterranean food in Phx! It's family owned and the owners are very friendly. It's been newly remodeled and looks great."}
{"text":"This is a great little family restaurant. They were very accommodating to our special dietary needs. The food was wonderful and the ambience was great. Will definitely come back when I am in town."}
{"text":"My 2nd time there. As good as first time. Small little 15 table hole in the wall that serves great food. Good prices and filling portions. Highly recommend the steak kabob very tastey. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great service! Quick food! Great taste! Would for sure go back to this place. We hit them up for a late lunch and we were not disappointed. The gyro meat was awesome, tasty not greasy like some. Husband had the lamb gyro and Greek fries! So good! Kids meals were huge!"}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend to treat ourselves and we ordered some hummus and falafel to go. We had a chat with what I assumed was the owner or co owner while we were waiting. The guy was super nice to us and really easy to talk to. He made sure our order was right and made sure we had napkins and plastic utensils. Our food was made quickly and we were in and out. When we got home the food was fresh and our pita bread was still hot. Everything was delicious, definitely going to be coming back more often."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, and this small family-owned business is my absolute favorite. Their food is always fresh and flavorful. They have amazing tzatziki and hummus. They also give you a ton of food for what you pay for. Their pitas are the best around. I have never had a bad meal or bad service here. You can't go wrong at Sabas! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Moved to Phx 2006  was not happy about restaurants Until I found Saba's. Now any chance my wife can afford to eat out and fresh food. This is the Place and very friendly service. Has made living here better. Thank. You. George"}
{"text":"This was a top notch pita. It was the chicken sharmwa in which the chicken breast strips are cut thin and marinated in a lemon garlic sauce and then a tzatzhzki sauce is put inside the pita which contains a bunch of dill and more garlic and all tucked into a fresh pita with lettuce and tomatoes. For 75 more cents, you obviously need to get the feta and onions added and that takes this pita to a new level. It is a sit down place, but  at least at 2:30pm on a weekday service was quick and fast and friendly. Use the YELP check-in for 10 percent off and your out the door stuffed for 8 bucks. No need to get the combo in my opinion, but might be worth it to try the soup next time for a bit extra. This was a top five greek pita along with one I reviewed two weeks ago in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Superior food and great customer service. A friend turned me on to this restaurant. I have been addicted to their spicy feta fries and gotta get my fix every now and then.

It's at a prime spot with lots of shopping. Big Lots, Wal Mart, Frys Marketplace and Home Depot are just a few to mention. Eat wisely here, because Ritas Frozen Custard is in the same block. That is if you don't go for Saba's flaming baklava. That is a sight to behold and never gets old. Opa!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best  hole in the wall Mediterranean places in town.. if you're looking for a super causal small place to have a quick exotic bite, this is a great place. .Parking is plentiful and service is exceptionally fast...
 Their gyros are really good & the housemade dressing for the salad is nothing like I've tasted before. It's unique and so flavorful and tasty. Awesome feta fries and chicken salad too. .Everything I've tried is fresh tasting and super yummy. . All the cooks are Mediterranean so you know the food is authentic which is a definite plus and a must! My husband and I have been here at least 10 times and have never been disappointed..
I highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken Shwarma and hummus. Was good. Another time had a gyro. Very tasty.   Very busy restaurant. I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband, five year old and I had lunch here yesterday. It was my second time, I only come back to a Greek restaurant if they have good baba ganoush. The three of us finished off a large baba (even my daughter loved it). I usually order the Greek salad with gyro meat, Saba's has a nice zesty dressing different from other Greek places. Our sever happened to be the owner, George. He recommended the chipotle gyro, Chicago style, to my husband. I had a couple bites and it was amazing! I can't wait to go back so I can get one of my own. George also told us they have a buffalo style gyro, which sounds awesome. I've never heard of anything but classic style gyros, and I love a good gyro, so I'm excited to get these other yummy versions. My husband usually isn't a big Greek food fan, but George won him over with the Chipotle gyro-my hubby said it was the best he's ever had. We watched George interact with other customers and employees, he was very friendly, attentive, and helpful to everyone.  We had a great experience and will definitely be back for more yummy gyros and baba ganoush!"}
{"text":"Excellent find! Delicious food, great value, and super helpful friendly service. Worth the drive from the east valley."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars!!  

I've driven by this place half a million times.   It's tucked away in a shopping center/strip mall, so I always thought it was a take-out/fast food kinda place.  I was so wrong!

It's a small little place that has a great cozy Mediterranean feel.  The restaurant was pretty full and everyone seemed to be enjoying their experience there.

The service was very friendly and with my tomato allergy, our server was knowledgable about the ingredients and how the food was prepared.  He voiced that  he made extra special effort to assure my meal was prepared away from the normal prep stations.  

I had the Chicken Shawarma - a very generous size chicken breast prepared with lemon and garlic.  Delicious!   I had a side of rice and grilled veggies which were perfection!    My friend had their Lamb Shank which was a huge portion!  The lamb looked perfectly cooked and the tomato based sauce smelled amazing.  

There is a full bar for wine and cocktails. 

I really enjoyed our meal from start to finish and I will definitely go back again when in the mood for great Greek food!"}
{"text":"Drove by this little place and wasn't sure about going in.  The window to the street side makes it look like a nothing type place; however, we were going to MIM and decided to try it out.  So glad we didn't judge the book by it's cover!  By the way, they have done alot of remodeling, the owner told us.
But the main thing is the food.  It is GOOD!  I would totally recommend this place to friends.  The crew is friendly. The food is noteworthy.  We were just two and I had the green salad with shawarama (or however you spell it.  I only had the small salad because the server said it will be plenty.  If I were going to be in town tomorrow, I would have taken the rest home.  Chicken was delish, salad was really fresh and the dressing plus the tzatsiki was equally well prepared.  Hubby had the lamb plate with grape leaves(dolma, or however you spell it!) taboule, and gave it a total  thumbs up!  If we are in the neighborhood, and even if we aren't, we will return because we have been looking for a neighborhood Greek restaurant that was as good as this.
Easy parking right in front of the building."}
{"text":"Love love love the food here. Always consistent, and fresh. Chicken on the greens is my favourite salad of all time. And the Chicago gyro is fabulous also."}
{"text":"May well be the BEST falafel in town. Definitely the best I've ever had in the Phoenix metro. All homemade from dry, raw garbanzo and fava beans, family spice mix, etc. The spicy buffalo hummus is great as well!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Decent prices.  Reminds me of the little restaurants in NYC - long,  narrow space. Very cozy"}
{"text":"The portions were generous. Our waiter was great (guy from Massachusetts, sorry we didn't get his name), and the taste was awesome. I had the Sleepy Gyro Salad Chicago-style (grilled gyro meat) with buffalo sauce and she had the Lemon Shrimp Pita. I would recommend both. 

The baklava was also impressive!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have lunch!  I truly enjoyed the Chipolte Hummus.  The extra kick in the hummus is nice.  The Greek Salad with chicken is awesome!  It is a lot of food so come with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Oh, how much I love Saba's! I've been going here since high school, which was a long time ago, and it's consistently amazing. If you want Mediterranean food, don't think about going somewhere else go here!

I ordered quite a bit of food for my mother's birthday dinner. All of the food was to-go and tasted just as amazing as if we ate in the restaurant. 

Here is what we ordered: Sleepy Gyro Salad ( my favorite), the Fattoush Salad (vegetarian), Gyro Platter, Chicken Shwarramma Platter, Classic & Cilantro/ Jalapeño Hummus, Spanakopita, Pita Bread and Basmati Rice. Everything was absolutely delicious and we had enough variety to appease everyone. 

The service here is always friendly and is a great experience. I let them know it was my mom's birthday and they threw in a dessert for free, which was just so nice! 

While Sabas is far from my house, it's worth the drive for the level of service that is received and the fantastic food."}
{"text":"Ate here about an hour before the dinner crowd hit.  Ordered falafel and tabbouleh.  Both were delicious.  Plenty of food as it included two pitas and the falafel was served over hummus.  Hummus had a nice blend of garlic/lemon.  However, the star of the show was the tabbouleh.  Very large portion and seasoned perfectly.  Nice quaint, family place.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm a little embarrassed to say how often I pick up lunch during the week from Saba's. Quick service, combined with delicious food, combined with not feeling like I'm in a post-lunch coma after eating here lead me to be a frequent customer. Though, I might smell pretty garlicky for a while after... I get the two item dinner: vegetarian dolmas (prefer them to the meat), chicken shawarma, hummus, and rice. It's enough for two meals and makes me happy :) Not to mention, supporting a locally owned, single establishment restaurant is important to me."}
{"text":"Best gyros that we have had in Arizona!  Always get takeout, but have been in the restaurant, and the staff/owners are very nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for true Mediterranean cuisine, this is definitely not the place. It's not Middle Eastern either, this is a gyro joint. Every good review about this place has to do with gyros, which is American Cuisine. Otherwise, the reviews regarding falafel and rice, etc. are from people who've lived in Phoenix for too long and don't know any better.

I started by ordering the Saganaki, (fried cheese). I haven't had this in over 10 years, but I remember how much I loved it. The table-side presentation was quite nice, but the quality of the cheese was not. It was tough, not tender and juicy like it should be. I ate half of it and left the rest.

For the entree I ordered the chicken shish kabob. I was very hungry and this was quite good, but not memorable.

Dessert is where everything goes downhill. The baklava was good, not as moist and flavorful as it should have been. But the Turkish Coffee was a disaster. It wasn't Turkish Coffee: There was no sugar, no cardamom, the coffee was poor quality and so was the water. Turkish Coffee is supposed to be \"sweet and strong\" not weak, bitter and without flavor. Please remove it from your menu or invite me in to teach you how to make it. I've been making it for many years and look forward to it when I see it on a menu. Unfortunately, I am usually disappointed. 

The term \"leaves a bad taste in your mouth\" is exactly that. The last thing served in a restaurant is the most memorable. I would have given more than 2 stars if not for the coffee, but I came in mainly for the coffee!  Coffee is not expensive, learn how to do it properly."}
{"text":"So so good! Every single time! My world famous gryro never disappoints and their basmati rice is delicious  husband orders chicken skewers. Pretty generous portion. He always has a bit left for next day. Hummus is creamy fresh and well done.
months ago they had terrible phone people taking orders . George, family owners, came in, seems some training, supervision was done. That's different now. But food was always great. They accommodate as well.
Thanks for never letting us down on our to go dinners!!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-family owned and operated
-nice bar
-extensive menu
-fun, small environment
 
Cons:
-food was just ok
- I had gyros meat and hummus plate. Meat was kinda dry, and hummus was bland and runny
- buddy ordered chicken and rice meal. Big chunks of chicken, but he said it was very dry. He LOVED the yellow rice
- kinda pricey, and I usually don't question pric8ngm but this was up there. 
- this restaurant suffers from many others do...because the food isn't served on a hot plate you have about 2 minutes to eat your food until it literally goes cold. The one pita bread (really just one? At those prices?) lt came in a basket and at first grab was already getting hard and stale. They were also very thin.

But they were packed, and clearly they have a good following of customers, and good for them. However there are 2 other Greek restaurants that just melt me each time, and nnfortunately this one wont make it past the first visit."}
{"text":"I went to Sabas for dinner and the firs thing we noticed when we walked was the dirty old carpet.  The pictures on their website are very deceitful/false advertisement!  It's run down haven't been remodeled probably since the 80's it's a shit whole in the wall!  Their chicken Shawirma it's  disgusting, they didn't know how to make it.  Their version of Chicken shawirma is sliced peaces of chicken, which is not Chichen  Shawirma!!  Their taboulleh tasted like they made it a week ago!   And let's talk about their weightors, they looked like they haven't bathed in two weeks they looked like they just got out of bed!!  Their over priced for the quality of their food which is not worth it at all!!!   The first and the last time I'll never go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"Saba's is the first place I've ever seen to actually list \"Chicago gyro\" on their menu. I know there are a lot of Chicago transplants in Phoenix, but even this was a surprise. I didn't order it since I'm from Chicago, but it was cool to see.

Anyway, I swung by here one late night to pick up food for myself and a co-worker. It was handy to have them open a little later and with a pick-up counter right by the door. Service was good and I didn't have to wait long.

I got the buffalo gyro salad. So, excluding the buffalo sauce, it was a tasty salad. Piles of familiar but comforting gyro slices, and a good amount of veggies underneath. But yeah, that buffalo option...I don't get it. They basically just goop buffalo sauce over the whole thing, which just doesn't work with either the salad or gyro. Weird choice.

But even barring that, the food's good at a good price and I'd go there again if I was stuck at work til super late."}
{"text":"Their food is good but their service is so poor I'm never coming back.

Tonight was the last straw. I placed an order to pick - up, arrived to get my order and, after waiting 10 minutes and ringing up my order, they finally told me the food I ordered was unavailable. They did refund my money.

That's the third time that's happened to me in the past six months. It's the last time.

I used to eat here twice a week. A family runs this place. The old man is grumpy and distant, the daughter seems to go through the motions. The son is friendly, courteous and on top of his game...unfortunately, he can't be there all of the time and the rest of the staff doesn't know how to provide even mediocre service.

It's hard to give your money to people that just don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and they don't claim that it is Arabic food.  So when you try to write a bad review know wtf you saying.

The restaurant was amazing, the service was amazing, food was excellent and I am Arabic so I know what Arabic food tastes like. It might not be your mom's food but sure as f*ck is close to it. 

Oh yeah I forgot the chicken was not dry, and I had a full basket of pita bread plus they would give me more if I had asked.  If your too cheap and questioning the price keep your as* home."}
{"text":"Really!!!! Where do all these stars come from. We picked up and tried this place for the first time and I have to say how disappointed I am. Especially for the price I paid. I got steamed veggies and they are literally the frozen mixed veggies from Costco. I know this because I buy the bag all the time. The pita bread was hard and stale. I will be calling the manager. The only decent item was the hummus and the chicken was okay.
What a waste of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"First things first: Saba's does not have the best Mediterranean food in Phoenix. There are just some really awesome Lebanese places in Tempe and elsewhere around the valley, and as I discovered yesterday, we even have some excellent Moroccan food. But Saba's is very, very good. Possibly the best in the Paradise Valley-ish area.

Another thing: if you don't like Saba's because you've had better gyros, or you found your pita sandwich too lackluster, you are an idiot. Not because their sandwiches are good - I don't know if they are, because YOU DON'T GO TO A QUALITY MEDITERRANEAN PLACE TO GET A PITA SANDWICH. There, I said it.  The only places you judge solely based on pita sandwiches are places that primarily serve pita sandwiches.

No, at Saba's, it's the entrees that shine. The lamb kafta, the lamb shank, you know... actual entrees. Their baba gannouj is excellent; I get that every time.  To round out your sides, the grilled veggies are a great choice.

They also have fries with feta cheese and seasonings, but I didn't like those as much.

The mango juice is also a must.

So, to reiterate, Saba's is very, very good - so long as you don't get the same thing that you can get at every dime-a-dozen Mediterranean fast-food place on earth. The best? No, but it owns the neighborhood, as far as this genre is concerned."}
{"text":"We LOVE Saba's!!
I turned my husband on to the Lemon Shrimp pita with the lemon garlic sauce. We order it every time we go there. 
We moved to Phoenix over 16 years ago and the consistency of the service and food hasn't changed.
Have brought many friends there and no matter what is ordered the portions and quality of the food and service is always EXCELLENT!!!
You feel like you are at the home of a good friend."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going to Saba's since they first opened their doors in the 90s.  I love the lentil soup and salads, but I could eat their rice as a meal in itself.  Actually, I could go there just for the rice, but I'm not allowed to.  It's a wonderful go-to place for meeting friends for lunch--good service, reasonable prices, enormous portion sizes.  I'm not 100% thrilled with the falafel, but everything else is delicious."}
{"text":"Very good family owned restaurant for Mediterranean food. Try the falafel greek salad it's really tasty and good. The gyros are also excellent."}
{"text":"Love Sabas!  Great gyros, salads, baklava-we have been taking out and eating in for years. Everything on the menu is great. Quality is consistent and food is fresh and well seasoned. A family run restaurant that is a great find!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner and it was delicious.  We had the spicy feta fries for an app and whoever thought that up is a genius.  Never would have thought of combining greek fries with buffalo sauce and ranch.  My wife had the chicken swarma pita and I had the pita fresco -- both VERY very good.  The bruschetta in the pita fresco can make it a little soggy, but it didn't matter since I ate that damn thing so fast.  This is definitely our new favorite greek spot and even better since it's close by."}
{"text":"So I asked my daughter to go pickup Falafel and Greek Fries at Saba's. Never been to this place but looking at the reviews, it had to be good.  And when I had the Falafel and fries is so good. Loved the hummus and the feta cheese on the fries. Got to try this place...I am sure I will dine in the next time."}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  I love the falafel.  I love chicken on the greens.  I have never gotten a dish I didn't like here.  Soups, salads, and entrée something for everyone."}
{"text":"New delicious Mediterranean find for my husband and I! We started with a small hummus plate which is served with fresh pita. The pitas are served on fresh pita bread and the meat is juicy, tender, and delicious! The customer service is great as well! Nice friendly staff and prompt service. We will be back to try their baklava!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. I've had two bad experiences in the past and one of which happened today. I'm a busy person so I don't have time to dine in. I ordered to go. Specifically said I would like to order calamari to go. The person who answered my phone said small or large? I said large. I was told my order will be ready in 10 minutes. I have someone pick it up for me under my name and I get hummus with pita bread, which is not what I ordered. I call Sabas and they tell me there's no order for calamari anywhere. I reorder over the phone and come to the restaurant myself. They hand me a small box of calamari. I ask if they have a large dish, one of the guys says no, it's a one size. I was just asked over the phone if I wanted a small or large dish so this confused me. But I accept it and leave. 8$ for this small box of calamari was not an issue, it was the quality of that calamari once I started eating it. Looked soggy, and tasted like a rubber band. I have to work tonight and I'm praying that I don't get food poisoning. The first time I ordered gyros, I was not pleased. I can't recall if they ever messed up that order too, but I remember not getting enough of the gyro meat. The best places with gyros are Greek Pita and Chicago Gyros. This is not the place. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. I've been to many restaurants and I'm not pleased with this one. But I don't know what their dining experience is like since I've never had one, I just know don't order takeout from this place."}
{"text":"Saba's is just so good. This is a place we order from every month to two months and we always end up saying \"that was a good idea\" after stuffing our faces. I am pretty positive that we have explored most of the menu and have never been disappointed. I will always choose to support local businesses first and this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I picked up dinner from here last night.  Although the food was ready in the time promised and the people there are nice; I thought the food was just eh'.  My group of 4 ordered about $60 worth of food so we were able to try a bunch of different things.  Everything from the hummus to the gyro was just ok.

Would I go back to Saba's?  Yes.  Do I want to go back?  Not really."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Saba's for year and find their food delicious and very consistent. I also love the family atmosphere-all the employees are related. They are pleasant and friendly and I often see them on  the news,  making their great recipes! My family and extended family are all hooked on this wonderful food. However I have a question, I ordered take out several weeks ago and everything tasted different! The gyro meat was spiced differently, the tzatziki sauce tasted totally different then their norm and I didn't recognize any employees! Strange I thought-was the restaurant sold? Do they just have new recipes? The food was still tasty but not what I'm used to after frequenting the restaurant for 10 years! Also, when I picked  up my order it wasn't ready, evidently it was never submitted so I had to wait another 20 minutes! This would of never happened previously. Will somebody please tell me what's going on with the ownership of this establishment!"}
{"text":"I just love the Tiramisu here. I don't eat beef and after coming to know that the same oil is used for frying Falafel and beef has disappointed me. I wish restaurants had a separate frying option for vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Good food. Although unimpressed by the quantity. Pita was cold when served. Shrimps seemed a tad undercooked for my taste. Overall an average experience."}
{"text":"There are three things Saba's does undoubtedly right. Firstly, their gyros; they are great and some versions are very unique like their buffalo gyro! Next up would be their fries. They are cooked perfectly and are firm and crispy on the outside yet warm and mushy on the inside (I love my fries like that). Lastly, their lemon rice soup. Let me stress that everyone, unless they're either repulsed by or deathly allergic to lemons, needs to try a cup of this soup! I remember when I used to come here and it was only served on Thursdays and Fridays. Lately it has become so popular that Saba's serves it every day (That should say something). 

Everything else that I've tried at Saba's has been good but the three above mentioned items are great and my favorites. They are what keep me coming back and should really be considered for anyone visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite places, and I swear our last visit it was even better than it's ever been. Their meat is so tender, their sauces and dips so flavorful, the service is always friendly and it feels like the best (un)kept secret in Phoenix. I highly recommend the baba ganoush, sleepy gyro salad, and lemon shrimp gyro. Seriously some of the best food I've ever had. I've yet to find another Mediterranean restaurant in the Valley."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  I have been searching for an authentic Mediterranean place for a while now and have come up less than impressed.  Saba's totally changed that though!  Fantastic food, great customer service, the staff was so friendly and helpful.  They have items on the menu I haven't seen at other places that I've been craving!  It was a little hard to find for some of the people who were meeting us there but once there everyone was very pleased with the results!  Thank you Saba's for adding to my \"I will be back\" list!"}
{"text":"Oh so Good! 
The food is absolutely amazing. There are so many good things on the menu; it's hard to not over order.
The service was great. Quite possibly the best service we've had at a restaurant in a long time.
By far the best Greek food we've had in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go-to spots fo Mediterranean food. Super fresh, tasty and authentic with very large portions and great variety."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken food and service. Mediterranean yes nailed it coming from a foodie!"}
{"text":"We are hard to please and coming from Chicago with several great Gyros restaurants we visit we saw \"Chicago Gyros\" and said why not. Underwhelmed. The portion of meat was small and tziki sauce was very light and tasted much of wine vinegar. We may try other menu items as the place was fairly busy."}
{"text":"Before seeing a concert at the musical instrument museum not far from here, I picked up a falafel pita sandwich from here... let me tell you.  So good.  The falafel here has that perfect crackly exterior texture that I'm so picky about and just perfectly seasoned.  And they are super fast if you are in a rush and just picking up."}
{"text":"I knew that I was going to be in the area and I wanted a Gyros salad.  So hit went to Yelp to find me a spot.  I am so happy that I found this place.  I have to admit that this was probably one of the best Greek Salads that I have ever had.  Also it was huge and priced just right.  I will defiantly be back the next time I am in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great food! Glad to see a patio and the bar menu now has cocktails. The staff is fun and easy going. Love  the spicy shrimp gyro and the beat chipotle hummus."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual night out. The food is authentic and tasty! We've done a few trips to the Peloponnese area of Greece - Stoupa, Kalamata, Kardimilli and the salads and gyros here are just as good.  The meats are well seasoned and delicious. The pitas fresh and soft. Yummy tsatziki and hummus. And they have Mythos beer which is usually hard to find. Friendly service and good value."}
{"text":"Love the lamb shank and spicy feta fries! Best Mediterranean food in the area with friendly staff and reasonable prices :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Limited seating, but well worth it. Friendly staff, and family oriented. Has a family atmosphere, and the food is absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great service, great food!  Chicken schwarma and grilled Veges were delicious.  Plenty of food and yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"They are right down the street from my office which is great ...... but I have to limit my trips to once a week or I'd be as big as a house! Fantastic food and wonderful service. I've been here half a dozen times and have never been disappointed and I'm fussy about my Greek food. 
I'd highly recommend this great little neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Outstanding find!  We stumbled across this place by searching Yelp when we were out shopping.  Healthy fresh Mediterranean food.  The waiter was very accommodating, suggesting things we would like, the way we want them.  Lots of choices for vegans and vegetarians.  Had a grilled veggie pita which was wonderful.  They even have the choice of a vegan pita.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. The food is delicious. You have to try the spicy feta fries and the gyro meat- Chicago style! Jared has the best customer service. Everytime we go in, we hope he's working... he's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food. We had the Chipotle hummus and pita for appetizer. Hubby had Chicago gyro and I had Greek salad with gyro meat over it. All was fresh and really good. Small salad was enough for another meal. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was the best Mediterranean  food I have had in a really long time! My friend and I had the best waiter Jarod. The iced mint tea was so refreshing! Our waiter even gave us free dessert when we said it was our first time visiting the restaurant. Highly recommend both flavors of the Baklava."}
{"text":"I used to come here for gyros, but the spotty food and iffy service were deal breakers.  My buddy said \"You have to go now.  The son has totally turned the place around and the lamb shawarma is great.\"   I went Sat afternoon.  Lamb shawarma sold out.  Maybe it is good.  Hate it when they run out of food at 1pm.  

The food was okay, a little on the bland side, but nothing was wrong with it.  The prices are a bit high for what you get, but I guess that's the turnaround plan.  I'm pretty sure I know the whole story of the restaurant as someone (the son maybe) stood and talked to a table about how his costs are down, his staff now listens to him, and there are less items on the menu.  For over 30 mins.  Yeah great ambiance.  If you like the mom and pop everyone knows your name kind of place then you might like Saba's.  I would rather not have to listen to staff talk over my table but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Really good falafel, was a fan of everything except buffalo hummus but that was my risk to take. Good service, friendly and affordable. Enjoyed the dinning room set-up."}
{"text":"Lamb shawarma and calamari so delish, make you wanna slap yo' llama.. maybe even yo' momma too! =D jk But they are dammed tasty, though!"}
{"text":"OMG. Everything here is fantastic! Nice, quaint environment, friendly and helpful staff, and awesome food. A great place to have a quick dinner and a glass of wine. We love it!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here last night, and was clearly not the only one who thought of Saba's. The restaurant had quite a few patrons, some clearly regulars of the place.  I was hoping that this was a testament to the quality of the meal I was about to have.  Not exactly, unfortunately.

We shared the regular hummus which was chunkier and more garlicy than usual.  I'd give it just an okay.  I decided to have the chicken kabobs and chose rice and grilled vegetables as my two sides.  I liked the flexibility of the sides- there is a long list of them depending on what you're in the mood for.  My chicken kabob was also just okay.  The meat was a little bit gnarly for my taste and the seasoning was in no way overpowering like I wanted it to be.

The service was just okay, as well.  They were super busy, and after we got our meals, I was unable to grab our waitress to acquire some hot sauce.

Everyone in the restaurant but us seemed to order the flaming cheese, and they also have flaming baklava.  Saba's is clearly family owned which tells me I'll probably give it another chance and hope that my taste buds will dance a little bit more the next time."}
{"text":"Despite all the bad reviews we took a chance and went here anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. My wife and I shared the 3 combo platter, chicken kabob, shawarma and Lamb Kufta. I have to say it was pretty dang good. The baba and hummus were mediocre. I have had better for sure. The lamb could have been better quality but over all the food was good. Got a free baklava which was very good. I loved it. I would say one of the better ones i have tasted. I hate big flaky baklava, this was more like pastry dough, it was great. I would go here again. Service was pretty good too. No real complaints here."}
{"text":"My father just raves about this place so he brought me in for dinner. I had no expectations but by the time I left I loved every part of my experience. The staff was extremely nice and always checked up on us. We started with the traditional hummus and pita bread for an appetizer and for my meal I had the falafel pita and it was all fantastic! Being a vegetarian I was pleased to see how many vegetarian options they offered. The vibe of the restaurant was lovely and I will definitely be going back! 

Jared waited on us and he is an absolute gem! So sweet and so handsome! Everyone should try this cute restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. 

The falafel was not too oily or dry, and the humus was really fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The food was all good, but the hummus stole the show. It was so delicious and flavorful. The service was awesome. Very attentive. The atmosphere was nice too...clean, interesting things to look at."}
{"text":"Sabas Mediterranean is a great little restaurant for date night or family night. The staff is always friendly and can answer any question you might have. 

They also have a great $5 gyro happy hour! Which is an awesome deal because the gyros are very tasteful.  I also really like the falafel."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean resturant.  George and Liz run the family resturant with authentic family rescipes.  I have a couple of favorite dishes, Shawarma Chicken, Falafel (best ones in town) and Lemon Shrimp Pita  are my top 3 picks!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good
Food on the other hand was not what I was expecting for Arabic food
If your looking for authentic food this is NOT the place"}
{"text":"Went on a whim, we had smelled the food one evening but if was Good Friday... no meat. Went back..... Delish!!! Eggplant side dish is amazing, hummus was fantastic.... you must love garlic! Perfection. The meet was cooked to perfection juicy and tender. Dishes are big, you can share if you like. My son loves the Greek fries, the combo plates are perfect sampler of everything! The rice melts in your mouth. Kiddos to the chef, we watched her from our tabel. Dinner was busy, she made cooking look easy."}
{"text":"Perfection!!!! I'm a transplant from Pittsburgh, PA and was missing my favorite mom/pop Greek restaurant. Stumbled across Sabos and fell in love. I convinced my fiancé to try Mediterranean food and now he loves it too. Hands down the best scratch restaurant in the valley. The food is fresh well prepared and the prices are excellent. I have too many favorites to list. Just go eat there and You Will be hooked. Oh and try the date/nut bar for dessert. It's bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros I have found in AZ!  Always fast and friendly service! Love eating here!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food, super friendly service.  Chicago gyro is the best I've had in Phoenix, or Arizona for that matter.  Felt like back home at the Greek restaurants in Chicago.  Best all around waitress I've encountered in years.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a weekday. Service is nothing special, but the food is pretty good. 

The $5 Gyro special was a good value, mint iced tea was refreshing, and the lemon rice soup was AWESOME. I don't know how I had never had this soup before, but I am very excited to grab lunch there again sometime soon."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mediterranean cuisine in Arizona, period.  I had passed by this place several times on my way to Rubio's over the past 5-6 months and never gave it a second look.  After hearing someone mention it as a yummy place to get hummus and a gyro I decided to meet up with my family for dinner.  I am still thinking about the amazing meal I ate.
We showed up a bit early from what I had anticipated so the fiance and I decided to start with a couple of appetizers.  Flaming Cheese and Greek Fries.  The cheese was AMAZING and the fries were addictive.  Awesome spices and feta cheese.  Since we were waiting for the rest of the family to show up we struck up a conversation with George who told us a little bit about himself and the food.  He also brought a couple of samples of their soup.  Split lentil and lemon chicken rice.  Both were so flavorful and yummy!
Finally the family arrived and we ordered dinner, chipotle gyro and the Spanikopeta (sp?) with the lemon rice chicken soup poured over.  Absolutely delicious.  Ate everything despite already being so full.
Finally, we finished it off with Turkish Coffee and baklava, both pistachio and walnut.  Left feeling so very full and I cannot wait to return.  If you're in the area I cannot recommend this place enough.  You will have a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's a family run business where the food is always fresh, and the service is always on point. If you are looking for a casual Mediterranean place, this is the spot."}
{"text":"From appetizers to dessert, everything was absolutely delicious!! I had the Chicago Gyro and my husband had the lamb shank, both prepared to perfection. Our waiter, Jared, provided excellent service and great suggestions. Leave room for the spiced date paradise crumble!!"}
{"text":"We don't come here often, but when we want to splurge on fries with feta cheese, ranch and buffalo sauce... this is the place to go!
And we were in the mood for exactly that today.

Hubby had the regular gyro, I had the chipotle gyro. They both were good. Service was fast.

Note:
** We asked for extra tzatziki and we were charged 49 cents for it. It was a little too much dill for my taste but it was OK.
** We were coming from the movies, so we had had our huge drinks... I had an Entertainment Book coupon but it was pretty much useless, because it is for only 50% off a second entree, and you have to order 2 drinks... so it not much of a deal, you probably are better off skipping the coupon and the sodas (healthier and cheaper)
** However... we asked for water and... it tastes terrible. I think it has happened before. For the last year or so I am trying to drink more plain water and less sugary drinks/artificial sweeteners, so this is not the place for that : (

We also thought the gyros seemed smaller this time.

Last time I think I ordered a gyro salad and it was good and huge. I also remember baba ganoush has been very good here."}
{"text":"We decided to do something different and have a Gyro party instead of my typical taco party last weekend with 10 people total. I paid less ordering form Saba's than I would have if I made the taco meal myself! It was delicious!! We even had leftovers the next day. I ordered the gyro meat for 10 with hummus, yogurt dip and pitas! I made a salad with all of the fixing's and it worked out perfect. First time customer and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good place near the house to grab a salad or Greek food. Good prices and quick in and out."}
{"text":"It was \"ok\", not too Mediterranean , wasn't impressed with their food as much as their menu, ordered the gyro and my husband had the shawarma, definitely not even a comparison to the original/authentic  gyro and shawarma flavor texture that we are used to. Only reason we stopped by was because it was the closest and we were short on time . Their fries were good though. There's only 1 waitress that was handling all the tables, while she was great, but I don't think it's right to have 1 waitress serve about 10 tables during lunch hour... With the help of the cashier boy every now and then ."}
{"text":"Best! I love gyros and try them all over town,  and Saba's are the best. I have tried a few of the other menu items  (soup, hummus,  baklava) and they're all good here.  The family that runs the restaurant is nice,  and for what you get,  the prices are better than reasonable. LoL, it's across the street from my parents' home,  and my ex would always offer to take me to visit,  not because he was a nice guy, but  just so we could hit Saba's on the way back to Mesa. It's casual enough for t's and jeans,  but cozy and classy enough for a budget friendly date night.... Go here, you won't be sorry. You're going to be impressed."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Amazing food and service... I highly recommend  the lamb shank !! The servers are polite and will get you anything you need to make the experience of eating there great. My girlfriend and I love this place and will be back often ."}
{"text":"The food looked and tasted perfect! We loved the service too. Ambiance is cute and warm. I ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture haha"}
{"text":"Chicken on the green salad is sooooooo good! I have to be honest, I have yet to try something else since this salad is so freaking good! I am never disappointed with this item. They give plenty of chicken for this salad. I most definitely will be going to the restaurant to try other items. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Carlos is THE BOMB! 
He recommended the best food!
SUPURB service!
Delicious food!
Carlos is THE BOMB"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best felafel I've ever tasted. That being said, tonight I ordered Tabouleh along with hummus and gyro meat. 10/10. Solid quality. No wonder they've been in business for 21 years! You can't be in business that long if you're not being consistent. I love the fact that's it's a family business and not some huge fast food chain trying to make nothing but profit by lowering the quality over price. Would definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their bruschetta is by far my favorite of any place I've ever tried it at. Their lemon rice soup is just as good, and the atmosphere is so cozy and cute, at least at this location."}
{"text":"Yum. In the North Phoenix area, there are about two Middle Eastern restaurants, one of which is Pita Jungle, but I've never been a fan. I drive by Saba's all the time and finally had the opportunity to stop by. I was pleasantly surprised.

The lemon-rice soup was divine, and they offer a truly vegetarian option as well. There are also numerous vegetarian choices on the menu. We started with saganaki, which was passable, and my main dish was a pita with tabouleh, hummus, feta, and pepperoncini. I'd never thought of putting that in a pita, but it was a great choice!

Service was quick other than that I had to ask for a water refill. The prices were fantastic. I will definitely be heading back to try all of the other veggie choices, and this will be my first choice in Mediterranean fare in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for over 15 year.  We used to love this place, but it seems the quality has gone down considerably and prices have gone up.  Tonight my husband had the gyros sandwich and I had the Sleepy Salad.  They gyros meat was inedible, it tasted so processed that we ended up discarding of the sandwich and salad.

I don't know what happened to this place!  We will not be coming back.

They need to go back to the quality they once had.  The gyros meat used to taste fresh.  

So disappointing."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch . Very quick and tasty . Consistent and great value. I bring out of town guests here and they always enjoy. Great menu for those who like ethnic food and many options for those who don't ."}
{"text":"3 stars... I really wanted to give more stars, but the food was just ok and the strip mall location doesn't add anything to the experience either.  

I went to dinner here the other night with my boyfriend on HIS SUGGESTION.  Since I had never been before, I was up for the new adventure.  I like that it is just a casual little place and the pictures of Greece on the walls had me thinking it may impress me.  Unfortunately, not the case.

I will say that our waitress, Anna, was really sweet and knowledgeable.  You could tell she's been working there for years.  We started with the red lentil soup which was delicious and Anna brought us a taste of the spinach curry soup as well - it was spicy but tasty and had me excited for what was to come.

We went with the Sleepy Gyro Salad and the 'Vegetarian Plate II\" which was more than enough food for us to share.  Too bad none of it was that great.  The vegetarian plate came with hummus, baba, falafel, dolmas, tabbouleh, spanikopita and yogurt sauce for $12.45.  Not such a deal.  The hummus is better at Pita Jungle, the baba ghannouj was ok but really smokey, the falafel just eh, the dolmas and tabbouleh both mediocre, and the spanikopita was dry instead of moist and flaky...

The 'sleepy gyro' salad is filled with too many onions and has a ridiculous amount of garlic... If you like onions, garlic, and gyro though, this is a good deal at $8.55!

Sorry, Saba's - even though Anna was a great waitress, I will not be coming back to visit you anytime soon... instead, I'll be on the hunt for Greek / Middle Eastern Cuisine that compares to that I grew up with in Detroit!"}
{"text":"Great little Mediterranean Restaurant. All the meals are delicious and filling, They have a full menu of gyros, and other Greek specialties. It's a small place but the meals are worth the wait if necessary,"}
{"text":"I was looking through Yelp and noticed Saba's site. My husband and I have eaten here on many, many occasions and have never ever been disappointed with any of our meals here. The servers are always cordial and service-oriented. Saba's gets our vote for a go to Mediterranean restaurant! Making me hungry for a falafel sandwich just writing this review! Yum ;) Try it for yourself, I know you will not be disappointed! Their menu has something on it for everyone, whether you are vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free or non-committed, you will find something on it to order. You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This is such an amazing gem! My husband and I have been going here for close to 10 years. It's family owned and operated and the care and attention to detail is definitely there! I can't say one bad thing about anything on the menu. We've tried nearly everything and it's all delicious!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I am very familiar with and fond of great Greek/Mediterranean restaurants. There are a multiplicity of them in Greek town and there is Cedars Mediterranean Kitchen in Hyde Park. I am also very familiar with a variety of neighborhood, fast-food gyros joints.

Now in Phoenix, I decided to visit Saba's. My opinion of it depends on the basis of comparison. Compared to the fast-food gyros joints, it's one of the best. Compared to real Greek restaurants it's one of the worst.

I had the Lamb Shewerma. The pita, sauce, lettuce and tomatoes per fresh ad tasty. However, the lamb, which should have been the star of the show, was under-seasoned. The fries were crisp, hot and delicious. (But this I can get at many fast-food joints.) Of everything I ate, I enjoyed the pistachio baklava the most."}
{"text":"I LOVE this family owned restaurant. I have been coming here for 13 years and this restaurant only gets better as the years go by. A lovely atmosphere with great food and amazing service. A definite MUST when visiting this area."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best hummus, best falafel and best soups! Great staff, too."}
{"text":"They are so good! Mediterranean home cooking at its finest. We love this place! I discovered Sabas back in 2007. Just recently started ordering from them again. They are a bit of a drive from us. So, the hummus is flavorful. Some places it's just bland. Not here. Very Tasty. My husband is a big fan of the gyros. I always end up getting a bite or two, or three...or... I digress... I am a big fan of their kuefta kebab platter. The baba ghannouj and tabbouleh are amazing. Check them out if your in the mood for some amazing Mediterranean home cooking!"}
{"text":"Urban Spoon App pick. Decided to try for lunch after Alice in Wonderland. We of course tried the \"infamous\" flaming cheese and it did not disappoint, in presentation or in taste. Their pitas are fantastic..not thin and dry like the grocery stores. They were fluffy and doughy as they should be. Followed it up with the Gyro and it was plenty filling on its own without any sides added. I noticed below that someone was complaining about the amount received in the sides and from the picture, that side was one serving. We wonder why we're so fat in America.. it's because pretty much everywhere you go, you are given 2 to 3 servings presented as a single serving and we eat it as if it's one. I applaud and appreciate them for actually giving 1 serving because either you're overeating and will be fork lifted off your couch one day or you'll eat the one serving and throw the rest of it way and waste it. Plus the sides are less than $2 , order another one??If you're pinching your pennies that tightly you should probably be staying home and eating ramen."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the sleepy gyro salad and the Jerusalem salad with chicken shawarma. 

Both salads came with pita bread and tziki sauce. 

The Jerusalem salad was very tasty and filling. 
The gyro salad was just okay. It needed some sort of dressing (we got some Greek)....but even with the dressing it wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had. 

I think the salads were a bit overpriced.....we paid 25 dollars for the 2 salads (not including tip) and no drinks. 

If I was in the area I might stop back for the Jerusalem salad but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Outstanding Middle East food!! Service is great and the three entree special is authentic and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Sabas has been around forever,  and the quality has always been consistently good.  Their $5 gyro pita deal is insane for the great gyro you get.  The tzazilki (I know I spelled that wrong) is delicious.  

Try the lamb too, its veey good. The owners and staff are always very nice.  Good local spot."}
{"text":"We really, really wanted to like this more and PLEASE someone correct me if I'm wrong. The food just tasted a little off. 

My partner and I have eaten a lot of Greek food, we love it. When we lived in Chicago, Greektown was one of our favorite places to have dinner. So, why does the food at Saba's taste so...different?

The Avgolemeno Soup was good as was the service. We just weren't jumping for joy over the food. I had the Chicken Sultani and my partner had the Chicken Gyros Platter. Both were just okay and it really came down to the seasonings they used. They just seemed to be too pungent or aromatic.

We might try Saba's again, but for something more mainstream like Gyros."}
{"text":"So I'm a pretty big fan of Mediterranean food and have tried quite a few places throughout the Valley.

The food here was maybe slightly above average in comparison to the other places.  We ordered the chicken shawarma, lamb Kuefta, Tabbouleh salad, hummus and lentil soup.  Everything was really good with the exception of the Kuefta which was pretty dry and unimpressive.  The meal includes 1 small piece of pita bread, which isn't enough, nor was it very good. They charge extra for an additional piece. They only include 1 small container of sauce, Tzatsiki or Tahini, and they charge extra for an additional container.  Not a big fan of their nickel and diming.

Overall the food and service was good, but there are much better values out there."}
{"text":"Great great lunch stop. The chicken shawarma was just amazing with a cup of red lentil soup."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. 
Service sub par. (At least today at 1pm it was...). I felt like I deserved a tip at the end.

During the many times I came in to either ask for something, get the bill and drop it back off, there was no obvious manager around, or I definately would have said something."}
{"text":"Great Arabic food! I lived in Dubai my entire life before moving to the USA and was looking for an authentic Arabic restaurant. Saba's Mediterranean Kitchen hits home run with its flavours! Very authentic food. Mine was a to-go order that I placed via phone. It was ready in 15mins, as promised. We ordered the traditional hummus, tzatziki, falafel, fries and bread.

Also, I got a 10% discount for checking in on Yelp! Portion sizes are good. 

I'll be going back soon for a dine-in experience. :)"}
{"text":"I tried around two dozen other places around the valley for Mediterranean food and not one of them came close to being as fantastic as Saba's. 

A valley-local owned and operated spot for many years, the current owner George has personally greeted me on many occasions, and that is the not the least reason why I always come back. Fantastic bottled beer from several unique locations, amazing hummus combos for appetizers, and a gyro which truly deserves the name \"World Famous.\"

Others have commented on how good the entrees are and I don't disagree. Everything is prepared carefully and served simply, this place is easy on the wallet and easy on the pants size due to healthy fresh ingredients.

For starters, you cannot miss the Flaming Saganaki. With a traditional flair for showmanship, you'll hear either George the owner or one of his fantastic servers shout \"OPA!\" before setting fire to your appetizer. Dinner and a show!

As mentioned, I have tried many other places searching for the \"Perfect\" gyro. While I don't truly believe that something can be 100% perfect, the World Famous from Saba's comes close. Piled up with fresh beef and lamb, filled with delicious veggies and just the right amount of tzatziki sauce, the real secret to this sandwich lies in the marinated gyro meat, which is cooked and shaved normally, but then cooked again in a special marinade sauce which makes this Gyro one of the juiciest and most satisfying you will ever have.

Dessert is not to be missed either, simple items make a big impact here, with my personal fave being the ice cream and pita. They specially treat the pita for dessert with honey, powdered sugar, and upon request chocolate or raspberry sauce. With a dollop of delicious vanilla in the middle, you will be very satisfied by the simple pleasure. The baklava deserves an honorary mention as well.

Everything on the menu is great, but more importantly, this restaurant provides an amazing family-dining feel that seems like you're stepping into George's living room. Getting to know the owners is part of the charm of this small but excellent spot. 

Final Verdict: If you have an option to choose between winning a million dollars or eating at Saba's, take the million dollars and then spend all of it on Gyros at Saba's afterwards."}
{"text":"Cute family business! The humus is amazing! Great service! I filled up on humus so had to get my lunch to go! Looking forward to my gyro for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, locally owned place with some pretty delish food.  The meat is exceedingly tasty and veggies fresh and crisp.  Sauces are pretty bold and garlic forward.  My hubby and I share the three meat meal and it's more than enough for both of us and the two kids.  One minus, our takeout order came with only one pita.  I called and let them know that I thought it was odd.  Apparently you're supposed to order additional pita.  This seems a bit chintzy to me.  At the very least, let the to-go orders know.  I'm happy to pay for more but once you're home, it's not like you'll go back out.  

Overall, the food is tasty and healthy - grilled meats, veggies & salad."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is fantastic and the servers are more than friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"Ick.

It was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  

In retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a \"World Famous Gyro\" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.

Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  

Uh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.

Guess you get what you pay for...."}
{"text":"Great food! I've been looking for a good place to get Mediterranean food for quite some time and they have definitely delivered. You can tell the gyro is fresh and it has a smokey taste to it. The Greek fries are also delicious. Also, everyone I have come in contact with has been very nice and my food always come out quickly ."}
{"text":"So, just happened upon this place, the server, after I've already had a double cocktail, asks if I'm driving... Call me weird, but I thought that was the most responsible thing ever. Oh, the food is damn good too. Cozy, and the outside is deceiving."}
{"text":"The Sleepy Gyro Salad was very good and quite filling. I went with the large."}
{"text":"Been coming here for at least 15 years. Never disappoints! Service is always family friendly, food is always on point, and restaurant is clean.  They are able to modify to any dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Saba's for about 10 years and it is always a delight! They have a ton of choices, the food is incredibly flavorful, and the prices are very fair. This place is really a hidden gem - tucked in the corner of the strip mall on the corner, it doesn't seem like it would be a great dine in location, but it is! They recently redecorated (or maybe it was within the last year), but they have really created a beautiful atmosphere. The service was kind and attentive. 

I went with my parents, and both ordered salads. The \"regular\" is plenty large. My dad opted for the \"large\" and found himself with way more than he could eat (which is saying a lot for my dad!). I made my own two-item platter with falafel & baba ganoush. The falafel were very galick-y, which I love, and I got about 9 falafel! It was a ton of food, and I ended up eating it for days. We also got a hummus appetizer, and that was a great way to start the meal.

I'm glad this place is doing well, it really is a neighborhood joint. It seems like the owner & staff knew most of the customers coming in, whether for dine-in or pick-up. Give this place a try, and you will fall in love! Also, they have a check-in offer of 10% off!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Saba's for years now, and the food was always good. Last night we got our dinner to go, and it was pretty bad. We had the calamari appetizer, which has always been wonderful. Last night, it was undercooked, it was practically raw, and it smelled fishy. If we had been dining in, I would have returned it. I had my usual Falafal sandwhich, and it also wasn't very good. The Greek fries were soggy and limp, not crisp.  I don't know what was wrong, if it was just an off night, of if they are going downhill. I have no desire to go back, and it was one of our favorite restaurants. I give them 2 1/2 stars, because they used to be 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Delicious, when was the last time you ate all homemade food at a restaurant!? 

We'll get ready for it here. The best gyro meat I've ever tasted. Normally it's hardly warm and tasteless, not at sabas, it's charbroiled to give a slight bark and the flavor is so so good. Homemades sauces and great service."}
{"text":"Meh. 
Its good. I have been here before...its just not the best. 

I had a bad craving for a falafel sandwich, only pita jungle is a bit more of a drive from my work. So I called up Saba's and placed a pick up order. 

When I got there, I was promptly ignored and not greeted even though there were 2 people behind the cash register. The old man grunted at me and pointed at the order I just watched him bag up (I had placed an order for 4 people, nothing crazy by any measure) I asked if I could give him half cash and the rest on my card...I get another grunt (more of a disapproving grunt), this clearly put him in a bad mood. I said thank you I don't know how many times, but that wasn't enough. 

When i got back to work I was a bit disappointed. I ordered a side salad with my falafel and the house dressing was some really weird dressing I have never had, though the lettuce was very fresh and crisp...My falafel its self was ok. The patties were good, the pita bread got super soggy really fast and I was sad to see no onions or cucumber or hummus in it like pita jungle does. 

If my co workers wanted to go here again, I would most likely order something else and give it another try, but wouldn't suggest it if it was up to me."}
{"text":"Is six stars an option. We love this family owned business. They go out of their way to make every experience a good one. The staff cares and has fun too. The portions are huge and the prices fair. The quality of the food serves is as good as you can find. (Take them up on the offer to grill your gyro meat). I heard the owner handle a complaint over the phone and he couldn't be apologetic enough. When the customer came in he was treated like a best friend and everyone was happy. Can't get enough of this mom and pop establishment"}
{"text":"I like Sabas for a number of reasons. It's family owned (be sure to check out the family photos on the wall); they're local (not many choices other than fast food nearby) and the hummus is actually on the tasty side (unusual on Phoenix). 

The service is hit or miss depending on the day and time. It has limited seating inside and often the only table available is the one where the restroom might as well pull up a chair its so close. Pricing is reasonable and the specials are good without fail.  

Worth a visit but only to get take out."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and what a little hidden gem ! Menu outside got our YES to come in .. So many delicious sounding choices was hard to choose from ! Open the door and what cute decor , I was expecting like a taco shop feel or sandwich shop but it's a cute little restaurant hole in the wall place :)  (which I love). We got the fresca pita and world famous with spicy feta fries , so good you just can't stop eating no matter how full you are ! Flavor is good , all the meat is fresh , chicken in mine was all white meat :) no fatty gross pieces . We will def be back !"}
{"text":"I have been going to Saba's for over 10 years now and always had a good experience. Up until today I would rate it 4 stars. Yummy falafel, delicious vegetarian red lentil soup were among my favorites. Their house dressing is lemony goodness. 

But today's visit pushed them to a 5 star for me.

While running errands, I stopped in for a quick bite. I intended to keep it light and healthy. Which is very easy to do here. Salads, vegetarian pitas, soups are all healthy choices they have that are also very delicious. 

They have added some exciting additions to their menu since I have last been in.

I see the rolled hummus sandwich which I have had before and enjoyed. Pita, hummus (which now you can choose from different kinds- I chose pesto hummus), lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and a pickle. Yum. And I knew I wasn't completely blowing my diet.

Then I see Greek fries and my heart stops. Feta, herbs and spices, and lemon wedges on fries?? Would I like to add them on to my wrap? Um, yes please.

I was kicking myself for doubling my calorie intake while I was waiting for my food. 

The food comes out fast and all my guilt and self-loathing are replaced by pure desire for the food I'm about to consume. The portions were ginormous. Big enough for 2. I make a deal with myself to only eat half the fries. The fries covered with the most feta and spices of course. The pita was crunchy, hummus-y yummyness. The fries were so damn tasty. 

The prices, especially the sandwiches and salads, are very reasonably priced. I checked out the drink menu and noticed bottled beers were between $3 and $3.50. Not bad at all. They had a couple unique beers by the bottle and by tap. 

Service was warm, friendly, and prompt. 

Afterwards, I thought \"Why I have been away for so long?\" But I will be back Sabas. Oh yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"Yesssss!!!!!!! Finally a good Greek restaurant!! And they have saganaki! Their spicy feta fries are killer and the gyro meat is so tender. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delish!
Lots of yummy food!
We have lived in the area over 2 years and never stopped in. What a shame! 
Now we know better. 
Great food. Friendly workers."}
{"text":"Service can be iffy, but the traditional gyro is my favorite! Their fries are GREAT! This is another one of my go-to joints. Love the food, the ambiance and the close location. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We love eating here and order takeout almost every other week. My favorite place in Arizona for babaganosh. The flavors are great and the service is always fantastic. The shwarma is very authentic and good as a sandwich or alone as part of a plate."}
{"text":"Had the Lamb Shawarma Pita - generous helping of very tender lamb in pita. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This isn't much of a place for the \"expierience\" but the cheap eats and decent food paired with fast and efficient servers makes this an easy 5 stars. 

They have a few items you can make vegan, the Gyro lunch special is great. You can get just the Gyro for $5 or make it a combo for $6.50. For that you get a nice pita wrapped around some of the better falafel in the valley with lettuce, tomato and tahini and a good portion of a side of fries or other side of your choice.  It's not the best I have ever had but compared to other Falafel offerings in Phoenix, which are downright horrible at times, it's pretty good. 

The service is always friendly but not overly bearing and the servers are usually always the same people at lunch and they are always on top of things and now whats up. The food comes out fast so it's great for a quick lunch spot while still getting sit down service."}
{"text":"LOVE Saba's, it's one of our favorite restaurants. It's a small hole in the wall greek place, seems family run, great menu and really affordable. The gyros and platters are SO good and the hummus is the best I've ever had. The staff is fabulous, always friendly, fast service! This place is good for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood eateries. My family and I have been eating here off and on for 15 years.  Mom and pop establishment that serves excellent Greek/Mediterranean food. Mint flavored ice tea is awesome. Great gyros, humus, salads, and dinner combos. Not a bad pick on the menu. The quality of the food and service will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"What a great little secret!  From the front I had no idea there was even anyone in the place. Then I opened the door and it was packed with diners, Middle Eastern music playing sort of low. Diners all chatting.  And the smells!  Omg!  So I ordered a safe cheeseburger for the finicky grandson and some hummus and grape leaves and a gyro to split with the granddaughter. And we ate outside. They both loved the food. Even the grandson took seconds on the hummus. Oddly enough the opportunity arose 3 days later for a house warming party and we bought food for 15. Except there was enough for 30.  Try the lamb shanks. The food is the best M.E. Food I have ever had and I'm a Greek. Several of us agreed the baklava was by far the best we gave ever had.  Sooooo good.  Thanks George."}
{"text":"We loved our Greek salad,  the dressing was very zesty.    I had the chicken pita which was typical of a standard gyro. Now my guest had the lamb gyro which she said was moist and tasted amazing compared to any other she ever had. 

The staff was very nice and took time to educate us on the menu. It would be nice if there were pictures because everything sounds yummy!

At about 615pm the place became packed and people were waiting to be seated.

Overall a good experience and we will be back.

 he best dressing I have had.  Our gyros one lamb and one chicken were moist and flavorful.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers, for helping us find this fabulousness!
We were at the MIM and developed a taste for Greek (somewhere around the Greek section of the museum), did a search on Yelp and decided the reviews were great AND this was soooo close. So why not?
It was all sorts of yumminess. Started with the Greek Fries... good start. I had Chicken Shawarma and the hubs had a Shawarma (and I didn't pay attention, was chatting and eating). My vegetarian sister had a Starter combination with 5 different appetizers, all equally yummy.
We were not let down! All was good. My sister and I had leftovers enough for lunch the next day.

Comfortable, clean, friendly staff. Good prices, fabulous food.

We HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This is just a wonderful Mediterranean restaurant. We have tried many of the dishes and continue to be amazed at the outstanding flavor of all the dishes we experienced. Definitely a must try, gyros \"Chicago style\",Greek fries, lemon rice soup, it's all delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected, but it definitely has some flavorful bite-worthy menu items. Giving it some flare from and setting it apart from your typical Greek spot. 

 *** Must Try ***



* Steak Pita: Tender angus beef it's ridiculously good and melts like butter 

* Grandmas Meat Dolmas: Stuffed with rice, pine nuts, and fresh herbs 

* Red Lentil Soup: Not just your typical Greek lentil soup, they add a little kick making a delicious subtle spicy tomato herb  soup 

Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"My little sister works just down the street and discovered this through work friends. She asked that our family bring her here for her birthday dinner. 

This is a great little place. The food is amazing and the service is great. We had an assortment of the hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves, falafel and tabbouleh. All amazing. We then all got different meals, i got their gyro just to try what they claim was the best, and it was. Everything was fresh and authentic and delicious and the waiter was so patient with my insane little family! 

I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"I've been back to this restaurant since my last review. They have been taken over by the kids.  Things are running smoothly, service is great, and food is healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"This place was good. We got the flaming cheese skillet, it was so fun to see but also was very good. I thought the price was pretty standard for a greek restaurant. The fries could have used a little of that orange seasoning I usually see at other places, the yellow rice was good, tzatziki sauce was good, lamb kebab was flavored well, gyro meat was good but a little too smokey, chicken shawarma looked like chicken breast but was fine. I think I would repeat everything I ordered again, with the exception of the chicken shawarma - was just a little boring compared to everything else.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, and I have never been more impressed.

The gyros are great! The Chicago style is my favorite but this time I tried the Philly Gyro. I think I have a new favorite. 

We were waited on by the owner (George). He was very attentive and answered all of our questions. The prices are super as well. If you have not been here then I would recommend you stop by for lunch as soon as possible.

The only downside is that it is located in a very small space. It doesn't make that big of a difference unless it is busy.

Keep doing things right, George!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch!  Might be for dinner also, but I have only been there for lunch.  The Chipotle Chicken Gyro is awesome!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here because I can always trust the food to be nothing short of AMAZING. The staff is incredibly friendly, fast, and really knows the menu like the back of their hand!

I can never go wrong starting with George's Caprese along with a cup of their lemon rice soup. Just the 2 items alone will satiate me and my appetite, but for those days where I just have a mighty need to devour my weight in food I'll add their world famous gyro and a side of the spicy feta fries, which is something I'd never heard of before coming here. Fries covered in Buffalo sauce and Feta cheese... it sounds strange but DAMN is it freaking delicious!!

They have a little bit of everything for everyone, so you can't go wrong coming here!"}
{"text":"Low key spot where you can be super casual or take a date. Sabas has REALLY good mediterranean food. Quick and friendly services and food is ALWAYS fresh! Good variety of Greek beer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!! Great family owned atmosphere and even better food!!! :)"}
{"text":"We've found our new favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  Had the chicken shawarma, with the pesto hummus and Greek fries. Yum! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing. The best Greek fries I've ever had.  Still crispy despite all the toppings. I've never had pesto hummus, but I'm a fan now. Can't wait to return and try other things on the menu!  Next time the Spicy Greek Fries. Another patron had the Flaming Baklava while we dinned, needless to say after that performance, we'll be trying that next time.  And I don't want to forget to mention, everyone was super friendly. It was a pleasure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dive restaurants in Scottsdale. 

It's hard to find lamb anywhere, let alone good lamb. 

The lamb at Sabas's is good (not great).

But it's the atmosphere, great waiters, like Jared, that make this a five star place that you'll return to often."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time. Ordered carry out. I got the spicy feta fries which were the best thing ive ever eaten in my life and I got the ckicken kabobs which were also very very good. It was really busy but I would definitely come here again and again and again. My new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here for a few years now...Mainly just for lunch.  Stopped by today to grab a gyro sandwich to go...it was good, can't beat the lunch special price!  

We usually just have the lamb or traditional gyros, vegetarian plates, or an entree salad..have tried their entrees and they are just OK..so I stick to the tried and true....if I am hankering for a gyro I think of Saba's"}
{"text":"I love this place! I love Mediterranean food and used to go to pita jungle all the time... until I found this little gem. Don't get me wrong pita jungle is great but this place has better prices and authentic delicious food. It's family owned so the service is always great and friendly. We frequently walk in and order take out because it's healthy and fast. The chicken salad is delicious and the gyro meet is awesome too. The hummus and pita is also very good and they give warm pitas if you take out or eat in. They have a good assortment of alcohol too! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I crave this place and drive from Peoria to eat here every chance I get. Baba Ghannouj is outstanding. I have been coming here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Came here for lunch today and I had the Greek salad and a cup of lentil soup. Fresh and healthy and yummy! Price is good for the freshness and quality. Fast service too!"}
{"text":"Small space, was slammed on a Friday afternoon, but didn't wait very long for a table.  Had the chicken shwarma, spicy pesto fries, and hummus.  Attentive service, ample portion size, all quite delicious...loved the pesto fries.  Definitely got to try again."}
{"text":"My kids and I stopped at Saba's in between soccer games and we all loved this place! The staff was very nice, and the food was delicious. The pita was fresh, the hummus was amazing, and I'm so glad the server recommended the saganaki. My kids thought the flaming cheese was pretty cool to see! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food nice people here. The gyros are the best I've had in the area by far. We come here every time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their \"World Famous\" gyro is best. It's really the only thing I ever order. DH's usual dish is the Chicken on the Greens salad which is like a super-charged (generously portioned) Greek salad with delicious chicken. Greek fries are loaded with goodies and quite tasty (if you eat-in, doesn't travel well). I don't love the hummus here but for me, it doesn't even matter. Get the \"World Famous\" gyro!!"}
{"text":"Sabas has been my \"go-to\" Mediterranean place for going on 20 years now. Family owned. Awesome people. Awesome food.. Literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Most of the time I need to restrain myself from ordering too many things! Because it's literally all great! Hummus, Saganaki (probably not spelling that correctly) Soups,Authentic Pita Sammiches of all kinds, and The Lamb Shank...Omg The Lamb Shank :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing from the time we came in till we left.  Food, service was absolutely excellent.  The service that George gave was a good as we have ever had.  Thank you all at Saba's!"}
{"text":"Shocked. That's what I was because from the outside, this place is plain but once inside, it is anything but.

Although there is a distinct Greek theme here, the place gave off a more middle Eastern vibe (much more so than Greece based on my recent trip to Greece this summer).

I love gyros but wasn't hungry enough for one in a pita, so I ordered a regular size Greek salad with gyro meat, aptly named Sleepy Gyro Salad. So tasty and so much food! 

Our waitress glided to our table. She was also busy, when she wasn't caring for customers, she was sweeping or vacuuming. 

Definitely a place I'll return to if I find myself this far north in the future."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for quite a while...and now, I wonder why? We had a very good meal with attentive, friendly service in a casual and authentic environment on a busy weeknight.

We loved the dolmades- tightly wrapped, flavorful filling- not mushy.  The lamb schwarma was tender, tasty and delicious! I love their basmati rice and also had my entree with tabbouleh which was yummy in my fresh pita with the lamb! The falafel gyro was also very good."}
{"text":"AMAZZZING! My favorite restaurant in all the Phoenix metro area!! The Gyro is to die for and the Greek salad is out of this world delicious! The meat is super high quality and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Saba's and I went based on all the positive reviews. I was extremely excited because who doesn't love a local joint with good food?!? I even easily convinced a friend to accompany me. 

Sadly, we were not impressed. Contrary to all the reviews, I found our waitress unfriendly. Only at the time we were paying our bill, did she smile and ask if I wanted a drink for the road. How about using that same attitude at the start of service and not at the end?!? 

The food. We started by getting the hummus. The pita bread was cold and hard. The hummus was okay. Having lived in Dearborn, Michigan for many years, I've had much better hummus and pita in my lifetime, so Saba's fell short by a long haul! 

I got the Chicago style Gyro. The meat was a little crunchy, as described, but it was over salted and not very flavorful. And so so dry-- a little more tzatziki sauce would have been nice. My friend got the Chicken Pita and her's was just as dry as mine. 

Overall, it was a \"meh\" type of experience and sadly I don't think I'll be going back..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you are a vegetarian or vegan. The service is great an fast and very nice and helpful servers."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. I always get the Chicago gyro and fries. The Chicago gyro has the meat slightly grilled and is so full of flavor. I don't know what they put in the sauce but it is by far the best sauce I have ever had. Even their fries are good!!!  

Saba's is always busy every time I'm there. Dining in or getting a Togo order it doesn't matter!  My kids ask to come here all the time. Needless to say this is a family favorite of ours. But Saba's isn't only a favorite of mine but a favorite to many in this area as you will notice by how busy they always are. The staff is so friendly and they get to know you which makes coming here even better. The manager is super helpful when ordering and having questions about the menu. One time the cooks put the green garnish on my daughters rice. The manager knew that rice was for a child and quickly had them replace it with no garnish. He is very attentive and genuinely cares about the food and his customers which is nice to see. 

If you want super good Mediterranean food this is the place to go. You will not regret it. However you may find yourself frequenting this establishment more then others!"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in the neighborhood! Great service, and amazing food. Plus it's locally owned!"}
{"text":"Seriously the most flavorful amazing and delicious gyros I've had in a long, long time. Hummus was extra garlicy... Just how I like it! It is pricey for the amount that you get... But the meat alone is totally worth it. Gotta get it Chicago style."}
{"text":"Ambiance is really nice. You can tell they hold on to their roots and take pride in being family owned. They have beautiful photos of the Christian quarters in Old Jerusalem that I very much enjoyed as a fellow Palestinian. Loved their \"break the chain, eat local\" slogan. Service was great. The food...

I had a Fattoush salad with chicken shawarma. It was excellent but nothing like a traditional Fattoush salad and I wouldn't consider their chicken as traditional shawarma. They had a good amount of veggies in their salad and the vinaigrette was excellent. I was in a hurry and only ordered a salad because I'm eating healthy but I'll definitely be back to try more food!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I have no idea what these reviews are talking about. Ordered the chicken shawarma, humus, and roast vegetables. 

I kid you not, the shawarma was NOT traditional shawarma, but simply a few pieces of seasoned chicken breast that can be made at home. The pita that accompanied was stale, and not the kind of firmness that you get from grilling it. The staleness seemed like it arose from leaving the pita bread outside. The humus was awful.  As for the vegetables they were terrible - way overcooked and the eggplant was most likely spoiled. I ordered this meal on a Monday at about 5 pm, but that is no excuse to do a poor job. Worse yet, you can get a meal that is 10 times better at Haji Baba in Tempe for less. 

If you are looking to waste your money on terrible food, then that is the only reason to be at Saba's Mediterranean Kitchen."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here that I started drafting this review waiting for our bill. What an amazing Greek/Mediterranean experience. The service was remarkable. This place was packed and we were still given top quality service. The food is amazing! This is the only Greek spot in the entire valley who still serves their saganaki authentically: lighting it on fire right at the table - OPA! This place was so amazing we struck up conversation with two separate tables about what we ordered and if we had tried other items on the menu, as well as how remarkable we thought their service was. One couple mentioned they were from Prescott and after finding this place on Yelp, make a point to stop here on every trip because they love it so much. Highly recommend trying this place! And if you get the gyros sandwich, get it \"Chicago style.\""}
{"text":"Best food in this town if you like Mediterranean that is. Run don't walk and get over here it is scrumptdillyious!  Sleepy Gyro Salad is my favorite!"}
{"text":"So thankful a friend introduced me to this restaurant. I have been there twice and I can't wait to go again. so far I have had the falafel pita with hummus and the gyro plate and both were so good; especially the gyro. Falafel had great texture and flavor. Again, I can't wait to go again and it won't be soon enough. My only complaint (and I'm surprised I would have an issue since I like onions) were I thought the onions on the pita were cut too thick and were a little strong. If they just cut the onions thinner, would be perfect."}
{"text":"I love Sabas!  Their food is fresh and delicious and the people remember who I am, what I like and what my food allergies are.  I love the chicken shwarma and the lamb shwarma either the plate or in a wrap.  They substitute their yogurt dressing for one that I can eat.  I love their salad dressing for the salads.  The humus is really good.  I sometimes get the humus with cucumber instead of pita.  I get the kind of pita that doesn't have milk or eggs in it.  It's not a fancy place but it's warm and inviting and has great food.  Been coming here for years.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mediterranean food. I got the chicken schwarma, steamed veggies and hummus. Big portions so I had enough left over for dinner too."}
{"text":"It's been a year since we visited this part of town.  Had to go and hit this place up as it was great the last time we tried it.  They knocked it out of the park again.  Service is impeccable.  The young lady who seats us, serves us, and cleans up brings tons of energy to the place.  The food, well let's just say we haven't and won't attempt any other Greek food but this place."}
{"text":"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like \"I like it loose, like my women,\" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."}
{"text":"Saba's has never disappointed me in the 15 years that I've been coming here! First off, it's family owned and ran. Everyone is super friendly and hospitable. The food is superb! Definitely get the saganaki to start! My go to dish here is always the Greek salad with chicken. Their side of pitas with their tazitki sauce that accompanies it is the perfect meal!"}
{"text":"This is NOT authentic Mediterranean. For starters all of their Arabic dishes were absolutely awful. We ordered Shawarma and got grilled chicken style pieces
Completely covered in garlic aioli. More shocking was the beef Shawarma my husband ordered.. they served shredded beef!  

Hummus was awful, grainy, watery and flavorless, presentation was awful and not appetizing, very overpriced and place is dingy. 

Very confused by the good reviews. Disappointing Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great discovery! Small local family owned, say Hi to George when you go. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is fantastic, authentic and very fairly priced. Service is great. We will be eating here as often as possible. Highly recommend! Oh, try the Greek Salad with chicken."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years, and the food is great. My Israeli friend says it's the best he has found in Phoenix area. My Armenian friend also was taken aback when I brought him here. He had taken me to a place in Scottsdale that was the best middle eastern place he knew in town, and was pleasantly surprised with Saba's as his new favorite. I did give it 5 stars when mom and dad did the cooking, but it's still the best I've found."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant. Alway good. Great serve and very friendly. Get your gyro meat crispy and you'll be in heaven. Also, try the feta fries as a appetizer."}
{"text":"Very delicious geek food.
I had the lemon pepper shrimp pita sandwhich. Hummus was very good too. Fresh pita bread to top it off."}
{"text":"First time trying Saba's and I wasn't that impressed. I got the 2 entree option with chicken and steak kabob. As for the sides, I got humus and the yellow rice. When the food came out, the rice was hard and cold, the chicken was over cooked and dry. The steak was also very chewy and not fresh, didn't have a lot of flavors. Hummus was heavy on the garlic ingredients, and the pita bread was hard and cold. Just so disappointed in the overall quality and quantity of the food. Quite pricey for the amount of food. 1 star for the new outdoor porch which was nice to sit at and 1 star for the customer service. I would perhaps give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Mediterranean food.  They have great hummus and baba  ganoush.  I love the build your own appetizer plate.  We have been going here for almost 10 years now and wont stop anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a very cute little neighborhood Mediterranean restaurant. Tonight we tried and enjoyed the hummus, baba, and gyros. Super casual atmosphere, but great flavor and great service will bring us back to Saba's again."}
{"text":"Saba's is one of our favorite local places since the service, food and menu prices never disappoint!  
Our family of four is routinely sat within minutes and the service is always prompt, polite and welcoming. 
We have recently tried to incorporate more vegetables in out diet so we have frequented Saba's more often and continue to enjoy this great establishment which has the best falafel pita, hands down!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Mediterranean food. Flaming cheese appitizer is a excellent starter. The lamb is normally served medium and I ordered it medium rare. It was cooked perfectly. The pita bread come two ways. As a fluffy light pita and the second a pita pocket which is thinner. Both are excellent and delightful to eat with your dinner. Gyro meat is very tasty. If you like it sliced from a large block as we do you love this place. Steak kabob also super tender and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Great menu, great service , 10% discount when you check in. My husband ordered dolmas, falafel, and chicken schwarma with baba ganoush and somehow managed to finish it all! My daughter and I had lamb shanks that fell off the bone in a wonderful sauce. My other daughter had a lamb pasta dish that was also outstanding! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food... Good service... Have visited so many times.. Never got disappointed.. chicken shawarma is a must... You won't forget it's taste... Mediterranean food lovers must visit.."}
{"text":"Amazing mediterranean food! This place is as authentic as it gets, and the family there makes sure to delivery quality eats and a super clean/cozy little hole in the wall. Literally my only complaint was that the a/c was set to arctic storm (haha), but other than that this place is amazing. STAY FOR THE BAKLAVA! It is life changing..."}
{"text":"Might be my FAVORITE new place in Phoenix! Another fabulous find in our first week in our new hometown.  Still awaiting our storage unit- eating out had become a chore until we found Saba's Mediterranean Kitchen.  After learning that we were new to the area, the owner asked a few questions about our local experiences.  We mentioned that we had liked a local competitor's fare.  He smiled, and never made a negative comment saying,\"I'm sure you will love our food, too.\"  We ordered the chipotle gyro platter, falafel gyro platter, and Chicago gyro platter.  As we paid for our food, we were pleased to find that he included small samples of the lemon rice soup and lentil soup- either one is completely wonderful.  What a great surprise that was!  The food was out of this world and is now our favorite place."}
{"text":"The flaming baklava and saganaki are both amazing!  Great service was quick and waitstaff was very attentive."}
{"text":"We have been going to Saba's since it opened many years ago - 20+.  We watched their kids grow up and now one of them is the owner/manager.  The food is CONSISTENT and outstanding.  They change up their menu often which keeps the selections interesting.  Their homemade buffalo sauce (odd for a Mediterranean kitchen) is second to none.  The spicy feta fries should be patented.  The gyros are outstanding and everything else whether it is gyro, beef, chicken or shrimp is fresh with a homemade touch.  The appetizers are yummy and filling and can be a full meal.  The service never fails to be first-rate and friendly.  We are so fortunate to have Saba's in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"My family just moved to the area recently and wanted a healthy, affordable and flavorful dinner.  We had been eyeing this place for a few weeks bc it's so close and felt it was the perfect day to give it a try.  We were greeted by a friendly staff immediately.  My wife and I both ordered the two item plate.  She got the chicken kabob, chicken shawarma, rice and fries.  I got the lamb shank, steak kabob, grilled vegetables and hummus.  The chicken shawarma was delicious but the star of the show was lamb shank!!! So tender and flavorful, the meat just flaked off the bone and so juicy.  The bone also imparted extra flavor.  The tomato based sauce really complimented the meal well.  The hummus was really fresh and flavorful as well too.  We were treated to some fresh baklava for dessert and the pistachio/nut filling was on point.  The staff of Jared and Cliff were just so attentive and friendly.  Great neighborhood restaurant with fresh ingredients and delicious food, I know my family and I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are always great. The menu is just the right size and there are options to splurge or eat healthy. Small selection of wine and beer too.  My wife loves the shrimp dishes and the chipotle chicken pita (or gyro meat) is delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over ten years. They are simply the best. Family tradition and quality have sustained the genuine flavor and character of this excellent restaurant. I privately continue to hope they don't get any more popular so that \"my favorite little Mediterranean place\" retains its original charm, originality and distinction."}
{"text":"First time here the other day, was out running errands and decided to stop in here and give it a try. The place is fairly small and it was packed, we did have to wait a short time for a table, not more than 5 minutes. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming, offered to bring us tea while we waited for our table. I was pleasantly surprised there were many Gluten Free items to choose from. I ordered the Sleepy Gyro Salad and my friend ordered the Chicken Schwarma Pita. We both really enjoyed our lunches. As busy as they were the service did not suffer. And our order came out pretty quickly considering how busy the place was. It didn't let up the entire time we were there either. Our server was nice and attentive. I do want to mention that the small Sleepy Gyro Salad was huge and I had the leftovers for lunch the following day so I would only recommend the larger size if you have an appetite to match. My friend's pita came with fries that I had to taste being a fry fanatic, and they were pretty decent, sprinkled with feta cheese. Mmm cheese. Yeah. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but not crazy amazing either.  I ordered the Lam Shwarma with baba ganoush.  I wasn't thrilled with the lamb and the baba ganoush was good, but not the best I've ever had.  My family ordered the chicken shwarma and that was pretty tasty.  I'd love to visit this place again when I am in Scottsdale to try out the other menu items.  

The wait staff left something to be desired as we were left without drink refills for some time."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood restaurant--casual, delicious, family-owned (I believe the second generation is running it now), great friendly staff . . . it's our go-to for gyros, hummus, and pistachio baklava!!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to this restaurant in years. Let's start by mentioning the ambiance, which is sad. The place is long, narrow, and dark. Those requiring handicap seating are literally forced to the back of this bus. The food was good enough; the mint iced tea and grilled vegetables particularly good. The combination platter we ordered was good sized and the price for what we received was very good deal. Special kudos to our server who approached her work with pleasant professionalism. I would certainly agree to returning."}
{"text":"We so enjoyed this restaurant...Lamb Shank...deliciousWe absolutely love sabers restaurant it just doesn't get better than this. It is like a trip to the Mediterranean ."}
{"text":"A decent place to get gyros, hummus, etc, plus friendly service. My boyfriend is a fan, so I've been a few times. We usually get the triad of hummus, which is obviously freshly made. They have plain hummus along with pesto, chipotle, and buffalo flavors. Their lemon rice soup is very good - I've never had anything quite like it before. If you've never had it before, I recommend trying a cup. My favorite entree order has been the gyro salad, that way I get more greens and I can make my own little gyros with pita. 

Final verdict is if you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for Greek food, stop by."}
{"text":"Great food for either take out or dine in.  The staff is friendly and engaging.  If you want authentic Mediterranean, this is the place.  We are always bummed when they are closed so we load up when they are open!"}
{"text":"Ended up shopping near here by accident and happened upon this place. Excellent food and service.  We will be coming back often."}
{"text":"I love Sabas! It is the best Mediterranean restaurant in Phoenix. The service is always great. The food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"First off I want to say coming from Michigan that this is one of the very few places you can find good middle eastern food! My sister and I came in today and we have been searching all of AZ for good lemon rice soup like the way they make it Coney Island but couldn't until today. This place seriously has the best of the best lemon rice soup by far! Everyone there was so nice as well. We were greeted with a hello and seated right away. Everything we ordered was absolutely phenomenal and then we asked for some hot sauce that was seriously so goood! It was different than your regular hot sauce and was more like salsa/chili based but just really good. The owner was very good to us and even through in some baklava which again was by far amazing! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"We order take out from Saba's, it's one of our favorites. Everyone is so nice and accommodating.
We love to be able to support our local businesses!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've ever had. I frequent this restaurant even though there is a mediterttanean restaurant near my home. The staff are very friendly and make the dining experience great. I take all my visitors here and they rave about it."}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone thinks sabas is so good? I got some gross smelling soggy falafel that were clearly made days ago. also, it's a bit dingy and old inside, good ambience and music though, good attempt, work on the food quality a bit."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. ..Food was wonderful and the owner was personable.   We Had shwarma, Falafel,  gyro.  Great food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My all time fav place. I go there pretty much every other week with my office buddies. Everything on the menu is amazing. Try George's fav and i can bet you that you will go back again. 
Best Mediterranean restaurant:)"}
{"text":"I had previously written a review giving two stars because we had a bad experience at Sabas on a night where they were short staffed due to sick employees.  However, the fact that the owner responded to my review and apologized means a lot and shows how committed they are to providing great service and using feedback to make changes. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This is really good. I've only gotten their gyro and fries, but my husband has ordered different things and always likes what he gets too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Mediterranean food. I love their chicken kabob plate, love their hummus, and my son raves about their lamb shank. I always have to stop for a bite when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great selection of vegetarian pitas!  I prefer the falafel pita, however the other choices are excellent as well.  Saba's also has a great sides like hummus and pita or their delicious Greek Fries.  I've been a regular at Saba's for a few years now and their service and food is exemplary!  I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone craving some Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed tonight :( I have been here a handful of times & it's usually pretty good not the best nor the worst I have had but reasonably priced & clean atmosphere. Tonight my fries were cold & not cooked all the way through bummer :( the gyro was piping hot & fresh first bite was great but then it was so hot it all fell apart so I then had to eat with a fork I always get my ordered to go. Overall I would say three stars is good for this place."}
{"text":"This was our first time here but it won't be our last. Jared, our server was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is nice, the copper ceiling tiles were beautiful and the pictures of family made it a welcoming place. I had a bowl of lentil soup that was delicious- a slight tomato taste- different but delicious. My husband and I shared the chicken gyro and it was great as well. Large pieces of juicy chicken, great sauces and flavors. Even the French fries were above average. Prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent. Jared even sent us home with some baklava- can't wait to try it. Lots of vegetarian items, good wine selection. Thoroughly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Service was great here, the gentleman who served us was friendly and our food was served quickly. I was expecting a fast food place, but it is actually a sit down restaurant, small and comfortable. I ordered the chicken kebab plate and my husband had a gyro with an additional side of gyro meat. I also had a cup of the lemon and rice soup. The soup was good and creamy, not  like I've had it in other places. It was also warm, almost lukewarm, not hot at all. I wasn't sure if they served it at this temperature purposely or if they just didn't heat it up enough. I think it may have come from a crock pot that I could see from where I was sitting. The tabouli was good but not as lemony as I like. The chicken kebabs were pretty good. My husband really enjoyed his gyro, and the gyro meat, which I had a bite of, was very good! I would not say this is the best Mediterranean food I have had, but all in all, this place had good service and good food, just a matter of personal preference, I guess."}
{"text":"Saba's has been my local Greek place for over 10 yrs, and it just keeps improving. It was never bad ,so this makes this place amazing. Everyone near Bell n Tatum knows how good it is because Saba's is busy on a Thursday not just the weekend. Great homemade hummus with fresh soft pita bread, terrific gyros sandwich and various great salad.  My friend from Penang loves the lamb shank! The place started by a great couple is now run by the next generation who continue the great food and great service at a great price! Lovr Saba's!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience when we come here, whether we do take out, or eat in. Casual, laid back atmosphere for eating in, but great, prompt service. We love splitting a sleepy jyro salad!!!"}
{"text":"A great lunch stop. I always get the Grilled Chicken Pita and a cup of soup. The Red Lentil soup is so fabulous that I taught myself how to make a similar version. I also love their Lemon Soup. Great family owns this. It hops at lunch. Healthy and satisfying."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we were looking for a yummy Mediterranean restaurant! We had the chicken scwharma, gyro, with Hummus and Greek fries. So glad we tried this place. Everything we got was amazing!! Cannot wait to go back to try more items. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This place kicks butt. Small little dining area. Very private and friendly. I only order the Gyro, they are just too good. I can't NOT order the gyro. These are so good my 4 year old eats them, with tzatziki and everything. So that says a lot because kids rarely know good food..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place!!! Yummy, yummy, clean, courteous and delicious! Been coming here for years and it just keeps getting better! Can I give it 6 stars?"}
{"text":"Noticed the Big WORLD'S FAMOUS GYRO sign out front. walked in, very nice and friendly staff. awesome service. Unfortunately the gyro I got was really soggy, the meat and sauce was everywhere, not fresh, and the bread had a very distinct burnt taste to it. The fries were gross... I don't know what went wrong with this place, but it was packed out with people eating awesome looking salads.... I guess I ordered the wrong thing"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous lunch here. My wife ordered the gyro salad with the meat charred and it was huge with a delicious dressing. We split it along with the combo  pesto hummus and babaghanouj dip. These were fresh made and were the most delicious we have ever had. The waiter was very friendly and eager to please with a smile. Only thing a little below par was the pita bread. Maybe too long under the heat lamp."}
{"text":"I'm still not sure if it was the service, food, or overall experience that impressed me most in my visit to Saba's. 

The service was absolutely amazing. We went here with a party of 6 and no reservation, and they offered to move a reserved table to another location to give us a booth. From offering samples of the daily soup, bringing an extra order of fries when received a side instead of a shared basket, to bringing us extra baklava for the table while not even charging us for the order of baklava for the birthday girl. 

The food was flavorful and diverse with lots of options for all kinds of preferences. The chicken shawarma was delicious and fresh. The spicy fries were so good! Loved the presentation of the flaming cheese and flaming baklava. DEFINITELY order the flaming baklava: the sugars caramelize and make a favorite treat even better. 

The overall experience left me wanting to go back soon and bring people with me. There are a lot of options for Mediterranean food in the valley, but everything else that makes Saba's unique will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. Fabulous baba ganoush! Cute place with friendly service."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks kind of small, but inside there are many booths and tables. 
But this place is awesome!! Carl was our server and he was great too!! He helped us with the menu and helped us decide on our meals.  I settled on lamb pita w/ spicy feta fries and thee wife had a gyro salad. Delicious!! We will definitely be back whenever we visit the Mayo Clinic or the area. Thanks Carl!!"}
{"text":"We highly recommend this place for lunch.  Grab a bite to eat and sit outside on their porch; their Mint Iced Tea is really refreshing on a hot day.  We ordered two Chicago Gyros and shared their Spicy Feta Fries.  The Fries are just mildly spicy, but we thought adding Buffalo Sauce (Commonly seen on Hot Wings) was a great idea that we'll steal and use at home.  The combination with Feta really hit the spot.  They serve a good and fresh tasting Gyro.  We can't speak for it's authenticity, but our meal was tasty.  Overall, we enjoyed the food, ambiance, and the friendly employees; we'll be back."}
{"text":"I devoured the World Famous Gyro Pita! So good! Also very affordable. I ordered take out and there were a lot of people in the restaurant and picking up food; I can understand why. I will be frequenting this place from now on."}
{"text":"Most friendly service to go with the great food. Don't forget to get the date dessert."}
{"text":"We tried to eat at sabas tonight but never got service. We had to get our own menus because the guy in the red hat and tattoos couldn't find his way to our table. When he did come and we ordered water he couldn't follow through and bring our water . We had to just leave. We used to really like this place what a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, gyro.  The soup is great too.  Great food, great cost."}
{"text":"Very good food, although a little pricey.  Ordered a take out.  Very nice and polite on the phone.  Food ready quick.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The red lentil soup is out of this world.  I unfortunately live in the East Valley and only go here when my job brings me to this area.  This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the Phoenix Area.  The food is fresh and flavorful.  The restaurant itself is small but the quality of the food more than makes up for that.  Try the Tzatziki and Hummus they are so good."}
{"text":"I love the gyros here. They pile on the meat. Great service as well...not going to lie, don't get the baklava it was not good. I have had a couple salads as well and they were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service! Warm atmosphere and hospitality. I'll be back. Gyros was filling and Jerusalem salad was delicious and enough to take home."}
{"text":"Have visiting this place multiple times since 2010, and it never disappoints me, I have tried chicken shawarma in many places but nothing even comes close to this place.  Best experience was when I went with my parents and i wanted them to taste the best chicken shawarma and they too loved and when the sever came to know it was my parents last day in Phoenix, they gave us a complementary home made Baklava. That made my parents dinner memorable. Thank you!"}
