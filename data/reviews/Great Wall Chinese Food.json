{"text":"Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:("}
{"text":"For pick-up or delivery, this place has some damn good Chinese food!  I'm going to keep it short & sweet- They are QUICK (we've played 'delivery games' and ordered Chinese & pizza at the same time and they have never been beat).  The prices are VERY REASONABLE- for the amount & portions you get.  The QUALITY & TASTE is as delicious as I've ever tasted for Chinese.  Try it for yourself and come back to review- I'll bet you'll love it too!

Btw- THEY DO NOT SMOKE.  There's a review on here that 'they smoke around the food' but I've never seen it.  I even asked them if they smoked and they said no.  I have no idea why someone would lie about that other than to drive business to another place.  So why did you lie Ty G.?  Hmm...?"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Their Egg drop soup is sooo good as is the General Tso's, and they deliver FAST!"}
{"text":"Note: Great Wall offers delivery to Mt. Oliver, Carrick, Bon Air, Arlington, South Side, Allentown, Mt. Washington, Beltzhoover, Knoxville, St. Clair, and my current area of Beechview. 

Delivery from a Chinese restaurant is exactly what Kay prescribed herself this evening. Suffering from a sinus headache, she found that Sweet and Sour Shrimp, a shrimp egg roll, and some Egg Drop Soup eased her discomfort a bit.

Egg Drop Soup isn't something I have had in far too long. Elemental, within its chicken broth were rags of eggs that flew about like Shu Gu in Yan Wang's underworld. Instead of giving me ghostly chills, the soup brought me to peace, the wisps of egg dissipating upon touching my tongue. Egg Drop Soup is one of those dishes that is rather facile to prepare for one's self, yet for some reason takes on a special quality when it comes from a restaurant.

Without a menu to reference, I simply went with General Tso's Chicken and devoured it, broccoli and all. The breading on each dandy, candied, boneless poultry nugget crackled a smidge to reveal the most illicitly tender and moist proteins I've had in recent months. My chewing was minimal and occurred slowly as to savor everything in the plastic tub of viands I was given. 

And on the subject of transit, our dinner arrived to us pleasantly and at the speed of sound. I was concerned since the woman I spoke with on the phone had trouble understanding me and vice versa, but the driver certainly had no trouble finding our abode. This was likely the fastest meal delivery I have ever experienced.

If you live in the neighborhoods I mentioned at the start of this review, get out of the Pizza Rut already and get yourself some above average Chinese from Great Wall tonight or this week or whenever you don't feel much like Mario Batali."}
