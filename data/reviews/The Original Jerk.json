{"text":"Rule number one never eat where there is no line up. If your food comes fast they are trying to get rid of it fast. The food here is amazeing. Oaxtail with spicy gravy. That's the troy special tell Kim troy sent you. Say hi good afternoon be polite and you will  be treated with respect and have an awesome meal. I've had food all over the world and i feel at home here."}
{"text":"Authentic Jamaican food at reasonable prices. Good jerk chicken and pork as well as rice and peas. Coleslaw is excellent and included but you have to ask for it. Busy on Fridays with specialty offerings. Can eat there nut seating and ambience are both limited."}
{"text":"Dont expect fast service, patrons work on West Indian time, too much conversing with staff, second in line 20 mins later still not ordered, gave up and walked out;"}
{"text":"The food is great!  Tried their oxtail and jerk chicken and its hard to find another place that cooks like this.  I would have given it 4 stars, but the service is way to slow.  Don't expect fast service.  Everyone here works in slow-mo! These ppl sure are the true definition of chilled out on the island.  Not recommended when you only have a half hour lunch.  If you have lots of time, it's highly recommended.

{"text":"Got jerk chicken and ox tail with extra gravy. I found myself enjoying the jerk chicken more than the ox tail.  Typical Jamaican restaurant. They didn't put any effort in the designed of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken experience gets a 1/5

Bland, tasteless seemed prepared for the local demographics pallate. Avoid.

Red pea soup.

Had the right idea just too watery and too much coconut cream.

Brown stew fish with food.

Great. Solid 4/5, will be returning any Friday I am in the area for it. (Yes good soup, fish and food only available Friday)."}
{"text":"I just moved close... and I'm glad I found this place.  Their oxtail was pretty good...I'm definitely going back"}
