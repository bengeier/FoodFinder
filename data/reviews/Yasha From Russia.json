{"text":"Being Russian will always make you nostalgic for Russian food. That is why we come to Yasha From Russia for more than 15 years. They have vast variety of Russian and European products that are always fresh. Anytime we come there, we are always greeted with the smile of their friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place.  Good variety of eastern european meats. My wife was searching for some items she would eat as a kid and Yashas actually carried the items.  They were open on memorial day which was nice.  we will be going back for sure. My wife was looking for Mici which isnt exactly carried at Safeway.  and they had it in the freezer along with a wide variety of meats.  the bakery items looked awesome. i will have to update my review when we  go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by quality  of products!  No one item had price tag on it, no wonder why , overpriced!  
I bought  for my grandson  honey cookies  ( pryniki ) they are absolutely  tasteless!  
The meat salad from Deli was worthless,  no meat in it, just carrots, potatoes,  eggs , peas and pickles,  what a shame! 
Chocolate bar $4.99 are you serious!?
The little pies that was fried  in a store did not look  very  appealing,  gray color ! The cold meat cuts looks old !
If you are looking  for authentic  russian  food that would be wrong place to come ! 
Never again !"}
{"text":"This bare- bone market is a tiny slice of Eastern Europe in Phoenix.  Does your grocery list beg for an assortment of smoked fishes and/or canned pate (from turkey to pork)?  This is also where you can go when only Hungarian paprika will do.

Also have fun selection of chocolate and candy."}
{"text":"Great store. But if you've never been to eastern Europe, then take note.
This is not an American style store where you walk in, and poke your finger at them nitpicking about anything and complain like \"OMG this like so...uh, really?!\" 

Products are imported from overseas, and we live in the middle of the desert.
Let that sink in for a moment.

Having been to E.Europe many times and her being from there, finding the store entrance actually in the back, in a large parking lot, where you can park however, with rugged concrete - NOSTALGIC AS HECK! Awesome. Adds to the authentic character (though probably not intentional). Anyone whose been to E.Europe or any post-Soviet country there, will get it.

Inside, you will be treated to some good Russian-language music on the radio and the overwhelmingly mouth-watering smell of their meat section. Hard to explain, but it was also very nostalgic, felt like we were back over there again. Very good!

Don't forget to grab a cart before you go in.

Inside, it's kept clean and stocked with tons of different items from all over E. Europe.
What to check out? Depends on what you want.
This is a Russian store, so you can't go in to buy Pringles and Snickers.
NOPE. Instead, most seem to be from Russia, and some from Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania, Belarus, Georgia, and more.

They have a fine selection of imported beers, wine, sparkling mineral waters, kvass, pickled items, and meats. The minerals waters are especially good, easily beating out anything you'd find an a traditional American store. I recommend researching why they drink sparkling mineral waters so much (mostly for health reasons). In particular, I recommend BORJOMI which comes from Georgia (the country) and Essentuki (in Cyrillic as \"ECCENTYKH\", they're numbered, some can be very salty). They're great for hangovers too.

Try the Kvass! It's great cold and in the summer. It's a carbonated, ferminted/rye-bread type drink. It's very unique in taste, kind of bitter, but also sweet, and tends to grow on you. There's different brands at times, so it can be hard to pick out a good one. Where Kvass Ochakovskiy (Russian) is sweet, it doesn't hold its carbonation as well as Kvas Monastyrskiy (I believe is Latvian) but that latter isn't as sweet. Give a couple of a try and see what you think, it's just a few bucks for a giant bottle.

Buckwheat: no one seems to eat this in America, but they eat it there like Americans eat oatmeal or grits or rice. It's great with butter. 

Crunchy corn-puffs with a frosty powered sugar coating.
Can never remember the name but she grew up on these and the family loves them.
Usually where they have the cookies and stuff. 

About 85% of everything is in Cyrillic, btw.
The staff have always been very friendly so don't be shy to ask for help.

Beer? I recommend Baltika. They have #7 and #9 at times, the former is lighter, the latter is much darker. Check the expiration dates though.

THE MEATS:
The sliced meats are excellent, high quality. It's nothing like what you can get in normal stores, people have different tastes. BUT they DO give you free samples, so you can try before you buy. They have a section of canned fish, like sardines, and a section of dried fish (another E.European ex-USSR staple). The latter go great with beer, BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE BONES. 

Good selection of wines from all over. 
Try \"Soviet Champagne\" ( ). A good classic.

Lastly, the home-made bread. This is excellent. You can get a giant loaf of the bread. If you go in the morning, you might even get it while it's still warm. It's a darker bread (not too dark) and extremely good. 

Coffee: pick up some Jacobs instant coffee while you are there. It's instant but has a smell/flavor, nostalgic.

Pricing-wise, you can get in/out without spending too much, but remember, they have tons of imported items. The deli section has great prices given the unique meats they have.

THE DRAWBACKS:
-you'll find expired products at times. you need to check the dates on EVERYTHING you get. Some things are not that bad if expired (like alcohol) but still, if you have a sensitive stomach or just don't want anything expired, then CHECK the dates. REMEMBER, E.Europe, they date differently. The date is not \"when it expires\" but when it was made, and they will put how many months it's good for; so if it has US-style date, and you see the old, that's just what the manufacturer printed from there.
-Sometimes they will run out of stock on items you like/get used to, and will have to wait a week or so for a new shipment. That can be a bummer.

Overall, a very special place. A one of a kind!
Keep in mind, it's not American style food, so don't go there thinking everything will meet American tastes.There is a wealth of items to try there. Yasha's is very special, for that reason, and highly recommended."}
{"text":"i use to go to this place few years ago and then i forgot about it after moving to another city.i just saw it on YELP and i remember their amazing selection.I think it is time for some russian caviar."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Most of the foods we purchased there were without the expiration dates on the packaging. And they turned out to be either spoiled or inedible because they were to hard to chew on. European marshmallows, bread sticks were all expired. Some of the meats and cheeses we got there were quite nice and the expiration dates were clearly visible on the packaging. I'm honestly surprised with the positive reviews since the majority of foods sold there is expired and therefore is inedible."}
{"text":"I came in to get a selection of smoked fish to serve as appetizers for a holiday gathering.  I was absolutely overwhelmed by everything this little store stocks.  Blini, cheeses, sausages.  Beets.  How could they avoid beets?  Chocolates.  And something i haven't had in years. Kasha.

Rhymes with Yasha, who has a huge personality and runs this little empire."}
{"text":"I love this store! It's very small but they carry an eclectic selection and it's a bit of a time travel to walk in and find Russian wares from candy to beer to fish to canned goods. The employees are very nice."}
{"text":"I love this place and always stop here when I'm in the area. The smoked fish, sausages, and fresh made breads here are really awesome! Try the small smoked sausages on the deli counter, they are really good. I also love the smoked sturgeon and the excellent selection of salami they have here. The Russian salami is very good, if you like salami you need to try it. If you like pickles try the pickled tomatoes they have here. They also have a nice selection of caviar."}
{"text":"Everything you need to make a traditional Russian meal! The customer service is friendly and helpful. Good meat. Offers pasties too! So good."}
{"text":"A very cool store with great cheese, meat, dairy, bakery and grocery selections. They also have many varieties of honey from local valley to Siberia."}
{"text":"The best European market in town huge place they have everything from salami to drinks to plates . Great prices and affordable . I will be back to buy fish soon."}
{"text":"I am a big time fan of the Russian honey cake and this place was a disappointment.  The cake had too much shortening added to it and the cake was really dry.  I will not buy honey cake from them again if they will cut out fresh quality ingredients to lower costs."}
{"text":"I recently went exploring this place and discovered some of the best potato salad (deli) that I've had in a very long time! Who knew Russian potato salad would rival our American classic?? 

Yasha rang up my order (yes, Yasha...the owner...from Russia...get it?) Very nice older dude. 

I got a little bit of a lot of things. Loved the lager. Loved the chocolate. The deli meats were good but if you're unsure about any, just ask for a sample. The cookies, also in deli case, were super slammin! Not a traditional cookie. These were rolled and filled w/ dried fruit or chocolate.  Yummmy!"}
{"text":"This is basically a large specialty market. It mainly carries Russian items but I also saw a lot of Moldavian, Armenian, Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Georgian items. 

This market has a hell of a lot to offer from boxes of chocolate to specialty beer to dried meats, a variety of cheeses, teas, coffees, honey, jam, cookies, liquors, you name it, I even saw toothpaste and medicine. 

I was glad to have found this place. I intend on trying the wide beer selection of dark malts as well as some of the ice cream and chocolates. 

In addition to carrying most everything, they have some traditional pieces in the back, for your own home. Lovely store! I was even greeted in Russian right when I entered! 

Which reminds me of the wonderful service. I always had someone asking if I needed help looking for something or if I was doing okay. :)"}
{"text":"This is a rather sizable store as ethnic specialty stores go; don't be deceived by how it looks from the storefront. There is a good selection of sausages and other cured meats, cheeses, refrigerated food items, beverages, dessert items, candies, and other grocery items too varied to mention here - look at the pictures I posted for a sampling of what the store has to offer. While most items here are Russian, there is also a lot of foods and beverages from other European countries such as Poland and the Baltic states. You can also come here for lunch from Monday to Friday  to try borscht, dumplings (pelmeni and vareneki), blintzes, and different kinds of sandwiches. I find the prices to be quite good, too, for the quality of the food and other merchandise they offer."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Eastern European markets & delis, so visiting Yasha was a treat for me. They have lots of interesting items from that part of the world - I spent an hour just browsing! 
It's a Russian market, and it looks like and feels like one, so let's just leave it at that. 
I recommend their meats, cheeses, crackers, and juices. They also have an excellent selection of foreign beers. We stocked up on our last visit - $50 was 4 full bags of groceries.

But, the point of my review and the 4 stars is:  they sell Hungarian Pick salami, which is hands down the best salami in the world. You'll never want to eat the 'other' kind once you taste Pick's Winter selection. It is a divine delicacy.  And it's $15/lb.  A bit pricey, but for me, a lover of deli meats, this is worth it. 

So as long as I can go to Yasha's and get that amazing Hungarian salami... two very enthusiastic thumbs up. I can't stress enough how good this salami is!

I also bought a box of Vita peach juice, and it is very delicious and rich, along with a bag of poppy seed mini bagels (they look like pretzels but they're really tiny crunchy bagels). So good! 

Staff was very friendly (they were pretty busy when we were there) and if  you want to know something about a meat or cheese, just ask! They also give you samples of everything before they slice it, just to make sure you want it. That's a nice touch. Since I already knew what I wanted, getting extra samples of that salami was icing on the cake lol."}
{"text":"Their selection is OK, it's not great & definitely not outstanding. Forget about real Russian caviar, it's not sold here. If you can be satisfied with salmon caviar or black farmed caviar, then yes, they do sell it, but you won't find Sevruga or Osetra Malossol from Caspian sea here... If you compare this store to one of the Russian stores in Brooklyn (mecca of Russian stores), it will fail in comparison, but if you live in Phoenix area and want to visit a decent Eastern-European store, then this is it. I don't think there are better Russian stores in this area anyway.

Be careful though, as everywhere else, check the expiration date. I found several expired goods in this store. Btw, if the item was produced in Russia, don't forget that they use a different system there -date first, then a month. E.g 03.07.09 means July 3, 2009. Also, quite often they stamp the date when the item was made instead of the expiration date, so it's pretty confusing if you can't read in Russian."}
{"text":"Make sure Check expiration date .If they telling you it's Russian way to read-  date, month and year , it's wrong , I did compare few boxes , it's same as in USA month, date , year .They also cover expiration dates with paper strip and new dates., I end up buying all this product and discovered later .
By the way thanks for letting me know that salami I did not buy, you end up throwing away, it must been very-very  old .

Its not a way to build a business . 

As a owner you can't blame stuff for mistakes , you fix it .
If they new -train them until they are ready to assist clients .Find an excuse not a good option , you can loose clients this way .


Since previous owner gone huge change in  dinamics of the store , it's just not the same anymore ."}
{"text":"This place has such a nice selection of salami that I would go back just for that!  My husband enjoys the great prices on the variety of Eastern European beers they have.   Be sure to check out the various dumplings they have in the frozen section, we really enjoy these and they taste very fresh."}
{"text":"* I decided to give 4 3/4 stars instead of 5, simply because I'm Polish, and would have liked a little more of a selection of Polish food items. Then again, I'm from Chicago, and spoiled as far as delis are concerned. However, onto the review!
  We usually come here with our little boy, and before Mr Yasha died , he would ALWAYS give him a lollipop or a chocolate or something sweet. He was a very kind man, and no doubt, sorely missed.
  Now, his son usually rings us up, and he's a cool guy as well.
 I must stress, that their assortment of meats, smoked fish, and deli items such as salads, is amazing, and always fresh! I have never encountered anything of sub par quality, freshness taste wise here. Sure, there might be a few \"strange\" items according to the typical American[who will never understand the eastern european obsession with herring], but to a Slav like me, it is heaven. Their herring salad[aka \"Sledz pod pierzynka\"-herring under a blanket], is JUST like my Grandma's.OMG so good.
 Their breads are the bomb too, as well as their delicately brine flavored, crisp, crunchy, garlicky, dilly new pickles fresh from the bucket.
 Now, my mouth is watering-I foresee a trip to Yasha's very soon!"}
{"text":"Yasha's is a fun place to explore.  I was able to find some of the classic East European and Russian foods that I enjoyed throughout my life.  The smoke fish is quite a find including salmon, white fish and even sturgeon.  They do have salmon caviar, but only on occasion can you find Persian caviar from the Caspian Sea.

They also have a bakery and meats worth noting.  

The store also stocks some middle eastern cousine and holiday foods.

Try some of the home made salads for a treat."}
{"text":"I love this place! I try and come here every time I am in the area. They have friendly staff to help guild you and they have the best European and Russian food in town! They have a large selection of cheeses and on the go side dishes that make dinner easy."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as Russian groceries in other cities.  Some bakery items are stale depending on turnover. Vegetables are hit or miss,  But some items worth the trip. Husband and wife owners could be friendlier. Speaking in Russian helps."}
{"text":"I love Yasha!

Ok, yeah, it doesn't have the same stuff (like produce) that a regular grocery store has, but it has so much other cool, interesting stuff, you should pop in sometime and explore! They have a bunch of deli stuff I really want to try... soon... soon...

...And don't forget about Yasha!  My friend and I walk in, slowly taking in the scene, wandering around picking up some fennel tea (turned out to be good!), some hazelnut chocolate crispy treats (we picked it out because of the funny picture of the squirrel on the box, but it turned out to also be tasty!), and then wandered aimlessly a bit more when Yasha himself comes up to us and takes over.

Picking up a basket he jovially directs us around the store, asking us what we like, showing us to the frozen foods, the breads, the wines- everywhere! He dubs us with his own names (I forget my friend's name, but I am now Mishka) and he asks us where we're from. When we say 'from here!' he says \"No! You cannot be from here! Girls from Phoenix, they are dark, like me, see! You are *Russian* girls!\"  I wish we had more time to be chatted up by Yasha, because it was great fun.

If you like tea, check out their awesomely beautiful tea set on display, and if you like toys, they have some great little tchotchkes  behind the register (I covet the off-model Simpsons Nesting Dolls still... my birthday is coming up soon, folks!).  Yasha makes a nice loaf of bread, and a fun little store to visit. Mishka says drop in!"}
{"text":"I came here based on some Yelp reviews and need for Russian and Baltic beers not often found in USA. I am impressed as they have beer from Georgia, Armenia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Germany, Ukraine, Czech, Russia Republic, Croatia and Lithuania. Of course for non beer enthusiast there is Kvas(Wheat Drink) Unique sodas, sweets, chocolates, meats and fish. Very interesting wall of money to be seen as the family came from Uzbekistan that owns this awesome place! If you feel like getting something unique you should come here!!! Very good prices and service."}
{"text":"Went here with my Russian in laws. It got there stamp of approval as well as mine. Great selection of meat, fish, canned foods, frozen items, and alcohol. Not to be missed for the slavic food enthusiast."}
{"text":"My wife went shopping there and among various items, it included Napoleon cake and Russian mustard. One just tasted horrible and the other made me sick:

1) Napoleon cake: never ate such dried out, old cake in my life. Way overpriced. Tasted horrible. Worst cake I ever had.

2) Russian mustard: made me sick. Removed the price tag and noticed that it expired in 10/12 and they sold it in 9/15. 

Called AZ department of health and they said unfortunately there is nothing they can do if a supermarket sells expired stuff. 

So if you go there, better check if things are fresh or if you get some 3 year expired stuff that has been sitting on the shelf forever and they cover it up with putting the price tag over the expiration date.

Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Yes Yasha does import great Russian food, however the horrible attitude you get from the owner makes you think twice about going to the store. If this was NY or LA he would be long out of business but due to the limited options in Phoenix he thinks he can get away with treating his long time customers like crap. Being Russian I have long come to understand the curt and non-friend behavior of other Russian's but Yasha is all together rude. He belittles and embarrasses his customers, and has his son participate in this behavior as well. If you want great Russian food with out all the b.s head down to the store on 12th street."}
{"text":"Yasha is my hero.... 

Thank you Yasha, for importing all the foods i call \"grandma foods.\" 

You can find more different kinds of Kasha here than imaginable. They have a huge assortment of dried and canned imported food. Yasha has a bakery area that has traditional Russian, Ukrainian and Polish breads. They carry wine, cooking oils, and even a section of middle eastern imports. 

My favorite sections of the store include the deli counter at the center of the store where you can find specialty baked goods, meats and sausages, salads, and other unique items. On my last trip there, I bought some Halvah, some beet and potato salad, and a piece of Russian candied fruit stollen that i rarely see in any market. 

My other favorite section is the freezer and refrigerated section. They keep frozen blini, blintzes of all kinds, imported cheeses, butter, cakes and dinner items. 

The star of the show is Yasha. He's quite a character. 

Don't be fooled.... there is PLENTY of parking in back."}
{"text":"I love love love this store!!! I go there whenever I feel kind of homesick (I grew up in Latvia) or when I want to get some Russian marinaded but not too salty pickles, just like my grandma used to make!

Great selection of all kind of Russian and European beers! I always have something special to bring when I go to an American party ;)

lots of Russian candy, sausages, pelmeni etc.
the only reason I give 4 stars, because it's hit and miss, sometimes they don't have some things, or black bread is not very fresh...
but what can one expect, it's highly specialized grocery store, it's not like tons of Russians live here and go there every day.

Overall I highly recommend it to anybody, if you are not brave enough to try Russian food, at least you can try Russian beer or some Moldovian or Georgian wine ;)

But semi-salted pickles are the best! mmmmmm I'm drooling just thinking about them :-p~"}
{"text":"As original russian I used to love syrniki ( cheese pancake) traditional russian food. So today I bought some from this store. What I got was clump of  flower doe and few specks of cottage cheese. I just had to take picture of that shame , not even mention outrageous price for them. Is owners even try what they sell? Absolutely disgusting , if u looking for russian food stay away from that place."}
{"text":"Yasha from Russia is truly from Russia. Better still, virtually all the food that they carry is from Russia or the Baltic area as well.

We stopped by to look at the store, and ended up spending $75 on some excellent foods. Of note, ask for a sample of almost anything and they will happily comply. 

We started at the meat case. I'm not sure when I have last seen such a huge assortment of sausages, bologna's, salami's, and items that I don't even know the name of. We purchased some excellent polish salami, along with a sampling of other meats. They even carry Lardo, which is almost impossible to find. I sampled it both normally seasoned and seasoned with Hungarian Paprika. The piece seasoned with the paprika was much too strong for me, but the normally seasoned Lardo just tasted of porcine bliss as it melted on my tongue. To be sure, one would not want to eat large quantities of this but a small square of it thin sliced and melting on a warm piece of toast was thought of in heaven.

Next we turned our attention to the pastry case. I was fairly sure companion was going to lose her mind looking at and tasting all the different cakes and pastries. We ended up purchasing 4 different items from the case. I was surprised and the relatively inexpensive prices of the cakes, which, by the way are made on the premises.

A stop by the freezer section loaded our cart with pierogi and pelmeni in assorted flavors were also available at reasonable prices and in assorted quantities. If you did not want it pre-packaged, it was also available loose in a different freezer where you could pick your own.

In the liquor section I found a bottle of Wild Strawberry Wine. If you have never eaten a wild strawberry you have missed one of the wonders of gastronomic life. The flavor of them is far more pronounced than domestic strawberries. I can't wait to open  the bottle and have a taste.

Yet another section of the store had pickles and pickled sour green tomatoes. If you came from back east, you used to see these items in big barrels in deli stores. Here, because of food laws they have to keep them in plastic buckets under refrigeration, but you are free to serve yourself and pick the pickle you like!

They have a small quantity of wild mushroom both frozen and dried in stock. I asked about Black Russian Mushrooms (a fabulous delicacy), and they assured me that they will try to get them for me and will call me when they do.

In going through the store and interacting with the people I found that they would do almost anything to try to please a customer.

I definitely have found a new place to do shopping. 4 stars"}
{"text":"Great selection of Eastern European foods.  Great selection of wines,  cheeses,  Deli meats and smoked fish.  Lots of homemade pastries,  sweets and freshly made rye bread.  Gotta go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"After reading an article in the paper about finding Russian food in Phoenix during the Olympics, I had to visit the place. It turned out to be an excellent decision. 2 of my friends and I made the drive after a round of Disc Golf. We were hoping for a place that might offer sandwiches like many deli, but this is basically a grocery store with a wonderful meat and bakery counter. 
     We grabbed some 9 and 12 percent Russian beer for $2.49 each. WOW!  Some Gaiser's Fine Mother Goose, Pork, Chicken Liver, Veal spread that is out of this world good. A variety of baked cookies that I didn't share. Landsjager that was good, but had bigger pieces of fat in it that I prefer. It was tasty. I had a hard time walking out without purchasing more items, but decided to come back again in the future and wanted a reason to make the drive north.
     If you get the chance to go, you'll be very happy when you leave.

     They could make a killing with a good sandwich maker there!"}
{"text":"Perfect place ))) Great people!!!!!! Variety of food!! And all around I'd say 10/10 spot for Russian food!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Im not sure why it took us so long to discover it, but we'll definitely be back! Lots of unique & delicious items. Tons of beers that I've never seen anywhere else, beautiful cakes, a deli, fresh bread, lots of chocolates and unique goodies. Prices were totally reasonable for a small, independent, family-owned shop."}
{"text":"Awesome store, the owner is really friendly too. A great place to buy authentic Russian food. I drive almost 40 minutes just to buy their bread if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"Great place to explore and try new things. Also good place to find bulk pickles and pickled green tomatoes. I definitely plan to return. Huge parking lot in back. Enters in back. STAFF VERY ANXIOUS TO LET YOU TASTE NEW THINGS!!"}
{"text":"They may have some European import foods you don't usually see in a store. A larger assortment than a typical family owned little Polish or German butcher / store. About average prices but you get to have a benefit of buying a lot of stuff in one place.

I buy from them whenever I am in the area. I never had a problem with quality of food."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a high rating because honestly they deserve it. I don't know of any other store in the valley that sells Russian food aside from Asiana Market, but they're mostly Asian. Remember it's not EASY to have ethnic Russia food in the fricken desert people! Obviously the prices will be a bit more since the owners have to pay for shipping from across the world! It's common sense guys! I will not buy pelmeni from them though because the dough just fell apart in the boiling process. I know how to cook and boil pelmeni ok, I was born in Russia. The consistency of them is a disaster. 

I would recommend going to Asiana market and buying their pelmeni, they're so much better. Good luck finding them though at Asiana, since they have so much stuff there, haha. Last time I saw Pelmeni at Asiana they were in the freezer section on the end cap of the aisle. Back to Yasha's.. the candy selection is decent here, but be careful with the brand, sometimes I feel like they're the off brands and not the actual brand, which may or may not taste differently. 

The parking is in the back and the road is bumpy to exist, but it is totally a nostalgic feeling that I miss so much. I drive 45min just to buy some stuff from here, good thing they're in the middle of the valley! Stay in business please! I will always tell folks about you to help as much as I can. I've given your name to 6 folks already. :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly, they helped me out with everything and all of my questions! Great selection, they have tons of stuff! Do yourself a favor, stop in and buy a bunch of stuff, especially if you've never had a Russian experience. They've got a great variety of cured, deli and sliced meats, as well as fresh European confections and daily staples."}
{"text":"Prices at Yasha are average for most items, and although some products are priced somewhat high, yasha's prices are nowhere near to the multiple german stores in Phoenix. It is the largest, family run, eastern european store I ever came upon in the US. Yasha carries large beer selection, some wine, lots of sweets including frozen or fresh cakes and poppy seed rolls which are hard to come by and are sometimes sold out. Deli has decent variety of cheese and ham but also smoked mackerel. Bread is awesome, they also sell some traditional herbs and teas. Yasha's is mine  No 1 Store to buy quality european groceries"}
{"text":"I came here during the end of July while visiting my brother. The cashier was super friendly.  He even let me practice my Russian on him. My family and I bought four different cheeses and with some sausage. The old Kiev one was delicious. I'll be back for Thanksgiving weekend!"}
{"text":"This is place has various Russian and European products.  It is okay.  I still miss the Russian/Eastern European markets in Chicago that I would frequent prior to relocating to Arizona."}
{"text":"This store has an extensive collection of things I do not want, and none of the things I was hoping for when I came here. What I did end up buying turned out to be the worst version of said item I have ever tasted. There are no freshly made deli foods of any kind. Quite a bummer of a place unless you are looking for something canned, or from a box. Then they have you covered. They also have a pretty good selection of candies."}
{"text":"If you are from the FSU or FSU Jewish, this is the store for you and your staples.  Good selection of food from home for those yearning a taste"}
