{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner during my visit to Cleveland because several friends of hers have recommended it.  Sounds good.

However, from the minute we walked in, our waiter made us feel like an imposition.  The service itself wasn't too bad until the end, but his attitude made me feel like I was an over-staying guest who smelled bad.  I never, ever want to come back or recommend it to anyone else.

The food itself was excellent.  No complaints there.  It's a little pricey for what you get, but it's kind of a tourist-y area, so it's almost expected to be more expensive than it should be.  

Now here comes the truly bad part.  When it came time to get our check, the waiter refused to split the check by person - he would only split a single check on two cards.  It made it a bit of a hassle for me and my friend, but we were able to work it out.  When he finally brought the (single) check,  the waiter had made a mistake on an entree price.  (It's all handwritten, not using a point-of-sale system.)  He had overcharged by about 30%.  I mentioned it to him and he got really defensive.  He stormed off to write us a new bill.  It totally freaked my friend out because she's non-confrontational and I have to admit that I was very put off by the whole thing.

He finally re-wrote the check and brought it to our table.  He paid lip service to an apology, but he made no effort to actually sound or act sorry.  No other reviews have mentioned being over-charged, so I'm hoping it's a simple mistake.  But be sure to double check your bill.

Overall, a terrible experience for some actually pretty good food.

Advice?  Sit at the bar.  The bar guys seemed like really cool guys and super friendly while this waiter was definitely not.  I have no idea why he's in the service industry because service is not his forte.

Final verdict: two stars only because the food was good.  Otherwise, one star.  Period."}
{"text":"Only had dessert entres looked good. Nice ambiance. Will definitely return for a full course"}
{"text":"The food is good, and the ambience is nice. But way over priced! $15 for 8 raviolis? Come one. We are in Cleveland Ohio!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the suggestions by the waiter were spot on.  The only reason I say three stars rather than four is the price.  A bit expensive for the style of Italian cuisine.  The fish special, halibut, was delicious."}
{"text":"I I have been to etna over and over and have never been disappointed. Eli, Carlo and chef peppe are extremely courteous and professional. Not to mention the food is authentic as being in Italy. If you want a good authentic Italian meal you must try this place"}
{"text":"We ordered three meals - scallopina al funghi (veal), gnocchi all normanna, and black spaghetti alla scampi. The veal and mushroom in a light cream sauce is very good; the spaghetti w/ shrimp and cherry tomatoes was excellent, just very flavorful. As one other reviewer mentioned, the gnocchi was nothing special. Did not have that \"pillowy\" texture, more like a pasta. Their tomato sauce is very good, but there was hardly any eggplant in the dish. The eggplant that was there was in thin slivers, not the chunks I'm used to getting. Really couldn't taste the eggplant in the dish. Overall, this is a good restaurant and I'll be making my way through their menu. Oh yeah, menu prices are not what's posted on their website. They have an older menu posted."}
{"text":"Excellent intimate restaurant in the heart of Cleveland's Little Italy. The calamari antipasto was to kill for - perhaps the best I've ever had. The Squid Ink Pasta was superb as was the Veal Scaloppini. The tortellini was fresh with a perfect balance of pasta and sausage. This place rocks. A nice Valpollacella to compliment, good service and fresh bread equals 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh, subtle flavors, attentive service but not obtrusive.... Patio seating offered a view of traffic and passers-by but pleasant and not noisy.    We loved this place."}
{"text":"I grew up in a Sicilian family, lived in Italy for years, and love to cook. So if I am going to an Italian restaurant I have high expectations. Etna blew them all away. The tender grilled octopus, perfectly prepared mussels, and the squid ink pasta are all fantastic. Tonight I had the orecchiette with escarole and sausage and in one bite it brought back so many memories of Sunday dinners with family and friends. It also reminds you that the best dishes feature a few humble ingredients prepared simply from the heart. If you have a sweet tooth, save room!!! Lemon cassata just like Nonna made, and frozen desserts straight from Milan are there to make you swoon at the first bite. 
Buonissimo!!"}
{"text":"I ate here with friends on a Thursday night. We did not have reservations, but we were seated right away. The restaurant is very small, and it quickly became packed! It seemed they only had one waiter working and two staff who were responsible for drinks and clearing plates. We did not wait too long for our food or drinks, but it felt like we waited forever for our bill after we requested it. I ordered a house salad that had just enough dressing. The tomatoes were so fresh they were a beautiful bright red color. It was a delicious salad. I also ordered the veal it was so tender and came with potatoes and peas. Very tasty! As a nice treat our server brought us a complimentary tiramisu. It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is a delightful little place! The food is excellent - definitely get the calamari. This is a perfect place for a relaxed, unrushed dining experience. We didn't have reservations so they took our number and called us when they had an opening (about 30 minutes, which I learned later was a miracle). We sat at the bar, surrounded by regulars, and got to see the staff in action. Classic, unrushed, charming conversations all evening long. It's definitely a different pace than many restaurants that prize immediacy, but the servers are competent, confident, and always in motion. You'll be glad you took the time to just be present. 

Definitely call for reservations."}
{"text":"We waited until we lived next to Etna for two whole years before trying it out...and now I'm wondering why we did! The chef is Italian and the food is  authentic. I had tortellini in a meat sauce which was actually more like meat with sauce. (That's definitely a good thing!) Overall, the food is okay; I don't feel like I have been made a regular. The prices are a bit high for the mediocrity that we were met with on our plates. 

The only thing that's a little weird about this place are the hours. I'm never sure when they will be open, but that seems to be the way a lot of Little Italy is. 
Our server was pretty fantastic as far as the whole recitation goes. He must have a steel trap of a memory to have all of those specials nailed. They were just hard to remember when he was done...I felt like I should have taken notes."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Loved the atmosphere. It was a perfect combination of family style with a glamorous presentation. We had the risotto and it was amazing. The calamari is a most! The tiramisu was delicious (it's home made!)"}
{"text":"We visited Cleveland to see the Art Museum.  Little Italy is just around the corner.  We ate at Etna the first night there and went back for the second.  Little disappointed.  An amazing wine list for a place this small, including a huge number of bottles by the glass.  Not to mention the food was extravagantly good.  The other places seemed to have menus that specialized in deep-fat fried or lots of cheese.  This one appeared lighter.  Still, I'd have approved of less olive oil in, well, everything, given my fat restricted diet.  Nevertheless, I ate it all both nights.  Three hours for our meal at the bar the first night, an hour and a half for a lighter meal at a reserved table the second.  The second night I asked for less dressing and they accommodated.  Free desert (not that I could eat it, but my wife enjoyed it.)

If you can get a table, go.  If they'll reserve a place at the bar, go.  Otherwise, be fair, and try the others.  I can't see how they'd be able to beat this place, not with the heavy cheese on their menus."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian in NE Ohio.  Charming little spot.  Peppe, the chef/owner hand prepares everything in his tiny kitchen.  Friendly efficient staff.
A star above all the other restaurants in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Really wonderful experience! Late night reservation for a large group and everything was fantastic! Great food, good service, interesting Italian wine selections too!"}
{"text":"All around very very good. Pasta excellant. Service excellant. Bread excellant. Excellant homemade tiramisu. Small quaint authentic italian atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Good portions, not oversized, but enough for most appetites."}
{"text":"Ok, this place will actually get a review from me. I am stingy with the amount of reviews I write. The place really has to deserve it in my opinion. 

The service was impeccable. I know that many small restaurant servers don't like taking a single top. Not a lot of money to be made with one person. But my server was very professional, attentive and kind. Very pleasant demeanor.

 The tortellini melted in my mouth and it was the most flavorful I've ever had. It was so fresh.

Then, I asked for the bill and the waiter brought me this Tiramisu on the house!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! I had a pasta dish with a goat cheese sauce that I can't stop thinking about! The wine was good and our waiter was helpful in choosing a good pairing.  Because we waited so long for a table (our fault for not making a reservation on a Saturday), they gave us free desert which delicious.  Topped it all off with limoncello that was perfect.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"An excellent meal all around.  We came late on a sunday night, so it was just us and another table, and some regulars at the bar.  The waiter was very knowledgable and gave us excellent service from start to finish.  He did a great job making reccomendations and describing certain dishes to us, and provided seamless service. The food was great too - we had a variety of pastas and all were fresh, authentic, and delicious.  At the end of the meal the Chef greeted us and asked us how our meal was, which I appreciated.

I would definitely come back here and reccomend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"My dinner companion recommended Etna last evening as a late night spot to attend after a concert at Severance Hall.  We ventured inside this corner comfy homestyle Italian eatery just a few minutes before before 11 pm and were greeted warmly by our host Carlo who recommended a few dishes and a sparkling Muscato from Sardegna, Italy: Dolci Note (Translated Sweet Notes)

We were served a delectable appetizer of Calamari tubes grilled on arugula.  The Calamari was the finest I've ever tried; it was so tender it practically melted upon a salad of large arugala leaves laced with extra virgin olive oil and meyer lemon juice locally procured from Sirna and sons distributors. 
Our main courses were brought out presently: a Cioppino (prepared with clams, mussels shrimp calamari and braised salmon with with homemade tomato sauce and Chardonnay from Venezia Giulia.) and a  
Black ink spaghetti (imported from Salerno, Italy) made with cherry tomatoes, fresh shrimp and
scampi.  
Chef/proprietor Peppe Pilumeli is originally from Catania (Sicily); he opened Etna six years ago this April and credits his success in due part to the influence of his brother-in-law Valerio Iorio -a Florentine chef.    
Our dinner was completed by a Tartufo made with gelato rolled in hazelnut nut truffles consummated in coco powder imported from  Tuscany, Italy and a homemade tiramisu an original creation made with Grand Marnier aptly named Grand Marnier Coppa Dell'eta.   The espresso machine was on the fritz so we settled for a yummy 
Limoncello Cordial."}
{"text":"Grazie per una cena  deliziosa.
Intimate dining experience with Italian charm. I went with 2 friends and between us we shared:  The Etna salad, calamari, veal limone, and the tortellini. All cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The waiter was rather cold to us, either because we're not their usual clientele of  older white folks or because we didn't order multiple bottles of wine. 

Foodwise was decent but the tiramisu is disappointing, do not recommend. How is it homemade?! Calamri appetizer was tasty, as were the mussels. Bread basket was hard and not warm though. Would not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I yelped this place before trying it out. I'll be talking about some of the food because I was kind of frustrated that a lot of places in little italy have really general statements about the place.

B-b-breaking it downnnnnnn:

1. Service was absolutely delightful. There was one person out on the floor (two as we were about to leave), who also occasionally stepped behind the bar as well to make ordered drinks, but he was super attentive. The restaurant isn't big, so I guess he was able to handle everyone, despite it being a full house. My boyfriend and I only had a glass of wine each; but when I looked over my shoulder, I could always see him refilling glasses of water and wine. He's not in your face either, which I also appreciated for my date. Excellent, excellent service with the best recommendations.

2. Ambiance was nice; a little on the dark side for my liking because I'm a foodie who likes taking pictures of my food. Oh well. Cute little tealights make this place a toasty, cuddly type of place--perfect for me and my boyfriend's last date during my Cleveland visit. 

3. The mister and I had a lot of food here. There was a mussel special going on. Oh my god. Absolutely delicious. These had such a nice punch, and you could tell that the mussels were fresh. They were cleaned properly (which surprisingly, not many restaurants are able to do), and I don't think the mister and I ever wolfed down food so fast. You know the bread they give you at the start? Don't even bother with trying to eat that with butter. Dip it into the sauce that comes with these mussels; they're so flavorful, and seriously, I can just eat that all day. The tomato's are super ripe and the sauce is really flavorful. I think I liked our appetizer a lot more than my entree...

My boyfriend had the tortellini emiliani. He really likes tortellini! They're very generous with the amount of meat in the meat sauce, so, if you're a meat lover; this dish is for you. I tried a bite of his food--the beef is seasoned and is really flavorful. However, I think you have to be a meat lover or an herb-fiend if you want to absolutely enjoy this dish; I found the seasoned meat a little powerful, but my boyfriend said it was really good. Then again, I'm an Asian who spends 90% of her time eating homecooked Korean food, so what do I know about Italian seasonings?

I had the Manicotti Etneo. To be honest, I asked the mister to order something that he would like trying, because I was indecisive. I cringed a bit at the tomato blend (capers and olives? Not a fan). HOWEVER, holy moly--best tomato puree in the freaking world; did not know capers, olives and tomato had that kind of match made in food heaven. You know that bread I talked about? dip...OMNOMNOM.
The actual manicotti is good too. Al dente (yum~) and the ricotta packed a nice, non-overpowering flavor. 

Dessert is just a story all of it's own. Tartufo is an absolute delight here, especially if you're a hazelnut/chocolate loving type of person. The waiter said he could eat like 4 on his own and I was like \"YEEEEEEEP.\" The cocoa that it's covered in kinda makes you want to sneeze when you eat it, but it's actually worth it.
The tiramisu was gone in a flash as well. Wish there was more of the savoiardi but I can't complain... 

Etna is definitely a place worth trying if you're trying to make up your mind. The mister and I were originally going to try Mia Bella, but we were super glad we decided on this place instead. I would not spend this much time on a review if it wasn't worth writing about!"}
{"text":"We love Etna. The best place on Mayfield. Make sure you make a reservation or you wont be dining there...."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to dining here and was really disappointed.  Everything is ala carte so it's not an inexpensive evening.  I don't mind paying good money for good food and good service, unfortunately we had neither.   3 of us ordered a special that was supposed to be a black gnocchi  with shrimp.  First of all it wasn't gnocchi it was cavatelli and could have used at least another minute in the water to get to at least al dente.  There were 3 small shrimp and some sautéed spinach in a very bland uninspired broth/sauce.  My brother in law doused his with salt and pepper just to give it some taste.  The other three dishes were acceptable but nothing special especially given the price tag.   Service was lackluster.  I don't expect fawning,  but I do expect the waiter to come by at least once to see how everything is...didn't happen.  I did finally manage to flag him down to order a second bottle of wine...it never did show up.  After it was obvious the second bottle of wine wasn't coming I flagged him down again to ask for the check....he finally seemed to get that things were not going well.  As I left I told him to do his other customers a favor and not recommend that special...He was apologetic but by then it was too late.   To be fair the waiter must have said something because the next day someone from the restaurant called my bro in law and offered a $100 gift cert to come in again.   Kudos for that"}
{"text":"Like so many street corner gems that dot the ethnic landscape of urban America, Etna is no exception to the hidden wonders of these unassuming troves of culinary delight! The interior is a dimly lit spectacle of tables closely placed, with a three-sided bar providing a fitting backdrop to this finely coordinated setup. To quote a verse from the Chuck Berry hit \"School Day \"You're lucky if you can find a seat,\" this was my experience, and lucky I was because the place was packed! Once I did a table, the owner, a nice gentleman from Roma, greeted me and took my order, I opted for the Spaghetti Alle Cozze, which was a well-portioned, delectable blend of fresh tomato sauce with steamed mussels - FANTASTIC! Some things are not worth waiting for (e.g., the Browns to win a Super Bowl, the national debt to shrink, a woman who doesn't appreciate you), but a table at Etna certainly is!"}
{"text":"Amosphere: Very nice. They dimmed the lights SO much around 9 or 10pm though that I could barely see the people that I was with! Would have been nice if I was on a date, but...I wasn't. :]

Food: Good! We were sitting by a couple who absolutely raved about the trout, so one of us ordered the trout. We were also told that all of the ravioli was going to be remarkable, so we ordered two kinds of ravioli. The trout was agreed by all 3 of us to be very good, and the ravioli, too. It just wasn't as rave-worthy as we were expecting based on those reviews! The highlight of the table was the lobster ravioli. 

Service: NOT attentive. We were served plain bread before the meal and tried to get someone's attention for quite a long time to ask for oil and vinegar or butter. 

The Sicilian owner/cook: Came around and met people. Talking to him for a minute was a highlight. Seems like the real deal.

Would I go back? Honestly, I prefer other places in Little Italy. But I wouldn't steer people away."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker while on a business trip.  This is exactly the type of Italian restaurant you should be eating at. It is tiny and cozy-- felt like sitting in my mother in-law's dining room (this is like my go-to descriptor for a good Italian place). It may have been a little too intimate for a 2 person business dinner, but I highly recommend it for a date or even with friends or family.

The staff is very highly attentive and the food was flavorful with a fair price. They also had a good selection of Italian wines with espresso available after your meal.

It's hard to find a cozy little Italian restaurant with quality food on the west coast so I was happy to have found this little gem during our visit."}
{"text":"Visited Etna while I was in Cleveland. 
It was ok at best.. nothing I would rave about.  Then again, I have to keep in mind its in Ohio. The food was mediocre..the atmosphere was ok. The waiter could have been friendlier.
Overall not my best dinner.. and I have no intention of going there again..."}
{"text":"I'm a little afraid to share my secrets here. It is already pretty crowded most nights and it's not a huge place. But alas, I feel I must. 

Sit at the bar and talk to Eli. He will tell you about today's specials. You'll want them all, but just pick one. You won't be sorry. I always stick with the specials. I have never gone wrong here. 

I nominate them for best calamari in Little Italy and maybe best in Cleveland.  Grilled not deep fried. Always on the menu. Wonderful! A must do if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This simple but delicious Grilled Calamari is a personal favorite.  Enjoy sitting at the bar and rapping with Eli, who is the reason I keep going back. Friendly and great at recommendations.  Now if they'd only bring back the Osso Bucco...."}
{"text":"Wasnt as expected. After we sat down it took maybe 10-15 minutes to get a drink order. Our server didnt seem to care enough to serve us yet wanted tables outside. We got our food and it was okay beside the grilled calamari, that was really good. As for main dishes, my mom got a squid ink pasta with shrimp and red sauce. I got tortellini with a meat sauce. Nothing to go crazy for. But our server would be the reason for never coming back."}
{"text":"Omg --- better than Italy! The best place in little Italy - cleveland. The ambience. The intimate staff. The few tables -- a piece of Italy. I felt completely spoiled sitting at the bar with Eli. A little secret... You have to walk a little down the road for this gem. Peppe -- Sicilian born is the chef. The rainbow trout - heavenly ---,was to die for!!! Special treatment. Most of the wait staff is male except for Silvia who enchants all of her customers. 
You can't go wrong --- the prices are way below the quality of the excellent experience. Don't miss out!! Meraviglioso.."}
{"text":"This is a real gem in the heart of Little Italy, and quite frankly there aren't a lot of them.
Small and intimate.  Chef is the owner and the cooking reflects his passion.  Going here is truly supporting 'Local\".   Very comfortable with a pub like feel without the emphasis on the bar.   Most of the people who eat here are 'repeats'.  That says everything you need to know.  Good wine list, good service, solid food.  Could be real busy on the weekend. Great spot for the middle of the week."}
{"text":"Having eaten there over a dozen times, by far the best food in Little Italy. The service (Eddie and Eli) is outstanding and chef Pepe continues to provide great tasting salads, apps, seafood and pasta entrees. If you haven't eaten here, you need to try it."}
{"text":"Etna is amazing. It's adorable and quaint. It can also seem very romantic without being even remotely stuffy feeling. I've been here a number of times and have always been incredibly impressed.

Etna is very small, and the space seems authentically Italian. The service has always been wonderful.

The food is always amazing! Their pasta is perfectly al dente, and their ingredients are fresh, of high quality and are used flawlessly. the servings are large and incredibly affordable. 

The have an excellent and affordable wine list as well.

I've been here with many people and have never heard a single complaint. 

I have spent time in Italy, and some of Etna's dishes are the closest I've ever had to authentic Italian. Be sure to check it out. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Was a little surprised how bad the food was. Pasta came out of a box, sauce was most likely out of a can...too much tomato paste. Icing on the cake was the rude server. Better options just down the street."}
{"text":"The Isole (I think that was the name) salad was excellent.
The gnocchi was good but not exceptional. I've had gnocchi that really impressed me before, but this gnocchi did not.
The tiramisu for dessert was highly praised by the waiter (\"made today!\") but I found it quite disappointing. There was little coffee flavor, and the whipped cream poured over the top was excessive - it seemed to smother everything else.
Service was quite attentive (5:30-7:30pm on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a single day, this place was the top recommendation from the staff at the Cleveland Art Museum.  I had the most delicious Italian meal of my life and I have traveled across Italy. Grilled calamari on arugula, orecchiette with sausage and escarole, then a cappuccino and tiramisu.  The staff was attentive and delightful.  I'll be dreaming about this meal for a long while....."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! Dined with my son and wife last night. Rude service followed by mediocre food. \"All food is imported from Italy\"....imported is simply their way of stating, nothing is fresh! Pasta out of a box, sauce seemed canned! Full court press from the waiter to sell specials and house picked wines all of which were underwhelming. We will never return to this place again. Too many other great options in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal, all from the specials. Try the ravioli with osso bucco sauce."}
{"text":"Was on \"vacation\" in Cleveland less than a month ago. Ordered the lobster ravioli, did not taste one bite of lobster. The calamari sauce was rather salty and over powering. Not the best Italian I was expecting. Staff was good though but not enough help for a busy night. Free dessert compliments of the chef was nice."}
{"text":"Yelp says Etna does not take reservations, so we don't worry about it. My wife and I walk in and request a table for two and I'm asked, \"do you have reservations?\" I say, no...host says, \"I'm sorry but we don't have anything available.\" Boo.

There's a 100 restaurants within walking distance so we just walked a block and found a table at another place with no wait and no trouble."}
{"text":"This is a tiny hole in the wall, very unassuming restaurant that serves great Italian food. We sat at the bar, the three seats to the left corner of the restaurant as recommended by one of the patrons was definitely a great spot to sit and enjoy the meal. They have three or four vegetarian entrees to choose from. The mushroom ravioli with tomato cream sauce was delicious. Great service and ambience. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Eat there regularly; never had a bad meal, in fact, every meal seems to be memorable.  It is everything a ristorante should be: cozy, friendly, great service, wonderful new dishes each visit, a feeling that you are eating the best that Italian food can be..... I must be in Italia"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last minute and can't thank Eli and Pepe enough for the great service and wonderful food. We started with the grilled calamari and it was fabulous. For dinner we had two of the nightly specials
The snapper was great flavorful delish.  I had Bucatini with pancetta. The best then we finished with tiramisu that was the best tiramisu I've ever had.  
I would recommend it to anyone who is in Cleveland and stop by to try this cozy restaurant you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was there last night and The food and service was excellent! I highly recommend the calamari appetizer. Best I ever had! All the dishes we simply amazing and perfect portion.  Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"This places just breathes Little Italy.  When you walk in the door it looks like a small mom and pop Italian family restaurant.  Pasta smells fills the air and the wait staff is yelling directions in Italian to each other.  We really enjoyed the cozy restaurant environment.  

We arrived on a Friday night around 10:15pm and the place was bustling, it ended up taking around 30 minutes to get seated, which is surprising for a restaurant after 10pm.  If you have a larger dinner party be prepared to wait for a seat as the space has limited large tables.

Started the meal with a house recommended super Tuscan, sapaio, it was very very good.  If you like an Oakier wine you will love this wine.  Ordered the grilled calamari for appetizer.  I would definitely recommend the grilled calamari.  It is not the breaded style you see every else, instead it is fresh and grilled over an oven - it is much lighter and you can actually taste the calamari.  For the main entree, I ordered the squid ink seafood pasta with the whole lobster.  Having travelled to Italy multiple times, I can say this was one of the best pastas I have had.  Perfect al dente and the sauce was flavorful.  The seafood flavor did not overpower the overall pasta - right on point.

For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu.  Very good and would recommend for hose who enjoy a creamier dessert.  

Overall a great authentic Italian dinner experience.  I would definitely recommend - especially the squid ink seafood pasta.  Only downsides was the wait for the seat and no valet at the restaurant and we had to park a few blocks away(was not that comfortable at that time at night).  Will be back!"}
{"text":"When a restaurant is busy on Sunday night with regulars, you know it is going to be delicious - and it was!  Sit at the bar with wonderful Eli, who is very busy but takes the time to explain wine and specials with love...the bread is the best we have enjoyed since arriving in Cleveland 6 months ago (and we have tried many restaurants along the way).
Grilled calamari - excellent
Ravioli - tasty and good to share
Veal dishes - nicely down
Tiramisu (complimentary or not) - the lightest we have ever enjoyed
An intimate place, so reservations are needed unless you chance the bar availability, which is tight seating so be warned.
We can't wait to return to this gem -buon appetite!"}
{"text":"It's really very average, and I think completely fits the Yelp tagline of \"meh. I've had better.\" There was nothing wrong with our meal. Service was prompt. Salad was generously proportioned and the tomatoes were pretty good for the depths of December. Ravioli of various types were decently filled and filling.

But. First, the website lists several dishes and a whole menu structure that just aren't present. Second, the sauces are a total fall-down. I cannot distinguish their red sauce from supermarket Ragu. No spice, no sense that something has been simmered for any length of time. I have no idea whether the ground meat in there is boar, beef, veal, or crumbled sausage, because it just doesn't taste of anything. Companions were similarly unimpressed by an eggplant and a tomato cream sauce. 

The ambiance is nice, it's very small and intimate but in a pleasant way. I appreciate that sort of \"old school family restaurant\" atmosphere. I just would like it to taste good too."}
{"text":"Many options in the area for Italian and I've been to most of them. The food was good but didn't knock my socks off. The staff was very friendly. The size of the dinning area was alittle small."}
{"text":"Tourist in town looking to have a bit with friends in little Italy. This was basically a love hate situation. A surly old man asked if we had a reservation at 5:00 for the empty restaurant. He responded with a sarcastic \"uh okay then\" and immediately sat us at the closest table to the door (where outside it was raining). Through the meal he was short. The food was FANTASTIC. The blonde host was so sweet. Once the regulars arrived (a little over an hour later) we were ignored and couldn't pay our check until 6:30. He seemed to be on pleasant terms with all his other tables.Finally he came over and asked if we were ready after we had asked the host multiple times for our checks. He promptly took off after we said yes but before we could ask to split it. After he dropped the check off we asked if he could split it. With a loud sigh he walked off without a word. We paid then left. I would happily give a higher rating if not for the grumpy individual."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is the ambiance. It is very cozy and quaint inside and the service was superb. Our server was very well versed on the myriad specials they were offering, a few too many in my opinion. She probably listed off 10 specials that weren't on the menu, so hard to keep track of, but still good to know about, I guess. Even though none of us ordered from the specials. 

The food here was so-so. I ordered the seafood risotto. There wasn't much risotto at all, mostly mussels. I think they had just received a shipment of mussels they were trying to get rid of because my plate was crowded with them. There were a couple of shrimp, some calamari, but no scallops, which disappointed me because the menu advertised them as part of the dish. It tasted very \"seafoody\" which one would expect with a seafood risotto but I thought there should have been more flavor overall. It wasn't very heavy, which was nice, especially the night before a big race.

I tried my friend's gnocchi with a tomato sauce and it was super bland.

In general, this was a totally fine place for dinner. Would I come back? No. Would I necessarily recommend it? Not so much, especially as we were in the little italy district with many more italian places to choose from."}
{"text":"This place was a complete disappointment. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday (my choosing) and from the minute we walked into the restaurant we felt unwelcome. From the look we got from the lady standing outside to the way we were treated by the waitstaff the whole experience was disappointing. We told them we didn't have reservations ( keep in mind there were a few empty tables) and the man that greeted us said let me see if I can fit you in. Then once he got a table for us he told us we had to be out by 7:30. We ordered the lamb shank and chicken with olives, mushrooms, and capers. The food was ok but I though it was weird that both our meals were served with peas and three halves of mini potatoes. Needles to say we were still kind of hungry when we left. I wanted tiramisu and we decided to get it here instead of walking to the bakery down the street. We told the waitress and when she brought the check to us she said it was on the house. I thought this was strange since she didn't even know it was my bday. My boyfriend paid for the bill and when he was calculating whether we were charged correctly the waiter snatched the bill of the table and told us to have a good night. When we went home we found out the reason for the tiramisu being on the house. It was nothing but 4 small lady fingers with melted foam on top of it. Clearly something that should have been thrown in the trash. The waitress warned us their tiramisu was different because they used custard but this was not custard it was whipped milk. The whole time we were there it felt like we were a bother and that we didn't belong there. This is while the other tables received excellent service. This restaurant needs to get off their high horse and learn there are plenty of other places in Cleveland to go for dinner and they need to realize that if they want to compete."}
{"text":"The bartender seemed to favor the \"regulars\" and blew off the \"non-regulars\". The waiter was great. I was surprised at the GRILLED calamari  - it was a bit tough. But the smoked salmon was great."}
{"text":"If this is authentic Italian, then apparently my hubby and I are not fans of Italian food.  I ordered the mushroom risotto and received a perfectly cooked risotto that tasted like it had been mixed with Kraft powdered cheese!  It was just weird.  My hubby had the special...a spinach ravioli with an osso bucco sauce/topping.  It was tasty, but not great.  We ordered a dessert that was similar to tiramisu with a berry topping...I was expecting some fresh berries over mascarpone and lady fingers like the menu stated...what we received was fluffy cream over a lady finger with a day old strawberry slice on top...ok, but nothing special.  The best part of the meal was the heavy pour on the wine.  The wine was a great value...everything else totally over priced.  Hubby's review?  There was a place... with food ...and service and a great wine...that's it."}
{"text":"We shared a mussels appetizer and even after that I still craved more seafood.  Had their daily special (Cioppino) and loved it.  If not for the fact that it was the daily special and i might not be able to get it again, I'd visit for often!  The stew was delicious and stocked with plenty of delicious seafood - large pieces of fish and scallops, jumbo shrimp, and plenty of clams and mussels.  It was served with equally delicious garlic bread to soak of the soup...mmmm.  The only suggestion is that they might be able to tone down the garlic in the Cioppino just a tad.  

We sat at the restaurant for a long time after dinner and no one complained.  In fact, they gave us a complimentary \"tiramisu\" dessert.  Good thing it was complimentary so I'm not letting it's poor quality contribute to the rating, but it was not good at all.  Basically a bowl of whipped cream with some shaved pieces of chocolate on top and some tiny hidden pieces cake under the cream.  I wonder if they made it up on the fly just because we were still sitting there and they wanted to give us something to nibble on?"}
{"text":"One of the best Little Italy restaurant. If you want really authentic food you need to try this place. Real italian Chef From Sicily means real italian food.
A lot of places in Little Italy are Italian-american food. At Etna you can't find Alfredo sauce. So don't even ask."}
{"text":"This is great Italian in Cleveland.  It's a very small restaurant, so make reservations.  I had the lobster ravioli with black caviar cream sauce.  One of the best things I have ever tasted.  Get a bottle of wine and enjoy your meal.  This isn't a place to go when you're trying to make a show or movie, etc.  The mussels are also wonder, some of the best bread dipping around!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in town and dined at Etna tonight with my daughter! We shared a fresh green salad and the black pasta with shrimp. It was excellent and the vibe was great. Chef Pepe has it going on! I highly recommend it. My daughter and I had a memorable night!"}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Italian food! Quaint and little restaurant with cozy seating. Prices are decent and everything is homemade. Make sure to call ahead or make a reservation because the place is small and fills up fast, even during the week. The caprese salad was amazing- the fresh basil! I had the gnocchi as an entree and you could taste how fresh they were! Very good overall!"}
