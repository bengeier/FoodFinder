{"text":"Sometimes we take the ones we love for granted. It has been too long and we order from here too often (about once every 4 months) to not review. I can't believe I have let it go this long...  We have ordered from other places in town to try different things and I can tell you with all certainty, there is no better that Airdrie Wok in this city for Chinese food.   I will keep this simple. The person who takes your order on the phone is always kind and polite, the food shows up quickly (under the amount of time promised) and it is always hot. Hot, as in, temperature hot. The food is consistent and always delicious whatever we decide to try. The prices are decent and you get a lot of value for what you pay for.   Thank you for being our 'go to', you have earned our loyalty."}
{"text":"Attended for the lunch buffet. Good selection, fresh, well stocked & good food. The environment was clean and service was friendly."}
{"text":"The buffet is pretty tasty but at $14 for supper I think it's a wee bit pricey. But maybe I'm being cheap.... The chicken mushroom dish is delicious. The rest is adequate Chinese buffet when you need a fix. I ordered the deep fried won tons recently. Don't bother. I'm a strong believer in soya sauce to make anything taste better... Yaaaa no. Didn't work. Just for kicks I weighed the contents of the won ton. 1.5 grams.  See pix. That equates to $193/lb. Not doin THAT again."}
{"text":"It's been some time I've here.  We wanted a quick lunch and not have to wait for service.  Wow they have expanded the seating and increased the buffet selection.  We arrived before lunch rush started on a Friday.  We were seated right away and made our drink selection.  Went up to the buffet all the food was fresh and looked and tasted delicious.  Well worth the stop in for lunch.   Staff are very friendly and removed our dirty dishes quickly.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow, what a let down.  Checked out reviews before heading here and was surprised that this place was getting high reviews. The staff are very friendly but the place looked \"old\".  There are approx. 8 buffet dishes and about 2 dessert items.  Food selection was stale.  Your basic wonton, sweet and sour pork, dried pork (basically pork without the sweet and sour sauce).  They did not even have chicken wings.  Taste was bland and tasted like reheated food.  I think it's time to revamp the menu."}
{"text":"Very nice lady who took my order over the phone. Food arrived on time and so delicious. Even after reading some negative reviews I decided to give it a go anyways and I'm not disappointed! Will order again :)"}
{"text":"My brother & wife celebrated their sons 8th birthday here earlier this month with family & friends.  We had a back section for a lunch buffet and birthday party.  The restaurant was clean and the server was very friendly and whisked away dirty dishes & filled drinks.  The buffet was refilled quickly with hot fresh food and everyone enjoyed the food & party.  We brought our own mini styrofoam takeout containers to send home leftover cake.  The buffet at lunch was reasonable and very tasty with various selection of ginger beef, S&S dishes , noodles , mixed veggies, fried rice , won ton soup, etc Also was a selection of dessert choices too . The won ton soup was delicious and had to be refilled several times"}
