{"text":"I recently moved here from Quebec and I was really looking for a place that does the Poutine the RIGHT way!! Which believe it or not, seems to be difficult!  I searched for quite a while and when I went to the Farmer's Market, I saw this lovely little place and decided to try out their poutine. I mean, they are called \"A Taste of Quebec\" so they must know how to make a poutine! And boy was I right!   The fries are crispy, the sauce is light yet savory (in other words : simply delicious) and the cheese curds are squeaky and stringy! The people are very pleasant and helpful. They also speak french, which I love!   J'ai vraiment adoré votre poutine! Je suis si contente de vous avoir trouvé!   If you really want to know what a poutine is suppose to taste like, make sure you stop here!!"}
{"text":"Oh squeaky cheese, how I love thee!  If you need some fresh, lovely cheese curds - this is your place.  I went to the farmers market with a friend from Montreal, he insisted on buying me a pack of the cheddar cheese curds from this shop. The curds are Armstrong curds and are brought in fresh every Thursday - so you know you are getting the goods. Brought these babies home and this package didn't last until mid week - so, so, so good.  Would have liked to make a home made poutine but...next time!  I can't really comment on anything else this booth was offering, but next time I'm at the market I will be stopping here to pick some up."}
{"text":"I went to the Calgary Farmers Market this past Sunday and was very curious about this shop as I walked by. I saw the cooler full of cheese curds and I knew right there that I had to check it out. There were so many maple syrup items that I felt more Canadian just standing in the booth. I gave into the impulse of buying a bag of curds and let me tell you - they do not disappoint. They are so creamy, cheesy and delicious.   After a full walk around we decided to go back and try the smoked corned beef sandwich and poutine. My goodness! We only ordered one combo to share and let me tell you, it was enough for the two of us. The sandwich was FULL of flavorful meat and the poutine... oh the POUTINE! You must try it, that is all I will say."}
{"text":"November Challenge - 30/30   When my cousin from DC came to visit back in October, we were hit with a snowstorm that didn't leave much else to do except keep warm inside the Farmers Market.   Luckily, she loves food as much as I do, so Calgary Farmers Market quickly became a favorite spot for hangs and finding different treasures to take home.   Taste of Quebec offers an assortment of all things Foux De Fa Fa with a CanadiEn twist: Legit squeaker curds for turning your kitchen in to your very own Poutinerie, Creton (pork spread... yeah...), Maple syrup by the jug; can; glass bottle, maple sugar, maple fudge, bière d'épinette, etc. You can easily fill up a suitcase with souvenirs in this one spot! And Claire is so friendly and charming, you just might wind up doing so.  For two suitcases. One for me, two for me..."}
{"text":"Im from montreal and I bought a Tourtière (meat pie) from here and it taste just like being back home ! Great taste if you are looking to have a taste of Montreal food I highly recommend this place. Lots of other goodies there  too I will be back there for the Fruit Ketchup and maple products and St-Hubert sauces. Great job keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"For Montrealais in Calgary like me, I find that I miss a lot of my favorite foods especially around the winter.  While there are a number of Montreal Bagel shops and smoked meat restaurants, there are some specific foods that come around only during the Maple Syrup season that we Quebecois call \"Cabane A Sucre\".  There's usually a 1 day festival organized by the local francophone community, but then what do you do for the rest of the winter (let alone the rest of the year!).  And from that comes A Taste of Quebec in the Calgary Farmer's Market. A cute little booth offering classic Quebecois Tortiére (meat pie), classic maple sugar pie, maple fudge and other maple products, spruce beer, and other types of traditional foods (not to mention smoked meat of course)... but all year round!  With the addition of this spot, the Calgary Farmers Market is a great place to be for Quebecois to recharge their batteries once a week."}
