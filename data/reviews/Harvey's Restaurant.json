{"text":"This was my first visit to a Harvey's. I was impressed with the food for what it was, however I had an upset stomach after eating here and it defiantly wasn't from anything else I had eaten."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD. I tried using an official Harvey's coupon and they won't honour it. I went to another Harvey's just down several intersections and they fully accepted it with a smile.

Keep in mind that the owner (ugly short lady with glasses) is a total jerk. She keeps an eye on the parking lot and makes sure you are truly a customer if you are parking in her poorly marked signs.  Anyway, in short... NEVER go there unless you want to be yelled at and ripped off."}
{"text":"This harveys is located in a very busy plaza and has no drive thru. There are always long line-ups and the cashier is really unfriendly.  The rest of the staff are really friendly and outgoing.  It is really clean and there is lots of seating available."}
