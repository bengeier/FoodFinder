{"text":"Service left allot to be desired, as I am in the business.  My training always included that first come, first serve.  But obviously that is bypassed when friends show up?  And this Administrative Fee that is automatically added to the bill is illegal unless it is posted.   Sorry Route 28, you won't get my money, nor my co-workers.  Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent Happy Hour with an amazing buffet!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years , new ownership a few months back and since then the bartenders that has been here for years quit and service now is horrible . Manager and other bartenders are rude only sit and talk to their friends . Drinks are weak food has gone down hill I would not recommend coming here , ever . Unless your friends with the manager or bartenders"}
{"text":"There was a Psychic fair  and wedding reception at the comfort inn today but only 16 people in the bar when we where there. Took 10 minutes to get water and menus, two of the menus by the way were not complete, only one sided not the whole menu.  Three of us placed orders. I personally watched the manager  write down our orders with all our requests. A table sat AFTER  us was served  first so most of our food came out cold. I ordered  grilled chicken salad,  extra  ranch  and no onions. I got onions and no extra  ranch. Robin ordered French dip  with sweet potato fries (which were  actually  really  good), and provolone  stix with ranch  for  dipping.  She got regular fries , cold provolone  stix and Marana  dipping sauce.   Rose ordered a Quesada with sour cream. She got no sour cream. Did I mention the food came to us cold.  When robin  asked for the manager she had left so they finally tracked down the owner. He was defensive  when  robin explained  the problems.  This has never happened  before, I didn't add extra staff cuz I didn't  expect to be busy.. I'll  just comp your bill. Not what we wanted.....and he was what do you want me to do.  Say \"im sorry for your  inferior  service\" would have been GREAT.  Not act like it was our fault  he didn't  expect to be busy and treat customers  like crap."}
{"text":"Very convenient for the hotel being attached to bar for the bar tender which is clearly more than a bartender! She then claims after \"I have a boyfriend. \"I don't think you want him to be mad then holds out her hand. Are you joking?! I told her you need to go! Freaked out!What kind of place is this? I simply thought she was interested. Now I have stuff!Brown hair girl.Stay away Food wasn't great but wasn't bad. Drinks were ok. Seemed outdated and lifeless inside. Wonder why the locals must know what really goes on!"}
{"text":"Pefectly acceptable bar food.  The karaoke and open mic gets turned up wayy to loud making it an unpleasant atmosphere at those times."}
