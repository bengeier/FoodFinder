{"text":"A group of ten of us went on a Sunday afternoon for dinner. Many in our group got the prime rib special that is only offered on Sunday. One gets a nice size steak, one side and a salad for $38.95. Those who chose it were all very satisfied. I ordered the salmon. It was excellent. Light barbecue glazed on a bed of some type of mushroom/vegetable mix. Excellent. The ambiance is that of a dark cave, perhaps, to keep you from looking at the high prices. Good to know.........one can use Outback Steak gift cards at Flemings."}
{"text":"Just went for their happy hour. The woman bartender obviously doesn't like her job. That's apparent. We had some cocktails that seemed to sweet and tasted like there was hardly any alcohol. This was the first time I had ever been there. Probably won't return. I hate going to a place where I feel like I'm imposing on the staff. Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"First of all, steaks were just OK. Everything is ala carte which is typical for this type of steakhouse. We were seated right away. They had a digital drink menu which was nice.
The manager asked me and my hubby what were we out celebrating-maybe she didn't mean anything by that, but we were just out to get a bite to eat on a Wednesday. The server gave me the wrong bill. Then boxed my take-away food up and brought it back out to me without a bag.
Just not the type of service I would expect from a place charging $100 for some of their steaks.
XO's is much better and right down the street. The service is lacking. I dine out quite a bit, and some of the most memorable experiences have been from places that have great service."}
{"text":"My family and I went there recently for an early holiday dinner with family. Food was average to good. Some things on the menu are great versus others. Having the self proclaimed top 2 percent of beef in the country, I am uncertain. Might be a toss up between longhorn, outback, and a bunch of B.S.  they have some good sides and light fare options. Service sucked and they drip feed bread out of the back to the table by the bread crumb. Overall- other yelp reviews were right on poor service and steaks.  Average food for a lot of money and next time will save 100 bucks and head to long horn for \"flo's fillet\" or May give flemings one more shot and try the bar bites before jumping into a full fledged steak smack down !"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the portions are a good size. However bring your checkbook it's very expensive."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon and would come to this chain again.   Service was fair to middling, but the filet mignon was cooked perfectly, the Fleming potatoes required an extra dose of Lipitor upon my arrival home and the parmesan/asiago butter provided with the warm bread was slather-worthy.   House salad was unremarkable as was the dessert - skip both."}
{"text":"I gave this 5 stars, which I never do. This past week was my Husband and my 33 yr Anniversary, which I told them when I made the reservations. The Manager (or Owner not sure) made sure this night was special. Our Server Jeff was fantastic he was on top of our needs throughout our time at Flemings. The entire staff over exceeded our expectations. The service and the food was flawless. My husband had the Bone in Filet and was prepared exactly how my husband asked it to be. Our server suggested the Special Chilean Sea bass, it was delicious, we enjoyed our evening , probably one of the best nights out we have had, we ear out often and never had been to Flemings other High priced steak house, we will not be
 back to them, we will go back to Flemings for sure! Thank you  for thinking of the extra details in making our night feel so special!!

{"text":"First time for us at Fleming's. No surprises or big disappointments here. Nice atmosphere, as it is not a huge place. Well appointed and comfortable. One very positive experience for me was that I tried \"Dry Aged\" beef for the first time, and it is excellent. Not for everyone (my son preferred his regular NY Strip). Aged for 21 days, this premium selection (about $5 more) had a great, unique and almost robust flavor. I'm a convert. Notes on the side dishes: The blue cheese mashed are excellent, but are also very flavorful. Heavy on the blue cheese. I liked them. Were too strong for my wife. The one small disappointment was the creamed spinach. It was very soupy. We prefer versions that are heavier on the spinach side. But again, not \"bad\".
Fairly high priced for Cleveland (even as Steak Houses go........), but they deliver."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our evening at Flemings. Great service, steaks cooked to perfection and great lively atmosphere. What more can one ask for? 

Great wine selection that we enjoyed. The server gave us great pairing tips (even though we didn't need them). 

Entire visiti from the greet while walking in to the thank you from when we were leaving. 

We will go back as we know we can always expect great service and food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Had to wait until after 730 to be seated for a 7 reservation. Service was abysmal. Had to ask several times for bread. Food was good not great. Potatoes were overlooked and asparagus was undercooked. Steaks were not that flavorful. Finally had to wait 15 min for waiter to take care of check. Won't go back again for this price point I expect better. Too many other choices in the area to risk going to Flemings again."}
{"text":"Expensive but boy is the food good, I had a fish, husband had a steak and we shared a potato dish, nothing was left by the end of the dinner. Oh and we also received free sample chocolates, yay."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The worst food I have ever been served at a nicer steakhouse. My steak had the taste of burnt liver, it was wrapped in some hideous meat. The blue cheese was rancid and unbearable.  It was so bad and salty I had to spit it out. There was supposed to be lobster on top of the steak.  it was about the size of a penny and in the saltiest Béarnaise ever  i could barely swallow it  The potatoes were nasty and disgusting. I have had better out of a box. You could get better creamed spinach at applebees. would not recommend. Never going back."}
{"text":"Meh, ambiance no big deal. Big, loud room. Service, short, abrupt and hurried. Place reminded me of a middle of the road experience, i.e. J. Alexanders or something of that type. Certainly not a dining 'experience'. Food was good...OK..certainly not worth the $$$. I'll stick with Red the Steakhouse when in the area.

Some folk in jeans, some young children, booster chair at next table. Meh, no great culinary adventure."}
{"text":"Looooove this restaurant!!  Ask for Joanie (just the most personable and sweet waitress!)   I went with my 12 yr old daughter who absolutely loved her steak! I am vegan and they totally accommodated me and I loved my meal!  Service was great, Joanie could not have been more friendly and the atmosphere is top notch."}
{"text":"Fleming's is a great place for a memorable dinner! We have been to Fleming's several times over the years and it is almost always an excellent dining experience. 

The main dining room is upbeat and full of energy. The wait staff, for the most part, bend over backwards to make sure that you have great service. The menu offers something for everyone; from vegetarians to steak lovers. The fries and their tall, curly Q shaped, wrought iron baskets, are a novelty. The complimentary bread and butter is delicious. The butter that they bring out to you (there are two different kinds) is very unique from your average butter. 

The bar area is always hopping and lively. Drinks are flowing and the food is plentiful. 

At Fleming's they really go the extra mile to make your dinner an enjoyable and memorable one. Free valet parking is available, which is a plus. 

Fleming's gets two thumbs up in my book!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a gift card that we were able to use at either Outback, Carrabba's, Fleming's, or Bonefish Grille.  We were out near Beachwood Mall and realized only Fleming's was out in this area.  This was our first time here. Our gift card was for $50.  This looks to be quite the fancy restaurant and we were hungry so we were expecting maybe some bread and oil on the table beforehand.  What came out was a bowl of chip crumbs....  Then, we were looking at the menu and the prices were quite high.  We didn't want to spend more than the gift card so we both ended up getting the \"small plate\" of shrimp and scallops.  We figured it would be a smaller portion but when it came out they didn't supply the magnifying glass for us.  The \"meal\" came out with 2 shrimps and 2 scallops for $25 with a tablespoon of grits and 2 tablespoons of spinach. We would have been better off going to any of the other 3 restaurants, getting a real meal that fills you up to where you don't have to then go home and cook dinner again for your husband, and MAYBE even have a little bit leftover on your gift card for a next time! There will be no next time at Fleming's for us. What we did eat did taste good though.  Just keep in mind you will have to drop a load of cash."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour!  Great full service dinning with well prepared food and presentation. Great staff and management and accessible accommodating General Manager!  Excellent Surf and Turf special on Monday's."}
{"text":"Some of the best steak and customer service Ive ever had. I also liked the creamed spinach. You should definitely get the 16oz New York Strip"}
{"text":"Good steak and a nice place.  Service is always pretty good.  I tend to order my steak medium and they are usually right on.  One of the better steak houses along with Hyde Park.  We go here on a special occasions."}
{"text":"One of my previously favorites. My wife's medium rare fillet came well done.  They did exchange it and the next one came seared but ice cold on the inside. They did remove it from the bill - but we will NEVER be back"}
{"text":"It you want a great meal, this is a place to go. Friendly staff and good service every time I go. It's obviously a steakhouse and you won't be disappointed. Great appetizers and sides as well. Generally when I'm there they have some type of prefix which you can get some very good value on. If you have room make sure you order the chocolate lava cake. Look forward to being back"}
{"text":"I give this place two thumbs up.  They have really good food for being part of a chain and the interior is nicely done.  They went through a rough patch for a while when managers were flying out the door faster than their filet mignon, but it seems as though they have it ironed out now.

One of the draws to this place is the bartender Anthony.  He's a little rough around the edges, but knows his wines and remembers everything about people.  When my wife was pregnant, we didn't stop in for almost 10 months and when we did, he shook our hands and asked about our favorite glasses of wine which he remembered.  Not bad for a chain.

The lamb here is probably the best in the area.  Top quality and cooked to perfection every time.  Any steak that you choose is better than you would get a Red's and less expensive.  The fish is good too, but I haven't sampled too much of it.  I'll go to a fish restaurant if I want fish.  I go to a steak restaurant to order red meat or pork.

The gratin potatoes here are not as good as at Hyde Park, but the sautéed spinach is outta control.  The asparagus is great as are most of the salads, but it is really the proteins which stand out as the stars on the menu.

The service is great in the bar area, but I would give it a 50/50 shot in the main dining room.  There's one Russian waiter who is just the pits.  He screws up everything.  Flemings has probably given out more free desserts due to his mistakes than all the other waiters combined.    A free dessert, by the way, doesn't make up for screwing up the dining experience.

One last reason to come here is that you can try almost 100 bottles by the glass.  They are not cheap, but it is nice to try wines from different areas of the world without having to throw down on an entire bottle.  Just make sure that your wine is fresh- ask them, they will tell you if it is or not.  Don't ask the Russian waiter, he doesn't know his ass from his elbow."}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  Love wearing jeans and a sport coat vs fancy...great wine and desserts.  Food is always consistent."}
{"text":"had a great dinner at Flemings The steak was done perfectly and service was excellent ask for Sean Kathy"}
{"text":"Very nice happy hour! We went on a Friday evening around 5 when the happy hour starts. They have a small bar area, which is where you need to sit to participate in the deal. It has a really intimate vibe with dimmer lighting and an upscale feel. The booths can fit four, but it's pretty tight. 
The drink choices are limited but very good. The appetizer choices are great, especially the filet mignon flatbread. But if you are looking for a full meal, you can always get the burger which is amazing and they know how to cook it correctly to the temperature that you request. 
Great Cleveland happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"March 24,2018
We had a very enjoyable meal at Flemings Saturday evening.  The service was very gracious and appropriate and Vanessa couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive. Along with our wine, she started us with a delicious sour dough bread with smoked cheddar butter and champagne flavored butter. The Cesar salad was very fresh. All just wonderful.
We ordered the filet along with scallops and everything was cooked to perfection.  Our loaded baked potato was delicious as well. Atmosphere was very warm and inviting. Andrew, the manager stopped buy our table to check on our experience.  All in all, a very nice dinner."}
{"text":"Part of me is tempted to give this place a 5 after last night... but I must resist.  The Louis the XIIIth was not the doing of the restaurant...  But it was very, very good.  

I had a bottle of Estancia 2006, Bone in Fillet, Lobster Tail, Spiced Shrimp and Creamed Corn as well as a Caesar Salad.

Each portion was tasty, and the Fillet was wondrously succulent.  Prices are still high, but last night's meal was memorable.  Especially the Louis.  :)"}
{"text":"Service is as good as it gets. I had 20 oz. rib eye steak, wife had filet mignon with crab cakes, onion rings and fries. Everything was excellent and made to perfection, we were seated immediately, and this was on a busy Saturday night at 7:00. The food and the service was beyond excellent. Price $$$$ but was worth it."}
{"text":"We came here randomly one night looking for steak. Heard the place was decent from another friend, so we decided to give it a try. Inside the restaurant has a decent classy feel, and since it was a weekday, not too many people showed up. 

To start off the night, we got appetizers and a flight of red wine (3 smaller portions). I enjoyed the flight of red wine because it gave me the option to try different wines. The waiter was also very helpful when I needed help to select my wines. Unfortunately, I don't remember the appetizer we got, but I have to say a lot of appetizers looked pretty good on their menu.

As for main course, these are definitely one of the pricier steaks I've seen. However, the quality of the steak was definitely up to par. For both my boyfriend and I, we got Bone in Ribeye and Fillet Mignon. Although I've had ribeye steak before, but this one definitely made a lasting impression on me. The portion was \"ginormous\" and the meat was definitely fatty. If you enjoy some fatty meat once in a while, this is the place to give it a try. I also tried the fillet mignon, which was very tender and delicious as well. I am very glad that the Fleming's was generous with their serving sizes, unlike some other upscale restaurants where a 30-40 dollar steak is the size of a baby's fist.

For dessert, we got the chocolate lava cake. And since it took them a while to make, we had to order it 20 minutes before we finished our main course. But oh man, this was worth the wait! The fresh and hot lava cake was just delicious. If nothing else, I'd totally go back to this place just for their lava cake next time.

For a chain restaurant, we had a great experience eating there. The service was definitely nice. Our waiter knew his food and was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a decent steak house.  Servers are very nice and attentive.  Had the filet and was delicious.  Did not get to try the wine cause this is on the east side and needed to cross the border (westside) in order to get home."}
{"text":"I've been to Flemings twice.  Once for happy hour and once for dinner.  The happy hour is great!  Good drink and food prices with lots of variety.  You can only get the happy hour in the bar area (or on the patio in good weather) and it seems to fill up quickly so get there early.  For dinner, my husband and I each had a salad (I had a wedge, he had a Caesar salad), we both had the filet mignon, and we shared the creamed spinach and mashed truffle potatoes.  Bread was also served with the meal and my husband had two beers.  Everything was delicious and the service was wonderful.  Our bill was about $230 with tip which is definitely on the very high end of what we like to pay for dinner.  Not sure if we'll go back for dinner but we'll definitely be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've had an issue with this restaurant. I normally go the the one located in Beachwood but we were in the area and figured we'll give it another try. It was just past 5pm and the weather outside was beautiful but guess what- they refused to open the patio. What's the purpose of it if you're not going to use it?! Unbelievable! Just ruined our day."}
{"text":"Our food was excellent but I am very disappointed in our service. We came for a celebratory dinner with our bank on a SLOW Tuesday evening. It didn't make difference if it was about getting our drinks or extra sauce for the table. Our service was pitiful. 

I don't usually give many one stars. I can find the positive in almost anything. I am really sorry to have to give such a poor experience on a night where it should have been easy, we had a table of 9. We had called in advance. We had a limited menu. Everything was set up to have a great dinner. It was a big failure. A horrible night of service. Get that right, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp!  I am a long time lurker, finally decided to jump in the pool!
To let you know, I do not favor pretentious or trendy restaurants - I do favor good to great service, well-prepared food, and a clean/comfortable atmosphere.  I don't think that is asking too much...in other words, I don't think that I am a high maintenance customer.

This was our first visit to Fleming's at the Eton Collection, dinner at 5pm on a Saturday night, before heading downtown for an event.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The dining room was about 1/4 full, but it filled up to near capacity by the time we left at 6:15pm.

Sean was our waiter, and was great -  he was very attentive and aware.  The general vibe was good, all different age groups.  I saw one child, probably about 9 years old, but in general I wouldn't say this is a restaurant for kids.  Most people were dressed up, but \"neat casual\" is ok.

We each had the petite filet mignon and shared a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  Sean told us that the sides are big enough for two people, and he was right - although in my own house I could have EASILY eaten all the garlic mashed potatoes myself!

The filet was very good, but when they tell you that the plates are HOT, believe it...my partner accidentally touched it a couple of minutes after being served, and it was an \"ouch\" moment.

Also - the bread was great (a detail that always makes me happy), partner really liked his french onion soup.  After reading other Yelp reviews we ordered the chocolate lava cake, which was verrrrrrry good...they serve it with a very good vanilla nice cream and with pistachios.

All in all, a very positive visit.  I don't eat a lot of steak, but the next time I am at Eton I may return and have a sandwich at the bar."}
{"text":"We went in on a Friday night expecting to sit at the bar.  The bar was packed but there were tables open.    Since there were only 2 of us, they sat us quickly.   We had great service from our waiter.   

Outstanding steak.  Really liked the Fleming Potatoes.   Plus a good bottle of Malbec. Definitely not an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Another home run!   I stopped here for Happy Hour at approx 5:30 on a Thursday night.  The bar was pretty full, with just a few single seats available.  I had come for the sweet chile calamari, but the patrons sitting a few spaces from me had the Fleming burger and onion rings, which looked very tasty, so I ordered that.   As always the bartenders are super personable and attentive.  I ordered a soft drink, which arrived with the complementary homemade potato chips (yum!).  My burger arrived shortly thereafter.   The burger was 1/3 pound, well seasoned, cooked to order (medium well), and served on a fresh brioche bun with lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and bacon.   The burger was accompanied by 2 HUGE hand breaded onion rings.  This burger was divine!!!  The onion rings were at least 5 inches in diameter, thick cut, sweet and crunchy.  The breading was seasoned very well.  This was a great happy hour meal for just $6.00!    This is one of my fave places for Happy Hour, so I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Does Cleveland have a Capital Grille or a Morton's? I am unsure.

The lobster tempura is beyond tasty. The carpaccio, the ahi tuna, the bone-in ribeye...it goes on forever at this joint. Their cocktails? It wouldn't kill them to get aggressive with the bitters.

That said, you can't complain about the booze at a place where the wine list comes on an iPad. Go here for your 10th wedding anniversary or something."}
{"text":"Go there for happy hour. Reasonably priced, good burgers, and decent drink selection. Beer selection could be better but it's what you would expect from a steakhouse."}
{"text":"After shopping, grab a drink and a smile!
After a hard day at work, grab the best Happy Hour on the East side!

Who says it's the best? I do, so that matters because I am the Happy Hour Queen!

7 days a week and offered twice, which is most of the evening!
5-7pm (actually 4p on Sunday's) and 8-10pm! 
Seriously!
Wines, beer, cocktails AND food!

Nobody does that on the east side.
The staff is Stellar so, Visit Vickie, Herman and Laurie at the Bar!
Blake, David and new addition Caitlyn are the best servers that tend to your very special needs on the floor.

I love the Braised Beef which is so tender and juicy, you can cut it with a fork.
The Spicy Shrimp is delicate, just tell them you don't need the potatoe chips sopping up your juices.
Any steak is better than RED and better priced as well!

Desserts are PHEnomenal !!! All of them, although my favorite is the fresh Bertie and whipped Chantilly cream...
Man, I gotta go, it's almost Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Huge room, with a cafeteria feeling. Major reason for this bad rating is the service!!! food was average for the price, would not stop at this location again!"}
{"text":"Our small group went to Fleming's for dinner the other night to celebrate a birthday.

Pros - The food we ordered was good.  Our server was friendly and attentive.

Cons - Bottles of wine were marked up insanely high (A $16 dollar bottle for $50+ bucks!).  Beer selection was not high quality.  Very small menu (what we did order was cooked properly).

Overall, it was an ok  meal. Not sure it was $200+ worthy, however.  Everything seems very overpriced.  Probably won't be back again.  With Red's down the street and some great new local joints opening up, we probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Suburb service!! My steak was tasty and the crab cake was excellent! The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere,great servers and the management is excellent. Sean M.,was our server for the evening he was extremely friendly and frequently checked on our table. I highly recommend Flemings, not only for the food but for the overall great dining experience."}
{"text":"This is always a no brainer when you want to eat at a great chop house.  My truth is that I never get the steak ... I love their Pork Chop and I always get the onion rings as a side.  Yes, far from calorie counting unless you are counting high!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Impressive service and amazing food. It's obvious the team is highly skilled, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Fleming's is my second favorite steakhouse after Red. The steaks here are great although could use a bit more char on the outside. The lobster tempura appetizer could not be beat, and sometimes I come here just for that. They also have chimichurri sauce, which is my favorite sauce of all time. It is no longer on the menu, but if you ask for it, they will have it. This is a steakhouse where you will actually need the valet service because it is difficult to park at Eaton a lot of times. Plus, it's also so hard to walk a long distance when you're busy digesting."}
{"text":"The food is always WONDERFUL! The steaks will melt in your mouth, the seafood has great flavor and is very fresh, the flemings potatoes are a must have, and the chocolate cake is AMAZING. The red wine Charles & Charles is perfect."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a reservation for New Years Eve at 9:30pm. We were seated at about 10pm. We expected there to be a crowd so we weren't upset. We had the calamari as an appetizer, petite filet, house potatoes, creamed spinach, and then creme brûlée for dessert. 

Everything was okay. My steak was overcooked. Potatoes were amazing! Creme brûlée wasn't fresh. I'm assuming because it was a holiday they made everything in bulk. Usually, At premier steakhouses, the creme brûlée top is still warm from the torch. 

Nonetheless, while Flemings is a notable steakhouse, the quality of the food has me ranking it well below steakhouses such as Ruth's Chris!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite retaurants. I could always count on flemings for consistent excellence and would take business clients there. We made reservations for 8 2/13/2013 to celebrate valentines day with our children and another family. We had crab legs and lobster which were very good. Salad was excellent, but the 4 filet mignons were over cooked and had a liver flavor. My sons chicken fingers and fies were almost black they were so over deep fried nd the molten lava cakes had no ooze due to being overcooked. The filets were some of he worst we had ever tasted. We did not complain, left a good tip and I phoned he following day to peak with a manager. The manager was not availble and never returned my call. It would have been nice to be given an eplnation as to why the kitchen was so off.  My husband and  I gave them another try this Friday. Food was very good along with the service."}
{"text":"excellent food. classy, lots of dark wood and wine bottle everywhere.
pricey, you pay for the steak and sides separately. this is good place to go when someone else is paying, or you are with some vegetarian friends as the sides are wonderful and not too expensive. one of the best caprese salads i've ever had, just perfect.

service is very good, very friendly, and they take reservations. there is a special three course meal for one price, definitely a wonderful and memorable meal."}
{"text":"Overall, great food and great service, but overpriced.  Food was VERY well prepared, however if I am going to spend $270 for 2 people (even if it is with tip) I want food that I cannot make at home.  We enjoyed 2 nice Flemings salads, a nice filet and full lobster tail as well as a nice seafood trio with scallops, a king crab leg and a full lobster tail with brussel sprouts as our side with 1 glass of wine and a strawberry lemonade.   Finished with a chocolate lava cake and ice cream for desert.  Each item was cooked perfectly and no, I probably cannot make the lava cake, but at that price I wanted my name in lights when I got the bill :)  But my wife loved it and although the place was packed the staff handled the crowd well!"}
{"text":"Does an upstanding job on your basic meat & potatoes (with chicken and fish available for non-carnivores), but beware the prices for wines by the glass."}
{"text":"This overpriced dinner was made worse by horrible service. They barely made it through their paces. We had to ask for condiments twice, they incidentally suggested wine and desserts and completely forgot to bring the after dinner liquor that was ordered. The restaurant was not busy and they actually seemed overstaffed. There was no explanation for the slow and reluctant service.The final straw was listening to two wait staff that were standing near us gossip about the cliental. The food was fair to good. The steaks were good but asparagus and shrimp were overcooked."}
{"text":"When a steakhouse is sending out coupons for $50 off of $100, I should have known there was an issue.  

On a Friday night the bar was almost empty, and the dining room only had 5 tables sat.  We ordered a spinach salad that was flat since the spinach was so wilted that it lost its bounce.  The seared tuna was served more cooked then raw, and the quality seemed very poor and not sashimi grade.  The pork chop were so dry I could chock on it.  For dessert we had the carrot cake, and it was dry and had a weird texture due to the canned pineapples.

Overall, the restaurant is not what I remembered it to be when it first opened.  With all of the competition, I would head to another restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars.  Knock off the horns and I will ride it home.

The good - 
Happy hour. It is kick ass!  6$ dranks. 6$ well made dranks! Dranks!!!!  You can get shitty faced for about 20 bucks or less. They have a small list of apps for around 5$ Including shrimp, calamari, and a burger. I did not order any happy hour food but what came out looked pretty good!

The bread that comes with dinner was warm and toasty. The garlic and sun dried tomato spread was superb, dahhling.

The salads- My rents got a wedge and split it. Good size. I had one myself.  It came with blue cheese,and blue cheese dressing.  The server even offered to bring us some bacon!  Of course I took the bacon!  This was a standard wedge salad. Everything was very fresh.

The Bif!
I ordered a 16 oz behemoth NY Strip. Medium rare. Steak the size of my head. It was cooked to perfection, medium rare.  The beef melted in my mouth as it should for 40+ dollars. The steak as lacking  some type of seasoning and a crust that should form on the steak. It was a great piece of  Bif just could have used that extra umphff.

The sides were nice.  The fries and onion rings were good. Nothing spectacular.  The green beans were pretty fresh but did not have much flavor.
Our server Lance was great.The service here is really good, The employees seem happy to be working here, no bitter server drama from what I could see."}
{"text":"Happy hour. Five till seven every day get a great bacon cheese burger and fries for $7, you just can't beat it. The burger is delish, the service is excellent, the ambience is great, oh and did I mention the burger...it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"The scallops and shrimp were good, 3 of each.  The scalloped potatoes were artery clogging goodness that I would happily indulge in frequently if I could ignore my conscience.  The food here is good but there are some better steakhouse in the competitive Cleveland food market.  This is good chain restaurant, but with a 75$ budget, I'd try for a more novel experience.  I still need to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant, expensive and popular.  Our party enjoyed the food and the service was good- for a lower priced \"eat and run\" place.  The servers started to remove food plates seconds after one person appeared to be finished, instead of waiting for all to finish before collecting them.  A fine restaurant, such as Fleming's purports to be,  would wait.  I personally had to rebuff 3 attempts to remove my plate.  If I wanted to eat at a \"feed 'em and street 'em\" place, I would go to a place like Yours Truly."}
{"text":"Steaks are very good here but not the level of Cincinnnati or Kansas City, but the service and food quality is so consistent that it's worth the visit. They always deliver."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for happy hour. The service was EXCELLENT, it was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is upscale casual. 

We arrived during the happy hour menu which is 5-7, and sat at the bar. The complimentary fresh cooked BBQ chips were excellent! They offer 5 cocktails, 5 wines, 5 appetizers and a burger and blue moon at special pricing. Tonight we had the calamari, the burger with shoe string fries, 2 glasses of the 14 hands cab and 3 blue moons. The tab came to $43. 

The burger was cooked perfectly to order at medium. The fries were fries. I feel at this type of place, the burger needed an acidic topping to cut the fat on the pallet, like pickle. The ketchup, which was on the side, did the job, but it was a bottled variety. At happy hour pricing of $8, it was very good. The calamari had a pepper jelly type sauce with peppers. I highly prefer this style to the Italian red sauce. It was perfectly cooked as I'd expect at this level of a place. The 14 hands was priced ok at $8, which was happy hour pricing. Regular price at $9.50 is high. I guess you're paying for the feeling that you're spending a little more to eat out. 

Worth the stop during happy hour. Outside of that, not sure if the prices accurately represent the product. Enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was excited on trying Fleming's, but I was disappointed after our experience. I recommend making a reservation because they were busy.  The parking is terrible because there's a shopping district right next to Flemings.  

Food:  I ordered the salmon...it was good, but the server did not inform me that the meals were to be shared.  My meal came with two big pieces of salmon and no sides.  Boyfriend ordered the steak and he said it was good.

We ordered sparkling water and I wish our waiter told us it would cost money.  Our server was not informative at all.  For the price of the meal I would go to another steak house for better service and food."}
{"text":"Came here on New Years Eve, our reservations were made for 645 and we were seated after 7 pm. Overall our personal experience was good but the surrounding tables were all complaining. Either about the food, service or wait time to be seated/order. As our first experience here I was not impressed with the hostess staff and reservation department. Although, I will give 5 stars to our waitress Melissa!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate as a group of 6 on a Saturday. For the most part the service was excellent. We were there celebrating a friend's birthday. FYI, they take your photo and give you a $25 gift card towards a future use when you're there for your birthday. The birthday girl got a chocolate lava cake for her birthday, but the waiter brought complimentary chocolate truffles for the rest of us, so we all didn't eat her cake. Thought that was a nice touch. Being a Prime Steakhouse, it is extremely pricey, but the food is really good."}
{"text":"I came to Flemings first never having heard of the chain admittedly, and second by necessity.  After spending nearly 8 hours in transit and only to arrive in Cleveland (no offensive) the below freezing temperature coupled by the soon to be raging snow storm, left me with a nagging desire for comfort and relaxation before the inevitable discomfort ensued.  As was so, I yelped across Flemings.

Modern décor, sophisticated wine list and like most mid-west locations, nestled snuggly in between another restaurant and the main structure containing a strip mall (to be fair, there was an apple store, so it wasn't your typical strip mall).

The time was just after 530pm, the bar sat maybe 20-25 chairs yet at that time only 5 total were being occupied.   The dining room, from what i could tell, was barely in use.  The bar tender was genuinely personable and quick to asses my level of interest in conversation from my tone (very little i'm afraid).  She made good work to cover the menu and offer slight suggestions without coming across overbearing.   Shortly thereafter, smiling, she brought me my plate.  

I must admit its not perhaps the safest bet to judge a steak house on its fish yet these grounds are all i have.  Ordering a sea scallop dish, I was hoping for something light and lemony but filling enough to hold me over for my car ride to Columbus.  Instead I was served scallops deserving of a hotter pan surface, in need of salt and a serving size unrepresentative of the $35 price i was happily paying. 

While the scallops disappointed, the food however was not a complete miss.  As a starter my friendly bartender brought warmed bread with 2 types of butters.  One infused with a cheddar cheese and the other a shallot/champagne cream.   These were both whipped for easy spreading which i eagerly applied liberally.  Pleasantly surprised, those butters lasted both in aftertaste and afterthought. 

Also, apparently there was an ex-Cleveland Browns player there which from what i gathered is a usual occurrence.  So if you enjoy good bread & butter and yucking it up with ex pro athletes then Flemings Woodmere is your place!

I would come back again, but will def try the steak next time."}
{"text":"Really good experience. It was our anniversary and everyone was so nice and accommodating. They came and took an anniversary photo of us and printed it out, and at the end of dinner they gave us a box of truffles. The steak itself was cooked to perfection. I got the wagyu beef strip. I also got the molten lava cake for desert. I recommend this place to anyone that is celebrating and wants a special experience!"}
{"text":"2/17/18 Prime bone-in ribeye steak was excellent! Very juicy and extremely tasty. Waiter said it is favorite of wait staff. The New Wedge salad was good, but had better. Needs more cheese, bacon, etc. sourdough bread was good. The Fleming's potatoes had a nice layer of baked cheese on top. Very good. Not spicy (has jalapeños). I'd like to try the Mac & cheese or roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon next time. Wife had filet, which had a good flavor, but not as tender or quite as tasty as the ribeye. Over-the-top pricy, or I would have given this 4 stars. Meal including bottle of wine and tip was about $210 for two people."}
{"text":"Ever wanted to try Flemings steak but thought it was too expensive? Or you didn't want to spend that much on a steak? If you are like me I suggest you join dine rewards - If you eat at Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Outback or Flemings. If you dine 3 times you will get $20 off at Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Outback or $40 off at Flemings on your 4th visit.

We visited Flemings for the first time ever. We were celebrating a Birthday and reserved seating online. Simple and quick and you can let them know if it's a special occasion. Since it was a special occasion they offered to take a picture of us to take home. They printed it right away, I was sad it was blurry. The picture came with a card with a hand written note as well as a gift card for $25 off our next visit! How amazing! We also got their complementary homemade truffles to take home as a gift from them. 

We both of course got steak, He got the special and I got the NY strip. I wish the steak would come with sides. Unfortunately you have to purchase sides separately and they come in shareable \"family\" size. Their mac n cheese and flemings potatoes were delicious! I recommend getting the NY strip - they will cook your steak perfectly per your preference."}
{"text":"If only my wallet was a little fatter!!  Thankfully we showed up for happy hour with a snacky appetite and thirsty palates.  

Happy hour here (even on a Saturday) had deals on wine, select apps, and burgers.  We decide to go with the wine specials and order off the happy hour menu since we were not planning on getting a $40 steak dinner plus sides.  We will save that for another day, maybe a date night.  We just wanted to blow through the $50 gift card as fast as we could.  

The bartender started us off with homemade potato chips, lightly salted, to get our thirst going.  Perfect munchies while we browsed the menu.  After a bowl of chips and 2 glasses of wine, a booth opened up in the bar area so we decided to plop a squat and order something a little more substantial.  For starters we went with the calamari and beef carpaccio.  Both were delicious and would order again in an instant.   It was enough for both to share.  Even though its happy hour, the special apps are full size.  For \"dinner\" the wife went with lamb and I ordered the French Onion soup - probably the best FOS I've had in a long time.  I can't say that it's authentic using onions only, no beef stock, but between the flavor of the soup and the cheese factor, oochie mama, daddy wants some more.  The chops were hit and miss.  Two were over cooked but the flavor was spot on.  

Each thing we ordered are described below.

TENDERLOIN CARPACCIO*
caper creole mustard sauce and red onion

SWEET CHILE CALAMARI
lightly breaded and tossed with sweet chile sauce

FRENCH ONION SOUP
baked with gruyere and parmesan cheeses

NEW ZEALAND PETITE LAMB CHOPS*
pistachio-mint pesto, \"F17\" sauce, polenta fries

I would definitely hit Flemings for happy hour again, especially knowing they run it on Saturday.  However, I think everyone has caught on since it was packed when we arrived and packed when we left.  If you want to do a little research, check out their website.  Flemings lists the items on their 5 for $6 menu but I believe the items are rotated in and out.  Another hint, take the free valet, parking can be a bitch.  Lastly, if your cheap or just like to save some cash, you can get $100 in gift cards from Costco for $80.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my dinner on Saturday as if it was my time. Our waitress was beyond courtesy, professional along with a great sense of humor. I'm sorry that I couldn't remember her name:("}
{"text":"Fleming's is a consistent place for quality food in an upscale atmosphere. I usually visit during happy hour which is 5-7 nightly in the bar. They have discounted drinks and food items during that time. I can get pretty packed in there especially on the weekends but you can put your name on a wait list for a booth or grasp your own seat at the bar. The burgers are a favorite and the drinks are unique. I wasn't keen on my Cesar salad, it was quite fishy, but that is the traditional preparation I guess. I will definitely be there again."}
{"text":"First of all I am surprised there are not more reviews on this restaurant as it was very busy when we were there.  Come on people pass the word about yelp.  Birthday Dinner with my son on Jan 19 and it was a very nice evening. Mom and son nights are special, but this was a real treat. I asked if they had a portable defibrillator when I looked at the menu as it is expensive, but my son assured me the steak was the only steak he likes and it was fantastic. Done to perfection (and I like a really good steak med rare) juicy, and very tasty. The sides were great as well, and if you like mac and cheese you have to try the chipottle mac and cheese, also the green beans with almonds are wonderful and fresh. They do take reservations but if you go early, it isn't necessary, and they have a very comfortable atmosphere. Dress, not casual. Luv it!"}
{"text":"My boss just had our company party. It was awful. I will not be back and I know a lot of other people in our party felt the same way.  There was nothing about our party that was good. The server, Mark, I believe was actually very nice and funny. Other than that --- they only wanted to give us half the room, the food was terrible. 

We started with \"cold\" appetizers: Shrimp, Some lox/cream cheese concoction, spinach and artichoke dip, a \"cheese plate\" (if you can call it that). This is where the problem began, the shrimp was not de-veined, we had to send it back after people had already been eating it. The dip was watery, the cheese plate was literally what looked like store bought cheese pieces on a tacky silver platter. There was zero substance. 

The hot appetizers were out before the guests arrived - my boss sent them back and requested they come out later once more guests arrive (From my own restaurant experience this is generally discussed when the party is booked, I don't know where lay the miscommunication). Anyway, the food was taken back and then brought back out later. Due to quality of the served food, I hope it was sitting under heat lamps for that hour and a half. I would have been embarrassed to put out that product. We had: pizza, brie balls, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, chicken kabobs, there may have been one or two more. The brie balls were basically just breading, the prosciutto was sooo overcooked and tough it was hard to eat, the chicken was BEYOND dry. They were all served \"warm\" but were basically room temperature. We were all starving so we ate them but had anyone been there to dine and been served that food it would have been sent back immediately. 

On top of that: there was no \"bartender\" in the room so all of wine for the party was siting on a table in the corner. It was 100% self serve. The food display was also abysmal -- to the point where someone came in half way through the party to make it look somewhat presentable. A little to late -- shouldn't that have been done before we got there? An overall awful experience with Fleming's. VERY disappointed and I can't wait to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely exquisite food and wonderful atmosphere! My husband and I would go back every weekend if we could! Perfect steaks and sides! Amazing bread and delicious wines! Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. Started out with the waiter saying that the order of bread for the evening was burnt so they had to start all over from scratch and there wouldn't be any available for our meal. The roasted brussels sprouts had a terrible vinegar taste to them, my sliced fillet medallions were cold. However , The mashed potatoes were good. Not likely to come back ."}
{"text":"Fleming's is really good. Period.

At my last visit, I had the mozzarella and tomato salad, sampled most of the sides (I was with a big group) like the mac 'n' cheese, asparagus, and mashed potatoes, and the prime bone-in ribeye. 

I'm not exaggerating when I say that the ribeye was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Check my reviews: I've been to all the great steak joints in Cleveland and the bone-in ribeye stands up to them all. It was oh-so-tender, cooked to perfection, and tasted great. I miss it already.

For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake, which is always my choice no matter which restaurant I'm at. Because it's a chocolate cake with melted chocolate inside and flanked by ice cream on the outside, of course it was great. How could something like that not be?

Good work, Fleming's."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with a good steak. I actually have been to Flemings a few times for work and usually have good meals. Their happy hour is excellent and service is usually great in the main dining area. This is definitely more of a business/work restaurant on weeknights and isn't too crowded on the weekend. I like the iPad drink menu and wine selection is excellent.

I thought I would have dinner here on a Friday as I received a gift card from work. My experience was not great... I wouldn't say the two stars is for any one thing, but more the entire experience. We had two different waiters at the same time, which we did not like since we felt like we were repeating ourselves over and over. They got one order wrong and didn't make it Oscar Style, no big deal, but had to go back the kitchen to fix it. Finally, there was a MAJOR issue we had with one of the entrees. I won't say what it was because mistakes happen, but it was unfortunate to say the least...

We were very nice in letting them know what the issue was, and the staff/manager were very apologetic, the chief even came out to apologize. The rest of the food/sides were excellent. That being said, they didn't comp any of our meal, which for what had happened I believe they shouldn't have charged us for the one entree with the major issue. It wasn't worth the stress, or hassle, so we didn't say anything, tipped 20%, and we left.

Update: The senior manager reached out personally to apologize. She was very genuine and understanding. As I said mistakes happen, and service was overall good. I will try again based how great the manager was when she reached out."}
{"text":"I was so ready to love Flemings and was looking forward to our special night out for weeks. However, my boyfriend and I were so disappointed that we were left flummoxed as to Flemings' (Fleming's'?) enduring popularity. 

First, cost is not everything, as we are not cheap and are always willing to pay more for special dinners out, but it's worth mentioning right off the bat: this place is expensive. Like, REALLY expensive for what it is (a chain restaurant).

The Fleming's salad I ordered was akin to salads I've gotten out of the grab and go section from Sheetz - instead of crisp greens, it was all huge chunks of the white stems of the lettuce and a lot of it was browning and bitter. 

The small medium rare steaks we ordered were overcooked (his was well done) or barely cooked (mine was blue). Our waiter was nowhere to be found and we decided to not wait for him to come around to send them back. 

The service was...not great. I'm just going to go ahead and stop reporting this dumb list of grievances because I really am not a hater. I'll just say the whole thing rubbed me the wrong way because it was too expensive a meal to be as shitty as it was. 

I hope our bad experience was a one-off and other people can enjoy their special occasions there."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying John our server was fantastic he was a 5 star server. The food on the other hand not so great. The quality of the food here is not what it used to be. I went with my wife and son on a Sunday evening around 5:30. They both ordered the Prime Rib it was just awful it was so tough it was hard to chew. The prime rib was also flavorless and I mean no seasoning at all it was the worst prime rib I ever tasted. I had two lobster tails they where good. My son said dad it's pretty bad when the mashed potatoes had lot more flavor than the prime rib lol my wife agreed. Our server John felt really bad he went and told the manager about our experience I think she really could care less never even came to talk to us about our problem. Anyway John was what made it worth our night. We probably won't be going back to this restaurant anymore. Lots of other great steaks in this town for that kind of money. I hate leaving one star but really that's all the prime rib deserves."}
{"text":"For having the most expensive filet in town ($40 for 11 ounces; $36 for 8oz.) they should be more worried about cooking it to proper temperature and selecting non fatty cuts of meat than offering a selection of white or black napkins when one is seated. That said, the service and associated aspects were top notch, everyone was friendly, and for these aspects I'd give it a 5Star. However for overcooking my meat and having a piece of it that was not chewable owing to it being fat (when it is billed as the best 2% of prime meat available) was a bit disappointing. I did go at 8pm - I am wondering if this was a 2nd shift of staff that was not the best Fleming's has to offer. Regardless though, my high expectations were not completely fulfilled. At least I got 1000 open table points. The sides are family style which is nice - the green beans were really good and had some mushrooms bits in them. 

Basically it boils down to this: Red the Steakhouse need not be worried, taking this experience into account, they remain my favourite. 

The happy hours special of some $6 items (and $9 after 7pm) seemed like a good deal - I read a brochure about it while I was here."}
{"text":"Always a holiday and happy hour favorite! Ordered the ravioli and the carpaccio and both were great. Bread and flavored butters are amazing! 

Debating on steaks, crab legs or burgers next!"}
{"text":"Called in to Fleming's tonight for a reservation for our group of 10.  We'd wanted red meat this week but were put off by Red's requirement for shirts with collars, and \"other considerations\".  Screw you, Red's.  

Seated almost immediately, our service was both knowledgeable and friendly.  Food was quite tasty - I had the peppercorn steak - was cooked absolutely perfectly, sides were tasty.  No complaints around the table.  Desert was shared, a couple of their lava cakes (ok, but not superior), a cheesecake that the eater raved about, and a nice 18-year old Macallan for me.

Mentions of service didn't come in to play here.  We were well served, friendly and confident.  One star deduction for cost - this is NOT a low cost dinner.  We dropped about $750 for our group's meal.  Regardless, I'd come back.  On the company dime, that is!"}
{"text":"Awful! Service was terrible. Food was even worse. Would not come here ever again. I'm disappointed. It's part of the outback chain so I guess I shouldn't be surprised? Sad because this place used to be good I heard."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour in the CLE ! 7 days a week 5-7. Choice of 5 cocktails 5 wines 5 appetizers all $6, or prime burger $7 or 2 seasonal beers for $6. Ain't too shabby. Love the burger so juicy like drippy and ain't cute. Only downside is kind of a small bar area so first come first serve. Bartenders are super sweet and another reason to come back."}
