{"text":"Love this place, friendly staff, nice patio, steps from the beach. LOVE the burgers. Always make a stop when I'm in the neighborhood. A+"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Great patio. Solid drink selection. Mill st beers are \"domestic\", and cheap. Wings are good, and so is the pizza. Try the chicken pesto pizza."}
{"text":"Nice little patio in the SUN. What's with all these places with patios and huge umbrellas? If I wanted to be in the shade, I would be inside.

ANYWAY, their spicy caesars are DELISH. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Have eaten there twice, worst service ever.  Staff is not attentive,  food is flavorless and cold.  I gave them a second chance but the second was just as bad as first.   
Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My favorite dish is the grilled calamari salad.  Tender and slightly charred and smokey tasting on a bed of mesclun mix and balsamic reduction - olives on the side too. Also, their chicken wings are really great and come in a billion flavors.  Try the jerk ones for a change. Everything I eat here is great, not a bad dish yet.  And the staff is very attentive.  One night I was there on jazz night until closing and we wore the poor waitress out so I had to divide an impossibly huge bill among, like, nine people which is really hard to do if you've been drinking.  I was kind of disappointed in that experience, since she got a rather handsomely tip that I feel I partially earned.  Lesson for next time is to organize this a bit better beforehand, although sometimes you can't predict when your evening will end up being long and crazy.  The jazz nights are really really fun and they have long tables and booths."}
{"text":"This is a decent bar in the Beaches. The patio is great during the summer, and inside's not bad either. Prices are ok, bit more than I'm used to (but I think that's just the Beaches in general). They had pints of Somersby available, which was a huge draw (but I think they were like $7!). I may or may not have had their food...we drank a lot and it's a bit fuzzy! 

The times I've been, the clientele was split between grizzled old men and people in their 20s. The wait staff have always been really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm really fond of this place.  Bit of an odd layout, but it isn't a problem and the patio is lovely in nice weather.  It would be great if they separated the patio into smoking and non, but what can you do.  The food is mostly standard pub fare, but very well done and quite a lot of choice.  The servers have always been friendly and prompt whenever my family has gone.  They also have a kids menu."}
{"text":"I went in on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy, but my food took a long time to arrive. I ordered the open faced steak sandwich (medium) and it was served to me well done. The mushrooms and sautéed onions didn't add to anything either. Didn't eat most of it. A mixture of not so good food and service."}
{"text":"not too sure about this place. Reviews looked good, I've seen libel music in the front window many times but hadn't stopped here until today. There are definitely better pubs in the hood. I ordered a shock top beer, no oranges in the house so I was offered a lemon instead - not exactly the same thing at all. I heard a doorbell ring 3 times from the kitchen, indicating my good was ready. It rang twice and then a third time before the server decided to take a stroll over to the kitchen. Burger arrives and apparently it is my job to put on the mayo, mustard, ketchup and relish. Included two pieces of rubbery pea meal bacon. Server seems to be more involved in her smart phone, not at all attentive to the customers. Upon finishing my meal I realize no check in to see how it tastes, again smartphone use seems to be more important. The burger was decent and I was welcomed with a smile. Everything else down hill."}
{"text":"Ehhh, it's alright.

It has no personality really, the staff don't chat much, can't remember if there is always music on but it's not usually very good anyhow.

Good patio for hungover breakfast in the summer. I've waited aaaages for my food the last 2 times though, unsure if that's a regular occurrence now. It made hangover worse. The food is pretty good, large portions, don't think there are any particularly good meals but there isn't too many bad ones. 

Yeah I'm gonna say this place okay, but I wouldn't give a fuck if I don't ever go back there. In fact, I'm tempted to give it 2 stars for the horrible atmosphere but I'll leave it like this for now. 

In retrospect, I definitely wouldn't even dream of going back if I wasn't going with the intention of eating. Then leaving promptly afterwards. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Love the staff there and the atmosphere . Food is not the best , but what do you expect , it's a pub...
The decor is contradicting , but it still delivers a sort of home-y feel. 
It's an unpretentious place where you can have a drink with your friends , while getting warm smiles from the servers."}
{"text":"What a great way to spend an afternoon celebrating my sisters birthday.  We had so much fun. Grown Men were awesome, better than ever selection of songs.  Staff at Salty Dog were really great and the crowd were all right into it.  Great memories and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent place. Great patio. **EXCELLENT** spicy caesars with pickled beans!!!  Hamburger this week was really good (and large). Fajitas last week were average. Decent service. Friendly atmosphere. Certainly worth a try if you are not expecting five star dining. Oh, the onion rings were fab too and I'll get them next time!"}
{"text":"Four ladies, four different burgers, all delicious. From a varied menu with quite a few options, I suppose we all wanted protein. Enter the variations of burgers available at this Queen East British/sports style pub, including a crunchy nacho burger! Mmmmm. Lovely fresh toppings and hot fries. We were well-served by a friendly lady in yoga pants and a hoodie. What is it with North Americans wearing sports clothes anywhere but the gym? No matter I suppose. Satisfying meal eaten on the patio on one of the last days the weather enabled us to do that in November."}
{"text":"Great local watering hole in the beaches. It is a standard bar, nothing out of the ordinary about it but I am fond of it. If your in the neighbourhood and are in a pub mood then this place won't disappoint. I have never had a bad experience here. Friendly service and good food. In the summer, the patio here is great to sit at and enjoy a drink on."}
{"text":"It's not bad. I've never actually gone early enough for the kitchen to still be open (at least I don't think) so I'm just referring to it in its capacity as a bar. Bottles and pints and mixed drinks are reasonably priced.

It's one of those bars in the beaches that feels like there's a lot of ex-Malvern kids who'll show up. I wouldn't recommend if you don't like bros for whatever reason."}
{"text":"Bounced a volleyball around at the beach and came here for a fillup! 

Seated ourselves on the patio (atmosphere is very laid back, as with most places in the area) and had a browse through the menu. I spotted that a bunch of martinis were on special today (Tuesday's, around $5.50 a pop for 2oz). Got myself a Blue Dolphin (SKYY Vodka, blue curaçao and peach schnapps). Too tart for my taste so I requested some pineapple juice to balance it out which was brought to me happily. 

But the food! The mozzarella balls are my favorite food item I've had in a while! Salad was awesome too, especially considering it was just a salad. Veggies could have been fresher (were slightly wilted). The mozzarella balls really stood out. 

Service was good, no complaints at all."}
{"text":"I really love this place!   The food is great and the ownership and staff are very friendly and inviting!   They have a great jukebox with a huge constantly updated list!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Served by Katie.
We had pulled pork poutine (not bad. Shredded cheddar instead of curds..but ok)
Linguini pescatore was nice.
I had a deluxe burger, tasty.
I'd go back."}
{"text":"During this year's annual Beaches International Jazz Festival Streetfest, I decided to try Salty Dog Bar & Grill after the group \"God Make Me Funky\" finished performing their set. After waiting for about 20 minutes, I was able to secure seating for two on their patio.

My friend and I started off by ordering a pitcher of Sangria ($18) which was very reasonably priced in comparison to many bars that offer Sangria in Toronto but definitely not as good as the Sangria offered by Futures Bakery & Cafe or say Torito in Kensington Market which are priced higher.

I order the Steak sandwich ($13) which came with your choice of fries or chef salad with the option of substituting for either sweet potato fries, a Greek salad, onion rings or a caesar salad for an additional $1. My friend order the nacho platter ($10.25) which was served with salsa and sour cream.

The steak sandwich was excellent, probably one of the better steak sandwiches I have had anywhere. I had it medium well and it was grilled correctly and it came topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms and goat cheese. What made it so good was the steak they use, it was of a higher quality, mostly like something they got from a local butcher and not your run of the mill cheap tough steak, some bars use for steak sandwiches. The sweet potato fries were also very good, nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.

The nacho platter was also very good, fresh with a fair size of tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, black olives, jalapenos, topped with green onions, lettuce and a bruschetta mix.

The service was pretty attentive and reasonably quick considering how busy they were because of the Beaches International Jazz Festival.

If your looking for a bar in the beaches area which has reasonably priced alcohol and great bar food and good service, you should definitely check out the Salty Dog Bar & Grill if your in the area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a family-friendly, pub-like, good-value, super-service, tasty-food night, then The Salty Dog Bar & Grill has to be your choice of venue. 

The service is spot-on perfection. The team of servers on staff last Saturday evening handled our table of 10 (including one baby and three toddlers) with tactical skill of a marine corps troop--only better looking and a lot more smiling.... 

Then came the food--without reservation: excellent!  

This isn't a five-star restaurant, so consider the facade when reading this review--it's a pub/family restaurant and as such, the food on offer is what you'd expect, only better. Clearly the chef and cooks know what they're doing...it's pub food kicked up a notch.

I definitely recommend The Salty Dog Bar & Grill to anyone roaming Queen St. E. in search of a fast, tasty, easy-on-the-budget meal."}
{"text":"They have a new chef and the food is amazing.  The Salty Dog is a true neighbourhood local."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, warm and fun are just some words I can use to describe this place. My wife and I were \"out on the town\" one night, checking out local places and came across this bar/restaurant. It reminds of the old rainforest cafe, or what the walls and decor would look like if you were in the Flinstones era. Natural rock like walls surround the place, making it warm. The bar itself has a long slab of stone, looking similar to marble. The bartender was incredibly personable, and relaxed, professional and friendly. She made my wife an incredible apple caramel martini, and I had the most delicious Bloody Cesar. Funny enough my wife felt like we were back in the Caribbean between the decor, atmosphere, and warm friendliness."}
{"text":"If you are under 30, from the Beaches and want to stay in the 'hood, this is really the only place to go.

The waitresses are great and pay as much attention to a group of girls as they would a group of guys (a welcome change).

Also, the food (for pub food) is excellent. Fresh and fast."}
{"text":"Randomly dropped into this bar with some out of towners. It seems like a nice neighbourhood bar. Got a table by the window. Service was good. Had a beer and don't remember what I ate. Towards the end when we had to do a diaper change and they didn't have the facilities for it, they helped us out by letting us use a booth in the back. Bonus points for helping out. I would go again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and will not be back. We were the first customers in the restaurant when it opened in the morning, yet service was painfully slow. 15 minutes to get our drinks and a full 45 minutes to get our food. And then, instead of the egg white omlette I ordered, I got a sickly looking weird brown omelette with the yellow streaking across the egg - definitely not even beaten. The server apologizes, then comes back saying they don't do egg white only. Should they not have told me that while placing the order? My partner's burger was very average, as were the semi-burnt sweet potato fries, which they advertise as a specialty.

Seriously, how long does it take to make food for your first customer? Were they trying to get the chicken to lay the egg? And how do you destroy an omelette with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes as an ingredient. Big fail. Even Whitlocks, which is utterly unimpressive, can make a decent omelette. As can I. And most people who know how to beat an egg, plop it onto a frying pan, add toppings.

The server was sweet and very new - she took my drink off the bill, apologized and said she'll pay for it because of my brunch meal disaster. I couldn't have that, so I added a hefty tip at the end to compensate. It was a good gesture and that's what the second star is for."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing here. Larry always welcomes me with a smile and a handshake. I really miss Peppery Cat (bar that closed down across the street owned by same staff member) but the Salty Dog is a great pub with a friendly staff and a big patio. The burgers were great and the wings were solid. Will be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, good food, hostile service from a miserable waitress ruined it for our party of four. We will not go back."}
