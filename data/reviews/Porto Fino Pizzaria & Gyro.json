{"text":"First and last time ordering here. Ordered large cheese pizza and a Italian hoagie. The pizza was overcooked( cheese was burnt) and crust is extremely thin with no flavor! Grocery store pizza is better! The hoagie bun was burnt, couldn't even chew, with very little meat, mostly lettuce. I called to let them know my concerns. The only response I got was, \" I'll make note of it for next time\"! No thanks! There won't be a next time!"}
{"text":"So sad to say I have ordered from this place for the last time.  I always loved their hoagies and pizza in the past, but this place has gone progressively downhill.  The pizza is so thin and the toppings are scarce now, I used to get a large pizza and the box was heavy, now it's so light!  You can tell that they have really cut down on their toppings and crust to save money.  I ordered a hoagie, and there was so little meat on it I thought it must've been a mistake, but the same thing happened next time.  Their hoagies used to be huge, now it's a tiny bun with barely anything on it.   I can't speak for any of their other products, but I've heard a lot of people complaining that this place just isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"I am from Delaware, and I was traveling to Pittsburgh. I wanted to have pizza for dinner. This is the WORST PIZZA SHOP EVER!!  The workers were rude, they didn't know how to take an order because they don't speak English. Food was terrible because the place was dirty and unsanitized.  I got sick after eating there. I will never go to this place again when I visit Pittsburgh.  Spend your money on another restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross.   We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \"steak\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest.   I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!"}
{"text":"Take a dump on my sammich and call me suzy....  Been ordering for a long time but in recent months food is on a major decline. Greasy salads with little to no meat and a surplus of iceberg lettuce ect. The straw that broke the camels back was today when i ordered a sandwich and sweet potato fries. Now the sandwich in question was deemed \"steak and ranch\" now given that their hoagie menu has no descriptions your best guessing what toppings come with the sandwich (lettuce, tomato, onion, ect) SPOILER ALERT it's onions which since it was not listed i did not assume came with the sandwich so yeah my bad. HOWEVER it does NOT come with ranch, there are no ranch elements to the sandwich not even dry flavoring. As for the fries, well they didnt exist, because the restaurant was out of fries so rather than call me back and offer a substitute i showed up ready to pay and was told they were out of SPF and \"didn't know what to do.\" i sighed took my food left the two ladies who weren't to busy to call me back and decided \"screw that place.\""}
{"text":"The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.  Rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.  The driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges.   So I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.  I would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.  Do yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town."}
{"text":"Plenty of mixed reviews, mostly negative, however I decided to give Porto Finos in Carnegie a shot.  Ordered a salad, pizza and calazone.  Over the phone, person taking order was fine, phone system or my cell made it hard to communicate and all went well, repeated order and provided total.  45 minute deliver estimate and just a hair under 45 minutes the order arrived, yes I timed them.  I thought it was a bit pricey for the order but after seeing the size and feeling the weight of the items, the price is very reasonable.  Pizza and calazone arrived hot and salad was cold.  Salad was jam packed, tons of chicken and the other typical salad goodies.  Buffalo chicken Pizza was cooked well and super tasty.  Plenty of cheese and toppings.  The calazone was amazing!  Super stuffed with great tasting ingredients and baked just right, not to crispy and not soggy.  I'm impressed and not sure why so much negativity.  Red sauce is robust tasting, not sweet, just solid.  Will order again."}
{"text":"Recommended. 16 inch pizza on special was cheap. Fast service. Not the best pizza but above average."}
{"text":"First and last time ordering from this place, pizza took over an hour and a half to come and they advised it would be 45 minutes When I called after the 1 hour mark the woman on the phone made a big show of overacting. Said she would call the driver and that he should be there any minute etcetera still was another 15 minutes at least. Pizza was overpriced and not very good."}
{"text":"W when not even give it one star worst place ever owners are ignorant and hard to understand pizzas never right"}
{"text":"Portofino's has been our go-to for pizza delivery for years  - until tonight. Our last order arrived 30 minutes late, cold, and missing the side of ranch (because pizza isn't pizza without it!). Tonight we gave them a second chance. Almost 2 hours, and we're still waiting. Not feeling optimistic about what we're going to get when it's delivered. But you can bet our credit card had long been charged for it!  Edit: 2 hours, no pizza. Down to one star. But bonus, manager Scott offered me 10% off my next order when I called. Score! Because I'm totes likely to order from them again."}
{"text":"Shouldn't even be one star. Order pizza and a hoagie for delivery. Was told 30 minutes for delivery. An hour later my pizza finally shows up. The delivery \"driver\" gets out of the passanger seat with my food. Throws the cigarette that she is smoking while carrying my food on the ground. All whole im on the phone with the manager and she is telling me that delivery time is 45 minutes. And because I was told 30 minutes on the phone and it was a hour that she's not going to do anything for the customer. Worst customer service i have ever had. Will not order from that place ever again"}
