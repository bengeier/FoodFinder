{"text":"Delicious and authentic at a great price! Fresh ingredients, grilled to order, and corn tortillas. Muy rico!"}
{"text":"Classic tacos with the small tortillas! Kinda disappointed that the Al Pastor taco meat did not come off of a \"trompo\"."}
{"text":"Today when I got my order the meat was missing. The workers also did not notify me or ask to fix the problem until I confronted them and asked why my bag of chips was mostly empty. Apparently they were hoping I wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"Wow amazing fresh food great asada! It's like eating at home! Had their breakfast burrito the best! Their lunch asada burritos the best!"}
{"text":"Don Taco has great authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. I had three tacos; shrimp, fish and shredded chicken with a side of rice and a side of beans. Each taco was loaded and all the ingredients tasted fresh. My boyfriend had the picadillo burrito which was HUGE. We shared some of their home-made lemonade which was a great thirst-quencher. The space isn't that big, with only two or three tables for two and one bar with stools along the side of the restaurant. They make the food Dailey quickly so it's decent for takeout! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the desserts there.  Always a clean place.  Music is too loud in there. Prices of meals are a bit too high.  Nice and respectful staff."}
{"text":"First and last time here! I ordered some Pollo Asada Fries I was not happy with the food it was horrible, poorly made and over priced. The only reason why I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is because the manger provided great customer service."}
{"text":"The worst burrito I've ever had. Undercooked potatoes, lettuce, and ground beef. All terribly wrapped in a flour tortilla. Avoid this place. Don't Taco."}
{"text":"With the hundreds of Mexican food options in the Valley of the sun, choose any except this one. A breakfast burrito cost me $6.49....nearly twice the cost of any other place. A friend ordered a sausage breakfast burrito...he ended up with hot dogs as sausage. Take it from someone who has had years of burrito experience, dont bother coming here."}
{"text":"Tacos are in my top 3ish favourite foods so when I go to taco joints, my expectations are always high.

Don Taco underwhelmed me. I ordered 2 of the ground beef tacos (because it's a classic and will usually be the best gauge for a taco establishment) and a chicken taco. My friend ordered 2 vegetarian tacos.

My tacos weren't terrible but I probably could've just saved myself the disappointment and bought one of those Old El Paso taco mix boxes and gotten better results. My friend seemed to enjoy his vegetarian tacos though so maybe I missed something.

Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Tacos de Pastor were bomb! Staff is friendly and very on top of things. We waiting around five minutes for our food and had everything in our table warm and ready to eat. I recommend trying their Fresas con Crema cup is great to help with your sweet tooth at the end of the meal. Glad we came here instead of regular franchise \"chipotle\"."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos  and asada cheese fries . My kiddos love there fries  snacks 
We will order for pick up. I recommend this place great customer service"}
{"text":"I really can't believe that all these years of living in Avondale I've never been to this place. The street taco style tacos were on point. I did only order 4 tacos of tripa to try them out and I was not disappointed. Although I did feel that the tacos were a bit expensive it was worth it. They also serve raspados and many other treats which is a plus. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Coming from  San Jose and it being Tuesday .. I been craving some bomb mexican food! This is not what i expected for $16 and if my burrito , nasty asada.. No sourcream
In my burrito , barely any meat and the salsa sucks! Basically i went here becuz it was really close to my house n only
Thing close to real mexican food... Ughh i probably wont come back unless it for
The snacks.... The food sucks to me. 
To each is own... Not good authetic mexican"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch there. The staff was super friendly when I asked what they would recommend. I also asked how long it would take because I had an upcoming flight. They went above and beyond to get my order quickly! The tacos were tasty with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best service I have had in a long time, the people here are the best, as soon as we walked in the door the manager came to us with plates with samples of their new item on the menu which by the way was delicious and huge for a great price, I have never felt so welcomed to a place , great job guys"}
{"text":"This place is very average, nothing really wrong with it just not spectacular. Prices are decent too. Best taco here by far is the Lengua (tongue) probably sounds gross to most of you, but the meat is very tender. Problem they only have it half the times that I go there. Also on tuesdays they have a 99 cent taco option, which is basically a deep fried taco with ground beef and some cheese which is alright.."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few weeks ago, just opened.  Very friendly service, freshly made food, hot and tasty.  The price is incredible, just 1.75 each for most Tacos, and on Tuesdays, which I just came from yesterday, they have a $0.99 special per beef-filled taco.  The Tinga so far is my favorite, shredded chicken, lean and delicious. Choice of hot sauces offered at the serving bar, the red one's my favorite, and it's got kick.  Small place, only a few tables, but has a bar with seats along the side that is convenient.  
What could stand improvement is perhaps how orders are placed, which has resulted twice now in small mistakes in the food order, but after which they immediately fixed.  Possible solution is perhaps by offering customers a ticket number so that we can help verify the order when we get it as well? 
All in all though, the combination of price, service and quality of food makes this place outstanding. 
I'm a fan"}
{"text":"2 tacos not happy with it because there are very small tacos. And it cost 2 dollars each. The kids like the tacos but it is not worth the money. Before I even pay for it I asked the cashier are they regular size tacos she told me yes then when I questioned her when I got them she says those are our normal tacos"}
{"text":"Authentic and affordable Mexican tacos in a very obscure dessert shop. 

Get the fish tacos and shrimp tacos. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had the pollo asada fries. OMG they were beyond delicious. They make the food when you order it so it's very fresh, and the food is so flavorful. I would definitely recommend this place if you're craving delicious, authentic Mexican food whether you're in the area or not!! I'll be back for more, since I saw a lot of other yumminess on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. Salsa is very hot not for the weak. Green chile is very good red pork is good also. Bandera wet burrito is huge sauces are spicy but flavorful."}
{"text":"Based off the reviews i was expecting this place to be a hidden gem. At best it was average, and by average i mean extremly mediocre food that wasn't overly authentic. The prices are reasonable, but i guess you get what you pay for.

The tortilla tasted store bought, we heard them heating up our beans in a microwave and the rice had absolutely no flavor nor aroma. The tacos were OK but nothing you'd run home and tell your friends about.

This quaint looking restaurant can pass you by if you blink too quickly. It seats about 10-12 people, so if you're a big group I'd cross this place off your list.

Would i go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Not the place to go.  They go cheap on the meat tacos, I would guess less than an oz of chicken on the two tacos.  Beans were gross and rice was pail without flavor.  I do not get this place."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican meal at affordable and competitive student prices. It's a little tight on space but the feeling of authenticity was completed by my almost complete inability to understand the jolly and pretty cashier's accent. 

Cheap prices, easy access but there isn't many tables with a lot of space. So if you're 4 or more, forget it.

Don't judge a book by its cover. The cover is admittedly pretty sad considering how small the joint is making it incredibly easy to ignore while walking by."}
{"text":"The lady that works here is the cutest. We came in she gave us a sample of the food asked us if we could please try it and it was the best thing I've ever eaten. They are so nice here. Honestly best place to eat after the movies."}
{"text":"Horrible. First of all the service wasn't good and second of all I had a HUGE bone in my tacos. Unacceptable! The tacos had barely any meat in them also. Won't be recommending or ever coming back here."}
{"text":"Ordered three tacos each, shared beans, rice, and guacamole.  Tacos were above average, decent, guacamole was fresh and tasty, beans were quite good, and rice was pleasant with the beans."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying WOW! 

This place was recommended to me by a friend! I'm glade I took her suggestion and went because it was well worth it. I have been here several times and they never seem to disappoint. I have tried the pollo asada fries, carne asada tacos, and a caramelo with homemade tortillas and my personal favorite is  fresas con crema. 

The staff were and extremely friendly, fast and accommodating. The restaurant had a family feel to it which is hard to find nowadays, and the restaurant was clean and organized. 

I strongly recommend this place as I have been here several times and have loved everything I have ordered. I will definitely be back in the future ."}
{"text":"Ok, as a person of Mexican decent and with a strong Mexican cultural background, there hasn't been a place I've came by that has some authentic tacos al pastor del trompo. I'm not talking about like the kind other businesses claim they make and its grilled with a huge slice of pineapple. I'm talking real street tacos al pastor del trompo, on a meat spinner and they cut the meat as it falls on your corn tortilla. A native of California, a frequent visitor to Mexico, and now living in a city that's predominantly Mexican decent AND a border state but can't get any good damn tacos al pastor del trompo?! That's kind of disappointing. But not anymore my fellow Yelpers! This place is amazing. I'm assuming it's gone under new ownership. Peep the picture I've posted. Tacos come with all that, including free guacamole. Salsa is just right and washing it down with an authentic bottle of soda, this just takes me back to the street tacos my family and I enjoy when visiting Mexico. They also serve food outside on a stand. Great for pre or post movie date. Definitely coming by again since the food is delicious, staff is friendly, and the owners are super nice people. Finally, something on the West side."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and I absolutely love Don taco! Their food is so amazing, even my picky family loves it here! Everything I try does not disappoint. The pastor is my favorite as well as the asada fries. The staff is so great and every time I go in, they're always super helpful and sweet. I love bringing friends in here, they always enjoy.  The salsa is good, the food super flavorful and there are lots of options to choose from. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Croissants and tacos? 

Why not blend them together in one sweet spot in the Concordia ghetto. 

One block away from from 3 amigos takes a lot of courage.
Glad to say it passed the test for me, it is very fresh and tasty. The burritos are not gigantic just right sized for me. The choice of sides are mushed up beans, salad and rice with corn.

The price per plate is under 10 dollars for most items, even steak and shrimp.

They have 3 soft tacos for $5


The only downside is the lack of spices so make sure to ask for the sauces trio to complement the burritos and soft tacos."}
{"text":"pretty damn good especially for students on a budget, when I say Cheap I mean cheap, with each taco priced at a $, it would take you around $5 to feel full but it's still cheap that's the great thing. The tacos aren't exceptional but for the price it does great justice."}
{"text":"I stopped by Don Taco the other day for a snack. I won't lie, the 3 tacos for $5 sign out front was what drew me in. For the price, the tacos were good. I mean really, you can't even get 3 tacos at Taco Bell for $5 and these are better than Taco Bell.

So the restaurant is at the back of a bakery/café called Café Desserts Etc. The decor looks like a bakery and not so much a taco joint, but hey whatever.

It's the same staff working both places and the menus are combined into one.

So the 3 for $5 tacos were the Picadillo tacos the day I went (the cashier had to ask the chef what the special taco was, so not sure if it changes daily, or she was new and didn't know). The tacos were on a corn tortilla (I love corn tortillas! Many Mexican fast food places use flour tortillas, boo!). They were filled with ground beef, potatoes, lettuce and sour cream. There were 3 different hot sauces that you could add to your tacos. I tried all of them and liked the green one the most. 

The beef itself was minimal and yes, somewhat reminiscent of Taco Bell, but the taco was tastier and much more interesting than a Taco Bell taco. The potatoes added an interesting texture and taste, and the sauce they were cooked in was flavourful.

Listen, you're not going to get gourmet tacos for the price. I went in expecting fast food tacos and with such expectations, I was pleased with what I got. 

Staff were pleasant and the place was clean.

I would go back."}
{"text":"Was so excited when I found this place on my lunch break. I tried to order a burrito. Lady tells me: they have no flour tortillas, beans or rice. So....I order a taco=that was good. I ordered a tostada of ceviche, it was good; although bland. I had ordered a drink. I ate my whole meal and never got it. I had to stand around and ask if I could have my drink as I was leaving. This place was disappointing. It seems like it has good \"bones\" to be great. But the customer service is just lacking. The tables were left dirty. The floor under boothes had rice. The area that should be salsa and chips bar had napkins in it. And the music was 1990's loud music=bizarre. Hope it gets better for their sake."}
{"text":"Tasty Tacos on Tuesday for only 0.99$! Chips with Guacamole for 2.50$! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not the best great, not bad at all, Mexican street food and grub.

Convenient location for movie goers. Strange they keep pulling stuff from the menu."}
{"text":"Decent tasting tacos and burritos! The prices and the portions are great.

Their burrito is a bit bland sometimes so I definitely recommend getting the tacos instead. 

It's a nice place to sit and eat. If you don't go at peak hours it's quiet and spacious."}
{"text":"Returned there last weekend.
I like the burritos.
The tacos are good too.
Order, sit, eat, pay, leave and be satisfied. That resume well my lunch there."}
{"text":"It was worse than awful, the decoration and maybe name is changed from the pics here. Now is a candy shop with taco and burito . It looks like shit! Really, trust me. Never waste your money"}
{"text":"Asked for a special order for pre Valentines Day. They were exceptional!!! I couldn't believe they were so willing to help to make my loves pre Valentine's Day so special! Thank you Don Taco for the delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Super affordable, especially with the Tuesday special (it only costs 1 dollar but its limited to only one kind, not all of them are 1$).

I usually eat my tacos at Maïs, but its cost twice as much as Don Taco. The plating is not as fancy and the portions are not as generous as at Maïs, but for such a cheap price I won't complain. 

Love how the tortillas have crispy edges. They don't put too much sauce or seasonings, which really brings out the natural flavors of the ingredients, but it can make you feel like it tastes a bit bland...

Great spot to grab a quick and cheap lunch :)"}
{"text":"This is probably my first and last time here. The place looks cool with the cute decor but the tacos are not good at all! I had the special offer of the day $5 for the chicken taco and at my first bite, I was disappointed. Looked like they bought the tacos from the grocery store and just put the sauce and chicken on it! Not good at all. It may be cheap but I didn't like it at all! The flavours were so bland. If you're a foodie and loves flavours and taste, those tacos will disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Just Not For Me

The staff at Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Don Taco/ Taqueria Tacubaya so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my first visit to Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya
 Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.

The salsa at Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa. For my entrée I choose the Carne Asada Tacos, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste and the Carne Asada meat was chopped up into very tiny pieces and was tough to chew.  The meal was just very disappointing.

Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again"}
{"text":"Very good street tacos. Tucked away in a strip mall behind a lot of national names, but I'm pretty sure word of mouth will keep them open. Really good tacos pastor, really good tacos asada. I will be back to work my way thru the menu"}
{"text":"The Asada Fries here literally make Filabertos look like they're serving dog food to people, these people got the Asada Fries craze on point  The tacos are amazing but they are on the smaller side so definitely get the 2 Taco combo if you wanna full up (get an extra combo if you're thicc like me). Customer service is nice, the place is very clean every time I stop by. Definitely an underrated gem in Avondale, worth the try"}
{"text":"I had high expectations from this place because a co-worker suggested I try them. It wasn't memorable. It was just okay. 4 tacos cost 9$"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican tacos - this is the spot hands down. The owners stay true to tradition by using the right spices and not over cooking the meat. The staff is always super friendly and the salsas don't mask or take away from the taste of the food. Seriously the tacos are amazing - the rice and beans are awesome and taste homemade and the antojitos for afterwards always hit the spot. I love the carne asada here but don't be scared to ask for Martin and see what he recommends if you're looking for something different. Don't come here if all you want is some plain burrito- this is a place for real authentic Mexican food. The prices are super fair in comparison to the amazing quality of food. This is a favorite spot for several locals."}
{"text":"Don Taco is located on Ste. Catherine Street West in the Shaughnessy Village area of downtown Montreal. I accidentally came across this place one day and was surprised with their taco offerings. It is difficult to get tacos in Montreal so this was a good find. It would appear that it is paired in the same location with a bakery (not reviewed here). 

The first time I came here I had two tacos from the menu, the Alambre and the Asado, an order of hot pimento peppers and a coke for a little under $9.00. The Asado taco was tender grilled beef served with onion and coriander. The Alhambra was a sauteed chicken taco served with red and green peppers,onions and melted cheese. Both were served on a soft shell corn tortilla. Both were excellent but a little on the small side. I also had a side order of hot Mexican jalapeno peppers. They were precisely that, I could only eat two or three, they were so hot. 

On a Tuesday I returned for the .99 cent Dorado taco special. These were ground beef tacos served with lettuce and cream. They were small yet tasty tacos. I also ordered a side order of refried beans.  This made for an interesting cheapie night paired with a movie at the old Montreal Forum (Pepsi Forum) a few blocks west at Atwater. The decor was very clean and the toilet was extremely spacious, modern and ultra clean. It would appear that the women working here are hard working and dedicated, more power and success to them!"}
{"text":"Really good shrimp tacos. Very fresh food, friendly service. I look forward to returning in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty good eats! The steak was quite flavorful and the serving staff are friendly. I've been accustomed to the burritos from burrito boys or fat bastard so having a burrito that doesn't leave you fully stuffed was surprising to me. But the flavors are simpler and quite nice from this place. 3.5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  Nothing to write home about as some of the reviews stated.  I think it was expensive for what we got....I'd eat there again...only if I was going to see a movie as it sit right next to the theater.  Somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't confuse this place with the name Don Taco on the front.. The new name of the place is Taqueria Tacubaya.. This place is amazing from the Tacos to the Tostilokos, Mangoneadas, Pepihuates and the owners are very friendly small business owners that would appreciate your business and always making sure you are satisfied before you leave , Delicious Mexico City food.. Only eat here if you love authentic food"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, the people are so nice and is looks authentic, but the quote after attempting to eat a taco from my wife was \"this is the worst meat I've ever had\"  I personally don't much care for places like this, half of the menu has been redacted, but like I said we really had high hopes that were crushed.  Even the neighborhoods stray cat wouldn't eat any of it"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican restaurant ever, roaches crawling in the bathroom, employees poorly treated by management/owners and constantly closing between business hours. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for after/before the movies. The Strawberry raspado is not good. It tastes like watered down jelly. Also, why they charge extra for lechera really bothers me. We really like the churros locos here BUT they are not real CHURROS they are CHURROMAIS the chips. But they still taste good just not original."}
{"text":"Working in Tolleson, there is a ton of Mexican food spots. A coworker recommended this spot, so we went- it was amazing! We got carne asada with corn tortillas and every topping they offered. It was amazing. Quick service and really friendly people working the place. Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"While traveling down Saint Catherine Street we wandered upon Don Taco and decide to try out this little hole in the wall since we are in the mood for some Mexican food.

Walking into the restaurant we didn't have high expectations for the overall quality, but after dining here I have to give it to them and say that they are pretty decent. 

We ended up getting cow tongue tacos which were delicious and since it came with a combination of rice and beans we paid very little for a really filling meal. The beans were a little watery and the rice wasn't the most flavorful but overall the food was really great and the service here was great as well. 

Having a wife who is part Mexican can sometimes lead to some heated discussions around good Mexican food and I have to say that she enjoyed the meal which was a surprise for the middle of Canada."}
{"text":"Be wary of the Sunday meals. Most menu items not available. Took the narrowed down food suggestions and promptly became ill.
Nice people behind the counter though but the family is here all sick."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch yesterday and both husband and I thought it wasn't all that great.

We both got a burrito with guacamole and pico de gallo. I've had better meat before. It didn't even taste like asada and it was definitely way too salty. I was thirsty for hours.

There's a salsa bar (we tried a red salsa and a green one. Green one was OK. The red one tasted too much like tomato sauce. Nothing special) but you get no chips with your burrito, you have to pay extra for them.

It was our first time there and most likely we won't go back. There are better Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Worst taco ever tried in my entire life!!! 

I ordered beef soft tacos. The tortillas were stale, the meat was tasteless stinky ground beef, not even inducing the feel of having tacos in your hands! Felt like there was a piece of stale bread with some low quality ground beef! 
Overall quality= 0

Never come back!"}
{"text":"I find it just ok. I'd give it a 2.5 if I could but definitely not a 3, so...2 it is. By just ok I mean that you won't feel hungry afterwards nor feel sick, you won't need to frown when eating those tacos but won't remember what they taste like as soon as you're done with your meal. There's nothing special to it, the tortillas seem to be store bought and sauces pre made and watery like almost every other Mexican place in Montreal...

Or maybe I'm just being picky having lived in Mexico for many years..."}
{"text":"This probably my favorite taco place not only are the tacos delicious the antojitos are bomb!I love their fresas con crema and Tostitos."}
{"text":"Been a hot minute craving for some tacos. Was driving around trying to get myself familiarized with the area and found this spot. Let me tell you, so far best tacos I had since I moved out to Arizona. The place was empty but it was inviting. Music playing in the background and a telenovela on the tv. I order the usual asada tacos with rice and beans and a side of horchata. Meat fresh off the grill and the perfect temperature on the rice and beans. Friendly workers and food was brought to my table. Mind you I was the only one in the restaurant. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is they automatically think I speak Spanish  other than that top spot for some Hispanic food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Martin the owner brought us samples to our work place and I was amazed. The meat was so soft and it had so much flavor. This is our to go to taco spot."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5/5 rating because it is awesome! Located in a shared space with a cake maker, the food was way, way authentic.

The food tasted amazing. Had the tacos Pastor with rice and beans. Well made, home made, fresh spicy salsa. I'm very pick about my Mexican and I have to say, this one passed.

It's a no thrills place - no bar service and small but that's fine with me.

If you want authentic flavor and not too expensive, go here."}
{"text":"Closer than we had thought, my boyfriend and I had difficulty finding the place: what used to be Don Taco was now a currency exchange. Looking around, we noticed the adjacent dessert restaurant had displayed the Don Taco menu on its window and that's when we realized they must have been conjoined? Confused, we looked at the menu: it seems promising. And it was a Tuesday, so there was a deal on tacos ($1 tacos). We went in.
The place didn't feel at all like a Mexican restaurant since, after all, it was in a dessert shop. We felt a little out of place when we sat down, with the bright pink juxtaposing the black and white furniture. The couches and chairs were comfortable, though. 
I ordered 4 tacos, which were their generic taco formula of ground beef, potatoes, lettuce, and cheese. My boyfriend had one taco and a picadillo burrito. 
The food was served promptly and warmly, fresh and promising. The tacos looked like tacos, and the burrito was wrapped in tin foil. I took a bite out of my taco and received mixed feelings: while the shell was weak in its rigidity and almost wet (lacking adequate crunch and satisfaction), the taco filling was delicious. The ground beef had  the right amount of flavor that was balanced by the lettuce and cheese. The potatoes added an additional surprise and savoriness to the overall taco, making up for the taco shell. My boyfriend's picadillo burrito though was absolutely scrumptious. If we go back, I'm definitely getting one of their burritos."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing!!!!!!!! Great price super tasty tacos .small but lots of room. And 99c on Tuesdays cannot beat it for the location right in town 
 Nice for a quick bite or even dinner 
Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos, and quite cheap. Authentic, run by Mexicans. Can't beat their price if you're on a budget and are looking for something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"This place has nice cheap tacos and on Tuesdays, they have a special Taco Tuesday which has really cheap tacos. Don Taco is small little place with few seats but I get the feeling that this place is more of a takeaway place than dine-in. The tacos here are pretty good and the staff are Mexican; and from what I'm hearing the food here is really authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Superb food and great service.. do try their sausages. Worth going on any crazy/lazy day."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.  I order a medium lemonade and my total was 3 dollars. And the Manger who took my order didn't give me a receipt. Later on that day, I checked my bank account and I noticed she charged me 90 dollars for a lemonade. I went back and spoke with the same Manger. She called me a liar and she refused to give me my money back. I even showed her my account balance and she refused to speak with me."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ordered nachos that said they only had mozzarella cheese, just for them to put nacho cheese on them. When we asked to switch out the order for something else because we DID NOT LIKE THE FOOD, they rudely said no. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Cozy spot next to the Harkins not inexpensive by any means but the quality and the flavor was very good.  Had the entertainment book coupon , buy 1 get 1 of equal value so we tried the Asada fries  great, and the two taco special we had the barbacoa.  The tacos are overstuffed small yes, but really enough filling for four tacos easily. The beans are nice they are whole beans, the rice itself was eh."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Don Taco is in the back of a bakery. A bit small and not the most spectacular place out there. The decor is kind of tacky. Also the bathroom door is very hidden because it's has the same design of the wall, it's like playing find-it.

FOOD: The food is decent. It's nothing that will make you fall out of your seat and the quality isn't the freshest but nonetheless, it's still not bad if you add their hot sauces to your food. Portions are pretty small as well.

PRICE: Very affordable. They have 1$ tacos on Tuesdays which is great! Note that you will be getting what you pay for so don't expect anything fancy. 

SERVICE: Personally, every time I have gone there, the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Unimpressive tacos. Main problem for me is the portion: Toppings/fillings come in small quantities although the tortilla is of standard size. The taste of corn is then very present, but the overall feel is blander than what it could have been. Some examples I want to point out is, firstly, the shrimp taco. It contained literally 3 small shrimps, such that half the bites were 100% vegetarian. As for the pastor taco, I could have rolled myself a mini burrito full of dough with that small amount of meat. 

A random observation is tortillas are sometimes crispy, sometimes soft, and it's independent of what I order.

The meals can be accompanied with 3 different kinds of chipotle salsa, ranging from mild, spicy, and spicier. All I can say is that the salsas really add another dimension of flavor, although it tends to overwhelm the whole taste if added in generous quantities. I suggest glazing the taco with a thin layer of salsa for the best result.

Otherwise, for people on a student budget, Don Taco offers deals that seem really too good to pass up. However, the 0.99$ taco on Tuesdays or the 3/5$ tacos are filled with potatoes, with a hint of beef. They're not worth the money.

Considering the competition around that neck of the woods, I'm surprised they justify 2.75$ with a half empty taco."}
{"text":"Tried their al pastor tacos earlier this evening. My fiance and I have tried al pastor all over phoenix and this restaurant has by far the best. What caught our attention is that the al pastor is cooked outside and directly from the spit grill which is how it should be cooked!! The flavor is great. We waited quite a bit which is why I rated 4 stars. The corn in a cup I ordered took even longer. They  need more staff."}
{"text":"Great Tacos and tortilla soup. Great food, not overpriced.

Get one of each taco and share with your best friend.

I bit disorganized in terms of ordering, but the food tastes so good its worth it.

Enjoy"}

I told her that Citibank, which maintains the Citi Easy Deals portal, is a huge worldwide bank, and would never issue fraudulent coupons to their clients.  I also told her I have been successfully using BOGO coupons from Citi Easy Deals for several years, and have never had any issues.  Most recently - BoonGarden in old Avondale, Ada's Fish Fry in Goodyear, Tortas Paquime in Avondale, El Salvadoreno in Phoenix, Fuego Bar and Grill in Tolleson (which was a horrible experience btw).  

Despite me asking her to call the Validation Line clearly printed on the coupon, or go to the entertainment.com website also printed on the coupon, she refused to honor the coupon, made no attempt at a concession, repeated that it must be fraudulent, and turned my husband away.    

What a horrible experience indeed!  I filed a complaint via Citi Easy Deals, and just wanted to let any other Citi Easy Deals users know to not waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona where there is a huge variety of Mexican food places and I've been searching for cheap authentic Mexican food ever since I moved to Montreal.  This is the first place I've found that meet both of those those two criteria well - \"Cheap and Authentic\". I will be coming here more often now that I've found this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so fresh, authentic, tasty and super affordable. One of the best tacos I've had in Montreal for about half the price. My only complaint is that the taco shell (though very tasty) was hard to pick up because it was falling apart a bit."}
{"text":"I implore you: Please please help Montreal mexican cuisine by treating yourself to Don Taco and supporting local businesses that are truly adding to the cultural diversity of the city instead of acting as hipster flytraps for white 20-somethings.

Somehow it came to pass that a single Taco in Montreal should cost 6$ and be regarded as some kind of luxury. So I'm thankful for whatever confluence of disparate events that led to the existence of Don Taco - this miraculous Mexican food shelter serving 2-3$ amazing and delicious corn tortilla tacos. 

I'll call it authentic, and your eyes will start to roll from how cliche it is nowadays to call something authentic. Yet I swear they'll unroll as soon as the flavours of an Al Pastor taco reach the tip of your tongue. 

Keep in mind it's a tiny place, so either be happy eating while standing at the small counter/bar, or take your food to go. This is a great place to stop by for a quick snack while you're doing the million things you can be doing in the downtown core.

Whatever you do don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Don Taco is an oasis in a land of strange, over priced tacos. 

The tacos are nice, cheap, and legitimately central american. When I first discovered Don Taco I ended up going there something like 7 times in 2 weeks (don't judge :p). The food is always good and reasonably fast. The staff are super nice even when I've F'd up my own order. 

I've run through the menu of tacos, and dipped into the burrito menu. 

I have to say the fish tacos are really the standout. There can be no regrets with tacos. 

For now Montreal's taco battle is firmly Don Taco vs. Cafe Frida."}
{"text":"Seems like it's under new ownership. 
They've added Mexican snacks and munchies which is a good idea. 

Their mangoneadas are good, but don't be disappointed when it doesn't look like the picture.  Yes, I know not to expect the picture but when you get less than half the slices of mangos in the picture, I cry a little bit inside.  I still get them though, they're tasty!

Their verduras are enormous and better than the picture. 

As for the food, it seems like they improved the taste for a lot of the items, but have considerably gotten smaller in serving size. 
Their burritos used to be able to fill you up, but now they're less than filling, at least in my and coworkers' opinions."}
