{"text":"Great outdoor venue! Went when there was a live band (who actually were kind enough to let me sing with them) and it was a really fun time. Beautifully built outdoor bar with swings for seats. The owners are friendly and very welcoming. Felt more like we were at a friend's party in their backyard than at a bar! Good beer selection, large apps menu, and good burgers! Wonderful experience all over and I highly recommend going!"}
