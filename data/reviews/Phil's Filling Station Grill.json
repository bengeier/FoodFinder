{"text":"I was overwhelmed by the variety offerred on the menu, and the food quality was excellent.  I had the Turkey Ruben.  I expected your standard lunchmeat turkey, but the meat on this sandwich was like freshly carved Thanksgiving bird.  They have a nice variety of beer.  NIce atmosphere full of coca-cola nostolgia.  The service was excellent.  I'm m driving 25 miles to Fountain Hills today just to eat at Phil's."}
{"text":"First time here.  We are BIG Coke fans so we were excited.  Got the Pot Roast sandwich. Meat was cut very thick so it was tough and dry.  We ordered a side of gravy and it helped a lot.  Fries were very good and NE Clam Chowder was delicious and meaty.  Service (Sydney) was GREAT!  We would probably go back but the bathrooms are somewhere out the back of the restaurant... literally out the back door.  My wife headed that way and was uncomfortable with the people hanging around back there.  The other dinners we saw delivered to other customers looked good!"}
{"text":"A big thumbs down! First impressions are everything restaurant owners and managers and this was our first and last time at Phil's. Immediately upon entering I began peeking into the bar area to view how busy the sports bar was and when doing so the owner very rudely and in front of other customers told us we couldn't sit and we could only sit at the bar. With his unfriendly tone of voice we should have left right then but took 2 seats at the very end of this bar. The place appeared busy with lack of help which the stress of keeping up was visibly displayed by the owner and bartender however after about 5 minutes the bartender caught up to us and was apologetic with the wait. He promptly served us which is the only reason we stayed. While we were sitting  and talking the owner came up next to  us grabbing a chair across the floor which the noise was obnoxious and made me stop mid sentence. No finesse, no class and definitely no warm and fuzzy feeling to invite us back. Again, first impressions are valuable and people who cannot even fake good customer service should not be in customer service!"}
{"text":"Good food for the price! I had the pot roast sandwich, it was very tasty! Wide variety on the menu something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Small lil hole n the wall perfect if you roll out of bed and don't feel like attempting to get dressed up to go to lunch. There were two servers with quite a few tables and they were working hard...you go girls. I would freaking hate working at a place with an open kitchen for all the customers to peer into and stick their nose in what food is in the window wondering if its theirs getting cold lol. We did a to go order...I  got the shrimp avocado salad& the clam chowder...salad and dressing were DELICIOUS although the shrimp was dry I have a feeling it was frozen shrimp not fresh which makes it easy to give a dry texture. Clam chowder was awesome ...it had tender clams was creamy and had a wine flavor to it which I love. ( in, an out of food). Things that come to mind when waiting & observing the \"ambiance\" ....church, old people, new York accents, the movie waiting ( although I hope that was just the white chef coats that steered my imagination in that direction) . My boyfriend got the rueben which he said was so so and the fries were very old looking/ tasting. I would go back considering they have everything from meatloaf & chicken fried steak to gyros...HUGE MENU with lots to try and my meal was pretty good. Might have just been a very busy day and got the short end of the stick on good old rueben. I felt the shrimp salad was overpriced since the shrimp wasn't prime per say,  but hey I don't pay the rent there. Overall id say it was a good experience,  im giving it 3 stars due to the shrimp and the rueben ...and the fact that I need to try it again before I can bump it up on the scale...worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Yvonne E., Just to inform you (because it's obvious you don't have the facts) the water is indeed VERY FILTERED.  They have a coke free style machine and if you knew anything about the so called unfiltered water you mistakenly think you had... You would know that to even have that machine they Coca Cola requires you to have intense filtration.  They actually send in their own guys to put filters on not only the water lines to the machine but to the ice maker as well.  They also have a crew that goes and checks everything on a regular basis.  It's a very elite and expensive machine to have and if their water filters don't stand up to par for you then I feel sorry for you because you're probably the type of individually who is never quite satisfied.  Next time ask them to get you a glass from they freestyle machine and one from the sink... Then we'll talk ."}
{"text":"Service was the very best.The food was so so.
I had a steak which was cooked perfect.
The wife had ribs and they were tough."}
{"text":"None filtered water ...    Processed food .. Hello GMO  Toxic wast site .. Try Organic real food and stop the crap ur feeding ur customers. That's  right it's cheap ...Well u get what u pay for ?!?!?"}
{"text":"Horrible, avoid!
The food is just a bunch of frozen junk!  It smells of grease.  Nothing fresh here.  My son got food poisoning from a rancid hamburger.  As a long time resident of FH, I have given this place way too many chances.  I'm done!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place, truly. Fountain Hills needs some good, diverse dining options. I've been on a quest to find such for 4 years. This place misses the mark. 

Arrived during a slow period. Service was slow. Ordered a burger, after a long wait, got one that had an overwhelming taste of gas grill. It was overpowering. Just awful. Mentioned it to our waitress, not even a blink of her eye. 

2 people, waste of $33 and at least an hour or more of time. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Being a former general manager of a restaurant it is very difficult for me to go anywhere and not judge ticket time, food quality, service etc and I can say this if you are looking for a place that hits every mark right on....what are you waiting for?  Go to Phil's! We were greeted by Phil who told us to take a seat,  Nicole was our server, after hiring people for over 15 years I can say this if I had found one like Nicole I would have been thrilled...I hired fabulous people but she was truly the best of the best.....pulled Phil aside a few times to ask him what his favorites were and he was so pleasant , helpful and explained the menu and made suggestions. We started with coconut chicken strips....I liked them so much I ordered them for dinner.....everyone loved their food! From the pasta to their burgers  the food was served hot, the prices were good as the quality of the food you could tell was above average to most restaurants of this caliber.  All in all a great experience it was totally worth the 40 minute drive and will make it a regular place to frequent. Great bar and entertainment (Elvis impersonator ) on sat night. It is hard to please me as I am such a perfectionist...but Phil's filling station sure did....now what are you waiting for? Go check it out......I dare you to tell me you had a negative experience!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent lunch with my hubby yesterday. Excellent service and food. Portions were so generous I ate the rest for lunch today."}
{"text":"We've been here many times but won't be back after today. No acknowledgement upon entering, then finally seated by the apparent owner who treated us like garbage... as pests who were inconveniencing him by being there. He was a total a-hole to us. Our regular waitress is also very unpleasant and always screws up. Plus she also always treats us like inconvenient pests. Today was the last straw. Coffee is total slop... lukewarm brown water. Cream is fake. Food is mediocre at best and certainly not worth the bad service and being treated like crap. But it does have very cool Coca-Cola decor! We'll go to Denny's or Flapjacks from now on! Happy New Year Phil."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at Phil's Filling Station this evening...great service, delicious food, extensive menu, and very generous portions!  Very satisfied!   :-)"}
{"text":"Was hesitant to come here at first thought it was going to be a cheap version of Denny's. HOWEVER  I was completely wrong. When I first walked in I noticed how welcoming the restaurant was. Very cozy and family friendly. The staff was extremely friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. The bartender was our server(tiny brunette, forgot her name)but she was so sweet and did such an amazing job Food was extraordinary. We ordered burgers wings and a milkshake. Came out to perfection  and very quickly. This will be me and my boyfriends favorite place. Thank you"}
{"text":"Saved by the bar tender but barley on service and being polite at the door. I walked in and was rudely told not sit anywhere at the bar if I wanted a drink. I knew that but could have went about another way. I did not eat there but unfortunately if the food is good I could care less now."}
{"text":"In the spirit of full disclosure hubby said he had a beer while waiting for his order, so that added to the $28 total."}
{"text":"Phil has excellent cocktails and a full menu of eggs to pasta and fish. Had the eggplant parm..very good. My partner had the pork chop special and calamari appetizer. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in Fountain Hills! Only complaint is the bench seats are brutal."}
{"text":"We have gone to Phil's several times. My husband likes it because of all the sport TV's in the bar and he likes their Rueben. I on the other hand have been disappointed in their food. I am vegan due to severe heart disease. I will have chicken or fish once a month or so. I have had their salads which taste like they are made from a bag and not fresh. Had veggies that were still partially frozen. Last night was the last straw. Ordered their veggie burger and they brought me a turkey burger. Waiter apologized, took it back and ten minutes later they brought me out another turkey burger (or possibly the same one).  I again told the waiter that there were no veggies in the burger he brought me. He went back in the kitchen and came back out and said that the cook swore that it was a Boco burger. Being vegan, I know what a Boco burger looks and taste like and this was NOT a Boco burger. I ended up eating it. It tasted like a processed turkey burger to me. The waiter didn't say anything, but must have felt bad because he comped our bill. We hadn't eaten there for a long time and if I have my way, we will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Huge selection of food for whatever mood you're in, great nastalgic atmosphere, all Coca-Cola themed. Only reason place doesn't deserve 5 stars is because of their overpriced menu, but the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"I don't get the rating. I am extremely picky as is my wife and we have never had a bad meal. Always hot, fresh, large portions and friendly service. People rate restaurants on such stupid things like, waitress was rude, I didn't like the pictures on the wall etc., lol. If you want great food, go there, burgers great, and personally the turkey Reuben is my fave!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this a try tonight.   We've been by it many times.   Perhaps 2 1/2 stars would be better than the 2

My wife and daughter had the fish fry and I the BBQ burger.     The food was average at best.  We all felt it just lacked flavor.   Was not bad, but was not good either.  Portions seemed fine (some other reviewers had commented on that).     Service was also average.   Didn't even come back to ask about a refill on the drink.     

There are so many really good places to eat that I don't think we will be back.    I was hopeful that it would be good as we live in FH but oh well"}
{"text":"I'm confused by the reviews. Yes, the customer service was good. The food, however, was anything but good! I'm not trying to be rude. I just would like to give an honest review, because I'm shocked at all the high ratings, and if you're from out of town this is not the place I would go to. Again, this isn't bashing the service."}
{"text":"We live in Fountain Hills year around.  We have been here a few times for breakfast and it was ok - nothing special but not bad either.  Until today...our waitress was horrible.  We places our order and 3 other tables walked in after us.  All others got their food before us and we only had a breakfast wrap and biscuits and gravy and a bowl of fruit.  We asked for our waitress and she didn't come.  We asked for lemons which didn't come - we had to ask another waitress who brought them. We asked for a glass of ice...she never brought it. When our food arrived the gravy on the biscuits was barely warm.  Grease was pouring out of the wrap - it couldn't be picked up.  Had to eat the inside of wrap an toss the wrap. The waitress never came to check on us.  When she came with the bill I mentioned how greasy the wrap was.  Her comment \"well you ate it didn't you\". Excuse me? I ate the inside of the wrap.  I didn't order a wrap to only eat the insides.  And I ordered a wrap so I COULD pick it up.  Have you ever heard that the customer is always right even if they aren't?  Unfortunately, Phil's just lost a year around customer and if you are a FH restaurant you know you can't afford to lose a year around customer! Service and attitude is everything."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat.waited to be helped no one would seat us.After 5 min someone finally told us it would be 15 min before they could seat us then made us put our name on a waiting list after people who had just come in were put on the waiting list before us. Not impressed with the service and just decided to leave."}
{"text":"I'll admit - I'm a fan of casual kitsch and Phil's fits my mood, when I'm in it! I love all the Coke memorabilia (especially at Christmas time, when the rest of the \"stuff\" comes out) - and the booths and tables feel very nostalgic. I haven't explored a \"lot\" of the menu yet...because it's a LOT of menu! But everything I've had so far has been very good! I've had burgers on a couple of occasions (seriously - these are GOOD, fresh, not-pre-fab burgers), and the Reuben burger is my favorite! When they say you won't leave hungry...you WON'T leave hungry!!! I've also had the shrimp po' boy and it was hot, fresh and the avocado and lime mayo MADE the sammich!!! And I stopped by one night with a friend and we shared a spicy beef quesadilla and two French onion soups! Warm, filling and happy-making! The place can get PACKED, especially when the car stuff is going on out back - but service is always good. If they're a little slow or make a mistake, they're very quick to apologize and give an incentive to come back next time! I know that I can take adventurous or (even more challenging) non-adventurous eaters to Phil's and everybody is going to leave happy! And I look forward to exploring more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The menu states that they have been voted best breakfast, lunch and dinner nearly every year since approx 2001 for the Fountain Hills area this is why I went.  Are these folks flying in from third world countries because my palate experience was bar food. The Coca Cola Products Collection cluttered throughout the restaurant was more appealing than the food. If you are looking for a filler or something with large portions for 8-12 bucks go here for average food. The fact that they were voted best of any meal should be a slap in the face to other restaurants in the area who work hard to present quality cuisine to the residents of the Fountain Hills.  They get 3 stars for being average what a let down."}
{"text":"Best omelette in town! Had the veggie and it was perfect! Cute coca cola atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"My wife & I eat here at least twice a month & absolutely love it, from the food quality to the variety on the menu, to the staff, it's all good. We've tried many different things on the menu and have never been disappointed. I don't understand some of the negative reviews but I guess that's what makes the world go round."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Phil's since 2000 and never had a complaint.  The menu has a wide variety of items and all of the classics.  The decor is charming and nostalgic and the music is oldies that brings us back in time.  All our visitors are brought here and we have heard nothing but praise.  The wait staff is friendly and fast and you can eat and converse without shouting above others or banging your chair on someone else's. My favorite dinner is country fried steak, and my husband prefers one of their many burgers. It's a soothing, relaxing way to enjoy comfort food.  On nice evenings you can eat on tables outside and see the fountain.  Sometimes if there is a musical event you can hear it all from there.  We'll continue to be frequent customers!"}
{"text":"Late lunch...... Large variety on the  menu. I had the filling station special (grilled ham and cheese) plenty of thin sliced ham with a very good Dijon mustard sauce. My friend had the fountain hill club wrap which was enough for two people very good! Service was prompt and courteous"}
{"text":"Don't let the size if the menu scare you away! I try to have something different every time and Everything I've had is really good!!"}
{"text":"I've had to downgrade my review of this place. My first visit there with my mother was pleasant enough but we both noticed that the prices for the portion sizes make this place pretty expensive. 

Upon further visits this:

One time I ordered the stroganoff. It was flavorless reheated slop that made me sick for two days. 

On another recent visit, and my last visit, I had a burger that tasted like the inside of a freezer. Freezer burn, idk. It tasted old, stale, and dry. I took two bites and tossed it. 

I couldn't get a refill of my coke and I had to go to the counter to get someone to give me a check so I could leave. The place wasn't busy, myself and one whole other table. So I don't know what the problem was. 

It's well known that Sysco food products supplies this restaurant, so, it's unclear to me why they call their food \"homemade\" when it isn't and why the prices are so high. 

I give two stars because, even though it's over done and prosaic, I enjoy coke and coke products.  and they have one of those fancy new coke machines.  Go there to get a coke but don't expect to get a refill. 

Additionally:  the owner himself might want take some courses in manners. I've heard him argue with customers, venders, and staff in the past. Among other things I won't mention here. It's uncomfortable and unprofessional. 

And phils attitude \"if you don't like it, buy me out\" (printed on the menu) speaks volumes about the value he places on customers and the public. 

."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink! Food is fresh and homemade each day and excellent for breakfast too."}
{"text":"Quirky is the best way to describe Phil's. They have an extensive menu  I tried prime rib and my son had a French dip.  The food was good diner food but not great.  Service was good.  All in all the prices are not bad and the food is pretty good.  I will definitely come again and try some different dishes. We had the mud pie for desert it was kinda freezer burned. One weird thing is the bathrooms are located outside.  Kinda strange.  The dining room is a kitschy shrine to coca cola if your into that type of thing."}
{"text":"Two stars because of the view. the food wasn't amazing. I think this would be better identified as a drinking spot. In fact it probably is a bar turned breakfast in the morning. Huge menu options, but we were on the hunt for breakfast so we didn't go far from the first page. I'd go back to sip cocktails on the patio and watch the fountain, but not for eats."}
{"text":"Nice, homey place.  We had great service and we're very grateful for the special care that they showered our toddler with!  Food was good and portions were generous, however a bit pricey.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Possibly the biggest menu I've ever seen. Food is great and very reasonable. Decent atmosphere and well worth the stop."}
{"text":"I called here one day, asking for a to-go order.
The guy that answered, grumbled something incoherent, and set the phone down.  No one ever responded to me, so I hung up.
Judging from all the bad reviews, I don't believe I missed out on anything.
Seems like this place must be a \"front\" for something."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Had a great chicken salad! My husband had a burger, have eaten here often always great food and friendly service reasonable prices also!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant in Fountain Hills. The interior is a throwback of Coke decor with some great classic music playing. The service was great and the food was great! The menu is large but the hey a kitchen that can make anything!!!

The exterior is a stone's throw from the lake and everything about Fountain Hills is pretty.

So happy to support a local shop like this and we plan on continuing to visit Phil's!"}
{"text":"As a gay man I must say that the owner Phil is the closest to a Chippendale dancer I've ever scene. He is beautiful and one heck of a chef.  The cuisine is amazing all homemade and from scratch no greasy fast food.  This place serves the best food in town and by fast friendly waitstaff try the Italian omelette for bfast and The Veal Osobuca with lobster ravioli ( off the menu by request ) it's out of this world for din din followed by the creme brûlée for desert. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Favorite place in Fountain Hills to eat. Prices are quite reasonable and the food is awesome. I have eaten my way around the menu and don't think there was a single thing I disliked. The portions are huge! Most of the time I was talking half of it home. For a place with such a big menu I would have thought most of the food was frozen sysco crap and its isn't. They make everything fresh and don't cut corners anywhere. The staff has always been nice and helpful as well. Only negative I think is the hours, they close at 9pm and they start shutting down about 8 limiting where you can sit which can be a pain at times. They are also only open for a few hours on sunday."}
{"text":"This place had it all!  The owner Phil walks around and greets you.  The place is clean.  The food is great! I came because someone recommended it to me!"}
{"text":"Didn't have good service. The menu is amazing and so extensive, my expectations were high. However, it took too long to get our food, we had to ask for everything including our bill. We definitely wouldnt go again and we have talked to many of our friends who have had the same experience. Its impressive, at first, and I think if they focused on a simpler menu, maybe they could do a better job all around."}
{"text":"I have been repeatedly disappointed by this place. The menu is really your first clue, if you are offering 20 sandwiches, 15 burgers and 30 different dinner entrees, I don't think any of them can be done well or freshly prepared (hello frozen!). The latest trip I made here was for breakfast and it was so disappointing.

No one came around for coffee refills. At breakfast. Yikes. I had a breakfast wrap that was unappetizing, the cheese inside almost seemed like a processed nacho cheese, no real flavor. The presentation is terrible, comes out on tiny, cheap cafeteria plates and does in fact look like it was prepared in a cafeteria. 

The icing on the cake is the owner Phil. He's never friendly and usually has a scowl on his face. Please don't make yourself visible to customers and serve food if you can't be friendly! 

Bottom line, you would be much better off going to The Good Egg, Chompies or Flapjack's. Actually, you would be better off going anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"We had really poor, slow, unfriendly service and the food (breakfast potatoes in particular) was obviously from a freezer bag. Tasteless, low-quality food.  Would not go back again."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast. The gobbler omelette and chicken fried steak were delicious. Fast, friendly service & our drinks were always refilled promptly."}
{"text":"Came to Fountain Hills to check the town out and of course see the fountain.    After cruising around and realizing there wasn't anything to do in Fountain Hills we found this restaurant to have lunch.

We had a gyro sandwich which was really tasty!    I'd totally order it again.   

We also had a chinese chicken salad that was just average.     

Super cute Coca Cola themed diner.   Loved all the Coke stuff hanging on the walls.    Felt like I was back in the 1950's."}
{"text":"Totally awesome food and service. We had a  hamburger and a fried chicken dinner. Reviewer is not blowing sunshine.  The chicken would make the Colonel turn over. Make sure your come here. Ask for Mililano, descendant of Pancho Villas"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is casual and friendly and the food is very good. We enjoy going to Phil's and recommend this place for sure. The service in the bar area can be spotty so like Cori V's review, they lost the fifth star. Good sized portions and the food has always been served hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice fresh salad for lunch.  Dressing was just right and shrimp were plump, juicy and hot."}
{"text":"The best food place in FH! All the food on the menu is amazing and the service is even better. They exceed your expectations. The owner is so kind and a great person! I 100% recommend coming here! Definitely try their specials and attend the bar which also has great service."}
{"text":"Go here if you're really, really hungry. I'm not a fan of Coke but I do have to say that I enjoyed the over-the-top display of Everything-Coke-Related. Hubby had a burger and said it was the best burger he ever had. Daughter had the kids mac n' cheese and loved it (it looked suspiciously like Kraft but she swears it tasted truly homemade). I had fish tacos which were just fine. Fried, of course. The options for healthy eating are sort of slim here, so you have to know that going in. Otherwise, perfectly good hearty food."}
{"text":"Very nice family owned business.  I was there with a very large party and they gave us a private room.  The people were friendly and the food was good.  They have a full bar but the drink prices are a little expensive."}
{"text":"I like to refer to the owner as Mr. No Personality. The prices are about 20% too high but the waitresses are friendly and attentive and the food is consistent."}
{"text":"Phil's has such an extensive menu. Went here for breakfast- had the apple cinnamon pancakes which were out of this world! For dinner they have everything under the sun! A must-try if in Fountain Hills and wanting a casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I started going to Phil's when I moved to Fountain Hills in 2010. At first I went because my name is also Phil and I wanted to meet this guy and see what his restaurant was like.

 I was pleasantly surprised at the selection, the service, and, when I got my first meal there, the quality of the food and it's preparation. I soon became a regular, and our church uses Phil to cater some of our events. It's Also one of the preferred \"Go to\" places for breakfast or lunch after church. 

Yes, the Coca Cola theme is nice, the view is great, and Phil is a wonderful guy. But the main reason you need to go to Phil's is the FOOD! 

PS. They have a loyalty program, and they are Biker friendly. 

I moved back to Chicago for two years, went back there yesterday, and it's even better than before. They've upgraded their appetizer menu and it's awesome!"}
{"text":"3/17/13 - definitely a diners, drive-ins and dives kind of place. All decorated for St. Paddy's Day including waiters, waitresses and staff. Waitress was friendly but disappeared for long periods of time. The special corned beef and cabbage was really good (including Kelly green potatoes). The roasted half chicken was terrible (tasted like grocery store bought deli chicken frozen and reheated in microwave. . . Yuk). The only saving part of the dish was the mashed potatoes and cider gravy."}
{"text":"Okay. The best grilled ham and cheese I've had in Arizona. Served with Swiss on an onion roll, it was piled high with ham and was positively delicious. The place obviously loves Coke, as that is the décor. Just up the street from the famous fountain. Reasonable prices, and the menu just goes on and on. While eating, was listening to other diners, all of whom had positive things to say about their meals. Will definitely go back. The question is, with a sandwich as good as their ham and cheese, will I ever try anything else on their menu?"}
{"text":"Great decor, horrible service and bad food. Ordered the bbq pork sandwich. Dry and luke warm.   Hubby ordered the prime rib. It was tough and luke warm as well."}
{"text":"This was our hair day choice.  Lois Judd and I get our hair done and then pick a place to eat afterward.  We have been making the rounds and Phil's was next.  I had a delicious burger, well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Lois was also pleased with her lunch as well.  Service was great and the price was right.  There were so many things on he menu it was hard to choose.  So that means we have to go back!"}
{"text":"There were eight of us that went here for dinner last night and dropped over $200 before tip and I must say it was the worst food and service I've experienced in many years! The waiter was rude and treated us like we were an inconvenience just by being there. The food was gross and that's a compliment... My veal was over cooked and looked like it had been sitting there hours prior to my arrival under a heat lamp, the sauce tasted and had the consistency of tomato paste and about as much flavor the mozzarella cheese was the lowest quality there is to where it barley melted. Others at the table ordered chicken Parmesan, the Reuben sandwich burgers steak and cheese and their food too was low quality! Not one of us finished our meal... I'll never ever return back here! There's way to many other restaurants in this small town with pleasant wait staff and better than soup kitchen food! Much rather support them especially in the slower months of year when business is slow! Sadly I left hungry and our waiter didn't care enough to notice there was a problem with anything! You'd think the full plates of food on the table would have been a clue!!!"}
{"text":"I think they have great service.  My husband had an omelet & it was very good. My friend & I both had the biscuits & gravy.  The biscuit was good, but it was probably the worst gravy we have ever tasted. No flavor or spices & not sure what kind of sausage they used ...very strange looking & tasting."}
{"text":"Best service and food in the town of fountain hills. Always a good place to go and have just a couple drinks and go walk around the park! Only restaurant I'll go too!"}
{"text":"A very nice place with a great view. I stopped for breakfast and they have a wonderful selection. The service was great, servers were friendly."}
{"text":"great variety of food & very personable staff. 

Love the location too.
very nice place to visit if you're in the area!
will be back to eat again.
=)"}
{"text":"On our final morning in Fountain Hills, we decided to try Phil's for breakfast. I'm now wishing we'd gone back to Sofrita. 

The decor here is fun -- 50s Coca-Cola-themed -- with all the oldies playing at a volume you can hear but that's not annoying. Unfortunately, this was all punctuated by the frequent, phlegmy throat clearing of Phil. This is not a sound you want to hear while you're eating a meal.

The waitress was friendly and the service was fairly quick. 

The food? 

My husband's pancakes were fine but nothing special. They came with a bowl of the standard fruit salad of melon and berries.

My breakfast, however, was less than \"nothing special.\" My Mexican omelette was ... meh ... OK. It was dry and required a good dousing of ketchup. The \"home fries,\" however, were NOT good. They were not fried. Instead, I got a serving of thinly sliced potatoes that were warmed in a pan with what looked like a sprinkling of paprika and a few pieces of bell peppers. They had no flavor and none of those wonderful crispy brown parts that you expect to get with an order of home fries. The waitress that was serving the other tables (i.e., not our waitress) told the other patrons that the cook was trying out a \"new way\" of cooking the potatoes and wanted to know how her customers liked them. They didn't ask me, unfortunately. I would have politely commented that perhaps they need to go back to the old way.

The best part of my breakfast was the marble rye toast.

I'm afraid I can't recommend Phil's for breakfast. Lunch and dinner may be better, but we're leaving today. If we're ever back in Fountain Hills again, we might give Phil another chance to serve us a meal, but it won't be breakfast."}
{"text":"My family and I are long time regulars at Phil's. We've lived in FH for 21 years and seen a lot of restaurants come and go.  Phil's consistently has provided us great food and drink year after year.

I am a big fan of the soups, they are extremely flavorful and made from scratch. The burgers are great and I can't find a better place for them in the entire east valley.  If you're a french fry fan, you'll love the various types that Phil's offers.  My favorites are the sandwiches, I often even order them for dinner.

When asked where to go to eat in FH, Phil's is at the top of our list!"}
{"text":"Excellent Brunch & Service! Great place for lunch and catching up w old friends. Glad that Phils is still a staple in town!"}
{"text":"Luv the atmosphere, great setting for breakfast or lunch, cozy, homey.

Had coffee, 2 eggs with a burger, toast, potatoes.

Coffee, eggs, toast unremarkable, potatoes...why bother putting them on the plate?, burger good,  Other than the atmosphere, I'd search for a better breakfast elsewhere, but atmosphere may be worth it if average is ok for you.

I should mention the person serving my table, was superb."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place. Best breakfast in the area. Parents were in town and we went there pretty much everyday for breakfast. Foods is really good and the staff are the best."}
{"text":"Had a mediocre breakfast with pleasant service, nice atmosphere, and really lousy coffee.  They tried to accommodate me with a second cup of fake expresso.  Meal was over priced but the food came out in a flash.  To recap, cute diner, fast friendly service, lousy coffee, uninspired food.  I wish someone would open a good restaurant in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Phils! Usually go later in the evening 7-9 pm. Sit in the bar area. Never had a complaint with service! Exceptional service! Gf and I went tonight and she ordered a simple chicken sandwich. I on the other hand ordered the Clam Sauce dish w/ fettuccine. Comes with a dinner salad and a good size piece of bread with the meal. The clams! Generous amount and not puny size! Was very impressed and thanked the chef personally. 36.00 at the end and well worth it."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the service can be really hit or miss. Sometimes it's great, sometimes you have to flag someone down to place a drink order. The food is your standard diner food, I recommend going for breakfast. Prices are not too bad and you get a large portion. I normally end up needing a box. 

The decor makes this place fun. Coca Cola themed throughout. A great nostalgic place for parents or grandparents.

They do a lot of fundraising for shelter and service dogs during Christmas time too, which endears it to me even more."}
{"text":"I am not really sure what to say here. While the decor is very interesting with a very nice Coca-Cola theme... The food is a complete disaster.

Honestly it was the worst food I have ever had in all of Arizona. They put processed American cheese on a Philly cheesesteak.

They charged nine dollars for a petite hamburger that was overcooked and with low quality ingredients. 

You have a lot better choices in fountain Hills. I would not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"I've been a resident of Fountain Hills for 6+ years now and LOVE my 'hood dearly. With the economy shifting around and such, I'm seeing more and more businesses leave our town. This saddens me. It really does, so I do my best to support both privately-owned (mom & pop-sized) businesses as well as large, commercial chains in FH. This is why I'm rooting for Phil's and giving them a plug via Yelp. 

Phil's (I do believe) has been around for awhile and I want them to stay put. Is it gourmet and glamorous for the highly-scrutinzing foodie? No. It's not. But they offer ample seating with plenty of Coca-Cola memorabilia to fixate on while you're dining. Their walls are completely adorned with this eternal, high-sugared soda pop.

And, the food? It's decent. I'd say perhaps a step above your local Denny's or IHOP? Service was pretty good and prices are a smidge high, IMO. But, maybe they need to inflate pricing to stay put in our little town? I get it. :)"}
{"text":"They got a one star from me because not only did they mess up my order.... But when they fixed it finally the other three people I was with were more than half done with their meal! Terrible service! In my opinion...   stay away... Go somewhere where they appreciate clients"}
{"text":"Lots of potential for this to be a hip diner with amazing down-home greasy and delicious diner food. But...doesn't quite cut it. Menu is huge - lots of options, I'll give 'em that. However, the execution is lacking. I got a philly cheesesteak (maybe that was my bad to order that in Arizona) , which is not THAT hard to mess up, but I pretty much got chunks of diced beef on bread with grilled vegetables thrown on top and then cheese that was semi-melted over it. Nothing oozed together, at all. 

Other dishes my friends got didn't look very appetizing either. Sorry Phil, gotta step up your filling station game."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Never, ever order the potato  skins. 10 bucks for (4)  rather pathetic and meager examples of how to Fail at creating a happy customer experience.  Voiced  my perspective and the owner just shrugged.  obviously he  is a master of customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Disappointed.

We went for dinner but the service was so bizarre at the bar, we ended up leaving before we ordered."}
{"text":"If you have nothing better to do with your time than wait. It took over an hour to get our food. When it came many things were not right. Stuffed jalapeño burger was a joke like 3 pieces of jalapeño and minuscule amount of cheese. The salad dressings tasted like the cheapest brand ever made. The ice tea was so watered down I'm not sure it was tea. The cups were dirty ( old sugar packets stuck in the bottom) owner did Comp the meal (as he should have) saying they were so busy we got lost in the shuffle, it's always like this on Sunday(then staff up, trim down the menu, pre prep more of what you use. Probably won't be back - to many other places to try or return to that are better."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch today.
Hubs ordered the Po'Boy - its their own little take on it. It comes avocado, diced tomatoes, and lime Mayo. He said the lime Mayo was really good. The sandwich itself was average but he was quite pleased with the lime Mayo. The bread was fresh and good, I believe that he deferred to it as a baguette. His side was Cajun Fries, which enjoyed - said they had flavor but not a \"kick\" like you'd expect from something labeled Cajun. He'd ordered both the fries and sandwich again.

I ordered their Turkey Reuben. It was the traditional Reuben, sauerkraut and Thousand Island Dressing on Marble Rye bread. The bread was fresh and tasty, the Turkey seemed a little dry but had good taste. All in all, the sandwich was good but probably not something I'd ordered again ( we have a place in town that does a better Turkey Reuben). The fries were good and the serving size was perfect.
(PS - I love pickles with my sandwich and they do have one, it was average)

I know I mentioned that this place is adorable before, but worth mentioning again. Seriously, diner adorable with a Coca Cola twist. Every wall had Come memorabilia, puzzles, pictures, ads, old bottles, even their fans are Come. Gotta give it to them for knowing their target market, the older folks that have been to actual diners back when they were cool and in. 

Definitely will go back - there's still like 2 million things in their menu that we've not tried yet.

I'll note that I did lower the score from 4 to 3 stars today, I decided to use their restroom. It was clean, don't get me wrong. The turn off is that it's out the back door, passed the kitchen door - at first that seems like it's a good idea because it's called Phil's Filling Station, and gas stations always had them out doors. Right?!! But the employees sit out back and smoke. Right outside of the dining room door. Gal was out there smoking. Major turn off. I probably won't be using that restroom again."}
{"text":"Great place to dine. Coke memorabilia a plenty and GREAT Music...
Service wonderful. Meal was Dyno-Mite"}
{"text":"If you love coke memorabilia and decor this is a place to see. The food is good but over priced for the quality. Basic breakfast for two will run you around $25.00"}
{"text":"We went here a few years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was excited to go back, but was very disappointed this time around. 
The menu is huge, but nothing really special. Our food was just okay, not great, not horrible."}
{"text":"Well, the menu is big lots of selections, but the hey...I would refrain from ever getting any of the salads as they are made with ice berg lettuce which is not the best lettuce to eat and has basically no nutrition value but hey it is the cheapest you can buy. Also for the appetizers they are not worth the price ..we got the veggies it was a small plate of veggies with some ranch dressing in a container, they forgot to give us the pita squares and very small plate of veggies and they sell it for $9...do not order...also all the appetizers we had were over prized and not enough for two people except the mussels if you order the mussels you get about 16 of them which is a good...for the rest of the meal hey...they are overpriced on everything, they buy inexpensive food and sell it at a high price to make a profit...wish they had better quality food.  avoid the salads...the burgers were just okay nothing to write home about.  the desserts were just okay nothing to write home about....just okay everything was just okay....nothing amazing"}
{"text":"Food is greasy and crappy, not to mention over priced; owner is a dick who acts like he is paying you to be there. I've seen him argue with countless customers. Many better places to try in fountain hills then this dump."}
{"text":"We went to Phil's based on reviews we read and are glad we did. I must say that I was skeptical - with SO many items on the menu, it was difficult to believe that they could do them all well. They did our two items very well: the Sonoran turkey sandwich and the stir fry chicken salad. If they can do two that are that much different well, I won't worry next time. And, there will be a next time as we already have plans to go back for breakfast. This is an amazingly charming \"diner\" place with friendly and efficient staff that is well worth the short drive for anyone visiting the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Maybe 3 1/2 stars is more accurate, but I DID enjoy the food here.  It's a diner, with an extensive Coca-Cola theme throughout the whole place.  Good diner food--the breakfast I had here was tasty and filling.  I'm looking forward to trying one of their hotdogs here sometime.

A few criticisms:

One, PLEASE clean your grill.  My wife was trying to enjoy her breakfast of corned beef hash and eggs, and she kept tasting what seemed to her to be liver and onions.  I could also taste something residual on the food myself, although it wasn't as bothersome to me.  It was noticeable though.

Two, more important, what is up with your bathroom situation?  I understand that your bathrooms are \"outside, to the left\", but your description of \"clean\" isn't super accurate.  First, you have to walk around jumbled boxes and trash outside to even get to the doors.  Then, the interior is a bit. . .dingy.  It wasn't the worst bathroom I've seen by a long shot, but little black bits of ??? on the floor and a strong urine smell did not give me a lot of confidence about the cleanliness of the place.

I really don't want to be too harsh here--service was great, food was great, ambiance was entertaining, but that bathroom. . .  I think I'm still getting flashbacks to that pizza place in California where people were using the soap dispenser as an ashtray.  This place wasn't as bad, but there's room for improvement.

Overall, I'm a fan. . .of the FRONT of the restaurant, not the back."}
{"text":"They have everything. All American menu, plus breakfast and pasta and pizza and burgers."}
{"text":"Fast service. Friendly. Consistently good food. Reasonable prices. What more could you ask of a diner."}
{"text":"Husband and myself just shared Monster Lasagna (takeout). It was fabulous!  Just like homemade!  In general, everything we've had here at Phil's was delish, including the Reuben, burgers, omelets...it's like an old fashioned NYC diner - unpretentious with the same great homey food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch... the place looks ok if you're a hillbilly and dating your cousin but the food was not bad.  I ordered their 1/2 pound burger, burger was cooked perfect but it came with this huge bun that was a little dry, I actually enjoyed the fries more than the burger. Service was slow at first but they got better. Overall...probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Expansive menu.  Great for adults,  kids and picky eaters.  Salads,  pizza,  hamburgers, sandwiches..... and so on. 3 picky eaters that enjoyed the burgers."}
{"text":"One of the better reviews I've ever read advised the reader never to trust either 1-star or 5-star reviews.  I can agree with that.  It's rare that I read a 1-star review that doesn't complain about something that has nothing to do with the subject or is full of false information, or a 5-star review that doesn't sound like it was written by the business owner's mother.

Sticking to that I thinking Phil's Filling Station earns an \"I like it\" positive rating of 4-stars.  The food isn't spectacular but not bad either.  The décor is touristy and perhaps a bit overdone.  And the prices are mysteriously high considering the quantity and quality of the food and the restaurant's location.

My visit was for breakfast and I ordered French Toast with bacon.  Granted it would be very hard to screw up French Toast and they didn't. It wasn't spectacular but it was good.  The bacon was very thick slices that had a better than average flavor. As an add-on to the French Toast order they were a $2 for 3 pieces of bacon.  They only negative was they should have patted the bacon dry with a paper towel ... there was too much grease on them as served.

My dining companion had the Italian omelet, which I didn't taste but it looked good. But it was way overpriced compared to what you would get at similar restaurants.

The Coca-Cola theme of the interior reminded me of Cracker Barrel ... cute, kitschy and with their fondness for Coke logos to be more of an obsession than a theme.

The layout is split equally down the middle ... restaurant on one side and bar on the other with a Cracker Barrel style register counter in the middle.  I've mentioned Cracker Barrel twice already and the comparison of the two is inevitable, down to the plethora of merchandise for sale.

What likely boosted Phil's star rating up the most was the service.  Not only our order but all of the tables around us were served promptly, with an average of about 5 minutes wait time.  Our server was Cheyenne who was friendly, helpful, and courteous and had an excellent sense of 
timing.  She's probably the #1 reason I would come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible frozen crap. The waitress/bartender told us the food was horrible frozen crap. I should've ran right at that moment. She was understating the fact."}
{"text":"Many points for scope of their menu,  which rivals a Greek diner. More points for decent cooking properly done to Oder. The staff are young and friendly, the memorabilia are fun with emphasis onCoke, certainly not gourmet dining, but the servings are good size and the ingredients are fresh. 

Sadly, the bathroom situation is deplorable. One bathroom for such a large and busy place. Worse, it is not kept as clean as it should be. Worst, it is not designed hot handicapped or older users."}
{"text":"Good food & reasonably priced! Wish the service was a tad bit faster... But I guess as busy as they can be, another 5 minutes won't kill me! I still need to explore and try many other  dishes on the menu but so far those that I have experienced are very good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Phil's on many Sundays as we drive our 68 Corvette there for the cruise-in on that day.  The breakfast is always great!  I would advise that you try the eggs and schnitzel!  I encourage all to join us from October - May on Sunday mid-day to gaze at 100 + antique and collector cars and enjoy a Bloody Mary with brunch!!"}
{"text":"The most disappointing place I've ever been to.  I was seated quite quickly, and was handed a menu.  Waited for 10 minutes for a  waitress to take my drink order, by that time I all ready figured what I wanted from a massive menu.  Half order of mozzarella sticks and a french dip with fries.  

10 minutes go by, finally get my drink, another 20 minutes  a different waitress comes by and said that my food should be up in a few minutes.  I watched a few people be seated and get their food, while I just waited.  Listened to \"Phil\", who looks like he stepped out of some sleazy strip joint, yell at all the waitresses that \" NO ONE IS TO SEAT ANY PARTY BUT HIM\". 

Another 10 minutes, so now we're at 40 minutes waiting for my food, I ask another waitress how much for my drink, she asked why?  I told her I was tired of waiting and I was leaving... well I got my iced green tea for free, the only good thing that happened!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Service was fast and they were very accommodating. The waitress asked, what do you want, we can make it happen?!!  The food was very good.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Phil's is a Fountain Hills staple.  It is our go to place when friends and family come to town.  To say the menu is extensive is an understatement.  There is something for everyone at Phil's which is why it's so great for big parties.  Phil is a great guy, the atmosphere is fun, and food and service are consistent.  That is why we will keep going back."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Great bloody Mary's! Biker friendly and a car show every Sunday! How does it get any better? Oh 12 big screens with football that I can see from my bar stool! This will definitely be a regular stop on Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"I'd agree with the other reviews that their servers are great. The gal who waited on us was wonderful. However, I don't know if it was the owner or GM, but the guy working the front (run/tan complexion with thinning black slicked-back hair) was a jerk. He was so rude I thought it might have been part of a joke or something. I kept looking around to see if I was on a game show. Nope. Not sure who this guy was, but between him and the decor, we won't go back."}
