{"text":"Good south Indian food. Good portions with quality food. Hope it continues to maintain the quality. Glad Chennai chettinaad has some competition now"}
{"text":"Just tried this place right next to Walmart  from 1-10 this place is a 11 super Delicious flavor ! I Highly recommend stopping in and trying it lunch buffet is amazing"}
{"text":"Yelp and their website says they're open. We came at 12:11 PM and they're closed. This is just poor business practice. I shall not consider this place to bring guests because of their unreliability. Not sure if the food makes up for this crap."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of South Indian food including dosa, desert and tea served at lunch.

Nice modern ambiance and big windows to let light in.

Service was also very good.

Hope this place is consistent as it will do very well."}
{"text":"This is difficult to give them 2 stars. The food was really tasty, so many choices, and everything was clean. My issue with the place is purely customer service. They told us the wrong time over the phone, waited 30 mins, once they opened we waited an additional 30 mins inside for them to prepare the food and such. We were never asked if we wanted any special drinks and mean while a couple employees were sat in the back texting. Oh, i had to fetch a highchair for my daughter because i was never asked if we needed one. Purely off of food, they deserve 5 stars, but customer service goes a very long way. We will stick with the Indian Palace. The food is extremely good but the kindness they have there exceeds any other buffet."}
{"text":"Good place to have authentic South Indian foods with reasonable price.restaurant staff was friendly.it was good place!"}
{"text":"We were so excited when this place had  opened.   We went there for the buffet and it was AMAZING.  The place is clean, owners are welcoming and the waitress is very friendly, too.

They were prompt when taking our used dishes away,  which is a big must for me when I go to buffets. 

Highly recommend this place. Definitely our new go-to Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the lunch buffet. Probably the best tandoori chicken in the valley, the chicken tikka masal was also very  good. Great variety of food, I did not try everything but will next time. The only black mark was the smell from the bathrooms, hopefully they will get that fixed. People were friendly and the price was around $21 for two including tax."}
{"text":"I could vouch for the authenticity of the food. The spread for the buffet was amazing they had 6 veg and non vegetarian dishes. Their desserts are one of a kind in AZ they had laddu, mysorepak etc. This is probably the only place serving thalapakattu biriyani in Phoenix..great experience..will try again"}
{"text":"I am giving them one star for the service and the inability to eat the food - literally!

My husband and I went there on a Sunday. The buffet line goes right past the front door so it was hard to get in in the first place but we made it past the line then stood there waiting. No one acknowledged us for 10 minutes and then a woman (who I assume works there) walked up to us and told us the wait was 30 minutes and we would be better off coming back another time.

Ok. I wasn't happy about it but we decided to try again later. I made plans to meet my husband there after work on a Friday. Their website says they open at 5:30 on Friday night. We got there at 5:50 and walked in and a woman cleaning tables told us we would ha e to come back in 5 to 10 minutes. Really???

If you don't open until 6 then update your website to reflect the correct time! I was annoyed but would have been willing to wait the 10 minutes (glutton for punishment?) but my husband decided he was done with the place; especially since they weren't even really nice about it...

I know everyone seems to be giving this place great reviews and good for them, but be forewarned you might want to call ahead to see if you will actually be able to be seated!!!"}
{"text":"The best and authentic south Indian food in Phoenix. Really consistent taste and great buffet spread whenever I visited.
Spiciness/hotness levels were perfect that wouldn't put you down after a heavy meal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and price. My two girls and I went for the lunch buffet today and enjoyed ourselves.

We liked the simple and stylish decor. The restaurant staff was friendly and hospitable. We were shown to our tables and then invited to begin feasting.

Desserts were displayed first: gulab jamun (fried balls of dough that soaked up a honey sweet syrup), a sweet rice soup dessert, a couple of fried desserts and cookies. 

Appetizers: They offered my favorite lentil vada  and small triangles of papadam (savory fried crisps). 

Soup: They had a rasam (spicy sour soup) and a vegetable soup. Both were tasty.

Vegetarian dishes never tasted so good: I liked their paneer (cheese) tikka masala, vegetable (cauliflower) korma, vegetable bhiryani (spiced rice), dhal (lentil soup)basmati rice.

Breads: Naan and spongy crumpet-like bread was offered.

Meat dishes: Tandoori chicken (flavorful marinate), chicken tikka masala (oh, the sauce was so creamy), mutton bhiryani (mutton was super tender), chili fried chicken (robust sauce), and chicken curry.

They also served yoghurt based sauces on the side.

Props to the chefs at Chennai Cafe. Every curry offered a distinct and delicious flavor. Chefs are south Indian. For the buffet, they turn down the heat level. I enjoyed the variety of dishes and all for the grand price of $10."}
{"text":"Saw this place pop up on Yelp and had to try it out. I love Indian food. When you walk in you will find a large open restaurant. The cups and dishes are very traditional of an Indian restaurant. There is a large array of items on their menu. They have vegetation and non-vegetation options. When we went to put an order in to go they offered water and gave us a small desert to try while we waited for our food. It was so good!

The service here is amazing. Everyone does a great job. They really make you feel at home when you come in.

There is a ton of parking right out front. No need to park far away.

I want to try everything on the menu! The sauces that you get with your food are good as well. They really complement the dishes. 

I recommend everyone come try this place out. They have amazing authentic food that you will love!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. I missed the Indian restaurant that was there years ago. My mother and I went for Christmas Day and the buffet was huge and amazing so I am not sure if it is like that every day. The food was delicious. It is too bad they do not have buffet for dinner as well. 
Friendly staff and clean environment will go again"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.... We just found our number one Indian restaurant in Arizona, you gotta try this South Indian buffet if you are craving for authentic Indian food. Dal was cooked to perfection. Loved the Veggie Biryani and Pongal (Indian porridge). Great selections of vegetarian dishes. On the other hand, they also serve non-vegetarian choices, like chicken curry, chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, fried anchovies fish, goat curry. They also have unlimited Chai Tea and Mango Lassi on tap. Bottom line is, when you see most of the customers are Indians, you know they served authentic Indian food.
Great service and lots of seats. Ambiance is Clean and simple."}
{"text":"The chilli chicken is the best I've ever had and I had been to many Indian restaurants across the US.  It was moist, spicy and fresh. The service was personal and friendly. The buffet also has a great selection of dishes from South India. The chef at this place is very talented!"}
{"text":"I used to like there food but they seem to have changed the chef . I normally don't give bad reviews but this time i had to. I ordered Chole bhature from them. They reduced the size of the bhatura to almost half the size it used to be but the price for it remains the same. And the bhatura felt almost like eating chips. The chole were terrible. Had upset stomach after eating. I would never order from them again."}
{"text":"The place was empty but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. The food was very good, the variety excellent (I was there for a lunch buffet), food was not too greasy, not too salty, very nice. Some of the dishes that were offered I've never seen in other Indian restaurants. Overall a very satisfying experience although I'm not so sure that metal cups for hot chai is such a good choice, but that's pretty much my only gripe."}
{"text":"This place is packed, especially with local Indian families, for good reason! There is a nice selection of curries, desserts, and a fresh rice flour pancake station (idk what it's actually called). Everyone is friendly and willing to educate you on the items. Just be prepared to wait about 20 minutes for that delicious buffet lunch. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic South Indian which is not too heavy. It has home food feel. The kormas are awesome. The service is great. Gotta love the paneer- it is absolutely amazing - kudos to the chef.
The buffet also has some special bonuses.
Please go and enjoy the great food- You will be supporting an authentic Indian restaurant.

{"text":"Chennai Cafe by day serves a very reasonably priced South Indian Buffet  that includes many vegetarian offerings and about six meat offerings that are mostly chicken on the bone (one mutton dish on the day I was there). They also offer many Indian desserts. For dinner they offer a menu.

On my visit someone showed us to a table and then they gave us a pitcher of water. The tables are set with metal cups on a tray. I don't think they have any other beverage ( I could be wrong about that but we weren't offered any other beverage and I didn't see any beverages in site)

We helped ourselves to the buffet. It was a little different than other Indian Buffets I've been too. The naan bread was on the buffet. I thought the majority of what I tried was very good. Some things I liked from here more than from the other South Indian Buffet. Most of the chicken was moist and very flavorful.  We both thought the vegetarian biryani was much more delicious than the chicken biryani.

Nobody asked us how everything was. Actually nobody made any conversation with us and when we were done we just walked up to pay.

I do fear posting a positive review on one buffet experience because it's a known fact that buffets can differ by the hour.

In the end we were very pleased with the food and plan to return."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great staff! Fast n friendly... food is absolutely outstanding. I am a Punjabi from North India so I know my North Indian food. I also have spent a lot of time in the South India so I know my South Indian food."}
{"text":"Super great!!!!!! The best indian food in this part of town.Make sure you bring friends or relatives, youll be talking about this experience for a long time."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Indian restaurant in this area. Everything in buffet is fresh and authentic. Come here for buffet, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely a giant fan of this place! I went in on a random weeknight and ended up ordering way more food than I could possibly eat in one sitting, partly because I'm a total glutton, but also because the portion sizes ended up being much larger than anticipated. 

I ordered the gobi manchurian, paneer tikka masala, garlic naan, biryani, and madras coffee. Don't worry, I did share with a friend. However, the portions (esp the biryani) were so big that we had a ton of food in to go boxes and enjoyed it all at later meals. Now in terms of taste, all of the food was really really good. The gobi manchurian was absolutely delicious -- the sauce had the right amount of spice and the cauliflower was nice and crispy on the outside. The paneer tikka masala, which comes with a side of rice, went super well the garlic naan. The biryani was great, according to my friend, and the madras coffee packed a nice punch.

The timings for this place have been a bit wishy washy since I last visited, but I'm hoping they open up again with regular hours so that I can go back and try the weekend buffet!

My only advice would be to provide the wait staff with more training! The servers and bussers seemed to be really lost and needed a lot of guidance to put in even simple orders."}
{"text":"This place has re-opened. We stumbled upon this place as open while going across. Decided to go in to try. This place is under new management. 
We ordered north indian food. It was unexpectedly amazing mughlai chicken curry and garlic naan. Very fragrant curry and garlic naan was one of the very best. 

This place is open and deserves a visit!!"}
{"text":"We ate here recently; I was craving Indian food one evening and when I saw a new place just opened and it was highly rated I had to check it out. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! It is a simply decorated interior (please don't fill the place with tacky cheap looking decorations, keep it clean and modern). We came for dinner, so there was no buffet, but I have to come back to try it. I honestly wasn't sure what to order, so the waitress made a recommendation for me. My only request was that it be chicken with no bones; the dish she recommended traditionally comes with bones, but they happily switched it out for boneless white meat. Seriously, this place was wonderful. The food was excellent, the service great, it's clean, simple, and straightforward. The staff were amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"South Indian food was good.   The young lady that takes the orders is very slow and does not have good customer skills."}
{"text":"Great food. Buffet was of a high quality and a good variety too. It reflected in the taste and attitude of owners in welcoming everyone."}
{"text":"Great experience here. My mom and I went for lunch. She's from Malaysia, so she grew up with a lot of South Indian food. Unfortunately, we don't always find a good place to go until now. 

The service was really nice and friendly. The food was delicious. It was full of spices and just amazing. We got the lunch special, which came with several small bowls of the different curries. I can't remember the name, but there was a poster for it in the window on the way in. It came with a small banana and a large bowl of rice. I couldn't pick my favorite.

We also had the samosas, which were lovely and crunchy. The chutney was sweet and spicy; just perfect. The spices in the special biryani rice was also amazing. It wasn't overwhelming, rather the most fragrant and tasty I had in a long time.

I really feel like the only reason you won't like this restaurant is if you don't like tasty, flavorful food."}
{"text":"We ordered food for our party. Food was tasted really good and everyone at the party enjoyed and liked the food. There were lot of options to choose from and based on the count they delivered it. I assume this is best restaurant if you are looking for traditional South Indian food.. Keep up the great taste and great customer service.. Definitely recommend for party orders.."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review as I've eaten here a few times now and every time I go, I am more disappointed.  What started out as amazing is getting worse with each visit.  What happened to the dosa served at the table?  Another recent time, we were seated for the buffet, but never given water...AND we had to wait for at least 15 minutes for plates and silverware to be replenished at the buffet.  Plates finally arrive, but they're the tiny dessert plates.  Was told to wait even longer for large plates.  Next time - no napkins anywhere..had to walk over to the busser's area to grab some out of the package and was given a blank stare from an employee.  Asked for tamarind and/or mint chutney and was also given a look like I was from another planet and told that those chutneys only go on pakoras. Since when?? Yesterday they had a gentleman cooking something near the desserts.  I asked what it was and he just pointed to the sign.  Uhm yes, I can read, but I still don't know what it is. It's by the sweets, so I ask - is it a dessert?  All he says is no. This is no longer at top of mind when it comes to Indian food. I'm sure they are short staffed and overwhelmed (at least that's the feeling I get when I go) but I want that amazing first-time visit experience!"}
{"text":"We have tried Indian restaurants all over the valley, Chennai Cafe has them all beat.

+Welcoming atmosphere, staff is friendly and smiling, furniture is nice.

+Large selection and wide variety of food. There is something for everyone, however I would like to see tags that alert you to vegetarian or gluten free dishes.

+Went during the buffet and tried one of everything, I wasn't dissapointed by anything. Even plates I've had before elsewhere tasted new to me, they were that great.

+mango lassi (not included) and tea (included) were delicious and they had quite the spread for dessert. We were told they offer even more of a selection on weekends.

-I'll be returning here soon for sure, only thing I would like to see, or rather hear, is music playing in the background. Calm and zen sitar really brings a meal like this together. This place just opened up though so I'm sure the little things like this are on the way."}
{"text":"We got here a little past 1pm and it was quiet. We came for the crab masala. They were good in refilling the buffet but since that's all I ate (crabs) I feel like one of the kitchen staff's eyes was on me. 
This is the only Indian buffet that serves crab masala. Overall it was good except for the prying eyes."}
{"text":"Great authentic South Indian  food, loved the ghee roast and chicken kottu porrota. Tea was great as well. Sambhar and chutneys were good too. Definitely recommend the place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"We ordered veg samosas (menu said 2 pieces but they gave us 3!), saag paneer, dahl, and fried rice with gobi manchurian (recommended by the very nice waitress). Every dish came with rice and we ordered naan on the side. All dishes were 10/10 delicious! The gobi manchurian was the best cauliflower we've ever had.
The prices are very good and the portions are generous.
We only eat at restaurants about twice a month but we will definitely be back. It is easy to find and there is plenty of parking since it is in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Was mostly impressed with the service; a real family feel.  I would recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"We are always looking for good Indian food in our area and although many new ones are popping up none have really hit the spot. Chennai is in the better than most but didn't blow my socks off category.  Plenty of options for meat and non meat dishes, nice spice levels, great flavors, clean space, decent service, prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants in the area. My biggest praise is for the fact that they have Jelebi (probably spelled wrong), which is really the only Indian sweet I care for. I would definitely recommend Chennai at least for the buffet, have not gone any other time."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving it a 5 Star is because I've had slightly better chicken tikka masala. Either way I would recommend it, very delicious and location is convenient for me."}
{"text":"My first visit here was on Tues. At first I was hesitant because it was in a strip mall and seemed empty inside. I'm so glad I went in because the food was awesome. So much flavor and really good size portions. My only wish was that the menu had a description in English of what everything was."}
{"text":"A little gem hidden with all these shops around! Brand new- we were the only ones there at first. We prefer the buffet because we love so many types of food but everything we ordered was delicious. We ordered waaaay too much food for just the two of us. We took a lot home. We ordered the vegetable biryani, saag paneer, lamb Marsala, aloo gobi and of course garlic naan. They served all that with white rice and because we were hungry we had ordered the vegetable pokora to start and it was a huge plate full! So keep that in mind if you are feeding just two people and don't like leftovers. Excellent food, beautiful presentation. We will be back for sure. Pic is of the huge plate of vegetable biryani. One last thing is this place has a ton of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chennai Indian food. 
Tasteful, affordable, and friendly staff. 
We will come back again."}
{"text":"Just finished the lunch buffet. Wow, I was impressed. I have had dinner, take out, and now the buffet. You get the same quality and product as the dinners, just a heck of alot more. When we left at 1:00, there were several parties waiting to be seated. I'm not pointing that out as a complaint, but the food there is that good. They had goat! Goat I tell you! At a buffet!"}
{"text":"Great food, ambience and service. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the area (coming from a native Indian, that says something ;))"}
{"text":"Just went to Chennai Cafe for the first time. It was excellent! We had the onion pakora, vegetable kottu parotha, vegetable stir fry rice, paper roast masala dosai. All the food was great. The restaurant had an authentic South Indian feel aside from the lack of Tamil music. The portions were generous and the pricing was reasonable. Will definitely go back to the restaurant and rate it highly."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian buffers I've been to. The location is not what you'd expect for a place like this (between a Walmart and furniture store), but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in here for the first time. You pick a table, then go ahead and get food from the buffet (pay later). The entire wall on the right side is full of vegetarian options, soups, and deserts to choose from. On the other end (at the wall near the kitchen), you have different meat dishes to choose from. To be honest I didn't know what most of the food was, but I took a small helping of most things to try them out; I was not disappointed with anything! All the food was very fresh, authentic, and there was a LOT to choose from (maybe 20 or more different items overall). The owners are also very friendly and it's clear they care about the food they prepare and their customers. One time I got here a little early and some of the dishes weren't ready yet, so we were given a to-go box to take a serving home to have later. 

I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking to have Indian food in the area. They aren't too busy on weekdays, but the one time I was here on the weekend it was PACKED with a constant line for the buffet and all the tables were taken; they also have a few more (as if they don't already have enough!) items available to choose from on the weekend."}
{"text":"Good place to visit for authentic south indian food... Quality and Quantity is maintained... I love the coffee over there... Idli , pongal and chicken starters which I ordered where reached my expectations"}
{"text":"If you have not tired Indian food before, this is a great place to start. Absolutely delicious! My wife and I have tried a number of Indian buffet restaurants before but this is now my favorite. 

I am not overly familiar with Indian food but the staff and other patrons were more than willing to explain how the food is suppose to be eaten."}
{"text":"Good South Indian food with authentic mutton gravy.dosas are good.need a lot of improvements in briyani....

New one after a month-- Taste degrading with high rate..time to do a reality check on your quality and taste ."}
{"text":"came to the buffet for my first time. i was very surprised at the food. so many different dishes and flavors. the buffet was like 10 bucks. and i tried so many different things. my faves were the paneer and chicken tikka masala abd the rice. we also enjoyed the kheer dessert. i didnt give 5 stars becasue the sodas were the single cans instead of regular and free refills. overall a good experience and will be back to try other dishes a la carte"}
{"text":"Very good Indian buffet.  Full of flavor, lots of options to choose from.  Very clean if a bit sparse on decor.  Could have used some music on the background.  Also was offered nothing but the water on the table for a beverage.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Highly recommend the Dosa and Tika Masala. They keep food a little more mild with regards to spiciness - make sure to ask to add extra :) will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally a great Indian restaurant in the West Valley. Lunch buffet selection had the largest selection of great foods and deserts we have seen. Can't wait to go back for dinner. Large restaurant with colorful interior. Plenty of food so come hungry!"}
