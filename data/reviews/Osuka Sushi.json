{"text":"We've ordered from this place a few times before. As a Vancouverite, I adore sushi and this place is pretty good for taste, but recently we ordered delivery and was pretty disappointed. I live two blocks away, and I ordered sushi while I studied, thinking the food could be delivered quickly. An hour and a half later and still no food. I called and they told me the delivery driver was out on another delivery.  I wondered why one of the employees couldn't walk it over themselves...or why they couldn't have delivered it sooner. My order wasn't large or complicated. I would've gotten take out if I knew it would've taken less time!
When it finally arrived, 1.45hrs later, the cold sushi was warm and and the warm sushi was room-temp and mushy. One of the rolls had fried fish in it, and it really wasn't tasty cold. I had asked for no tobiko on anything and yet everything still had fish eggs all over. 
As for price, it's decent for Montreal standards. $3 for a cucumber roll, $10 for sushi pizza, $5/6 for regular rolls like Kamikaze or Vancouver roll.
Would I eat here again? Maybe, if I'm desperate for delivered sushi. But I'll keep my expectations low and order two hours before I'm actually hungry."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Amazing sushi.  Very fresh fish, and lots of fish in the rolls. Just a bit of rice (not mostly rice). They probably make the hot sauce here - it has a richness of flavours you don't get in the plastic tube hot sauce most places use.  Just delicious 2-piece spicy scallop - like a ceviche, almost. Highly recommended for the high quality of sushi, and friendly service."}
{"text":"We ordered for take out. First of all, they were very rude on the phone, not wanting to read back our order, but we no big deal. When we got back, I ate my smoked salmon sushi, and it tasted awful, the fish had clearly gone bad. I called them to let them know, and they told me I probably just don't like salmon. I've been eating salmon sushi for years! If they had at least apologized, it wouldn't have made it as bad. All in all, never going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE sushi. I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life, at a lot of different types of sushi places...from getting it at a grocery store to eating at Kaizen, one of the more expensive places for sushi in Montreal, and has some of the freshest, most buttery fish I've had in the city. Osuka's fish is really really top notch. The restaurant itself has only a couple of tables and the sushi counter. It's really meant more for take out and delivery. They have a pretty average menu, what you'd expect, nothing fancy, but they get the full 5 stars for the quality of fish. Really nice and melty. They also have some chef specialties that are quite good. They deliver for free and give you different free rolls depending on how much you order. The other reason they get the full five stars is for the prices. Very very reasonable for the quality: 5.75 for a spicy tuna roll, 6.50 for a kamikaze, 7.95 for one of their specialty rolls. For 50$, you and your dinner date can stuff your faces and still have a bit for lunch tomorrow (unless you're like me and enjoy sushi midnight snacks)."}
{"text":"Basically if you enjoy fried sushi this is the place today! Sushi portions are abnormally large so that one can't manage to fit it into their mouth and they are extremely poorly wrapped to the point the sushi doesn't even make it to your mouth before falling apart! Don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Not bad. They take a long time to prepare the food, but it's good (not great). I've been there a couple of times, had only rolls. A bit disappointed because they didn't have a couple of things I wanted, and their water tastes really strange so if you want to eat there, you'll have to purchase a drink. They don't have tea, which is really weird to me."}
{"text":"Takes forever for delivery, I called 1h 15 minutes after I placed my order and it still hadn't left the store. Do not order any roll w tempuas you will get close to no fish and a mouth full of Rice Krispies!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place, I have ordered sushi from here numerous times and it's always so good.Very fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Meilleur sushi en ville.

Je n'ai jamais mis les pieds la-bas, mais j'en commande parfois quand je dois rester au bureau pour le lunch. Absolument fantastique et ingénieux. Tu reçois ta barquette ( en plastique transparent ). Tes sushis sont adorablement présentés et un petit collant sur la boîte t'indique quel est lequel. Aussi, chacun vient avec une sauce différente, sur laquelle il est inscrit avec les mêmes petits collants, quel rouleau doit faire trempette ou. service client et facilité 10/10, aussi, c'est CUTE !

Ça, c'est sans parler de la qualité du poisson et de la tiédeur du riz. Un mix parfait de délicieuses combinaisons qui font frétiller mon palais et apaisent sans pareil ma rage de poisson cru. La livraison est ultra rapide , 15 minutes ou moins, ce qui me garantit d'avoir fini de dîner dans les temps. 

Osuka Sushi mérite VRAIMENT d'avoir plus d'attention. A vos baguettes !"}
{"text":"Sushi here is very reasonable price. The sushi is fresh and everything is prepared on the spot which is great for a sushi take out counter.  The staffs are very friendly and accommodates with special request. My family was very happy with the take out we got from there!"}
{"text":"À date, le meilleur sushi pour livraison que je connaisse à Mtl!
Tout est délicieux, impossible d'être déçu! Néanmoins, il vous faut absolument tester les Spécialités Du Chef!!! Elles sont toutes accompagnées de leur propre sauce, repérées par une petite étiquette collée sur le pot. 
Vraiment, à tester!!!"}
{"text":"À première vu, l'endroit est très simple et très petit, mais le sushi est très bon et bien garni, et le personnel très gentil, je le recommande . 
Merci"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here many times and it's always been tasty and fresh. There are sushi spots closer to my place but I'll make the detour to come here because they're always on point. It helps that they staff are so friendly! 

I ordered 250 pieces for my boyfriends birthday party recently and it was seriously. The. Bomb. I had a few leftovers for breakfast and then we ordered some more the next night for dinner. I'm now in sushi rehab."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good selection of rolls. I have only ordered delivery combos from here, and everytime have been pleasantly surprised. They deliver quite fast (within 30 minutes) and are always nice and courteous. The delivery plates are consistent and well presented, and the miso soup is quite excellent. Not a bad choice for sushi options!"}
