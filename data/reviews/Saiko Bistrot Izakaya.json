{"text":"Honteux ! Française en voyage à montreal j'ai voulu tester ce Resto japonais avec des amis : sushis médiocres sauces oubliées bières indisponibles donc on vous sert une autre bière similaire mais coûtant plus chère sans qu'on vous l'annonce 2 desserts servis au lieu d'un et refus de le reprendre... à la fin du repas agression de la \"responsable\" qui ne vous a même pas servi et vous réclame au minimum 20% de pourboire car \"c'est la pratique au Canada\"  Je déconseille aux touristes qui sont la manifestement pour remplir les caisses... Dommage de voir une telle attitude surtout pour un Resto ou la note avoisine les 150$ pour simplement quelques sushis...."}
{"text":"Now this is goood stufff it better then any I've had in a long time time.... Good for groups n itss 5starrrrrr"}
{"text":"Definitively one of the best places in Montreal to have fresh sashimi! The chefs and part of the clientele are Japanese. I first wanted to order the tasting menu, but for $80+ per person, the 4 course menu did not appeal to me. I opted à la carte instead and ordered the following:  -miso soup ($5!!): won't recommend -beef sashimi: very good, but sauce a bit too sweet -seafood ceviche: delicious, but taste too much lime/yuzu  -omakase sashimi: HEAVENLY gooooood!! Seven kind of fishes, 2 pieces each for $45. Not cheap at all, but definitively worth it!!  -seared salmon and unagi sushi: Unagi is a must! So tasty!!  -miso black cod: very good  Service, however, was really so-so. The waitress was not very knowledgable. I've asked for suggestions and she just gave me a description of a few dishes. She didn't even know which fishes were available on that night. That was very disappointing.  Quite expensive, but for a special occasion, I will definitively return to try out more sushi and sashimi! *nom*nom*"}
{"text":"The Brie with scallop combination test strange. A bit bitter so I have to use the sweet sauce to cover. Haven't tried the other so I may give it a shot again. Ceviche was okay. Hard to chew as usual."}
{"text":"Wow this was amazing. I had the nigiri plate and every - single - bite was incredible. Standouts included a beautifully gently seared scallop, amazing salmon roe, these supreme marinated mushrooms (which pared incredibly with the sweet egg omelet), and some wonderfully lightly marinated pieces of hamachi and (I think) mackeral. The 13 pieces came with avocado and rice and looked small but was plenty, even after a day spent walking a solid 10+ km around town this afternoon.  Honestly holy cow, what a meal. I can't wait to go back. I'll definitely go with a date and get the omakase dinner."}
{"text":"Waiting time over 30 mins. Starving to death, and the waitress and waiter disappeared. There aren't many customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of few restaurants in Montreal where they could offer \"real\" sushi. The chef here really cares about the freshness of ingredients and the quality. Even though it could be a bit pricey, it's normal considering the quality of the sushi here."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allé souper tard samedi le 6 août, et avons tous les trois commandé le menu dégustation omakase. À part une petite entrée où le goût de la sauce de sésame grillé était un peu trop prononcé, et autre avec la malencontreuse combinaison de pince de homard et de camembert (???), tout était absolument impeccablement frais, beau, délicieux, mémorable. Le service s'est avéré très attentionné, donnant les explications souhaitées avec précision douceur et clarté. Et je ne dois pas omettre de mentionner les desserts: sublimes et présentés avec amour, chose tout à fait inusitée dans un resto japonais. Sans les deux petits bémols mentionnés, ce serait un cinq étoiles. Constance"}
{"text":"Excellents sushis! Frais, varié et service impeccable!  Très fortement recommandé, vous ne serez pas déçu(e), c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi with very helpful waitress. The saiko maki roll was very tasty as were the vegetable tempura rolls."}
{"text":"It's literally Japan in Montreal!  I lived in Japan for quite a while and ever since I came back in Montreal, I couldn't find any sushi restaurant that was equivalent to the ones in Japan. And then I found Saiko. The fish was very fresh, the flavour was incredibly delicious and the food presentation was beautiful! I was getting teary.  Although we waited a little long, it was definitely worth it. Nice decor, nice staff. This restaurant needs more popularity. It's a great place to go if you are not afraid to try new meals.  Japanese culture is seriously getting popular in Montreal and I am so glad we are getting REAL authentic cuisine by REAL Japanese cooks. (No offence to cooks from other nationalities)  ???"}
{"text":"Outstanding - simply put the chef put together our menu for the evening and every item was made with passion and expertise I have not seen such mastery in a Montreal sushi restaurant ever! The fish is totally amazing. THE BEST !"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice ambience! Don't normally like grilled squid but it is delicious here and the fish is so fresh!"}
{"text":"We went here as part of our trip. I'm a sushi lover and this place is one of the best I've ever tried. Definitely recommend the nigiri especially the salmon ones. Fresh, lots of variety. Then finish off the meal with the chocolate mousse cake which is the perfect balance of richness and sweetness.   It's in a really convenient area steps outside the metro station downtown. Nice place and great service. You're getting excellent value for what you pay. I definitely would go here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great staff and the chef is fantastic! We try to go there as often as we can."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Vancouver and I lived in Japan so quality when it comes to Japanese food is a must and this place did not fall short. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"The worst sushi in Montreal. Food wasn't good. Service was what you'd expect at a McDonald's. Limited alcohol choices. Not worthy of a rating above 1 star. Dinner was $91 Canadian dollars and a COMPLETE RIP OFF. DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"I've there twice, both times sitting at the bar, and both time I was overwhelmed by the great fresh fish, great service, and considerate staff. Both time place was relatively busy, and service was great in spite of them being busy. One small negative thing was that more than half of the bottles on the sake menu was not available, and that happened on both times ("}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service! I went a small group and we sampled a wide variety of items. Everything was fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have ever tasted. Extremely fresh and beautifully presented. Try Nigiri sushi and other sashimi dishes as this place is the best for fresh fish. I have been to almost all popular sushi restaurants in montreal. I guarantee the freshness of any fish you taste here. If you are a real sushi lover who is looking for quality and authentic Japanese style sushi, this place is the one."}
{"text":"Good value VS price ratio. It's is very rare to find a sushi place where quantity is greater than quality, but where quality is that good. Friendly staff and easy location, try it out! We really liked the eggplant with scallops entree and the Carpacio!"}
{"text":"If I could leave ZERO stars I would. Currently waiting  nearly 1 hour for our food to be served and the place is not even crowded!!! very poor service. Nice ambience and music, not sure how the food is yet, I think they are catching it from the ocean at the moment. The cocktails are pretty much juice, not strong at all. Will not return and do not recommend.   Food came back, absolutely horrible. Not sure what all these other reviews are talking about. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Very good food, a little overpriced for small portions though, and the staff was not the most attentive nor the most helpful. 3 Stars just because food was good"}
{"text":"I've visited Saiko bistrot Izakaya for the 3rd time just a few days ago. I'll start by saying they have to be the best sushis I've ever had in Canada.   You enter the restaurant, greeted in Japanese, rooms have a great ambience, intimate candle lit tables. Long bar where you can watch the chef cook. Their house cocktails are delicious. Lychee martini is a must try!  I always order a few starters: carpacchio of the day,  gratin oysters an Kara age this time. Everything was phenomenal beside the karaage which just tasted like popcorn chicken...  Getting past that we received a few roll which I've mostly forgotten: we try the Kamikaze everywhere we go. I remember loving all of them and one of the beaver roll. Perfect amount of petrified fish on to top.  They had an everything matcha night and we shares a matcha cake roll filled with very light cream and sweet Rice puff.  I would recommend this place to others And you can expect my visit sometimes soon again!"}
{"text":"Was like described by others. Wasn't disappointed at all. Waiter was very nice. Good inventory of fish. Order the toro sushi, no picture i was to in the hurry to savored it. Fresh and melt in my mouth. Chirashi was well present dish see picture. Full of fresh fish kig salmon, scallop, tuna, hamachi and others kind of fish and nicely fresh cut avocados slice. Good service, nice decor. Will defitnetly go back and i really recommend this place for a nice sushi date in montreal."}
{"text":"If you like enjoying very fresh sushi, beautifully presented in a nice atmosphere, you will love Saiko Bistrot Izakaya. We went there for dinner on a Friday night and almost had the place to ourselves. Ordered a combination of appetizers (oysters gratin, pizza sushi, ceviche), sushi rolls (kamikaze, Vancouver, California, dragon eye) and sashimi/sushi (makerel and spicy crab). The interesting cocktails and extensive drink menu is a plus. We spent about $30/pp, but felt it was worth it, given their unique offerings. The flavors did not overwhelm the kids' palettes. And my husband loved everything he tasted, although he usually hates seafood. That right there, says it all."}
{"text":"For the last decade, I have been feeling that the quality of sushi has plateaued in Montréal.  However, I'm now happy to report that Saikô has managed to reach new heights in Montréal sushi scene.  If you are old enough to remember the early happy years of Soto in the mid 90's, which at the time broke the grounds and set the trend of nouveau sushi (and its subsequent decline), Chef Yusa of the original St-Laurent Soto has returned to bring back these glory days with even more wisdom and finesse sans pretense of the late Soto.  His unexpected combination of flavors, eel, avcado, shiitake maki, or yuzu mayonnaise on top of crab maki wrapped by an infinitely thin layer of filo, etc., is simply mesmerizing.  But it just doesn't end there; he also has the freshest fish to create easily some of the best nigiris in the Northeast.  From the melt-in-your-mouth sweet shrimp from Greenland to generous cuts of hirame (sole), the cuts of the fish could stand alone by themselves with very little or almost no seasoning (although the chef painstakingly creates little drips of sauce for almost every other piece).  Who would have thought that we could taste the Hidaka kombu and scallops from Hokkaido on the restaurant table in Montréal, seriously? If you are a sushi lover, you have to taste his sushi to believe it!"}
{"text":"Exquisite food in small portions.  Good for those days when you're recovering from a big lunch and you want something light but delicious.      If you are feeling splurgy for sushi, Saiko is probably your best (IMO your only) bet in Montreal.  Don't try to \"save money\" by going to other places that are cheaper in Montreal.  Unlike other big cities where cheaper sushi can still be great quality... NOT SO IN MONTREAL."}
{"text":"Excellent Nigiri! Like most of Japanese people here, i am not a big fan of huge colorful Maki rolls, so I was always wishing to have simple but tasty Nigiri sushi, then ta-da! I found this beautiful restaurant. Talented and passionate sushi chef, modern style decoration (not necessary Asian style you know), very clean, perfect size and texture of sushi rice. This is not a cheap place, so its better trying when you feel like eating gooood. Id like to try side menus next time."}
{"text":"One of the good Japanese spots in downtown Montreal. Very nice decor and sit down. Waiters are courteous. Sushi chefs as well.  The food is just incredible, starting from the Miso soup and salad, to the shrimp tempura.  The beef and salmon tataki are mouth-watering. The vegetable sides are cooked to perfection. You will not regret ordering those.  Sushi is fresh and very tasty especially the chief specialties. The maquerel and the salmon Nigiri were delightful. The lower priced rolls are however average.  Service was kind of slow but to be expected during lunch time.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I had the chef's tasting menu which was good and fufilling but for the price, I felt like it isn't worth it although I would like to try their a la carte menu next time! Service was good and love the sashimis"}
{"text":"Best meal I've eaten in Montreal! Fresh, creative, delicious - ordered seaweed salad and scallop appetizer, both were amazing. I'm coming back tomorrow, yep, that's how good it is!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi I have tried including in Japan. Very nice setting and good service. Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Service was slow... Didn't offer us drink menu.... Didn't give us water refill.... We ordered miso soup, grilled squid, yakitori, carpaccio, gentleman, my life and duo. The miso soup, according to my friend, she knew which brand of miso soup they were using... Aka bought from the store and it was five dollars each. Grilled squid and yakitori were okay, nothing special. Carpaccio and gentleman were good. The beef in my life was not tender. It was average standard. The rice in the sushi and the makis in the duo was awful.... Not sticky not flavored."}
{"text":"Sat at sushi bar and talked with friendly, Japanese chef.  He prepared imaginative variations of nigiri and rolls.  Also had seasonal shishamo.  Food is authentic and good quality.  Sapporo on tap was nice extra benefit.  Compared with NY, very reasonably priced.  This is my new go-to for sushi in Montreal."}
{"text":"Another great find for mtl a table resto week. For 41$ I chose to have scallops stuffed with crab filling, a chef's choice sushi platter (including  a variety of sashimi!) and green tea roll cake (not the best after a strong meal).   Presentation was impeccable, location is prime with plenty of parking around the area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I just had a lovely meal at Saiko.  We ordered the chirashi and a special Maki roll which were both impeccable in terms of quality and presentation.  The eggplant appetizer stuffed with seafood and paired with a sweet miso sauce was my highlight of the night.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good service and comfortable inside on a cold day. Ceviche was a big portion with all kinds of seafood. It also came with 5 maki rolls, which were interesting and unique with different skin wrap. The Matcha cake was also good. Salmon roll with crispy outside was okay."}
{"text":"My number one take out place! Service is fast and also their delivery is fast too! I usually order maki set menu. I'm very picky seafood eater but this place offers very fresh fish to their customers. The take out packaging is clean! Big plus to me. The portions are right on for the price they offer. What I really love is... they stay original with the maki. When I moved to MTL I noticed a lot of sushi restaurants offer fancy maki but it's just...\"wrong\" or over the limit. Some say it's nice but to me it's just being too much. This place offers tempura style maki and much more without being \"too much.\" It's right on the downtown so great location and great for lunch if you work on downtown."}
{"text":"Definitely were treated like second-class citizens because we had children with us. When we asked for the chef to make a larger Sashimi dish because they only had options with very few pieces we were told bluntly they can't do that and we have to order multiple of the same thing. With blank stares on our faces we obliged and carried on with our meal. The food was pretty tasty but can't say we would come back simply due to the fact that they didn't get it . And by it I mean the reason they have a job is because there are customers and so they should be a little bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Incredible food, the sashimi so so fresh and delicious. Reasonable price for the quality. Will definitely be going here again. I will just be dreaming about last nights dinner until then."}
{"text":"Wonderful seafood appetizer!!!! A bit sour, sort of like Thai style cuisine but exquisitely designed--I would say that this dish deserves some Michelin stars! The sushi duo is also quite delicate."}
{"text":"HOLY H*LL, am I allowed to type this word? Okay, anyways...my ultimate favorite Japanese joint of all time. I only ate once and yes, I love it so much...food was GODLY. Just GODLY. I had the chirashi and matcha cheesecake, both made me cry from happiness. Fresh fish, beautiful presentation, good texture of cake (soft and creamy and not too green tea-y or bitter or too sweet) and absolutely phenomenal service and nice ambiance. I enjoyed my experience there and will be coming back for sure for sure!  I really recommend the two dishes I mentioned before. Chirashi, if you didn't already know, is sashimi on a bed of sushi rice. It came with a ring of beautifully sliced avocado and a shiso leaf on top. Great variety of sashimi from hotate, sake, squid, etc. Just beautiful...  It is definitely more on the expensive side, but seriously...if I had a lot of money to spend, I'd come here every other day and be a regular. But nope, most of us do not have that luxury. Highly recommend this place. This surpasses my other favorite Japanese restaurants. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I personally would say I don't like sushi but my friends forced me to go here and I could say it was delicious. If you are new to sushi try the dragon eye and yakitori. The place is really clean and tasteful for a date. But not out of place for a causal dress with friends."}
{"text":"Great, fresh, delicious sushi. Lovely decor and ambience. The tapas menu looks fantastic - must try it next time."}
{"text":"High end Japanese restaurant with the freshest fish I've had. Omakase, chef's choice, is the best option... The lobster and ceviche aps were to die for. Tuna belly nigiri had my feet dancing under the table, and I finally understand why people swoon over unagi. The sauces were lovely in presentation without being overly sweetened  like the fast food sushi you find elsewhere. Every course was delightful and spaced out beautifully yet it took, despite having a reservation, a while to place a drink order while we perused the unique menu. 4.5 stars. I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"Sushi just isn't the same in Montreal.  Since there isn't a Japanese clientele except for the occasional tourist,  it's completely catered to the locals. However they do have some great things on the menu like chicken cutlet, eggplant and tempura on their appetizer list. My favorite meal  is to have a martini and order their dinner salad, chicken cutlet, veggie tempura, miso soup and rice.  It's like eating  a meal at someone's home in Japan, but it's Montreal."}
{"text":"Very good sashimi and sushi. Fish is fresh, very fresh. Good quality and price is fair."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best sushi place in Montreal !!   AMAZING :) Try it out."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant a couple times before but never went in.  Not sure what made me decided to go in.  Perhaps it was such a nice day and I felt like splurging on a good meal.  Glad I went.  The place gives off a pretty nice vibe- clean, comfortable and relaxing.  My friend and I both think the food was excellent.  Well worth the money.  It's hard to find quality sushi restaurants in Montreal.  This is definitely one of them.  Only con about this place is that the service can be somewhat slow during lunch time.  Better to come after lunch rush.  Haven't tried dinner there yet.  Looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"Excellent service et sushi parfaits, on a adoré notre expérience et on va recommander!"}
{"text":"We went there a couple of weeks ago and tried Chef's Omakase tasting menu, the Miso Black Cod and the Chirashi bowl.   I'm not a maki person so I had mostly Sushi and Sashimis. The fishes were super fresh! Our waiter, aka owner took the time to explain their menu and where the fishes came from. I would recommend ordering individual pieces rather than the Omakase menu because the quantity was on the small side for the price paid.  We finished our dinner with a delicious green tea cake on the house! Great service! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"10 minutes ago we were seated (party of 2) by an unfriendly staff and never served...got up and left."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for Valentines day dinner. We checked the special menu for that night on their website and knew what to order. But when we saw the menu, it was different and more expensive than we found on the internet. I suppose it was a year before menu probably? Anyway, new menu had more dishes and sounded good. So we decided go with it, and it was a right decision!  Fish carpaccio, lobster with brie cheese, eel&avocado sushi roll, fish tartar, hosomaki with broth(the consept used from Japanese \"ochadtuke\", nigiri omakase and dessert, from the start to finish, it was amazing.   I'm from where sushi is the best place to eat in Japan. I have eaten lots of great sushi including in Canada and this was by far the best I've ever had in Canada. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The portion of fish on nigiri was generous, they used a whole scallop on 1 nigiri! That is quite unusual in Canada.  After dinner, I happened to speak to the chef, he asked me where I was from in Japan and we found out we were from the same prefecture. I told him that the best sushi my husband and I had was in his hometown.  It was the second time to visit this place after I was recommended by my doctor. This is my new favorite restaurant! Next time, I'll try omakase for sure!"}
{"text":"Omakase all the way! Came from NYC to MTL and discovered this gem.  The restaurant doesn't look like much, however, the proof is in the pudding."}
{"text":"It's my second time having dinner here, last night was my best friend's birthday dinner, she really likes the Japanese food, so she made the reservation two weeks ago. While eating our dinner, I checked in on Facebook said happy birthday to her. I have no idea how the staff found out that it was her birthday but they gave her a cake surprisingly. The food was excellent but I find the price was too expensive tho"}
{"text":"This little gem is just off Rue de la Gauchatierre in downtown Montreal. It's the only restaurant in that strip that's open at night, and was recommended by a client. The entire staff is Japanese, and you might wonder why that matters, but only until you've been to a different sushi joint where the guy behind the sushi bar was a tall redheaded farmboy and the sushi was just what you'd expect from that kind of a guy (ran into this in Kentucky, not a hotbed of sushi).  The manager himself made me up some sangria (not a normal staple in a sushi joint), and it was fantastic. Yeah, it's hard to screw up, but this was good. Their miso soup was good. Hard to screw that up too. I ordered the Duo, which is a mixed bag of maki and nigiri put together by the chef. When it was brought out, the manager explained to me what all I was eating. He pointed out the one kind of sauce you use for the maki, and the other for the sushi. There was one item he said to eat without any sauce. Wish I'd saved that for last, since it was incredible.   Price was pretty good, $28 for the Duo, service was good, although it wasn't crowded. Highly recommend. Quick walk from the Marriott Chateau Champlain, which is a great hotel as well."}
{"text":"On the last day of my Montreal trip with my girlfriend, I wanted to end off with a bang. We had time to kill and to my surprise there was a well rated Japanese cuisine, so we decided to check it out.   I went in expecting the place to be busy as it was a Thursday night. But upon arrival, the only people there were me and my girlfriend. Ignoring the fact that the place was practically dead, we ordered.  We ordered three different nigiri's and upon taking the first bite, the rice tasted under cooked. The chicken skewers were average and so was the gyoza. The \"my life\" beef had a lot of vain's making it hard to chew and eat. We didn't order anything else, but from the things we ordered, the food is definitely not worth it's price.  The server that was serving us gave us looks when we asked about the things on the menu and overall seem quite busy Chinns Ginger did you fall  At the end of everything, she put on a 15% tip without consulting us and gave us the bill.   Overall I would not recommend going to this restaurant as there are plenty of other better Japanese cuisines around Montreal as they all have better tasting food with more reasonable price."}
{"text":"I rate this place 3.5-4, keeping in mind it was meant to be a quick lunch so we did not partake in the way I usually would at an Izakaya.  Most of our table had delicious bento boxes but one had an absolutely beautiful looking chirashi plate. The pictures of the chirashi shown here just do not look as awesome as it did.  Service was attentive and the restaurant was clean. I'm likely to return on a subsequent visit to Montreal and order lots of smaller dishes."}
{"text":"Had the chef's tasting menu at $88 for 4 services.   Although the food was pretty good, definitely not worth $88. I easily can get better at more affordable pricing elsewhere."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best sushi I have ever had. The sushi chef was entrtaining. I ordered the chefs special and threw myself on his mercy. For 120 CAD it was a bit expensive, but this guy takes great pride and care in his work. I highly recommend. Try the urchin and the tuna caviar with Quail egg. Yum!"}
{"text":"From now on this will be my favorite Place for sushi in Montreal . The stuff is very professional, the taste of sushi is unbelievable ! Duo plate had combination of sushi and rolls variety. I highly recommend this plate for all sushi fans. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Yum. Enjoyed the omakase and was pleasantly surprised at the choices of the chef. PERFECT amount of food, exquisite favors, great service.  Can eat seafood ceviche all day, errday."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in town.  I am having diner there at least twice a month with my family"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places in Montreal. We ordered a combo for delivery. We were very happy with the quantity and the quality."}
{"text":"Very outgoing, friendly chef that creates art. Delicious fish, so fresh, this was a wonderful experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Sushis here were soooooo gooooooood!!! Fish was very fresh! Inside the restaurant, it was very clean. Also I like the tableware in Japanese style. The service is normal. The price is a little bit expensive but I think it's worth it because of the taste and the freshness of food.  In one word, I strongly recommend this place if you want to treat yourself one time for a while with delicious sushis."}
{"text":"We went because of the flood of great Yelp reviews. I called ahead and was told that we did not need reservations, so we walked on over. We went in and there was only one other couple in the whole place at 7 pm on a Thursday. They told us to sit anywhere. We sat down and a guy brought us water and we started asking questions. He did not speak much English we learned and he was not our waiter, so he indicated we had to wait for him. Okay, no problem as we continued to look over the menu. We started collecting our questions and wondering about a drink order.  AT LEAST 10 minutes goes by and no one even acknowledges our existence. They were in hiding or something.  After all this, the lack of other customers and the weird isolationist vibe, we decided to leave. This place may have great food, but we will never know and will never come back. Yelp let us down this time."}
{"text":"Slowly but surely, the state of Japanese restaurants is getting better and better in Montreal. Saiko is without a doubt amongst my Top 3 sushi restaurants in Montreal. The nigiris are absolutely amazing and the quality of the fish is irreproachable. Some of the fish is imported from Japan.   Your best bet would be to do an omakase dinner and let Chefs Yusa-san and Shin Ichi-san know your preferences. Do not be shy and ask which fish is freshest on the day that you are there. Do not skip on the dessert, especially if you love green tea.    My wife and I have been here a few times and are surely about to become regulars. We always had good service, even when we were in a large group.  Before I came here, I didn't know much about this restaurant. Indeed, Saiko does not receive nearly as much buzz as some other sushi restaurants in the city. I first came with no expectations. It is now one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the nicer sushi places in Montreal. The saiko maki roll with scallops was great!!"}
