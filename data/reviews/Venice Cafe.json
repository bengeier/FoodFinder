{"text":"Had early dinner tonite, had shrimp and sausage with greens, UNBELIEVABLE!  Topped off with Key Lime Pie, if you have not been there what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Like what they have done to the place and what they kept. The painting on the wall has been there for longer than I know and gives the Venice the character it has."}
{"text":"An institution...in the best sense of that term.    You don't know Kent until you grab a draft at the Venice.  It's the spot to start and/or stop your brilliant night out at Kent.  Josh Cribbs rules."}
{"text":"will miss the venice and all of its old world charm...will miss the fam and all the stories....hope it doesn't change too much"}
{"text":"Cheapest drinks in Kent and free bar snacks. You can't go wrong here.  This is the oldest bar in Kent by a mile. It is also a townie bar, although more and more college students are starting to discover how awesome the Venice can be.  Make sure to get the Flaming Dr. Pepper shot. It has enough alcohol in it to kill an elephant, but it is soooooooo good.  Did I mention this was the cheapest bar in Kent?  I'm glad this place exists."}
{"text":"Takes me back to my days at Kent where we could get a bottle of Moleson Golden for 75 cents..."}
{"text":"Drinks poured short.  Bartender adds ice.  So kind of you...  boo.  No food on a Saturday at 10 pm.  Boo. No reason to return."}
{"text":"The roast beef Mac-and-cheese sandwich was to die for. Honestly this place is a cozy little cafe with a bar, tables, and booth. The service was easy and pretty quick. I'm just amazed at the sandwich, it was great. We also order hush puppies and fries which were also good. 10/10 would recommend if you are looking for a casual place to hang with some friends, eat a delicious sandwich and be entertained."}
{"text":"The Venice is my favorite bar in Kent! If you're a craft beer lover, their selection is by far one of the best!!"}
{"text":"A sweet bar it is...especially since all bars are non-smoking now. I love playing pool there...but to list it under pizza does a disservice to ANY pizza place. Fill your gut elsewhere before you enjoy some time at the Venice!"}
{"text":"This place is quite cute! Went during happy hour so my friend and I were able to take advantage of their $5 16oz mason jar mixed drinks. Go with the Lynchburg! Didn't check out the food or PINBALL MACHINES, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"New ownership has done a good job with the Venice. They kept a lot of the \"dive\" charm that made the Venice unique, but cleaned a lot of things up. It's really nice that the place no longer smells like Urine. It's a cool place to listen to a band with their new raised stage, but it can get pretty crowded and loud if you aren't there specifically to listen to music.   The drink specials are usually what draw me here. Until 9pm it's ungodly cheap. They have a whole drink menu of specials. Probably 10 different options. And the happy hour is even good on weekend nights, which is a plus.   Adding Erie Street Cafe into the bar was huge too. That place has the best food in Kent, IMO."}
{"text":"If it's Thursday after 7:30 PM, there's a good chance you'll find me at the Venice. They have an awesome happy hour special until 9 PM, $10 sixty ounce pitchers of margaritas. That equals about 4 glasses of margaritas. I've tried a few different flavors, but the salted watermelon is easily my favorite. The other alcohol is reasonably priced and there is a $10 minimum for credit/debit cards like most bars.   Unfortunately, the Venice is a bit out-dated in the hustle and bustle that is becoming Kent. Perhaps the owners intend for it to be that way as it offers a reprieve for townies from the bars that are dominated by students. However, with the recent introduction of Erie Street Kitchen to the bar, this place needs to make some changes. More comfortable seating and some updated decor would go a long way to bringing more people into the Venice and more customers to Erie Street Kitchen."}
{"text":"The best bar in Kent. The first bar I have been to that sells 40's. It is a family owned bar. The walls are painted with old brownish paintings of Venice, Italy. There is a jukebox and a few pool tables. Some of the booths have interesting carvings and stating that they love whoever for ever. It was always a pretty mellow and low key spot when I was in school. I went down a few months ago and it seems like business has picked up. There will always be a place in my heart for this bar."}
