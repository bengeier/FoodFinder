{"text":"This place gets all five stars for a good reason.
We were looking for a place to eat around PHX SkyHarbor while we waited for our luggage to arrive on a later flight. We Googled Chinese places and Wong's Chinese Dining was one of the closest to the airport. My mom and I showed up and the joint was FULL! We grabbed a booth and ordered in three minutes; we were that hungry! Our food came quickly and we just about inhaled our potsticker appetizer. It was so flavorful and yummy. My mom ordered the Twice Cooked Pork and I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken. Both were delicious! We also shared a pot of hot tea that reminded us of the tasty authentic tea we drank in Beijing. Altogether we paid no more than $27.  The service was also AWESOME. The mighty Wong himself greeted every table and was courteous and attentive. Our orders came quickly and the place was clean. All of the staff were very kind and friendly, as well as professional. Parking was great and convenient. Would we go back? YES! Would we recommend to friend, family, and strangers? HECK YES."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment and I must say it was very good.

I had the beef and vegetable lunch special
Came with delicious egg drop soup
Service was first rate - checked back often
Food was hot and came quick
Quality of food was 5 stars

I will be coming back here because the food was great and hit the spot. Do not be fooled by the older building, come inside and fill up on tasty Chinese food. Thanks"}
{"text":"Was apprehensive after looking at the pictures of the building and address. More than pleasantly surprised! Best Chinese I've experienced anywhere."}
{"text":"Your time is important and they know it. Fast service when you need it for take out. Excellent food that doesn't taste as it's been soaked in salt to cover up any shortcomings. There are no prideful displays inside to remind you where you are. With the brightest sign being the hanging beer neon in the corner. The focus here is to offer the right amount of food for a single patron to a family sharing a quiet dinner. Your gonna take some home. And if you don't, order something else and enjoy tomorrow. These family run eating joints are becoming far and few between. Offering you a place to recall and create memories through our favorite pastime. So when you tell that person, \"Let's go and get something to eat\". Remember this place."}
{"text":"Funny looking building,awesome tasting food. Great food, cheap prices, and lots and lots of food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix I'm from San  Francisco and I know real Chinese food ans this is it!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite spot, best Chinese food and really nice service. I always get the Mongolian beef during lunch time it's delicious,they need to go light on the onions."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and the portions are huge! The only downside to this place is the building. The outside looks rundown and the inside is very outdated and dingy."}
{"text":"East of the Mississippi, I can count the number of good American Chinese food joints I've eaten at on a single hand. For some reason they don't make \"Chinese\" food out here like they do back east. This place, while unassuming from the outside, is among those few places that fit on my hand. Their lo mein wasn't sickeningly greasy, the sesame chicken had just the right amount of crispiness, and the vegetables were fresh.The only reason I've withheld a star is because they ran out of fried chicken wings - this is the very first time I've been to a Chinese restaurant that ran out of them!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Chinese in AZ. I've tried most of em. I intentionally vomited my meal after leaving, it was that sketchy. They graciously tried to offer me free food. No thanks. All the positive reviews on here are absolutely insane, Taco Bell is better for you than this place."}
{"text":"My wife & I were very excited to try Wong's based on reviews here and when we arrived at the restaurant. It has the kind of \"dive\" vibe we get very excited about. I can't see what the hubbub is about. The food was pretty terrible overall. I am willing to consider that we ordered wrong, but we got Kung Pao Chicken, Dry-Fried Shredded Beef, Wong's Special Chicken, and Pot Stickers.

Going item-by-item, the pot stickers were frozen and can be purchased at any Asian grocery store, so, essentially, they were something I can and do make at home. The beef was not shredded but sliced (which makes dry-fried dishes very hard to eat) and tasted like old fry oil and ketchup, disgusting. The special chicken was initially pretty excellent. It is fried chicken in a sweet-and-sour sauce, very similar in style and presentation to Springfield, MO-style cashew chicken. As we ate more of the dish, however, it became apparent that this chicken was breaded in Chinese donut batter and also tasted of old fry oil. Disappointing.

I saved my discussion of kung pao chicken for last. This is one of my favorite Chinese dishes in the world, and we ordered it because one of the regulars waiting for take-out recommended it. This is, without a doubt, one of the saddest dishes I have ever eaten. It had no flavor: no salt, no soy sauce, no ginger, no Szechuan peppercorn, nothing. It tasted of celery, if anything at all. Additionally, the dish was swimming in a watery, brown-grey sauce that was the result of the zucchini in the dish. I'm okay with overly sauced Chinese food, but without any flavor and not thickened with cornstarch, this was just a mess. Additionally, the chicken tasted like it had been par-boiled before being stir-fried, so it was tough, flavorless, and an unappetizing grey color. Completely disgusting.

As I said at the beginning, I am willing to wager that we should have ordered the fried rice, which people seem to recommend, but I don't believe we will be trying Wong's again, as this food just isn't up to snuff."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to PHX. Damn good pot stickers and tangerine chicken. There was a 15 mine wait for the fresh made pot stickers."}
{"text":"I have to tell you the place inside is a little dark, and really needs paint. But the food is so good the atmosphere fades. We ordered the sizzling rice soup and I could take this intravenously its that good. I will definitely be back, they have take out or dine in. Make sure you try this place."}
{"text":"Good food not the nicest atmosphere but if you're looking for good Chinese food at lunch this is a good choice. Know what you want and don't ask anything about making a change to how a dish is served and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Wong's is super delicious and everything they make is. So if you don't know what to get and just pick something it sure to be great! I love their combo meals and the food is always fresh and steamy hot. It's to die for. 
The people are nice and the building looks torn up but it is safe and clean. If you have to go to the bathroom, you have walk. through the outskirts of the kitchen, sort of.
Either way the food and everything is excellent. If your not picky."}
{"text":"I have never eaten in Wong's, only to go orders.  It is a Phoenix institution in a sea of Mexican restaurants.  When working in Phoenix, I on occasion have ordered take out for my staff on their advice.  It is really okay Chinese food.  If I was craving Chinese food, this wouldn't be it, but there is no Chinese food I have had in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area that would make me want to go back; including Flo's, Jade Palace, and Joyful Chinese.  They are all a 3 star, okay but not great."}
{"text":"Service and food is great, there every Monday. The AC is working very well, I recommend this place for lunch.. keep up the great service.."}
{"text":"Wong's is a great place for good Chinese food. Only one time was I disappointed. Our egg drop soup was not salted at all this past Thursday. We have been eating here for the last 10 years easy. Staff is friendly and portions are huge.  They only have a cooler so you may want
to wait until monsoon season is over if the heat gets to you."}
{"text":"Now that is some sad Chinese food. Cheap yes, but not good. I was hoping to find that \" hole in the wall\" place that nobody would try without knowing. But it is a rundown crappy place with not so good food."}
{"text":"Did you ever wish there was some undiscovered place left in Phoenix that has absolutely amazing food?  This is it!!!  I'd pay double for the humble ambiance and the sweet Chinese lady who served us.  The food was fresh, fresh, fresh.  Yum!  I am loathe to tell you about his because once this 35 year old gem is discovered, I won't be able to get a table."}
{"text":"Don't go by the looks of the place,cause the food & its flavor makes up for itAlways fresh & good!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight and got an order of curry shrimp to go. The place looks like a dive but the food is really awesome. The sauce was really delicious and there was plenty of food for me to have all I could eat and share a bit with a friend. I will definitely be going back to try some more items!"}
{"text":"Just love the food.. Good prices and portions, family has been coming here for over 20 years."}
{"text":"Yelp really f###Ked me on this one.  Seriously.  The place is beyond a dump.  I parked on a side street behind the place.  They seemed to use every cost cutting measure to keep this place going.  I am talking sheet shingles on the roof without even trimming it.  Run down Evap cooler rotted out all around the sides of the building around it.   Mops just tossed in the yard. Honestly I can't even describe how poor the condition of the building is.  You have see it for yourself.

Now on to the food.  Come on give me a frickin break.   Fried rice is just fried with some soy sauce.  Seriously no vegetables?   No Egg?  No Carrot.  Nothing but straight rice fried.

I got the house chicken Carlos Sr got Orange Chicken.   Half mine was super fried and half raw batter.  It was the weirdest thing ever.  Sauce had a very funky flavor I couldn't put my finger on.  Like fermented garlic.  And the Chicken seemed ReFried.

Carlos Sr.  one word on the Sauce.  Cloyingly sweet.  Gobs of gooey sugar sauce with minimal orange flavor.  First bite not bad.  But by the end.  My god you just want it to end.  His rice.  Same as mine.

In conclusion they make their food like they take care of their building.  Trying to cut every cost imaginable. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.   

Both lunch meals  14 bucks.     What is was worth.  About 5 or 6 bucks.   What it cost them to make.  LMFAO  about $1.50  if that.   No joke.

On a good note.  The reason I didn't just slam them with one star.  They were really nice.

Overall  AVOID."}
{"text":"Look like an interesting enough place drove all the way down here to check it out got a love these hole in the wall Chinese food places down here in Phoenix problem was drove all the way down here and the hours are wrong and it is close so highly disappointed"}
{"text":"The orange chicken is great!!! So are the egg rolls. I don't really like fried rice but the orange chicken combined works well with it. I haven't found a place with good sesame chicken at all, but this place makes me forget all about East coast sesame chicken! The inside looks like you're in some local Chinese province (if you can relate), but the takeout option is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Like everyone else says, don't let the interior, exterior, and physical location scare you away. This is very Mom and Pop Chinese food, at it's finest.  Excellent flavors on every dish they serve!  Fair pricing and generous servings make this place an all around winner!  The family is extremely nice and friendly.  Again focus on the outstanding food versus the old school 1950s digs!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 15 years.food never changes.My favorite Chinese food in Phoenix for lunch or dinner any day!This place is Family."}
{"text":"Hands down the best orange chicken I have ever put in my mouth!! Just tried the egg drop soup and its great! I love this hole in the wall place. Will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Lunch or dinner, Wongs always delivers. Love this place! Has always been great and fast. It's kind of a dive place, but I do love my dive places."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food place in the valley, the service was great the food was amazing.  The only thing I didn't like was the location but they have been here 30+ years."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place I've been to coming since I was a little girl, the outside looks kind of iffy, but the food is to die for really good."}
{"text":"All the flavored I could ask for in one little in the hole spot!! I loved it here and I will be coming back!!! Don't judge this place by the way it may look outside!! Judge it by the great flavors in all of there dishes!!! A must try place if your thinking about it!!!"}
{"text":"6/29/2017
Good Chinese flavors and large orders of food. Prices are very reasonable. Service is fast and friendly. 
Only thing that could improve is the restaurant appearance and no ac it's felt humid inside these AZ temp don't help.
dining for 2 was around $20"}
{"text":"Yeah this place is definitely a dive but as long as you can get past that, the food here is not bad actually. I thought the service here was decent as they get your food out rather quickly here.

I tried the orange chicken which some of you on Yelp recommended along with the pork fried rice and egg roll combo. While the portions are absolutely massive and you get your money's worth the food was just okay. The orange chicken really wasn't as good as I had hoped and the rice was nothing special.

With all that said I probably won't be back unfortunately, either that or maybe I should have ordered something else."}
{"text":"Where did this place come from? It went from being a little red building that I would pass on the side of the road from time to time over to Wong's, the almighty Chinese food joint. I knew it was a restaurant but I probably wouldn't have stopped unless it were for my co-workers who were going one day and asked if I wanted to go. I am so thankful I said \"Yes!\".

It is a dive. You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the head and you could probably convert the entire place to a motorcycle shop in less than an hour. Extra beverages are stacked against the wall, the tables are small, and the air conditioning is probably in need of a service call. All part of the ambiance! The menu isn't a surprise. When I visit a new Chinese place my first meal is always sweet and sour pork. This way I can get a bead on the same meals and see how they handle the basics. Like most other Chinese restaurant lunch entrees, Wong's lunch comes with an egg roll and rice. In this case it was sticky white rice. Crunchy, drippy sumptuous sweet and suckling sour chicken. It ranks up there with some of the best for certain. The rice was a wonderful mix of sticky and fluffy. I like to eat with chopsticks when possible and this rice was definitely edible with the primitive yet effective utensils. Back and for between the awesome chicken and rice to finally the egg roll. Crispy almost flaky wrapper with an almost too finely minced filling of pork, cabbage, and carrots. The three simply complimented one another throughout the entire lunch. So, so good.  

Wong's is EXACTLY why you don't go to a chain and why you don't continue to drive past that place you have seen a million times but never was curious enough to actually stop and dine. The prices are super reasonable to boot. Have I been burned by places like this? Yes, but the few duds are heavily outweighed by other good places and certainly by great places like this. Stop the next time you are driving by if this place looks sketchy, scary, or outright out of place. Because it is but inside they are serving delicious food."}
{"text":"This is a dive restaurant, but the food is really good and they serve you really large portions. Pricing is great and the service is good. It's worth a try, if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place ... For my experience an I know really good Chinese food from Mexicali ... This place is good !!!"}
{"text":"Never again. Forgot my lunch at home so a couple coworkers and I ordered from Wongs. I ordered orange chicken with a side of white rice. 

First I'll say the service was great, the people that work there are really nice. 

Second, alot of people avoid this place because it looks completely ran down BUT in my past experiences some hole in the walls have been the best.

Now about the food. I'll start with the rice, I LOVE rice, I grew up on it, so I know when rice is cooked properly. The rice at wongs was horrible, it actually tasted like they cooked it in too much water and just drained out the remaining water. I usially finish my plain rice if nothing else but I took 3 bites and threw it out. 
The orange chicken actually tasted like real oranges with a very natural flavor, which I loved BUT non of the breading on my chicken was on my chicken! As I picked up each piece the breading would just slide off. The actual chicken left behind was tough and dry and the breading turned soggy in the thick orange sauce they filled half way up the box. NOT WORTH $9. 
To add insult to injury my stomach wasn't right for two days after I ate here! I'll give it one star for service, but when the food actually makes you sick, one star is all you get."}
{"text":"Ehh this place is OK. The food I got was sub par and was kinda cold. felt like they gave me reheated food. Inside is not that clean and is jam packed. OK if there is no other food around"}
{"text":"I love Wong's!  I think it's the best orange chicken in the valley. They use only white meat chicken. I hear their egg rolls and fried rice are the best, too!

Wong's is a hole in the wall. There's no getting around it. It's not the prettiest, and if you've ever had to use their restroom you know that they could seriously do some remodeling, but it's clean (just old, and falling apart). The atmosphere is the only thing keeping it from being a 5-star place. The food is top notch!"}
{"text":"Had decent reviews so I thought it couldn't hurt. I've never really had BAD Chinese food before honestly... but the orange chicken had ZERO flavor. Like the \"orange sauce was absolutely tasteless which left me a little disappointed.. pupu platter wasn't any better which is a shame because the ladies that work there were so kind, which is why I'm adding a star for service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  Well rated.  Packed with people.  Friendly and outstanding service.  Great prices.

The lunch menu comes with egg drop soup, fried wonton wrappers, a pork eggroll, egg fried rice and whatever protein entree you pick.

I had the Mongolian beef.  It was just so salty and the meat had a weird texture.  My son had some shrimp dish and was happy.  My daughter had the teriyaki chicken and was disgusted.  She actually barely picked at it.  Some of the meat is so dark and some is so light.  There were pieces of fat and tendon, etc.  

The bathroom is very hard to get to.  Go through the crowded dining room, past the soda cases, through the kitchen.  Turn left at the stairs, go down the hallway and find it on the right.  

Very much a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Phoenix, hands down delicious. It's priced great and the food never disappoints. This is definitely a hidden gem in Phoenix worth checking out"}
{"text":"Service nice and food not good. Sweet and sour pork like jaw breakers, App platter's chicken wings so sticky had to dip napkin in the ice tea to wash fingers. Little flavor. We wore the smell of the place like when one visits the casino. Don't like smelling as Chinese food so got home and took shower ASAP. and changed clothes."}
{"text":"Two of us went there about three weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon. I went because of the reviews looked pretty good. Stay away from this place. It was terrible, ordered the sizzling rice soup, lousy. Then had the po-po platter and it came out just cremated.Got an order of chicken fried rice and it was garbage. There is no way in hell I would ever go back. Also forgot to mention the waitress catching the flys with her hands and not going to the restroom to wash her hands.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"This was by far the WORST chinese food I have ever tried. I'd rather eat sand paper with teriyaki sauce on it. The waitress was a complete jerk as well. I would NEVER recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for literally my whole life and the food has been outstanding, till a couple of months ago. I don't know what's changed, maybe new cooks? I don't know but nothing tastes the same. I did notice new employees, maybe that's the cause? Whatever it is, it's not making me want to come back. I want the old cooks back!!"}
{"text":"We were heading to a DBacks gameThis was the best hole in the wall I've ever been to. It's not in the best part of town, but it stands erect and proud so it's easily recognized. The back of the building, which is attached living quarters, suggests the structure could crumble under its own weight. The inside is dusty and lining one of the walls you'll find cases and cases of soda. There are outlets and fans that could use some attention as well as the decor. 

However dodgy this place looks, it makes up for it in attitude and flavor! The waitress was sweet and always smiling. I ordered Wong's Vegetarian Delight, Vegetarian Bean Curd Soup and Vegetarian Lo Mein. Each dish was cooked to perfection and flavor danced on my taste buds."}
{"text":"Yup, all the reviews are correct.  Just get past the location and looks and you'll find some authentic Chinese food.  Pork fried rice is great, as is almost everything else I tried for the first time today.  I WILL be back!!

Amendment;  food was good...but I did not feel very good afterwards.  Still will give them another chance..."}
{"text":"The best egg foo young in Phoenix.  Egg patties loaded with meat and veggies... the way it should be and not dumped on top.  The efy is covered in a great simple brown gravy."}
{"text":"What a delight. We were early to the Phoenix airport and decided to find some place nearby for dinner. We stumbled upon Wong's. Yes, the interior is run down, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly, the portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable ($7.95 for a typical dinner entree).  And the food was really good - all four dishes that our party of four ordered were really good. I'd go back again, but I live in California!  If I am ever in Phoenix again, I swear I'll make another trip to Wong's."}
{"text":"OMG!!  Great fast service, the food was fresh and so good.  Lots of food, a little dark for my liking at 7:00 p.m. dinner but the good food and service made it a great experience.  I would recommend this place for sure.

Our waiter was on fire with his great service.."}
{"text":"For a very inexpensive Chinese restaurant this place really is good.  The delightful family who serves everyone goes out of their way to make their customers happy and well fed.  The food is excellently fresh and very tasty.  Also while the atmosphere is divey, it's adorable."}
{"text":"i have ordered To-Go... alot! and ate in... i love it!! 
its a little red house.. you cant miss it... I'm pretty sure its family run... and its a cozy little place... the sweet and sour chicken/pork is great!! 

i always go for their lunch specials.. its no more than about $7 total... 
and you get a lot of food!! you get their soup ... then the entree! 
i always get their sweet and sour chicken or pork... a nice sized helping of egg fried rice.. chicken and bell peppers, big chunks of pineapple, onions in just the right amount of S&S sauce... a spring roll... its sooo good... and these little fried won tons.. so yummy... 

if you get take out.. you get all of it but the soup.. but that's alright :) when you get take out you always get more food stacked in the box :) yum! 

this is a great lunch spot down town :) its a hidden treasure..."}
{"text":"Really delicious Chinese food!
We had the Wong's spicy noodle soup, Kung Pao chicken and chicken chow main.... Mmmmm is YUMMY! 
Service is nice, prices are fair. 
Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food so tasty I bought the Sa Cha spicy chicken awesome will be returning for sure The wait staff are so helpful and courteous"}
{"text":"Wongs is the BOMB!!!! Chop Suey is yummy yummy to my tummy!!!! Nuff said =p"}
{"text":"You can't go \"Wong\" with this restaurant! After flying to Phoenix from Minneapolis we got off the plane very hungry. We googled the nearest Asian restaurant and found Wong's. Don't let the exterior of the building tour tour you from going in. They have the absolute best food and wonderful service. Just know, you will be taking a box of food home with you, regardless of how hungry you are. The portion are super sized, but the prices are small. We paid $8.50 for a full combination dinner that we could not eat. Will be having dinner tomorrow night, too. This will always be our first stop when we fly into Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Whole in the wall building and not so great location but the food is pretty good. This place is one of my family's favorite and have been around for a very long time. Love the pork fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Definitely a place to try if your in the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid! Wong's is such a great place, very noticeable from the street with its bright red exterior. The interior hasn't changed at all! I remember their huge refrigerator off to the side as a kid and that thing is still alive and kickin! It's definitely outdated but it's totally the charm of the place. 
Now for the food. I'm not gonna lie, I used to be extremely picky as a kid and would only get the teriyaki chicken or the house chicken. Now as an adult I've ventured off and tried new things. I think I've had everything on the menu at least once throughout my lifetime. My favorite dish currently is the Emperor's Favorite, chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies in a spicy white sauce. Yum! The soups are also amazing. I'm a huge fan of egg drop soup and Wong's just knows how to do it. If I were you I would also try the egg rolls, so good! and only $1 per egg roll! 

I'll always be a fan of Wong's and it will always be my go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"What are we giving stars for?

If its atmosphere I'll take back all four stars. This place loos like a gang hide away. 

If it's for food then cool. They deserve the 4 stars. Great food that's inexpensive!

Nothing else to say about it.

No need to dress up."}
{"text":"This place is so dodgy the inside looks really run down the corner of the walls I notice was very dirty( dust bunnies). I had placed a phone order and I told her to have the food ready before 6 ( I called a hour and a half early) because I have only a 30 min lunch break from work and when I got to the place she did not have anything ready and I had to wait 10 mins for my food and when we left with our food I notice she did not give us any forks or or chopsticks to eat. When we finally got to eat the food it was disgusting the orange chicken was like it was left out over night and they just popped it in the microwave to heat it up and the chow main was so oily i couldn't eat it but the cream puffs were okay I hope this place changes"}
{"text":"The interior of Wong's is pretty gross....when I'm waiting for my to-go order I usually count the number of giant cobwebs in the corner and try to guess their length in feet.  'Cuz they're HUGE.  

I don't care though, because their food is freaking amazing.  You HAVE to order the pan fried pot stickers - they're the best in town.  They have really good soups and cheap lunch specials as well. 

Also the exterior paint color seems to change every time I go, which makes me laugh.  Work it, Wong's."}
{"text":"Best Sizzling Rice soup! Everything else is pretty good too. The iced tea is also really delicious! The staff is always friendly. They are closed Sunday, and also close for a couple of hours during the day for lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. They have huge portions, friendly service, and delicious food for great prices. I always enjoy the sizzling rice soup which was easily be shared as an appetizer with 3 people, and their kung-pao chicken and chicken low mein never fails to make my stomach very happy."}
{"text":"This place looked very sketch but to my surprise it was delscious! The employees were beyond friendly.  The only thing I did not like was that they did not have sriracha, and the chili oil that they had was gross."}
{"text":"I love this place. it's divey and its in a bad part of town. (Their window has been shot out with a shotgun and you can still see the holes in the blind.) They have amazing soup. Their hot and sour soup is one of the best I've ever had. and the entrees and apps are good too. The prices are reasonable and the service is better than you would expect looking at the place. Wong's is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Looking for big portions?  

Looking for an inexpensive meal?

Don't mind going to a hole in the wall, no swank place?

Wong's is for you!

I had the shrimp & lobster sauce lunch combo.  It came with egg drop soup.  The style of cooking is a little different than what I am used to from places in the metro NYC area.  The lobster sauce was brown and not white.  Overall it was ok.

My lunch mate ordered orange chicken.  I tried a piece and it was outstanding! 

Bottom line:  I will return.  Don't be scared off by the look of the place. Friendly staff and good food at a great price.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"A friend who works at CPLC that's just down the road suggested that I try it out took it on faith that it would be ok. I was a little skeptical because the exterior went in after the lunch rush and ordered a combination plate really really good. The experience (food) took me back to the 1970's eating dinner with my parents having  Cantonese Chinese fare. As a matter of fact I'm taking the folks next week. You gotta give this place a try who would have known apparently most of Phoenix except for me. In closing the prices are super reasonable to."}
{"text":"Wow such a fantastic surprise. We read the good reviews and decided to give it a shot; the outside appearance and surrounding neighborhood almost made us turn back, but I'm so glad we didn't!
Food was delicious. The chicken and rice soup was my favorite. Best chicken soup I've ever had! Their orange chicken is awesome; get it. And the pot stickers were perfect. Nice thin skins, crispy bottoms, and juicy filling. We were less impressed with the Kung Pau beef. It was fine but not notably amazing like the other dishes. 
They were also playing some great swingy Christmas music on the radio, which we loved.
The prices are a steal. Ambiance is what you'd expect from the outside appearance; nothing fancy but pleasant. The staff is very friendly, and service was prompt. 
I find myself wanting to go back during my week-long vacation; it was that good! Go give this place your business. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very dependable flavorful Chinese food.The Orange chickene was delectable and the shrimp with lobster sauce was yummy.They even had Brown Fried Rice!!Everything was great."}
{"text":"Does not look like much from outside but great flavors. Had Orange chicken and chicken vegetable off the lunch menu. It's great have fresh cut vegetables instead of frozen ones."}
{"text":"I ordered the Wongs Beef Chaw Mein, it was ok. The food didn't look appetizing. Will I order from here again? Sure, but to go. Service was not awsome. Service I give it a 2 out of 5 just because they seemed to be too busy to try and explained the 100 things on their menu.  

They need to have such a quick customer turnover because of their small seating. So yeah they're trying to push you out as soon as possible."}
{"text":"If you judge by the outside you will never know how amazing the food is! I had the Orange Chicken.  It was so good. Lots of food for the price."}
{"text":"Love this place I had the orange chicken and hubby had beef and broccoli . price was a bout 8 bucks a plate and so much food took leftovers for lunch."}
{"text":"Wong's is my \"go-to\" place in downtown.  It is close to my office, they have a nice variety of lunch specials, the food is always good, the portions are huge and it is very reasonably priced.   Also, the owners and the folks who work there are wonderful.

There is nothing fancy about Wong's but they're always on point.  They'll treat you well and fill you up. 

You've probably driven by Wong's and wondered about the place.  One of these times stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is very unassuming from the looks on the outside. BUT! Don't let that fool you!! Once you step inside, you'll see that it will be packed with patrons who know that the food is delicious! The price is right for the food and the friendly service you get here!"}
{"text":"My first time at Wong's and I  must say it was delicious!!   The location is not in a busy district,  more off the beaten path.   One might just drive by and not give it a second look.   But,  it's a MUST try!   Great food,  good service!  Small location with small dining area.   Very busy with the locals.   Give it a try,  you will but regret it!!"}
{"text":"Tried the popo platter appetizer.  The shrimp and beef were tasty morsels. The chicken wings were extra crispy and drenched in a sauce similar to the orange chicken. I like my wings this crispy and be careful with that sauce you will be hooked and craving it fortnightly like the colonel's chicken. 
The star of our meal was the orange chicken.. crispy chicken chunks tasty orange sauce. The fried rice just does not disappoint. ... 
The others got the sweet and sour chicken.. it came on a separate plate because their rice and chow mein filled the plate.. they both commented that it was sparse on the sweet and sour chicken but both took home leftovers. 
All in all no complaints.. the usual great service."}
{"text":"First time ordering to go and I got the number 5 the pork fried rice was great and so was the orange chicken and egg roll. I ordered the egg fu young and the sauce wasn't what I am used to but not terrible. Appearance wise it's awful. But foods pretty good and on my way home. 


Just a update from my last review this place is just great the staff is lovely and the foods great my husband is so picky and he loves it I recommend immensely!  I just wanted to update and say live this place still! I ordered a Togo and as I waited the staff offered water with lemon as I wait! So sweet and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I drive ALL THE WAY from Maricopa to eat here, the food is that good!!!!! Our Chinese restaurants in Maricopa are AWFUL, please open one there!!!!! This place isn't very appealing to the eye, and can easily be overlooked lol but thats why I like it...the hole in the walls are always the best!!!! The food is always fresh, and made to perfection. Very good Chinese food is sooooo hard to find in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Best chinese in phoenix is so good. Must taste.. the shrimp chop suey. Brocoli beef and pork fry rice are my fav.  So yummy.."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest girl at the ball, but some of the best Chinese food I've had in the area.  Driving by one might think, \"Not stepping in there.\"  But a friend had been there and recommended it.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and was very pleasantly assured.  I tried the cashew chicken and my wife had the chicken lo mein.  Both dishes very tasty.  And tell me, how can you make shrimp egg rolls so good for just $1.39?  The egg drop soup is so very tasty as well!  2nd trip there was equally delicioso!  The crab Rangoons and the cashew shrimp, ohhhhhh sooooo good!  Our new 'go to' place for Chinese food.  Looking forward to our next visit!  One thing I forgot to mention, they do use a lot of zucchini.  Not my fav, but I just pick it out!"}
{"text":"Some things I have learned.  Their lunch combo's are NOT good.  The ala carte items are terrific.  I tend to stick to the chicken dishes and have not had a bad experience yet.  I really like their egg rolls."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but you might want to consider carrying a weapon when you come. You might end up getting shanked."}
{"text":"Even though the place looks a little rundown the staff is courteous and the food is delicious. Been coming here for years and love going there. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I thought I would take the chance. Yep got this one completely wrong. the place is an absolute dump. You would be better off eating your own hand. I got the teriyaki chicken. The chicken was unrecognizable nasty chunks of deep fried chicken dumped on brown liquid rice. The egg roll was not too bad I did eat that.  I could only eat a few bites of this teriyaki chicken. This was one of the worst Chinese restaurant I have eaten at in years."}
{"text":"After coming home from work not feeling so good, the husband graciously offered to pick up some Chinese food for us! Go him. Wong's happens to be fairly close to the house and we'd never tried it (due to its scary exterior), so we figured we'd go for it. I ordered the sizzling rice soup (which only comes in a large size for 7.50) and he ordered the sweet and sour chicken (about 8.50). My soup was steaming hot when it got to our house, so that was great, but the rice didn't really sizzle....weird for sizzling rice soup. It should be noted that the soup broth was more of a wonton broth (as opposed to other places that have more of an egg drop broth base) and contained large vegetables (that were fresh and tasty and included celery, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, etc), different meats and shrimp. The soup was sort of layered indicating (to me) that they cook the meat and veg separately from the broth and add it in later. All of the shrimp was at the bottom, followed by pork and chicken (and green onions), with veg on top. This was fine and probably wouldn't be the case if you ate the food at the restaurant. Overall it was a solid bowl of soup, better than a lot of restaurants, but still nothing I would really think about later. The husband's sweet and sour chicken was on the bland side... not very sweet... and the chicken was the typical fried puff balls of unknown chicken parts... he though it was ok, and I didn't care for it. For the prices, I would consider going back, but it wouldn't be first on my list."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was a bit worried when I drove up. The place is a complete hole in the wall. It just looks really bad but I looked in the windows as we drive by and my partner and I gathered up the courage to go in. Once I was in I was committed even though the inside was just as bad as the outside. I came cause I read the reviews and wanted to give it shot. We walked to the register area and the lady was really friendly asked for our order and even had the patience to make some suggestions. She made us feel welcome. 
I ordered a mild version of the pineapple chicken and the boyfriend ordered orange chicken. 

While we waited I read the negative review about the donut smelling food. I got worried again. The server brought our food out and told us she hoped we enjoyed our meal. She was very pleasant. 
We got home we ate our food an my plate was bland but I actually like it that way cause u don't like a lot of spice so for me it was good. The veggies were fresh and not over steamed just a light crisp which was nice. My boyfriends orange chicken did smell like donuts but that actually added to the sweet orange smell which was very pleasant. The chicken pieces were individually cut and friend unlike most places that fry the whole breast and then cut slices. I like this place.  Just afraid to go in.  :)"}
{"text":"I asked my husband how many stars to rate Wongs. His answer was \"four because the place is run down, but the food is good.\"  I disagreed. I feel like they're almost playing on the idea that the hole in the wall places are the best.  So they're not going to jinx themselves by remodeling.  To me, it's like they know it's the \"hole in the wall\" label that gives them their character.  It's clean and they're friendly so I'm not gonna mark them down.  And I don't need to tell you the food is fresh and delicious.  All the other reviews already did that."}
{"text":"The coconut chicken is amazing. The staff is super friendly and the lunch special is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Went there today with a couple of friends and was not disappointed! We were seated very promptly and our waitress was very eager to take our order. The place is really small, so it's understandable that they'd wanna move people through quickly. I ordered the House Special Chicken with a side of Crab Puffs. The Chicken meal was excellent and the portions were huge! Can totally get another couple meals and that's always a plus. Will definitely be going here again! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Wong's. If you look at this place from the outside, it looks like it's condemned, but it's really good. 

Normally I go there on the lunch hour and it fills up pretty quickly. Despite how it looks, it's very clean and safe. They have great lunch specials and I normally get the Orange Chicken, #15. With the lunch special, you get a cup of Egg Drop soup. Great service too. Even when they're busy I normally get my food very quickly and the staff is very attentive to their customers. 

They offer takeout - just call and tell them what you want. Since they have limited seating takeout is always a good option."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap, large portioned, greasy, fast lunch.....well then this is your place. If you decide to eat here, do yourself a favor and use their restroom. I guarantee you will have an authentic third world experience. The service here is Amazing. Everyone is friendly and the food comes out lightning fast. The egg drop soup is good, the rest, not so much. 

I ordered the combo Chicken Lo Mein. This plate comes with a decent tasting egg roll, and fried rice. When I say fried rice, I mean just that. It's brown colored flavorless rice. Nothing more, nothing less. Just rice. Everything was bland and coated in oil. Way too much oil. I spat out one oddly flavored bite of chicken and reluctantly continued eating. I was hungry, so I covered everything in soy sauce and continued my mission. 

I also ordered the Crab Puffs. I love crab puffs. These are not CRAB puffs. They are CHEESE puffs. Greasy, bland cream cheese wontons. I only ate two. The rest went into the trash. 

I can say with great certainty that the service is nice and welcoming, but the facility and the food seem to be out to kill you. The fortune cookie was the best part of my meal. Well, the polite staff was nice too. Not nice enough to get me back in the door though. Soooo, thanks for the let down Yelpers. 4 stars? I think not."}
{"text":"There are only approx. 5 parking spots in front of the restaurant. Most customers either park at the dirt lot or on the small street next to it. It isn't a big place for huge parties. Total of 5-6 booths and 5-6 tables. The restaurant usually gets very packed up between 12pm - 12:30pm. 

I usually come here during business lunch hour. Their Lunch combo is less than $10. It includes a egg roll, crab cake and small meal that includes rice or noodles. Since I am spoiled with authentic Chinese cuisine, I am disappointed that they don't serve authentic dishes such as Ma Po Tofu or Singapore noodles etc. This Chinese restaurant certainly caters more to customers in the general area only. Service is generally super fast and staffs are polite/nice. The restaurant is a bit run down and definitely needs some work on fixing up. I spoke with the owner several times and he is always there working. 

I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I love supporting locals but yet wish they would have made more improving on their menus. All in all I think is restaurant is average."}
