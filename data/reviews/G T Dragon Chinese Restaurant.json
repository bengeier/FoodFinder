{"text":"As far as Chinese goes in Georgetown, this place is probably the better choice. Service is quick, and the food is always hot! If you spend over $25 you get a bonus app (wings, wontons etc).  We've sampled just about everything. As with most Canadian Chinese places many of the sauces are similar. The General Taos is good, similar to the ginger chicken. We wish you could order half portions (especially of the sweet and sour chicken).   You get a decent portion of meat with your order, could use some more veggies! Ho fun and Cantonese noodles are all good. Need dishes are good (pepper, broccoli).   They were the only place opened during the ice storm (2014) and made yummy food when we had nothing to eat!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food in Georgetown. But.. not bad?   I got a pick up order and for the portion sizes- the prices were warranted.  Though, I asked for pad Thai and what I received was not pad Thai, I'm still not sure what it was haha  Large menu so great selection, vegetarian options and 'healthier' options as well.  The spring rolls tasted like play dough/chemically??  The low mein was good, the chicken balls my family said were good as well.   The food isn't bad but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Though the portions were large, everything tastes the exact same... The sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken, General tsao chicken. They were bland, oily and just coated in a unbalanced red sweet sauce. There is no depth of flavour and no distinguishing factors in the dishes so when ordering from their menu, don't worry if you'll like one item more than the other because, frankly, it will all taste the same. Service was great."}
{"text":"Food is average, service is poor.  We ordered a small take-out meal for the first time, as we live around the corner.  However, they managed to forget one of the three dishes.  They said we could come back to get it (gee, thanks for offering to deliver YOUR mistake).  When we eventually picked up the dish, the owner made a point of explaining that the dish was smaller because it was part of a combo.  Wow!  Now THAT'S customer service!  Most restaurants with a modicum of respect would apologize (nope!) and offer some rice or something for having put us out of our way.  Not here.  They give you less food.  We'll stick to The Hakka Place on Guelph next time... always spectacular food and excellent service.  Bye-bye GT Dragon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I order take out from GT Dragon at least once a month!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of chow mien when done right and GT dragon does it right. Good quality and value on the family dinners.  Hits the spot when you want some classic Canadian Chinese."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite Chinese place ever! The portions feed me 3 meals at least. Everything is so tasty! I will continue to order from there!"}
