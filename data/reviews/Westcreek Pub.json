{"text":"I used to be a regular at Westcreek, and recently received such poor service from the owner that I will NEVER return. We arrived to a busy pub with four in our group. There was one table left, which seated 6. We were told by the owner that only groups of five or more could sit there. There was not another table free to accomadate our group, so we left. Meanwhile, the owner sat at the other table for six, with two friends. I just wish I would have realized how little his regular customers were valued before I lined his pockets with my hard earned money.

Mediocre food, horrible service. I gave it one star because I had to."}
{"text":"OMFG. The service here is terrible.  Staff are rude and the owner and his ugly wife were completely drunk and obnoxious. I will never return to this urine smelling run down shithole ever again."}
{"text":"Been 2 times once for lunch and 2 time we had breakfast. Had a burger for lunch it was very good but everything on it was not fresh my tomato, lettuce and even the onion were old! How do they think they can give old food and expect people to eat or even pay for it?
Had breakfast how hard it it to make toast and eggs? Toast was so cold the butter did not melt and the eggs were slimy (raw). When we asked the server if we could have a cooked egg she was so annoyed so I asked her to have a bite she said I would never eat here??????  

Service & Food is terrable. Chestermere lacks any good place to eat;"}
{"text":"Completely average in every way. Maybe a bit below. Food was ok, but didn't sit completely well. Service was fine. Was very empty as we were the only ones there. Eating area was cleanish. Went in really hoping to find a new good weekend breakfast spot, but I certainly don't think it is going to take that title."}
{"text":"I love the Westcreek pub! They have wing nights on Wednesdays and Thursdays which is fabulous. They also feature their Westcreek burger with either a Caesar salad or french fries and they have the best poutine with bacon and green onions on top!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings in a huge variety of tasty flavours. Don't miss wing nights on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Also, their steak and lobster is terrific and available on Friday and Saturday nights. My personal fave is the WestCreek Burger. I highly recommend visiting and trying something from their diverse menu."}
