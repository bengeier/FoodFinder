{"text":"I was looking for a place for a place to eat on here and saw that people reviewed it, giving it fairly good reviews. So, I went and grabbed take out from here. I ordered the carnitas from here. The carnitas were good and a hearty portion. I do wish that there was a bit more heat or kick to them and their salsa, but it was good. I was gonna go with a burger or, because it was early enough, I was going to get something like waffles, but I was curious to see how their Mexican food was. The place is a cute little place with, as people have said, an eclectic menu. They had good service with an attentive staff. I think next time I'll go back and try their burgers or breakfast food."}
{"text":"This place is like cheers I suppose,  or even Denny's. It's small but seems to fill up nicely around lunch. I was halfway through the diner when I was told seat where ever I want, then my server came and gave me a menu. She was nice, seemed quite. I got their chicken sandwich...however it had teriyaki sauce on it? Umm wasn't happy with that but I was very kind and the server fixed it...she didn't replace it but scrapped it off and gave me a new bottom bun. The sauce was still on some of the chicken. It was a decent size, couldn't finish it all. Overall it is a nice place for comfort eating or if you don't want to dress up and be bothered, but that's it."}
{"text":"The staff there were rude and chatty. I took my mother, sister, nieces, step son and fiancé there to enjoy for lunch. First is was the glass I was drinking out of had lipstick stains on the rim, so I re-ordered a new clean glass of soda. I wasn't upset or throw a fit about it, but as soon as I turned my back at the counter the girls there instantly started complaining about it. They didn't seem to care that I could hear them, but I didn't bother. But as we got our meal, two orders weren't right the waitress had to re order and resubmit our ticket. So we waited another 30 minutes, by then everyone was done eating. I again let it slide, but when the waitress served us our meal she looked at me and with an attitude she asked \"is there anything I can get for you your highness?\" Instantly I was upset and requested to speak to a manager. When the manager came she instantly said \"what is it now?!\" I replied \"what is your issue with me? We just asked for our meal and the two orders were wrong and I had to reorder a clean glass of soda. I did nothing wrong and I didn't throw a fit.\" Instantly she stated that according to her staff I was being rude and demanding and my staff does not need that kind of attitude from anyone. I told her over and over again that I didn't give any of your staffs members any attitude and nor was I rude. She asked if there was anything else I would like and turned away to go back to the kitchen. So when we got the bill we were charged for the re orders and the clean glass of soda and they automatically added the gratuity to the order. I was so upset I just paid to get out of there and I never felt so humiliated and felt that it was u fair that I paid for the full meal and their mistake and not to mention the attitude from the staff. I been there twice before and never had an issue. Let's just say I'll be avoiding the place and never would refer anyone to eat there. I hope they don't treat any customers like that, that was very disappointing and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh diner food. Yummy waffles, eggs and crispy bacon, fluffy pancakes, Huevos Rancheros, tuna melt, burgers. An Old Town experience, representing some of how it probably was in the 50's and 60's.  Kinda quaint, a little bit kitschy. They don't pretend to be something they're not!   People are very nice. There's a brother and sister who serve tables that are super! Has a family-run feel to it.  I discovered Paula last year. She is a world-class award winning yoddler, the real deal from Brandon, Mo. Now, I knew nothing about this music until Paula, and is not my fav genre still. But I have to say she followed her dreams, achieved accolades for her work, and has a passion for it that should put her naysayers to shame. Live music is never a bad idea.She reminded me of Dale Evans and Roy Rogers from when we we kids. And I surprised myself by knowing some of the songs! Like Willy Nelson, Tammy Wynette's Stand By Your Man.She does requests. It was fun for the whole family, all ages.  Overall, it makes for a unique old western experience, I think folks will enjoy!   Plus they deliver to the local area, great value!"}
{"text":"The food is probably great if you eat at the restaurant, but I had a horrible experience while ordering online.  The order arrived about 35 minutes after we placed the order but one of the items was missing.  We called and they said they would send the driver back, but 40 minutes later we were still waiting on the missing burrito.  That is unacceptable service.  The food we did get was pretty cold. I would not recommend getting the food delivered."}
{"text":"I was visiting Old Town one evening, and my family and I decided to have some dinner before returning to the hotel. After walking around a few blocks, we decided on David's; it looked family friendly and seemed like a non-national chain dining facility, something I was gunning for on my cross-country road trip.  We ordered 2 of their pulled pork taco specials and a salad. While none of these dishes were particularly special, they all tasted great. The pulled pork tacos came with 3 tacos, beans, rice, and a lovely dollop of guacamole and sour cream. The salad was huge, a wonderful portion for its price.  Service was good, too; food came out in a timely fashion. All together, no complaints! Good for families!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner in this small diner. The staff was very kind. The food was delicious. We all had burgers. Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Total diner type with great, greasy burgers. This burger is perfect for a hangover. I think the best gourmet burger in old town is Rehab, but David's is the best greasy one. They also have great breakfast.  Ordering from Eatstreet or GrubHub is also excellent. They go above and beyond for delivery."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it was late (11p), hadn't had dinner yet, and wanted something better than jack in the box. We pulled over to search yelp and as luck would have it, David's was right behind us.  We opted for burgers this time, but I'm sure we'll be back to try the mexican half of the menu. My wife loved her texas burger, and I was impressed with the thick guacamole and perfectly cooked bacon on my guac burger. Very filling. We also got a strawberry malt. Judging from taste and the presence of seeds at the very bottom of the cup: made with strawberries, not just flavouring!"}
{"text":"Best patty melt ever! Everything I've had here is delicious. The decor isn't fancy at all, but the friendly attentive service makes up for that."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburgers in Scottsdale.  Period.  No, you cant add peanut butter, chipotle mayo, gruyere cheese or artichoke hearts, but if you are looking for an outstanding double cheeseburger with no frills under $9, this is the place.  Fries are fantastic, as well.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the service is hit or miss.  Lots of newbie employees and sometimes service is extremely slow, but the food is consistently delicious.  Open super late on the weekends as an added bonus.  I also love the art for sale by local artists - nice touch."}
{"text":"David's has the best shakes, at least i think they do.  They are served in old fashioned milkshake glasses and youngest the container they are blended in.  You can get flavored sodas like an old fashioned soda fountain.  I usually get vanilla coke, sometimes cherry coke. I have always eaten in.  The breakfasts are decent.  My only objection was with the fried potatoes.  It looked like they had taken french fries and diced them up and fried them.  Kind of disappointing as i am a big fan oh home fries with real potatoes. Definitely worth a visit in my book."}
{"text":"Our experience was, \" Horrible !!!!!!\"  We ordered a Cheese Sandwich and a Enchilada Plate. We waited 25 minutes and our order never came. We flagged down the waitress and told her we still hadn't gotten our order? She asked, \"who took your order?\" We said, \"You!\" She never put the order in! We said we were just going to leave, she said, \"Ok!\" We left! We should have known when we walked in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and only 10 people were in the restaurant. \"Terrible customer service!\" No service!"}
{"text":"My biggest problem with David's is its identity. First is the menu. It's a fusion of 50's style dinner food and Mexican. Then there's the decor. It's neither 50's nor Mexican. Oh sure, oldies, mostly 50's play on the sound system but that's where the correlation between the menu and decor ends. To their credit David's does put out a great burger and the tacos aren't bad either. The chips are served warm and the salsa is actually homemade and quite tasty. I've been here twice and both times there were no more than 3 tables occupied. Even so the service isn't great. If your timing is good you might pass by when the owner is outside handing out 20% coupons. David's is nestled between the high priced trinket shops and restaurants of touristy Old Town Scottsdale. Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive"}
{"text":"We ate there for lunch over President's weekend.  We sat at the counter, as the restaurant was full.  The place has a 50s diner feel.  They had live music, which was fun.  Our burgers were good and service was OK  And the meal was affordable.  The only complaint is that we had an ENTERTAINMENT coupon and rather than removing one of the burgers (buy one get one free) from our bill, they deducted the price by hand and left the tax on it."}
{"text":"Wow-I'm really surprised that this place got as many good ratings as it has.  I had a single cheese burger which was really bad.  The patty was thin, over cooked, and the cheese was not melted.  The fries were fair but I think they were frozen prior.  There were not many people in the place at lunch time as well.  I would be surprised if this place is still around in 6 months."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 10 minutes /waiter acknowledged us and said he would be back / continued to ignore us so we left"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Was called first to be told the driver didn't have change. Ok. We could handle that. Then, called to be asked where we lived on a couple occasions, as they got my address wrong and the driver was at a different location.  After all that, the food was cold. The bacon cheese fries were one huge blob of bacon bits and some cheese situation. The French dip as ok. May have been better if it wasn't cold. My rolled tacos where super soggy and left much to be desired.  Not impressed!"}
{"text":"Had a great diner style cheeseburger today, and will definitely go back.   Tillamook cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and thousand island style sauce. The fries that came with it were what I would call steak fries.    This was a take-out order via the livingsocial.com website.   This was my first visit, mainly due to the name of the place...had always wondered if a \"Mexican Hamburger\" place would actually be good..."}
{"text":"We are staying in Scottsdale for 1 night and found David's Hamburgers.  We each had a \"wonderful\" hamburger and he also had a Malt.    They had 2 small tables out front , which is where we sat with our dog.   We liked this place, as it has good food, close to where we stayed and the price did not break our travel bank.   Louis was the waiter and he kept checking on us and refilling the water, since we were outside.   I would come again next time I'm here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update this for a while. I gave them another try, because they have delivery (only $10 minimum, and $1 delivery fee, I believe). I tried a burger instead of Mexican food, and WOW! What a vast improvement! Their burgers are huge, tons of great choices, comes with a side, and the prices are VERY reasonable."}
{"text":"Very good value, excellent service.  We had the texas burger and the cheese enchiladas.  Both were great.  We arrived just before noon on a Friday and it wasn't busy at all.  Sounded like they do a busy takeout."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from David's. I have this unspoken agreement with local restaurants- I will continue to pay them for their food up until the moment that they decide that they don't want my money. There are myriad ways to get this point across- they could bring my food half an hour late with no explanation or apology, which of course means cold food. They could also change the quality of food for the worse, that's a big one. They could also overcharge me and refuse to apologize for their mistake.   However, it seems that David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food wants me to continue to give them money, because the quality of the food is consistent and delicious, the delivery is right around the proposed time, and the customer service is perfect. I will continue to shove your food into the lowest hole in my head at this rate.  Also- their hot pastrami sandwich is the best I've had on this bloody coast."}
{"text":"This place has really taken a nose dive! I use to order about three times a month, and my last orders have been awful. The food had no flavor and they have mixed up and forgotten parts of my order. Today was the last straw. When I received my food everything was spilled in the bag. My eggs bacon and potatoes were covered in banana    Juice. My French toast looked dry and unappetizing. The cheese steak was on regular bread and it was basically just one giant piece up steak not even cut up with the bone still in it.  To make the matter worse it took them almost 40 minutes to deliver my food. I will never order from them again which is sad because I use to recommend them to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I ordered a French dip today, the meat smelled bad as soon as I opened the box, I was so hungry I started eating it and spit it out, I called and they kept trying to make an excuse, I told them I know rotten meat and this was rotten they replaced it (which took forever) rolled tacos and the rice wasn't even cooked!!!! I had given the delivery girl the rotten meat back and still a excuse she didn't bother to even look at the green meat....never will I eat there again.....becareful!!! ...the french dip sandwich should have never been put in a box....again horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's tucked away, but don't let that stop you. We order from here a lot, and their food is awesome! I've had the bacon-onion ring- bbq sauce burger more thatn I can remember, and I can NEVER make the same thing at home! Kudos guys, and keep up the speedy service!"}
{"text":"Walked past this place the other day looking for a quick bite to eat that was nothing fancy.  The place was nearly empty on a Friday afternoon around lunch time.  There was really no theme from a decor perspective other than an under funded diner in the \"middle of no-where\" in the middle of America struggling to make ends meet.  Bare walls with no even any art up and the back wall had some exposed electrical wiring.  Well, this is not in the \"middle of no-where\" but rather the middle of Scottsdale and I expected a bit more.  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a true.  The server was very attentive and kind.  I asked her what was good here and the suggestion was the Davids Burgers and anything Mexican on the menu.  I choose the David's Burger, thinking the signature item with the owners name on it would be at least good.  I was wrong, the burger bland, too much lettuce and onions and there was a thick slice of cheese the was dry and completely clashed with the rest of the burger.  Furthermore, the bun was not even warm.  Come'on guys at least put the bun on the grill and warm it up a bit.    As much as I tried to fairly have this place a second star, I just could not."}
{"text":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible customer service! This is the only delivery place that has breakfast; I don't have a car. I have ordered from this place at least 6 times, each time a bad experience. I understand people having a bad day, but not once have I talk to someone on the phone without attitude or treating me like I am inconveniencing them. They have never delivered to me on time, EVER! I ordered for delivery online a few mins past 9am. It said my delivery would be here at 9:58am. I wait until 1030am to call and ask them where my food is. The guy said \"He left about 10 mins ago. He should be there any minute. If he doesn't know up in the next 15, I will call to find out where my driver is.\" ..... ooookay.... 10 mins go by, the delivery guy shows up at my door. Almost irritated, no smile, no apology. I ordered a Two by Four (2 scrambled eggs with 4 pancakes), hot chocolate and vanilla iced coffee with extra x2 vanilla. The eggs and pancakes are luke warm, not to mention I only got 3 pancakes, the bacon is cold and dry, and the coffee was iced black coffee. Terrible."}
{"text":"I can't imagine I am even talking about the same restaurant that some of the other reviews describe.  Driving down Scottsdale Road looking for a breakfast spot, we noticed a young lady holding a sign advertising David's, so we went around the block and went in.  Sunday morning, 9:30am.  There were quite a few customers seated.  First impression was...this must be good!  NOT!!! No one greeted us.  We took the last booth available. (still other tables available) After at least 10 minutes a young wait person asked if we wanted coffee.  We said yes, and cream please.  Soon heard the next booth being told there was no coffee available...it was brewing.  Coffee arrived maybe 10 minutes later....sans cream.  Asked for cream again.  Nothing arrived.  We took some from an empty table. Finally the person came to take our order.  Most of the staff looked dirty, and needed to either throw away, or at least wash their shirts.  Disgusting.  Looked like they had been working in the kitchen overnight, they were splattered with food.  Not exactly appetizing. We saw many more groups of people come in....stand around waiting for direction to a table, or at least be spoken to.  The staff seldom offered help, or even a hello.  I couldn't believe how many customers just turned around and walked out.   Finally...the food arrives.  My waffle had a blob of frozen butter sitting on top.  The syrup was ice cold.  The 2 eggs (over easy) had been fried to a crisp...the edges were brown and burnt.  The bacon was overdone and cold. My dining partner had an omelet which he described as 'just okay'.  The potatoes served with it were described as just nasty, greasy. The table of 4 ladies that sat behind us waited forever...with no water or coffee...but finally got to order some breakfast.  A burrito was delivered to their table with no salsa.  I heard the customer ask for salsa....twice.  Never did arrive.  Another lady was complaining her toast never arrived. Server said he couldn't remember what kind of toast she wanted.  The lady said just bring me SOMETHING please.  Never did see toast arrive. We could see that many of the other diners were very unhappy with their experience also. Other tables were complaining because there was never any coffee ready. Can they only brew ONE pot at at time??  For a restaurant full of breakfast customers?? And they needed more staff. I made the comment this place needs to be featured on the TV show...Restaurant Impossible. This is not the way to run a restaurant.  Really. This is \"season\" in downtown Scottsdale!! People come here to spend money!! Very disappointing to see a restaurant floundering....that could and should have turned those table probably 3 times in the time we spent there....if it were managed and staffed properly. When we paid our check and walked out, I noticed we had been sitting in there almost 2 hours.  No....we will not be going back to David's again."}
{"text":"The biggest problem preventing this establishment from success is CURB APPEAL. It just looks REALLY cheap. The exterior window displays look absolutely wretched. Whoever created the visual elements that are supposed to lure in customers just has no imagination and seems unwilling to spend any money on improvements. Too bad, since the food is quite good. I took my son and we both were impressed. I'd actually passed this place hundreds of times before finally dropping in. And I think that revelation speaks for itself. It just lacks appeal. Once inside, the staff appeared somber, which always unnerves me. Were they surprised to see customers in the middle of the afternoon? I think they were!  Again, I must comment on design elements; this time, inside. The interior is as uninspired as the front window displays. The restaurant is long and desperately needs mirrors. It tries to look 50's, but just comes off like cheap plastic masquerading as chrome. Here's a tip: Drop the hideous yellow wall paint and draw your inspiration from authentic 50's dinners. Frame some original movie posters; get an old motorcycle in there. Do something!  Its sad really, this is the only diner in the area, so they're just hurting themselves. People want this place to succeed. They also do NOT have a liquor license, so that's gonna be an automatic deal-breaker for some patrons."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! The service is great and EVERY item on the menu is amazing! I first found this place searching for online deliveries on grub hub and had to see what the restaurant is all about. Although it's not aesthetically appealing, the environment still makes it a great place to dine and the employees are more dedicated to making their customers happy than most."}
{"text":"The shakes and onion rings were rather yummy, I won't lie. The burgers aren't to die for but there are no complaints; over all its a pretty good hole in the wall type of place."}
{"text":"Long story how we ended up there, but after ordering lunch for a homeless man, the smell of charbroiled burgers got the best of me. The burger was fine, the fries were less than desirable, but the malted milk shake made it all better! I'm sure David thinks he's on to something here - cooking fresh burgers at a very reasonable price (and friendly service), but I have had better burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"Don't let the unimpressive facade fool you. David's has very good food - both Mexican and American fare.  The food is fresh and prepared well. The staff is very friendly and makes for a pleasant stay!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Got take out today for lunch. I love the selection of food on the menu. I got the patty melt on sourdough bread with chili cheese on my fries.  It was really good and filling. I couldn't finish it by myself so I shared it. Thank you Gabriella and your Mom. Food was ready right as we got there. Great fast service and good food! Will be back with family and friends."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  What a find!  Great service, Reasonable price and nice environment. We both had the Texas Burger and found it to be excellent.... Interesting combination adding a French Fried Onion Ring to a burger with BBQ sauce and cheese. One of the best burgers in town.  Next time we'll carry out and enjoy our lunch at one of the week end concerts at the park down the street."}
{"text":"It was the only place in town open at the hour and the food was really good. And it had burgers AND Mexican!  It was greasy, but that's the way I like it. Some of my friends claimed to have gotten sick afterwards, but based off what we were doing earlier in the day, and throughout the night, I think there were other circumstances. (I was the DD and didn't get sick.) Our server was really attentive, bringing refills quickly and whatnot. And I thoroughly enjoyed my burger and fries. The place was really clean, too!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Just off of Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale.  Good food, great prices and very helpful employees.  They deliver if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Best \"Texas Burger\" ever!  Side of onion rings and delivered to my door in 20 minutes at 5pm?!?  Do it!"}
{"text":"The food was OK.  Our waitperson was very pleasant and attentive.  Not writing the order down for 7 guests created food delays, mix up on who got what.  Please visit David's, just be sure your waitperson has a paper and pen."}
{"text":"I found this place while looking for a fairly inexpensive place to eat and decided to wing it.   Walking in, I was shocked to see how dead it was for a Saturday night and I'll admit I started to wonder if this place was going to be worse than my expectations but I took a seat. I like that they sell art from local artists but overall the decor looked pretty run down. Just needs a little sprucing up.   I ordered a Route 87 cheeseburger and added an egg. The description appeared to be my favorite burger from Jonny Rockets (coincidently named the Route 66) which I also add an egg to.   It arrived it was everything I hoped it would be. The taste was almost exactly like Johnny rockets. Yyuumm!! The fries were a bit cold but edible.   The highlight for me, however, was my waitress. She was attentive and so very friendly, checking on me frequently , ensuring my coke was always full. In fact, she kindly offered a to go cup as I was leaving. Score! I wish I had gotten her name because she was a star."}
{"text":"I am mostly vegetarian and typically eat really healthy. I was due for a cheat day and was craving a burger but didn't feel like driving anywhere. After seeing the mixed reviews for this place I was skeptical ordering a burger but decided to go for it and went with the Guacamole Burger and Deluxe Oreo Malt.  For delivery this was a solid burger. I was happy with my choice. The guacamole was pretty good. It was hard to tell if it was freshly prepared at the restaurant or store bought. If it was store bought it was of higher quality. I love avocado/guacamole and I can't stand most store bought/pre made guac. The burger was good size and well proportioned. There was a good ration of bun to meat to toppings. The lettuce and tomato was fresh and the meat was slightly pink in the middle and tasty. I love burgers but they need to be well proportioned and not have a huge bun or tons of lettuce to make it look big. This was done right. Next time I'd go with no mayo. It just doesn't need it as it's already a juicy burger. The fries were ok, nothing too special but decent fries I gladly ate. The Oreo malt was pretty solid. A good blend of oreo and vanilla and a good size which I was expecting for $4.25. I'd order from here again"}
{"text":"I would have said four but my son upped it to a five because of the milkshakes. I have to admit those were good. Burgers were good, big and hot, fries were... eh. Atmosphere was okay but could use some touch up paint and a little attention to detail here and there. Service was good and very friendly. We didn't use the restroom."}
{"text":"I was impressed with David's Hamburgers and Mexican food. The building is a cozy little 50's themed outlet in Scottsdale. The music matched the decor and was enjoyable. The place was clean, not spotless, but clean.   I ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.  What really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.  To conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery today from here and the food was terrible. Their \"thick cut bacon\" was nothing but a bunch of burnt pieces of bacon. Omelet was soo salty that it was like it was done on purpose as a joke...itonly tasted like salt. Breakfast potatos were just chopped up French fries! Cold and soggy as well. I called to get a refund and the girl didn't seem to care amd im still currently waiting for someone to call me back for my refund.I only gave them 1 star because it won't let you pick 0. Won't order from there again."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing. Service was excellent. Definitely going back next time I'm in the area. Bacon cheese fries are a must."}
{"text":"This place is great! We've lived in Old Town Scottsdale for 6 years and this is our go to spot for breakfast delivery. They always arrive on time or earlier than quoted, food and coffee always piping hot and 100% accurate. Delivery people and order takers always friendly. It's a great place for out of towners too...real old school diner feeling with malts and shakes.  Oh, and the chili fries are just like the ones from Coney Island in Detroit where I grew up!"}
{"text":"I ordered from grub hub, this place has amazing food!!! I got my order very fast, great burger and hot fries, the apple pie was absolutely perfect, and my cookies and cream milkshake was on point.  AND IT WAS DELIVERED!;) yay! I will definitely be ordering again, I would give five stars but one thing really annoyed me, this is sort of a huge pet peeve of mine... If you are making a hamburger for the love of god please get a bun that is bigger than the burger!!! I hate it when the burger falls off the edge and you end up just eating half a burger patty... Other than that small criticism, I loved everything.  Oh, hunts ketchup is kinda gross though;)"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery, and received in about 30 minutes. Not bad. Plus this food is delicious. I ordered the guacamole burger, fries, chocolate peanut butter shake, and a house salad. The salad is the typical lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, and the fries - well they're fries, nothing special. But the chocolate peanut shake and the burger are super tasty! The burger was loaded with guac, bacon - YUM! I'd definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Breakfast delivery that is all I have to say. The only place that I know that does this around here. Really good shakes too."}
{"text":"This Place is Much More than It's Name!  My wife and I have been to David's several times, for both lunch and dinner. I has a special charm of its own, in an interesting old building, and David can tell you a harrowing story about its history.   Their signature burgers are really good. Their soups are good. Every breakfast we have had there was good. Better than good.   But I think the name \"David's Hamburgers\" undersells this place that's certainly deserving of your business. For one thing, people don't associate hamburgers with breakfast. I think a better name for this restaurant would be \"David's Diner.\" Such a broad name would help grab the attention of diners early in the morning, as well as during other parts of the day and evening. Doesn't everyone love an old fashioned diner?  Try this place. You'll like it!"}
{"text":"Tonight I decided to stay in and do my homework and order from Davids hamburgers - they have delicious food and I didn't want to cook. I did my order and paid and I got a notification that it'd be here by 6:25pm and it is now 7pm. Thirty mins late, I am upset and starving at this point  so I called the restaurant. I spoke to a boy and I told him I want a refund and to keep the food - he didn't apologize for the wait or say I understand why your upset but instead he left me on hold for over 10 minutes. I am beyond disappointed since I am a regular here, I also have my whole bank ordering from them while we work. I will no longer give them a cent of my money and I will make sure everyone that wants to order from them if it's my family, friends, co workers.. I will make sure they don't waste their time and money on this place."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to burgers. I wasn't expecting much when i ordered the David's burger and boy, was I in for a surprise. Freshly ground beef patties grilled to perfection . This spot is $$$$$ in taste but not in price :D"}
{"text":"Trying to get a hold of the owner I have a great opportunity for you. I am a local restaurant owner as well in Phoenix. Send me a message and let's discuss details"}
{"text":"I gave David's 2 stars because the food is good, and delivery is generally very fast when we order in the office But... I would not actually recommend dining in. Today a coworker and I decided to give it a shot and dine in, we order in the office all the time and love the food. When we first arrived we were told we could seat ourselves but every table was dirty. an employee came by and cleaned the table we wanted to sit at and then took our drink order. The same girl then took our order a few minutes later we asked for  separate checks and ordered our lunch.  We waited close 30 min for our orders consisting of chicken Fajitas for my friend and, a slice of Cheese cake for me. She did not bring the extra plate my coworker requested or the side of sour cream she ordered, and beyond that she also did not refill our drinks. We finally asked the other employee working if he could bring us the requested items. He got our servers attention and she finally got the items. She had been busy talking on her cell phone and be bopping around she only had one other table it was pretty dead in there actually. When she did she finally noticed our cups needed to be refilled she refilled them with the wrong beverages my friend was drinking Coke and Got a refill of Ice tea. I finally asked for our check because if we didn't get it soon we would be late back to work, big Shocker she did not do separate checks as requested. Really she may have been the worst server I have ever had. I am beginning to wonder if that is just the way it is when you dine in at Scottsdale restaurants, two times this week I went out for lunch near my work and both times it was worse than the other.    Now the food as always was really tasty but the service was so piss poor I can honestly say I will never dine in again.  delivery only !!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for take out in Old Town.  I'm only giving it three stars because they've messed up my order a couple times and the food is good, not great but an excellent value regarding the amount of food you get for the price you pay. I usually go for the heavy \"Texas Burger\" donned with cheese, bacon, bbq sauce and onion rings with a side of fries.  Again, great value for the amount of food but the quality isn't top notch. I'm also a bit confused as to why they have a woman singing in there during lunch time. That would keep me from eating at their restaurant because it's both loud and a bit uncomfortable since the music she's singing is so out of style that I don't think my grandparents would even enjoy it. I'm sure they lady has a great time doing it and makes money with it, just not my taste.  If you're looking for cheap takeout with crispy fries and large burgers, hit up David's. They'll even deliver but it takes much longer for your food to arrive than if you were to call it in and pick it up. Plus, the one time I've had it delivered it all showed up soggy."}
{"text":"Uhhmmm burger!  Everything tastes fresh even the toppings. Oh well I should limit that \"everything\" to the hamburger and apple pie. The fries: yikes! I'm thinking I should have ordered the day before if I wanted to get fries from the same day. It's okay though. The delivery guy was cool and the burger is huge, so just top the meal off with that delicious apple pie (hold the fries), and you'll be satisfied. I hope anyway."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered delivery from here last week when I discovered the unfortunate lack of delivery options in the area we were staying in. We were a little nervous about the lackluster reviews, but decided to take a chance on the carne asada fries and a couple orders of the chicken tacos.  Our food arrived within the delivery window and was both hot and fresh. The food portions were massive, we probably should have split the order of tacos! The tacos were served on a hard corn tortilla and topped with a mountain of chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado. The fries were tasty, the steak cuts were very well seasoned.   Overall we were pleased with the food, it wasn't the sort of thing I'd come back for, but it was a good and reliable late night option!"}
{"text":"Cheap Mexican and American food, open late. What's not to love? Lol. Hard to find a cheap, basic restaurant in old town. Old diner feel. Great for a decent, quick, or late bit to eat."}
{"text":"I would recommend. My friend got the David's burger and thought it was pretty good, I felt the same way about my French dip. Our waiter was great, very friendly and genuine. They have good hours I'm sure I'll be back.  Food: Ok Service: Great"}
{"text":"It's all about the burgers (but also fajitas are good). That's what I'm basing the review on. The green chile cheeseburgers are some of the best we have had and compete with New Mexico. Special sauce is delicious. Again, great roasted green chile cheeseburgers!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I had the burger and it was big and it was good.  I'm not saying it was the best burger I've ever had, but I'd much rather support this Old Town Scottsdale standby than a fast food chain around the corner.  The service was friendly, and I dig the 50's vibe they've got going on.  I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would... First off, all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER, but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered. Then our orders started getting messed up (one time there was a whole burger missing) and then this girl started answering the phone to take orders that I couldn't understand and she couldn't understand me. Today I have OFFICIALLY HAD ENOUGH!!! We called in our order (keeping it as simple as possible), they have stopped carrying Mr. Pibb (which is my friend's fav) and talked to me like I was an idiot about it. FOR ONCE I was given a short & reasonable estimated delivery time... Then my phone rang and I was told that my order would have to be picked up if we still wanted it & they were under new management and will no longer be delivering to our office b/c it's too far away... Meanwhile another group JUST ordered from them on Monday! And our whole office gives them a LOT of business and they just dumped us like that? Nope... Never again..."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant and no one acknowledged us. Worst customer service I ever experienced! Horrible choice if you are expecting service."}
{"text":"Good burgers, excellent fries, good service. What else needs to be said?  Limited parking. Kinda pricey. Basically this place is for the tourists.  Out of the tourist season you might have this place to yourself at lunch time. Makes me wonder how much longer it will be around..."}
{"text":"I stopped in her one afternoon and was pleasantly surprised.   The decor is fun---50's diner  themed.  The service was good.    I ordered the enchiladas which were good!   I probably should have ordered a burger but the server suggested their Mexican food and it wasn't bad!"}
{"text":"Just off the main drag but well worth the little walk to get there. GREAT FOOD,  SERVICE AND PRICES. Much better food quality and larger portions than higher priced fancy places. Down home atmosphere, good music and friendly, courteous staff ( not over bearing or inattentive). Would go back in a minute if I was closer. Great ending to my vacation."}
{"text":"Want 1 1/2 hour delivery? Want cold burgers? If so, David's Hamburgers is YOUR place. So, let's start with a story. My brother, his Fiancé, and I were rather hungry and he recommended this joint called, David's. So, I did your standard ordering and got the confirmation that it'll be 30-45 minutes from the manager. Oh, the lies! After an hour, I called and asked where my food was. Only natural right? I threw $35 at this shit stain of a meal. They told me, \"Oh. Its being worked on right now\". So, I said I hung up in anger. I had work and needed my food. So, about 35 minutes later I got my food.   I called many times to try get a refund for the cold foos but never happened. Never eat here. Management is pure shit. It was so shit, I had to make Yelp to review it. Congrats!"}
{"text":"My fellow coworkers and I order delivery from David's often.  Their food is decent and their prices are reasonable and we're just too busy to leave the office and get lunch.  Normally they are very prompt with delivery, however, there have been a couple of times when we had to wait A VERY LONG TIME for our food.  Today it took almost 2 hours.  Needless to say, the food was cold, limp, soggy and disgusting.  The reason I'm writing this review is because both times I've called them to complain and they just simply don't care.  There has been no offer to replace the food, or discount the food or anything.  A very trite and insincere apology was all that was offered.  I will NEVER order from this restaurant again and I will NEVER recommend them to the hundreds of people in the corporate complex in which I work that are always looking for a restaurant to deliver them lunch."}
{"text":"If you do not dine here with high expectations you will not be disappointed.  We ordered the least expensive hamburgers ($7.99) and they was decent.  If you have been to the Habit Grill or in-n-out burgers you will notice a similarity. The space is tiny & they might be crowded at times.  We went around 1:00 on Saturday after attending the Scottsdale Arts Fair (very good) and the normal lunch crowd was probably at the food truck area of the arts fair or the many other restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  Our timing that day was good but it was getting busier when we left. I could not pickup any wifi so you'll depend on cell coverage.  Due to the small space they probably do not encourage you to linger."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service! Myself, my mother & my daughter went to this restaurant a couple of days ago & we were very disappointed in the service. Although the waitress was nice enough she made several mistakes on our final bill. She verbally gave us the wrong prices for the special & then when our bill came she had charged us for 3 drinks which we did not have. She over priced me on the special but she blamed it on the computer & when she went to change the bill to the correct price she came & it had not taken off the extra money on the special which she specifically said it had. Even though she apologized, she did not try to make it right at all.  We told her to make sure to NOT charge card for the first wrong price & she assured us she did not. Today my mother checked & she DID charge us both times! The food sucked! The service was worse and now she will not let us talk to the manager! She said she can not reverse the charges & all she can do is ask the manager on MONDAY to send us a check! Bull s*#@ !! I was a server for years & I know it's possible & I also know that she had to charge mom's card twice at the end of her shift! This is just unacceptable. Don't waste your time or money at this dive!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate breakfast here using an Entertainment coupon. We both had omelettes, which were fine. Our server was prompt, friendly, and cheerful. The ice tea, coffee and toast were all good. And the booths are comfortable and clean.  Unfortunately, my breakfast potatoes were without question were the worst I have ever had or even laid eyes on. They literally looked like they could walk off the plate. I tried them and could not even swallow. Cold and slimy. My girlfriend got hash browns. Imagine a cold mouthful of canola oil.   A couple of small menu and order discrepancies also happened. The decor is unappealing and the pre-packaged muffins on display at the bar didn't leave a good first impression. The bathrooms were what you'd expect at a bar. Overall, we still had a good time, but I absolutely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review.   The food was good (the burgers were really good) and the place should be full of patrons because of it.   Oddly, we were the only people in the restaurant. Besides the two servers who could have cared less that we were there, that is.  The restaurant itself, in my humble opinion, should be painted, totally aired out and present itself as a sports bar or burger joint. The combination of mexican food and burgers is odd, and if you ask me (which you didn't but I'm telling you anyway) it just doesn't sell. Do one or the other and do it well.    The inside smelled heavily of grease, and we actually smelled like it after we left the place. Ick!  The 60's motif just doesn't cut it, and neither does the obnoxious yellow paint.   However, the food is the draw, and the burgers were really good (and inexpensive, considering). I'd go back for a hangover burger, but have to keep my sunglasses on and febreeze in my purse..."}
{"text":"As I was eating this David's burger with one hand, my other hand was battling one or two of those pesky gnats floating right above the table. Those things are tough to kill unless you clap your hands on them or make a good effort to trap them against the wall of the booth. I finally nailed one of those guys near the end of the meal.  As for the burger, it wasn't as good as my previous visit over a year agao - nothing ever is it seems. They use frozen fries and onion rings, but claim to use fresh meat. I don't understand why you wouldn't make more of an effort with your fries/rings if you focus on burgers. David's Burger is set up like an in and Out burger right down to the thousand Island, so for about 3 bucks less you can get fresh fries and the same burger over there basically.  For some reason, the Patty Melt that my date had looked good, but overall this place is a dinasaur in the burger wars in the area. And hold the Gnats next time please."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I had the no 87 which wasn't shy with the onions or mushrooms... Which I love. The apple pie a la mode was also delicious.  The bathrooms were weird and the restaurant itself was sort of stuffy but as far as greasy, classic burgers go.. Top notch."}
{"text":"I've eaten at David's many times and the restaurant is a unique staple in old town. The restaurant has a feel of a 50s diner with great authentic American cuisine. Bonus- you can also order authentic Mexican food. There's something for everyone in this casual atmosphere. The shakes are delicious. This is not a super fancy restaurant but it's not trying to be and that's what makes it so good. I've always had a great meal here!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place !  It's one of my favorite lunch places . The green chili burger is to die for ! Come in here very hungry and you will not be disappointed in their burgers !    So other items are pretty good , but burgers and shakes is where it's at ! But not at same time - too much ! :)   Hope they are here to stay and never go away !"}
{"text":"Very good turkey burger and chili dog. Good prices. Interesting decor. Good service, all staff are very nice, multiple staff always coming by to check on you. Had live music while we there on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Just your basic burger joint set up as a 50s style diner. Prices are reasonable, service was great, food is decent.  I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I just had the most perfectly prepared breakfast of all time.  Steak & Eggs is a breakfast staple, but this place hit a Green Monster home run with a whiffle ball bat.  Steak was marinated to perfection, hash browns were perfectly crispy, not the mushy sludge of many breakfast diners.  Located in the heart of Old Town, David's is the best place to get a start on your turquoise search or recover when you are picking up your car after a hard night of partying. This breakfast makes me never want to eat again because every meal from now on will be a disappointment in comparison."}
{"text":"Went to grab an order to go. I have been going to rehab burger but wanted to give this place a shot. Inside was pretty cool. Had an old time diner feel to it. I ordered the Texas burger but asked the sauce to be on the side. By the time I brought it home I found I did not get the sauce on the side. Seems like a pretty simple request and it's not like they were busy (I was the only one there). Having said that the burger and fries were pretty good. Just a straight up tasty diner style burger the way it should be. I guess the in enthusiastic service and the screwing up of my request of having the sauce on the side is why it's 3 stars instead of five."}
{"text":"The Burgers are very good! They have a classic taste.  Nothing flashy just good ingredients.  Their Mexican food is very good as well.  I have ordered from them 3-4 times on grubhub, they are always fast and the food tastes great!"}
{"text":"I personally love this place. Crazy fast delivery and the Mexican food is beyond good. You get way more than you pay for here. Delivery can be hit or miss but once they get your place down they're really good. Longest I've ever waited is an hour and it's normally 20 minutes."}
{"text":"When I walked in and seen the place empty I should have put 2 and 2 together. Food was ok I guess but I spent the next 5 hours burping up the taste and heartburn.   Def wouldn't hit this place again."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new with the kids.  Hind-site, should've gone to Sugar Bowl.  Our waitress was horrible.  We never got utensils, practically had to get our own refills, never given napkins. Wrong food brought out and she tried to argue that the order was correct.  I don't feel so bad with this review because the other tables around us were having the same issues too."}
{"text":"Horrible...a tourist trap in Old Scottsdale with poor food and even poorer service.  Only recommend to your enemies...ordered eggs with pancakes and hash browns and bacon.  Eggs came cold and powder like, pancakes were not consistent in taste or size, the hash browns are more like thick French fries and the bacon was exceptionally salty.  One of the worse quality meals for $7+, and the slow service and being ignored during the meal - even not being asked for more coffee or anything else.  Any Denny's next time if you are desperate on Xmas with not many places open.  Scottsdale is a wonderful town there are so many other choices - do not waste your $$ here"}
{"text":"Good burgers, good service, and they serve the whole menu all day.  The fresh squeezed OJ was heavenly.  I didn't try any Mexican food, but it definitely looked good."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointing.   I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelette, and the omelette (I asked for it as a scramble instead) came without the mushrooms.  (She also forgot my toast, and I had to remind her.)  I told the waitress , and she came back 3 minutes later with a bowl of disgusting looking mushrooms.  I mean, SERIOUSLY?!!?  I asked her if she could take the whole plate away and get them to re-make the dish how it was supposed to be made, with the mushrooms actually inside the scramble.  Also, the \"potatoes\" were just greasy fries cut up into little squares.  It's incredible that they could get a spinach and mushroom scramble wrong.  There were four of us in total, and she did not offer any of us any re-fills on our drinks.  We had to flag her down and ask her several times.  The waitress was nice enough, but just seemed extremely confused in general.    Unfortunately, we will never come back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Authentic, amazing, addictive street tacos.  They just don't get any better than this without a car and a passport.  Because it's in the epicenter of tourist town, for locals, this might be the best kept secret in Scottsdale.  And David is the real deal - a hard-working, humble, gracious Mexican American who serves up some of the best food off a crazy, ecclectic menu.  Stop by  - I absolutely guarantee you'll be pleased!"}
{"text":"We love David's, especially being able to order on grub hub. When my husband feels like Mexican and I want a patty melt, and we don't want to leave the couch after a long day of work, this place is the winner!  We have ordered from them 10+ times and have never had a less than par experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in recently with my fiance and felt underwhelmed by the service. The food was bland and unevenly proportioned, and everything tasted like it had either come from a can or been microwaved. Our waitress was uninterested in following up with us and it took forever for the food to get out."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for a quick informal lunch at a good price. And the service ws outstanding - very friendly. Maybe that was David :-)  However, it is first and foremost a burger joint that appears to have branched out to mexican food as an after thought. The ambiance, decor, music (and the fact they have an old fashioned  \"fountain\" with stellar milkshakes) all remind me of a 50's style diner. No hint of Mexican there. But nothing wrong with that as the food is good. I'd return if I was downtown but would not drive out of my way for a meal."}
{"text":"I was very hungry the other night, and decided to give Davids Original Hamburgers a try for delivery.  Now, I live in Scottsdale which, last time I checked, was in the United States where English is spoken, but maybe I'm wrong.  The person answering the phone spoke some kind of English, because I only had to ask him to repeat himself twice per question to understand him.  After repeating the name of my street 4 times, and spelling it for him twice, we finally got around to ordering.  I asked three times for a Philly Cheese Steak with fries, only because he didn't seem to understand a word I was saying.  I should have become suspicious when he asked me if I wanted steak on my fries...?????  Anyway, after hanging up, he calls back 5 minutes later and asks me to once again repeat my street name.  35 minutes later, a very nice young man showed up with my food.....and order of chili cheese fries.  I refused the order, as hungry as I was, but the delivery guy gave them to me anyway, no charge.  The only reason I ate about a quarter of them was that I was so hungry, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't feed them to a starving dog.  They were pasty, soggy, and quite probably the worst thing I've ever eaten.  No thanks Dave, but here's a tip.....put someone on the phone that speaks English."}
{"text":"This is a burger joint that also has mexican food...stick to the burgers and you will be fine. The patties are fresh ground and not frozen. Went with a group and 4 of us had burgers one had tacos. Burgers were great the tacos were ok. We had fries and onion rings, both were good. Not the best burger I have ever had, but for 6 bucks i have no complaints."}
{"text":"I love this place and always order from here through Eat24 when I stay in Scottsdale. I can recommend EVERYTHING on the menu. The tuna melt is epic, the hamburgers are delicious and yes, even the Mexican food is awesome. Their fries stay crispy even after they're cold. I can't say enough hood things about everything they do right but I forgot to mention how good their breakfast is, too. I just ordered from there again after writing this review because my review made me hungry for their food. Mmm... blueberry pancakes. You can even get bacon in your pancakes here!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love a great hamburger and David's delivers...literally, I live in Old Town and can get my David's fix directly to my door.  These are right on top of my list of favorite burgers - big, juicy and delicious.  I hope they stay in business for a long, long time.  Burgers this good and this reasonably priced are few and far between."}
{"text":"We must have walked by this place 100 times without ever seeing it, but a quick Yelp search showed us this burger place was was hiding in plain sight.   The place is quaint and the service was friendly. The burger was a burger, nothing special. The taco salad was unique, served with with bacon and ranch dressing. It was surprising but good. I do t think either dish was something we would crave but it's good if you're in the area and don't want to drive or weak elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Asked for apples on side...they still put them in the syrup.  No butter...ordered French toast.  Deliver driver couldn't even give me a $5 back for change.  Last time, I ordered a milk shake with my burger...no straw.    I won't order from them until I'm told they have tightened up a bit.  Considering the lackadaisical effort, the $1 delivery charge is a crock of shit.   Food is usually alright from what I remember.  Was alright this time.  I'm still all set with them."}
{"text":"Normally when you get a burger delivered, it can be soggy and unappetizing. Not the case here. I received my burger as if it were just served to at the table. Needless to say, I will be ordering from David's Hamburgers again."}
{"text":"I would give a higher rating but since I only experienced breakfast, I'm reserving those marks for an update. It is cozy and welcoming so you can't go wrong, especially stepping in to find a Patsy Cline-esque wooing you to take a seat. Blueberry pancakes were my fave, with a side of hash browns covered in oozing homemade hot sauce. You can't go wrong with that sauce. And if you sit on the patio, particularly on a random rainy day in Scottsdale, you feel like you've been transported to a time of simplicity!"}
{"text":"To be fair all I ordered was oatmeal, but my dad swears they have the best pancakes around! Perfect hidden breakfast spot to try."}
{"text":"Took an out of town to spend a few days OldTown Scottsdale.  We checked into the Hotel a little later than expected and walking around exploring.  I had a coupon book that had a bogo for them and were happily surprised to see them open.  The burgers were GOOD! The young lady waiting on us was very friendly.  It is a cute little, diner style place, reminisce of the 50's.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"To my knowledge, finding a burger place that delivers is rare. It has to be exceedingly rare to find one that cooks some great food. Luckily for me, i found that place. I recommend the Texas Burger with onion rings. It's awesome!  Here is a pdf I created for their menu: http://bit.ly/xjqgj4"}
{"text":"Was going to Sugar Bowl (around the corner) for banana splits but wanted some real food also.  The food menu at Sugar Bowl is to simple/strange for me.  We decided to try this place since there is a B1G1 coupon in the entertainment book.  It seems like a family run business and the decor is a kinda cute fifties soda bar theme.  The bonus is that they offer breakfast all day (apple waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, ect.), Mexican (my husband loved his carnitas tacos. they were huge and looked tasty) as well as Hamburgers.  I had a veggie burger with cheese fries.  A little bit of everything for anyone.  :)"}
{"text":"Bland burgers. Fast food is better than this place. Kinda akward little kid running in and out of the kitchen? Fries were soggy, buns dry not fresh at all, Stay away from chili cheese fries, chili tasted horrible like a cheap Canned brand. Didn't seem to be a manager on duty place was empty. Let server know our group didn't care for our food. Server didn't offer to fix anything with our food. Really disappointed don't understand how this place is even able to operate and stay open. Go to any of the other 4 or more burger places in the area."}
{"text":"On Saturday mornings, we like to hit up the Old Town Farmer's Market and then get some breakfast.  Our usual joint was booked and we thought we would try something new.  From the outside, David's Hamburgers looked like a good place to try.  Stepping inside, was quite different, but not in a bad way.  They feature an authentic Yodeler from Branson, MO, and have her posters everywhere, along with a 50's style theme.  It works for what it is, a hamburger joint, right? Our problems started from the moment we walked in the door. The restaurant had one other patron, sitting at the counter, and there were 7 of us, four adults and three kids. My mom, daughter and I arrived first, ordered our coffee and OJ and waited for the others.  They strolled in about 10 minutes later.  We didn't see a server for at least 20 minutes.  At this point, there are more guests walking through the door, looking to fill their hungry bellies.  Our server finally notices we have added to our group and we give her our entire order, as we didn't know when she might come back.  I could see she did not have a lot of help, so I gave her a break, understanding her being flustered.  We found entertainment with the Yodeler, and the kids weren't losing it...yet. An hour and fifteen minutes after we showed up, the food arrived in two orders, 10 minutes apart. It was cold and not very good.  My pancakes had turned rubbery and the sausage was overcooked to almost burnt, but my eggs were undercooked.  It was the same around the table.  Complaining, once I grabbed a manager, did no good.  He took my mom's plate of biscuits and  gravy back and microwaved it, as if it was normal. He never offered to take the food I clearly couldn't eat off of my bill. If this is the type of service they are offering, I'm not buying...ever again. I was surprised to see such disregard for customer service and in Old Town Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"Terrible, greasy, not a great menu. Basic diner food but not done well. nice waitresses though. Cheap prices."}
{"text":"Ate at this place for lunch a few days ago.  I had a burger and was impressed by the quality of meat and how fresh it tasted.  The decor isn't the greatest, but the value is good, and the portions are ample.  The service was also decent - overall, I enjoyed it and will return in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible! \"Seat yourself\" they said. Right- good luck getting a waiter/waitress. They serve complimentary chips and salsa ... only if you ask for it. Salsa was good! Placed an order, I kid you not, for a grilled cheese and fries. 40 minutes later and still no lunch so went on my way.  Restaurant due to close at 4:00 on Sunday - at 2:30 the staff posted a hand written sign on the door saying \"Kitchen now closed.\" Amazing!"}
{"text":"In the last month this place has taken a massive nose dive. The food is under cooked and I can get better frozen food at this point. This is over the last 4 orders within a month."}
{"text":"A little joint who had a country singer from Branson, Mo. singing away in there at the time.  The burgers are pretty darn tasty and not too pricey but they need to check themselves with the service.  One time I went in there for some drinks cause I was melting from the heat and it took some time to not only get the drinks but to get them to come back and take the money so I could go!  Another time hubs went in there to get some to go burgers for us and again - service was totally discombobulated about taking, getting, giving the orders and change!   Fix those elements and ya might just get more stars."}
{"text":"This one is hard because they are the only place that delivers Mexican food and my husband can order a burger. The refried beans and rice are both good and the steak is average at best. The problem is eery other time we order there they mess the order up somehow. Either they make the wrong burger, switch meats, forget the chips/salsa or give us cold food. It's typically a draw if we will get the order correct or not every time. It has not caused us to stop going there, but does make us annoyed with their accuracy."}
{"text":"Thinking a burger sounded just right, I stopped in here for dinner last night and ordered the Route 87 with lemonade.  The lemonade was fresh, but a bit tart for my preference.  The fries were great, and the burger was tasty.  HOWEVER, halfway through my meal, my boyfriend spotted a giant cockroach on the wall a foot away from me.  The waitress removed it, apologized, and comp'd my meal but heebie jeebies will keep me away from this place FOREVER."}
{"text":"The burgers here are so damn good! I love the cheeseburger with jalapenos and the bacon guacamole burger and their onion rings. I also love that this place is open so late! Score. mmmm. Delicious."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  It didn't blow my socks off or anything, but it doesn't have to.  It's a burger joint and the burgers are pretty damn good.  For $1, you can add chilli, so fuck yeah, I got myself a chilli burger.  I haven't done that in years and I regret NOTHING.  They have good fries and I had some onion rings to share between me and my girlfriend, too.  They also serve Mexican food which I'm curious to try, but in a much more morbid form of curiosity, the same level of curiosity that allows young men to watch horrible, horrible videos online.  Chances are, if you serve burgers and burritos, either only one will be good or both will be terrible.  I don't think they can do both; historically, I've never experienced this, but I'm not gonna ding 'em on something I've never tried.  Overall, they're attentive, they have damn reasonable prices and their burgers and fuckin' YUM."}
{"text":"The food is great and the wait time is even better. I've ordered from here about 4 times and if the boy deliveries he is on time and ask if I need anything else and if everything is correct.  If the girl deliveries she is an hr late, has to stop at the front office to get a map of the apartment complex and forgets half the food in the car. The amount of food is more than enough to get you full and is extremely cheap. Every time I had a problem they were sympathetic and accountable."}
{"text":"They have a burger with freakin onion rings and bacon on it! They also have milk shakes and they deliver around the old town area. Do not pay attention to some the rejects on this page. Order some food and enjoy."}
{"text":"When i looked at this place I wanted to run the other way. There was absolutely no magnetism there. I was with a group of family members and was out voted so in we go. We were greeted by a friendly staff that was eager to assist us (the place was dead). The waitress came by to take our order and I was going to go the Mexican food route. I figured heck i traveled over 900 miles I might as well as I am not going to get any closer to the border. I asked if they had horchata, and she had to go check. I took this as a bad sign either waitress on training wheels or has no clue what it is. Well they don't have any. So i decide to go with the enchiladas. Never again.... sorry guys the others in the party had burgers. They said they were good.  Would I go back?  i think I will go check out more of the local establishments before returning."}
{"text":"This is my go to on grub hub. They deliver in my area and the food is in point. The shakes are great, burgers are awesome, and they have killer onion rings."}
{"text":"Think Johnny Rockets but with the ability to also order a burrito or waffle with your burger.  Eclectic menu for the eclectic part of Scottsdale.  Also, good value."}
{"text":"David's is a relaxed 50's style diner in Old Town Scottsdale. Their cheeseburgers are incredible. I also recommend their strawberry shake and onion rings!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the price was awesome and it was delivered hot in 30 minutes! Their chili was great and their fries were tasty.  The chicken tenders were overcooked and tough, but for reasonable delivery that isn't the usual pizza or chinese I would recommend them to everyone.  They have a wonderfully diverse menu.  I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"3.5  While I'm almost a fan, I should have paid better attention to the name of the restaurant when ordering.  Had it been Julio's Mexican Food & Other Stuff, my order would have been a wise choice.  But instead I ordered a carne asada quesadilla made by David who specializes in hamburgers.  In all fairness to David, it was not bad.  I'm not a big quesadilla person, but the Mexican plates seemed to large for me to consume and expect to walk around the arts festival afterward.  And if I can't take it home, I'm inclined to stuff it down.  I didn't care for the meat in the quesadilla (not the seasoning, but the actual flavor of the meat itself was odd), but it was perfectly buttery and toasty and full of cheese and veggies as well.  My husband's hamburger, however, looked great and I was full of envy as I watched him finish it in record time.  That envy quickly turned to resentment as he sampled my quesadilla and remarked \"yep, mine's better.\"  He would pay for his insensitivity later that afternoon.  I like that they will add flavorings to your soft drink, but my Cherry Coke needed more cherry flavoring and the addition of a cherry would be nice.  I do love that this restaurant has not be redesigned to fit into the trend of turning \"Old Town\" into North Scottsdale, from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booths on the other.  I just think I'll still with burgers and shakes.  Well, who am I kidding?  I'll order David's Mexican food again.  I can't turn down anything in a tortilla."}
{"text":"I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here.   Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll.   I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal.   Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa.   Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup.   The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence.   If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?"}
{"text":"Greasy, subpar burgers and Philly. Disappointed and got a stomachache after eating. Seemed all slopped together and thrown in a bag. I'd rather get In n Out burger any day. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've only ordered for delivery from David's, but good god, are they fast! PLUS you can put in orders through Yelp. How kickass is that?!  I order the carne asada burrito every time.. for a reason. It's a bomb burrito! You don't get those cheese and pico pockets exploding on you every few bites. I also get the chili.. lemme tell ya, I ain't no chili expert, but David's does it right. It surely is delectable. And the prices are low! Can't beat it. Ha, beat it.  I would highly recommend this joint to ANYONE in Old Town or surrounding areas. You won't be let down."}
{"text":"Breakfast. Waited several minutes for coffee. Said they were out of mugs.  Then we got up and got our own refills from their pot; nobody came around to refill. Ordered, then waited 45 minutes for food. Order was wrong - food was cold. Ordered fruit that was not delivered, no sauce on benedict lorraine; toast was cold, eggs dry, We had to ask for silverware and napkins. Other tables were getting slow service also.  No ice tea. They took 20 % off for slow service. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Great burgers. They are some of the best in town. However the service is not good. They do try but early have no clue. It may be best to go on off hours."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries! My chocolate shake was also quite yummy! Love how it looks like a cute little 50's diner. Haven't tried the Mexican food yet, but, I will next time. Definitely the place to go if you have a craving for a food burger,"}
{"text":"Super satisfied. Breakfast all day, so hubby is happy. Chicken club for me, and it was delish. Clean, great service. Check it out soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered through grubhub, it came 35 min late and cold, cheese was gross because it was sitting for so long. I called to get a reorder and they said there was only 1 delivery person and over 6 orders already out so we had to get a refund from grubhub. Whoever the manager is needs to hire more delivery people or take your business off of grubhub."}
{"text":"Very disappointing lunch experience.   I had been here previously and usually got in right away with decent food.  This time we came in and it was busy which is understandable for a Friday around lunch time. However,  it appeared they only had 2 people working and nobody greeted us. We ended up seating ourselves along with 4 other groups of people that came in after us. The other 4 groups ended up giving up and left. We stuck it out and finally were greeted and able to place our order after waiting 15 minutes. Based on this experience David's may just have lost our repeat business."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for the very first time and it was the worst experience EVER! Had our food delivered, and our order was messed up (last I checked, that was THEIR bad), I was told that if I wanted it corrected, I would have to bring it back, they wouldn't re-deliver!!! Never, EVER going here again. Oh, best part? I asked if I could talk to a manager and was told to call back tomorrow. Superbowl Sunday at a delivery burger place and no manager?!? Wow!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at David's a couple of times and can't say I've been disappointed with the food and the French toast is amazing!"}
{"text":"Walking inside the place I noticed how the overall atmosphere of it is very 50's 60's. the decour inside Complimenting the atmosphere!   We were not greeted by anyone and it took them about 4/5 mins to meet our server. When she did come over she was quite nice and brought out drinks out right away.  My boyfriend ordered biscuits and gravy and I got a tuna salad Sandwich. The biscuits and gravy were delicious! Tasted very homemade and full of flavor! The sandwich was good as well very large portion, Definitely moneys worth.    I plan on going back and trying their burgers!    The service wasn't all that great but not terrible either... The food was tasty and fairly priced!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem ... Great friendly service and clean...  We had the green chile burger (they don't scrimp on the green chile) you can tell they use fresh ingredients .. Onion rings were delicious ....Will definitely recommend and bring our next house guests here"}
{"text":"Good spot of a quick bite, basic, old school greasy menu but sometimes that's just what you need."}
{"text":"Great location in Old Town Scottsdale.  The food was ok. Price is good. I do want to give a shout out to the sweet server named Sam. She was such a hard worker  and her customer service was bar none."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. I have never eaten on site always order delivery. While the food is one of our favorites I have some serious complaints about the customer service.  It is always hard to get a hold of someone to place an order and more often then not we are left 'on hold\" which means placed on the counter to hear everyone's conversations.. 10 min later we are usually helped and it takes quite a while for the person to take the order down. One of my biggest problem with Davids is we order for the office 4 different  meal orders, all being delivered to the same location, and each order is slapped with a delivery charge. ( most other lunch spots we order from divide that fee up or only charge once.) Its a bummer when choosing lunch that we have started to look elsewhere so we don't have to deal with their customer service."}
{"text":"Conviniently located in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale, frienly service, good David's Burger and chicken salad. The price was right too."}
{"text":"I found this place while wandering around Scottsdale and I needed a quick lunch. It's a quaint little diner. Service was very friendly and quick. She recommended the flautas as they were her favorite. Glad I took her advice!  Soft shredded chicken in the middle and perfectly crunchy taco on the outside.  Nice serving of guacamole to go with it too.  Loved it as a good in and out place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Terrible slow service! Waited over 40 minutes for a burger! Crazy. We will not be back.Food was luke warm too"}
{"text":"Ordered the chili size.. Open face and chili hamburger. Great flavor and  perfectly cooked. Great service great price!"}
{"text":"Coffee was cold, hamburger fell apart, had the taste of grease in my mouth the rest of the day. Whats it famous for? Upset stomachs!! My first clue it was going to be bad should have been that, I walked in there at lunch time on a Tuesday and it was empty. Ding, ding ding."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We found this little gem with the help of Yelp and we are so glad we did. The staff was attentive and great. We definitely will be back. My hsband had an enormous steak chimi and I had the Texas BBQ Burger and it was all great. Check this place out. You wont be dissapointed.  Great value for the money."}
{"text":"It is hard to believe that we ate at the same place as some of these other reviewers.  We stopped in to get breakfast before going to a Giants game and had one of the worst dining experiences that we have ever had.   My daughter ordered a cheese omelet--what she got was a folded pile of greenish looking eggs with a bit of cheese melted on top.  My son ordered plain pancakes with nothing on them (he is very picky about his food) and got four pancakes smothered with powdered sugar.  The waitress (who was wearing a sloppy grease stained shirt) seemed oblivious to his distress.  I ordered huevos rancheros and got a plate with a slice of ham, two eggs, and some type of apple concoction all smothered with beans with a cup of covered canned salsa on the side.  Yuck  The four gentlemen at the table next to us were so exasperated by the poor service and their mixed up orders that after trying to communicate with the staff ended up just leaving (they paid of course).  Maybe breakfast isn't their strong suit, but if that is the case, they shouldn't serve it."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them before,  and I have never been disappointed. And this time they knocked it out of the park. Such a good breakfast, egg whites with tomato, spinach, cheese, and a side of toast and potatoes with an orange juice.  They deliver Breakfast poeple. Yumm."}
{"text":"I have tried everything on the menu 100 times I love the burgers I like breakfast but getting my order right half the time is absolutely impossible. They just can't compete with Uber eats or post Mates and it's painfully obvious. If you get it every now & then it's great but if you would like to order as easy and as well as apps this place is a BRUTAL!!! They make it hard to give them my business and I spent a lot on food. Please clean it up Davids"}
{"text":"Found this joint using the Yelp App.  It was 11 am on a Thu and was getting hungry.  I lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the joint.  The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:  Texas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=8vow_cM6bCgIO0HWGbCizw Hot Dog (Nathan's Hot Dog, Onions, Relish, Mustard) - $4.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=aJkenAKKYIXTrSK1Of9b0Q  The food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=82Ua27nge5lTTx9N7g2rAg I went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.  Next up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=uPb_Py9o7hP_7UCBsIqc-Q Cooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.  Fries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I don't know what the one or three star reviewers are talking about, but since we'll go back, maybe we'll find out.   My wife and I had a coupon and went there because we were starving and close.  The place smells, not like grease, but like good hamburgers.  It is bright, clean, and nicely decorated, but definitely casual, as expected. And the burgers are good.  I had David's burger and my wife had the deluxe.  The grilled burgers are very high quality and taste wonderful.  The ingredients are fresh.  The burgers and sandwiches come with a side of fries or coleslaw.  I had fries, and my wife tried the 'slaw.  She commented that the 'slaw tasted like they'd just made it with fresh ingredients.  It was fresh.  It didn't have as much character as some I have had before, but it was really good.  The fries tasted about as good as fries can get, my wife agreed.  They are not skinny fries like at McDonald's or In-n-Out, but regular-sized.  I thought they might be from fresh potatoes, so I asked.  Nope, they're frozen.  They're good.  While we dined, the waiter brought a tray with a huge, and wonderful looking taco salad to another table.  Maybe I'll try that next time.  And there will be a next time.  The only thing I can't comment on positively was that there were no kids in there, but some were leaving as we arrived, and they left Harry Potter on the TVs the whole time, but never played background music.  We arrived there on a February Saturday night about 6:15.  I am still puzzling over why they weren't crowded.  A very good value for fresh-made food."}
{"text":"Service was good, the food not so much.  It was served room temp and was very bland, shortly after leaving we both had upset stomachs..."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and half for delivery. Called to ask about it and to speak with a manager and they didn't have one on, food got here cold and shakes melted, the delivery driver dumped the food into our hands and booked it back to his car. Over all not impressed and highly disappointed. Still waiting to hear back from a manager."}
{"text":"I think I must have been there the same day as Ron H!!  As Ron mentioned, this is Spring Training time in Scottsdale.  There actually aren't that many breakfast places around in Old Town, and David's should be taking full advantage, but we won't be back next year... sorry David.   I'm just going to list the problems we encountered: 1. Seated and ignored. 2. A table of four came in after us, and they were eating within minutes of our order finally being taken.  They were seated right next to us, so it wasn't as if we couldn't be seen!  The young lady who finally took our order must have been on her first day, but seriously... hello, anybody in there? 3.  The OJ is fresh squeezed and very tasty, but they can only make one glass at a time.  It is not chilled.  The OJ was gone by the time breakfast arrived. 4.  My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich.  I am not a traditional breakfast person, so I ordered a turkey sandwich. 5.  We sat there and sat there and sat there.  The narrator's voice of Hells Kitchen was playing in my head, \"and the guests were getting impatient.\" 6.  Finally, a waitress (not ours), inquired if we had been served yet (since the previously mentioned table of four were leaving after consuming their meals).  She hustled  back to the kitchen and came out with our order, apologizing for the delay.  I figured it was our dingbat server's fault, and I did not hold it against the establishment as a whole, except for the fact no one was following said dingbat around to make sure she was doing her job. 7.  Our food arrived.  My turkey sandwich was tasty, but I was noticing the \"3 slices of bacon\" promoted on the menu were absent.  I thought about complaining, but then my husband, after taking his first bite of his breakfast sandwich, said \"taste this bacon, it is the saltiest bacon I have ever eaten.\"  OMG, what an understatement!  It tasted like they rolled the bacon in salt, fried it, and then rolled it in more salt and slapped it on an egg sandwich. 8.  Hubby complained... I decided not to complain about my asbsent bacon.  They offered to make him another (he requested sausage instead) but the whole process took so long, my husband finally cancelled the order.  We were in there well over an hour by this time. 9. The older guy (maybe this is David or the manager) was very apologetic, offered to take it off the bill and wrap up the new sandwich to go, but hubby decided he was probably better off not taking a chance."}
{"text":"Super friendly service, I had the Super Salad with grilled chicken which was chopped & grilled with a slight crispy edging...perfectly seasoned. Fresh, crisp salad. The fam enjoyed a chili cheeseburger, grilled ham & cheese & a cheeseburger, fries & onion rings! Perfect, easy, burgers as they should be."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner yesterday from this place. The onion rings were crispy but almost inedible due to saltiness. The burger patty melt sandwich was everything you would not want in a burger patty melt sandwich. The sourdough bread was dripping greasy, the beef patty was dry and tasteless and for a melt sandwich there was hardly any cheese in it. I gave 2 stars to this place, because I enjoyed the all meat chili. It was hearty and spicy however cold. Oh yes. All the food was cold."}
{"text":"We were in the area on Christmas Day and most places were closed for lunch. I called and this was one of the few places that was open, they deliver and was so accommodating. The driver even stopped at a grocery store to grab us a six-pack since they don't serve alcohol. The sandwiches were huge and good!"}
{"text":"The star rating is not what I want to give David's because I typically enjoy their food. However the only way I have found to eat David's is in the physical restaurant itself.   I've ordered delivery from here a few times and it's never good. I just got cheese fries and a burger and I can't even eat the burger because the bun is so soggy and same kent the fries. Both are soggy, cold and not edible.   I felt bad for the delivery guy so I still threw him a bad tip even though it took over a hour to get here when they told us 35 minutes.  Pretty bummed about David's right now"}
{"text":"A perfectly cooked hamburger that was juicy and great tasting! I highly suggest the half fries half onion rings at your side order. Whenever I'm in Scottsdale I will always stop by Dave's for a burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes! Quiet little place with good service. Used a restaurant.com certificate so it was very economical."}
{"text":"We have been to David's many times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and have never been disappointed. The interior is not fancy, but the food and service is always excellent - and the prices are very reasonable. We have never tried their delivery service, but dine-in is always solid."}
{"text":"They deserve a ZERO STAR rating! This was the absolute worst service and food preparation experience I've ever had. The place was half empty at 1pm when we went in, but it still took over 30 minutes to get our drinks.  Food came out a full 75 minutes after ordering, and 20 minutes after 3 of our 5 member party had left in disgust. Wait staff got more and more inattentive the longer it took for the food (\"Oh, we're just waiting for the fries\". LAME EXCUSE AFTER SITTING FOR ALMOST AM HOUR!). I asked to see the manager, but nobody identified as that person ever came by our table. (I still wonder if there even WAS a manager on duty). And even after all that they were stingy about comping us any of the food or drinks. Don't waste your time or money on this place, there's plenty of other eateries in Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yum!  This is a cute place with good food. We had a great time and loved the atmosphere. The service was also very good."}
{"text":"Hamburgers here might have been the talk of the town early last century, but in today's fast food market David's burgers are  neither fast or competitive. Lunch hour and it took almost 20 minutes for a hamburger patty that couldn't have been on the grill for a minute. The David's Deluxe isn't by any way except weight maybe. Could have been the 1 1/2\" - to 2\" of chopped lettuce. Sure wasn't the single piece of bacon , pickles or patty.  Maybe I should have tried the Mexican, but you can be sure I want be making a drive from East Mesa to Scottsdale for just that.,"}
{"text":"This review is a little dated seeing as I was there last year but, here you go.    This place is pretty good.  I had a vanilla Coke and a Texas burger. Zing and zang!  My only complaint was that there was only maybe 8 onion rings that came as a side. A few more would have made me happy.  The ambiance is cool, although i was there in the late afternoon so it was pretty quiet.  i bet is sounds like an old school diner when it is filled up.  I might drop by again soon."}
{"text":"Great food, awful service. Every time I come here I feel like I'm speaking Martian to the waitress.  Recent example: we finally stumble thru getting her to comprehend our order, only took 4 minutes to order a plain burger and a davids burger and two drinks, she comes back about 5 minutes later with one drink and then spends the next 7 minutes bussing tables.  Then we tried to explain to her what Mr Pib is, despite it being right on the menu. Ordering anything was like pulling teeth.  Also had to send our check back twice... Don't come here if you don't have patience."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their burgers are so juicy and delicious and the buns aren't your cheap run of the mill buns.  I think maybe they make them in house.  I really like the Texas style burger with the onion rings and barbecue sauce, not to mention the crispy bacon!  My fiancé liked it too and I even got him to eat some of the fries which he rarely does.  I haven't tried their Mexican food, but they also have breakfast which my coworker told me is fantastic.  They have delicious food at normal prices (unlike most of Scottsdale).  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is just ok not terrible not great  Went on a Monday night and it was dead. Meal was cheep. There Are way better Burgers at other spots in Old Town"}
{"text":"I've been selfishly reluctant to give a review on this hidden gem in OldTown, as to not alert the masses. Quite possibly one of the best burgers I've ever ordered and certainly one best you'll find here.  I'm always torn between the Green Chili Burger and the Patty Melt, they're both so damn good! If you're feeling squirrelly, double down on either with a 2nd patty.  They serve breakfast all day, too, which is pretty bad ass and more places should do this.  It should also be noted that they make one amazing Peanut Butter Malt / Shake."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best burger places! WE order delivery at work at least once a week. The food is delicious. I strongly recommend the BBQ burger that they make it is amazing. French fries are fried to perfection."}
{"text":"Walked past this place while in Scottsdale, noticed tables outside were littered with garbage and people's left over food. An hour later, returned to try out luck at this place, noticed the tables outside still were not cleaned up. My girlfriend sat down at a booth that wasn't secured and hanged over the edge. She almost fell flat on the ground. It was just after that, she pointed out the giant cockroach that was making its rounds from the to table. We just got up and left without ordering. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Runny salsa, weird \"ketchupy\" ceviche, and bland shredded pork tacos. I won't be back for a second time."}
{"text":"Dont go in the night time if you got the short blonde  serving you because she obviously has a party she has to go and made a rude comment saying the cooks in the back don't know English so we can't order our food??? And then She said carryout only but it was only 11pm. It was excuse after excuse for not wanting to serve us, I went in the morning and the  server in the AM  is awesome and the food is great.  I just wanted to show some friends some good food and it was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Texas Burger was out of this world. Cheesy fries were good but could you do a little help looking good. Still give it a five for ambience."}
{"text":"Now, I'll tell you I was a little skeptical.  A place that serves Mexican food and diner food.  Come on, now.  But, I had a 2 4 1 entree coupon via my new entertainment book, so a colleague and I decided to give Davids a try.  And what a cute little 50s style diner it is!  :)  We called in our order and walk over.  When we get there, we let the guy (maybe it's David himself) know that we phoned in our order.  And a minute later he brings out our Davids burger.    Tasty burger.  Handmade burger I believe.  It was falling apart on us.  All in all, fast and friendly service.  Decent eats.  We'll be back !  :)"}
{"text":"This is a great little diner right in old town Scottsdale... we have been coming here for YEARS, and it's known by all us Locals ... Great burgers, if you want a shake with your burger, well they have the BEST shakes, hand made... recommend the peanut butter and chocolate. They also have flavored Coke (vanilla, chocolate or strawberry)  they have great Breakfast items and Mexican too. We love this place !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in the process of moving and I've been eating out & ordering in a lot. I decided to give this place a try and I'm so happy that I did. The prices are great and the food is filling. I was shocked when the delivery driver showed up only 20 minutes after I placed my order, thank you! I rarely eat meat and the burger was yummy! The apple pie is perfect."}
{"text":"I hope David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food burgers are better than their Mexican food.  David's has a '50's theme that for some reason always raises the caution flag. Yet it was clean and very empty, however I arrived right in the dead zone between lunch and dinner.   After a quick look at the menu I ordered the chicken enchiladas. The server then asked a strange question, \"Would you like the free chips and salsa that come with the meal?\"  \"Well yes a would thank you.\", I replied. My free chips soon arrived as did my salsa. The salsa was freshly made but about as bland as one can make salsa, not a good sign. After a short wait my enchiladas arrived. I must say they looked quite good. Yet after the first bite it all went down hill. Bland sauce, bland chicken, dry chicken did nothing to improve on the salsa. The refried beans that came with the enchiladas were too bad, not great, but good. The in house made guac was excellent. Service was average. My un-enjoyable didn't get finished which should tell you something.   Enchiladas, soft drink and free chips $13 with tax.  Will I be back? Maybe, the reviews for the burgers are quite good. The in house made guac almost got it 3 stars. Just say a big NO for the Mexican."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. Maybe I was really hungry, maybe I didn't expect much but what I got was a simply made burger with cheese, tomato, lettuce and spread. You can taste the quality and freshness I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Dont Waste your time!!  I wish I could tell you that the food was either good or bad...unfortunately, we did not even get to taste our food, as they were somehow unable to successfully deliver it. When we called back 90 minutes after our initial order, the food had not even been made yet, as they were having \"problems with their driver\". Again, don't waste your time...they certainly wasted ours! If you aren't able to competently deliver food, then perhaps you should consider removing delivery as an option. Honestly, this is a first...and will be the last for this place!"}
{"text":"Beautiful bountiful burger!  This mildly 1950s-themed diner is the one inexpensive eatery in Old Town, so I walked in with low expectations but left delighted (and very full). Trying the Texas Burger appears to be almost mandatory among Yelpers, and a very fine burger it is. The bun is toasted, the bacon is crisp, the onion ring is onion-y, the burger is juicy, the BBQ sauce has tang, and the cheese is... kinda there. The fries are fries. I ate them.  The service is service. It gets you fed.  On the whole, it's not quite on a par with a really top-notch Smashburger, but the relief of getting a nice, simple, affordable dinner in that section of Scottsdale lends savor to the meal."}
{"text":"If I were rating on food alone, I would rate David's 4 stars...but I'm not.  I have ordered delivery from David's 4 times, and EVERY SINGLE TIME they've gotten something wrong!  My boyfriend and I always order ranch with our French fries, and the second time we ordered, they left out the ranch.  So, the next time we ordered, I specifically mentioned the ranch and the fact that they'd forgotten it before, and I asked them to please remember it this time.  Was it in the bag??  No!  Another time, I ordered a breakfast burrito and specifically asked for sour cream and salsa and told them to be sure not to forget it...and they forgot it!!  I call and complain, and the person I talk to sounds like he's 20 years old and couldn't care less that I'm complaining.  I did get a credit once, but no other time has it been mentioned.    It's a shame that the delivery service sucks so bad because the food is actually very good.  Their burgers are great, and their milkshakes are to die for.  But, next time I order delivery, I'm going to tell them that, if they mess anything up, I am never ordering from them again.  Four times in a row screwing it up is just ridiculous.  This is delivery food, not rocket science."}
{"text":"Went to try David's for the first time - we ordered breakfast.   Took 20 minutes to have our omelette and waffle combos delivered, and they brought the wrong food. Had to explain the menu items to our server, who was very nice.   Food was sub-par, eggs over cooked and house potatoes were clearly repurposed French fries.   Don't go here."}
{"text":"Not good. I was excited to go there for breakfast. I went on Saturday morning thinking it would be packed, it wasn't busy at all, the service was horrible, I told them I don't eat pork, the omelette had Canadian bacon, it wasn't supposed to have any meat at all. She took it back and said that they would make another and inside that one had bacon. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast, French toast was horrible inside of toast was like slime, hash browns greasy and coffee tasted like dirt...the head Florentine my boyfriend got was ok but still greasy. After making the waiter aware he gave us a $4 discount!!! Really I would be apologizing and comping. Don't waste your time with the food and service they are not long in the restaurant business!"}
{"text":"The food was OK just but the great burgers we were craving. We ordered David's burger and a Patty Melt and the fries deserved 5 stars but the David's Burger was overcooked, the lettuce was soggy, and way to many onions. The patty melt was more bread than patty, but the grilled onions were tasty.   When we walked in we seated ourself but the table was dirty. The food took about 20 minutes to get do be prepared if your in a hurry. Very nice old town feel but the food didn't seem to live up to the reviews."}
{"text":"We went to David's for breakfast on a Sunday Morning, we ordered breakfast and lunch items. I would have to say it was the best food we have eaten in the Phoenix area. Our server was excellent. Don't miss this place!!!! Best breakfast and Lunch."}
{"text":"Th avocado burger gave me food poisoning. It looks like other people have had issues with the meat being expired before. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"After our Farm Session and Old Town Farmer's Market tour, we walked around Old Town for a bit.  By now my daughter was hungry and everyone else in our party said, they could have a \"snack\".  We had coupons that Kevin N. had picked up so we were good to give David's a shot.  I was kinda torn between nachos and a Texas Burger.  I waffled but when it came time to order I went with the burger.  My daughter had a hot dog.  The Texas Burger is like the Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheese Burger which is one of my favorite fast food burgers.  Except this was a real pattie that looked like it had been shaped by human hands.....not shaped by a round or square cookie cutter.  And it tasted like a real burger should.  The bacon was crispy, cheese was melty, and the onion rings were crisp.  This was a good burger in my book.  The fries were crispy on the outside...just the way I like them and fluffly on the inside.  My daughter gave the thumbs up to her hot dog and devoured the whole thing.  My companions enjoyed their food as well.  The one drawback I would say is that the service was slow.  We waited for our drink order to be taken and the waited for our drinks.  Our drinks were not refilled very quickly.  It was not super busy when we were there so maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Will I go back...yes, because the value was there.  It was a good burger for the price, with or without the coupon."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm the Duke on @Yelp or the Mayor on @FourSquare or something so I should probably write a review huh?  So I've been in probably four times and liked it four times, in particular the guacomole burger with bacon and grilled onions.  They make a good, straightforward guac here, no tomato to adulterate it, no bastardization with mayo or some other foreign spread.  Just avacados, peppers, maybe some lime or lemon juice and some salt.  That's all guac needs really.  Service has been great every time, the prices are reasonable...people, why aren't more of you eating here?    This is a great local spot for burgers, BLT's and the like."}
{"text":"I was a bit worried when I walked in and I was the only person in the restaurant. I'm glad I persevered.   If you want a sense of what this place is like, imagine driving across the country and stopping in at a restaurant in a little town where the highway doubles as Main Street. That's where David's belongs.  The atmosphere is uber casual, long and thin with booths lined up against one wall and a soda fountain against the other. When you are the only bloke in the place, service better we fast and friendly and it was. Can't speak to if it were busy.  I had the basic burger. It was delicious. Easily the best I have had in forever. Why? Great ingredients: Tillamook cheese, hand pressed patty, generous fresh lettuce tomato and onion.  Far as I am concerned, burgers don't need to be fancy, just generous helpings of the best fixings. Unfortunately, point deduction for the fries. They were the kind with the coating to keep them crisp. Not a big fan.  So bottom line. I'd you are in Scottsdale and want a great old fashioned burger, this is your place"}
{"text":"Great hamburgers! Love their guacamole and the Mexican food is awesome... there is never a wait in this quaint eatery and the service is usually great! It is a family favorite."}
{"text":"David's seems kind of hit or miss. I've been several times and the first time was definitely the best that got me hooked. I always get the burger (plain) with fries and a milkshake. I love the food, cooked well, nice seasoning and great shakes!  I think the price is right for what you get, the decorations are really cute, like diner and pinup-ish, however the staff seems really annoyed by idk questions about the food or asking for a side of sauce or whatever. They looked at me like I was crazy when I asked to get my menu back to see what kind of flavors they have for ice cream, \"Well, you can just go look...\" OKAY, but I'm asking you now, then I explained I wanted shake flavors and she told me a couple. I got up and looked at the menu later and would have ordered different ones if I had gotten my menu back. Shake my head. I definitely don't let that get me down though with how cozy the place is and yummy the food is!  Usually it's not that busy with plenty of seating and occasionally they have obscure performers, first time I was there they had a duel piano player, haven't seen him since though.   Decor: 4/5 Staff: 2.5/5 Food: 4/5 Wait: 4/5 Price: 4/5"}
{"text":"I was told the food would be about 15 mins past the original delivery time...45 mins past those 15 mins and no call or text was just rude.  I attempted many times to contact them to say cancel the order and then food was delivered.  Just the worst."}
{"text":"I came here during the art walk. I got the carne asada burrito and tasted great! Chips and salsa that came along with it tasted good also. Waitress was really sweet even with rude customers. Would come again to try other items"}
{"text":"I'm not aware of many places besides pizza, subs, or Chinese that delivers. This is Mexican and burgers which would be a nice change of pace. But the burgers just aren't restaurant worthy. And don't bother specifying what temperature you want your burger because apparently medium rare=well done. The bacon was floppy and not crisp. The bun was supper soggy in parts. The onion rings probably would've been good if they weren't cold when I got them.  And while we're discussing cold, the burger was cold too.   I ordered the food through the yelp website and delivery was confirmed for 3:01pm. I didn't receive it until almost 3:30. Perhaps that is why all of my food was cold. And it really baffles me that it took so long because the restaurant is literally within walking distance and  it isn't like I ordered it during the lunch rush. Don't confirm a specific delivery time if you can't arrive on time, and don't offer delivery if you can't deliver hot food."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed by my recent order. I have ordered from them multiple times. this time, they forgot my onion rings and the sandwich was soggy and gross. I called to inform them that they forgot my onion rings and they told me they would send them back out.....an hour and a half later nothing. I then called back up and this time i spoke to a guy a he said that he didn't know they were supposed to send anything back out. it was just completely bad customer service. if you screw something up, you don't promise to fix it and then don't deliver. I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Came to old town with some friends and we decided to come to this place for lunch. The interior of the restaurant  has absolutely nothing special about it (tables, chairs, and 2 televisions. The restaurant appeared to be clean, the staff was good and the food came out a fair about of time (8 people party). I had the grilled chicken sandwich with 50 /50 fries & onion rings. The food was good and the food portion was large enough to fill a normal person. I eat a lot since I workout and my order didn't fill me up. The rest of my party also had good food portions. The price was decent as well. This is a good place to come to if you are just looking for a hamburger / sandwich joint."}
{"text":"David's is a really great place to grab a burger! It's a small shop with a 50's feel to it. They also offer shakes/malts, Mexican food, and breakfast (all day). I managed the Texas Burger, Amy enjoyed a David's Original - both were perfect. They could spend a few bucks on updating the sparse decor... but it's still cute and one of the best damn deals for your dollar in Scottsdale. I am planning to return soon to sample breakfast."}
{"text":"We stopped there after a bit of shopping. I was going to go for chili burger (I love my chili burgers) but because we hadn't eaten breakfast (this was 6 p.m. at night!), I instead went for the shrimp and avocado omelette - and contrary to another reviewer here, it was fresh, chock full of shrimp - in every bite - and delicious. In fact the only thing that was wrong was the burnt wheat toast but because the omelette was so good, it was easy to overlook it.  Plenty of great food - my parents who are finicky also enjoy their breakfasts - and our waitress was wonderful. I'd like to get back there soon and try their burgers and french dips.  From what I understand the owner is the son of the previous restaurant owners who ran a Kosher-style deli that was never open when we wanted our deli fix. The son (if that is who he is) has done good."}
{"text":"I was expecting better. Fries are not piled high as it states on the menu. Way overpriced if the portion I received is considered normal. Nice wait staff. No plans to return. Will look for other burger options in the future. Disappointed. =RAY="}
{"text":"I ordered some nachos online at 4:00 pm, and after an hour and a half called in to see what's up. Apparently, the driver dropped it off at the wrong apartment. After talking with the manager, he said I wouldn't be charged and he'll send another out right away. Almost 4 hours later, it's 7:42 and I still don't have nachos."}
{"text":"Good simple real cooking using real ingredients no corporate prepackaging or Chemical enhancements cooked fresh from scratch nothing fancy, yet everything tasty I trust the ingredients and I trust the consistency. I love the price."}
{"text":"Finally a place that delivers to my house that's NOT Chinese or pizza! I've only tried this place once but I can say I was very pleased with my experience and will definitely be ordering from them again. The menu has a lot so you don't feel stuck and the prices are very reasonable, my boyfriend got the Texas Burger which he was raving about, and I got a chimichanga. The burger was huge and the chimi was even bigger. The best part was when I called in the order they estimated about 20-25 minute delivery time and the food actually arrived in less than 25 minutes! I'll have to stop in one day and have lunch so I can check out the actual restaurant, but til then NO MORE PIZZA delivery!! At least for a while."}
{"text":"1st time here.... Its 7pm on Thursday May 23 and its closed.... not good... there are alot people walking around this area... I was so looking forward to eating here. I dont get many chances when I'm in the area.. now I may never get another opportunity.."}
{"text":"Love this place, order for delivery all the time. And by all the time it's usually 3-4 times a month. The guac burger is my go to now. Best thing you ever get. ONLY get a shake if you can handle that amount of food.   You have to give it a try.   PS. The delivery guy is always quick and courteous"}
{"text":"The perfect storm of circumstance, opportunity and Yelp Talk all came together today:)  The resulting irresistible mountainous wave of food based desire pushed me down the street, and back to David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food:)  I've been there several times since I wrote the original review and I will submit that there aren't many better spots for a burger, vanilla malt, or chicken mole` in Scottsdale (and I think I would bet money on the fact there aren't any other places where you could get all three in the same lunch order:)  Today was special, I saw a talk thread started by Samantha O, asking about chili, and remembered (that's right...so good I remembered it:) a chili-size I had there a couple of months ago...chili-licious:)  I also ran my morning route along the canal (6 miles, didn't get mugged, decapitated or any of the other things that are rumored to happen to unsuspecting canal joggers...perhaps it's because I'm a suspecting canal jogger:)...at any rate, I was sorely in need of a retox:)  And Pure is closed (another 1/2 written review, down the drain...oh well:) and it was probably too early to have a cocktail at Brackin's (even though it appears they are now open at noon! :-)  So I thought, \"OK, I'll take the bullet and try the bowl of chili at David's, to see if it's really that good\"...that's right, I threw myself on the chili bowl so you, my fellow Yelpers, would not have to...  You're Welcome!  David's chili is as good as the rest of their offerings...spicy, no-bean chili, plenty of heat for most flat-landers...if you are like me, you need a bit more heat and David's will hand you the bottle of hot sauce to get you there:-)  Add a vanilla malt and great and friendly service and what more could you ask for from your lunch?  Well, I'll tell you what more you could ask for...you could ask for Tom Jones in Las Vegas, circa 1974, playing on the 4 flat screens, in living, dazzling color...and that's what you would get...yup, \"Delilah\", She's a Lady\" and, interestingly enough, his version of \"Lucy in the Sky, with Diamonds\" serenaded me during my delightful lunch today:-)  Vintage Tom Jones, new art on the wall and consistently terrific food and service move the needle to 5 stars for David's:)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.. if you are looking for super cheap eats along Old Town after checking out all the shops etc this is a place to come. We got enough buy one get one free of lesser or equal value cards from the Farmer's Market and got an incredibly good deal.   Our grill cheese sammiches with onion rings/ french fries were decent. The Texas burger was well liked despite the name (someone in our yelper group who shall remain anonymous said it was more of a Western Burger than a Texas Burger) and our little mini yelper in training liked her hot dog. Service is average and the food quantity is worth the price.    A cheap find (if you have the mini coupon card) or a decent value without the coupon..."}
{"text":"Very happy with our meal.  Fast, friendly and reasonable priced.  Good job David's I had the Route 87 burger.  Fresh grilled mushrooms, onion and Swiss cheese.  Excellent"}
{"text":"Nice staff but .... very dysfunctional. So many people working and not much gets done. Took forever to get a menu.  I should of known better.  It took about 30 minutes to get my order.  Breakfast had zero flavor and eggs were a tad raw."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast and ordered an omelette. The omelette was tasteless, and the hashbrowns were too crispy with no flavor. I would say the best part of my meal was the toast...  The server was very nice and made sure I was taken care of.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food. Our waitress said under 10 words to us none of which I could even hear. I ordered cheese enchiladas plate with no salsa and received cheese rolled in tortilla with no sauce what so ever on them not even red sauce. Rice wasn't cooked and neither were the beans. Yuck. Best part of dinner was my Pepsi & the chips and salsa. Huge waste of money."}
{"text":"While I was home sick today, my boyfriend ordered some food for me just before he left for work for the afternoon. I was surprised because he didn't tell me he ordered it, so it was delightful to see a gentlemen at my door holding a milkshake & a bag of food!   My boyfriend knows me pretty well so he hit the nail on the hammer with ordering the chocolate & peanut butter milkshake, which was still very cold, creamy & excellent! He also got me a slice of apple pie, which was still warm & delicious! But when it came down to the opening the large box, I realized something had went wrong. It was a box of cheesy bacon fries. Normally, for most people that would be an awesome mistake & no one would really care because seemingly everyone loves bacon. Unfortunately, I am one of the rare & few individuals who doesn't not enjoy bacon. I always pick it out or off of things & give it to my boyfriend! But to give them credit, the fries were crispy & hot, covered in awesome tillamook cheddar & generously doused in big hunks of bacon. I tried to eat a few pieces of fries but the bacon flavor was infused in the melty cheese & I just closed the box & put it in the refrigerator for my boyfriend to eat. He just warmed them up under the broiler & loved them but was pretty upset that they didn't deliver his original request for me which was the CARNE ASADA fries! Despite this mix up, the portions were generous, it arrived quickly & it did make my day that I opened my apartment door to a milkshake! Especially while feeling under the weather, it did brighten my day!  I live very close to this place so I think we will check this place out one more time at least to see what it's all about. I want my carne asada fries & they also have Mexican  food & burgers. The milkshake & pie were legit from what I have tried so far, but the bacon fries were a turn off for me personally."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Scottsdale. Period. Perfectly juicy, hot, tasty, ooey cheesy goodness with awesome fries - consistently delicious. Where else can you get such an amazing burger (double) for $8 - especially  in Old Town? Cute diner setting, super friendly wait staff, great music and bottomless fries. I always recommend David's when asked where to get a good burger. I have heard delivery is rather slow, but we opt to dine in - there at least once a month - definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST burger in Old Toen Scottsdale!  AND, the mexican food rates right up there with the best. Breakfast all day. What a find!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service!! Food was cooked perfectly and tasted great! Texas burger was the best I have had in a while!"}
{"text":"I hesitated a moment before choosing three stars.  Let me start out by saying that in all likelihood, I will never go back.  The service was a bit slow, and the food a bit too greasy for me to return. Also,  I ordered a medium rare patty melt that came medium-not pink at all.  On the other hand, the server was very sweet, the iced tea was nicely brewed, my friend ordered a milk shake made with a slice of apple pie that was so good it made me cry, and the grilled chicken taco salad that my other friend ordered looked AWESOME. So let's just say that David's isn't my style, but that's not their fault.    I hear the breakfasts are great...so, maybe."}
{"text":"I was too lazy on a Saturday afternoon to step out and walk a 100 yards to pick up food. Instead I decided to order food from here through UberEATS. I decided to keep it simple and ordered rolled chicken tacos. I hate to admit it, but having lived in San Diego for the last five years has made me somewhat of a taco snob. However, even if I didn't have exceptionally high standards for Mexican food, I would have certainly disliked the food here. To be fair, I only have one data point for my review, but I would certainly expect a lot more for an order as basic as this. Highly doubt I would be returning."}
{"text":"Davids has been good for lunch and dinner before but this Sunday July 17th 2016 at about 10:40am went in for breakfast and the service was dreadful. My own experience was not good but I felt worse for the table that came in and self seated in front of us and were ignored for about 8 minutes by the waitress coming on duty who proceeded to tie up her long straight hair behind the counter flipping it back and forth to get it just right immediately over the eating counter and condiments and neither greet the new table much less offer them water or drinks. The table then walked out as they should have done and when I stood up and brought this to the attention of the staff they looked blankly at me and one of them said \"oh\". The customers were right on the sidewalk outside the front door and none of the staff attempted to go to the door to apologize or offer to re seat them, nothing! Owner of David's please take note: You have a physical location that could bring in so much, but at least for the young girl staff you have on Sunday mornings, they are allowing money to walk right out the door and could not care less even when brought to their attention by other customers like myself. We could definitely tell it was a \"No manager or owner on premises situation. Too sad."}
{"text":"Looks too good to be true but I haven't got the food yet ordered Hamburger Fries onion rings omelette and fruit pancakes all for $ 17.91 I found my get your late-night grub on spot."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery today and it was delicious. I had the eggs Benedict scramble and some sausage and pineapple pancakes. All came in 45 min and nice and hot. My only complaint would be that there wasn't enough hollandaise sauce but I thought it was great! It was also very reasonably priced. I will definitely call again."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here several times. Each order has arrived on time and tasted better than expected for delivery food. I haven't tried the American menu items yet, but if I'm hungry for Mexican food and I don't want to go out to a restaurant, I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale at the awesome AZ store across the street to purchase local fare for my NY besties and they suggested David's hamburgers. It is like an old fashion 50's dive diner. Little hole in the wall place. I got a Gauc hamburger with fries. It was surprisingly, very good. I loved the old fashion looking bar. I would go back maybe for breakfast. That coconut waffle sounds good. The service could be better, not horrid but not great either."}
{"text":"Cheap place open late night but the food is a bit lack luster. I got the shrimp tacos, they were street style which I enjoyed but their was not much flavor and the shrimp was very hard. Instead of Mexican food I would try the American since all the Mexican food we had as a group was the same, nothing special."}
{"text":". David's Orginal Hamburger is a jewel.  Great food, reasonable prices and if you happen to get Samantha as your waitress even better because she can give you a little history of the place.  We had the special- 1/2 sandwich and a great green salad. I had BLT on sour dough, the second person had the tuna and the third had the veggie burger with delicious cold.slaw. We were visiting Old Town Scottsdale and got hungry and we stopped in at David's.  Lucky move on our part!"}
