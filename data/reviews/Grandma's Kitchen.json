{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced nice cozy place that I felt instantly at home. Grandma is great and funny HIGHLY RECOMMEND support local businesses."}
{"text":"A quaint little breakfast place with incredibly friendly people dedicated to their food and service."}
{"text":"There is no place like Grandma's Kitchen in the valley.  If you are looking for a great breakfast and you are in Mesa, then definitely check out this unique place.  Every meal on the menu is homemade and that staff is always wonderful and friendly.  Just like mom used to make?  Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there Saturday morning 1/30/16 with my adult daughter. She found this place on Yelp. What a great homey little place. We ordered one of their homemade cinnamon rolls to share. WOW! They served it warm. So good!! We also had the chicken fried steak which came with gravy, 2 eggs, fried potatoes and toast. Great portions and really good prices. We also took home some homemade cookies for my daughters boyfriend. Would definitely eat here again if we return to town. And highly recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"If you want the cook to come out of the kitchen, then ask for egg whites! This lady literally came out the back to give me a hard time about egg whites! She told me if the yolk breaks oh well thats the way i have to eat them! My friend ordered chicken fried steak and asked for no gravy, that got her out of the kitchen to criticize him for offending her not having her gravy. This place is very smokey and left there smelling like i worked in the kitchen all day. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I was driving one morning,  down Brown rd when we saw their  sign, decided to give them a try, that was like two months ago, and we have been coming here for breakfast at least once a week, i have tried almost everything in there breakfast menu, and everything is delicious. The place is very clean and the people are very friendly, and the prices are good"}
{"text":"I would not recommend Grandma's Kitchen to people with young children. It is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant. I guess just not for children 3 and under. I admit my son's ages 2 and 3 were a little noisy. But I did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite. Grandma also telling my children to use there inside voices. I immediately responded by saying 2 year olds do not understand what an inside voice is and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my wife sound this little restaurant by accident and have been loyal customers ever since. We enjoy breakfast there at least once a week and have never been disappointed. I normally just have  the breakfast special but my wife has tried almost everything on the menu. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes real home cooking."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Grandma's Kitchen it was on Dobson Road, a side street just north of the min street, which, of course, was called Main Street. The tables were spaced far from one another as if they didn't have enough. The wooden floors were a refresher to eateries in AZ that all have cement or other hard flooring. At least the wood didn't echo every sound in the restaurant. Grandma herself greeted me. When asked, she said she was from WI or MN...ooops. I forgot which. In any event, I like milk in my coffee. I do not mean watered down stuff like 1%, 2%, 3%, fat free, skim milk! Just a little \"regular\" milk for my coffee is all I wanted. Out came this bluish colored liquid.  When I asked Grandma is she had milk, she brought more of the same stuff. And she's from daily country. How awful.  The next time I went I brought my own little bottle of milk. And I did that only because I was supporting a local business, not like the \"THE GOOD INCOMPETE EGG,\" as we now call it, or \"US Incomplete Egg\" places that do not serve milk either. So Grandma outright lied. Hmmmph!  Then that Dobson Rd. location was closed. The restaurant, which had limited hours ---so strange--- relocated to the corner of Main Street and Dobson Road, the site of a former donut shop. My wife and I gave it another chance. Not once, but twice we were treated rather abruptly. It was on the borderline of being rude to customers. The place was smaller than the original spot on Dobson. The menu was so so. The food was OK. We generally went for breakfast, not as much as an early lunch. I don't recall if the menu differed at specific times of the day.  My wife was insulted by a wait person, and Grandma seemed not to care. Well, Grandma, your grandkids (customers) will never come back again.  We spoke at home of Grandma's Kitchen several times and mentioned how NOT to run a business. Ahah...I passed the location last week and Grandma's is gone...closed up. Whoever takes this spot, take some advice. Treat customers well and they will return. That goes for product quality as well as delivering a warm welcome. Aloha Grandma! You just didn't try."}
{"text":"Grandma's Kitchen.............it looked like grandmas kitchen, but didnt feel like it. The decor was pretty solid and had a country feel. I wanted to like this place, I really did.................My GF and I decided to have breakfast here on a Saturday moring.   There was no one there when we arrived, service was prompt and items were delivered prompt. I had no clue what my waitress' name was or her helper. There was no review of the specials or the daily quiche availability.   There was plenty of time to decide on what to order,........though i could feel the service staffs eyes burning a hole in the back of my head while I reviewed the menu.   I could also hear the Cooks kitchen conversation going on, it wasnt vulgar or anything but honestly it was kinda weird, and not that cooks are supposed to look professional or anything, but when they come out of the back to get coffee, maybe say hi rather than staring at us from the other side of the counter.   Portions were good, I am Biased against fake eggs, by fake eggs I mean Eggbeaters and this is what they use for Omelets, no flavor at all. The Sausage patties were pretty good but kinda thin. There was also an unusual display fridge with items in it, not sure what it was for, or what the items inside were for.  I gave this a 2 star rating because of atmosphere, service staff and price.   I also think a local paper would go a long way......  They Swung for the fences and hit a foul ball."}
{"text":"My sister who is on her travels, her hubby and two friends are there right now having breakfast; wish I was with them.  I really like this homey feeling place, stuff on the walls looking like a \"family environment\".  She lives in Redding, we live in Cathedral City, I would love to go again to visit this place.  Food is yummy.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We are from Las Vegas and we are always looking for local places to try. If you are in the Mesa area and are looking for some home cooking you need to come here!! It's small and personalized and the food was absolutely the best. We had various breakfast items and my wife had their BLT with avocado and tomato basil soup. The BLT and soup were amazing. BTW, the cookies are to die for. I highly recommend anyone to eat here and will do the next time we are in Mesa."}
{"text":"The folks that run this restaurant are a hard-working , small- business -owning family. The atmosphere is causal and homey. My 9 -year- old loves the biscuits and gravy.  My 8-year-old says, \"It is delicious always, no matter what time of day.\" It is still her favorite restaurant even after she was chastised for drinking the little creamers on the table ( I loved that they kept it real and backed me up as I taught restaurant behavior). It feels like my mother's kitchen, I get to take a break while someone else cooks up some homemade,down-to-earth food. The owners give the kids toys to occupy themselves while we wait and one to take home. Every mom should try this restaurant when they need to take a break and recharge."}
{"text":"Great food loved the banana pancakes for breakfast. ..great service very nice! Vegetable soup very good homemade! Homemade cooking tastes like your grandma's cooking."}
{"text":"I had a doctors appointment on Brown Road and googled for a nearby restaurant.  Grandma's kitchen and Denny's came up so we decided to try Grandma's Kitchen.  What a great choice.  I can't understand why the place wasn't packed.  This place is a hidden gem.  We had breakfast.  The service was fast and the food was great.  I had potatoes and gravy and my husband had the ham and eggs.  The potatoes we really good.  (Not like the hard square and obviously frozen ones they give you at Village Inn.)  They kept the coffee refilled and the waitress (Grandma's daughter) was sincerely nice.  The prices were very reasonable and next time we will try lunch (they have a Reuben sandwich, and I love Reuben's)  This is a small family owned and run business with a homey atmosphere.  I think you'll be pleased, as we were."}
{"text":"Awesome home style breakfast just like Grandma used to make.   We all loved it.   Great visit with Grandma.    Stop in you won't be disappointed.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place! We literally met Grandma and Grandpa, along with their daughter and granddaughter. Not only was the food delicious, but Grandpa knew how to entertain our 5 year old by letting him pick out a toy from a special pail. He also brought out two little cars for him to play with and make him feel right at home. I felt like we were at someone's house, not a restaurant. Very homey feel and good people who I want to support again!!!"}
{"text":"Just found this place and can't wait to back again. It's real home cooking and I felt like my grandma had made me breakfast today. It was good. It's a family owned family run business and it really is grandma doing the cooking I love that!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, even at it's old location.  The food it great, the portions are what we fat Americans should be eating, the prices are great, there is a play area for the kids, and Grandma even lets the kids pick out a toy from her bucket when you leave.  Too the two people that thought Grandma was rude, you must have done something pretty bad to get scolded or treated rude by Grandma.  I brought a party of 12 in once and she brought all our food out at once except my husbands, his arrived about 5 minutes later, and she took more then half off of our bill without us even complaining, needless to say, that time I was happy too pay the bill for a party of 12!  I love this place, it's like when you go to a small town and everyone waves, just really friendly, a great place to go for good people."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place, now adapting to a new location after over 25 years in the business! It's conveniently located between a Bashas' store and a CVS pharmacy.  I'm puzzled as to why anyone would rate it poorly.   My wife and I just moved to this area from Austin, Texas, where we had lots of outstanding breakfast places. We ate at most of them!   Grandma's Kitchen has extra pleasant and attentive staff, excellent food, in a clean and homey cafe. My wife had eggs over easy, crispy bacon, potatoes, and an English muffin. I had scrambled eggs, sausage patties, grits, and rye toast. My wife, a genuine foodie, loved her breakfast, and I was delighted with mine. I would not have changed a thing about it.   We talked with Grandma before we left, and she indicated that her husband, or Grandpa, often entertains guests. I asked if he does cartwheels, and she said he would upon request.  We plan to go back! Want to try lunch there too. Maybe Grandpa will do those cartwheels!"}
{"text":"I love Grandma's. It's close to where I work so I often go there for lunch. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the veggie melt sandwich. Prices are average, the atmosphere is nice and homey. And sometimes Grandma stops at your table for a chat :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very good breakfast here last week, while my son and I were at spring training.  Located very close to Hohokam Stadium, so we stopped by before an A's day game.    As we walked-in, the place was almost packed and filled with fellow A's and Cubs fans enjoying breakfast.  We were seated promptly and I really enjoyed the decorations and interior of this restaurant.  It has a very comfortable feel to it and the staff were very warm and friendly.    My son ordered the french toast, while I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs.  The french toast was really good and they served it with hot syrup, which is always a nice touch.  My corned beef hash was grilled and had a nice crisp to it, which I really like.  They also served it with country potatoes and onions that gave it that extra flavor.  They had a good selection of jelly's for my wheat toast too.    Service was really good and the staff didn't rush us at all.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals and you can sense the friendly atmosphere of this restaurant."}
{"text":"There is only one reason why I would not give this place \"5\" stars.  It's only because they should reconsider naming the place \"Grandma's B!t@hin' The food is really good but the owner likes to come around and complain about past customers while you eat.  It's kind of off putting.  Otherwise, everyone is really nice.  The atmosphere is more than pleasant and you can't beat the breakfast."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a bit throughout the years.  I found Grandma's Kitchen when she was originally on off Downtown Mesa's Main Street & Robson.  I've always loved the homey feel of the place and seeing all the photos of her grandchildren plastered all over the walls.  This grandma loves her grandkids!  She's always there to say hello to her customers and to make everyone feel welcomed.    My favorite dish is her Spinach Quiche with Fresh Fruit.  It's the best!  It's not a froo froo place.  So if you're looking for a fancy hoity toity sort of place and food, this isn't the place for you!  But...if you're looking for a good ol' down to earth home cooked meal, this is it!  I gave her 5 stars because it's really like \"going to grandma's kitchen\".    Great place for breakfast  & Lunch!!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall.  Amazing food. Grandma herself even corrected my sons table manners for slurping at the table."}
{"text":"If you like someone being a total b#@$^ to you then Grandma's is the place! Grandma? Maybe Hitler or Sadam."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! Great breakfast and pecan waffles yummy! Friendly service and we even got to meet grandma! This place is a wonderful find I recommend highly!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great, quaint spot for breakfast! The older couple running the place were fantastic-super attentive and pleasant. The food was good with big portions. Service was quick and prices fantastic. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love Grandma's Kitchen...literally feel like I am back home in the south eating at my grandma's table! Portions are big and price is low, decor is eclectic and southern, each table set with all kinds of mix-match items, and they even keep a toy box in the back for kids! We keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to eat. Owners were very nice and food is excellent with reasonable prices. Everything g is made from scratch gem of a restaurant I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Home style cooking and it came out really quickly. Had one of the omelettes and the biscuits and gravy and would definitely come back. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Grandma's Kitchen is kind of what you would expect for restaurant outside of a motel. It is small and we came in on a Saturday and had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to clear. It isn't the greatest food by any means, but it's not bad. I ordered a chef salad. It's all basically stuff chopped from standard processed packaging. Adequate and filling but nothing that stands out. Not that exciting. I didn't get any saltines. Do I really have to ask?  The ice tea was delicious and service was good.   Grandma herself seemed annoyed when my friend ordered her BLT without any bread. Her reaction seemed almost irritated.   I think the pies looked good and fresh baked, with huge dallops of ice cream. I'm sure breakfast is the real deal here. Check your arteries at the door.   I doubt I'd come back honestly. There just isn't that much to make it stand out."}
{"text":"It was a great breakfast restaurant. Good prices and the food was great.the waitter was awesome."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place. I always use Yelp when. Traveling and choose places based upon reviews. We expected a wait on a Sunday since it has such a good rating but much to our surprise we could sit immediately. It's definitely a family business with personal service. I asked for  my eggs to be well done. They were perfect and on top of it the owner actually checked with me to make sure they were cooked to my request. Don't miss."}
{"text":"This place has become one of our Saturday morning stops. We discovered them about four months ago and we are so glad we did.    They are tucked away into a small shopping center. The restaurant is tiny, but that gives it a cozy atmosphere. It is decorated with photos and artworks from the owners family, which I love. It really gives the feeling that you are sitting in Grandma's Kitchen.  The owner and her daughter are incredibly nice and they run a tight ship. We have never had bad service, and they will hang out and chat with the regulars when they have the time.  Of course, the best part is the food. This place, hands down, is the best place to get breakfast in Mesa. Out of all of our visits, we have yet to find something that wasn't five star quality.  My absolute favorite is their homemade grits. Grits are something that is hard to find properly done, especially here in Phoenix. Grandma's are fluffy, flavorful, and creamy. Their French toast is fantastic, and when they have it, their green chile scrambled eggs are to die for!  I cannot recommend them enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & such caring people. Grandma herself came out various times to make sure everything was great! Gave us extra bacon when they had to get more supplies for our chicken fried steak. So sweet!"}
{"text":"Good wholesome breakfast in Mesa, Arizona. We were here on vacation and so happened to stumble into this joint. My bf and his parents were all vacationing here. It's a little catchy place with decors that you will see at your \"grandma's house.\" The price and portions are good. The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"My grandmothers weren't this rude and their cooking was INFINITELY better-tasting.  Don't waste the trip.  I ordered eggs that had absolutely no taste to them.  The waitress went out of her way to be rude to me and other guests there.    HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service (I think they are mentally ill) and very bad food."}
{"text":"We found this spot on our way to a spring training game at Hohokum field. We are from Las Vegas but on our next trip back we will definitely dine here again. I recommend this place to anyone who likes home cooked from scratch real deal food. You really feel like you are sitting in grandma's kitchen having your meal. The staff is super helpful and more than courteous. My husband had biscuits and gravy I had the French toast breakfast combo. Huge portions and great prices too boot."}
{"text":"I've tried different places to eat biscuits and gravy nothing is better than this place i really liked it screw Dennys"}
{"text":"Stopped off for lunch. Ordered a burger and fries. Tastey!  Beef was grilled just right, vegetable were fresh, and there fries were air fried! Next time, I am definitely trying other options.  \"Support small business\""}
{"text":"Grandma's a major grump. I pulled over to take a break (I'm a driver) and I was sitting in the nearly empty parking lot with about 100 empty spaces around me on my phone. I was literally thinking, \"this looks like a sweet place. It should be busier on a Sunday morning. Maybe I'll go get my kids and bring them for breakfast (I live nearby) an angry woman came out and knocked on my window to tell me I was taking up two parking spaces. I thanked her for pointing it out to me and drove away (laughing). Unfortunately, it left a bad taste in my mouth an my kids and I (and any of the 20 passengers I have per day... 1500 this year) will never know if the food is any good."}
{"text":"It appears Grandma's has moved to the SW corner of Country Club and Main St., in Mesa.  We will see if the space is as noisy now.  I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Was looking for a breakfast place so we decided to stop at Grandma's Kitchen.. The atmosphere was so-so, they should have had music on or something! The waitress wasn't mean or rude, just kinda surly. I ordered the bacon, spinach and mushroom omelette, minus the 'shrooms. When I got the omelette I noticed the spinach didn't look very fresh, and upon first bite I could taste it: CANNED SPINACH!! Ew. I'm assuming the mushrooms would have been canned too, glad I left them off.."}
{"text":"The Denver scramble was good.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  The price is excellent.  They relocated from Main and Country Club. Today they are located SW of Mesa Dr and Brown.   Don't take your own drink in there or you will get scolded."}
{"text":"This place is small, but very quaint. The employees are all family and show great service. The food is amazing and grandma talk to you a jokes with you. She witty and sassy so don't any offence in her humor. Overall great atmosphere and wonderful dinning experience. Very sweet grandpa too to my young son letting him play with toys while eating his food."}
{"text":"Support your local small Grandma!  My husband and I have been here a few times as we are big lovers of breakfast.  What a wonderful find!  You want home made?  Go here!  You want small atmosphere?  Go here!  You want good down home cooking like your mama and your Grandma most definitely made?  Go here!  You want big fat French toast?  Definitely go here!  You want an amazing omelet?  GO HERE!  Best thing I love, is Grandma's kitchen is definitely a family run restaurant.  Right down to the grand kids, which means to me, they are learning strong values and skills, old school!  Don't pass it by!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in Mesa. Enjoyable slow down to eat with the family. Staff was awesome and friendly.  Like gong to your grandmas. Thank you for the great traditional breakfast food."}
{"text":"Awesome food yummy homemade soup ...breakfast was great as well banana pancakes were my favorite ! Everything is homemade tasks like your grandmas cooking !"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast cooked by Grandma. We had many different items all of which were very good. Highly recommend the quiche (I had the spinach and cheddar -soooo good). The French toast, pancakes are all so good. Recommend Grandmas Highly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to support Mom and Pop businesses.  This one was such a disappointment.  We were the only customers so the service was quick and friendly.  My husband had the corned beef hash and I had the special, a Western Scramble.  It came out of the kitchen quickly.  The hash browns looked delicious and would have been but they were lukewarm.  The corned beef hash was good and hot.  My scramble was warm, lots of green peppers that had not been cooked, a few crumbles of bacon and NO cheese.  We won't be back.  Sad way to start the morning.."}
{"text":"Grandma's Kitchen was a wonderful find.  Fresh delicious food in a bright clean atmostphere.  There is a little play area where kids can entertain themselves while the grownups visit making this the most peaceful meal we've had with the 6 year old.  My Egg Salad on marble rye and potato salad ($6.50) tasted just like my mother made.  They were made with nothing but the basic ingredients.  The bread was soft and fresh.  Good iced coffee for only a buck-fifty.   My daughter got a Croissant Club ($8.50) she said was top quality.  The kids meal was $4.50 for a hot dog, applesauce, cookie and drink, and my new granddaughter ate every bit of it.  The peach cobbler was okay but not to die for.  But our overall experience was just great.   I highly recommend this place--and my fellow Grandma makes everything personal.  Hours are roughly 7am to 3pm but she was stilll making sandwiches for walk-ins at 4pm in spite of cleaning up.  I like a business that puts serving their customers first.  There is plenty of seating and we lucked out and were able to park right out front.  There are a few tables outside, but considering it was, like, 112 degrees out, we chose the cool inside tables.  Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this spot, though my daughter had been to it before and also gave it good marks.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives because I do actually think there were a few...  The food wasn't bad, I ordered the Ham and Cheese omelet and I wish the ham was in thinner pieces and the potatoes were too soft and mushy - I really liked the french toast and they had HOT syrup and it was so good! You get great portions to what you pay for, so make sure you're hungry.  Negatives...  I think this place should be renamed \"Angry Aunt Betty's Kitchen\" I wouldn't say the waitresses were 'mean' but the environment was angry; it had no purpose, no identity, no \"grandma's kitchen\" feel.   To be honest Grandma's Kitchen felt like a re-purposed coffee house...and since I've lived in this area for a while, I know it WAS a  coffee house. I'm not overly impressed with the service and since they don't have that to fall back onto, I will go to a number of other places - sorry Grandma, you just ain't cuttin' it!"}
{"text":"Very fast service, got to meet \"grandma\" who is a very sweet lady. Food is your traditional breakfast food that will fatten you up."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly service. It does feel like a real family place.  Only about 9 tables in the whole place but it is worth the wait.  Was there for breakfast and all of was prepared extremely well.  This is a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Best quiche I've had!! Yummy food in a fun and campy atmosphere cooked by grandma. They have tables outside also!. Very generous portions and friendly staff. Healthy options and the freshest fruit. Only downside..Before leaving I needed to use the restroom and you need to go through the kitchen to get to it. I told her I didn't mind at all and she replied \"yes but I DO!!\". She was rude and meant it. She doesn't like people traipsing through her kitchen, but she has to know if you have a restaurant you need a restroom for patrons!! I won't go back because I was made to feel as if I was imposing and annoyed her."}
{"text":"This is a delightful place you should take note of and visit to eat within.  Very nice people, a cozy dining area, excellent selections for breakfast -- and superlative prices.  Customer service is excellent and very accommodating.  Al fresco dining, no less!  I had the three-meat omelette -- delicious! -- and my friend had the Biscuits & Gravy  combo (with eggs, sausage and potatoes).  Considering that you'll pay 50% more for a much poorer quality of food at most restaurants serving breakfast, this is a wonderful place to eat.  The owner is very nice, both compelling and personable, a great lady to chat with."}
{"text":"\"Holy moly donut shop\" the flies were flying and dead ones on my chair when we sat. Moldy bread was served then replaced.  Like most of the area the place needs to be cleaned then recleaned... new chairs as well!  Been coming here for years... need that clean  loving country grandma feel back. For now it was pretty scary. Toy should be disinfected as well with EVERYTHING in that TOY bucket gift holder for every kid, my child's toy was sticky from what seemed like syrup."}
{"text":"Well I love this place!!! Awesome country fried steak and corned beef hash.  Love grandma too! Some ppl may call her rude but I think she is very real. No phony waitresses here. I don't know about anyone else but she is just like my grandma. Don't take no crap frm anyone. For sure worth a try if lookin for a great breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Nasty. Grandma farts in the restaurant and she uses her nasty smell to disinfect her nasty contaminated place. Nasty. You will get so sick after eating the dumpster food she served here."}
{"text":"I had chicken fried steak.  It tasted like the meat had turned.  I politely told the owner, she huffily said that was impossible because she just bought the meat. Then she dumped it in the trash without tasting it to verify my problem.  It would have been nice if she took my complaint seriously and looked into it.  I noticed that three employees were smoking outside when I walked up.  If the cook smokes she would not be able to taste or smell bad meat.  The owner did not let me pay, but I left a $5 tip anyway."}
{"text":"I only get an hr for lunch, To me speed of service is priority, since I don't have that much time; I order the California croissant and got the sup to starts before I even finished my sup they brought my food to the table. I give them a ten for service and quality of food"}
{"text":"I almost didnt get to have a chance to try the food! The place is very country like and gives you the feeling that you are in a place that will have good down home country food. The food was ok. The reason I almost didnt get a chance to try was because with Grandmas attitude and rude manor aai had to talk my wife into staying and not walking out! Glad my grandma wasnt like that!"}
{"text":"Ok so I woke up super early and was staving. I wanted a great breakfast. I decided g'mas kitchen. I'm not sure why she has any bad reviews? This was my third visit; not only is she really nice but very accommodating. She let me in a few min b4 they opened and was super sweet.  Now to the food: sausage egg and cheese bagel, really good no complaints just raves, then to my favorite the grits she made them cheese grits and they were amazing! I'm from the southeast and grew up on grits, my gma would be proud how well these grits turned out. Love this small place and super nice people"}
{"text":"Grandma is literally cooking your meal...Good Food and wonderful service. A must come back kind of place."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy were so delicious I wish I could suck them through a straw so I could eat more and faster.  I was skeptical seeing it was in a mini mall parking lot.  It's tiny and quaint, and we absolutely loved the pictures of what looked like Grandkid's graduation pictures on the wall.  The service was good and fast and the owner's were so sweet and accommodating. I'm from Scottsdale, but would drive down here again for breakfast anyday, and I'm sure I'll be craving those biscuits in a few days!!"}
{"text":"On our way to St. Louis, Missouri we made a stop in Mesa, Arizona for brunch. We found Grandma's Kitchen Home Cooking that completely does justice to it's name. The menu is simple but with enough options for all appetites. The food came out relatively quickly and was good, the \"homie\" taste you expect given the name of the place. Grandma and grampa both very attentive and nice  with outstanding service. Definitely a place to visit if you are in Mesa."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, I got the chicken fried steak and it came with mashed potatoes and the gravy that comes on the steak. Also some green beans and a side salad that comes out first. All in all the food was good.   Coming in was confusing. We weren't greeted and since it was our first time there we were very confused. Because it's a cozy place I'm ok with there not being a hostess stand. But I do feel like someone should be on top of greeting the guests so that we know how the waiting works (you just walk in and stand awkwardly at the door and they ask who was there first when they have a table ready.)  All in all it's so so. But I do love that it's a famiky business and the food was good"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Despite the other reviews I still went, with some hesitation. I walked in and was greeted by (I think a granddaughter?) the waitress, and was told I could sit where I wanted. My drink order was taken and a menu was given to me. I chose the Denver Omlette, with wheat toast, and a cinnamon roll  (because I am a fatty and have been on a competition diet for 6 months). Coffee came, and water (which I didn't have to ask for), and shortly there after my food came. Let me just say that I gave this place 5 stars specificially because of their potatoes which were crispy where they needed to be and had a ton of flavor. Their omlette was awesome, nice and fluffy, really big pieces of green pepper, ham, and onions, YUM. Their cinnamon roll, over flowing with icing and butter. Omg, SO good. Let me just say... if you act like a jackass to Grandma, she will treat you like one right back. The staff wasn't rude, as previous reviews suggested. The place was very clean, and did remind me of my Grandma's kitchen except not Polish."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a mom and pop homemade style type of food Grandma's Kitchen was really good and there service was great! I had there breakfast I got the biscuit and country gravy combo, it also came with 2 eggs, home-style potatoes, and choice between bacon, ham, or sausage ( I got the bacon and it was mid-thick cut bacon super good). All this food for a very reasonable price $. and I left full and satisfied. I will be eating here again"}
{"text":"Good $1 cookies.  Service is not so good, ignore customers, busy chatting with people instead of helping customers."}
{"text":"5 stars for stellar service. Owners are kind people, I was browsing on my phone and was offered the wi-fi password. Attentive without being overbearing. Comfort food with large portions. Love supporting places like this!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was impressed by the breakfast. I would have taken a picture of the biscuits and gravy the two eggs, home cooked fries and bacon but I literally inhale the food. The owner was there and greeted every customer that came in, she was a a straight forward but sweet lady. Small but nice little place to get breakfast.   I will definitely be back. Thanks for the great experience and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Grandma's Kitchen is a cute place in downtown Mesa. The garman GPS had it listed as a breakfast place so it was an easy choice.  My boss and I were in Mesa for a couple days for work and I told him I wanted to try something other than a chain place. When we found Grandma's it looked like a nice hole-in-the-wall homey place.  No traffic outside and not many customer's there so I'm not sure how it survives, but it has potential. The food was ok, but nothing special. I had the ham and cheese omelette with biscuits and gravy. The omelette was good and the bscuits tased homemade, but the gravy had zero flavor and was quite watery. My boss had the berry waffle and said it was pretty awesome.  I will likely be back in Mesa a couple times a year and will this place a try again. Since my boss loved his waffle and my omelette was good I am giving a good rating but can't give it a great rating yet."}
{"text":"I see that I can update my last review and is that ever a good thing! It seems that Grandma can't take constructive criticism as since I wrote the review, she has now found me on facebook and began harassing me. This woman has got to be the most unprofessional business person I have EVER encountered in my life and I think I may just go to the news about her!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked that Grandma's Kitchen has been open as long as it has (and could afford to move to a great location). The food is mediocre at best, and the service is off the charts bad.  My boyfriend and I had breakfast here twice before swearing never to come again. His omelet was so-so, and my oatmeal was watery and possibly instant. The toast was good, but that's not a shock.  The seating area is crowded with furniture that obviously doesn't suit the space. It's hard to move around in the restaurant, there's no waiting area, and you have to climb over high-back stools in order to attempt to pay at the cash register. (If people can't get to their counter, they should accept payments at the table.)  The worst part of the restaurant is the service. When we first visited, there was a grouchy late-middle-aged woman we thought might be Grandma. She ignored the customers, and some even left after being seated but before eating. On our second visit, we met Grandma. What a nasty, irritable monster. I'll never spend a dime on a place that behaves this way to its customers. Shame on you, Grandma."}
{"text":"Loved everything about the food and grandma and grandpa. Wanted to buy one of her tshirts but she only uses them for staff"}
{"text":"My grandma loved me.  This grandma only offered me . . . . margarine?    Really?  In today's day and age and grandma has no butter?  Its not just about science here, its about taste.  Unfortunately grandma didn't have that either.  The hash-browns were flavorless.  The ham was only cooked on one side.  The french toast had a form of cinnamon in it but it still lacked in flavor, explain to me how that is possible?  I'm still perplexed.  The maple syrup was a far, distant step cousin to anything maple.  The coffee, a measure in any restaurant, was miserably lacking.  We went to Grandma's Kitchen based on the two reviews here on Yelp and I was sadly, sadly misled.  :("}
{"text":"Wow, what a great little spot!  I found this place while wondering around Mesa, and its a cute little spot.  Serve breakfast and lunch.  Great large layout, plenty of seating, and cutely decorated.  Like Michael C said, it has a great little midwestern feel to it.    While I was here, I ordered the chese omlette. Came with hashbrowns, and the food was tasty.  I felt like I got a good amount of food for my $$.  The service was really personal, and that was great!  Lovely little place.  This would be a place that I would come to eat and read the sunday paper, take my mom to, or just spend time at with a good friend, as the atmosphere was relaxed and allowed you to not be overwhelmed with noise or a small cramped dining room."}
{"text":"First the good: reasonable prices, good food, clean place, food came out hot and quick The bad: The first time my friend and I went here the service felt a little hostile. My friend and I did not rush through our meal. There were plenty of empty tables. \"Grandma\" started to hint that we should leave after about an hour. At about 1 1/2 hours it was clear we were not welcome. We still tipped more than 20%. The second time we went here, \"Grandma\" immediately made a comment on how long we stayed the previous week. With no one else in the place, she told us we could stay 2 hours but that was all. We again tipped 20% but will certainly not be back again. I felt we were sized up as soon as we sat down the first time and it was down hill from there. A kind word was never spoken to us although other customers did seem to fare better."}
{"text":"Great experience here! Good food, good service and a really pleasant chat with the owner. Small businesses doing it right!   We ordered a biscuit and gravy breakfast with eggs and sausage patties and a 3-meat omelette. Everything was delicious- I loved the breakfast potatoes!"}
{"text":"I worked at Subway across the street from Grandma's Kitchen. My ride had to drop me off an hour early in the mornings because she had work herself. I had time to kill and decided to have coffee and use the wifi on my tablet at this neat little diner. I went in and ordered. It was the first time I was in there, grandma was in the back, the son in the front, and there were no other customers. Idle chit-chat, the son was friendly enough. Very upbeat and friendly young man. Odd too, considering it was 7:30AM.  I chose to take a table outside, sip my coffee, and browse online.  The son was smoking. A familiar smell wafted by, and then I knew why the son was so upbeat and friendly. It was, of course, marijuana. I must have made a face because the son chuckled, \"You didn't smell that.\" Grandma starts coming outside and he snuffs his joint.  Grandma asked me to leave because I had no plans to eat. I felt so uncomfortable I didn't even finsh my coffee. I left. And I'll never return to Grandma's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch in downtown Mesa. The food is above average, and the pricing very reasonable. I eat here about once a week (close to work). I would pick a local place like this over Denny's, Coco's and the like any day. They offer unique off-menu specials like: grandma's meatloaf, spinach quiche, and blueberry pancakes almost every day.  No waiting, the place is somewhat large and never too crowded. Has the look and feel of a mid-western breakfast spot.  The staff are very polite and helpful, and they get to know you by name."}
{"text":"Really cozy atmosphere when you first walk in. The grandma owner herself took my order but didn't seem to be as \"friendly\" as you would think. The breakfast food was nothing special and seemed rushed. I would compare the quality of the food to the complementary breakfast at hotels. However the little restaurant just had a nice southern aura about it which would make me go again."}
{"text":"gross and really mean old lady."}
{"text":"\"Maybe next time\".  Brak must be prophetic.  On our next visit, we got to experience the famous \"warmth\" that Grandma is known for.  Let's put it this way - this joint can be about as warm as Hitler's bunker during a power failure in January.  There are too many excellent breakfast options in the area that deserve our business to have to put up with such foolishness.  Sayonara, Grandma."}
{"text":"Just ate here while on vacation and idk how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars. Used yelp to find them and we sure don't regret it. Thanks for the amazing meal and the customer service that made you feel at home."}
{"text":"This very tiny place is hidden in the shopping plaza here on brown and mesa Dr. When we first pulled up to the front it look even more tiny than we expected. The while place had a total of 9 tables. Pretty quite area not many customers in the restaurant when we showed up. The customer service was great. They were sure that our coffee was filled and we were satisfied with the food. The place was decorated very much in a homey kind of way with family photos on the walls.  I ordered the buscuit and gravy with a side of bacon. We probably waited 5 mins total and the food was out. My girlfriend ordered the stack of pancakes and bacon as well. The taste of my buscuit was good. The only thing that bothered me most about the food was how quickly it came out. The bacon you can tell had been cooked previously and heated up either microwave or pan but definitely not fresh. Overall if you are looking for satisfying meal that's not too overpriced this is a good place. Definitely not my favorite bit wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"Food is really average and bland, not what I was hoping for by any means. Weird place in general, not an atmosphere I enjoyed or wanted to come back to anytime soon."}
