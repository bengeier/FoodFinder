{"text":"Utterly fantastic.  Clean, courteous, comfortable. Cheap, but not too cheap. Curry to die for. A+"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty! Very clean and very sleek. Had the pad Thai Tom yum and it was delightful. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Reasonably priced/sized tasty treats.The staff is also, always, really nice. Basically, couldn't ask for more in my book."}
{"text":"Gave this quaint joint 3.5 * really. I won't lie, we were really going to go to the Elephant Thai Bar but walked in this place instead. 2 other people in the restaurant but it was after 1pm. I had the yellow curry with chicken and a side order of spring rolls, and The Mrs had the red curry with vegetables, two cups for water. Decided to sit on patio as weather permitted.  Water was cold but the trap flavor was a bit strong. The wait for our lunch was adequate and at first portions seemed a bit small. The spring rolls were just about the same size as my thumb. Didn't feel it was quite with the $2.99 but we're tasty.  At the end our once thought small portion lunches left us feeling content and not stuffed.  The taste was great, flavorful but not what a 4 Hot should be (little bit on the weak side) however The Mrs 4 hot got her nose to run a bit. Overall take off this was the food was great, portions a bit small for price. The place could have used a solid wipe down as the appears to be greasy prints over the door handles and glass windows (as if a kid with French fries was running around) floors had some debris. I would stop back through.  :-)"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place I've ever been to. I don't have a single complaint because the people who were there didn't leave room for error. I thought this was an experience i could share not only with my family and friends, but with complete strangers. If you want something different for tonight, try their curry or even an amazing stir-fry dish. I can't complement this place enough, the atmosphere, decor, authentic nature, and servers really pull the place together beautifully.   Highly highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried to go to 5 R Cha today and it turns out that they have permanently closed. Very sad, indeed."}
{"text":"Nice Thai place among many other Thai places in Tempe.  What makes this place stand out is how casual it is. 5 R Cha is order at the counter kind of place, and it excels at it. The Pad Thai and Pineapple Curry are the best dishes I've tried.  My only gripe is that they exclusively use disposable plate/silverware even if you dine in. It makes the dine in experience a lot less enjoyable and not environmental friendly. -1 star for that."}
{"text":"Great Thai food for a good price. Right next door to Thai Elephant, pretty much same quality food but cheaper. The Masaman curry and pad thai are great! Also, if you feel like spoiling yourself try the Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle for a delivery. it took them almost 2 hours to get the food over given that the restaurant and my apartment is literally 6 mins car ride away. Tried calling them to ask about the status, no on answer the call. Very disappointed. Foods are okay, not the best, but bearable."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! Try Dynamite Fried Rice! It is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  First time visiting and it was around 6pm and had seen it driving by the place a few times decided to stop by and try it.  Walked in and it was very clean, and the very nice lady at the counter greeted me with the typical thai hello.  She engaged me in conversation while my food was cooking and she was very pleasant.  She explained the menu to me and that all the entrees come with rice.  I decided to try my default thai dish, Pad Thai.  I went with level 3 spicy.  I also order a Thai Tea and Green Tea Ice Cream.  while they cooked the Pad Thai she made the Thai Tea and let me tell you this was the BEST Thai Tea I have had!  It was just the right sweetness and not too bitter... We discussed the togo menus and I saw that they had coconut and green tea ice cream I asked her favorite and she recommended the green tea ice cream I ordered that as well.  The pad thai was ready within 10 minutes and I advised her of the tea and how delicious it was and I am sure I would be back.  Got home and ate almost half of the PAD THAI it was fantastic and believe me I have had some really good pad thai and this was great, the tofu was firm on the inside and crispy on the outside and the shrimp was perfectly cooked and not overly firm.  The flavor was not too spicy, it was just right.  I had the green tea ice cream for dessert and it was perfectly soft and creamy with a not too bitter taste and just the right sweetness.  I will go back to this place as it was really good!!  And the lady at the front counter, KUDOS for your service!!"}
{"text":"I like the tofu pad thai and crab puffs.  The chicken is good too.  It's fast and easy, and nice inside.   There is no bar like in Thai Elephant next door, but that makes it feel like a real take out place.   Worth checking out if in Tempe and craving Thai food.  It's closed on weekends, but stays open all day during the week,  no closings in mid afternoon here."}
{"text":"I ordered the yellow curry with chicken on my first visit and with tofu on my second visit.  So good!  Sauce was very creamy with a nice, spicy curry flavor that was offset by the sweet coconut milk.  (I didn't care for the big chunks of onion, but they were easy to pick out so it wasn't a big deal.)  The store has a stylish interior, very clean, with friendly staff.  I will definitely go here again, and I'm hoping to try out some more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a great lecture at ASU. Two Thai places, side by side, one is more of a sit down, dine in place and the other (where I went), more of a take away although we did eat there.  Rather small menu with the usual fare of Thai food. Ordered the Pad Thai and Red Curry.  Sat outside in the evening sunset which was pleasant and discussed the lecture. Food came in short order. Portions were fair sized. I ordered spice/hot 4 or possible 5, but it was still rather tame. Pad Thai was OK to good, it lacked fresh basil which can make the dish. It had chicken and chucks of tofu which was a bit odd, but I have come to find that this dish is kind of a Thai chop suey, whatever a place has, they seem to add to the dish. About the only universal is the sauce and the rice noodles. A hard dish to compare to itself as the target constantly changes depending on where you order the dish. My problem is that I tend to compare all Thai food to that which I had in Thailand and few come close to that, so the scale has to be modified. Anyway, I would go back to this place in a pinch if I wanted Thai food and was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fairly average Thai.  The location is great and the service is very fast.  Its a cute location with a nice outside dining area as well.    I felt that the dishes were fresh, but very bland.  I tried a couple different dishes but all tasted very similar.  The portion size was generous for the price however.  I wouldn't not go back to 5 RCha Thai again, but if given the option would probably choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"Looked good but was unedible with red flake, not even Thai, peppers.  Ordered medium and I love spicy food but neither of us could eat our dishes.  Sis took me for dinner and is ordering pizza now.  Not fast.  Not good."}
{"text":"5 R Cha is a nice little Thai cafe that we hit every now and then. We're big Thai food connoisseurs, and this place passes the test.     The cafe is quaint, with a nice little patio in front. If you are familiar with the neighborhood it used to be Cafe Roma. The inside is nice and everything is clean.      The Thai Iced Tea is a trip! It is wonderful, and is in a giant margarita chalice...this thing is huge! The panang is great, with the spice just how you ask for it every time. My husband recently tried the beef boat noodles (I could be making that name up) and he thought it was flavorful and the meat tender.      When it comes to dessert, we will pass from now on. The rice they use in sticky rice isn't the white glutinous, but a coarse kao neow dam that I was not a huge fan of. Mango is in season, but the mango used was not ripe and was cut with some rind left on.      The service is always fast and friendly. I would recommend 5 R Cha for Thai food if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  so glad we gave it a try! I had the yellow curry with extra chicken and 5 stars. (5*  thai hot scale). I like my food very very spicy and it was perfect for me. The prices are very good, and the server's couldn't have been nicer.  The portion size was insane.  I had a complete meal of leftovers.  I was very impressed by the amount of chicken they gave me. My wife had a huge bowl of soup similar to pho, sorry I forgot the name. It had giant meatballs in it, she was very happy with it. She could only eat maybe a third of it, so she had leftovers as well. We will definitely be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Always hot and delicious. I get takeout from 5 RCha far more than I should. They're always willing to work with my requests, and they're always wonderful all of the time. Thanks for continuing to be my go to Thai place for over two years!"}
{"text":"This is the first Thai restaurant I've seen that looks like it's made to order food to go. All food is served in Styrofoam boxes if you order pad thai/pad see yew or any other noodle dish and the curries are served in a plastic box. I've tried the pad Thai, pad see yew, and yellow curry and the food is definitely pretty good for how quick they get the food out (about 5-10 minutes) although I still think Thai elephant which is next door is better. I'd recommend it for a quick order of Thai food!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I hope this place improves, I really really do. I love fresh thai and if they improved their quality/recipes, I'd eat there 5-times a week.   This is really bad. I'm not a food snob, but I can tell the differences between fresh food and overpriced reheated crap. I've ordered pad thai and drunken noodle on two separate occasions. The pad thai was totally bland, uninspired, unseasoned and lacking definitive flavor. The Drunken noodle was not stir fryed, as it appeared the noodles were taken from boiling water and some disgusting mystery sauce was poured over them. Thai elephant is not groundbreaking either, but at least their dishes have zest and flavor. Spices and what-have-you. If you want low quality noodles, no seasoning and mystery flavors, check this place out bring your own soy sauce and sriracha.   Recommended dishes: Get an egg roll. They are comically small and unreasonably expensive."}
{"text":"Okay so first off, the confusion, this place still has the 5 r chai sign up but it's now called Thai Elephant. The number isn't the right one on here either. They also got rid of the size options, so you can't get regular or large, only the large size. Kind of sucks if you're just trying to pick up some take out for yourself and don't just want noodles or something. I don't know, the service was off and like I said, the confusion put me off as well. I miss the 5 r chai from before :/"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place is right next to Thai Elephant and is owned by the same people.  5 RCha Thai is more of a To-Go type of place rather than a sit down.  They do have seating inside and out but still it is limited.  The reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how Thai Elephant handled an issue he had in their restaurant about 2 months ago, like I mentioned before Thai Elephant and 5 RCHa are owned by the same people.  The food was very good and the service was fast.  I ordered the Pad Thai Udon w/ chicken.  When I they brought me the food I was surprised to see the food being served to us in to go containers but that doesn't mater.  The Pad Thai was rich in flavor and was the perfect temperature.  I ordered a level 3 spice and needed to add 1 spoon of chili sauce to help kick up the heat that I was looking for.  I would have liked to see the food being served on a plate instead of a to-go container when you ask for dine-in.  The atmosphere was pleasant and quiet.  I was able to enjoy lunch with friends without having to talk over music or other people.  Since we went here for lunch I am not sure what it is like after work but we will be adding this to our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap Thai food. I like this place because the food is always solid, hot, fresh and flavorful mostly importantly....fast. My coworker put me on to this spot and we go at least lace a week. I always get the Dynamite fried rice, which is basically fried jasmine rice with veggies and basil...yummy! I can't say anything bad about this spot, and I will always come here when I need a Thai fix, and fast! I don't think they are open on the weekends, which suck because it limits my Thai options."}
{"text":"When I eat out I expect consistency.  I just had to bring back two plates of food because it was WAY to Thai Spicy.  I have eaten at alot of thai places and always get thai hot.  I have even had this before at the same place and today it is simply to hot to eat.  What I did not like is they tried to tell us we have never had their number 5 before  and we have.  It was close to their closing time and refused to remake the food only offering a refund.  Sorry you had to work late but if you mess up an order you should fix it.    This has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth for service, I won't go back.  The owner wanted to argue.  Customer is always right!"}
{"text":"If you want great thai food, for a low price and rapid service, then, THIS is the place to go! I think this place has better thai food than its sister restaurant, Thai Elephant (I believe the families are related, though the restaurants aren't necessarily connected).  The ginger pork is really good, as well as the cashew chicken. I especially love their drunken noodles. Their pad thai is a bit too sweet (for my taste). The dishes range from $5.95-6.95 for a regular size dish to $7.95-8.95 for a large sized dish.    This would be a great little restaurant to come on your lunch break!"}
