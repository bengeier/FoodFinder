{"text":"Been to many different Sushi all you can eat restaurants, i find this one the worst. I have been here a few times and the most recent time i have eaten there i got food poisoning. A good restaurant should never give a individual any kind of sickness."}
{"text":"My friends and I accidently stumbled into Bikkuri for lunch because Sushi D was closed (supposedly they only serve during dinner hours). Since we were feeling like hungry women, we decided to go for the $12 all you can eat lunch special they offered. The AYCE variety is a little short but there are some excellent options available. They have rolls such as dynamite maki, kamikazi maki, california rolls and various hand rolls. They also offer some appetizers like miso soup, salad, tempura veggies, gyoza, and some hot entrees like chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki. My favourites are the spicy salmon rolls (I really like their spicy mayo), the dragon makis and the SASHIMI! (salmon/white tuna - one of the freshest I've ever eaten. They're thickly cut and tasty). The sushi is well prepared and arrives looking professionally done. Service is quick and efficient - I appreciate the constant refill on the green tea. It's not a large place and it's pretty quiet. Pretty average but I actually surprisingly liked it."}
{"text":"Bikkuri is the best restaurant for take out. I've never been to the restaurant itself, so I can't comment on that.

But from my weekly ordering in, they're fast and efficient, the delivery man is always friendly, which makes it ordering from them not intimidating at all. Their food is always hot, which to me means that they make the food right when they get the order. The food is always delicious, I've fallen in love with their donkatsu don, or the chicken don. I always order that from them and a variation of sushi. They never skimp out on the meat in sushi, which is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Well I have to admit I've had better sushi and fresher seaweed salad before... and was it just me or was the tempura a bit tasteless? However for the price of $20 for AYCE at dinner, you really can't beat it. If you go for the meat dishes you won't be disappointed. The ribs were tasty and the teriyaki beef was great, too. Also, I was surprised to see sashimi on the menu - this is the first time I've ever seen it offered on an AYCE menu, AND it was fresh and amazing. The night we went it was really quiet (ie. we were the only table), so the service was efficient and the food came out quickly. A good place to come with friends."}
{"text":"$18.99 for AYCE? I have absolutely no problem paying $18.99 for AYCE sushi when the quality is there, but Bikkuri fell a little short on this one.

I'll start out by saying that this place is pretty clean and visually appealing. There's an abundance of booths and they can also accommodate large groups. I came here with a party of 10 and we were very comfortably seated in the restaurant. 

Now, onto the deal breaker: the food. The AYCE menu was pretty deep- so much so that it was almost very overwhelming. I do like a lot of choices, but not too many that I'm spending about 15 minutes trying to decide what I should get. Here's where they failed to deliver:
-The rolls were very loosely packed and kept falling apart 
-The rice was still a little too warm to be served on a cold piece of fish 
-They ran out of tuna and failed to say anything to us until we kept asking about our order of tuna sashimi
-The amount of avocado used to compensate for the very small amount of fish in a roll was massive (and mushy)
I did, however, enjoy the tai very much. It seemed to be the freshest of all the fish that we ordered that day.

The service here was alright. I have no complaints, but I don't have any major compliments either. 

Will I be back? Probably not on my own accord."}
{"text":"Relatively speaking, this was the worst AYCE sushi place I've ever tried. I went for lunch and had the AYCE. I understand that sashimi is expensive so it's reserved for dinner AYCE only. So it's fine that they don't offer it. In the downtown area, there are so many sushi places offering lunch specials between $6-9 dollars for non-AYCE options but many of them don't have \"raw fish\". Many lunch specials are just chicken teriyaki or bento boxes with california rolls (which contains no raw fish). I like those too but sometimes I crave for sashimi so lunch AYCE is what I do if I want some raw fish for lunch. 

What made it intolerable were the sushi. HUGE MASSIVE CHUNKS OF RICE with a scrawny piece of fish on top. The fish was so small it just falls right off if you pick it up with chopsticks. As if having a bad rice to fish ratio wasn't bad enough, the mackerel sushi tasted lukewarm. Either they left it out in the open for too long, or the fish was slightly rotten, or did they actually try to defrost it by heating it? I don't know but it tasted nasty. 

The initial order of sushi made me more full than intended thanks to the rice and my personality of insisting not to waste food. So I didn't get to try as much of the other dishes as I'd like. I recall I ordered salmon teriyaki and a few other meat items. Those are not easy to screw up and they tasted infinitely better than the sushi. 

The terrible sushi alone warrants a one star rating. There are so many sushi shops in the GTA and especially the downtown area that I can't overlook such a crippling flaw."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite AYCE sushi places around the beaches area! I come here regularly and felt I should write my opinion.
Although the AYCE menu is not quite as extensive as other sushi restaurants overall the selection of sushi, sashimi and other dishes is quite good. Sashimi is always fresh and generous cuts. I love their maki rolls especially the spider roll ( soft shell crab) which is hard to find in all you can eat sushi places. They're tempura is always fresh and their teriyaki chicken and beef dishes are also very tasty. they also have a good range of vegetarian options. Overall, there is good value for money here for the dinner AYCE and I would recommend them. Their lunch menu doesn't include sashimi which is a bit of a let down for me as it's one of my favourite dishes at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Bikkuri! The food is great, good portions and good price for AYCE, and pretty quick service. If you sit at the little dinner bar, you can watch the sushi chefs make the meals. Love the maki rolls, haven't tried one that I don't like yet, and the BBQ eel is to die for. They also have the dinner menu for those who prefer a single meal over all you can eat, there are dinner and lunch specials at a good price too.

The service is great but a little awkward, as they don't speak too much English, but they are so cute and SO nice and really care about your experience there.

All in all it's a nice restaurant in a cozy environment, with entertaining music, good service, and great food."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with this place but the rolls tend to be loose and thus sometimes a little hard to eat.  I don't enjoy their combo meals as much as other places like Oishi Katta close by at Augusta/College.  Well priced and good service for stay in and take out so I would say it's not  *bad* choice but not my first."}
{"text":"I have eaten better Japanese food and had sushi that tasted a teensy bit fresher.

That being said, the All-You-Can Eat lunch is $12.95.  It was quite good, especially for the price. I loved the spicy tuna roll, the California roll, and the Sesame Chicken was on point.  The all-you-can-eat menu features 150 items, including spring rolls and cooked items from the kitchen, as well as freshly prepare sushi and sashimi.  There is even ice cream (spelled Ice Cram on the menu) for dessert. A canned soft drink adds only a 1$ to your cost if you don't want water or traditional hot tea."}
{"text":"The AYCE was too much food for my tiny little stomachy so I ordered from the regular menu. Prices are normal, and I had a pleasant experience dining there after an afternoon bike ride. 

The sashimi was well cut, the green tea was tasty, as well as the miso soup. As others noted, the service is slow - there was only one girl serving three couples and only one very slow sushiman, so it took ages to have some sushi on my table. But they served the miso and salad pretty fast, and I could deal with that. 

It's not by any means an upscale place, so expect minimal d√©cor and style. I'd go there again, for sure, because it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Sukiyaki-Don was t.e.r.r.i.b.l.e. A ton of rice, very little meat and vegetables - the least they could have done was drench the rice with sukiyaki sauce...nope. The entire thing was dry and tasteless.  

The beef wrapped enoki mushroom tasted funkily bland.

Their spicy handrolls were good though, so maybe their all you can eat is worth it."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised that this random find was actually pretty good. The Black Dragon and Dynamite Rolls were awesome and super fresh. 

This lunch AYCE was pretty cheap at $8.99 but the service was painfully slow. Several items I checked off on my order sheet never made it to my table and some items I didn't order did. After the second order was placed the waitress stopped checking up on us and we had to get her in order to get our bill.

I'll probably do take out here next time."}
{"text":"Bikkuri gets 4 stars from me because you can get sashimi with the all-you-can-eat lunch! It is a limited amount, but that still beats almost every other AYCE sushi place around.

The fish is good for an all you can eat place, they have a good selection of rolls, and the price is right ($11 to $12 for lunch). I have found that some of the rolls don't always come with everything listed on the menu, though this might just have been because they were out of green onion...

The hot appetizers are generally well made, including very good chicken karage and surprisingly tasty cheese wontons.

As others have said, the service can be slow, but if you time your orders right, you can eat non-stop once the first dishes arrive! =P"}
{"text":"This is my favourite, favourite, favourite Japanese restaurant in the world.

Hit this place up around lunchtime. When it comes to the lunch specials, you can't go wrong. I always come for lunch, and I order the exact same thing every time: the Sushi Lunch. There's a selection of different rolls from which you can choose two. You get six of each along with miso soup, salad, and tea, all for $5.99. Cheap AND delicious, not to mention perfect if you're short on cash."}
{"text":"Having had this place on my radar since it opened a month or two ago, I finally slipped in for a taste. On a Sunday afternoon, it was fairly quiet with only a total of three tables filled, but this translated into extremely rapid service. My order (or at least half of it - more on this later) showed up in what seemed like a blink of an eye. I barely managed to look around and absorb the minimal decor of typical Japanese restaurant fare (red and black and a few pictures and lanterns). 

My tempura yam maki was tasty and gobbled up in 6 bites, and it took me five minutes of waiting around for the other roll i ordered to realize that they must have messed up my order. Although I was slightly annoyed, this was quickly rectified after talking with the waitress (who did apologize) and the crazy maki (spicy tuna w/ wasabi tobiko and avocado) was so delicious that it appeased any negative feelings I might have harbored. My bill for the two maki rolls came to $11.85. 

Before leaving, I made a visit to the washroom which was surprisingly clean and spacious but which had an unpleasant odor which vaguely reminded me of cat litter. It was while washing my hands and thinking that they should really invest in some air freshener that the mystery of this smell was decoded. Sitting on top of the soap dispenser was a large sac of mothballs - their choice of air freshener. Really? - what were they thinking!"}
{"text":"I walked into Bikkuri because the signs taped onto the window advertised it being one of the best, or published in some magazine or newspaper as a place to go and I was thoroughly disappointed. I thought the sushi/maki rolls was of a low quality and did not enjoy their food AT ALL. If you want some good sushi at a lower price, walk down a block and hit up Izakaya."}
