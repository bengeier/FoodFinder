{"text":"Had dinner there last night and everything was spectacular. The ambiance and architecture of the restaurant is super hip. Looking forward to sitting on the patio too. Our server Joy was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and helped us pair our drinks with the food we ordered. We had some oysters, the Avocado salad, Salmon and the Radio Milano pasta dish and it all tasted delicious. Their cocktail list is really inventive and yummy! This is definitely going to be the new hot spot in Arcadia!!! Can't wait to go back and try more of the food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. Indifferent on this place. Wasn't overly joyed by the menu. Nothing really stood out that I HAD to have. The ladies at the bar that gave us their spot said they weren't impressed my the menu either and left to go to Chelsea's Kitchen. We did order the crab dip that did taste very fresh. But it was kinda dry and the crackers they serve them with were so gross and crumbly. My friend said the oysters were lovely. The kettle dirty martini was only $12, so I was happy with the price but not happy it was SO watered down. We were wondering why it looked so full, then tasted it and it was definitely half water. The bartender was busy but friendly and the ambiance was cheery but the whole room seemed very dark. I guess no happy hour yet. We left and had dinner at LGO so we still all in the fam. I will go back to try the oysters and will ask for a better martini"}
{"text":"A very trendy and cool place to come with friends or with a date.   Pros: amazing selection of oysters. We love oysters and I'll honestly say these are extremely high quality and tasty. We tried all of the oysters that were available. I'll definitely try the crab claws and shrimp from the raw bar next visit.   Coffee and pistachio gelato were great.   Good selection of cocktails, wines, and bubbles. We have the Vouvrey brut and it was pretty good.   Ambience is great - awesome decor and interior and lighting. I personally like the fact that it is very dark inside - gives it more of a mysterious and romantic vibe.   Cons: the main dishes we tried were good but not great. We had the Brussels sprouts (pretty good with the goat cheese dip), the trout which was so-so, the crab cakes were ok (not worth the price), and the scallops were a little bit too charred so the burnt flavor took over.   Inside is very loud, especially toward the bar, so you have to speak loudly to hear anyone in your group. I am not a fan of this, but what can you expect when the restaurant is packed?  Overall a good place and we will definitely return for the raw bar items which were amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place! It was my first time at Buck & Rider and I was blown away by this restaurant and everyone who works here. The ambiance was great because it offered a more intimate setting with just the right amount of music to make it fun and upbeat. Management was extremely friendly and stopped by on several occasions to make sure we were enjoying our dining experience. Our server Gabriella was very knowledgeable as well, and couldn't have been nicer. We loved the drinks (I had the Your Money or Your Life and my girlfriend had the One Night in Babylon) which we both agreed were some of the better specialty cocktails that we have had in a long time. We started off with the crab and macadamia roll along with the crunchy shrimp roll which were both incredible but the best surprise of the night came when the steamed PEI mussels hit the table. YOU NEED TO ORDER THESE. They are honestly so good that I am worried my description of them will not do them justice so please just trust me and order them. For the main course I had the 8oz grass fed filet which was perfectly tender as well as the grilled salmon which was cooked to perfection. To top it off we had the lemon meringue pie and just like the mussels I am insisting that you order this when you go. Will definitely be back very soon, thank you for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Adrianna was so friendly attentive and genuine.  Each dish was amazing; from appetizer to dessert.  Each person we came in contact with was the epitome of professionalism.  The ambiance is comfortable clean and warm.  Christian the bartender knocked our socks off with his frothy amaretto sours. They were the best I've ever had.  10/10! Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"So far that $250 dinner is costing me $1250 plus six days without a car. Their valet parked my car. Their cook backed into my car. I'm assuming he doesn't have car insurance since he has not provided me with his insurance info AFTER TWO WEEKS. The repair estimate is $1000. Manager says they'll pay. Corporate says not so fast. So it looks like I may be paying for this. The food was okay but I'm staying away from this joint!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Tuna tostadas were one of my favorites! To top it off, service was excellent! Would def recommend."}
{"text":"Our first trip was with a group of 10 or so, and we had a couple of issues.  We called in a the next day to check over our bill and ask about a couple of inaccuracies.  The manager we spoke with and the GM went above and beyond to fix our issues and insure we had a good experience the next time we stopped in, which we definitely appreciated.  Buck & Rider has some of the best fresh seafood selection in the Valley, with a variety of raw oyster options, fantastic lobster and shrimp, and an interesting craft cocktail menu. The Buck and Rider and Your Money or Your Life (if you are a whiskey fan) are strong favorites. The fried chicken is also amazing, we ordered a second basket because we loved it so much.  We also are a fan because B&R has one of the better post-work happy hour deals going. Historically, Geisha has been a standard for our group of friends because their HH lasts until 7 for those of us that work longer days, and because they have both food AND drink specials in a fun and trendy environment.  Well, Buck & Rider can boast the same or better!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took my wife, and some friends, for her birthday not too long ago. Our first impressions were mixed from person to person. Some thought it was ok, others weren't that impressed, but overall none of us were crazy about it. The overall vibe of the place is that it's confused. That goes for the menu and decor. The service was ok, but not great. We had about a 35 minute wait, which we used to check out the bar. We were fortunate enough to grab seats, which was nice, but the bartender, a \"gentleman\", was not in a friendly mood at all. The bar was slammed, so he might have been overwhelmed, but his service was below par to put it nicely. Our server at our table though was much better and friendlier. She was well informed and checked on us often. Overall the food was ok, nothing special. Moving forward we'll probably only visit this place for happy hour."}
{"text":"The salmon is the best salmon I have EVER eaten.  It is spicy, incredibly juicy, it falls apart!  It has green beans ,faro, and is spicy in a very interesting way!  I ate very single bite.  It isn't cheap, but worth every penny.  The lemonade was \"out of this world\".  Frothy, not too sweet.  Never had fresh  lemonade this good, either.  I went later in the evening, so parking was not a problem.  Dress casual, or even workout clothes, or stilettos, it all works here!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Atlanta for a meeting, with two companions from Ft Lauderdale and Toronto. The food was great as was the staff. When we weren't happy with the wine, they brought us another bottle which turned out to be just what we wanted. The crab cakes- delicious! No filler, just crab and a crusty topping. Excellent!!  The ambiance is great as well.  All in all, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place but it let me down.  Small dishes for high prices and nothing I tasted wowed me.  Drinks are pricy too and nothing impressive.  In one word \"ehh.\""}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here about 4 times every time taste great! We always have oysters, ceviche, shrimp cocktail, steak,  the salmon is bomb! And key lime pie is home made! Buuuuuut I wish they would bring back the banana cream pie!!!!! That was the best!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. From the decor and ambiance to the delicious food and amazing service, we had such a great time here. The food really was amazing. They really went above and beyond to make our dining experience phenomenal."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding as always!  Elizabeth was a fantastic server, great personality, super helpful and always on point.  Andre has to be one of the best leaders to work with.  Brought in our own version of a \"VIP\" and he made her first experience, extra special.  Can't beat the HH prices or the service or the friendliest.  If its not on your top 5, go until it is!  Won't take long."}
{"text":"Didn't love it.  Service was great and the ambiance was really nice; although perhaps a bit too dark and a little hard to hear folks on the opposite end of the table.    The menu was meh.  Ordered several appetizers: calamari tasted burnt, chicken strips were dry, salad options were unique, but not amazing.   I did enjoy the Brussel sprouts - very tasty.  Sushi was also not very tasty.  And portion sizes were fairly small for the pricing.    Not sure I'll be back for a second run."}
{"text":"Being from the Pacific Northwest, I am very picky about my seafood. Other than the sound of crashing waves, it is what I miss the most. Last Thursday, my daughter and I had the most delicious meal at Buck and Rider. Their Happy Hour drink specials are what drew us in, but the food made us stay. The spicy tuna tostadas had the right about of heat. The brussel sprouts were like nothing I ever tasted before. The shrimp skewers rivaled anything I ever had on the sandy beaches of Rocky Point. And Gabi, our server, was both hard working and gracious and truly defined hospitality. And the sunset over Camelback mountain was perfection and made our evening. Thanks for a wonderful evening!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of Buck & Rider is on point. The Baked Yuzu Roll, Avocado roll and the shrimp skewers were very much enjoyable as well. The raw bar selection is also very vast for this area, as well as delicious. Sitting at the bar sets a great glimpse of the entirety of the restaurant, the view of Camelback isn't half bad either. Would definitely revisit this restaurant not only for the food but from the hospitality I received from the bartenders. Good vibes."}
{"text":"Wonderful happy hour and fresh seafood!! Highly recommend....but get there early as it fills up quick!"}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix for a while after my husband had an accident and was airlifted here.  Lauren and Jonathan were so kind to my mom and I, as they understood what we were going through.  I loved the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, but mostly I loved the service.  They went above and beyond and I can't express my gratitude enough.  Kudos to our very knowledgeable bartender with a pretty smile Lauren and to Jonathan who was so sweet to us.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I live down the street and was very excited to try the new LGO concept, the atmosphere was fantastic, the service great, the wait staff was awesome and explained everything.  My only problem was I needed to tap into my 401k to pay  for 3 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine! $75 later I am stopping by Filabertos to fill up. I should have just gone to the Salty Sow."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The service was outstanding and the food was great. The salmon was delicious, fresh and tender. All the seafood apps were great. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Another great dinner with my Wonderful Husband at one of my Favorite Restaurants! B&R never lets me down! Great service! Great Food! I love that they added Fresh Lobster too. I really like the atmosphere, classy and upscale but not stuffy. They are always so friendly!  Thank you for having such a incredible establishment :) Love it."}
{"text":"What a gem!! I went during restaurant week and was so delighted.  The service was wonderful, the drinks were perfect and my oysters, halibut and grilled veggies were to die for!  I'm telling everyone I can- \"Go!!\""}
{"text":"Sooooo gooood! Loved the variety of fresh oysters and house specialty drinks!"}
{"text":"great attention, love the food. everyone is super nice. has a really classic style I personal love that.  the music, the light invite me to enjoy more and more.   I totally recommend buck & rider"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I absolutely loved their \"carving station\"/\"Host(ess) station, very different. I feel like this place is very different from a lot of restaurants that are here (structure, placement, etc.), and gives an awesome cool, casual, edgy vibe. I can whole heartedly say that I will be coming back on a regular basis. Everything tasted SO fresh and clean. Nothing was too over powered by the sides or sauces, you were able to actually thoroughly enjoy and   taste the difference compared to most fish places who say they are \"fresh\" but you can clearly taste a gross fishy taste. Also I have to give them probs to their drink names, \"Hit the road Jack\" was so refreshing and besides I enjoyed ordering each drink because of the fun creative name! Must try, phoenix. B&R won't let you down. ALSO THEIR MERINGUE PIE IS DELICIOUS to end the night."}
{"text":"Great food & excellent service. The shrimp and chorizo screws are incredible. If you like fresh oysters, you will be happy with the selection!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene! Fresh seafood is SO hard to come by in AZ and after moving back from San Fran a couple of months ago, this is exactly what I needed on a rainy Sunday evening.   We ordered a bottle of wine with a dozen oysters, a few from each of their selection. The oysters were followed by the steam PEI mussels which were out of this world. Wonderful pepper and rosemary flavors with chopped garlic... I'm still drooling over these!! And served with their house cornbread... Ugh! We also ordered the tuna tostadas and the beef tartar. They give you a MASSIVE serving of tartar with an egg yolk to top it off. The tostadas were fantastic, not too spicy and the pickled jalapeño, carrot combination was a great addition to the ahi and avocado combination. I could have eaten all three and been completely satisfied. We didn't have enough room to order anymore food, but will be back to explore more!  The only hiccups to our meal were the oysters, I had a lot of shell particles in each of the four that I ate. Shucking isn't easy and it is a new restaurant, so I can't fault anyone. Also, our bottle of wine was delivered and already open. I'm not a stickler for abiding by all of the formal dining \"rules\", but that one may be better left as is, just for the peace of mind of the guest. Still a great meal and left satisfied! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food is good -- but pricy.  Chelsea's Kitchen is way better and a lot more comfortable...go there, it's just around the corner.  The chairs in the bar are super annoyingly loud. As I told a friend I went there, he said, \"yea, the chairs in the bar are terrible!\" Obnoxiously loud and so heavy for no reason.  1st time there I sat at the bar for dinner.  Nice bar tenders and very attentive.  2nd time there is when was for HH with 3 friends. We were waiting on the last 2 to arrive and ordered a bottle of wine in advance. Our server came to our table 4 times to take an order ---again, we're waiting on 2 more.  She offered to bring us bread but told us, \"there's a charge...so I don't know if you would want it??...\"  Totally awkward.  We ordered it anyway. Soon as our friends arrived, another server took over our table and asked if we wanted to order before the other two even had a glass of wine poured.---We felt rushed.  As we drank and ate, the server continuously came to our table, interrupting our conversation to ask if we wanted to order more...it was annoying; we had ordered 2 bottles of wine and 4 appetizers and bread...and all the while someone else was walking through the bar with a tablet on their wrist 'inventorying' the tables... It was so uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"We went for brunch for the first time.  We both had Buck & Rider Eggs Benedict.  It was excellent - just the right amount of spiciness and a perfect béarnaise sauce.  Our waitress let the French Press coffee sit for a few minutes and it was perfect.  A couple of salty chocolate chip cookies on the way to the parking lot.  In short we loved it!"}
{"text":"So excited that I finally got a chance to try this place! We stopped in one night expecting to have to wait for a table but were seated immediately. Our server came over right away and explained the raw bar to us. We passed on the oysters but started with the lobster nik niks which were the perfect size for sharing. We also tried the shrimp skewers which had a little kick to them but were definitely one of our favorite parts of the meal. When it was time for dinner, our server suggested the miso marinated salmon and after hearing her describe it, I couldn't say no! We finished the meal with the chocolate cake and pistachio gelato. So, so rich, and so, so good. I was so impressed by how fast, but thorough the service was. I never felt like I had to wait for anything or like any of my questions would go unanswered. Who knew fresh seafood could be available in Phoenix?! My new favorite place and I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here with another couple last night for the first time.  As always you expect a good experience at an LGO concept and we got it.  We started out with crispy hash browns as an appetizer and it was well done with the sauce provided.  Entrees by our friends were the redfish and crab cakes.  My wife and shared the crab cakes and the scallops.  To be honest these two items never seem to have a great flavor but both entrees we shared we were well prepared and had some zip as a result of a sauce on the crab cakes and a seasoning on the scallops.  Friends were pleased with their's as well.  The lemon meringue pie was extraordinary.  Only two complaints.  First the waitress seemed overwhelmed and struggled to be timely with our requests.  Secondly, it was a windy dusty day in Phoenix but we sat on the patio anyway.  The glass table countertops should have been wiped off and you could literally write your name in the dust on the table top.  Very disappointing.  Had the all around attention to service been better this would have been a easy four."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a handful times now. The service is always awesome. I like the outside bar during the color months.  I love the Brussels sprouts and the half lobster on happy hour for $12 - cold or warm!  The desserts are hands down the highlight. You can't go wrong. The lemon meringue is the best, but the chocolate cake is amazing as well! Don't forget the LGO Cookies on the way out.   From a service standpoint, the managers are always attentive and friendly. Dama behind the bar is awesome; she used to be at Ingo's and has always been great. I always ask for Sophie to be my server, she seems very happy to be there and always recommends the best food!    Highly recommend over a lot of places in the area, better service than a lot of the newer restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I came here before and wasn't too impressed until we can back again last night... I found another favorite restaurant! Everything was so delicious! Sushi was so clever and light! I've never had mussels cooked to that level! They were so tender and the sauce was on point!! I am also obsessed with Hit the Road Jack! I think I drank 7 glasses!! Can't wait to return again!!!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch there and it was great! I've been several times before for happy hour and dinner and now for lunch. I was surprised how busy they were but still maintained great speed and service. I ordered the fish and chips and my friend had the Brussel sprouts and some oysters and it was all delicious! Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"First of all, we love this area! Next, the food was refreshingly good!  We ordered a nice bottle of Turnbull Cabernet Sauvignon,  assorted raw oysters with mignonette which were really, really good!!! We also ordered the lobster roll nik niks which was good as well (although flavor of the \"sauce\" overpowered the lobster flavor). For our entree we ordered Pan Fried Loup de Mers (absolutely good and refreshing) and Pan seared scallops was cooked perfectly.  Besides all these yummy food, our server Nicole B. was extremely knowledgeable and helpful!  I have already told a lot of my friends about this place! Thank you and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Dropped in with the parents and shared some appetizers.   It's improved a lot from my last visit. The rolls alone are worth the trip. Also got ceviche, brussel sprouts, and fried calamari. All were excellent!!!  The chef even stopped by our table to check on how we enjoyed the food. Drinks were on point as well. Will definitely return to check out more of the menu. Kudos buck and rider."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out that LGO Hospitality would be opening a new restaurant this fall. Finally there is another option for great food, open later, and in the Arcadia area. As with their other restaurants, Buck & Rider doesn't disappoint. Fish flown in daily? Yes please! You can tell how fresh the seafood is. I loved the Sushi and the Halibut. Second time I visited, I tried the calamari and the NY Strip. Both were excellent. Next time I am trying the Seafood Bar. Oh, and the restaurant itself is gorgeous."}
{"text":"It is said that life is short, eat dessert first. I may do that next time I go to B&R. I have found the world's best lemon meringue pie there . The meringue and lemon are amazing and made with fresh real ingredients-nothing artificial. But, the crust...ohhh the crust!! I will surely be making late night runs for it.   On my first visit, I just wanted to try some of the unique sushi choices. I have been to some of the best sushi bars in Tokyo and Osaka. The sushi was beautifully presented and amazing to the taste. The sushi will also be on my late night runs back to B&R.   One more thing to make this wonderful new restaurant a unique treat. The energy and authenticity that Laura and Kate bring to B&R adds to the full experience.  As Arnold said, I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"First off, Buck & Rider has excellent service and an amazing menu. Before the experience I'm about to detail, I had only been one time for Happy Hour - and I was even impressed by that. My parents came to visit from Missouri and on the first night in town, my father suggested steak and my mother, per usual, requested some place that would have a nice steak for him and a great fish dish for her. Once we arrived, we had a short wait so we sat in the bar area and ordered a beverage. Once our table was ready, we were greeted with friendly service and ordered the calamari to start with (so good!).   Once our entrees arrived, we all started to dig in. Unfortunately, my boyfriend's steak was overdone. Now, I was a waitress in a steakhouse for several years so I made sure that the steak was out of \"okay\" range before sending it back. It was a busy night, and he is far from picky about his food, and the steak was expensive, so he sent it back for another. From then on, we were wowed.    The server was friendly and apologetic, while the rest of us continued to eat. (I shared my scallops with him while he waited, don't worry!) In the mean time, the manager visited our table, offered complimentary drinks and took care of the tab. He offered dessert (too full at that point) and invited us to come back with some bounce back coupons. We eat out frequently, and we are pretty easy-going. We never expressed a hint of anger or frustration about the steak situation: it happens; it's a risk you run when you order steak at a restaurant. However, the entire staff at B&R made the experience a million times better. We will definitely be returning, and I will recommend the place to everyone I meet. Amazing service, amazing food & cocktails. Don't forget a cookie on the way out!"}
{"text":"Big fan of LGO restaurants. So ready for their seafood menu. Disappointed! Very crowded and noisy but found a two top in the bar. No Pino Grigio for the lady. Didn't carry my beer. Sample they brought was not good. Ordered oysters from the \"fresh seafood\" chalkboard. They were out. (This was around 7:30 on a friday night).  Ordered a crab salad. They were out. We had ordered two glasses of prosecco so we finished them and left."}
{"text":"Absolutely will go back!.  Our server, Errin(sp) was fantastic!  Jumbo shrimp were amazing, tuna tostada delish, little lobster sandwiches really good!  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Simply the best and freshest seafood in Phoenix and at happy hour so amazingly well priced. Don't need to go anywhere else for amazing oysters, lobster, king crab legs, calamari, shrimp and anything else. The steak tartare is incredible and so are the steaks. They have original craft cocktails and SUPER friendly service. I'm in love. I have had a few cocktails, dozen oysters, half a Maine lobster and king crab legs for under $70 at happy hour. Plus the desserts are amazing especially the Banana Creme Pie. Heading there now!"}
{"text":"This is such a nice dinner place. Everyone was friendly. All the servers worked as a team to make everything work. It was clearly a busy night for them and it being so new, they definitely had everything under control. Food was great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went to Buck & Rider last night (Friday) with my daughter and her friend to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  She wanted to try this restaurant.  Got seated right away.  The noise level was incredibly high - high enough so that you had a difficult time communicating with your server as well as with your dinner partners.  Had to shout to be heard above the loud music playing.  As everybody else was shouting over the music you can imagine how it sounded.  The wait staff was efficient for the most part.  Very friendly people.  Had the dinner rolls for an appetizer - they were great.  In our group of 4, I ordered the pan fried sea bass; my wife ordered grilled diver scallops; my daughter had the salmon and her friend ordered a small filet steak.  The salmon came you very good.  The steak was very small and rather plainly presented, but came with a sauce that was excellent.  My sea bass came out not looking like sea bass at all - it was two flat fillets of fish that were breaded and fried just like the menu said.  However, any other sea bass I've ever had has been larger, fluffier pieces.  There was no distinctive flavor - I could have been eating tilapia for that matter.  My wife's dinner was delivered in error - they brought her a salmon rather than the scallops she ordered.  They took that away and it took 15 minutes for them to return with the scallops - after the rest of us were almost done eating.  Her new order should have taken #1 priority in the kitchen.  Scallops only take 5-7 minutes to cook properly.  Instead her reorder was just mixed in with all the other orders and took too much time.  You could also tell that by the fact that they also brought her another loaded baked potato with the scallops.  That said, however, she said they were good.  By the way - the sides are great.  The loaded baked potato is a meal in itself.  Our bill for 4 entrees, 1 appetizer and a bottle of wine was just under $200 - $240 with a 20% tip. Plus a $5 tip for the almost mandatory valet parking.  For that kind of money, I expect a finer dining experience.  With our uneven experience, and especially the extreme noise, I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"The ambiance at Buck & Rider is warm and transcending.  Sat at the bar, where Brandon and Travis took very good care of us, and enjoyed a well made Nagroni while deciding which direction to take our dining experience.  After deciding to try some oysters and then move on to a couple of other treats to share we agreed on a bottle of Bouzeron Aligote.  The menu, both food and wine, are manageable to sort through and at the same time offer many delicious eclectic options.  A food and wine lovers paradise.   Bottle pricing is so attractive we were quickly discussing what we wanted to have next time we visit!  First Course:  Oysters - Sister Point, WA, Kusshi, BC and Gold Creek, WA  Fresh and delicious!  Second Course: Trout Salad - absolutely perfect.  We couldn't give it up when the next course came out and ate every bite.   Next:  Scallops and Brussel Sprouts.  Brussel sprouts are amazing.  I have always loved them but this preparation was truly unique to any other I have had.  Scallops were cooked perfectly.  My husband and I shared all, it was a great experience and more than enough food.  We are tough critics (would say 4 1/2 stars because perfection comes over time but...)  and left thrilled that we had a new restaurant to add to our very short list of places to return to as well as confidently recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! The seafood was really fresh. Ordered the gulf shrimp and oysters and they were amongst the best I've ever had. Also ordered the crispy hash browns and they were perfection! Service was very attentive and the presentation was beautiful. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are the biggest foodies.  I took her to Buck and Rider 2 weeks ago and ever since she had been begging me to take her back.  She is in love with their oyster! We got two dozen and the kinds of oysters they have are always good. So be creative and try many kinds as you can.  Next we tried the lobster Nick Nicks and those things are so delicious. They have a generous portion of lobster and those French fries that come with it are to die for. Then we had the steak and lobster. It was one of the best dinners I've had in Phoenix! Not to mention Jess our server was so kind , and polite. We never needed anything because she had already thought about it before we even thought about it . Amazing service and amazing food !"}
{"text":"The ambiance inside is great!! We decided to sit inside because of traffic. The oysters are amazing!! We also had the crispy calamari also very good. For our entrees we had the trout and crab cakes. The trout is amazing a must have! The actual crab cake is perfect but the sauce paired with the crab cake we did not like. The dessert we had was the 3 layer chocolate cake very rich pairs wells with the gelato!! Service is excellent and very attentive! Overall a must place to go in Arcadia:)"}
{"text":"Had a delightful lunch. The atmosphere is very charming. Brussel sprouts app are SO good! Unique sushi rolls. Had salads for our entrees and they were super fresh, flavorful, and eclectic. Very beautiful presentation! Our server was super sweet and gave us some really great recommendations for every single course. Those suspenders are so cute :) Plus we snagged some of their complimentary sea salt cookies on the way out."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, although pricy for what it was (a fish version of Chelsea's kitchen. What was really disconcerting though was the speed of light pacing. We sat down for a relaxing dinner at 5:40. We had wine, then oysters, salads, and the main course. We were done at 630p. No matter how much I tried to slow it down, as soon on one course finished, the other was IMMEDIATELY on the table. I understand the need for profitability etc, but when spending $150 on a meal, I would like some time for socialization. Don't take a first date here unless you have plans right after!! I probably won't be back. Disappointing, since I am such a big fan of the other LGO restaurants."}
{"text":"Blown away by Chef Wiener again.  My wife and I went out for our anniversary last night.  I heard that Chef W. had moved from Top of the Rock to Buck & Rider.  We'd enjoyed our last two anniversaries at TOR and were always impressed so we figured we'd try his new place.  We showed up and were immediately seated.  The place was buzzing, but not full-blown full...yet.  Our server, Shea, greeted us immediately.  Well, she was our main server, we were helped by no fewer than 6 separate people.  Their service was perfect, in my opinion.  They worked as a team but didn't \"over-serve\".  Shea was very engaging and helpful.  She spent considerable time explaining each treat that came out.  Our typical MO at places like this is to request a \"Chef's Choice\" dinner.  Not only does it give the chef a chance to show off, but we're invariably going to be treated to the items they're most proud of...it's going to be good.  Sure, you'll have favorites, and least favorites, but each item that shows up is going to be unique.  We never knew what was going to show up next.  Course after course, of \"off-the-menu\" items kept rolling in.  I wish I could remember the progression, or even every dish.  But we had oysters, hush puppies, a trout dish, some \"fried rice\" that also had quinoa in it, scallop civiche, a piece of tender swordfish with a crisp crust, crab cakes, a massive ribeye and some of the best lemon meringue pie I think I've ever had.  That meringue was so light and fluffy.  Anyway, a good hour and a half later we were stuffed!  I wanted to take a nap I was so content.  But unfortunately that behavior is frowned upon, so we took our leave.  By the time we were walking out we noticed that the place was PACKED!  There were a lot of people there but it never felt \"crowded\".  The dining room has a great flow to it, especially when the patio is open.  We got the bill and I was pleasantly surprised.  You'd think that an 8-course, chef's choice tasting dinner would break the bank.  I mean, it's an anniversary so you're supposed to splurge, whatever that means to you.  For us, we like to treat ourselves by visiting places where we know that the chef and his/her team are excited to be cooking for guests.  Yea, I love me some delivery pizza now and then, but I have no illusion that the person that made that pizza is as passionate about a dining experience as much as a professional, chef-lead kitchen.  This dining experience was WAY more valuable than the bill would have suggested.  In our opinion, this place is truly one of the most appealing dining experiences in the Valley."}
{"text":"Joella was our server tonight and she was so absolutely amazing. Her service met her eloquence in a way we all totally appreciated! The food and drinks were excellent but I would definitely suggest you recommend Joella as your server!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - I love the bar area and can't wait to try out the patio! The one complaint I have about the decor is the cheesy pictures on the back wall - they don't seem to go with the rest of the decor. Food and cocktails were great - halibut was perfectly seared and the dinner rolls were AH-MAZING. Can't wait until they open for brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Probably the greatest happy hour in existence but I would come here even if it wasn't happy hour. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and when my 10 month old threw his toys while I ate they helpfully picked them up. The music and ambiance was prefect for a lunch date with my baby.  For eats I had the happy hour White Fish Ceviche and the spicy salmon roll and usually when I order happy hour food I expect to get less food but here I am stuffed. The food is absolutely amazing. Thanks Buck and Rider. I need a nap."}
{"text":"Food awesome, atmosphere terrific! We sat at the bar, thought the bartender could have been more attentive. There were a few of us (not in the same party) that had to flag some one down for a refill."}
{"text":"Great deals, great raw bar, nice environment. Brunch, happy hour or dinner. Solid in all aspects"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing HH for the raw bar. Freshest oysters in the valley with the most variety to boot! Love trying all the different kinds and pretending to be able to tell the difference. The Kaipara is my favorite! The vibe is super fun but it can get a little loud. The service is top notch too!"}
{"text":"The lack of gluten-free options was very disappointing. I was surprised to find that none of their sushi is gluten-free! On the other hand, the crab cakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and I came in late on a Friday night approximately 1hr prior to closing. Our waitress Sarah was behind amazing! She made it feel as if we had hours until they closed,and whatever decision either it be food or drinks wouldn't be an issue. Put it this way Sarah would be the reason we would come back. Her amazing friendliness, attitude, and professional was leaps and bounds better than any service we've ever received. Thank you Sarah hope to see you soon."}
{"text":"First, the food was wonderful. This was our second visit and the food has been great both times. The first time our service was good, not exceptional, but good. This past time, our service was downright horrible. When we were initially seated the server came by immediately to take our order before we even looked at the menu and then stopped by two more times in the next 5 minutes. We hadn't even set our menus down yet. Then he didn't come back forever and check-ins were nonexistent. They dropped off our seafood from the raw bar, but we couldn't get anyone's attention to bring us plates for almost 10 minutes while it sat there. When they finally did bring plates, they were scorching hot. Not ideal for cold, raw seafood. We asked for cold (or at least room temp) replacements and we were brought slightly less hot plates. We asked for a number of side items and condiments that were never brought. All in all the service was a zero and the food was a four, so here is my two star review. This place has all the right ingredients to be a great spot, but they've got to get their service in order."}
{"text":"Didn't really care for the food the price or the service in this new restaurant I'm sorry to say"}
{"text":"We LOVE Buck & Rider! Food is fantastic and super fresh. What really keeps us coming back is the staff, especially GM Laura. She always makes us feel at home!"}
{"text":"What appears to be a mirage in the desert is actually an Oasis in the middle of the busy business Phoenix neighborhood, Arcadia. Buck & Rider home to Abys Oyster Bar is serving up fresh sea food paired with farm to table ingredients, however not completely sea food yet not American there's something for everyone to enjoy even sushi. As I walked up to the front door I could see the patio which looked like a Hollywood set for a fancy Manhattan restaurant, the open kitchen fills the inside with incredible aromas. The inside of Buck & Rider is just as impressive as the outside again decorated very elegantly, with art on the walls including an original Andy Warhol screen print. This was my first time eating at this location, I went in early afternoon for lunch on a Monday and there was no wait time. The service was fast as I walked in the host greeted me and said I can sit anywhere I wanted, this is a very popular dinner spot so there was maybe ten people in the entire restaurant during my visit.  I sat at the bar next to the fresh oysters and open kitchen; my waitress was very nice and had an answer to all my beer questions. This restaurant does have a reputation for being pricey and for a college student this might not be the most cost effective. However the happy hour menu had multiple options and all oysters are half off, there are also multiple drink specials during happy hour. I recently limited my diet so I am not eating red meat or chicken, which was not a problem there was three vegetarian options. I asked the waitress for her opinion on the menu as I do at every restaurant I visit so I can get an idea of what I should order. I was recommended the chicken sandwich on the happy hour menu, or the fish sandwich also a favorite of the staff. I did take a risk and order something completely new I saw on the menu, the Tuna Burger caught my eye and I choose the fresh greens for my side. I was told the greens are brought in regularly so they are not always the same, but they are always fresh.  My food did not take very long I should say no longer than expected, once again I had no wait time or delay my entire experience. My dish was served on a large white plate with basic plating; nothing fancy for the lunch order maybe for dinner they step up the plating. My fresh greens for that day where grilled broccoli with pine nuts over a turnip puree, and my burger was topped with a house aioli sauce and sliced avocados. The tuna patty was as crispy as any fried chicken breast I have ordered; the texture inside the patty was similar to a medium cooked burger. Everything blended well the turnip puree was paired nicely with chard broccoli and the pine nuts added to the texture making sure the greens didn't taste like baby food.  Over all I had a great experience I was expecting to spend more money here, however my total bill was $26.00. I was there during happy hour so my beer was $6.00, which is the average price for a craft beer now days, and my burger and side were $15.00. I would recommend this restaurant if you are going out to celebrate, on a date, a business meeting, or lunch on your own I would not recommend this location for a family with children.  Thank you, G. 4\5 will need to taste more for that 5/5 Count: 600"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Delicious food,fresh seafood,  service was superb. Great place for every age.We absolutely loved it.Highly recommend to try it."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a great seafood restaurant in Arcadia!  We have been for dinner, and went back for happy hour!  The oysters are fresh and the selection is good.  I ate the Salmon for dinner and it was cooked perfectly.  We also had the crab dip which is delish...but I don't love the crackers they serve with it.  The staff was friendly and seemed excited to be doing their job!  Overall, I think this is a great restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is good, the drinks are great, and the service is impeccable... One of the managers, Jonathan, is extremely nice, and always remembers me when I go in and makes it a point to come say hi and shake my hand. I only sit at the bar, and the bar tenders are amazing, especially Annie! Their happy hour is perfect and includes food and some of the specialty cocktails, and you definitely can't beat Sunday brunch and bottomless mimosas -- you can even stick around until it turns into Sushi Sunday with half price sushi! Definitely recommend this place even if you are not a seafood lover. The name is weird but it actually has meaning that goes with the type of restaurant, and the atmosphere is very nice and welcoming. I would probably describe it as upscale casual if talking to friends. Go on in and get drinks from Annie, I'll probably already be at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Gabriella was AMAZING and told the best jokes! Food was excellent and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"After only one visit, I'm impressed enough to give Buck & Rider 5 stars.   Our dinner was delicious!   We started with crispy calamari (love the jalapenos in there) and a sushi roll with crab and macadamias. The rolls were bit bigger than bite sized (actually had to cut mine down) but flavors were great. Our entrees all lived up to their menu descriptions for flavor and freshness. Not sure I have the words to properly describe this intensely decadent chocolate cake we shared for dessert.   Service was very attentive. Pretty sure our server was training but she did pretty well with making recommendations from the menu. Atmosphere is very lively but casual.  Really liked their cocktail menu, but my one suggestion is that they add some Arizona beers and wines to their bar menu.   The sum total of our dining experience means we will be back for more."}
{"text":"NYE perfect location.  Great food Excellent service from Valerie.  Best Alaska King Crab legs in all of Phoenix too!  Yes we WORSHIP THE CAMEL and the Tequila Sunrise.  We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I really like the service here, everyone is knowledgable and attentive. My scallops were great as were our oysters, the sea bass was surprisingly bland. That and wishing happy hour was in the entire restaurant would be my only complaints I will definitely be back for more buck and rider oysters!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 11-7pm. Half price on food and $6 drink specials. Can anyone really complain about that?! The bartender recommended a night in Babylon. If you like savory, cucumber refreshing, gin and a bit of spice. This is the place for you. With 6 different types of raw oysters and a cooked oyster appetizer. -1 star for oysters still a bit pricey even at happy hour prices."}
{"text":"We went to Buck &Rider excited to find a new seafood place in the area, but were disappointed to find out that they don't take reservations. We still wanted to try it out, and we decided to wait for a table. After being seated we found out they don't offer food on their happy hour, just drinks. So we ordered a few things off of the regular menu to try out.   We started with oysters and the cornbread. The oysters were great, fresh, clean, and tasted very nice. I would definitely get oysters here again. The cornbread was also amazing. We really enjoyed it. We had high expectations after these appetizers and decided to order the lobster rolls and the trout to share. This is were our excitement died. The lobster rolls had stale bread and were fishy as well as being doused in mayo. I don't think someone could pay me to eat these again. As well, the trout was in a very heavy crust, ruining the flavor of the trout. I would not get this again either. What made these meals more disappointing was the fact that their prices are extremely high. This would be fine if it was amazing, but it wasn't and that's a problem.   This place seems really good for oysters and drinks, but I would not come here for a full dinner. Too many better options nearby."}
{"text":"Our party of four enjoyed our food however the rub was getting our drink orders wrong TWICE - almost comical when they kept tying to serve us sparkling water instead of the cava from the happy hour menu .  It was 45 minutes later when the correct drinks finally arrived.  And the final insult was getting the tab with charge for $47 more food/ drink than we actually ordered !  Apologies accepted but  we probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Always great food and service at Buck and Rider...and can't beat their happy hour. This is my go-to restaurant for oysters and great cocktails. Love the Buck and Rider cocktail!"}
{"text":"Food was lousy.   If it were not for the excellent server and manager I would have rated it zero stars. Think I went when they were still troubleshooting as they were only open a few weeks.  They charge for bread.  It was good except they salted it - horribly salted it.  Ordered sushi .. It was served as gigantic slices too large to place in your mouth.. and served at room temp. Ordered crab cakes, they were cold.   Free cookies on the way out..  salt on the cookies.  I'll try them again, one more chance."}
{"text":"This place is great been 3 times! The crab cakes are so yummy and with a Japanese flare I would highly recommend because they are very different and unique in flavor unlike anything I have ever had. The sushi is very fresh and delicious. The happy hour is a great deal with raw seafood,bar fare, meat dishes and craft drinks offered at a discount."}
{"text":"The oysters were super fresh and the ceviche appetizer had awesome flavor. A bit on the high side, price wise for me, but other than that we had a great dinner there."}
{"text":"No reservations taken so plan accordingly. Sundays are half priced sushi rolls and most wines. Their gin and house tonic is nicely floral and refreshing. Around the table, the starters were oysters, jumbo shrimp, California roll and softshell crab gazpacho.  The only disappointment was the firm avocado in the roll. Mains were crab cakes, softshell crab salad and the \"surf & turf.\"  No complaints or issues, but a fair warning about the sweet chili spicy dressing with the softshell crab salad, have it brought separately, it's packs much more of a punch than the bottled stuff. For desert, the banana cream pie was ordered two ways, with and without banana (some don't like bananas.) and the server, Ms. Robles, didn't blink at the request and was at the top of her game with wine pairings and service."}
{"text":"Seafood Tower.... Yes!!!!  Crab cakes... Yes!!! Brunch and bottomless mimosas... Yes!!! Best seafood in town!"}
{"text":"We came here for my mother's birthday. Our first time, and we had the best experience. All the way from emailing Cameron for reservations, all the way to the free dessert they brought my mom for her bday. Awesome! Our waitress, and the team who brought our food we're top notch. Everyone was smiles, and had a great disposition. The calimari (not pictured) was great. As well as my step-dad and mom's fish they ordered (also not pictured) was just amazing. We all had a wonderful experience and want to thank you for taking it great!"}
{"text":"Food was so subpar that I am compelled to write a review as I am finishing dinner.  Steak was overcooked and sides had so much sauce that they were inedible.  If you love salt, you will love the crab cakes.  All the water in my body has been completely absorbed by the salt in the crab cakes...heading home to down a gallon of water."}
{"text":"This is an excellent value for a higher end steak restaurant. The service was very good. The menu was well constructed with interesting twists and ingredients in everything from the cocktails to the apps, main dishes, and desserts. Had a perfectly prepared rib-eye. We sat outside on a cool evening and the heat lamps and fire place kept our large party very comfortable. Would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Shoohioot! This place ain't haff bad. It's in a decent spot of PHX but the joint is in the parking lot of a jack n the box and Some apartment complex. All good tho. Service was on point and food was tasty as hell  Here's what to do; Get you some mussels w extra bread to start. If them glutard biatch as w you give you sheeeiiit, send en my way. Also, gets A bunch on bourbon cocktails and A ribeye. Yep. You heard. Steak is bit coin. Tried a Bit of the sea food and other than the mussels was fiddy fiddy like centy centy."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Host & hostess were extremely friendly and sitting at the bar was a cool experience watching oysters get chucked. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Buck & Rider for the first time for our joint birthday dinner on Saturday night at 6pm.  The Pros:  Service was friendly, prompt and attentive from the several servers who came to our table.  Our martinis were icy cold and just the way we like them.  The seafood selections were plentiful; I've never seen a combined platter of chilled shellfish at other Valley restaurants (see picture below).  The seafood was very fresh and the taste was excellent.  The platter was served with three sauces - mignonette, pomeroy mustard (sort of a mild mustardy mayo sauce) and an eye-poppingly horseradishy cocktail sauce, all of which were delicious.  The Cons:  At 6pm on Saturday the bar was jammed and deafeningly loud.  Although the dining room was not yet full, the sound from the bar carried into the dining area and made it difficult to talk. (The restaurant is approximately half bar and half dining area, although they have a nice patio which would probably be best if you want a lower noise level.)  They were out of bread for 30 minutes (at 6pm on a Saturday?) and when it finally arrived, it was soft dinner rolls brushed with butter and sprinkled with salt.  They were warm and soft, but I would have preferred crusty artisan bread.  I can get squishy dinner rolls by the dozen at the grocery store.  And finally, the prices are steep.  The dinner rolls cost $9, crab cakes were $34, our seafood platter (with an extra half lobster) was $98, individual oysters are $3.50.  They have happy hour every day until 7pm but oysters aren't discounted; Little Cleo's has happy hour during the week where oysters are $1 apiece.  The Verdict:  We enjoyed our dinner very much and would go back for a special occasion, but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I loved the sushi, the yuzu roll was on point. However, I thought $18 for the lobster roll was way overpriced for the portion size. I ordered the rose cider which I thought was refreshing. Something about the seaweed salad tasted off -- I didn't want to finish it and I adore seaweed. I also ordered jumbo shrimp which were good. I didn't like the cocktail sauce being overly horseradishy and so when I asked for some a little less strong I was given ketchup to dilute which I wasn't thrilled about... I will go back to try some more of the raw bar and sushi. Right now the verdict is still out...  I wished that they had east coast oysters available as well. I don't particularly care for the flavor of the west coast ones."}
{"text":"Amazing! All around- shrimp cocktail with fresh horseradish, the brunch potato hash skillet is unlike any potato dish I've ever had, dinner rolls with salt flakes, chicken sandwich is simple yet explosive in flavor, Ahi tuna burger...just get it. The atmosphere is warm and low key, and the patio has a great fireplace and bar. Great place to chill with good people.  I do wish their order in/pick up was more streamlined, and acknowledging people arriving at the bar with a simple hello/ I'll be right with you would be appreciated. However, I would definitely still go to Buck & Rider- one of my absolute favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best salmon I have ever eaten. It is cooked in a chili preparation and is deliciously spicy.Great location. Quality of the food is superb. Once you try the salmon, you'll go nowhere else for salmon in Phoenix. It is prepared in a very healthy fashion."}
{"text":"We are in town from Seattle and found this Gem. Our server was Marlee. She and the other staff really made our experience here unforgettable. Thank you ALL for some amazing drinks and delicious seafood, sushi, salad and deserts. We tried several items on the menu and all of them were delicious.  The service here is hands down probably the best I have ever experienced. Thanks again and we look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite neighborhood spots. The decor is amazing and the menu is well done. Some of the best service around as well. I've tried the calamari, numerous sushi rolls, a white fish meal for a dinner and the gumbo for lunch. The gumbo is some of the best I've had in a long time; I'd highly recommend it. The patio out front looks amazing and I look forward to checking that out as well. Great spot for a business dinner, date night, grabbing drinks or celebrating something special. Well done!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of our top 5 meals of all time. The food was delicious and the service was top notch. We started with the Crab and Macadamia Roll. My husband got the swordfish grilled with the beurre blanc sauce. I had the halibut, pan seared with the beurre blanc sauce. OMG."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! I saw it on Instagram and followed them. The pictures dont even compare to what its really like when your there. The food was spectacular!!! The Oyster Bar was Excellent for Happy Hour and the prices were great for what you get. Service was fabulous at the bar! Never once did we do without anything! Such a pretty restaurant! Cant wait to go back again! This is my new favorite spot when i visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary in December. Oysters were delicious! Loved this place. Will definitely be our go to place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was cooked perfectly, the place is really cool too. I would recommend coming for happy hour."}
{"text":"I had several of their oysters and received two severely mutilated oysters and two were questionable/expired.  I tried the Nik Nik which was very small and not traditional, the soup was marginal for the price, rolled crab sushi was suspect, The Thai Dressing was offensive, the \"Prime\" steak came out over cooked, the \"sea bass\" should be explained better.  The dessert was flat, service was mixed with quick apps but entrees took 30+ minutes, seemed like we were forgot. Cocktail and wine refills not offered, we had to grab a different waitress to get us a glass of water, I could go on but I wont be back."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to Buck & Rider. The service is always on point and the food always meets the expectations. Annie took care of us last night and she has great personality and very attentive!! The managers make sure you are happy with every service... Just go and have a great time and enjoy the great drinks/food!!"}
{"text":"Buck & Rider  Buck and Rider has recently become one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. It is a great place to take a date or friends if you really want to impress them. Not to mention, the food and cocktails are just as great as the ambience. It really fits the definition of a 'cool' place.  When you first pull in to the restaurant, the first thing you will notice is that the only type of parking they have is complimentary valet, which already starts the night on the right foot. When I first stepped foot inside, I was blown away by the décor, music, and vibes the entire place was putting out. It felt exactly like being in a hip restaurant in Beverly Hills. Though there is no required dress code, I noticed that everybody is very well dressed and fits the part the restaurant meets. After I let the environment sink in, we were greeted by a fleeted of young very attractive hostesses who were very friendly.   Buck and Rider aims to seat customers right away, but we decided to start at the bar for a cocktail first. At the bar, you will notice a shellfish station, where professionals are shucking oysters and peeling other seafood along side to the talented bartenders. The cocktail menu is very exquisite including their own signature drinks. My girlfriend ordered the Tequila Sunrise, which she said was great, but I stuck to a draught beer, the Ballast Point Lager, which is rare for restaurants to carry as it is an outstanding one.  After being seating, the waitress is very attentive and accommodates to our needs making sure we have our waters full and a drink in our hand. We decided to order some oysters, which are fresh daily. They have all different kinds of oysters depending on your preference. I prefer ones that are smaller and more briny. They were very very delicious, and probably some of the best oysters I have had in the valley. That night I decided to order my favorite dish, which is the chicken. They only have one type of chicken there so it is very simple. The chicken comes as just a piece of breast that has some type of sauce on it. It is not dry at all and very tasty to say the least. The way I explain it undermines how good it actually is because that chicken is actually one of the best dishes I have ever had a restaurant, and I am not over-exaggerating. It really was one of the best dishes I've had personally. My girlfriend had the Trout which I tried and it was also delicious. I have also had the Radio Milano Pasta Troife and again that dish was great too. I have always been too stuffed to try dessert there but I have no doubt in my mind it is fantastic as well.  When the check came, I was actually surprised at how little it costs. What you get seems a lot more than what you pay for. The service is great, the atmosphere is incredible, the drinks are outstanding, and the food is to die for, all at a reasonable price. After leaving, valet is very quick but I might be biased because they park exotic cars in the front. Overall, I have no other way to recommend this place more and created a Yelp account just for it. Please please please go and do yourself a favor and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Good seafood is hard to find in Phoenix. B n R does a good job but I wouldn't call the good 5 star. The ambiance and patio seating are fabulous on a sunny afternoon. The decor is divine but the food was okay. I come from the northwest so I may be ultra picky...but the lobster roll I had was nothing to get excited about. I would be willing to try it again but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"This was the best  restaurant  I have been to in Phoenix yet! Awesome service from our waitress she was amazing! The food just fabulous! The drinks delicious!! I'm going back the day after tomorrow with my friends!!! So so yummy"}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal here! I swear they get better every single time we come, from the service, the cool and beautiful inside to the quality and thoughtfulness of the food. Buck &rider is so darn good. I literally would come here everyday if I could. I already can't wait to return. Hands down the best restaurant in AZ. Just so friendly too! Love it!"}
{"text":"We went to Buck and Rider for the first time and wow this place was amazing. We went for brunch but the lunch menu was so impressive that it made it hard to chose something. We had eggs Benedict, an ahi burger and 3 different oysters and everything was amazing!  And the service was incredible!  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere. Only complaint is their rosé selection. Who doesn't want rosé with their oysters and seafood? They only have one option and it is not very good. Other than that I love this place. Good for happy hour and brunches too!"}
{"text":"The absolute best seafood in town. The oysters are fresh and the crab cakes are seriously to die for! They also have an outstanding brunch menu, don't sleep on it! The location is great and the staff is genuine and friendly. Great atmosphere for a special occasion or a friends night out or even a small event. I highly recommend Buck & Rider if you want to eat well and impress your friends, lol!"}
{"text":"Always a great happy hour option. The Diego Rivera is my favorite. The oysters are always fresh, and the service always great! The ceviche is also a winner."}
{"text":"Pretty good. See images for individual review. Ambiance was nice but the staff was a little slow even though it was pretty empty. Food came out promptly and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Tonight we celebrated out 29th anniversary. We saw reviews for Buck & Rider so decided to try it. Wow! Everything we ate was amazing! We love sushi and the two rolls we chose were unique and delicious. I had the steak and crab cakes- flawless! My husband had the scallops- equally delicious. Staff was helpful and friendly. Thank you for an awesome evening. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times...and I wouldn't give Buck & Rider a 5-star until my last visit.  I THINK THEY FINALLY STOP FORCING VALET PARKING ON CUSTOMERS!!!  YAY!!!  Great restaurant...I mean, there is nothing I can complain about.  Service, food, atmosphere.....oh wait there is the price..it's pricey but I get what I paid for.  But I did not come here as much I wanted to, because of their annoying valet parking rule.  I even contact the restaurant about it, and their general manager Laura told me valet on duty would let me pass if I told them she \"okayed\" it.  That's not the case, still have to beg to do self-parking.  I understand some people love valet parking but can't that be a choice, especially when the parking lot is not full?  Can we have at least the option to pay valet on duty $2-$3 then self-park?  Now I think about it...I went on a Sunday noon so I am not sure if they totally got rid of the valet parking or just for Sunday.  Hopefully its permanent.  Anyway, Buck & Rider's oysters are the BEST in Arizona, period.  Forget about the oysters you have tried at the down-town oyster bar or at the angry crab's.  If you are obsess with raw oysters, you won't be disappointed here.  The only problem is the price.  Even with their half-off happy hour price, you are still looking at approximately $24 a dozen.  They usually have at least 6 type of oysters (it's a marketing thing but I am buying it).  I usually get a few of each to just try it out then decide what to get next.  If you don't want to try all 6, then I would suggest go for different region (WA vs. NJ) because they can name the oysters in WA any way they want, but they don't taste that different in most cases.  They also have good oyster chefs, which is very important.  Few selections on beers but they are all good beers.  Good selection on food too.  Only wish they are close to my house.  UPDATE 6/21/2017 - I actually receive several messages about their valet parking.  I understand some of you hate it to the point that you refuse to go to this restaurant so here is a tip - Go early before dinner time.  I was there a week ago and I think valet is enforced during \"busy time\".  I hope someone from the management team can clarify this and maybe tell us how to properly avoid the valet parking.  It is annoying and a hassle to deal with very pushy valet staffs when there are obviously parking spaces at the self-parking lot."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! This rivals Mastro's Ocean Club in Scottsdale. We met friends for dinner and everyone loved it. The lobster Nik Niks and the king crab appetizer were phenomenal. The red snapper and salmon...wow. We had so many appetizers that we didn't have room for dessert but, next time for sure! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was our 4th time here and its still gets better. The service and care given to customers is amazing as well as first class seafood fare. We love it here and always enjoy the fish of the day with a nice rye whisky. This is the top tier seafood place in the valley for us."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's a but on the speedy side but with every right as the seafood is incredibly fresh. I wish I remembered our servers name. She had long brown hair and bangs - she was great and very delightful! She even put a candle in my ice cream for my birthday."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for happy hour! Great quality seafood , drinks and even better service. However, I decided to try something new and ordered the Lobster Roll\"Nik Niks\" and it was very disappointing, nothing like your standard lobster roll was more like lobster bruschetta and two small pieces. For the price you would be better off ordering the half lobster."}
{"text":"Had the trout. They tried to do too much with it, breading, sauce etc. Just wrap it in bacon and broil it. The fish after I  scraped all the crap off it was perfectly done. The clam chouder was mediocre, the clams were too  chewy for me. The taste was so so. I had komo to oysters and they were fresh and excellent. Ambiance and staff was A+. I'll go back. It looked like the sushi was nice. I want to try another fish after all that's what they say they are good at."}
{"text":"This place is nice and intimate. It has a roomy patio space, which is great for these Phoenix nights.  Our server was friendly. Initially, the salad I ordered didn't have the added seared tuna and she got it fixed right away. I got the seafood superfood salad, and it was interesting...it's not a bad interesting, but I haven't decided if it's a good interesting, haha. The dressing was really good though.  I tried a piece of my mom's sea bass and my dad's halibut. Both were nicely cooked and had good flavor. As far as appetizers, we got the rolls - which were good however, I'm not used to having to pay for rolls for the table. I mean it was $7 for 5 rolls. Also, we got the crispy hash browns and they were as you'd think. Nothing special, but it was easy to share and crispy.   Overall, the dinner was quick and easy. The food came out easy, and the service was good."}
{"text":"The service was slow, even at 11:15 am on a Wednesday. My friends avocado was way over salted, and my crab cakes smelled & tasted fishy. I don't plan to go back. Very disappointing for a restaurant from the people behind LGO."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at dinner a few nights ago.  The food was great, the staff was great!  Then I heard about the brunch and bottomless mimosas!!!!  Great spot and large patio!  Looking forward to try out the brunch!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous happy hour. Hard to describe but important that you experience it. Bar staff is phenomenal. Especially Nicole. Ask for her. Food is amazing. Laura the GM is the role model for how to do customer service. At the risk of losing access to my favorite corner bar stool...everyone should come here at least once. Or more."}
{"text":"Great place.  Fab outdoor patio!   Had the surf & turf and was amazing!   Oysters out of this world.   Love this place"}
{"text":"Drinks at this place were amazing! Surf and turf was amazing! Bar scene was super classy! Meals were fresh and tasty! Great spot!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place!!! I came in for my birthday dinner (along with tons of other times before that) and was left feeling the most content I've felt in a long time!!! I was SOOOOO satisfied! food coma-heaven everything from the appetizers to the main dishes were amazing! I had the sea bass and oh my word was it fabulous! We ended up going with a large group of people, so I ended up trying almost everyone's dish and nothing left me feeling disappointed! If you are into seafood at all you have to try this place!!!   The cocktails are also amazing... Actually, a little too good that I can put back several and not notice until I stand up!  This spot is also a wonderful brunch place! If you do end up going during brunch time please do yourself a favor and try their hash browns!!! They come out on a hot skillet with sour cream and I'm not kidding when I tell you I could eat these everyday for the rest of my life and never be sad ever again!  Service... I'd give just the service 10 stars if I could! All the staff from the managers to the bussers are all super friendly and knowledgeable!   I'll be back a million time over! YUMMMM!"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. I had the market salmon pan fried with the lemon buerr-Blanc sauce and acorn squash side. It was the most delicious thing. Also we tried some oysters for the first time. The server picked two types for us. As a new oyster eater I couldn't taste the difference. Maybe it was too much cocktail sauce. Not to say it was bad though.   I took off one star as the service wasn't great. It took about 10 minutes after we were seated for someone to initially come to our table and take our drink orders. It didn't improve from there. Other than that, it was very friendly and the atmosphere was relaxing and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"The Hong Kong halibut was grub.  Really good service from Errin.  Would definitely come back and try some of the other food.  They have a good craft beer list as well."}
{"text":"We heard, We came, We saw......We tasted. We want to go back again today but still full. Tried the sushi rolls.....different and fantastic. We tried the brussel sprouts.......different and delicious. I tried Aunt Charlie the vodka drink made with tea.....give me more! I tried the hash brown potatoes.....so much I had to take some home and they were cooked right and tasty. Then dinner.......but I was already full but had to have the filet and lobster and my wife had the crab cakes........sooooo delicious. Desert? Loosen the belt and have some banana cream pie.....not too sweet just yummy. Could not have enjoyed without an excellent server ...., thanks Angelinea. Good food and atmosphere just as you would expect from an LGO restaurant."}
{"text":"On our last day in Scottsdale after a golf game, my wife and I stopped in based on the Yelp reviews and proximity to our hotel. What a great find! We went through almost everything on their happy hour list and loved each bite! The oysters and lobster were fresh and at a great price. Steak tartare was best I've had.  I order it every time I see it on a menu. Christian the bartender was so knowledgeable and engaging. He made a spectacular Old Fashion and presented it with a full back story on the drink. A real pro.   If we had discovered this place earlier, we would have been there every day!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past 2 weeks so that should tell ya that I like the food. There are hundreds of reviews raving about the freshness of the seafood and it's all true! Especially the oyster bar selection, it's amazing! Wish, I could rate this place 5 stars but honestly on both occasions the service was subpar. On both occasions, when I walked in with my guest the host table was an obvious source of confusion. There needs to be host at the front at all times, instead it's just whoever is paying attention seats you. I shouldn't have to be asked \"have you been helped\" multiple times. Secondly, once seated both times the waitresses seemed aloof and it wasn't even busy. I shouldn't have to ask someone who isn't my server for a drink. I'll be back again but seriously for as much as this place is the service needs to be tightened."}
{"text":"The place is great all around... best raw bar in Arcadia... always a friendly crowd as well. Been there many times with friends and took coworkers earlier this week. Annie (the bartender) was great and the drinks we top notch. We can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed New Year's and lunch sushi runs here and every meal has been exceptional. I've had mostly seafood. Fresh oysters were chilled, salty and delish. Sushi options are great. I go every time I'm in the area unfortunately don't live as close as I used to. Grab a chocolate chip cookie when you leave. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night with my friends. Their happy hour is a smoking deal, and I had a full pound of king crab for I think $24. It was delicious too, very fresh. My friends had oysters and sushi rolls and everything was good and fresh. The waitresses were all very sweet and attentive too. We will definitely being back very soon as this is our new \"go to\" spot!"}
{"text":"I hoped for more...the food was very good, just not for the price. Also, I ordered a dirty martini and I was given a glass of straight gin. The waitress insisted it was dirty saying \"our olive juice is clear.\" I guess she noticed the blank look on my face because she brought me a ramekin of olive juice to add five minutes later. You guessed it...wasn't clear. For the price paid, please don't lie to my face and just admit the drink was made incorrectly.   On the bright side, I had their gumbo, and it was excellent. I'm from South Louisiana and make gumbo regularly, so I know good gumbo. This would sell better than most in Louisiana!   I may give it another chance...next time without my mother in law!"}
{"text":"While the black bass was a bit on the dry side, I did enjoy my selection of oysters.  The brussle sprouts were good, but it could have been better if it wasn't so burnt.  The balsamic vinegar helped guard the burnt taste, but this is not the way to go.  Not on the menu are the oyster rockefellers, it was a special order, unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointment.  It was essentially baked oysters, without any toppings, so sad."}
{"text":"A great find for seafood lovers in Central Phoenix. The interior of the restaurant is a pleasant surprise from its simple exterior. Upon entering the restaurant, you'll see their raw bar (stone crabs, alaskan king, oysters) all looking fresh and delightful. I opted to try the spicy tuna roll, good serving size with plenty of tuna inside. My husband got the fried calamari which comes with a thai dipping sauce. Both were delicious. I got the miso glazed salmon, cooked to perfection but I wish it came with a milder flavored side as the pine nuts overpowered the salmon. My husband was happy with his Loup De Mer fish sandwich served with coleslaw. Don't expect a crispy fish fillet, it's pan fried. We ended our meal with Pistachio gelato. All in all, happy with the quality of the food and service and will surely come back to try their dinner menu. I'm eyeing the lobster roll."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We had great drinks. The oysters, calamari, King Crab, and the roasted Brussels were to die for. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Those cookies they have in the front are addictive. Don't pass on one nor should you pass on the chocolate cake and yummy homemade hazelnut ice cream. Ask for an extra scoop"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome and the food was very good, Nicole L our waitress was off the chain good a very funny we enjoyed her service and attitude. We Also discussed the picking up the hot towels with the tongs and agreed the laynard was the best option lol....thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour, which goes until 7pm most days, with a reverse/late night happy hour after 930pm on thurs-weekend. They're the only place in town that I've found consistently serving kumamoto oysters, and all their other oyster options are great, too! Tonight we got the steak tartare ($9 HH price) and house wine ($6) which were both solid. Complimentary valet parking, which I feel is a little unnecessary given the size of their lot, but service was great all around. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"One buck, two buck, three buck, four ..... this little rider wanted more.   Wow, what a place. This was my first time there and it certainly did not disappoint. I decided to try this gem for restaurant week knowing they had a featured  menu. Friends have been suggesting Buck & Rider for a while so it was finally time to give it a shot.   I pulled up and was greeted by valet drivers. Opened my door and parked my car. My only embarrassment here was that I didn't have fancy enough car to have it parked in the front lol. We walked in and despite not having reservations and despite it being a Saturday night we were told it would only be 30 minutes. While we waited we were offered drinks and cocktails. They even had complimentary cookies to sweeten your taste buds as you wait. We were finally seated in a nice romantic spot with just the right lighting.   The interior was spectacular. Not too dark not too bright. Really did feel romantic and intimate. The fresh oyster bar was right in front for all to see as the masters prepped those little succulents.   We ordered drinks and looked over the menu. We ended up choosing oysters, the crab cakes and asparagus as well as the New York strip steak with a loaded baked potato. The oysters were seriously some of the best I have had. The crab cakes were literally all crab. Which was amazing. Normally restaurants will add filler but not here. The steak was spectacular. Tender and grilled exactly how we ordered it. It was so juicy and so flavorful that I yearned for more and more. We ended the evening with some gelato.   Overall way to go Buck & Rider !! Would recommend this restaurant and would definitely go back.   Only small disappointment was that they ran out of fish and only had Salmon left."}
{"text":"Try a new spot with the girls tonight and I have to say this place is a gem!!! When we got there they sat us right away and got us taken care of.  I have the Crispy Brussels sprouts to start with, normally I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts because they're too salty but I was told to try these and boy did I make the right decision. It had the perfect balance and that goat cheese sauce was to die for.  Then I had the prime New York strip, it was so tender and had a perfect amount to char that I could still taste all the flavors of the meat!!!! Overall, I would have to say if your looking for a nice place that knows what they are doing this is the stop!!!!  LGO has yet done it again!!!!"}
{"text":"A very steak and seafood kind of establishment.  The food and service are very good.  They do have some vegan options but I'd go there more often if they had more plant based dishes."}
{"text":"Went there for a great lunch.  Had the half lobster and the spicy crab salad.  Great selection of booze and the wine list was tidy.  French fries were amazing.  Was clear they spent a bit of money on the fit out and it has  the usual swagger of the LGO group."}
{"text":"Some of the best happy hour around! $6 cocktails and $1 oysters. We ordered a slew of things to share, dozen oysters, steak tartare, Arcadia roll, calamari, dixie chicken, seafood cocktail, and many many drinks. Super fresh seafood and great mix of food options. Of all the food we ordered, the dixie chicken was the least favorite, actually thought it was rather bland. Arcadia roll and steak tartare was really good. Also, the bartenders have a strong pour ;)"}
{"text":"First time here and it was so busy and they sat us at the raw bar and we got our food right away! The Brussels sprouts are the best I have ever had and It was the best oysters I have ever had too!! I will come back for more! The service was amazing and the atmosphere was great too!! Love this place!! Will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but  I will get to that later...   I enjoy cooking, so when I go out its for ambience and service, or Im with a friend/date, but thats not to say I don't go out often, because I do, perhaps more than I should. In this case, I was with a male friend who enjoys eating out as much as I do.  So, heres my deal.  We arrived on a monday afternoon and it happened to be happy hour.  Both of us have eaten extensively in our lives and not newbies to a dang menu.  The service we had was belittling. When our female server arrived, she was nice at first until we asked her \"whats going on here?\" (both of us looking at the happy hour menu.  This was a gesture to get her opinion and maybe guide us to whats fun, or how we should order.  SHE LOOKED AT US WITH THE UGLIEST RUDEST FACE then proceeded to run her finger over every word that she continued to literally speak out every word as if we could not read.  I had to look away outside because it was so off putting.. we ended up not eating off the regular menu because of this. instead we just said, ok give us 2 lobsters a dozen oysters, fried rice, ceviche and the tar tar.. which is basically everything off the happy hour menu minus a two items. I wanted to say to her so badly that she is so wrong as a server.  It was like she didn't want to describe anything to us, or give us any leads to what is good to her.  Service is why I won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent quality food, specifically their seafood. Vest oysters I've had in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"First: Loved the atmosphere, the outdoor patio facing Camelback mountain, the background music, the kind and smiling waitresses and the whole staff. From the time you come in to when you leave, you're treated like a V.I.P.: complimentary Valet parking as soon as you arrive, and complimentary cookies waiting for you on your way out! Amazing customer service: as soon as you ask for something, it's done!  Second: I'm from Italy and I LOVE fish, and I can tell you that those oysters are F-R-E-S-H (they have them shipped to the restaurant from WA state Every Day!) and they're truly delicious! I just squeezed some lemon on them, like we do in Italy, but they also serve some sauces, if you prefer. As an entree, I ordered fresh fish of the day (Striped Sea Bass was my choice) and it was really good; just wished the portion was bigger :) Their Pistacchio Gelato paired with dark chocolate cake was the absolute best I've had in the USA in my 15 years on this side of the ocean! Buck & Rider gets my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food, service is usually pretty good, prices are on the higher end."}
{"text":"The calamari here is amazing! I love the atmosphere of this place.  Service is fast and friendly.  Jonas,  the manager is very pleasant and always stops by.  I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"High quality seafood at reasonable prices.  Dixie chicken appetizers rock, shrimp, lobster.  Wife and daughters really enjoyed prices were very fair."}
{"text":"Buck & Rider is amazing for their food and service. I worked with their event coordinator Lauren W for a 50 person corporate dinner and her and her team went above and beyond to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ten stars!!! Food was so yummy! The best: fresh made tonic that made a vodka tonic totally fresh. The sauce in the mussels... I could drink it with a straw it was so good. Def a few growing pains as its brand new. They ran out of calamari and corn bread by 7. The cornbread was amazing!!!!! I must go back and get more, I think I'll go tomorrow. Delicious, fun, hip, great great place."}
{"text":"Oysters are fantastic. Super fun Happy Hour. Staff is great. Love the place. Plus, free valet all of the time. This place rocks. Two thumbs up. Food is awesome, all of it but the raw bar is my favorite."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here and it was surprisingly cozy and inviting inside. A seafood restaurant in Phoenix with a lodge style inside? A difficult concept to grasp but the drinks and good were ON POINT. Service was lickety-split and our waitress Ariana was attentive, friendly knowledgeable about the items offered. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is pretty awesome. I felt like we walked into a lodge in the Pacific NorthWest. We just went in for drinks. Steak 44 was a little too busy and we wanted something a little quieter. I have a seafood allergy so stayed away from the food, but the drinks were fantastic.  Their drinks remind me of the cocktails I like to order at The Windsor. We were there late and I've read reviews about their reverse happy hour but the bartender didn't mention it and our drinks were full price. Regardless, we will be back. The experience was great."}
{"text":"Buck & Rider delivers seafood at its best with presentation and taste! I can't wait for an excuse to return; I mean, oysters are good for any occasion, right? I arrived on a busy Friday night where we were told there would be a wait by the courteous host who also stated to feel free to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. The bar is very well stocked with various liquors and libations and also doubles as a beautiful display of their oysters and other selfish fare. Before we had even gotten our drinks poured, our host came by to tell us that our table was ready, score!   We arrived to the table with our drinks and started perusing the appetizer menu and decided to start with the brussel sprouts, these were amazing but they are deep fried so I would not recommend them if you are looking for a nutrient-packed appetizer. In addition, we ordered the spicy tuna tostadas which were TO DIE FOR. They use the more traditional pickled carrots and peppers which really makes the flavors come together. What's rare about this place is the fact that you can order the oysters individually so our waitress recommended 2 different \"sweeter\" tasting types of oysters. Both types had the distinct oyster flavor but were amazingly palatable. I finished with the Blackened Redfish Veracruz and opted for extra sauce instead of the jasmine rice it is normally accompanied by. The sauce was a rich and hearty wonderfully spiced tomato sauce but the actual fish its self was pretty bland, perhaps just a characteristic of redfish, like tilapia? For dessert was the lemon meringue pie, which came highly recommended by our waitress. She mentioned to us that this is the precise thing she fantasizes about for her \"cheat days\" and it did not disappoint! Tart and tangy and a delicious cinnamon graham cracker crust to lust over.  The service here was excellent across the board from the host staff, bartender, and waitress and quick although the restaurant was buzzingly busy. I always appreciate a server who takes time to chat and make recommendations and has a vast knowledge of the menu. (Thanks Ariana!) Great place to bring a large party as they only make reservations for parties of 6 or larger, but take your date here and they will surely not be disappointed! The total bill at the end of the meal was $87 and this was for 2 mixed drinks, 2 appetizers, oysters, an entree, and dessert! Quite reasonable for the quality of the food, service, and total experience of the place. I highly recommend Buck & Rider and suggest you do not miss out on the seafood portions of the menu!"}
{"text":"I have had drinks and dinner at Buck and Rider a few times now.  I have to say that the seafood is always terrific, fresh and flavorful.  Last night however,  really gave me an impression of the quality of this restaurant--if only they were all this way.  We were celebrating a birthday.  Orders included salmon (excellent!) whitefish of the day (excellent!), calamari (excellent!) and two orders of seafood gumbo --when the gumbo came--there was no doubt there was sausage but no seafood--we confirmed with wait staff that it was supposed to be seafood gumbo--she said yes --clearly the seafood part of the gumbo--didn't make it in the bowl--I made another comment to her --as i handed her my empty bowl--as the liquid part of the gumbo was very good--one of my eating companions had not finished hers--so there was clear evidence that the seafood had not made it to  the party.  The way the restaurant handled this really shows the quality of the management. The wait staff apologized and said she would let the kitchen know immediately--the manager came over shortly thereafter--apologized again and took the cost of both orders off the bill--In addition the dessert we had ordered was also comped.    In this day and age  with the level of rudeness and crassness that surrounds us everywhere--it was so nice to feel respected and that staff had the authority to make things right--Buck and Rider will continue to be on my go to list--because of this and of course the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 11- great seafood for Scottsdale. Cold platters were great and the halibut was boss. Drinks were good not great, but well crafted. Literally only negative was the free cookies in the front. Salty and gross. Don't touch them but everything else is bueno"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday for dinner with my wife during the happy hour. Drink specials are awesome during happy hour!  Cocktails were great with some variations on old favorites. We stuck with the small plates for the most part- corn crab chowder, tuna tostadas, wife had oysters and was pleased. Anna was our server and she was excellent and great with suggestions."}
{"text":"We visited for dinner and were not very impressed.  They couldn't get the steak medium rare right and the Hong Kong style halibut was chewy.  Service and management were very receptive though.  Nice atmosphere.  Just wished the food matched it. The bread is great!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday celebration. Loved it! First sat in the bar for a cocktail and happy hour food. The oysters were excellent, fresh and flavorful and shucked in view. The signature cocktails were spot on. Then we sat on the patio for dinner. Crab cakes were the standout. Definitely going back...those half price oysters for happy hour can't be beat."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's one of my favorite places for happy hour, and lunch. Everything I've tried has been very flavorful! My favorite thing on the menu right now is the Evil Thai King crab salad. I go by and get it once a week, because it's that good! The service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Exceptional happy hour!  M-Sat between 11:30-4.  It's 1/2 off the bar menu including their raw bar.  They have a variety of oysters and we tried most of them and they were unbelievably fresh.  The brussels sprouts and spicy tuna roll were great.  They also have 1/2 off lobster and $6 cocktails and wine.  I ordered two of their One Night in Babylon cocktails.  It was made with cucumber and gin and delicious!"}
{"text":"Damn.... this is place is good.  1. atmosphere is cool, hip, vibe and can be casual or dressy. You make the call. 2. service is uber attentive..our server was Lizzie. She is A rated, beast mode, the best server I have ever had.  3. food is straight out 5 stars. the menu rocks, the apps rock and its just flat out awesome.  We had  Stone crab claws Shrimp cocktail Scallops Baked potato(crazy good) Gumbo- awesome..needs a pinch of salt(but im a salt aholic) Aracdian salad Key lime cake/pie  crazy good, get in line, but enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"I came to Buck & Rider with some friends and was blown away! Coming in a group allowed  us to try a lot of different items and I can confidently say everything We had was outstanding! The raw bar selection was the best I've seen in the state and being shipped daily is freshness you can taste! From Sushi We tried the crunchy shrimp roll, spicy tuna and the lobster tobanjan roll which were all so unique and full of flavor! Later on We shared the shrimp and chorizo skewers, ahi tuna tostadas, lobster nik niks, Mussels and Brussel sprouts which were the best I've ever had.  For our mains we got to try the Hong Kong Halibut which was perfectly cooked, Crab cakes that were full of crab, Snapper Veracruz-grilled to perfection and accompanied a delicious tomato based stew-sauce and the Salmon which was super tender and velvety from the miso marinade. I also highly recommend trying their signature cocktails- The buck and rider, Aunt Charlie and Your money or your life. All perfectly crafted and pairs perfectly with your meal.  To top it off service is impeccable and accommodation, ambiance is a dream and quality food is at its best. I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and well-decorated. And the food was exquisite. My friend and I ordered from the Oyster Bar and also ordered there lobster rolls. Everything was a taste sensation. Especially the Ms. Callahan cocktail."}
{"text":"My favorite place for happy hour oysters and their fried rice is to die for! Try their cucumber drink (can't recall the name), the cucumber juice is made fresh daily."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very delicious food. Recently dined there and ordered 12 oysters (2 of each type) and two were missing. After we flagged our server down she went and got the two that were missing. All of them were very tasty! I do mention to people often that this restaurant has great oysters and seafood. For dinner I had the scallops and they were cooked well and very tasty. I had taken our server's recommendation on the sauce (romesco) and that was not the right choice since it tasted awful with the scallops so I used my date's lemon caper beurre blanc and it paired much nicer with it. The service is always mediocre there so 3/5 for service, 4/5 for food. Also, you really should get pinot grigio on the wine list. It usually goes really well with seafood."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Buck and Rider on a Thursday night. Bar was packed at 6PM, but dining room was virtually empty. The facility is great and the service was excellent all the way through the experience. The food was hit and miss. They specialize in raw seafood and I sampled some oysters. They were great. The cocktails were just OK. The bar had no Chambord. For a place of this status, the bar should be stocked better and the bartenders should be more flexible. The calamari appetizer was a complete miss. We rejected the first batch due to it being way overcooked. The second batch was better but you could get the same dish at any decent chain in town. My wife chose the Silver salmon special and it came out overdone but cold. Their excuse was that it is served on a cold salad. If that was the problem, maybe the dish is designed incorrectly. My guess is that the salmon sat waiting for my steak and died. My filet was cooked properly and was hot. It is a good value at $32. They comp'ed the calamari and the salmon, but I would have preferred a better meal. In conclusion, this place is a happy hour bar with excellent service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Been here twice for happy hour, and I am hooked! The Happy Hour (4-7) can't be beat with awesome deals on food and drinks. The lobster was a little chewy, but the crab legs, oysters, steak tartare, and Dixie Picnic Chicken are phenomenal. Seriously, you can't go wrong with any of the Happy Hour food or cocktails!  I love this place and have been raving about it to my friends. The only reason for 4 not 5 stars was the miscommunication tonight. Our server was great and worked with us to split bills; however, when my friend got her check it said one price, then after she gave the server her card, it came back with a more expensive receipt! Later, the server realized the manager had cancelled the happy hour pricing on the to-go food (totally reasonable policy). My friend wouldn't have ordered the to-go meal had it been full price (or at least would have ordered less). Instead, she was stuck with a bill $20 higher than the bill she was presented to pay. Also, doesn't anyone comp bday desserts anymore? Not an awesome ending to an otherwise great evening."}
{"text":"Great seafood, a classy go-to for dates, nice ambience and awesome hospitality- Cassie and Annie was were very welcoming and knowledgable.  One of the best in the area!"}
{"text":"My wife and i recently moved back to PHX after 5 years in the OC. We have a lot of new restaurants to try out and we decided to try Buck & Rider because we heard they have a good happy hour. We are big fans of LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen and looked forward to trying their new concept. Evidently so do others others because it was PACKED and the host was taking names for a table in the bar area. We stood up outside the bar the reception area and ordered some drinks and some happy hour food items while waiting about 30 minutes to sit down.  Positives - the food was good and the staff was helpful and polite, in spite of being overwhelmed by the large crowd. The sunset few of Camelback Mountain was awesome. Valet parking was free.  Negatives - it took some explanation from the staff and nearby patrons to figure out what was or was not included in the happy hour. The happy hour was only available at the inside bar - the outside bar was full price. The NOISE inside was excruciating, especially once we moved back to the bar table. My wife and I had to scream across the table to hear each other, which evidently is what the rest of the bar was doing. It was so LOUD that i used the noise meter on my iPhone to see it was 90+ decibels - borderline red zone. The noise was equivalent to an emergency vehicle. Not relaxing at all. Finally, the tab for two people  (2 beers, 1 gin & tonic, 1 glass of wine, 3 small plates) for happy hour, with tip was $100.  Bottom line - we will go to Hillstones or Chelsea's Kitchen or keep searching for a another good happy hour venue. We will try the Buck & Rider reverse happy hour after a movie some day."}
{"text":"Andre the mgr and his staff at Buck & Rider hands down are the complete package .. From beginning to end our visit to this fine establishment was flawless .. We came in to celebrate my Mothers B'day , let's just say, she can be hard to please but Andre made it easy ..  Andre made it special from the moment we walked in.. His staff accommodated all of our special menu request .. PEI mussels were perfection .. My father's pasta was so good he wouldn't even share,  he loved it so much ..  My scallops  were cooked to perfection, kudos to the kitchen staff .. We will for sure be back .. Very grateful"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service from Heather! Great wine selection, and fantastic oysters! I felt like I was back in Seattle."}
{"text":"Second time here... Its 5:50 on a friday night and they let is know they are out of sushi?? Really? OH! But let me tell you how well they took care of it! They got the sushi back up and running, and comped us a sushi and a slice of the amazing lemon meringue pie!"}
{"text":"So.... NOT east coast seafood !!     Applebee's with a sushi roll and a fireplace.. Damn ...It was so white trash ,generic ,blah.blah blah...   Loud interior...Just NOT .. Seafood     My white cracker opinion..!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!  Great food, great space, great service. The vibe of the restaurant was rustic casual. We ordered green chili corn bread, chicken tenders, and a few oysters for appetizers. All were excellent.  The cornbread had nice green chili flavor and a little sweet. The chicken tenders were crispy and came out hot, which I love. The oysters were very fresh and nice and salty. For entrees we had the miso salmon and the crab cakes.  Salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of faro and green beans. Crab cake was nice and meaty with a delicious mustard sauce. Nice and crispy on the punt side. We indulged on dessert and at the server's recommendation ordered the lemon merengue pie. It was out is this world. Nice an lemony with the right level of tartness on a pecan graham cracker crust. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a great place to drink and eat.  Happy Hour is killer good and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed the best brunch. Buck &Rider is a wonderful mix of creative food, fresh and crisp decor, and a staff that is genuinely delighted to have you visit.  The fresh seafood is just that. Fresh. And obvious care with the rest of the menu. LGO English muffins under the luscious crab cakes. A burst of flavor with the Thai crab salad. The spicy tuna rolls have chunks of tuna to enjoy. The new special brunch menu makes choices difficult.  But the staff ties it all together. With great suggestions and menu knowledge, they helped us make great food choices. All this with smiles and confidence.  Love the place and couldn't recommend it more highly."}
{"text":"Would've given 5 stars but they were literally out of all of my drink and food requests when I visited. I love the atmosphere, really friendly staff that were also attentive. I ordered the chicken sandwich even though I really wanted the Eggs Benny.. but it was good. The sauce on the bun was seriously deelish! Recommend overall!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day with my girlfriend. Very busy, but we had reservations and we waited at the bar a couple minutes until our table was ready. Delicious cocktails. Food was wonderful! My first time ever having oysters and they were incredible! Desert was also very very good. Very hip atmosphere. Super fun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it here! We had been wanting to try Buck & Rider when we first moved to Arizona- about 8 months ago, but never got the chance. My boyfriend's boss was in town for business so we decided to take him here with us for a fun dinner/drinks evening. We got a taste for two different entrees, two desserts (which, OF COURSE were shared family-style), and three drinks.   ATMOSPHERE: Upon entry, you'll notice that the floor plan is really open and roomy... And that there are freshly baked cookies for consumption. There is a table right between the bar and entrance where you can wait for your drink & appetizer order to be taken- which will then be brought to you before you're even seated at your table! This has become a trend in some of the newer restaurants in the area, which I absolutely love because there is nothing worse than standing around bored out of your mind waiting for a table to open up. It gives you and your dinner date/guest an opportunity to chat- and makes you forget all about the wait time! The bar actually doubles as a shellfish display, which was a nice little touch. Speaking of wait time: our reservation was originally for 7:30PM, however we arrived an hour earlier and they still accommodated us and had us seated way before our initial reservation time! There is also outdoor seating available, but probably scarce because the weather has been so nice lately.   APPETIZERS: We split three kinds of oysters with chilled shrimp, there weren't any oysters that I disliked! You could definitely tell that they were fresh- and they were not drained of their liquor (biggest pet peeve when you receive dry oysters- if an individual wants to drain their oyster, they can do so when it arrives at their table).  ENTREES: We went with the 8 oz center cut filet mignon and BBQ Pork Ribs for our entrees. No, we did not order anymore seafood, which I deeply regret now because everything was just SO GOOD, I can only imagine how great their seafood main dishes must be. The center cut filet was cooked to a medium rare- exceptional. Perfectly prepared, not to mention the wonderful smoky flavor and melt in your mouth quality of meat. When I tried to pick up the ribs, they fell apart immediately, CLEAN off of the bone so I guess you can say that they were cooked perfectly as well! Amazing flavor there too, complete with a kick of spice.  As a side for my ribs, I decided to order the fries (which was the only thing I did not like, as they were all too crispy.. but some people love crispy fries).  DRINKS: I was dressed in OTK boots, a mini skirt and a long sleeve shirt so I definitely had my sassy streak going on and decided that the best fitting preliminary drink for me would have been a glass of Rose. I ordered the Argyle Brut Rose which didn't disappoint (to say the least). I absolutely loved it and savored this through our oyster rounds. For our main entree(s), we shared a glass of the Absent Minded Professor, which paired really well with the filet.   DESSERT:  To finish our meal, we ordered a slice of lemon meringue pie and pumpkin pie. Both were great, it was my first time actually ever trying lemon meringue pie- it was very refreshing and the meringue was perfectly bruleed- giving the final after taste of charred sweetness.   Needless to say, I am definitely coming back and ordering a whole bottle of that Argyle Rose and  trying the seafood entrees!   -Outdoor seating available  -Happy Hour  -Great date night spot -Trendy"}
{"text":"Had a 5 Star lunch here. Their ceviche is fantastic. All their sushi and shrimp dishes were great. The service was very good.  I can't wait to go back there the next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Omg!! What a diamond in the rough - such a unique dining experience- the crisp critter oysters were AH-Maziing - I ordered the surf and turf and it was ON point!! The meat melted in my mouth like it was butter! Or wait - was that the lobster I was enjoying?!? Either way super impressed with the food and the service - Sofie really went out of her way to make my dinner incredible and had all the right suggestions. Somehow I made such an impression that the manager, I think her name was Laura , came to greet me and make sure everything was just right. Because of the attentive nature and friendly atmosphere I ended up staying a lil longer to have a few more drinks! Highly suggest this place not once not twice not three times - all the times"}
{"text":"We ate here recently while vacationing in Scottsdale and loved it. The ambiance is super fun and the decor is nicely done so that it creates an intimate yet fun vibe. We shared a bunch of things rather than having an entree. First thing were the dinner rolls - sounds boring but OMG, out of this world. Then the fried chicken appetizer which was fabulous - the perfect combo of crunch on the outside and juicy on the inside. We also shared a sushi roll - the lobster one. Very good. Drinks were perfect, I love a well made martini. This is a great place for Thurs-Sat night fun. I loved that they had Valet only, very convenient and nice not to have to worry about parking."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food never ceases to amaze. Definitely try the crab cakes and whoever makes those cookies with the salt at the entrance should get a Nobel prize!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The fish is same day fresh, outstanding service. I've been here 2-3 over the last couple years and I always leave happy. I don't eat a ton of seafood outside of the typical shrimp/salmon but when I do I go here. Honestly if I could give them 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"Oysters are great and priced reasonable.  Service, drinks, and everything I've tried there has been good."}
{"text":"Took my Tinder match there and let's just say I'll be taking all my Tinder matches. Great food nice environment. Fresh product."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! Went here for our anniversary and the food and oysters were amazing. Definitely unique and modern with lots of food options. Happy hour is all day until 7pm- you can only get the HH drinks in the dining room, not the food HH items-those you can only order in the bar. For dessert we had home made pistachio ice cream and a delish wheat-less chocolate cake- it was like pure rich cocoa. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Angelina was,our server and she was awesome. She was very attentive, answered all our questions, and was at the table about the right amount of time.  The food was good all around the table. I would be back, especially if the same crew helps us."}
{"text":"Posting here for Buck & Rider server Gabriella, or Gaby as she called herself.  She was very pleasant and spot on with menu item portion selections per our desire not to overorder as we had after dinner plans and didn't want a doggy bag.  She was very pleasant and attentive and that's what makes a great server.  Great job Gaby!  Food-wise B&R a very good.  We've dined there several times in the past and never disappointed.  $31 for my salmon that included a choice of side (I picked the stuffed baked potato) might have seemed a couple dollars too high but not complaining as everything my wife and I ordered was great.  All toll $133 before tip for one dozen oysters, two entrees (my wife ordered crab cakes), and two tap beers."}
{"text":"Great ribeye and great wine. The grouper came with spaghetti squash with mushroom very very good.. we had the 8 oysters from copps island CT VERY GOOD!! The Brussel sprouts were amazing with side of goat cheese. The shrimp bisque was smoky and very flavorful.. our waitress Sophie was very nice and laughs at our jokes. We love it here!!"}
{"text":"Sunday happy hour? Yes please! We have been here twice in two weeks. The oysters are always amazing. We have had the fish, lobster, steak, and ahi burger. All of it was fantastic."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites !!   Great oyster bar.  Really good cocktails !!   Service was amazingly fast.   Took our time ordering different courses but each time we ordered  the salads, oysters, and ceviche were on our table within literally minutes!  Really knowledgeable servers !!   Definitely going back !!  Happy hour until 7:00"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Saturday. Yeah, can you believe it? A happy hour on Saturday and it's from open to 7pm!!!!  They have half off oysters, cheap drinks, half off cocktails, and a good priced lobster. My only tiff is they don't serve cooked oysters. Grrrr I wish they did.  The food was delicious and looking at our ticket we got $56.00 off our order. MADNESS!!!   We are definitely coming back, maybe every weekend."}
{"text":"Wow this place is. gem. Best oysters i ever had. Best tequila sunrise i ever had. I only ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters and calamari. It was all percect. Even the french fries were.great! Staff was more than percect and.friendly. The girl behind the bar seemed new but was almost perfect at all times. Oysters and drinks were 1/2 off from 11-7. Bring a designated driver to really enjoy this place. I am looking forward to going back and having an entree."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow. The best food I have ever eaten in my life!. Great service, great environment, and amazing brussel sprous!"}
{"text":"MMM, I haven't had scallops this good since back home in Louisiana. Ya'll need to get down to BR and try it out. I had \"Your Money or Your Life\" to drink and the Bourbon took me waaay back. Good atmosphere on a Friday night and even better food!"}
{"text":"Great seafood and Phoenix aren't usually in the same sentence...however, it might be my  native Phoenician pallet talking here...this place is great! One of THEE best happy hours going...fair warning the Friday HH crowd is ruthless...as only the bar area is HH zone...bar stools are watched like Trump wished the border was...leave a seat and it's fair game...two to three deep is not uncommon..once however you have a golden ticket...enjoy. The seafood is unpretentious and amazing. Shockingly the brussel(?) sprouts are simply amazing. The service is great, they know they get their ass kicked during HH and do it with a smile. The vibe can get a little 'sea marketish' (see what I did there?)  as you do get some spillover douchbaggery; if that is your thing..great..if not, people can ignore the overtures of amazingness from such individuals.  The cocktails are also HH, which makes them taste all the more better...the best on the menu is YOUR MONEY or YOUR LIFE..a version of an old fashion w/Old Forrester bourbon..you just can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Food is good. Had the Halibut ceviche. Very fresh and lovely blending of flavor a. SPICEY though. Servers Joy and Ariana were great"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! My honey and I came here for New Year's Eve as a surprise! He was looking for somewhere new and hit the jackpot with B&R! We loved everything about this place - ambiance, service and most importantly, food! We started with dirty martinis with homemade blue cheese stuffed olives (excellent). For an appetizer we had the shrimp and chorizo skewers (fantastic!). For our entree we had the smoked trout salad (okay), blackened snapper (good) and side of crispy brussel sprouts (excellent!) the only reason for 4-stars and not 5 is the snapper was a little over cooked and salad was missing some zing. We told one of the servers (could have been a manager, not sure) this when he asked how everything was and he was very respectful and appreciative of our feedback. Our server was very good - she was Genuine, sweet and professional! They even had complementary salted chocolate chip cookies at the door on our way out. Can't wait to come back to B&R! I hope this new spot makes it, definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today after driving past a couple of times. We came looking for seafood. I recommend the west coast oysters and stone crab. Avacado toast was delicious. Cinnamon rolls were AMAZING, and I don't love sweets. Endless mimosas, yes, I said endless. With fresh grapefruit juice. We had a lovely inside/outside table. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best service with the best dishes, you really can't find a place with better seafood in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, Buck & Rider absolutely never disappoints! They have an incredible Happy Hour during the week and even on Saturdays until 7 PM in the bar area! Their Happy Hour includes 1/2 off the bar menu eats {this includes their raw bar!} and $6 cocktails and wine. They don't have a freezer on site an their seafood is flown in fresh daily. Seafood lovers - get here now!!  Their cocktails are amazing and have the most unique names! I always order One Night in Babylon because I love anything with gin + cucumber. It is so refreshing and I warn you, you'll suck this one down without even realizing it! I have to consciously 'sip' it!   For eats - we ordered their whole lobster from the raw bar - you guys, this too is half off!!!! Next, we ordered oysters, steak tartare {the best i've ever had in my life}, and the baja style seafood cocktail that has scallops, fresh crab, and shrimp! Holy heaven, the seafood cocktail is also the best i've ever had.   I honestly think that Buck & Rider is one of my favorite places in the Valley. They never disappoint and the Happy Hour really can't be beat for the quality and freshness of their food. See ya again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Very Hip & Swanky place! VALET ONLY!  Came on a Friday at 6:45 and they only have Valet Parking, so prepare yourself for that! There was a 45 minute wait to be seated, we were a party of two and actually waited 45 minutes as this was our first time!   Once we were seated, our waitress (Ariana)was very helpful and nice. We ordered four kinds of oysters, Kumamoto, Miyagi, Sun Hollow and Wellfleet. They were all very good. We tried the Thai Crab salad and it came with a very spicy dressing which I loved.  We also ordered the Brussel Sprouts, which were good but a bit too fried and it came with a warm goat cheese dip that I didn't care for so much.   Overall it was a nice experience, I didn't like the valet only parking, waiting 45 mins and it is a bit pricy. $180 for two people is a bit much for this to be a regular spot for me. They have a nice patio area and they offer cookies as you leave."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Arizona, and it's not even close. Come in and give it a try. Exactly what you've been looking for if you're a seafood fan."}
{"text":"good food here! defiantly a great happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for oysters and seafood. staff is very friendly and attentive. My mom had some oysters for appetizers and pasta trofie with shrimp. I had the crab cakes, and my brother had the new york strip. Vale parking is a plus also."}
{"text":"Hello.  Do you love happy hour? Do you love seafood? Do you love dimly lit corners and sparkling wine glasses?  Then you already love Buck & Rider.   Let me put it to you this way. If someone said: \"Hey, be friends with this person,\" and that person hated Buck & Rider, I'd have to say that person sounds horrid.    No one with good taste hates Buck & Rider.   So if you're reading this, and thinking I hated it -- you, you have bad taste. I'm sorry. On the plus side, this is something you can change about yourself.   In the words of Richard Gilmore: \"Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine at lunch.\"  Good thing happy hour starts at 4.   Bye."}
{"text":"Updated review 2/19/16 After my last review, the manager reached out and we connected via email. She apologized profusely, took ownership of the issues we encountered and invited us back with an incentive.  I was very impressed with her attitude. Last night we finally made it back. Once again, I hosted coworkers, a party of 6. Knowing they don't take reservations, we arrived early for what we expected to be a busy Friday night. They took us right to our table this time without the entire party on site.I took our hostess aside to give her the note from the manager and she knew who I was! Our last visit was in December. She promised us a great evening. Off to a great start. We enjoyed a couple of happy hour beverages while wearied for our guests.  This experience was much different -- our server, Angie, was very warm, on top of our needs, helpful, gracious -- all thing things I'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Although she mentioned that they used a team approach to service, I think she as the only one to work our table all night. Great job all evening, Angie,  The dining room is still pretty noisy but not nearly as loud as last time. One of my guests LOVES oysters and raved about the selection, freshness and flavor. We also got shrimp (knowing this time to order the count we wanted), calamari, and the dinner rolls.  For dinner, we had the loup de mer, halibut, chicken, fish Veracruz, salmon -- we ran the gamut of the menu! Everyone was so happy with their selections. The seafood is so fresh and flavorful. Our non-adventurous eater liked the chicken very much. Angie recommended the Sancerre white and we also got a bottle of the black chicken for the red drinkers. Everyone was too full for dessert but we lingered, laughed and never felt rushed.   While I'm sure they gave us a little extra attention because of our previous experience, I am still very impressed all the way around. Thank you for a very nice dinner and evening, Buck & Rider."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant on several occasions and I can say it works for both the young and trendy and older folks that prefer a more traditional menu. Gabi was our server and she was patient, attentive and sweet. Our entire table liked her a great deal. I had the halibut with a lemon and butter sauce and it was excellent. I also ordered the Frida Khalo speciality drink that was delicious. The desert was pistachio ice cream with some of their homemade cookies and it was yummy.   I rarely give five stars but this place really deserves it! Food, service and atmosphere all come together...."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The food was excellent. Modern decor with a good selection of cocktails. The seafood was fresh. The Brussel sprouts and the crab legs were my favorites. I really loved that the crab legs were pre cracked for me. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for reasonably priced yet tasty seafood in a hip lively atmosphere.  Be prepared to wait though, they don't take reservations. That's the only drawback for this spot."}
{"text":"Come for happy hour and stay for dinner. Amazing food, service, atmosphere and unique!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and wonderful service to match. The staff was very friendly and very attentive, we were as large group and we had a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Great Patio, good service and the food was excellent. Parking is tricky but otherwise, really enjoyed my birthday dinner there."}
{"text":"We are in town for vacation and found this place on yelp because we were in the mood for seafood. We loved it! Atmosphere very hip and trendy. Food was all fresh and delicious. I had a pasta with shrimp, sausage, kale, and almond pesto that was wonderful. My husband and parents all had fresh fish that they loved. Fresh roll appetizer was great comfort food. Cocktails were interesting and fun as well. Highly recommend. It's expensive but worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"I grew up \"off\" the Oregon Coast. The sea is a way of life there. Funny 28 yrs ago when I moved to CO I lost all taste for \"sea-food\". So glad this was my friends choice today. They have a raw bar. When you walk in the smells are like \"back home\". The crab legs are incredible. My sister & I (as little kids) used to drop our own baskets off the docks and take home crab for dinner. Brings back memories of the fish markets. The Shrimp Bisque has so much flavor  and if your not into seafood, thats cool too. The Chicken Sandwich is huge and you dont even want to say it's breaded, but I guess it is, but so lightly ~ Positively Divine. The staff is top notch. Joella is very attentive and makes the best recommendations!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Food is luscious.  Drinks are incredible.  The wait staff super attentive and nice.  Genuine.  I will be back the next time we are in Phoenix.  This place is up to the best standards."}
{"text":"The new \"it\" place in Phoenix Crab legs are terrific Corn bread is not as good as advertised I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great experience! I came here for the first time for their one year anniversary by recommendation from one of the bartenders at LGO. Arcadia is killing these days with new eats. I love the location and the views of Camelback Mtn from inside the restaurant. I'm not the biggest expert on eating seafood and the bartenders were great in giving me the lowdown  on how it all works. They had some great specials for their one year. I started off with one of their signature drinks - \"your money or your life\" (one of my favs over at LGO). Then my buddy and I split some oysters that were half off for the day. The oysters came with some choice toppings and went down smooth. Stone crab was in season and I snagged a claw for my first time. Despite being in the desert, these guys pride themselves on serving the freshest seafood that is flown in daily. We ended our day with a couple more drinks and the halibut ceviche that was nice and light and delicious. The manger checked on us and a couple servers greeted us as well. The customer service was definitely on display for their anniversary. They are building an outdoor patio bar that should create a fun outdoor dining experience. I have nothing but good things to say about this place and I'm still savoring that salted chocolate chip cookie they handed me as a walked out the door. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Waitress and service was 5 star. For the price-point the seafood was 2 star.   Most of appetizers in our large party were average and WAY overpriced for the quality and amount.   The B&R House version of an Old Fashion was FAR too sweet even after I ordered it half sweet. Missed the mark big time.   Wife had crab cakes for her main course and it was delightful. I had the Surf and Turf. The Filet was 5 star; great flavor and cooked exactly how I'd ordered it. The lobster however, not even average in quality or flavor. A Bostonian would have been embarrassed for that poor lobster.  Dessert was 5 star as well.   As a Frequent (weekly) Chelsea's Kitchen regular, it feels as if B&R tries too hard to take it to the top step, but misses the mark. Beautiful building inside and out. The ambiance is a little loud, even though it looks as if they've tried to address this with GIANT acoustic baffling hanging in the open-faced steel trusses in the ceiling.    Good luck B&R! Keep tweaking your menu and price-point! As an Arcadia resident we'd love to see you succeed!"}
{"text":"Very good place for sea food in phoenix. This city has been lacking on sea food front and this place did good job with selection of menu along with quality of food and service. Though we had a waiting of 30 minutes , staff was attentive and very endearing with their attitude !! Definitely coming back for good time with friends"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here and the HH was excellent. The price was great for their HH selections. The cocktails was ok. Definitely will come back on my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was amazing! Food, service and atmosphere. The fresh shrimp with cocktail sauce was the best EVER! And the LGO Caesar is hands down my favorite Caesar salad. We also had the surf and turf which was fantastic."}
{"text":"Welp... Buck & Rider, you've TOTALLY redeemed yourself! My first visit wasn't the absolute greatest, but I said I would give it another try... and this time around... wow, just wow. I was absolutely impressed -- not only by the food, but all around!    My boyfriend and I went in on Saturday night since he was craving seafood, and I had my fingers crossed that Buck & Rider wouldn't disappoint. We showed up around 8:30pm to a packed house, however we only waited maaaybe ten minutes for a seat to open up -- and it was in the bar area so we could take advantage of the amazing reverse happy hour -- yay! (We were a bit early, though, reverse happy hour doesn't start until 9:30pm). We were seated quickly, greeted by our amazing server, brought menus, water, and my boyfriend was given the \"welcome shpiel\" since it was his first time in.   I ordered the Ace in the Hole (I highly recommend if you like tequila!) It was light, fruity, and summery, although perfectly balanced and not overbearingly sweet.  For dinner, we decided to order a few different menu items and share so we could have a variety. We ordered the following:  * Baja Style Seafood Cocktail: Jumbo lump crab, shrimp, scallops, and tomato. Super yummy, although I ate all the crab and shrimp and then was only left with scallops... which are not my favorite, so I left those for my boyfriend, hehe. * Voodoo Fried Rice (My FAVORITE!): Fried rice with shrimp, organic chicken, peas, gojuchang (aka a red chili paste/sauce), and red fresnos. Think of a cross-over between jambalaya and fried rice. It was so delicious, and the flavors were phenomenal! I ordered another one so I could take home and enjoy the deliciousness the next day. Highly recommend!  * Sushi Grade White Fish Ceviche: avocado, cherry tomato, roasted sweet potato, fennel, and scallops. This was good too, although not my favorite so I only had a few bites -- it was a smidge too \"fishy\" for my liking, but then again, seafood tends to be \"fishy\", lol. * Crunchy Shrimp Roll: Roasted almonds, avocado, spicy mayo, and Serrano peppers. Delicious and different with the roasted almonds; the hint of that roasted almond flavor added extra pizazz to the roll. I would absolutely recommend it, and order it again on a future visit.   We also received tortilla chips and saltines with our food, although I'm not sure which ordered item they officially \"come with\".   The service was exceptional, and I was thoroughly impressed at how quickly the food came out -- I felt like we would barely place our order and next thing we knew, our food was on our table. The presentation of everything was extremely appetizing (see photos), and I assure you, everything was just as delicious and flavorful as it looked! Thank you, Buck & Rider -- the server, management, and staff that made our evening so wonderful! We'll see you again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, cute ambience. Definitely on par with the Arcadia neighborhood, but the food left me wanting more. I'm giving it a second chance and once I come back I'll edit my review."}
{"text":"Outstanding above and beyond service and dishes I'm still trying to recreate in my kitchen!  We were all so blown away that any meal we had the rest of our trip we compared to this one, and nobody topped it. Not only did our waitress and the chef go above and beyond but it was the best food we had that weekend.   On a recent trip to Arizona my mom and our friends came here for brunch. I've been a vegan almost 20 years and know my way around certain menus to order things that suit me and there's always the safe bet of a salad on the menu, though I had already been eating a lot of salads that weekend. Going to a seafood restaurant I was totally fine with just having a drink, enjoying conversation and eating something later instead of looking for ways to alter any current options to avoid meat, cheese, milk fish, eggs, etc.  Against my pleading to not ask, the women at my table all asked our waitress, Emma, about vegan options. It seemed like this was the first time she had ever been asked this question (not surprisingly) and had no idea what would be an item to suggest, she could have left it at that, but instead went back to the kitchen and talked to the chef and told us that he would be coming out to our table. I'm now thinking, oh goodness I don't want to be annoying and difficult, I'm fine with just having a drink.   Chef Greg came out and we were left totally impressed. I had no idea what I wanted but I didn't want him to go out of his way, because I get it, I'm a vegan, in a seafood restaurant, I don't except it to be a place where I'll find something. But he said he happened to have some tofu in the kitchen (seriously? what world am I in that a seafood restaurant happens to have tofu in the kitchen and that the chef knows how to prepare it?). He said he had me taken care of and would whip something up. We were all stunned that he was happy to make something not on the menu but then also just create something off the top of his head!? Then the food came out. Not just a main dish but he made an appetizer to end all appetizers, since everyone else at the table had ordered one.  It was a ceviche with tofu, mango, avocado, olive, red onion. cilantro(?), lime(?), (what else was in there? Come on chef Greg I need this recipe!) micro greens on top and it was the best dressing I've ever had. Later when Emma asked if she could take the bowl we all said \"No! We're still dipping thing into it!\" Haha. This was so amazing I've been trying to recreate it at home and really think this deserves to become an item on the menu. Sorry, not sorry if anyone tries to order this in the future. it was light, citrusy, refreshing and the dressing was liquid gold that everyone at the table couldn't get enough of and we pretty much licked the bowl clean.  The main dish was crunchy fried rice, charred tofu steak with veggies and presented like a 5 star restaurant. This was so good I took home the tiny bits I had left to have for a snack later.   Thank you Emma for giving so much concern to us and being so polite, lovely and accommodating and thinking on your feet when everyone at our table had so many questions! Thank you Chef Greg for blowing our socks off and ruining every other meal on our trip :) First time I've had a chef make something for me off menu and probably the last, until we stop by here again on our next trip..."}
{"text":"Overall was a really great experience. I have never been to Buck & Rider before and called on a whim Saturday afternoon to try and get in that evening. Those who answered the phone were friendly and accommodating letting me know reservations were full put they would put my table for 2 on a priority list. Made \"reservations\" for 7:30. Got there about 7:00 and the place is packed! Packed as in exciting and alive. The restaurant is such a cool concept, oyster bar, open kitchen, cool vibe. We decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited and were greeted promptly by the bartender even though we were standing to the side of the bar. Bar staff was kind enough to walk our drinks out to us instead of handing them over the people that were seated and got us our check quickly. There was a nice rail that we were able to stand at and not feel awkward and out of place as we were waiting for our table. The \"host\" (I don't even want to call them just a \"host\" as their job is so much more than just getting you to your table, I would call it a \"table seating expect!\") got us seated not far off from our \"reservation\" time in a nice cozy seat. Old Fashiones were great, they were out of the side dish that we ordered and the manager came up, apologized, ordered us a complimentary round of drinks and handled the situation with class and great customer service. Enjoyed some amazing scallops and pasta, we were greeted with a nice goodbye on the way out. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love me some Buck & Rider. My boyfriend and I frequent this place, especially during happy hour because you can't beat their happy hour prices. We went in during fourth of July, and it was happy hour all day. Which means their lobsters, ceviche, and their delicious oysters were super affordable. I was never a fan of oysters especially because it had made me sick when I was little however this place made me an oyster fan (I think that says a lot!)   Sushi was just okay in my opinion but that's because I prefer authentic Japanese sushi and I am kind of a sushi snob. My boyfriend however loves the california roll with real crab. I love their deviled crab dip, can't go wrong with that one. I hated the spicy tuna tostadas. I couldn't even get my boyfriend to finish it (my boyfriend who would eat just about anything with tuna). It just was NOT good. Their calamari was okay, nothing special, but cooked perfectly, not too chewy. I was not a fan of their seafood gumbo.   Anyway, if you are an oyster fan, you will LOVE this place! I am getting hungry just by typing this review!"}
{"text":"Go here for Sushi and drinks, was not impressed with  My Fish and Chips, very small portion and under cooked. Nice atmosphere, friendly environment.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Newly opened. Had some major struggles in the beginning getting a party of 7 seated. We waited for a long time... Almost 2 hours. But I will say it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Flown in fresh everyday the seafood is incredible. Ambience was really cool and so was the staff. Literally my most favorite restaurant in AZ. Kushi or kumamoto oysters are my ultimate favorite. The raw bar in general you can't go wrong with.  Wasn't disappointed and I've been a regular ever since."}
{"text":"After visiting this place many times now, I've come to the consensus it's more of a spot to take a date for drinks. The ambience is GREAT. Has a really cool modern, industrial vibe which I really like. Hate to say it, but every time I've tried the food I've been disappointed... Especially when considering the price. In my experience, this NOT a place where you walk away thinking, \"I got what I paid for.\" Unless, as previously stated, you just popped into the bar for a few drinks and moved on to the next place."}
{"text":"First off the atmosphere and customer service are great!  Great selection of  oysters!  The Brussel spouts were unique and fun to eat.  The Ahi Tuna Burger was really tasty and the Sea Bass was good as well.  We had ordered a sushi roll, but we were surprised to find that the soy sauce presented with the roll is actually a sauce they make in house that is pretty sour and some what off putting.  They also offer Rolls in the appetizer section which were similar to Hawaiian buns, sweet but good.  We had fun."}
{"text":"Buck and Rider is the best new place in town! I love seafood and their dishes really hit the spot. I have been a handful of times since they opened and I am NEVER disappointed! Today they were crazy busy as expected because their food is delicious and fresh. I have had the halibut, salmon, and many sushi rolls. You can tell how passionate the company is about providing quality service and food!   I believe the biggest part of a quality restaurant is the service they provide. Buck and Rider has phenomenal servers who love their jobs and the food they serve. I highly recommend Buck and Rider. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to crush on...so much that it was one of the top spots for my birthday week. Not only do I come here for dinner, I come for happy hour, and it's my weekend outing choice. You cannot go wrong with happy hour on Saturdays and dollar oysters. Everything is spectacular, especially the oysters, market fresh selection, desserts, and the forget-me-not home baked cookies by the hostess stand. Open your tastebuds with the brussels sprouts. Who would have thought of complimenting them with goat cheese? Uhmazing!!!! Also appetizer starlites are the pull apart bread, ceviche and fried chicken. Carb up! I've had the steak, chilean seabass and scallops as my top entree choices. I have eaten it all and can recommend anything to you.   Buck & Rider is great for birthdays, big parties, casual get togethers, and date nights. It can get loud during busy times, but what packed restaurant is not?!?! The patio is inviting as the bar to stay awhile. I love the energy and don't mind it much. It is intimately dark; hence no pictures...but that could be because I enjoyed the company and food too much! Valet parking is also available if you want to get to your food faster or that quick  get away when you claw grab a handful of those delish cookies!"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood. The salmon was so flavorful, probably the best I've ever had. My dad had the clam chowder and said the same about it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday with a few friends for my first time. The best oysters I have ever eaten! The meal was overall suburb!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Buck and Rider last to celebrate my birthday.  Was sooo disappointed that they were out of the Loup De Mer!!! My husbands and my favorite menu item!!  He had the scallops instead and I had a roll and a salad.  Great atmosphere.  Please don't run out of your best menu item!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch! Especially Mother's Day brunch! Lots of oysters, shell fish and great craft cocktails. This place is a must for a great casual  Sunday!   There is a open air patio, outdoor bar and lots more! Ask for Samantha, she is an amazing server with a great attitude!"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting Buck & Rider we arrived at 10:15 pm on a Saturday night.  Even though we were arriving close to their closing time we never felt rushed.  From the valet to the person at the host stand to our wonderful bartender Sydni, everyone met us with a smile.  We were happy to see that they had a reverse happy hour, Syndi detailed their house wine for us and we truly enjoyed the choice.  We decided to order a couple of smaller dishes, the fried calamari, and Vodoo Fried Rice, both were quite good.   Cannot wait to come back when we have a little bit more time to try the raw bar and grab a seat on the outdoor patio.  We really cannot say enough good things about Sydni, she has such a wonderful approach to people and a great knowledge of the menu."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant! The food is delicious, the raw bar is amazing, and the service is great! Get a drink at the bar while you wait for a table and chat with the fun and friendly bartenders and management team. Buck & Rider is our new favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"I had expectations of a fabulous meal but in all fairness I should rate it just as restaurant. This place is average at best. For the money stay home.  I just left few minutes ago.  Waitress out to lunch.   Salmon good not excellent.  Calamari really good  Brussels sprouts = played out. Soggy Baked potato good.  Mahal mahal blacked was salty as a hell and ruined the meal.  Martini average  Wine excellent"}
{"text":"Babe and I enjoyed a mellow evening dinner during their soft opening. It is evident that the owners are doing a \"throw down\" to The Henry and Steak 44. Decor definitely encourages you to linger and fresh oyster options pull in memories of Grand Central's Oyster Bar. Staff was attentive but the multiple staff leaves no one accountable for a drink refill.  I enjoyed the very cold steak tartare with exception; the presentation could be improved. Babe had the halibut and it was nicely done for his taste. Drinks were reasonable but the two namesake cocktails left me with regrets the next morn.   We are eager to try the remaining menu and welcome LGO's competition to the corner! (However I will be staying away from the Rittenhouse rye.)"}
{"text":"Buck &Rider is the new hot spot in Phoenix. My favorite menu items include the crab and macadamia sushi roll, the fresh pull apart dinner rolls, the Alaskan King crab legs and the pan seared scallops. Fresh fish and shellfish can be purchased to pick up for a delicious home-cooked meal. Sundays are a deal as they offer half off their bottles of wine and select sushi rolls. If it's a beautiful evening, you should sit on the patio. This is a must try seafood house!"}
{"text":"Just had another FANTASTIC meal at Buck & Rider! Thank you to Laura for all your help once again!!  Thank you Chef, the lobster was amazing!! My server Angelina thank you thank you thank you!! IMPECCABLE service!! EVERYTHING was SPOT ON!! I'm a resident of Scottsdale and have been to Buck & Rider multiple times and will be back many many more! If you want the BEST seafood in Phoenix come to Buck & Rider. If you DON'T then go elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"Very good Eggs Benedict at brunch.  Service was good. The dinners are also very good - tried the crab cakes, halibut and sushi."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. Every place these people open up never fails to impress me! Although Buck and Rider is on the more spendy end of their restuarants, it is higher-end dining, and to be expected with seafood.  Fresh ingredients, delicious drinks, wonderful service, and if you make it in during happy hour - great prices too! I will continue to recommend this place to anyone looking for a new spot to try!"}
{"text":"Solid eatery overall. Very good service and food choices. My only small complaint is that the oysters are tiny. They look like the rejects after more upscale restaurants pick the best from the box. Have eaten dinner and brunch here. Liked the brunch better, more of a relaxed atmosphere. +1 for Tesla charging!"}
{"text":"I called ahead of time and they said it would be a 10 minute wait.  We got there and then they said 20 minutes.  After 50 minutes of waiting with my 10 year old daughter, and after several times of asking how much longer (and each time they asked me again what my name is), we decided to go.  Finally our table was ready.  Service was terrible.  We asked for things and never got them.  Got the wrong food. The stone crab was just edible.  The sushi was so so.  And the servers seemed put out by a mother and daughter.  Guess they didn't see us as a high ticket order. I'll never come back.  And I dont recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! New favorite Sunday spot. We always like to dine at the bar and this staff does not disappoint. Friendly, fun and classy crew. Five stars  Best kusshi s in the valley."}
{"text":"Ok yall. I've now had the sea bass, the scallops, the crab cakes, the pasta and nearly every appetizer. I know, you're jealous and slightly disgusted. But chill, it's over the course of months.  We come here w new friends every time so we can keep going back, purposefully. Lol.  It's all good. ALL OF IT. I take that back. I didn't lurve the crab salad. It wasn't bad, just not dreamy. Dreamy. Speaking of that, let's talk about the lemon pie at the end. The crust. Yes. The filling. Yes. The meringue, which I've never liked in my life. Yassssssssssss.  Srsly. This place is yum. And the folks there are not jerks. In fact, each server we've had has treated us so well and been super helpful.  In all, one of my faves. Thx buck and rider for making my restaurant suggestions make me look like I know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"As someone who lives in the neighborhood, I have been to every restaurant around the bubble. When Buck & Rider opened I was so excited to have a new place to go. And they have NOT disappointed me! First off, the service is fantastic. The food is even better. Always fresh, always on point. If you're coming here for your first time, or even if you have been here and not tried this... The Lobster Roll \"Nik Niks\" are where it's at. Do yourself a favor and get an order, (if you're with more than one other person, get two because you'll for sure want your own.) The Radio Milano Pasta Troife is probably one of my favorite dishes and it's perfect for sharing. I will say that their seafood is probably the freshest in the area. Never frozen, always amazing.   Now as for the staff- they make you feel like you are just coming to see an old friend and they never leave you hanging!   The ONLY thing that I find odd is that I have to pay more for the \"pull-a-part dinner rolls\" than I do for my happy hour cocktail. Which just says that their happy hour is just as good as their dinner rolls.   Other than that, they're killing it over their. Keep up the good work Buck & Rider! Don't forget to take a cookie at the door!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food, decor, location and service all very good."}
{"text":"Bob Lynn has scored yet another home run Buck and Rider is great  The 1/2 shell oyster fresh cold and you would think you were sitting at the beach they are that fresh do yourself a favor go to Buck and Rider!!"}
{"text":"Last Night, Saturday 6/17/2017 at 6pm-9:30pm  I needed to let you know this. Last Night I took my date to your place for oysters. They were delicious...we had a dozen Blues.  Then we ordered the Caesar Salad with Salmon. The salmon was tasteless and had no consistency or firmness. It was obviously Farm Raised. I verified that with the waitress and she confirmed it was Farm Raised.  We couldn't finish it so we ordered the Calamari, which I had heard was quit good.  Well it had a smell that wasn't appealing at all and the oil it was cooked in was old smelling and they were very greasy. so the waitress said she talked to the manager and she was adjusting the calamari and salad OFF the bill. Then we ordered the Lemon pie...it was so runny and it was in 3 separate piles when we finally got it delivered. Our waitress apologized for everything as she too noticed what we had noticed.  So I get the bill and paid it....now in the car I noticed it was $66.00+ dollars...but not itemized, so I can't believe $66.00 for 12 Blues?....all we had was Sparkling water, no drinks to ruin our pallets.    It was recommended by our business attorney and others that you had the best oysters, and this was spot on...but the rest is something I need to reconsider before I reach out to my friends and and associates and let them know how it was.    I just don't understand, the place wasn't busy at all and plenty of servers standing around....but the food wasn't anything to rave about only awful. There were also employees sitting next to us and across from us. I could tell as they ordered things from the wait staff, they were obviously having some challenges as it seemed like a meeting of sorts and had on their server aprons and serious faces....what a class act....NOT.  My date was a business investor from Greece with limited English at hand and had gone on-line and taken snapshots of some of your entrees so she could show the waitress what she wanted but the waitress said on 3 of the items that she was shown that \"we don't have that anymore\"...so this was also disturbing....what's the point....who discontinues an avocado salad with salmon......pretty simple request.  Can you help me understand?.....The bar was hopping until the happy hour ended.  I was truly embarrassed.  Thanks  Kim"}
{"text":"We ate here for my husbands 30th birthday. It's definitely a good spot for a special occasion. I thought our food was really good although a little overpriced. We sat in the bar for happy hour and the drinks are a great deal. HH is from 11-7 Monday thru Friday. We also ordered the snapper ceviche and spicy tuna roll off the HH Menu. The ceviche was super fresh and the roll was one of my favorite things. We also tried the calamari which was fine but didn't blow me away. My husband got the ny strip which was definitely Overpriced for what he got. I got the ahi tuna burger and loved it. I would definitely go back for more sushi or the ahi burger. They have a Sunday night sushi and wine special that I want to try. Overall I would probably go back but only when I don't mind spending more for a special occasion or with out of town company."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times at this point after having moved here from across the country. It's such a great place over all - ambiance from inside to outside patio is very well thought. There is a bar on the patio as well as inside and if you're lucky enough to get Christin. The bar tender, you will not be disappointed esp if you are a cocktail lover. First amazing part of the night was that they have a late night happy hour starting at 930 until close on Saturday (probably the full weekend but I was only there Saturday). Not only was he easy to chat with, he was trying all kinds of cocktails and sharing with the people sitting at the bar.   Final touch and one of my favorites are the LGO chocolate chip salted cookies that are the best treat to grab on the way out (also the way in). All staff have been very kind and we've never ordered bad on the menu."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to be invited for their \"dress rehearsal\" before their official opening!  Our party of two was invited to enjoy two appetizers, two entrees and dessert.  We started with a real crab california roll and the shrimp and chorizo skewers - yummy!  For our entrees, we enjoyed the pasta and the crab cakes - again, very tasty and flavorful.  For dessert, we enjoyed the lemon meringue pie and the four layer chocolate cake - sinfully good!  The food was fantastic, the atmosphere is really nice and sure to be the next \"it\" dinner spot in Phoenix and the service was fantastic - especially since it was just dress rehearsals.  Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"LGO! YOU never disappoint ! Oh how I wish I stilled lived next to all things LGO. But oh well. Days like this, we were in my old neighborhood and I pulled my handy-dandy bookmarks up and voila! Buck & Rider appears! Buck & Rider has a crazy definition to it in the ocean world of crustaceans. I am not sure that this is the place to explain said definition. But the name is catchy! Buck & Rider brings LGO to the next level of swank. A little fancier than Chelsea's Kitchen and putting the spin on fresh seafood in the beauty of Arcadia. The inspiration for the cute building the restaurant is housed in is from a beach house from a swanky beach town in Australia. Walking through the restaurant to the patio, the raw bar is centrally located and for being lunch on a Wednesday, Buck & Rider was busy! Yay for complimentary valet! For being a relatively new restaurant, you can't tell. Our everything was on point! We were seated on the patio on a great spring Arizona day. The patio is prime spot for a view of Camelback Mountain across Camelback Road. You do not get the perfect view of the mountain, as there is traffic from the street, but you do still have a great view from the patio. I can see this being where the Biltmore/Arcadia pretty people go in the evenings ! Our cordial waitress explained everything from the All Day Happy Hour till 700pm!!! $6 cocktails!  (Oh how I wish.. but it was only lunch time and we had to be responsible) to Abby's Oyster Bar offerings. Lots of half priced oysters and raw bar items to choose from! Buck & Rider makes sure to notate on their menu that the seafood is fresh and flown in daily. I can not tell you how many times I have put my nose in the air about seafood that claims to be 'fresh' for the mere fact that we are in the desert and I just don't believe the 'fresh' claim. This was fresh. Very fresh. We started with the Crab & Macadamia Roll; a perfect bit of crunch from the macadamia nuts housed in this crab roll with asparagus and the perfect amount of shiso remoulade make it nice, fresh and just a little kick. It was nice to get a sushi roll that you don't see everywhere else as a starter. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Thai Style King Crab Salad. This salad comes with a generous portion of FRESH crab! There is also avocado, yummy mango, cilantro, over thinly cut lettuce. The vinaigrette is also a cilantro and I had that served on the side; it gives the salad a kick! You honestly could eat this salad with no dressing at all and it would taste very good. I had the nuts held and I added on a couple of grilled shrimp at $3 a pop. It was worth every.single.bite. This salad was fresh, healthy and filling! There is an amazing looking Lemon Meringue Pie on the menu and from the pics from my fellow Yelpers, I have to come back and try it. Today was not the day, so says my OTF trainer! This is a welcome addition for seafood and swank in the neighborhood! I can't wait to come back to Buck and Ride...er oh wait. No. Come back to Buck & Rider. Yes. That's it. Thanks LGO again for amazing-ness!"}
{"text":"First thing I have to say about Buck & Rider is that their customer service is bar none. They will do whatever it takes to make sure you leave the restaurant happy.  Some of the food can be spicy - if that is an issue for you, make sure to check with the server and pick your entree accordingly :)"}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience!! I know that there are great reviews for this restaurant,  however LGO truly missed the mark on this place.   We Love Chelsea's kitchen and really loved their old restaurant Radio Milano, but buck and rider was terrible. The food was awful including the lobster and the service was horrendous!!!   If they want to know what good service and good seafood is all about they need to visit the East Coast.   Although the management tried to make it up to us, we will definitely not come back here! Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"In one word? CHARMING. Charming approach. Charming patio. Charming staff - pleasant, friendly, efficient.  The menu is...dare I say it? Charming!  The selections in each category are just \"different\" enough to pique your interest but not require a food dictionary to decode.   I have but one regret: I did not bring enough friends to justify ordering One Of Everything!  Smoked Trout Salad was excellent with nice flavors, textures and visual presentation.  The dressing complemented it without taking over.  The Crab Dip was GREAT but next time I will skip the gluten free crackers (have a new appreciation for why some people people in my life who eat gluten free are so cranky - their food choices are weird!!! that would make me cranky too...). Coming back soon with reinforcements - this is PATIO season and should be enjoyed in charming locations like Buck & Rider."}
{"text":"yum yum yum!  immediately greeted upon walking into the front door. Sat ourselves at a high top table for HH.   deliciousness: crab dip, Baja seafood cocktail, and oysters! and all half off! oh, and the cocktails are yummy! if you like the old fashion style, go with the Your Money or Your Life! About Charlie includes vodka and early grey, which hit the spot! smooth yet potent!  skip: fried chicken. good but outshined by the above mentioned deliciousness :-)  grab a chocolate chip salted caramel cookie on the way out... on the house!  Def coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Buck & Rider blew my fish loving socks off. I have a hard time believing this place is in the desert. We started out with oysters, we had one of each. I would go with either the Buck & Rider or the crispy critter. Both amazing! For my entree I got the crab cakes. They were amazing! Everyone at the table wanted to try them. Overall the experience was one I would love to have again. Next time I would try the pull apart rolls."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped her for a drink and appetizer before heading to the next stop for dinner.  We were greeted immediately and were able to find a spot at the bar on the patio.   They have a great happy hour - which goes all day until 7pm with $6 cocktails as well as other drinks available.   The bartender was friendly and gave us some assistance in finding the right drink.  We also ordered a ceviche appetizer which was very good.  We would like to come back to try the fully dinner menu."}
{"text":"After dining here a 3rd time, there is still no improvement from my first review. It's just a bad menu and overpriced."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Arcadia area. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we loved the decor and atmosphere. I just hate how happy hour is always only in the bar area and not the surrounding tables - it gets me so mad! Why even have a Happy Hour!  Ordered a Diego Rivera cocktail to start off the night and was pleasantly surprised with this drink, it was fruitful for a tequila drink and highly recommend to y'all.  We started with a we Soup of the day which was a corn crab bisque, the soup had a smokey flavor and was tasty.  We felt we needed to try a sushi roll so we went with the Real crab California roll, which was good - nothing special. Other dishes we ordered was the Salt and Pepper crispy calamari, also just good.  The crispy Brussels Sprouts was most likely our best dish.  The goat cheese dipping sauce on the side added a different kick to these and were delicious!  Can't wait to return for another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time.  Service and food was great.   I loved the oysters and the happy hour was pretty good as well.  My wife ordered sea bass and it was amazing. My wife and I enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, incredibly fresh seafood, and cooked perfectly. My companion had the Radio Milano pasta and gave me a bite. I've never had shrimp prepared so perfectly. Tender, not at all chew, wonderful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fabulous from the moment you walk in. Very friendly staff and decor is wonderful. Menu is full of fabulous choices. The crab was delicious, lobster to die for, oysters so very fresh.  My 8oz filet I could cut with a fork and melted in my mouth. My husbands pan fried scallops were just so delicious. You must try this rest!!!"}
{"text":"It's taken me too long to review this restaurant!! After dozens of visits, the service, freshness of the seafood and quality of the entrees blows me away every time. I always start with a selection of oysters from their raw bar and a craft cocktail (their ice cubes in the stirred cocktails are crystal clear to the point they disappear!) then share some sort of surf and turf combination with the wife.  We also really enjoy their brunch! We always get a Crab Benedict and French Toast to satisfy our seafood and sweet breakfast cravings. 5 stars every time, great job!"}
{"text":"Best Crispy Brussels Sprouts in the world!!! And their Deviled Crab Dip was tasty with a kick to it, as were the Spicy Avocado Rolls. I was definitely a fan of the menu, but I would otherwise not have known that they were a seafood eatery. The setting and decor don't compliment the theme, but that's just me nitpicking. I had the B&R Filet, with a celery root purée and haricot vert. Was not awed, the filet quality was fine, more rare than what I ordered, medium rare, and simply had no flavor. I did have a bite of the Hong Kong Style Halibut and it was absolutely delectable! Would definitely get that the second time around. All foods were presented well and timely, and I fell in love with their Diego Rivera drink. Frida Kahlo Blanco Tequila, grapefruit and fresh thyme, so refreshing!!! Their lunch menu looks enticing, will have to drop in for it."}
{"text":"I am in love with Buck and Rider! I have lived in the Phoenix area on and off for more than 10 years now with a lot of travel in between and this is now my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! The oysters were clean, cold, fresh and delicious! Everything from the French omelette to the mussels,salmon, and fresh lobster were all great! The wait staff is so impressive...a shout out to Samantha who took our visit there to a high level of professional and comfortable service! I can highly recommend Buck and Rider...thank you :)"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a few friends and decided to get a table during happy hour. I started out with the Steak Tartare. It was fantastic, although I would get the toast without the butter on it next time, took away from how good the meat is. I also tried a couple sushi rolls, the crunchy shrimp and spicy tuna. Very familiar tasting but you could tell the fish was fresh! My waitress was a little blonde woman named Savannah, she was prompt, attentive, and had a wealth of knowledge to offer me about their menu. I will absolutely be back between the great food and amazing service!"}
{"text":"They really did it right when the developed Buck & Rider.  The layout is great (it's like three restaurants in one) with dining, the patio and bar all different experiences and not on top of one another.  The menu has something for everyone and it's not like every, other, restaurant, with a kale salad and cedar-plank salmon.  And the atmosphere is lively.  If you have out-of-town guests and you live in the neighborhood you would be well served to take them there."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. After reading the yelp reviews and the high ratings I expected more. The mussels were gritty, and overwhelmed by Serrano chili and chorizo. The trout was over coated with a thick tasteless material , but worst was way overdone and dry. The crab cakes were not as good as what you can buy at Costco.  The high raters must not have much experience With quality seafood! Won't be going back. Jm"}
{"text":"Tip #1 - come early to get a seat at the bar for their awesome happy hour.  Although it lasts until 7PM, good luck getting a seat after 5PM.  LGO has created yet another fantastic restaurant.  We've been twice; excellent service, knowledgeable staff, interesting cocktails, fantastic food.  Our favorites from the menu: -AMAZING brussel sprouts -sushi grade ahi tuna burger -steak tartare! -excellent salmon -fantastic dinner rolls  Don't forget to grab a sea salt chocolate chip cookie on your way out the door!"}
{"text":"One of the most epic meals I've had in Phoenix  since moving here! Stone crab claws as good as Joe's in Florida, ultra fresh shrimp, 4 types of oysters shucked perfectly.  We also loved the mini lobster roll. It was executed as well as any Michelin restaurant.  Also loved the cocktail program, the flavors were well balanced and unexpected.  The Aunt Charlie with its mix of tea and honey lemon is a must. LGO has something really special here!   It seems they've managed to bring the feel of a really good coastal restaurant to the middle of the desert. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the place you want to be. The staff is professional, the decor is comfortable, and the food is amazing! I sat at the bar and enjoyed crab rolls with macadamia nuts- so yummy. Lobster rolls on homemade rolls....garlic, butter... Oh my. Kim was my bartender and she did an excellent job of making recommendations. She was professional and friendly, and she obviously enjoys working there. I didn't have an entree but I just had to have some of the lemon meringue pie, with Italian meringue. In case you think you might not have room for pie, maybe everyone should start with that! Lovely evening for sure."}
{"text":"Came in last Sunday night to check out the wine and sushi discount they offer and can't wait to come back in for dinner! Sat at the bar and our bartender Megan was great! Super friendly, attentive and really seemed to know her stuff. The decor and ambiance were perfect. This a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"we had a great lunch! I don't know what exactly the sauce on the Brussels sprouts was made of, but I do know that I want to bathe in it. It was so good, especially with the warm goat cheese for dipping. We also got the crab dip with fresh made brown butter crackers (wish there were more) and the Thai style crab salad. Split all 3 and the two of us were happy and full as could be! Have to come back for some cocktails."}
{"text":"This was a great place,  nice atmosphere very open. large bar, with plenty of top shelf choices . fresh seafood was excellent the drinks were mixed correctly our bartenders name was Zach he knew a lot about his spirits and he shared joyfully. The seating was very comfortable location was excellent variety of menu very good seafood fresh other options were available. Nice outside patio in the front. Also noticed they had a fireplace so for those  cool winter nights. The only negative was one staff member  had a tank top on .  my thought I really don't want to see armpits when I'm dining. The oyster Schuckers and cooks seemed very professional and busy they had an open type kitchen where you could see all the action I really enjoyed this. If it was not for the one lady who had a tank top on I would've given this restaurant at five. Cost I would say would be considered as expensive as we rate it here but worth it."}
{"text":"This is one MY of my favorite seafood restaurants. The food is so fresh and the menu always fills your appetite, it's expensive yes, because all the ingredients are fresh and fly in on a daily base, which gives the flavors extra extra extra flavor! To be honest, it's a date night or a fancy dinner event other than that, I don't recommend if you go on a daily base. Here is some of what I ordered as a \"Dinner Date\""}
{"text":"First time here and came on the recommendation of a friend, they were spot on. Had a bunch of oysters and shared the wedge Louie salad, all was extremely delicious! I wish lived closer to have that salad all the time. The staff was very nice and the place was very clean, I cannot complain about a single thing. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will be back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Fresh oysters and great selection of seafood and wines!  My favorite were the blue points.  A great happy hour and the dinner is even better. Great salads with fresh ingredients.  The only recommendation would be a better wine selection by the glass but other than that, definitely worth the stop and will become a regular drop in for you."}
{"text":"DiMarco and gang have created a Lovely Atmosphere at buck & Rider on camelback but the Food ( primarily seafood) was average at best. And the service was tremendously sub par. We were there on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly crowded, although there was no wait . No reservations taken. Sitting at a table for 2 we found ourselves straining our voices  just to hear each other. Very Noisy beyond ability to have normal conversation . But my biggest complaint is value for the price. $20 for one crab claw??!!! $17 for a glass of Anderson valley Chardonnay ! Come on ?! Bill for dinner for 2 with one glass of wine each was almost $200!!  Much better places, for better value elsewhere ."}
{"text":"The music was soooo loud you couldn't visit with your dinner guests. I would recommend the outside patio. We were not impressed with our scallops, they still had sand in them. They put salt in the chocolate chip cookies....yuke! We will not be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Ambience and raw bar was great, but seafood is better at Chelsea's. Halibut was dry; trout and snapper were all sauce."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, all-around great spot! Each time I go, it keeps getting better and better. Andre the Manager is awesome, he makes every experience extremely pleasant from start to finish, cannot wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Dama at the bar is the sweetest! My husband and I had such great dinner & drinks . It's rare to get this great service in this area and we absolutely loved it! We will be back - the patio is so great here!"}
{"text":"Who knew you could get great seafood in Phoenix?! There are so many amazing choices, everyone in your group is sure to find their happy place. Don't forget the cocktails, either. So delish! Desserts are unbelievable. You MUST see for yourself. Head to Camelback now!"}
{"text":"I came in to have a beer and ended up having five drinks, a delicious sushi-roll, and an additional cocktail to cap. All of this was absolutely due to an awesome level of engagement from both Courtney and Christian. Courtney was helpful, fun and attentive. Because of her input, I not only had a few extra drinks but also an entree. Christian's enthusiasm and knowledge persuaded me to try a rye whiskey based drink called a Sazerac. As a person who doesn't drink whiskey, this absolutely means that his input was the driving force behind my doing so. I will absolutely be back and hope to be greeted by at least one of these awesome people because they made the experience. Separate of these individuals, the environment was great and the happy hour is, in my opinion, the best value in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal to share with a loved one. Great interior and ambiance, and TREMENDOUS food!! I highly recommend them Brussels sprout appetizer.   The good & wine were awesome too. The fish was FRESH!    My one criticism would be to have a little better more creative dessert menu. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Great seafood in Phoenix is far and few between. Buck and Rider has great seafood and sushi but I have yet to have anything else on the menu that tickles my fancy. So far I've tried the crunchy shrimp roll, pink moon oysters, and lobster which were all 5 stars but I've been disappointed by every non seafood item I've tried here. Fried rice was salty, avocado toast was basic, and the Brussels sprouts didn't impress me either. So far it's a love hate relationship because I really love seafood but I hate the non seafood items on the menu and they don't serve lobster rolls which is mind boggling."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!!! Best oyster selection in town. Happy hour is Monday thru Sat 11 to 7. You get oysters half off! Yummmmm service is great. Jonathan is part of the management team and he is the best. Always takes a min to check on us and say hi. Goes above and beyond. I love everything about buck and rider and can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I had Sunday brunch here this last weekend.  We've had brunch there once before.  Both times we decided to sit at the bar so we could watch whatever sporting event was on, and be a little bit out of the way.  We love their special Greyhound cocktail (with gun) so of course we had to start the process of figuring out what to eat while enjoying one of those.  They have an excellent raw bar at Buck and Rider.  We ordered a Dungeness crab cocktail and my husband ordered three oysters from the pacific NW.  The cocktail sauce knocks your socks off and is delicious.  The crab was fresh and really tasty as well.  The oysters were a little to big for my liking so I'll have to defer to his assessment that they too were fresh and delicious.  For our main meal we shared their delicious hash brown potatoes, served golden brown and oven hot in a cast iron pan.  They were deliciously crunchy but moist, and had a large dollop of sour cream and chives on top.  Yum!!  We also shared a French omelet which is clearly large enough to share, and comes with a cool crispy and tangy salad on the side.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough gruyere in the omelet.  I actually had a hard time tasting it.  Overall however, this is rapidly becoming our favorite Sunday morning spot.  I highly recommend the experience."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this beautiful restaurant. My husband and I ordered the brussels sprouts, the chicken tenders, crabcakes which were $28 for two of them, and lobster bisque. I was excited to try the new restaurant but I have to say it was nothing but a disappointment. The food was bland, nothing made me feel like I would ever come back. Service was fine but the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, food & service. Did I mention the French fries? Some of the best ever! Crab cake's are divine. Can't wait to get back in town to go again!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious ! My filet was amazing and juicy! Oh and the vegetables with it were perfect ! Not many good appetizers here so I didn't have any but the main course was good. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The initial waiter told us the wrong steak when he delivered it though. The ambiance is incredible so please get dressed nice to come here: I was tacky and wore flip flops"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Great food and great drinks. The oysters were awesome!"}
{"text":"A slick and well executed production, the type of thing we've come to expect from the likes of Fox, Upward Projects, and LGO.  The interior is so well done that I almost forgive them for razing a perfectly fine existing building to construct the current restaurant.    Everything consumed was fresh, flavorful, and each item had a nice twist that distinguished it from normal expectations.  The highlights were the brussels sprouts with goat cheese and the crab cakes.  The lobster roll was very good as well but I am deducting points because it was bite sized.  The redfish had a mild meaty flavor and the seasoning complemented it nicely with an appropriate kick.  All in all a good experience.  Another trendy spot in the trendy part of town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour and it turned into a full fledged meal. Started with a dozen assorted oysters, each one very fresh and clean. Followed that with white fish ceviche, extremely flavorful. Next up came the smoked trout salad, loved the dressing and inclusion of fennel. To finish off the meal, a whole lobster, sweet and delicious. Of course we had a couple of the specialty cocktails to accompany our tasting. This was a perfect way to experiment a variety and share plates. Our server, Samantha, was knowledgeable and pleasant. Go and reward yourself. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Came in to see my friend Nicole who works here.  Two words: awesome possum.  Had a bourbon cocktail that was perfect, came out in two minutes flat.  The steak sandwich was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the salt and vinegar chips were to die for.  All of the server staff was very friendly...  And attractive to boot.  The decor was tasteful and elegant.  I'll definitely be back, with friends too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I love the atmosphere. There's a cute patio. The service is good. You can go dressy or casual. They have great cocktails. The seafood is delicious. It's rare to find a place with great oysters in Phoenix. You don't need to be into seafood to love this place. The steak is one of the best I've ever had. They have great dessert. It's a great spot for brunch, dinner, a family meal, or client business meeting. I love everything about it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had dinner here last night and overall great experience- will be back!  I like the decor - hard to describe by eclectic and clubby cozy at the same time. I loved my cocktail - the something Babylon - which has spiced gin and za'tar for a super refreshing, super unique drink.  One of my only two complaints was the price of the gulf shrimp from the raw bar ($3.00 each) when I remember gorging myself on local shrimp in the Keys far about 13.00 a lb. Anyhoo, of course we are not in the Keys, we're in scorching landlocked Phoenix, so what should I expect. Maybe a price break if you order by the half or full dozen?  They were fresh, sweet and delicious along with a zesty, spicy cocktail sauce. Hubby enjoyed some oysters which I had to miss out on due to allergy. When I told our server about my oyster allergy she was very conscientious about it and clearly took extra steps to keep our orders separate.   We shared the Thai crab salad noted by other reviewers- tasty, fresh and light. We also shared the Brussels sprouts which I will now dream about  - the apple gastric is a delicious and unique touch. Finally, we split the crab cakes which had essentially zero filler - all crab meat - and came with a nice side salad of shaved French radish, asparagus and red onion. The Dijon buerre blanc was very rich - maybe on the side next time...   My only other complaint was the noise level. It was super loud in there - so not the place if you are seeking a spot for intense conversation, otherwise- great seafood, great service and overall thumbs up."}
{"text":"We revisited Buck and Ryder once again, and everything was perfect this time around. The ambiance, the food, and even our waitress! She was much nicer and even smiled. We enjoyed the mussels, scallops, and filet!"}
{"text":"Very cool place!   Atmosphere was very relaxed and warm.  Food was amazing across the board!   Service was 10/10 without a doubt.  Recommended for dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner with high expectations and they did not disappoint. Whatsoever. It's honestly difficult to find something that's not exceptional on this menu. I ordered the clam spago that was on special and was absolutely mind blown, whereas he ordered the Halibut that I tried and the only word he had to describe it was \"phenomenal\".   Awesome service, great ambience and awesome views of Camelback.   10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Was mediocre, better places around. I had the chicken and it was dry, the dessert was great"}
{"text":"We came to this spot for Mother's Day and would DEF come back! The chef and bartenders were top notch, and the atmosphere was perfect. Was totally diggin the Leon Bridges Pandora station. Our waitress, Marley, was nice and knowledgeable about the dishes and company.   The only con was the runners and bussers could use more training. We ordered sushi and did not get soy bowls. Our finished appetizer plates stayed on the table until we mentioned it, after our entrees came. The post dinner coffee came with milk and no spoons. Just the little details that make a restaurant feel more put together were missing.   HIGHLY recommend for their food, drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is A wonderful restaurant. They have a great happy hour. Love going in for a pound of crab legs and a nice glass of wine. Their Bok Choi Halibut wonderful. They are so inviting when you walk through the door and make you feel like you're home and it's such a wonderful neighborhood gem"}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite lunch location for customer lunches.  Options for everybody, food is consistently good and the Thai king crab salad is off the charts.  I haven't been in for dinner yet but over lunch there usually isn't a wait"}
{"text":"In town from San Diego to entertain client and found buck & rider on open table.  This restaurant is fantastic.  Great service , great food and great location in Arcadia.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm so sad about the handful of times that I've been here and it seems like such a meh experience every time. The first time I went was around after it opened and both my mother and I had something foo poisoning related the next day. The other couple of times weren't amazing, but we still gave it a few more chances. The latest time I've been the calamari as bad and the manager came over and tried to make a million excuses AND tell us we were WRONG. What?! When calamari smells bad, you know something isn't right. It's unfortunate when managers can own up OR they have yet to learn that the customer is always right..."}
{"text":"Why did we wait so long to go?!  We just got back from happy hour and it was amazing. Oysters on the half shell, calamari (gluten free and oh, so tasty), Dixie chicken,  lobster and wine (well drinks too) all HALF OFF! The food was very good. The lobster was not rubbery like you get at some restaurants, but was melt in your mouth good. Emma was our waitress and she explained the menu to us and was attentive but not too intrusive. Happy hour is Monday - Saturday until 7pm. The restaurant had a really cool vibe. We will  definitely be back with friends. Did I mention the selection oysters on the half shell, which are flown in fresh everyday, is to die for?..."}
{"text":"I initially had a terrible experience with a server. I brought my concerns it to the Manager's attention, this gentleman was so understanding and hospitable that it made everything so much better. They were so kind and hospitable to us. I will definitely recommend this resturuant.   The food was impeccable the oysters were amazing. Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Love this place... great atmosphere, food's super tasty; easy $200 date with drinks; and that was happy hour."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Saturday night with a group of 7 of us. We really wanted to sit on the patio since the weather was nice and we did call in for a reservation but it was a long wait for the patio or a few minutes for our table inside. We choose the table inside. Our server was great! We placed our drink order and then we placed our food order as we were all quite hungry. We started off with an order of the calamari and it was great! I had the steamed muscles and my boyfriend had the spicy tuna roll (he wasn't too hungry). I have to say the size of his role was VERY small for the price so I don't think we will order the sushi again. The steamed muscles were very good. This was the first time I couldn't finish all of them because they were of good size and it was very filling. Everyone else also seemed to really enjoy their dinner selections as well.   We will be back and will certainly try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I stopped into Buck & Rider because I heard about this life changing stone crab they have and lucky for me it was during their 50% off special. So destiny calls! Valet parking, very fancy, and the restaurant is gorgeous. Perfect atmosphere for a casual date night or family dinner.     The cocktails were delicious and you can't go wrong with happy hour! I am not an oyster person (unless it's done Rockefeller) but the ones we tried were sweet & mild with a squeeze of lemon and some horseradish, amazing. Takes your palate right to the ocean. It definitely changed my whole perspective on raw oysters.     About that stone crab though... It wasn't what I was expecting. The shell was so hard it was almost impossible to get the meat out. It almost tasted like it was still a little frozen so the texture was stringy. I couldn't get a good chunk of meat because it was all shredding to pieces. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be or not but that's just how it tasted for me. Other than that everything was amazing, enjoyable and fresh! I'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Wow... first time here and it was absolutely amazing!!! To start we had the crispy Brussels sprouts and the Baja style seafood cocktail. Then the streak was on par with the best of the best. Awesome filet!!!  The service was great too... from start to finish. Thank you!!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a special occasion place....unless you can afford it every night. That being said, you do get an awesome plate of food. And the service to boot.  The atmosphere is inviting and the low lighting just adds to the romantic ambiance.   We started with the white fish ceviche. The fish was just so delicate, and there was none of that strong vinegar taste you often have with other ceviches.   I had seared scallops....it was a special of the day. And yes, scallops are on every menu these days, but I can never cook them well, so I treat myself. These scallops are a tasty, sweet, salty melt-a-palooza. It's like you are eating something so decadent without all the heaviness.   It's quite a place. The food is divine. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I decided to try Buck & Rider recently. Knowing that it is part of the LGO Group, we had high expectations. We were not disappointed!  We started with the calamari & Brussels sprouts. Both were perfectly seasoned & the breeding on the calamari was light & crisp.  For the entrées, I had the pan seared scallops & my GF had the Radio Milano pasta. My scallops were perfectly cooked! A nice sear, but still had a light texture. The pasta was also excellent & with enough shrimp to balance it out.  GF had a red wine that she enjoyed & I went with the Long Way Back cocktail. If you appreciate the smokey characteristic of mezcal, I can't recommend it highly enough.  We will definitely be back! Next time I think we'll try the Raw Bar!"}
{"text":"A large group of us came for brunch to celebrate a bachelorette party. The waitress was very patient with our many intricate orders and kept our mimosas full. All the food was delicious and the oysters are a must try! I would never ask a waitress to split a check for a large party but the server was on point and knew exactly what each person ordered and shared, and broke it down with individual bills for everyone at the end without request! Great food, great drinks, great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I was so excited to find this place on yelp before we came down for our friends wedding weekend!! My husband and I booked an extra day in town and this place was on our list of restaurants to try. Our hotel screwed up brunch (for 150 might I add) so we started calling places and Buck and Rider were very welcoming and accommodating. We couldn't get all 150 to join us but we had around 50 and all food and drinks came out VERY quickly. Can I tell you 12$ bottomless mimosas are the best deal in town. Seafood was very fresh...we had oysters and stone crab damn good. I also ordered the brussel spouts and a burger (add bacon and a fried egg trust me) All amazing!!!! Thank you to the staff at Buck and Rider you saved the day!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for oyster happy hour and was pleasantly surprised.  The bar staff and patrons were super friendly and the conversations around me sucked me in and as a result, friends were made.  The Blue Point oysters are big, briny with a little Thai sauce. My new friends ordered the brussel sprouts and Rocky Point shrimp which I got to try - very good tasty bites for sure.  Seafood at happy hour beats the traditional fried bar food any day!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We also expected it to be busy being Easter Sunday, but as usual Buck and Rider is on top of it! great drinks, happy and courteous staff. If you haven't brunched here your missing out. Eli was our server. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch a few Sundays ago. They have an amazing happy hour for brunch on Saturday and Sunday. I love oysters so that was the first thing I went for. They were fresh, I watched them being shucked and they tasted so amazing. The voodoo rice is a really good choice. And bottomless mimosas, you cannot beat that for the price. Seriously. I've been back quite a few times and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this restaurant, so I thought I would try it.  I had their fish sandwich.  Eh, not that great.  I expected much more flavor and better presentation, but it just wasn't there.  Definitely not worth $15.  The place was crowded for sure, but the service and food was sub par.  Bush-league really.  I can see the reason people go, it's like an upscale chain restaurant.  Fit's a certain demographic.   Unfortunately it just wasn't for me.   I will not go back, but when it comes to seafood I am very picky."}
{"text":"Fit for a foodie for sure!! I've been to every LGO Owned restaurant, and just like the others this place will not disappoint. Even though it was busy when we went we got our food and drinks right away.  Appetizers: we had the Lobster Roll and Snapper Ceviche. My Favorite!!  Main  Dish: we had the NY Steak with potatoes and arugula. My friend ordered the Pan Fried Mt. Lassen Trout. Very good!  Dessert: We had the pistachio gelato from LGO. It was delicious!   I can't wait to go back!   Plus!! They also offer complimentary valet."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to the airport. We were in the middle of lunch and dinner (around 3 pm) but they let us order off the lunch menu.  We ordered a fish sandwich and a chicken sandwich. Both sandwiches were excellent!   Their oysters looked heavenly!  We will try next time for sure.  sat in the bar area and there were some cool vibes. Super nice staff.  Didn't try any drinks but their drink menu looked good."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Wiz Khalifa - Black And Yellow)  Yeah, un huh, you know what it is Everything I Yelp, I Yelp and sing Yeah, uh huh, eating that's something What I ordered off the bar, that's drinking  Repping my town when you see me you know I'm Yelping Buck and Rider Buck and Rider Buck and Rider Buck and Rider I put it down for my Yelp in my reviews, Bo Bites Buck and Rider Buck and Rider Buck and Rider Buck and Rider    I finally attended Buck & Rider with some friends for a celebration.  The place is hard to get into since the Camelback traffic during happy hour could be hectic.  Thank goodness for complimentary valet!    My friends and I sat at the Patio which only had happy hour drinks during that time.  Happy Hour food was only at the inside bar area; weird, but whatever!  I went for the \"Your Money or Your Life\"; bourbon, benedictine, combier and orange bitters; tasted like an Old Fashion to me.  As we sat we started with some appetizers.  I ordered their crab stuffed Hush Puppies.  Overall, it had the perfect amount of breading giving it a crunchy start while the stuffed crabs were soft to the bite and the sauce atop had a horseradish like minor sting.  Probably my favorite of the night.  For my entree I went for the Scallops; atop a bed of polenta, mushrooms, peas, pancetta, onions, and sun dried tomatoes.  The dish was beautifully plated!  The scallops were cooked to perfection, but overall I thought the dish lacked a punch to my palates.  Almost felt like all the ingredients were there for presentation purposes.    In the end, Buck & Rider is a cool place to hangout.  Drink specials are cheap during happy hour.  If you're definitely a seafood lover then this place is must try for you.  However, I just didn't feel like it was a fit for my taste buds - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Buck & Rider! It's the perfect time of year here in Arizona to sit on their indoor/outdoor patio and enjoy some happy hour with friends. I came here to celebrate getting into graduate school and couldn't have picked a better spot. They were very accommodating to our group of eight. I started out with the Diego Rivera { Frida Kahlo Blanco tequila | grapefruit | fresh thyme} I love a good cocktail that doesn't have too many ingredients and isn't too sweet so this was perfect!   We started with a few apps- the deviled crab dip, salt & pepper calamari, Baja style seafood cocktail, and the mussels. The deviled crab dip was my favorite! The seafood cocktail was huge and had a great assortment of crab, shrimp, and scallops. The mussels were deliciously tender served with chorizo and white wine broth (divine with the sourdough bread). For an entrée I ordered the Thai Style King Crab salad served with avocado, mango, peanut, and cilantro. Everything about the salad was balanced and beautiful.   My only complaint is that they only offer the seafood happy hour at the oyster bar, the happy hour is amazing and they would probably go out of business if they offered it restaurant-wide.   Service was top notch as always, and I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"5 for ambiance and service, 3 for the food. My sister ordered the crunch shrimp roll and it was really below average. Tasted like supermarket sushi. We usually take left overs home but decided not to bring home the sushi because didn't think anyone would like it. Our server was very attentive though and the ambiance is great. I'll be back for the oysters. Hoping for a better experience"}
{"text":"So August 5th was the National Oyster Day, I heard they offer a half off oysters. Since I love oysters, I wasn't going to miss this opportunity to try good oysters on the half shell.  They offer a complimentary valet parking, which is always nice to have.  They had (I think) 6 different oysters on the day I visited. I chose something from California (as she said it was the smallest piece) and something from eat coast. A half dozen each. I like small oysters, I think they just have better flavor to it.  I also shared grilled oysters (this was not on special, regular price). Nice texture and flavor, as much as I love raw oysters, grilled oysters have different taste to it and I like them both way.  Happy hour special wine really complimented oysters.  Glad I took a half day off on Friday to enjoy oysters and wine.  Great way to start my weekend in town."}
{"text":"I must admit, I was expecting a lot since it is owned by LGO.   Went there last night after a show.   Since it was after 10:00 p.m., I asked about the reverse happy hour.   I was told only drinks are on reverse happy hour.   Okay.   My companion ordered the Aunt Charlie and I guess it's an okay drink if one likes sweet drinks.   We ordered the scallop entree ($26) and the troife pasta ($23.)   There were three large scallops surrounded by a sauce and sauted veggies on the side.   The scallops dipped in the sauce was mehhh okay.   The veggies were seasoned with an overpowering array of seasoning.  The troife pasta had what appeared to be pieces of shrimp, not the whole shrimp.  Few small pieces of sausage and some kale and sundried tomatoes.   I have no idea what kind of pasta it was.   It looked like small broken pieces of thin spaghetti.  That dish was nondescript as well.   In fact, I thought the seasoning was a bit bland.   I tried it by putting some of the veggies from my companion's dish on it.  It didn't help at all.   Both dishes were not very big.   I don't eat that much, but if I was a bigger person, I don't think I would have been full.   Would I go back?    I doubt it.   There are much better restaurants out there.  And I feel the food is outrageously expensive for what one gets."}
{"text":"I had a meeting dinner with my coworkers on a Wednesday night the atmosphere was delightful the service was impeccable and the food was stupendous!!!!!  I had the ribeye and it was to die for. The Brussels Sprouts were awesome!  Our server was excellent! Can't wait to take the family!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The oysters are extremely fresh and high quality. The atmosphere is upper scale and trendy. The interior decor is laid back and tastefully dine.   We sat at the bar during happy hour and Christian took amazing care of us! He recommended some amazing drinks and appetizers off the menu and sampled some awesome whiskey for us. We loved the Brussels sprouts and cranberry creek oysters!   We were visiting from out of town but we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have now been here for lunch a few times. Everything is very good,  which you come to expect when you visit an LGO place. I've only been for lunch,  but it never seems that crowded which is surprising. Service is quick and I'd definitely love to try dinner here.   Food:  Crispy Brussel sprouts: nice and crispy,  pairs great with tang of goat cheese and sweetness of apple gastrique. A  Sushi grade ahi tuna burger: seared well. Flavors were good with spice and avocado. Maybe I just prefer a seared ahi sandwich to be a steak,  but the texture of the seared ground tuna wasn't for me. B-  Last time I had the pan fried loup de mer and it was outstanding.   Overall, a great addition the to area. Would love to try dinner, but lunch has been great the three times I've been."}
{"text":"Listen. This is not 5 star material. But a darn solid 4 star. Great ambience, great service, and the food was excellent! One of my new favorites in the valley.  Great date place."}
{"text":"I've been in here twice and enjoy Buck & Rider.  Sitting at the bar I've always had fast and friendly service.  I wasn't crazy about my crab or shrimp rolls but they were 1/2 off on Sunday so what the heck.  They also have a nice craft beer selection in addition to their wine list.  This is the new place to be and be seen in Arcadia.  It has a great vibe and energy.  Make sure to grab a cookie on your way out!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Buck and Rider for quite awhile.  Finally!  We went for Happy Hour and they have a great menu of items.  Its more of a fresh seafood restaurant than burgers and chicken.   The restaurant from the outside appears to be small however upon entering, its larger than it looks.  The decor is fab...the ambience and energy is great.  Its a total conversation place meaning you go for lively conversation and not for the sports bar feel.  A very warm and inviting atmosphere.  To start, aside for the Ballast Longfin beer, we had the special of Oyster Rockefeller which were fabulously savory! A great start!  That should be part of their menu or maybe ask for it off menu. I ordered the pan roasted mussels.  It has chorizo, white wine with grilled sourdough bread. Now with shellfish, you have to be mindful of pieces of shell and sand.  None of oysters had it but some of the oysters had several shell pieces that made its way into my mouth.  A little disconcerting.   If my memory serves me correctly, I believe that shellfish are more in season in months that end in \"R\"...that may explain for the size of the mussels.   They were pretty small yet plentiful, but quite a bit of work for the meat .  The chorizo did not add any particular flavor to this dish and probably would be a little better  presentation if it the chorizo was shaved or sliced on a bias instead of diced; the diced pieces didn't fit into the mussels so it was difficult to eat both the mussel and chorizo simultaneously.  The diced look made the dish look more like corned beef hash than a premiere player on the menu.  The mussel broth and the grilled sourdough bread was outstanding although it would be nice if the slices of bread were either thicker or additional slices offered.  There's nothing like having to sop up something so deliciously rich with that bread.  I was afraid to ask for additional slices since I thought by time I got the additional  sourdough bread the broth would have been too cold.  My wife had the half lobster and she seemed to enjoy that very much especially for the price, it appeared to be well worth it.  The overall experience rates a 4 primarily for the great decor, layout, energy and fantastic environment, the meal that I had may need some slight upgrades.  We will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here with my kid's mom for dinner. It was busy as it was a Saturday evening but the wait was a short 10 minutes. There was complimentary valet so no need for hunting down a spot. The turn in from Camelback to the valet circle was a little sharp though.   There's two bars, one inside and one on the patio. You can also see the raw bar in the middle of the restaurant. Granted that it's in the Arcadia area, it seemed for the night that the vast, vast majority of restaurant goers were above 45-50. Service was definitely on par with what you would expect from a restaurant like this.   We appetizers that consisted of a spicy crab dip that was delicious, about half dozen Crystal Point oysters that were also delicious, and a lobster trobanjan roll. The lobster roll was delicious and had a slight hint of spiciness.   For our entrees, I had a ribeye served rare with a side of sauteed cauliflower and she had a center cut filet mignon served med rare with a side of sauteed baby carrots. Both steaks were very good cuts of beef.   Overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for restraunt week and was pleasantly surprised.  We enjoyed the patio and the prefixed menu.  Looking forward to it again."}
{"text":"Had to change my review and drop a star because of our most recent experience at Buck & Rider. We have been loyal customers for a while now and never had a problem until this past Saturday. We went for brunch and instead of the usual bottomless mimosas we opted for the bloody mary since the server pointed out that it was on happy hour. The price on the regular menu was $10 and she said it was lower than that. She also mentioned the oysters were half price so we ordered a half a dozen. Not only were we terribly dissapointed in the quality of the bloody mary mix, we were charged full price for them and all the oysters. It was a shame that we received false information and paid $10 for a bloody mary that was so generic. Carly's Bloody Mary is almost half the price and 100% better. You can taste the in-house made bloody mary mix there. We will still return to Buck & Rider because their food is great, but we will absolutely be more careful with what we order in regards to the happy hour menu. And stay away from the bloody mary."}
{"text":"Had lunch at B & R the other day -was not impressed. My date and I ordered 2 fish sandwiches to split. They were greasy over battered and fried to a crisp. Sloppy and awkward  to eat in public. I would have rather enjoyed a dripping tomato sandwich eaten over my kitchen sink! Did I mention the prices? Too high for value received. The ambiance is very pleasant and wait staff friendly. The kitchen was hardly taxed from the sparseness of the crowd, yet it was quite a long time between ordering and delivery of our food. We're sticking with LGO."}
{"text":"While visiting family over the holidays in Arizona we stopped by Buck and Rider and loved the food!!!!! The oysters were super fresh and yummy, my husband had the Hong kong halibut and he devoured it, the ahi tuna tostadas were so amazing and had so much flavor. Our server Errin was great and very attentive. We will definitely be visiting again and wished there was one closer to home for us!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Super busy, but excellent service. Great Energy. Beautiful inside. Raw bar AMAZING.  Definitely Coming Back."}
{"text":"Love the little oyster bar, reminds me of the thing I enjoy most about Seattle - except it's here in Phoenix!  I like that the oyster selection changes and they are nice and fresh.  The seafood is really the star here.  They have some non-seafood dishes too but those can be hit and miss.   The cocktails are pretty good and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"LGO Hospitality does it again...  I couldn't wait to try Buck & Rider, and now that I have, I can't wait to return!  This hot new seafood centric restaurant has only been open for a week, but you wouldn't know it based on our experience.  My husband and I enjoyed an early dinner date night at newly opened B&R tonight and had a fun and memorable meal.  It's group service, but Mia was our main server and did a fabulous job!    We enjoyed sharing the following: -a half dozen oysters -snapper ceviche -lobster roll -calamari  It was all fresh and delicious, and paired perfectly with the glass of wine (Domaine Serge Les Boursicote Sancerre) I selected.  It's worth noting that they also offer a solid cocktail list for all of you cocktail connoseiurs ;)  We sat inside but right on the border of the outdoor patio... We enjoyed an almost perfect view of Camelback mountain.  I say \"almost perfect\" as there is also a view of a Jack in the Box sign that gets in the way ;)  The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and classy, as is the architecture of the restaurant; all fitting of the inspiration behind the space; a house located in a swanky beach town on the Australian coast.  In addition to complimentary valet, B&R offers patrons LGO's signature sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out... it is the perfect sweet ending to your meal.    For now B&R is open for dinner only, 6 days a week (closed Monday).  I hope they will extend their hours into lunch soon.  This is definitely a welcome addition to the 'hood!"}
{"text":"There's complimentary valet parking in front. Patio with fireplace and indoor seating areas. Great place for happy hour with friends before 7:00pm on a Tuesday.  I came here with a friend that was visiting from out of town so we decided to check this place out after she passed by it. So glad we did! I had an awesome experience with making reservations for Tuesday at 5:30 pm. We were both running a bit late so I called to let them know about our 15minute delay and the person who answered the phone was extremely friendly and understanding and pushed us down on the schedule and held the spot for us.  Everything we ordered was pretty good. From medium rare hamburger to Brussels Sprouts with cranberry sauce to their appetizer cocktail crab in a martini glass to tuna sushi roll with avocado. The roll was my favorite part of our meal. The Brussels Sprouts were on the sweeter side, so if you don't like sweet stuff, I suggest avoiding it. I liked it, but I couldn't eat a lot of it. The crab was simple, shredded in a cup with a dollop of cocktail sauce, nothing wild, my friend found it underwhelming. The medium rare burger was a bit too rare inside. Very red, so my friend couldn't eat the center.   Overall, we had a good experience with the atmosphere, candle light, patio table with a purse hanger next to a fireplace, and friendly staff.  It was just a bit much when our waitress kept coming back and asking if we need anything else, like removing our plates, or ordering more food. The way she did it gave us the feeling of being rushed out of there so they can service other people. I can understand the business aspect of that, but it really felt like she approached us too often. Normally, it's the opposite where wait staff forget you are there."}
{"text":"Food: 4.0/5.0 Service: 3.5/5.0 Value: 2.5/5.0 Decor: 3.5/5.0 Overall: 4.0/5.0   Nice and fancy seafood spot on Camelback.  Not sure seafood is the first thing I think of when I'm in Phoenix, but it hit the spot nonetheless."}
{"text":"It's a place I would have to give another try.  Very happening, fun and noise atmosphere.  The patio was taken by an event, which was a shame since the April weather was just perfect.  I ordered the ceviche and it was delicious, although I would have wanted more fish and avo and far less cucumbers and tomatoes."}
{"text":"Fab place for brunch! This place has a lovely, chill vibe that's prefect for a leisurely weekend brunch. The patio is great, but we decided to sit in the bar area where you can get the oysters at HH pricing. Food was really good and our server was fantastic.   - It's fun trying a variety of oysters since I'm still figuring out which kind I like. My faves were the Kusshi and Conways. - Roasted brussels are pretty common on menus these days, but the preparation here was unique. They were perfectly cooked with just a hint of sweetness, and a clever goat cheese brulee on the side. - Avocado toast- a big slice of thick bread with creamy avo, burrata, and an over-easy egg. The sliced baby tomatoes were delish- so sweet! I wish the bread had been toasted because it got soggy quickly, but still, really enjoyed this and would order again. - Eggs sardou- similar to a benedict but with a whole roasted artichoke serving as the base instead of bread. The eggs were perfectly poached, sundried tomato added a fantastic sweetness, the sauteed greens on the bottom- just the right amount of crisp to give good texture. I usually find hollandaise sauce too rich for me, but this version was light and tasty. A winner! - Smoked salmon salad with pink grapefruit wedges, olives, and avocado. Huge pile of greens with all sorts of yummy textures and flavors. Would definitely order this again, but ask for dressing on the side. (Dressing was good, but too much for my tastes). - Flourless chocolate cake was great! A huge piece (plenty for 4 people to share) with a big scoop of pistachio ice cream. The chocolate was dense, and not too sweet. Our ice cream was just a tiny bit melty, nothing I would have even noticed, but our server apologized and brought us another huge scoop on the side. Did I mention how great our server was? Worth saying again!  Tasty food, great drink specials, professional servers, and a good vibe. Recommend and will return."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   Not that there was any doubt, but my dad came through again finding this gem!  I told my dad I needed some dad-daughter time, and he drove up from Tucson to take me to dinner.  His pick: Buck & Rider.  BUCK & RIDER: THE HISTORY   Ok, first, what does \"Buck & Rider\" mean?  In this context, a buck is a fattened up, full of meat, usually male crab and a rider is usually a female crab locked on. Fishermen like this combination, because they get a 2-for-1.  In the Phoenix restaurant scene context, Buck & Rider is a casual upscale restaurant on Camelback at 44th Street; the newest venture by LGO Hospitality owners, Bob Lynn and his wife, artist Sara Abbott.  Self-taught chef, Bob Lynn, originally from Chicago, began his career at 13 years old, as a sous chef at a fine dining restaurant in Chicago and continued on to have operated over 60 restaurants including Chelsea's Kitchen, The Misfit Restaurant & Bar, The Luggage Room Pizzeria, La Grande Orange Cafe, The Otis Bar and more. His mission: help great ingredients realize their full potential. And Bob Lynn's Buck & Rider holds true to that philosophy by any standard.   THE STORY   Buck & Rider seems to have no place to self-park, so that's a good tip to start off with, so you can just go straight to valet. Also, Buck & Rider does not take reservations, so plan accordingly. There is a huge dining room, good size bar and spacious outdoor patio, so it's probably not really an issue, unless you plan on eating at peak hours. Although the weather was lovely, my dad and I sat in the main dining room which was charming. (see pics)  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   From the minute we walked in, to when we walked out, every member of the staff was extremely accommodating.  The host/manager let us pick our own table, and the waitress was sweet and knowledgeable. She even had a hand-held computer where she inputted our order as we gave it to her and used it to swipe our credit card at the end, so there was no wait.  Let me tell you about the food and drinks!  I started with a glass of the Domaine du Margalleau Brut Vouvray, followed by the Aunt Charlie (Aylesbury Duck vodka, earl grey tea, honey-lemon shrub, served up). (see pics)  My dad and I have always done this thing where we get a bunch of different items and share, and this time was no different.   For starters, we got the deviled crab dip and the fresh pull-apart dinner rolls with Jacobsen's sea salt. Followed by the lobster bisque. Next was the avocado salad with chickpeas, feta, niçoise olives, heirloom cherry tomatoes, upland cress, and za'atar and pan fried white fish with sautéed broccolini, and lemon caper beurre blanc.(see pics) Everything was absolutely superb.  CONCLUSION   I honestly can not think of anything that would have made the experience any better.  I know I will be back many times!  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *Hours: Open daily at 11am - \"Open Late\"  *For more information: buckandrider.com"}
{"text":"Had their baked yuzu crab roll and crab cakes yesterday and they were fantastic!  Very friendly staff.  We noticed that our bill was overcharged at the end of the meal, we brought it to their attention and they were incredibly apologetic.  They ended up giving us $50 in gift cards for their mess up.  It was very generous on their end, I thought.  Overall very very pleased with service and food/ drinks"}
{"text":"The decor here is absolutely great, I love that it's not too bright! Our server Chezik made our night, she was super sweet and gave us the exact amount of service/attention we needed.   The food is more of a 3-3.5 stars. Two items we tried to order they were out of. The Baja shrimp cocktail was good. Sushi was just ok. My halibut was a little mushy/under done (especially in the middle) but I was able to eat most of it (we aren't the send back food type esp for a group bday dinner) King crabs legs and scallops were both great. The birthday dessert was a special touch and nice way to end our evening."}
{"text":"What an amazing Happy Hour!  Definitely get the calamari!  The shrimp and oysters were great!  The Worship the Camel is a great cocktail!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is amazing! There is something for everyone on this little menu. My friend and I tasted quite a few items and each one was great! We had the half lobster, Brussel sprouts with goat cheese, beef tartare, and a few drinks. We would've had the spicy salmon roll but unfortunately they ran out. The seafood was really fresh and the service was outstanding. I will absolutely return when I am back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is packed.  Valet parking only.  Place is nicely decor, nice atmosphere, it is happening at the bar, and the servers are supper nice.  Maybe it is because I am back from Maui.  The food just did not wow me.  I got the Pan Fried White Fish with rice and lemon caper beurre blanc.  It is just ok."}
{"text":"The staff is phenomenal with every aspect when we checked out this new spot. The drinks good, I got the Worship The Camel drink. Loved the oysters and the fried calamari! In addition the ambiance and lighting was perfect! Keep it up Buck & Rider!"}
{"text":"Oh man! Boy did I love love love this place! I can't express all my joy but the drinks were amazing and food is healthy delicious! Went with friends on a busy Saturday night. We had drinks at the bar while we waited to get seated and had a few snacks, food didn't make me feel bloated, perfect portions."}
{"text":"We wanted seafood... We got seafood! Stone Crab is out of this world and the Oysters were great! Cocktails were well crafted and service was top shelf! Must try the cornbread. Go with a group so you can try everything!"}
{"text":"I was in town in Phoenix again for work and we were recommended to come to Buck & Rider for dinner. I checked out the menu and once I realized it was another LGO Hospitality location I knew for sure that it would be a great dining experience.  I frequent the other locations (Chelsea's Kitchen in Sky Harbor and in Pasadena, CA where I'm from) and I was very excited to try another concept of theirs.  We ordered many appetizers as always.  We got oysters, the crispy brussel sprouts, and steak tartare.  The Dixie Picnic Chicken Snack was a very pleasant surprise which was essentially chicken tenders but seasoned and cooked to perfection.  For my entree, I really wanted to get a steak but as you could probably guess I was full from the appetizers.  So I ended up getting the Radio Milano Pasta Troife which was amazing.  It had a great spicy kick to it as well.  Anna our waitress said it would be nothing like I have ever tasted and she was right.  The portion was perfect considering I wasn't hungry after all the great appetizers.  The desserts were amazing, I didn't get to see the menu so I don't know the name but the meringue pie that was brought over was delicious.  I'm not normally a huge fan of meringue pies but it wasn't too tart and the crust gave it a great texture in each bite.  We came in a pretty large group and it seemed like everybody had a great time.  Thank you for the staff that helped us out, they were very attentive and proactive.  I hope we come back next time so we can try the other items on the menu.  There was too much I missed out on.  And of course, don't forget the cookies at the front!"}
{"text":"We came as a group and sampled the appetizers. The sushi was probably the best of all we ordered and we tried both the Baked Yuzu Crab Roll and the Lobster Tobanjan Roll. I would definitely recommend coming for the sushi alone.   We also tried the baked crab dip, which was dry and over seasoned, I can't imagine this is how it should be prepared. I can say I've never had a baked crab dip like that before! The radish slices were a nice touch, the crackers though house made were far too crumbly and there just wasn't enough crackers and radish for the radio of dip (which was just meh)!   The calamari was so so, but we felt over spicy (and not in a good way). They were cooked ok, average tenderness but not impressively so.   Prices are a little steep, and don't forget to save money for valet. I'm not impressed with places that force you into valet parking, especially with a lot that I don't think really justifies it.  The mini salty chocolate chunk cookies were good. We nearly missed them altogether and it was only because someone out of our party happened upon them on the way to the restrooms.   From what I gather some of the other menu offerings like the oysters are to die for, but I'm not really a huge fan of raw oysters."}
{"text":"Really yummy place especially if you love oysters!! The staff is very knowledgeable of the different types of oysters being briny etc. service was super friendly and attentive, cocktails were well crafted and our meals were super delicious! Would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Perhaps too kool for me, this place actually has really good food.  An eclectic crowd if twenty somethings and 30-40 year old hipsters, we were brought here by our friends who had recently imbibed in the seafood the previous evening.    We started out with a platter of ultra fresh Washington state oyster that were served with a spread of horseradish, and various other sauces.  Next were the dollar each, once again, ultra fresh jumbo shrimp that were peel and eat.  Some in out party were not digging the peel part.   Next, the Brussel sprouts were, for me, the highlight of the night.  Not bitter as sprouts sometimes can be, they were prepared crisp and crunchy.  I wanted more.    The calamari was just ok and I would not order it again, as was the salmon, which was over cooked.  Finally, the lobster cakes were great, with just the right amount of bread crumbs and good sized lobster chunks.   I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I tried a few different things my second time around and here is what you need to know!  -Go starting at Happy Hour-- you can't beat $6 cocktails! -The crispy brussel sprouts are TO DIE FOR - Scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked. I would definitely recommend ordering this entree over the halibut."}
{"text":"I love buck & Rider. I always get the Brussel sprouts and the crab with bacon on an English muffin. Oysters are always good and the atmosphere is nice. Also, the flourless chocolate cake is good too. I tend to just stick with those food orders because the \"sushi\" is not good. I'm sure there might be other good items, but the sushi is not one of them."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had oysters and calamari. Great vibe and very good service. Definitely will return in the future."}
{"text":"The name sort of through me off. I did not expect the atmosphere to be as it is, nor did i expect the seafood selection that they have. A variety of oysters, sashimi,  sushi, lobster, and all available on happy hour for reasonable prices.  We arrived there a little early, as they don't open till 11:30, but they were nice enough to let us grab a high top while we waited to order. Good food and good service. Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"Love LGO and the rest of the offerings.  Great building, great food. Portions are small..."}
{"text":"Menu is all over the place... Corn bread, sushi, oysters, Chinese style halibut, steak, and tostadas...The oysters were excellent but the sushi was uneventful. You could go down the street and get better for half the cost. Service was a little awkward. I think Buck and Rider could be good if they tighten up the menu and work out the kinks in service. At this point I'm in no hurry to return. The prices seemed on the high side, especially for the sushi. Great location and patio, well executed design of the restaurant. Food was just 'meh.'"}
{"text":"$12 bottomless mimosas could you go wrong?! They have three different options for the mimosa which I thought was rather unique. You can get orange, pomegranate, or grapefruit. I highly suggest trying one and enjoying their awesome patio!   When it came to food I had the avocado toast which was absolutely amazing! It comes with a fried egg on top which I though was kind of weird at first but I ended up loving it! I also had the hashbrowns which were super good as well! They come in a skillet and there are plenty to share with your friends! My friend had the smoked salmon Benedict which she said was better than Breakfast Club  The salmon was so fresh it tasted like it was just caught that day! A classic Bennie and totally worth the calories with the homemade vegan English muffins!   The hostess greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked in the door which set the bar for the rest of the experience. Our server had great suggestions and answered every question I had flawlessly! Our drinks were never empty (including the mimosa) and the manager even stopped by just to see how everything was tasting! We really felt welcome the entire meal.   It was over all an excellent experience! I would suggest Buck and Rider for your next brunch date!   The patio is also dog friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Half price crab and lobster with amazing cocktails for $6. The only drawback is that it smells a little fishy in there. Such a great deal on seafood tho and the restaurant itself is really beautiful."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Wish I could give it more than 3 stars. We had a great outdoor table-live the location and the vibe, but the food was just average."}
{"text":"Food was mostly great however everything was overpriced.  The salt&pepper calamari was undercooked and flavorless and $8 for an 8oz IPA? C'mon!  Dear architect, your swanky patio is steps from the busiest, noisiest 3 lane street (Phoenix-Scottsdale Speedway) in the neighborhood drowning out any kind of conversation you thought you were going to have, it's a problem.  Why not design the building with the patio off the bar in the back?...where it's quiet."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. I love that each time we've been here, I sigh after each bite! The service is great. We were there last Sunday and the manager was very attentive and professional. I would highly recommend Buck and Rider for a beautiful attmosphere, great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"We were driving looking for some place to eat found Buck & Rider! Fantastic and delicious"}
{"text":"Attended buck and rider for a late dinner on Friday night. I had the scallops and we split the Hong Kong Halibut. The scallops were served over a very delicious tomato compote and it had just the right amount of spice. Out waitress informed us upon arrival that all of their seafood is flown in daily and it is never frozen and you could tell. The halibut was seasoned perfectly with a crispy panko crust. The micro-green mixture served with it was great as well, it was crispy not soggy. The price point was high but that is to be expected from something that was on a plane hours before hitting my plate. The atmosphere was great we sat on the back patio. I hope to see some type of live music there in the future."}
{"text":"Chezik, our server, was very friendly and knowledgeable. The atmosphere and food were excellent. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a seafood fix in Phoenix! I LOVE oysters, and Buck & Rider always has a great selection to choose from. They also do great sushi, and the rolls in the cast iron skillet are to die for.   The only thing I don't love is that it can be really loud inside. This is not the place to come if you want to have a conversation with more than 1-2 people. The patio is really nice, but there are no misters or fans to mitigate the summer heat.   Other than that, Buck & Rider is by far my favorite seafood restaurant in Phoenix, and the atmosphere is fun, the service is always friendly and efficient, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Props to our server, Gabi, who was so attentive and patient with our table, especially my 93 year old grandma!   The food here was really great. We came for resturant week, most of us ordered off the resturant week menu but some strayed from it.   First of all, the bread they bring out to start with is soooooo good!   Warm, soft pretzel bread. Yum!   They have a great variety of drinks, something for everyone.   I got the crab cakes as my main dish. These crab cakes had so much crab in it, as opposed to many restaurants, where you get a lot of fillers.  I appreciated the amount of crab! The crab cakes came with asparagus, which was nicely seared and had a sauce that was a tad spicy but that sauce was just drizzled on a little. There was another sauce that came on the plate that went well with the asparagus and crab cakes.   The other favorite dish at the table seemed to be the halibut.    This place was really busy! Definitely recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"My girl and I dined here tonight for our 1 year Anniversary! I can't begin to express how amazing the service not to mention the food was! Our server Heather was so great, knew her product and recommended what she likes which was the ribeye! Wow! So much flavor. My girl ordered the sea bass and it was so delicious! Just melted I. Your mouth w a lil bit of crunch! Our desert which was the flourless chocolate cake paired w the pistachio gelato was absolutely unreal! This place seriously blew me away! The staff was so friendly even the manager came to the table to wish us a happy anniversary! By far one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time! We'll def be back! Thanks B&R!"}
{"text":"I would choose Buck & Rider over and over again as my favorite \" let's go out to eat\" spot in PHX. Complimentary valet to start, inviting and open space both within and outside. Oyster bar, outdoor bar, daily fresh catches and menu changing providing the freshest options to tantalize the tastebuds.   Their desserts are fabulous too! Just try the lemon meringue pie!  Never a miss when dining at Buck & Rider. Love it!"}
{"text":"first visit was perfect food, great service..........been back twice........going again....and, open late"}
{"text":"I have been to buck and rider three times, the staff from the valet to the waitresses have been very nice and professional.  My first two visits left me with the same thought. It's OK but not half as good as Chelsea's kitchen (same owners).  On my third visit I sat in the bar and had a beer and spicy tuna role which was almost inedible because it was so chewy which I thought was connective tissue in the tuna but when I spit out the offensive chewy substance I realized it was the  seaweed wrap.  The Asian girl I was with told me seaweed gets tough if it gets too moist, no big deal but I expect more when I'm in a nice place.  I gave it three tries and I'm just not impressed by this place. Go to Chelseas their sister restaurant instead which is really really good!"}
{"text":"I love buck and rider!  The seafood is fresh, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. Even during the summer sitting outside is great with the misters and shade. The real reason I keep coming back is for the lemon meringue pie. Wow is that incredible !!!"}
{"text":"I think I've eaten here 10 times and the food and service are consistently very good. The sushi rolls are excellent!"}
{"text":"Another steller eatery from LGO. Buck and Rider takes the spot as my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Who would have thought you could get such fresh seafood in the desert? The decore is upscale yet comfortable. Service was great. There was a team vibe with several people checking in on our table. I start by recommending the lobster roll \"Nik Niks\". I have had euphoric reactions to food before, but nothing like this. Something about the poached butterly lobster made me want to take my clothes off. (amazingly it wasn't the oysters). Yes of course we did have oysters. It was date night after all. They have a great selection of oysters updated on the board daily. We chose something smaller and on the sweet side because that's the way I like em. They were very fresh. The crab cakes were good, they didn't stand out much from what I've had before, but I did like the sauce and pepitas. The crab and macadamia roll was also a hit. The crab, asparagus, and macadamia nuts made my mouth happy with all the combined textures. And the Thai king crab salad was my second favorite item on the menu. It was light but packed with flavor and I've been craving it ever since. I'm telling you...euphoric lobster rolls and fresh oysters makes a winning combination for date night. Men take your ladies here! Date night will end very well for you I promise!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Phoenician on Camelback we were looking for a nearby restaurant. We spotted Buck and Rider and decided to try it out. Ambiance was great vibe with in and out seating. The food and service were A+! Oysters were very good... sauces were good and HOT. Ribs were so tender they fell off the bone. Rub was hot but not too hot... perfect! Halibut very good and seasoned so well. But the hands down best was the Tuna Burger! It was so yummy on a toasted bun with avocado and sauce.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 3 stars but honestly, it wasn't \"A-OK\", in my opinion. The drinks & service were good but that didn't off-set the cost and quality of the food. I went for the oysters and was unimpressed. They were bland AF. Same for the rolls; I had the Spicy Tuna and California ( I know, *basic*).  The best part of the meal was the \"lemon meringue\" pie. It's more of a Lemon Custard pie; the topping is not meringue, it's whipped cream. Pie crust was delicious. I would recommend this place for drinks and dessert. I wish Camarillo's was still here.  I am a fan of LGO and Ingo's and will continue to eat there, but I cannot say I would be back to bunk and rider."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Had the ribeye that was burndt and not cooked to what we requested.  It tasted like burndt charred grease and burndt rosemary.  We also had the burger which was super greasy and had ZERO flavor.  Very loud atmosphere. Not fast service.  If you like fish, this might be a good place but fish isnt my thing.  VERY EXPENSIVE for what you get. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Oysters were delicious!  Came here with a friend who thought it was a steakhouse and while walking up saw the Oyster Bar sign.  We ordered a couple of apps and I had a sushi roll (was not really impressed due to the amount of furikake (rice seasonings) on it).  Waitress was super awesome and told us about the name of the restaurant.  (You've gotta ask if you have a dirty mind..)"}
{"text":"Happy hour brunch at eleven am on Saturday?  Yes!  Steak tartare, fresh oysters and fresh lobster all at happy hour prices?  Yes!  Brussel Sprouts with apple gastrique and fried rice too?  Yes!  Add ahi grade tuna burger, fish and chips, bottomless mimosas, mixed drinks and ipas and I am sold...  You, Buck and Rider, are my new favorite weekend spot.  Fresh fish flown in daily and great service only sweetens the deal...  I will see you again soon."}
{"text":"This place is very eye appealing! The bar staff is great! The drinks are poured well and flavorful! Their desserts are delicious!!! Food was great!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I really like going here for a drink.  I am a vegetarian, and they only have 2 simple salads that are available to eat.  They do not have a vegetarian menu, and when asked if they were able to do anything or substitute anything, they said no, what u see is when u get.  So unfortunately they will never get our full business only a drink or 2. : (."}
{"text":"Came in with my hubby for Valentines Day. Our bartender/server Christian was AMAZING . It was our first time here and we had no clue what to order and literally all his recommendations were so delicious. The service here is THE BEST!! Definitely in my favorite restaurants list"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and amazing food!    I had a fantastic lunch with the bestest of friends and really enjoyed the oysters and crab cakes with our glasses of wine.  I had the salmon and bestest had the tuna burger.  Both were fantastic.  The service was excellent and really friendly.   Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We hosted a Rehearsal Dinner at Buck & Rider this past weekend.  What an amazing event on the patio.  The staff were over-the-top gracious, helpful and fun and the food and drink simply amazing!  But why not?  We have always been served AMAZING at B&R!  Laura, Lauren, Erica, Christian and the rest are so cool; we love walking into this place and experiencing the best of everything--food, drinks, ambience, service, location--what did I miss?  It's all wonderful."}
{"text":"Summary: nice decor, good food, great service. We had drinks by the bar while waiting for our table and it was very loud. However, drinks were very good (had the buck and rider and your money). We ordered three apps: Brussels sprouts, crab dip, and crab and macadamia roll. All were just ok. My halibut was good, but I wouldn't order it again. We also ordered the surf and turf and thought it was just ok, too. Overall, food was underwhelming for the price. Would come back for happy hour, though."}
{"text":"The oysters were so fresh and tasty!  Love their happy hour, king crab legs were delicious, especially when dipped in butter!  Ceviche was excellent and drinks were yummy.  Serving staff super friendly and helpful.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I came here to brunch. I am so completely in love with this place. The food here was so delicious and the service was even better than the food.  The presentation of the food is delicate yet honey. Please take a look at my photos. You can see their attention to detail in the plating. Their plating is fun and interactive.   We ordered so much food so I really don't know where to begin.   But I'll start with the service. The service was superb. We had a very friendly waitress. That is a big deal for me. I rate higher for restaurants with a well trained staff.   We started off with freshly squeezed orange juice. They do add sugar so it's not all natural. Just a quick FYI.   Then we ordered our raw bar platter. We ordered lobster, oysters and some other things. But, my favorite was the lobster and the oyster which is why I'm mentioning it.   Then we ordered their sushi. Which I do not really recommend. The salad it came with was good though."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by B&R on our way to a concert - a couple of drinks and snacks and it was phenomenal. Server was extremely friendly and down to earth. I love dirty martinis, but wanted to try a cocktail from the menu - The Aunt Charlie was awesome. Complex, cool flavor, not sweet - just perfect. We had oysters and the server did a great job explaining the different types and making a recommendation - they were tasty and the sauces were great. We had the crab dip - very good, ask for extra crackers! Then capped the meal with sushi - fresh and up there with the best in the valley. They have set a standard. The patio is a must and this restaurant is THE place to be - Get over here for HH or a fun/trendy night out! And don't forget the choc chip cookie on your way out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on a Saturday night for my birthday. He made a reservation for 6pm and the hostess asked if there was any occasion being celebrated and he said my birthday.  We started off with a couple glasses of Chardonnay $42 (6 glasses) For appetizer we ordered bread. $7 It was a little dry and not worth it. (They should just offer those rolls for free). For entrees we ordered the Papago combination $75, ribeye steak with fries $37 and scallops entree w salad $29. Let me say I love their assortment of sauces that come with the seafood.  The assorted platter of seafood lobster, king crab, shrimp, lobster claws and oysters was pretty good but my favorite were the oysters. They were super fresh and flavorful. We ordered 6 more buck and rider oysters $22 after (they come al la carte). The ribeye was ok. Not the best steak I've had. Part of the cut was medium well and the more fatty side was medium rare. Not worth $37 dollars for a steak of that quality. The pan seared scallops were delicious. You get 4 plump scallops rare in the middle with a sweet and buttery after taste. The reason why I am giving a 3 star rating is because of the server. My boyfriend informed the server that we were celebrating my birthday and she just said ok. Then at the end of the dinner she asked if we wanted anything else. So he mentioned again if they did anything for birthdays. She said, oh did you want dessert? We got the key lime pie and it came with a candle. We got the check and they charged us for the birthday pie.  That's fine that they don't give free pie for birthdays but it would be nice to be informed that they don't offer anything special for birthdays so we don't get disappointed. Why ask in the first place if we're celebrating an occasion? I mean we spent over  270 dollars that night, the least they could do is make us feel special or at least be thorough about their occasion policy.  Anyways, one good tip I have, I probably won't ever go there for a normal dinner like Saturday, but they do have a great happy hour Mon-Fri 1130-400 half priced oysters and lobsters. I'll probably be back one of those days for some oysters and wine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Buck & Ryder last night for New Year's Eve. We had such a wonderful experience! Not only was the food amazing, but the service was even better. Marsha was our server and gave awesome recommendations, and was so friendly and attentive. I ordered the scallops, and my boyfriend ordered the ribeye and both were fantastic.The lemon meringue pie is also to die for. This place is also a must for their seafood bar... the oysters and the sauces they came with are phenomenal!!! We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"First try! We sampled the provisions: Shrimp and Chorizo skewer, amazing! Peeled jumbo shrimp, perfection like sitting at a gulf side eatery in Florida. Ahi Tuna tostada, tuna was perfect, spice was too much for my taste, but I'm not a spicy lover. The Clam chowder was not chowder, more like soup, but it was a gastronomic treat. The textures, variety and flavor was at another level. A unexpected treat, a must try! My preference is that the bar is stocked with at least one favorite Tequila and they serve 1942 Anejo.  For the service, a solid 7, not bad, but not extraordinary.  I think I need to try again for dinner if I can  muster the discipline try something else. The chowder and the shrimp skewer are addicting!  Part TWO. (Full disclosure Allison gave me a gift certificate to come back)  Well... The clam chowder and fresh shrimp had to begin the feast. Growing up in Florida, fresh BIG shrimp always brings back fond memories. We tried the crab dip and I must say WOW! The wife enjoyed the (not) sea bass. It was a perfectly prepared fish with broccolini. The Boston kid and the Burbank kid both had the lobster rolls and were not disappointed. My crab cakes were great. The manager Laura stopped by to say hi. Of course we will be back! The ambiance is worth the trip. The food is just a treat that completes the experience. Love this place. LGO rocks!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a time date night. The seafood is good as well! Fried fish had a corn meal batter with zero to it. Service and atmosphere was good but the seafood was amazing cooked."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh seafood. Happy hour is a great deal on all things seafood. Go sit at the bar and try it all it's so worth it! Staff friendly and atmosphere is relaxed and inviting."}
{"text":"The absolute best thing you can do for yourself when you come here is order the Brussels sprouts. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been to this restaurant just a couple of times prior to visiting on Friday, April 6. I have enjoyed each and every visit there as the food and service are one-of-a-kind. For this particular visit it was a celebration of my birthday and I have never received such awesome killer service! Not only was I treated special on my day but the food and service were absolutely outstanding!!  There were a lot of people for happy hour but I was able to get a table rather quickly, the drinks and the price of the happy hour menu are fantastic!! I will be back many many times this place has moved up to the top of the list of favorite places here in the Arcadia area where the list of great restaurants are endless. Everyone from the host, the bartender, and my server made sure that this visit was an awesome experience Thank You Buck and Rider you all are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Don't go for Happy Hour unless you want to sit inside. Went to enjoy the beautiful patio weather and their outdoor bar was closed. Also, only the inside bar has food HH prices...seems odd. All servers seemed annoyed to be working. Was unfortunate because I love their sister restaurant.  I have been before for dinner, and if you're a fresh seafood lover you'll enjoy it the menu.  **UPDATE** The manager went above and beyond to make the situation right and us feel welcome. Thanks Buck & Rider, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely spectacular. The ambiance is uniquely perfect for Arcadia.  I am sure this place is going to be a big hit!  Started off with oysters. The steak and the halibut was amazing.  Desert just showed up.  I'm told the cake is \"pretty awesome.\"  I'm working on the six pack secret diet, not giving in to temptation tonight....  French pressed coffee is great, I usually don't like coffee.   I'd highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about their happy hour. Absolutely the best value I have ever experienced. The raw oysters were half price and were all fresh and tasty. There were 4 different varieties to choose from and all were good. Served properly with cocktail sauce and raw horseradish. Oh and the fried chicken was off the charts! Did I mention that the service at the bar was also spot on? Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"If you love a nice variety of fresh oysters on \"happy hour\" at lunch, $7 Cava and sitting outdoors on a lovely patio, then this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"Really fresh and great tasting oysters. Fantastic outdoor seating and view of Camelback Mountain.  This is a great new LGO production. Order the cornbread it's almost like a desert."}
{"text":"I came in for an early Christmas dinner with my grandmother and could not have been happier. We ordered most the appetizers on the menu everything was cooked well, our server who I wish I could remember her name was excellent; attentive, knowledgeable, and kind. Chef Greg Wiener came and asked how our food was and talked to us about the beautiful sea food they were using and it just made the experience. Would definitely return 6-star experience."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving it one star is because I enjoyed the two males Hosts and bartenders while sitting at bar before dinner.  My fiancé and I had a nice table outside.  Waitress bragged about their dessert.  Dinner was so so (don't even remember what I ordered because I will never go back) and when we wanted dessert, our waitress literally said they ran out and it was only 9pm??? Really?  Made me think it either they ordered it from somewhere and ran out OR she was so bad of a Server and forgot to mention how amazing dessert was and we better order and save a piece.  She wasn't good.  Smile was great but that's about it. We typically leave 30% tip, we only gave about 15% tip because experience was so bad. I can't recommend this place and we won't be coming back. Kiddos to the bartenders and hosts!!! Hope you all can keep it real!"}
{"text":"Lousy service mediocre food my boyfriend ordered steak and lobster they did not even take the lobster off the tale for him we will go back to Ocean club a little bit more money but certainly worth the price"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to hang with friends. Atmosphere is so cute with tons of outdoor seating and the food is so yum! Sushi, oysters, and amazing cocktails. Service was spot on... Perfectly attentive but not intrusive.  Always a favorite of mine. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is wonderful. Surprisingly in this little hideaway, it has a view of Camelback mountain, a cozy garden-like patio and the freshest seafood in town. Great for groups as  it does get loud."}
{"text":"Came in with high expectations that were exceeded by the service but not quite met by the food.   We were greeted warmly by the host, who told us we could pick our own table. Our waitress,  Christina was warm, friendly, checked on us sufficiently and exceeded our service expectations.  -Diego Rivera cocktail was light, tasty, & refreshing (Christina's recommendation)  -Spicy avocado roll was light and tasty. I would order again  -Calamari was bland and a little soggy  -Beef Tartare was lacking in flavor -Crab wedge salad was light and was better when  I added some salt and pepper.  -Lemon Meringue Pie was light , fluffy, and delicious!!!  The restaurant & ambience on the patio was beautiful"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding pasta dish - and be sure to get the Calimari, which is awesomely spicy. The service was great and the ambience was fun. I'd definitely make it a point to come back here next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"My first bachelor party night in Phoenix and it started off with a bang! Buck and Rider delivered on everything a restaurant could possibly do. We had reservations at 8 pm but they were running a bit behind so we made our way over to the bar area. I am huge fan of Chopin vodka but my buddies said Kettle One was way better. So the bartender gave us free blind vodka tasting shots to see if we could taste the difference between the two. I lost the bet guessing as my Chopin turned out to be Kettle One. I mean vodka looks exactly the same in a shot glass and in my defense I had been drinking for 5 hours now. Once we were seated the server was amazing she took our drink orders even though we all had full drinks and recommended some amazing apps. The steak tartare with leaves, and the crab cakes (large pieces of crab) were mouth watering good. As I kept drinking the night got louder (the restaurant has a great sound system and they def showed it off). For dinner I went with the filet medium well. Probably one of the top 3 best cuts of filet I have ever had in my life. This is my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix and I can't wait to come back very very very soon! Thanks for a great bachelor party kickoff!!"}
{"text":"5 STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH . . . just had an incredible dinner at Buck & Rider and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the atmosphere beyond perfect staring at Camellback Mountain during a fall sunset, but the food was off-the-charts amazing. We had wonderful oysters, a crab dip that is second to none and the most luscious cornbread imaginable along with fine wines and creative mixes of drinks I have never even considered. This is certainly the culmination of a lifetime of industry expertise coming together for LGO Hospitality and I strongly recommend you try Buck and Rider sooner than later.  Well done . . .   Murf"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. In fact, for the first half of my visit I did very much. I love raw bars and have eaten at them all over the world, from the finest dining locations to a shack next to a wharf.  The thought of a so far highly acclaimed raw bar being just down the street from my house was exciting. We had tried to get in during the dinner rush before to no avail, so I came in during the slower mid-afternoon lunch hour.   I had a selection of oysters and shrimp, which were all fresh, firm, and delicious. There's an extensive wine and cocktail list. The server was knowledgeable and attentive. I ordered a stone crab claw and that's when things went south. The stone crab claw meat was slimy and separated from the shell, with a gelatinous sheen on it. It smelled strongly of ammonia and the taste was impossible to stomach. After attempting two bites I discreetly let the server know I thought the claw wasn't fresh, quietly described the texture, flavor and smell issues, and sent it back. No big deal so far.  At this point the server silently took the crab claw back into the kitchen. He came out minutes later to inform me that the chef had examined and tried the claw and felt it was fresh. He explained they do freshness checks every morning. He suggested that perhaps the flavor of this crab was too just intense for me.  Basically, despite the slimy, smelly crab in front of us, I must be mistaken or not have good enough taste.  He did take the uneaten claw off my bill but the whole experience soured me on this place. First, the crab had clearly turned as evidenced by the texture and strong ammonia smell. The flavor was unbearable. If the chef feels that that is fresh, then there are bigger problems in the kitchen of this seafood restaurant. Second, there was no need to try and lecture me about when crab is good, or when it's bad. I'm the customer, it wasn't to my liking, and that's what matters. And I'll tell you, from my experience eating shellfish all over the world: this was bad. Finally, about ten hours later at home in my bathroom I had what I think is confirmation it was no good. I won't get into details but it was not a pleasant night. While I guess I can't definitively pinpoint the culprit the crab is definitely a \"person of interest.\" I wonder if the chef who \"tried\" the crab had a similar night, and if so, whether he or she would like to revise their conclusion.   Again, I went in excited for excellent seafood close to home,  and had a great time up until this episode. Now I can say I'm never going back. There are other places around town--many more than there were a few years ago--that offer the raw bar experience. and they won't be obstinate if something is off. You can decide on your own but we're choosing to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"They charged my credit card more that what I authorized at the time of the meal.  Unsure whether this was some type of honest mistake or a deceitful increase in the bill."}
{"text":"Phenomenal choice for brunch! They have an amazing raw bar and the best crab cake Benedict I have ever had (and I'm a Florida girl and a stickler for quality seafood). The service was great: quick, and friendly but never rushed. The bottomless grapefruit mimosas were delicious and the server really kept them coming. Chef Luis really does an amazing job! I hope to come back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Went for the anniversary on Sunday night. There was half price select sushi rolls and half off bottles of wine. We ordered the \"Absent Minded Professor\" at our waiter's recommendation. So delicious. It ended up being $13.5 for a bottle and 2 glasses of wine each. It allowed us to splurge on the meal. We also ordered the PEI mussels for an ap. The broth was amazing; I wanted a spoon and the little chunks of chorizo, the hubs and I fought over. He ordered a surf and turf (filet and lobster tail) and I ordered the scallops over polenta. At first I was disappointed in the size of my meal. It was four medium sized scallops. But with the polenta and mushrooms, and bacon and all of it, it ended up being perfect. I was completely full, not able to get dessert, but my plate was clean. Oh, and it was plate scraping delicious. Also a waiter suggestion. So I say GO! And ask your waiter's for suggestions. They really know the food well! And if you can swing it, go on Sunday and get a bottle of wine! They are all reasonable priced."}
{"text":"From pretentious hostess, incompetent and unattentive server, average food."}
{"text":"I've been to Buck and Rider twice. The last time I went it was during happy hour on a Sunday. It was pretty packed. We sat at one of the high tops which is kind of uncomfortable. There are no backs on the seats. Our server got really busy really quick and took a while to take our orders. The food is really good in the portion sizes are pretty large. The happy hour menu is very reasonably priced and is a great value for what you receive."}
{"text":"The service always is wonderful here and we typically go for the oysters as the happy hour is one of the best deals in town and there's always a great vibe! Last time we went we had a lobster on happy hour for $18! I'd recommend the happy hour for sure!"}
{"text":"Buck & Rider is one of my new favorite local restaurants!    To start, the views of Camelback Mountain from the patio are absolutely stellar.  Sitting outside with the strung lights, and the fireplace just create such a beautiful atmosphere.  And the food is also outstanding! I am currently obsessed with the Thai King Crab Salad (big pieces of crab, fresh mango, peanuts, avocado....order it, you will not be disappointed), and you can taste the freshness of the fish in all the other dishes.  If you're looking to test this place out, I highly recommend coming on a Sunday evening when they do their sushi and wine specials (1/2 off a few of their specialty rolls and bottles of wine).  Fantastic atmosphere, food and service.  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome seafood best I have had quite possibly !! Killer drinks and holy smokes the oysters are insane !! A must when on camelback road"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the food was good.  The style seems so much like a lot of the other venues.  It was kind of loud too."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere! I like how it's upscale everything with a chill vibe! It's family friendly with that romantic vibe."}
{"text":"Group of 10 of us and had 2 servers that provided extraordinary service. Everything I had I would order again. Loved this place!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try,but..description of lobster sushi roll did not include the coleslaw in it and the mayo sauce all around.Raw oysters were good after they replaced one, but the $3each shrimp were over cooked and not deveined..The halibut cevichi was the best dish of the night with lots of yummy fish and a surprising veggie combination. The clam pasta dishes I had was too, too much Oil! My husband had the shrimp  and sausage pasta that was very tasty. Fish was fresh, but did not come close to my expectations. We will stick with LGO the next time we visit from Flagstaff.."}
{"text":"I LOVE the ambiance of this place. My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary and we wanted to bring our dog since it was also his birthday. We chose this place because not only did it have good reviews, but it was dog friendly! Food was really good and the customer service was amazing. Everyone was really nice!! The pricing was a little expensive but that was expected. I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after seeing my friend's photos from her brunch of crab cake Benedict and oysters.   Unsure of what to order during midday, I asked the chef and was recommended the Radio Milano Pasta Troife and a small order of the Savage Blonde oysters. Done and done! I also snagged myself a glass of Aunt Charlie while I waited and did a bit of people watching. The drink was very strong even though it was on happy hour, which was stellar. Speaking of things that are out of this world: oysters. You must get them. Just do yourself a favor. I mean, they're half off at happy hour, so why wouldn't you? Crisp and delicious toppings that only enhance the natural flavor.  When my Radio Milano showed up, the server warned me the plate was still warm. Oh yeah definitely, I gotcha. No touching. I'm no dummy. So I stir up my pasta, blow on it a bit, and promptly burn my tongue. I literally did this no less than three more times because it tasted so freaking good that I couldn't care that I was losing feeling in my taste buds. Guys, I learned I'm a real dummy that day. Learn from my mistakes.   I can't wait to come back here and get brunch on the patio. The seafood is so incredibly fresh and everything was delicious. I'd say this is a fabulous place to impress your fish lovin' date.... either at night or the morning after."}
{"text":"Everything goes right when we are there.  Valet is super convenient for starters. Love the atmosphere.  Happy hour in the bar is great but only in the bar.  It is a bit loud but hey, a crowded restaurant is loud.  Got a martini for starters.  It was good but my only complaint.  It was way too heavy with vermouth.  It was delayed a couple minutes and came after everyone else got their drinks and the bar manager comped them.  Now that's service!  Oysters are always delish. I got crab cakes that were fabulous as well.  Brussels spouts are a must if you go there.  So good.  My girlfriend got a filet that was cooked to perfection and oh so tender.  Pull apart rolls are just silly good.  It was my birthday so I got a desert. Lemon meringue pie...wow...I'm a bit of a pie snob but this stuff was epic."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour for food( I don't drink alcohol but I'm sure it's good for that too).  Fun bar , nice patio.   Oysters are the best and at happy hour they have awesome specials."}
{"text":"Wow - what can I say ? Ashley in the bar and Amanda our server were both outstanding. We came here for our anniversary tonight after an \"ok\" experience about a year ago. The atmosphere was lively and inviting. We visited both the bar and the patio and we were treated like special guests everywhere we went. The appetizers and drinks were delicious and I have to say the chicken was sinful. We were treated to a special dessert after a great conversation with Amanda about the joys of marriage . We will define lately be back as this is right In our backyard and now we are big fans of this place. Well done everyone !"}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype. We went there last night after getting a $25 comp from the owner and ordered steaks. They were well done, the service was great, and the decor was awesome."}
{"text":"Sea food is fresh and high quality. Definitely this is the best sea food place in Arizona ! Cool looking place with a great ambiance. The shrimp with chorizo is delicious. Also, the alaska king grab legs very yummy (not the typical casino/buffet style that you find in arizona). The merengue dessert is delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent. Delicious. Absolutely stunning food choices. As a lover of seafood (and a picky one at that), I have been anxious to try this place. My husband surprised me last night and took me here for our date night! We started off with a side of fries for our appetizer and then both ordered our entrees. My husband got the shrimp pasta and I got the scallops. What looked like a small portion size ended up filling us full! We had no room for dessert (and that rarely happens..haha). We both enjoyed our meals. The scallops were hands down the most perfectly-cooked I have ever tasted. They were on a creamy bed of polenta and garnished with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, baked peas (strangely good and crunchy), and onions. Every flavor combined to make one of the most enjoyable meals I've had! LGO hospitality, you've done it again and for that, my husband and I are grateful. I highly recommend this place and any other LGO concept. You will not be disappointed.   P.s. Be sure to read the menu with prices before going. We did this so we knew that it was going to be a pricy meal. Yelpers, it is seafood...what else do you expect? Do not let the negative reviews on here of their food being expensive stop you from going. Save up a bit, go for a special occasion, anything, and enjoy yourselves!! We highly recommend treating yourself to this place."}
{"text":"Very pricey for what you get. Have done happy hour a couple of times which makes it a little more reasonable. We've had one meal here that was five stars and one that was barely two stars so not sure if we had a bad experience or if it's just inconsistent. The decor is great and patio is nice when it's not summer."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Only thing was it came out super fast. Felt rushed all night. We told waitress to slow entree but it came out with appetizer"}
{"text":"Yum!  Everything was delicious!  We ordered so much food, because we couldn't decide what to get.  There were so many fantastic options. The seafood was as fresh as you can get. I can't wait to go back!  The waitstaff were true professionals & were very attentive.  I highly recommend Buck & Rider to anyone who wants to experience a fantastic night out."}
{"text":"So we usually try and give new restaurants a little time before going to them, but we couldn't help ourselves...we had to get here for at least an app and drink! The new building is beautiful and it was BUSY. We were seated immediately though and had a great waitress. The menu is reasonable with the amount of selections and everything looked so good!  The sushi looked beatiful when it came out and we will have to try it at some point, but we didn't want our first experience to be with that. We went for the tuna tostadas and the pull apart bread. The tostada was amazing! The fish was fresh and just slightly grilled but pretty and pink on the inside. It actually had a good kick to it! They had corn and some other yummy items and flavors mixed in. The table next to us had the pull apart bread and it just looked too good, we had to get it. It seems silly to want to order a basic item like bread, but it was the most amazing bread...like ever! It is salty and buttery and perfect because we used it to sop up the remaining stuff from the tostada.   This is definitely on the pricier side, but for the quality of seafood you are getting, it is so worth it. It is flown in daily and they actually get it from the same place the Plaza gets it apparently. Really well done and a great new place in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Simply the best seafood in Phoenix. Pan fried Loup de Mer was fabulous, the sauce divine. Broccolini was done expertly, crisp. Oyster and sauces superb. My wife's tuna was yum-O! One usually has to fly to San Fran to get this quality seafood. I've been to every seafood restaurant in town and Finally! This is the one!"}
{"text":"The food was average, however, the service was horrid. My lady is Latino and I am a Black American male and we felt negativity even though the manager was Black as well. He went over to all tables except ours and it wasn't even crowded. Craziness abound..."}
{"text":"The beef tartare here was delicious, although it did look a little brown compared to beef tartare I've had at other places. The lobster roll was also shockingly good because I didn't know what to expect from a seafood roll with mango, but it added a nice texture. The pasta I got was yummy and acidic from the tomatoes but much too greasy! My boyfriend got the breaded sea bass, which was good too but overpriced. It came out looking like the tilapia filets you can get at Costco (super small!). The butter sauce was amazing though.  We ordered the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato for dessert and even though we did expect it to be rich, it was hellaaaa thicc. It was like a truffle and difficult to eat, but the chocolate was bittersweet, just the way I like it.  The restaurant itself was packed and bustling, so it had a very comfortable ambience. It was just a little cold because we were sitting under a ceiling fan. The host was super friendly and valet is complimentary!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! I didn't know anything about the restaurant, had not read any reviews, and wasn't told what to expect by a friend who recommended the place.  I ordered appetizers, the house wine, and dessert.  I also had a few bites of my friends crabcake entrée. It was all excellent I would highly recommend the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Great service if it's seafood u want this is the place. Great selection of fresh oysters. But they have steak tar tar as well as unique find."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start.   They got us a table 15 before are reservation which was nice but after that it was down hill.    Sat us and we literally sat there for 10 mins before anyone finally asked us if we wanted to order a drink.  Wife had wine and I had ice tea.   I was asked if I would like sweetener I said yes the T came with out sweetener she had forgotten it and walked away I had to ask another waitress for sweetener.   I ordered a whole lobster and they forgot to bring me any thing to break lobster up.    Finally, once we were done we sat there another 10 mins waiting for our bill.      To sum it up, service is bad and food mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for over a year. We finally made it for a late lunch just after 1:00pm. Happily, they were having happy hour!  Since I am a huge fan of bubbly with oysters I ordered both and they were all on happy hour. The Cava, which is a Spanish sparking wine if you aren't familiar, was refreshing and dry, the way I like it. The oysters were priced at $3.50 each but were half price on happy hour. I chose 2 Crisp Critters and 2 Sunberry Point. All of which were on the smaller side (which I love) they were sweet and tasty and oh, so fresh!  My husband and I shared some VooDoo fried rice. Yum! And, we shared 2 sushi rolls that were out of this world delish and unique. We don't care for the overbearing taste of Nori (seaweed wrap) and were thrilled to learn they also have soy paper as an option so we went with that. We had the Crunchy Shrimp Roll and the Crab and Macadamia roll.  The happy hour is from open until 7:00 pm. You can't beat that so get in here!  I can't wait to come back and try some of their other selections, like their fresh fish and the seafood combinations which are made up of oysters, king crab, lobster, shrimp and razor clams!  OMG, seafood nirvana in central Phoenix. \"Phoenix Seafood\" is no longer an oxymoron!  Thanks to Samantha B for the friendly service also."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was eclectic. Service was absolutely awesome with Lindsey. Seafood was cooked to perfection. Would recommend to friends and family. Definitely five stars!"}
{"text":"Of all the places in PHX we love Buck & Rider because they are consistent no matter if you are dining for lunch or dinner or just there for happy hour ( excellent btw)  An oyster lovers paradise!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy Happy Hour at B&R! Mon-Sat until 7pm and all day Sunday!! $7 cocktails and $6 wines, draft beers and highball cocktails. $8 apps- amazing options!! Oyster bar and mostly seafood options- we opted for the California roll and Brussel Sprouts- both of which were delicious. Fish is flown in daily fresh. It was clear the crab in the Cali Roll was straight off the boat. Brussels had an apple gastrique, chopped almonds and goat cheese side dip. Both were delicious. Also really enjoyed the house Chardonnay on HH!"}
{"text":"We had the perfect breakfast. Crab eggs Benedict and their fantastic gumbo. Staff was great and timed everything so we never felt rushed or waiting. We love this place. Not bad cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"We love coming for dinner and happy hour during the week. The food and service are always consistent- except for the new mussels, not crazy about those!- it's our favorite neighborhood stop and always run into our friends at the bar. The patio is great on weekends for brunch and mimosas too"}
{"text":"Went for a Happy Hour with my daughter and sister.  Checked in with the valet staff before entering and told that their Happy hour today, being Saturday would end at 6.  We mosey to the bar...place our order and then informed it is a reverse happy hour due to a weekend nite...Really.....a bit of a communication problem...hope they get it corrected.....K"}
{"text":"Sunday Happy Hour ALL day, do I need to say more! 1/2 priced Oysters and Lobsters and 1/2 priced small assortment of Appetizers along with cocktails and beers. We've been here on other Happy Hour days, but I think because it's all day on Sunday it doesn't get quit so packed, a stream of people throughout the day, maybe?  I can only speak for Happy Hour seating at the bar is very good along with service. The Happy Hour selection is very good. My friend and I had a dozen Buck & Rider Oysters, Steak Tartare, and the Dixie Chicken Fingers. My only complaint and I don't know why: The Flies are out of control in the Bar area, the 3 times we've been there so far (always sitting at the bar by the back entrance). I don't like flies near me or landing near my food. Maybe fly strips or something?  Atmosphere: very nice, Food: very good, Service very good"}
{"text":"First time there and, if you just Google the place, it says they open at 11:00 but they don't. The correct hours are on their website = they open at 11:30. We arrived at 11:00 and the staff could not have been more gracious. They let us sit inside at the bar, gave us water and took our order before 11:30. I was there for 2/12 hours - first met family member who had to leave for an appointment and a friend came later and we hung out. We ate at the bar- great happy hour. Great drinks and wonderful oysters ! I highly recommend this comfortable inviting and accommodating new place on Camelback."}
{"text":"It's a five star review and will be back again for sure.   Let's start off with the dozen oysters. They were small but delicious. The price might be high but worth it. This comes from someone who just likes big oysters. It could be just because I was raise on the gulf.   Next on to the entrees that we had for brunch. The crab cakes Benedict were the bomb. This isn't your traditional over fried crab cake. It was browned just nice with a creamy spinach mixture with the perfect egg Benedict. The egg was cooked just right soft and runny. The next thing we had was the soup of the day with the calamari. The soup was a corn chowder with fresh crab meat. You could taste the sweetness of the corn and the cream with the fresh crab meat from the bar. It was hands down one of the best chowders I have had. It can compete with a San Francisco chowder and even a New England chowder. Next on the list was the calamari. The sauce makes this dish. The Thai sauce is almost like a ponzu sauce which was different for me but it gave a new light to a traditional dish because no lemon was needed. The only downside for me was the batter for the calamari only because it was a bit gritty for me. They must use more of a cornmeal mixture, but I will not knock it because the flavor was there. Well seasoned and not bland or greasy.   We finished it off with the gelato. It was a pistachio and chocolate mix. It tasted homemade and not overly sweet. This is up my alley because I am not the sweets person.    Service was great even though we had a new server in training. She was attentive and even her trainer was filling in with grace.   This place is refreshing to the valley because I have yet to find this fresh of seafood."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere during lunch. Beautiful view of camelback through outdoor patio. Lemon meringue pie was amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Father's day with a group of 7 (5 adults, 2 teenagers) and left in a food coma. Service was awesome. I had the the crabcake benedict from the brunch menu and they were not stingy with the crab which is hard to come by.   Try the $6 hash brown! 3 of us shared it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and drinks at Buck and Rider! The atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about cocktails. Laura the GM  checked up on us and made sure everything was fine! To be honest, this spot probably has the best cocktails in the Phoenix area! I highly recommend this spot for great food and drinks! Plus a whole lot of friendly and beautiful people."}
{"text":"So I've eaten here many times (we live close by).   If anyone from the restaurant reads these reviews, I hope the pay attention.   1. This place is really loud. It's hip and cool but really, learn sign language if you want to eat here.  2. Salt. Someone needs to steal the salt from the kitchen. Most recipes say \"add a pinch of salt.\" This kitchen kills the great ingredients and flavors with heaps of salt.  3. Service. The restaurant wasn't busy tonight and the service was awful. We sat for 30 minutes before our waitress decided to take our order. She was new, but for heaven's sake, help her out management.  If you love hip and trendy, this is a great place. We've visited 8-10 times in the last year and I have a feeling that this was our last visit."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was just as good as the last. First time I came for dinner and we had the calamari and crab cake appetizer. They were both so unique and amazing. Our  meals were wonderful too. Today we did brunch. They did not disappoint with the bottomless mimosas and my omelette and hash browns were perfect. The staff was attentive to all of us including going out of their way to do extra special things for the little baby in the group. This was above what they had to do and it left a great impression. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails and sushi! I'd definitely recommend coming for happy hour and sitting outside. This place is beautiful and the food was good!"}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! If you love seafood this place is amazing! Great atmosphere too!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent! It's one of my top 10 restaurants in town. Great drinks, great food, and tremendous Staff. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"We were served a \"bad\" oyster (I will spare u the details regarding the smell), unfortunately my husband ate it and things went down from there. We spoke with the manager on duty and he apologized and removed the oysters off our bill (how nice!) however didn't feel the need to comp the TWO drinks we had. We swore we would never return. I finally emailed the head honcho and got an immediate response with an invitation to return and we would be taken care of..not sure if that meant a free dessert or what. We returned last night and had an excellent experience. We were treated like celebrities and had our entire meal including drinks and dessert compted (sp?). I'm a sucker for customer service, and will definitely be back in again..and will request Shea, our very attentive and hilarious server. Thank you LGO hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place; its been on my radar for awhile. I finally made it across town in the crazy rush hour traffic for their famous happy hour. Everything started out good..until... the place got a little busy. Bartenders couldn't keep up. However, I was okay with that. I was with good company eating fresh seafood that was half price OR so I thought.  We loaded up on the seafood..you can't not when it's half price and one of the only places in town to get it fresh.  $200 later the three of us were full...and ready to go..when we noticed our bill was completely wrong we were over charged by $70. After waiting 15-20 mins to get a bartenders attention to ask what was up with our bill...He tells us \"everyone is confused by their bill\" and its been a continuing problem, but he agrees to look at the bill... He then apologize bcus he finds a few errors. He changed most of it, but didn't fix it all.. after waiting another 20mins.. we gave up and paid the bill. Left a 20% tip in cash ($40). Then later found out that someone added their own tip to my credit card after the fact. Even though the seafood was pretty darn good, I don't think I would return. Too much confusion, inconsistency,  and overall bad service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everything on the menu is delicious. The seafood is fresh, the appetizers are unique and delicious, and the craft cocktails are absolutely fantastic. The service is also very good. The servers are attentive and knowledgeable. By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wonderful cocktails (and a very complete bar).  There were three of us and we ordered a bunch of small plates rather than an entree.  We had a few oysters & shrimp plus a stone crab from the raw bar; all were fresh and beautifully prepared.  Then we had the crab dip, the Brussels sprouts, two sushi rolls (crab and shrimp), criiscalamari, and the lobster rolls \"nik niks\".  We really wanted to keep going, but were so wonderfully full we needed to stop.  Next time I want to try the snapper ceviche."}
{"text":"My man and I stopped into this place for lunch during our trip to AZ and it was a good find. Ample parking with complimentary valet. We sat in the bar area for happy hour and there was a good crowd on that Saturday afternoon. They offer 1/2 off certain appetizers. Here's what we tried: - grilled Brussels sprouts with goat cheese - delicious and a big serving.. would definitely order again - steak tartar - not impressive whatsoever - giant prawns - cold w/ cocktail sauce (good) or grilled (better! I would definitely have them grilled again :) Huge, meaty prawns..  - salmon roll - tasted fresh.. good choice too - oyster sampler - can't go wrong with oysters! - rib eye w/ caramelized carrots - excellent! The meat was so flavourful even to the center of the piece. Would definitely order this again :)  We also had an IPA and the Ommission Pale Ale.. both were good. The only negative thing I could note about the place were the aggressive flies at the tables stationed at the back of the bar (they keep the front doors open to let the breeze in). If there weren't any flies, I wild have give this place a near perfect score. The food was pretty solid overall."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Went out of their way to make sure our toddler was comfortable during a Happy Hour rush giving us a table in the dining area instead of a high table and even a warm cookie. The brussel sprouts with warm goat cheese was so delicious and the kid's platter is probably the best and most well-balanced kids meal I've ever ordered with the addition of pea shoots, super sweet and crunchy carrots perfectly cut for little hands and a bunch of grapes. Highly recommend based on courteous staff and presentation alone."}
{"text":"We are back in town and couldn't resist a trip to our favorite spot in Phoenix! And, it remains on the top of our list. In addition to our favorite appetizer of Brussel sprouts, we have added the hush puppies and wedge salad to our favorites. And who can resist the pull apart dinner rolls?! The drinks and wine were wonderful. I had the filet. Delicious and perfectly cooked. The steak sauce is incredible. My husband had the salmon. Equally delicious.  Other guests had the Sea bass, Burger and another wedge salad (because she didn't get enough during the appetizer course.) Everyone was happy. There's a great vibe to this place, busy, cozy, fun with great food and drinks. Angie was lovely and attentive. And I mean, chocolate cake and lemon meringue pie. Bam. We'll be back....again."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on the weekend and had a wonderful experience. The ambience is very nice, with a cute outdoor patio that opens into the restaurant and a bar in the center.   We had so much trouble deciding what to eat since everything looked delicious! They have a brunch menu as well on the weekends, but the lunch menu seemed more enticing since there were more seafood options.   We started with the Pan Roasted Mussels which is one of the best mussel dishes we've ever had- such plump juicy mussels!  From their sushi menu we had the Lobster Tobanjan Roll. I liked that it tasted very light and fresh. It doesn't have a particular strong flavor though.   We also had the Thai Style Crab Salad which was to die for and I highly recommend. It had just the right amount of light citrus tang and peanut flavor with generous cuts of Crab. Perfect flavor combination. I don't normally find salads delicious but I gobbled this one right up.   Food came out quickly and service was great.   I loved how they gave us mini-cookie samples on the way out! They sell delicious cookies by the door."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal brunch! Came here with a large group and got to try several of their entrees, apps, and drinks, and all of them were delicious! They have a large trendy indoor space as well as a beautiful outdoor patio. Service was a bit slow but we had a big group so it was understandable.  In terms of food, here is what I tried: - Cocktails (5/5): I got a bloody mary which was hearty and flavorful, and also tried my friend's \"Greyhound\" (gin and grapefruit), which was really smooth and delicious as well. - Voodoo fried rice (5/5): great for sharing! Really tasty fried rice with shrimp and chicken, and just the right amount of spice from gojuchang (korean spicy paste).  - Crab cake benedict (5/5): one of the best crab cakes I've had in a long time, filled with large chunks of crab. Poached eggs and hollandaise were done just right also.  - Port St. Lucie fish sandwich (4/5): probably about as good as a fish sandwich can be, although paled in comparison to the other dishes. The fries were very thin and well-seasoned though.   This place can be a bit more on the pricey side, but well worth it in my opinion, and a great place to celebrate special occasions!"}
{"text":"Jonathan is one of the sweetest most kind individuals I have ever met. The hospitality at Buck and Rider is unsurpassed. Who would have thought we would find such a gem in the middle of Phoenix, for some of the best seafood I have had in years. I work at the airport in louisville and will deffinately be recommending Buck and Rider to anyone traveling to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Some meals leave you satisfied, some meals leave you happy, and then there is the rare meal that leaves you elevated and last in your memory as what you are looking for in every other meal.  I am writing this at the table minutes after having such a meal at 'Buck & Rider\".  Five friends and I had dinner here and shared six dishes and two desserts.  One friend had to put her head in her hands during the lemon meringue pie because it was just that good.  We had:  NY strip, The Hong Kong Halibut, A Yuku Crab Roll, Roasted Chicken, Troife Pasta, and Blackened Snapper.  The restaurant is beautiful and our server Ariana was really knowledgeable and fun.  Look, you're reading this to see if you should go...do yourself the favor of finding a meal you'll be looking for for years to come and GO!"}
{"text":"Terrific service, amazing food and I love the half price deal at the bar. The bartender literally wouldn't allow me to order a glass of wine without giving me a taste first. Delicious oysters, lobster, sauces...you can't go wrong with this spot."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. I have passed it tons of times so glad I caved to the feeling and finally paid this place a visit. The seafood is fresh and I was told it is flown in daily. The lobster roll was unbelievably soft and sooo tender. I can say I am not a huge fan of California rolls but their Cali rolls have been on my mind. The food quality makes a huge difference when making a meal. This place was really affordable. The bill hit about 150. I had wine, oysters, shrimp, lobster rolls, fish, cake, and 2 other drinks that was a friend of mines but this place is great. Good quality. Excellent Price. Friendly staff. This one has left a lasting impression for me && I tend to tell it like it is *shrugs*"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!!  Service was impeccable and the best I have had in a very long time!  The menu is varied, but the restaurant DOES specialize in seafood/fish as the name indicates.  I got the tuna burger which was excellent.  It comes with cold slaw, but the server gave me the option of substituting a small salad or friend.  I chose the salad which was good size and tasted fresh.    It was a little pricey for lunch, but I didn't mind paying the price for the service, the food, and the ambience.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Desperately wanted to be impressed!  I and a friend visited and here's what we found:  Friendly staff.  A seat at the bar right in front of the drink-pouring action.  Some dishes fantastic - a couple dishes and one drink that weren't so much.  Poor service unless we asked for something - in spite of 3 people working directly in front of us.  A lovely happy hour with great deals and that runs from 11 AM to 7 PM - but you can NOT sit on the patio and partake of the food deals.  Hits included sensational raw oysters, out of this world snapper cerviche, hot crab dip, hot french fries served with honey mustard, and a wonderful Manhattan knock-off - (For Love or Money) - replete with Buffalo Trace bourbon!   Misses included the Spicy Tuna Rolls (no pizzaz), Mussels( slightly fishy, several nearly closed shells, very little flavor in the meat or tomato broth).  In addition, the gin and tonic didn't taste like gin - or tonic.  It started off slow (early evening) and got busier, but it wasn't ever full. The staff knew us for the first 15 minutes, thereafter if we needed ANYTHING, we had to work to get their attention.  We tried it - we sort of liked it - now we're off to greener pastures.  No need to repeat it."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere and even better food!! The raw oysters are top notch so is their calamari! Great service and amazing cookies!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Sat at the bar, Nicole was our bartender/server, she was awesome!!! Food was very good, atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant for weekend lunch and service was very good.  My dining partner loved his food but I did not because it was waaaaaaay oversalted which is a first for me.  However, I think it was a one-time mistake and would definitely recommend Buck & Rider."}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about this place. Great service, fresh seafood, interesting flavors. The oyster bar for happy hour is truly the best!!"}
{"text":"I don't like seafood (I know, weird) but I love the atmosphere, service, drink menu and the fried chicken makes my tummy super happy!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their sister restaurants especially LGO so giving this place a try was easy...  The ambiance had a very classy old school undertone, while the music was very hip a bit of clash but the food compensated for it!   My bf and I had the crab dip app and it was delish! Every bit had a chunk of crab and the watermelon radish and endive were my favorite dippers adding a crunch to a meaty savory bite.   For the main course I had the sea scallops with risotto which was AMAZING! Tip for the wise: savor every bite, because at the end of your plate you will be disappointed there isn't more.   For dessert was the chocolate torte and pistachio ice cream...rich and decadent!   I will definitely be returning for their happy hour :)   So if you enjoy quality seafood, which is hard to find in the desert, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the BEST time here with my husband celebrating our anniversary! We had oysters, crab dip, ahi tuna burger, and French sea bass. Everything was phenomenal. The food came out quickly and staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Ambience is nice, drinks are great and the service was on point. I ordered various appetizers to share with a friend. It was all good except the gluten free chips that come with the crab dip would need to be changed. They crumble and break! Overall, good spot.. will return."}
{"text":"We arrived & they were closed for a private party. It would have been nice if they had posted something on their website or Yelp, as we checked both & drive 40 min to get there."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are big foodies. We know every good restaurant in town and we love oysters. For one I am a server myself and I swear by this restaurant that this place has the best food in Arizona. We had the lobster rolls with French fries . The best appetizer in the world. Then we started out with one dozen oysters , but then turned into two and a half dozen oysters. My boyfriend had the salmon and I had the surf and turf. The lobster was cooked to perfection. The service was completely incredible. Teresa and Anna are the ones I saw most. Teresa made sure that my boyfriend and I always had a filled up drink and asked if we needed anything else. Completely attentive and extremely kind. Anna had the greatest smile , and explained in detail when we had questions. Overall the whole staff asked us if we needed anything else , and we were never left without anything we needed. The best food in Arizona , and the most incredible service . My new favorite restaurant , you will see me once a week !"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite meal this trip to PHX. Adorable decor, super friendly service and the food was excellent! We had shrimp from the raw bar, avocado salad, clam chowder, lobster rolls and my favorite dish of the night crab macadamia nut sushi rolls. Delish! I also had the Hit the Road Jack cocktail which was just so-so, my husband had a craft beer he really liked, will check out the wine next time. They have free valet as the only parking option."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and food here. If you like oysters, this is your place in Scottsdale. I ordered the smallest oysters they had with all the accompaniments, ceviche, mussels and fries. The ceviche was ok but the rest were great. I will definitely be back. I also ordered One Night in Babylon. The cocktail was different, not my favorite. I then ordered Tom Collins which was great."}
{"text":"The food is incredible here and reasonably priced. You're definitely in for an amazing experience!!!  Unfortunately, the first time we went we had an issue with the bill and it took a little while to get resolved. But once we sent an email to LGO Hospitality they returned it with a more than generous gift card, sincere apology, and invited us back to dine on them. I am SO impressed with their willingness and confidence as a company to realize their mistakes, correct them, and gain more business from an original sub-par experience. We LOVE LGO and go often, (actually ate there last night!!) If you're looking for a good date night, celebration, or new restaurant to dine you should absolutely pick this one. They will not let you down!   We had oysters as an appetizer. From someone that loves oysters and is from the gulf I'm very particular. They were very small- but super fresh and yummy!  We hen split the avocado salad. The kalamata olives make it salty and the dressing and avocado make it fresh and the tomatoes a good sweet bite. Amazing.  I had the pasta- very obviously in house made noodles with fresh shrimp and herbs. My mouth is watering it was so good!   My boyfriend had the scallops and polenta--nothing short of spectacular. The scallops were fresh and perfectly tender and sweet. The creamy salty polenta was the perfect combo.   My boyfriend had the buck & rider rue cocktail and I will definitely be ordering that next time.   Can't wait to go back! Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Amazing french pressed coffee. Multiple kinds of benedict eggs, we got the classic and the artichoke - will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Wow my new favorite spot!  Service 5 star Food 5 star Happy Hour 5 star will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Buck & Rider for her Birthday! It was our first time. Not sure what to expect! We started off with a cocktail. It was happy hour and they had some interesting recommendations. After a couple of questions we went for a creation close to an Old Fashion. OMG was it good! Had to have another. We looked over the menu and made a request to modify the surf and turf. The chef was gracious and accommodated our request. OMG the food is off the hook delicious. Fish is flown in fresh daily and the beef is butchered on site. Not only was everything fresh and delicious but the sauces were amazing. Being a purest I usually like my surf and turf simple. This dish with the sauce was over the top great!!!! We chose a wine with our dinner from Willamette Valley and capped off the evening with a grand dessert! Highly recommend if you are ever in Phoenix near the Sky Harbor Airport that you enjoy Buck & Rider!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today and truly one of the best meals I've had in awhile. The crab cake BLT and Baja style seafood cocktail were so delicious. Bottomless mimosas and great service have made this place one of my new favorites"}
{"text":"They have a great staff and delicious food!! They held private party for two friends that are getting married and did an amazing job!! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for delicious food and equally delicious drinks. They apparently have a really good oyster bar, but I'm not an oyster lady. So whatevs.... also a pretty decent happy hour. My only complaint, which gives it only 4-stars, is that happy hour is only valid in their bar which has around 20 seats. So it's always jam packed and you'll most likely have to stand around and hover over people to try to claim the spot when they leave. It's worse than a parking lot, where at least their you can use your blinker to indicate you've claimed that spot. Granted there are also 9 tabletops, but you have to put your name down for those. Oh and there's also happy hour seating outside. But seriously, who wants to sit outside in the summer?!? To end on a positive note, I love love love the Spicy Avocado Roll, Brussels Sprouts and Fried Rice. Mmmmm..... Their service is also top notch. :)"}
{"text":"Buck and Rider has a great happy hour! Their sushi and ceviche is absolutely incredible. Pair it with the house happy hour wine and you have a great meal. Although the rolls aren't on the happy hour menu, do yourself a favor and add a side of them.   The atmosphere is also incredible. I always feel like I'm going to walk out onto the sand when I leave buck and rider. My only complaint from the two visits I've been was one of the hostesses. He was extremely rude and made it very clear he did not want to help our large party find a happy hour table (aka get there a little early)."}
{"text":"Tried this place from a write up in a travel mag (which we normally don't do).  It was fabulous! Everything was fresh, with a great blend of flavors. The wood grill added the perfect char. The cocktails were on point. The service was great. Definitely needs to be in your chow list!"}
{"text":"Food. Was. Amazing. Finally found incredible seafood in Phoenix. Oysters were fresh and tasted great, calamari was crisp and perfectly cooked, the sushi roll was on par with the best of them and the chocolate cake was decadent! I will definitely return here and highly recommend others to check out this restaurant.  Lastly, the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"LGO has a recipe for food and atmosphere that works really well for me. Four of us decided to check out B&R Sunday evening and were not disappointed. We started with oysters and the lobster/macadamia roll. Oysters- not my thing but was assured they were fresh and creamy. The roll was nicely prepared, not overly large so that it's difficult to wedge in your mouth (ugh), and the ponzu sauce was light and slightly citrusy.   Two of us ordered the Thai Style Lobster Salad. It was a decent size, came with napa cabbage, cilantro, chunks of lobster, peanuts and a spicy vinaigrette. This was okay but did not knock my socks off. I would consider ordering it again but would definitely consider other options.  The crab cakes- now those have my vote! There were two large crab cakes chock full of crab, not fillers. They came with a nice side salad and were delicious. Definitely order these!  Another person in our group had the white fish of the day, in this case loup de mer. It was nicely prepared with a light breading, browned and served with well prepared broccolini.  We finished off with dessert, banana cream pie and lemon meringue. Now I love homemade banana cream pie. It takes me right back to grandma's. This is really a cream pie with bananas served on the side in a graham crust. Sigh. I need the bananas in the pie... and I like crust. It was okay, just not my style. The lemon meringue, however, surprised me. It is served in a graham pecan crust (with a hint of cinnamon?) and the lemon is more of a curd, very creamy, very tart. The meringue is more of a marshmallow than a traditional meringue. Normally meringue and marshmallow don't score very high with me, but I would have to make an exception for this.   We were all very satisfied with our experience and the food. Four out of four said they would be back!"}
{"text":"Had only been to this place once within the last year.  Visited this place twice in the last week - once for happy hour as I was in the area and another time for a birthday celebration.  They have a great whiskey selection - had Elijah Craig 18 and Thomas Handy Rye available for a reasonable price.  Both times the service was excellent.  We sat in the bar area both times and the drinks and food came out just when we needed it.  The group really enjoyed the shrimp hush puppies and the rocky point shrimp - both you can get at happy hour prices until 7pm.  Atmosphere at this place was fun and laid back.  A great spot in the Arcadia area if you are meeting up with friends for some drinks and bites."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment as a group of four.  the appearance is very visually appealing, we sat middle to the outside and inside of the establishment, the landscape outside was perfect with plenty of plants/flowers and beautiful patio work. the inside was equally as appealing with dim lighting and a really romantic feel without being to formal.  Our server was Angie, who was very sweet. she was knowledgeable of the menu and offered great suggestions for the table which we really appreciated and enjoyed. She also was very attentive to the table, by keeping the table clear of excessive plates and our water and silver wear was always set.   off the drink menu I had the \"Your Money or Your Life\" which was Bourbon with a Orange Bitter taste. Very tasty. Also tasted the \"One Night in Babylon\" with Opihr spiced gin, cucumber, za'atar. very refreshing and tasted great.   We all shared the dishes so we could try as much as possible because everything sounded so good. We started with 3 kinds of Oysters, the dips were fab. Avocado salad was so refreshing, the Crispy Brussels Sprouts with apple gastrique, roasted almonds was to-die-for with a goat cheese dipping sauce...it was my favorite! Also Amazing was the Pan Seared Scallops with creamy polenta, maitake mushrooms, English peas, cippoloni onion, pancetta and sun dried tomatoes and Baked Yuzu Crab Roll. My compliments to the chef.  I rated this 5 starts because it exceed what I expected from the drive by and the restaurant name. It was a wonderful, relaxing and a tasteful experience. I will be returning and recommending this place for date night or when friends are in town. If you check it our ask to sit in Angie's section, she's the best!"}
{"text":"As always, the oysters never fail to please. Happy Hour all day on Sunday so half off on oysters and shrimp. Oysters are flown in fresh daily so the fact that we're in the desert doesn't mean we don't have fresh seafood! The service could have been a tad bit better...I had to search for a waitress a few times and it wasn't that busy. But otherwise, another stellar experience!"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Buck and Rider, and we'll definitely be back.   Starting with convenient/friendly complimentary valet parking, this place just kept getting better.   Fun yet sophisticated ambience, with indoor/outdoor dining.  Cool music playing.  The menu is a diverse collection, from the Raw bar options, to fun apps, to sushi, fish and steaks.   We tried it all, and it was so delicious.   The staff was friendly and on their game.   Hats off to Buck and Rider.  You've got a new fan!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Best raw bar in Phoenix.  There, I said it.  Little Cleo's comes close, but I think Buck and Rider just edges them out.  Point of comparison is mostly to oysters, and when it comes to oysters, no one has beat out Hog Island in SF and 167 Raw in Charleston.  Buck and Rider comes very close to these, and for this and various other reasons, deserves its 5-star rating.  The first time we went, visited with another couple so we got to try a little of everything.  The stone crab claws we got were excellent.  And on a side note, 1/2 off all raw items at the bar during happy hour, which is a long happy hour here.  Another nod to the 5-stars.  Also ordered the mussels and mini-lobster rolls.  Mussels were above average, and despite the fact that these lobster rolls were over-sauced, they are pretty darn tasty.  Don't expect a truly authentic Maine lobster roll because you'll be disappointed, but with a little open-mindedness, these little guys can rock your world.  Entrees were the scallops, crab cakes, loup de mer, and Hong Kong style halibut.  My friend said the scallops were some of the best of her life, I agreed they were delicious.  The crab cakes were full of actual crab meat, so bonus points there.  My wife always orders loup de mer wherever she sees it and she said it was also one of the better ones she has had, to which i concur.  Finally, the halibut, which i ordered.  The fish was thick and cooked well, so credit there.  But in terms of the overall flavor of the dish - too much soy sauce.  It was the most one-dimensional \"Asian\" style sauce I've ever had.  That, and very minimal bok choy on the side, which soaked up all the soy sauce flavor, as did the rice, making kind of a salty mess.  If the sauce were to improve, I would rate this single dish as excellent but otherwise, it is mediocre to almost poor.  But all that being said, after a few visits, we still love this place.  The vibe is cool, the staff is friendly, and the food, with only a couple exceptions, has been excellent.  Here's to hoping they keep up their raw bar standards."}
{"text":"Ok.  Crowd was mainly stuffed like sardines into small tight space in the back to enjoy the happy hour menu. The rest of the place was DEAD. Wanted to love it, but it wasn't a comfortable set up and food was ok.  Nothing special. My standards are high.  I was envisioning an experience as good as The Water Grill in Santa Monica, CA.     The happy hour menu was VERY limited and food was pretty bland, but OK. The desert was amazing!  A big old piece of Key Lime.  Homemade and wonderful!"}
{"text":"I read so many good things about this place, I had to give it a try. Atmosphere was nice, but, food was overpriced and not that good. The crispy Brussels sprouts were huge and tough. I ordered the 1/2 lb king crab and the amount of crab was laughable. My assessment is too much money for food that is not that good. I will not return.  1/16/2018 After my previous Yelp review, I was contacted by Laura who apologized for our sub-par experience. She went out of her way to make things right and I experienced fantastic customer relations, which has not happened in a long time.  After her making things right, I will give them another go. Just on customer service and relations they are ok in my book."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and has a great rating here but my family and I were greatly disappointed. Buck and Rider did not live up to the hype. There were six of us and we started with the Brussel Sprouts, mussels, and calamari. The Brussels were solid and the tastiest dish of the night but some weren't charred all the way. The calamari was rubbery. Mussels were solid but nothing to write home about. Next Oysters. Fresh. Can't really mess that up. I had the crab cake which again solid but underwhelming. That seemed to be the theme of the night as everyone said the same of the scallops, sea bass, and grouper. It's a good restaurant with ok service. If you're looking just for mediocrity for a high price then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Went for a work dinner so I had the opportunity to try an assortment.  PROVISIONS: Salt & Pepper Crispy Calamari $13 *chewy, under seasoned and Thai dipping sauce was too sweet  Steak Tartare $18 *underwhelming and a bit bland, I also think I would've preferred the tartare on seasoned crackers, just ok  ROLLED SUSHI Baked Yuzu Crab Roll $16 Blue crab, topped with spicy tuna and Serrano peppers, soy paper *this roll had the essence of crab and I liked the heat from the peppers and the spicy tuna tasted really fresh, I ate every last piece  ENTREES Fresh Blue Crab Cakes $32 Pommery mustard sauce, gojuchang spice, summer squash with romesco *really confused by this dish!  I'm from Baltimore and these were a 1 on a scale of 1 to 100.  Awful.  No lump crabmeat (should've asked what part of the crab is used for the crab cakes).  They were shredded bottom of the barrel crab, and densely packed and no sweet crab flavor not to mention the accompaniments were so bold it completely overwhelmed the crab!  Don't waste $32, order something else.  New York Strip $35 *ordered medium rare, came out almost blue, sent back, they recooked the same piece of meat (found this a little odd) it was just ok, a little pricey for a strip steak and nothing would compel me to order this again.  DESSERT: Flourless Chocolate Cake w/Pistachio Ice Cream *pretty rich and decadent, everything you want in a chocolate cake, loved it, great portion couldn't finish it  COCKTAILS: Your Money or Your Life: $11 Old Forester Bourbon, Benedictine, Combier, orange bitters.  Good old-fashioned with a big ice cube.  Aunt Charlie: $10 Aylesbury Duck vodka, earl grey tea, honey-lemon shrug, served up.  The server explained it was like an Arnold Palmer.  This was not like an Arnold Palmer, the drink actually made me wince when I drank it.  Personally not a fan and I would maybe ask for it on the rocks or substitute it w Tito's, I think the vodka tasted like rubbing alcohol."}
{"text":"Danielle O'Connell and I had a Client Appreciation party several weeks ago on the patio of Buck & Rider. The ambiance was perfect and the food delicious and tastefully arranged. In addition, the wait staff was very attentive and pleasant.  It was a pleasure to work with Lauren Wyckoff, the event coordinator, and our event couldn't have been more fun or in a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for our second time, as our family is all about seafood. My husband works for a large seafood company and nothing like great seafood! Service is exceptional, along with the food and atmosphere! Our son is in the navy so we decided to buy appetizers for a table that had a uniformed officer sitting there. He came over to thank us for our gesture. Turns out he deploys for Iraq Sunday! As he thanked us- my husband and I teared up and we told him it seems so trivial to buy for someone who would lay down their life for our country! Thanks Buck and Rider for treating him so well! God speed to him- and GOD BLESS AMERICA!!"}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect from an LGO restaurant. Did not dissapoint. Fresh and we'll executed."}
{"text":"I went here during Restaurant Week and had the Prix Fix Ribeye Steak for around $30.  It was a great value, even though the steak was only around 10 ounces and not quite as hot as it could have been.  Great flavor.  But the fried cauliflower was OFF THE HOOK."}
{"text":"I had an excellent surprise bday party at this place. It is busy and be prepared to wait but it is well worthed ! I had the shrimp pasta and we had oysters as appetizers. The service is amazing, warm atmosphere and friendly staff. It was a wonderful bday! I had complimentary double dessert."}
{"text":"Go for happy hour!! From open to 6 pm there are great drink specials and amazing deals on delicious food. I would drive from West Phoenix JUST for the Brussels sprouts! The ceviche is different from your typical Mexican dish in all good ways, all the seafood is fresh and prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Buck & Rider. Our reservation was early, 6:00, so other than the bar, the restaurant was not overly crowded. We were seated at a nice table ( inside/outside). We sat for a little while and then our waitress came and asked for our drink order. Then we sat for what seemed like an eternity before she finally showed up to take our food order( no apology either) We ordered an appetizer and our meals. Again another very long wait and then our diners came. No appetizers. I actually had to flag the waitress down to ask her what happened to our appetizers and she acted surprised and said \" oh, you didn't get them, I'll bring them out right away\". Well we were done with our diners long before the appetizers showed up. Once again no apology. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the fish that we all ordered was very good. Not sure if I will return.  Well, we did return and I felt an amended review was necessary. It was a completely different dining experience. The service was prompt and the server was very attentive. The food was delicious, my husband and I both ordered the Mahi mahi. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fuck n Right on!! That would be my name of this restaurant. Sorry for my language, I really only swear on my reviews. Buck & Rider is an amazing addition from LGO and the seafood go to in PHX!!   I would have to say this is by far my favorite restaurant decor in the LGO family. The inside has a cool feel to it, I guess it was conceptualized after a house in Australia. High ceilings and lighting that ranges from an old chandelier to trees with small white lights. Either way this is the perfect place for that intimate date night with your significant other!! Now the food will help you there too with your lady! Nik Niks will get you Nik Niks they say, well at least that's what I say!!  This was our second time here and what brought us back was those little Nik Niks! We decided to go for a few different starters. We went with the crab dip: rich crab dip with a little spice which I believe was jalapeno. This cheesy dip goes perfect with the gluten free (not sure why) crackers with watermelon radish. We also got the Thai King Crab Salad: Okay, I swear the dressing is the same as the LGO Thai Chicken Salad. The Crab Salad was unreal good. Really surprised it worked so well with the Mango. Now the Nik Niks: These little buttery beauties are like oysters. Not sure exactly what's in these, but if Pfizer ever got their hands on these they may have the viagra for woman. Now food has never gotten me hot and bothered, but that's alright, I just need my lady that way!!! Haha. Order the Nik Niks!  Buck and Rider has a great selection of wines and full bar to fit any of your boozing needs!! If you leave here and your lady isn't ready to go home with you I would suggest taking your girlfriend somewhere cheaper or finding a foodie girl!! Buck & Rider / Fuck n Right on"}
{"text":"Ambiance great, service great with a ton of servers.  My highlight was the crispy hash browns.  My wife loved her tuna burger.  I had sushi that was average at best.  If you want sushi go to a sushi restaurant. Cry mistake. The crispy calamari were really soggy.  It is definitely a happening place.  The menu was just not for me.  Come  here if you want a fresh oyster bar."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here  Wednesday night.  We wanted seafood and a friend recommended Buck & Rider.  Complimentary valet was a nice touch.  Cold shrimp was perfect and the sauce was exactly like my husbands likes it.  Brussel sprouts were the best we've had.  Crispy and roasted beautifully.  I had the whole lobster tail.  My husband had the filet and lobster.  The filet was outstanding.  Lobster was good but we both would have preferred it served de shelled (the traditional way) not split done the middle and in the shell.  Lobster was average.  The server was darling.  It was very loud and would opt to sit outside, weather permitting, than sit in such a noisy dining room.  Reminded me of the Southern Rail, as far as the noise level goes.  We will certainly do back."}
{"text":"I got together with friends this past weekend to celebrate one of my girlfriend's birthdays, it was her boyfriend who chose this restaurant [did a fab job picking it].  One of our friends noted he'd never seen this place before despite driving the Camelback corridor many times for work travel. It really is tucked away behind it's neighbor office building. It's definitely got the cute, semi-dressy vibes to enjoy a great meal for a date night. All of us arrived a little before our dinner reservation and were able to enjoy a few drinks at the oyster bar before being seated.   The hostess led us to a nice booth in a corner with ample space for all. Can't recall who our waitress was, but she quickly came to us with waters and a welcoming face. She did a superb job from beginning to end!  Our waitress went thru the menu and let us know her favorites and the daily specials. I went with the salmon dish which was simply amazing. Most of the items in the description I wasn't sure what they were [hah], but it was just a great dish, period. Even though it's not listed on the menu, you can order a side salad before the entree for $8. The house dressing was light but flavorful!"}
{"text":"Bring your earplugs and your patience. Dinner for 4 moved to the patio because noise inside was so bad you could not hear the person next to you. Seating on the patio was better, still noisy, but not as bad. Service was abysmally slow. Had to remind the server on two occasions of appetizers and bread. Long time between drinks and appetizers and main course. Other couple ordered sushi and said it looked old - not fresh. Specialty drinks were good. Dinner course average quality. Bring people you enjoy being with, as the food will not hold your attention."}
{"text":"We had a great anniversary dinner Friday night at Buck and Rider! The food was amazing. I cannot begin to tell you how awesome it is to get oysters in the middle of the desert. It really brings me back to my childhood growing up on the coast. Best happy hour in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this place. Best oysters in town, and the staff is knowledgeable about them. On our last visit, Kathryn, the bar manager, went completely above and beyond to accommodate our group. This just doesn't happen - most places just tell you too bad, there's a wait so get in line. The food, along with the customer service, will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Long time yelper, first time posting! Stopped by for national Oyster day! Food was great, Sam out waitress made our meal even better with her great service!   Oysters, and fried rice were great! Leaving full and happy :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how the food scene in Phoenix was, but I was impressed!  I was craving some oysters so relied on Yelp to point me in the right direction. It was slightly away from where I was staying, but luckily I had a rental car!   The restaurant is decently sized with a nice large bar. Since I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar to people watch.   I tried the sun hallow and blue point oysters. They were fresh, but you can tell the person shucking them wasn't a pro. I also tried the mussels, which are a must try if you like mussels!   Normally, I don't have a sweet tooth, but I had to finish with some vanilla ice cream! They are very generous with the scoops and I couldn't finish. They were also giving away cookies when I left, but I was wayyyy too full to even take one!"}
{"text":"Nice place, great service.  Food was very high quality with an emphasis on seafood.   Nice raw bar and cooked seafood items on the menu.  Also have nice steaks.  The host was very accommodating with my reservation change request which I also really appreciate.   Had a special dinner there with a colleague and it was a success."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO EAT BREAKFAST IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!!!!! Their hash browns are amazing. They are crispy and soft at the same time and they are served with a great sour cream. Their French toast is the best thing ever!!! If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be buck and riders French toast!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here spur of the moment to get out of the house Friday night.  We have a baby on the way and wanted some good QT before the big arrival.  Everything that night was perfect, from the warm greeting we received by the host.  We were seated at a very quaint table, and our waitress Olivia made our night so nice with her knowledge of the menu, making recommendations, engaging in warm conversation...the best service we have had in a very long time.  The food was so fresh and tasty.  The bartender even came over to discuss whiskey options with my boyfriend.  Outstanding service, food/drink presentation, and flavors were SO good that we decided to go back 2 days later for brunch!!!  Olivia was there working (we were not at our table) and she saw us and came over to say hi.  Needless to say...we will be back here more often!"}
{"text":"Came to Buck & Rider a few months back to celebrate our anniversary. I still remember the taste of jumbo shrimp and lobster on my mouth. Both entrees tasted fresh and savory, and though I had to admit I like to douse my lobster in butter, this time there was no need to. This seafood restaurant could have very well executed the nautical theme in a cheesy way, but instead they did it with aplomb and class. The drinks were delicious and I ordered the key lime pie after the bartenders told us, \"You have to order it!\" That graham crust was like little crumbs of heaven had just kissed my lips. You bet I ate every bite of it.  I would recommend this place as the perfect date night, just be warned that it can get expensive very quickly so try out happy hour if you're trying to save a buck or two."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and was really excited pulling up to a great bar and outside seating area.    Unfortunately the entire dining experience had a level of arrogance by the restaurant.  Wait staff made us feel like we were lucky to be there and they were bored.    Good fresh food - but I don't need to pay that kind of money and have that type of service...plenty of better options"}
{"text":"Overall good food and very good service. Don't go with the sushi but all other dishes were good. $6 Happy hour cocktails were well prepared."}
{"text":"My fiance chose this as a surprise dinner spot for my birthday after I'd hinted at wanting to go here a time or two ;)  Excellent fresh seafood, vibe & atmosphere, and attentive service. No wait on a Tuesday night which was nice.  We started off with the oysters from WA and BC,WOW! Super fresh.. my favorite was the Kusshi from BC. I could've eaten 2 dozen of those!  I ordered the whitefish daily special (some variety of mediterranean seabass) with brocollini. The fish came out in 2 separate filets, was lightly breaded and covered in a garlic butter sauce that was so good, I probably could've drank it. I tried a few bites of my fiance's Milano Pasta Troife, which was absolutely amazing .. succulent pieces of shrimp and sausage in pasta and a flavorful garlic sauce. I'd love to order that next time!  The waitress treated us to lemon meringue pie as a bday treat - to no surprise, this was amazing as well and we gobbled it up.   There's a few wood fires around the restaurants that make the place smell ungodly good. The low lighting makes for an intimate and romantic ambience - great date spot.  Can't wait to return. Thanks for a wonderful birthday dinner, Buck & Rider!"}
{"text":"Christian was a awesome bartender! Very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks. I totally recommend this joint. The happy hour is awesome"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I have nothing to complain about nor give advise on. The experience started at the door, making you feel like a celebrity. The service... Blew us away!!! So attentive and on point. The drinks were crafted beautifully and they weren't drowned by bitters nor aromas. The Raw Bar selection (super super fresh!!!) Fresh shucked oysters, whole main lobster (the butter is dangerously delicious), I even dipped my dinner roll in it!!!! and stone crab claws!!! Everything from the decor to the wait staff was perfect. Big kudos our server Talia, she really made our experience one of the best yet!!! Buck &Rider is the place to be at for seafood and a great time."}
{"text":"Buck &rider is one of my favorite restaurants of all time! I've been on dates, for a birthday party, a bridal shower brunch, and with family, and every time I leave very happy. That is because they have the best seafood options in the valley, as well as chicken, steak, and pork options for everyone in a group to be satisfied with. Lunch, brunch, or dinner, you can find me there munching on sushi, Brussels sprouts, swordfish, surf and turf, etc, like I said, they do it all! Love you Buck &rider!!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review for Buck & Rider. I was there 4/8/18 for dinner with a friend.  Our dinner was what I'd hoped this restaurant could be since they'd opened.   To start, we ordered the Miranda oysters. Briny and sweet, and very fresh tasting. Delicious! Our main course was the Faroe Island Salmon and scallops, both cooked to perfection. The salmon was moist and flaky, and the scallops were pan searing to perfection. Neither needed additional seasoning or the sauces provided because when you cook good food well, you don't need anything else. Fresh lemon and we both loved it.  The coleslaw is amazing. Desert was the lemon meringue pie. It's still one of the best deserts I've eaten.  So thank you, Buck & Rider for redeeming my faith in you. I've wanted you to be what you now are."}
{"text":"Buck & Rider is located right off Camelback in same lot that Havana Cafe used to be. The restaurant has inside and outside seating with a huge fire place on the patio. The restaurant was clean with a dark wood decor. This visit we sat in the bar area at the high top tables.   This visit was in connection to National Oyster Day - Buck & Rider provided half off all Oysters in the shell. For this event I order one of every Oyster listed - each were delicious with its own taste, size and texture. During a normal day the server would have described each in more detail but as the visit progressed the restaurant became very busy. The grilled Brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious it was served with this baked cheese spread that was too die for.   The service started out amazing - but with the craziness of the National holiday day it was hard to get our check to leave.  But our server was sweet and was working as hard as she could."}
{"text":"Wow can't say enough about this place. I'm mad at myself it took so long to get here for the first time. We sat in their \"alcove\" which is open seating behind the bar - awesome atmosphere, perfect lighting and not too loud so you can still hear the people you are with. The food should be SIX STARS , highly recommend the Brussel sprouts and the calamari, and Thai sauce for the calamari is unlike anything I have ever tasted . The lemon meringue for desert was the perfect balance of fluffy, sweet, lemony, and not too heavy. To top it all off our server Katrina was very attentive, and very helpful when we had questions about the menu and restaurant.   Overall this place is . First time I've ever given a six star review."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Went here for the first time for date night and I was very impressed with my experience. The service was great and the food was very appetizing. My husband and I started with the caesar salad and the warm bread rolls both which were tasteful. My husband really enjoyed those bread rolls! For our entree we had the Pan Crisp French Loup de Mer which was superb. Our main entree did come out with a side of veggies that had pork mixed in which we couldn't eat, and Angelinea our waitress took it away immediately and replaced with with a new side right away! I would highly recommend asking for Angelinea as your waitress, she was very sweet and attentive. Overall we had a great experiance!"}
{"text":"Food was overall really good. We started with the sushi for appetizers. Food came very fast once ordered, which isn't always a good thing. And they brought out our sides a good 5 minutes before main meal, which I didn't like. The Brussel sprouts were delicious tho. The bread was nothing special and I'm surprised they charge for it. It too came out way before the meal so it was cold by the time the food came. My father in law also ordered come oysters (I didn't try then) but he said they were wonderful. The fish was great, and scallops were also good but a bit salty. And they only came with three. The New York  and fillet were very good.  The sides each dish came with were unique and tasty. The chief  clearly had unique ideas, and I appreciated that- just needs a bit more fine tuning.  Main dishes were all good and price was reasonable. My mixed drink was not that great. And the biggest complaint I had was the waitress was a little rude. I'd definitely go back tho because the Food made up for the service. The restaurant is cute, nice ambience and clean."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and enjoyed each time. Service is top notch.   Experience one: came here with a girlfriend and decided to split a few dishes.  We started with the calamari, which is now one of my favorites. It doesn't have the traditional marinara dipping sauce but instead a tangy vinaigrette which I. My opinion is so much better. Then we got the mussels!! These are sooo good the flavor is amazing - also come with a tasty piece of corn bread! Lastly, we had the real California roll with kale salad! This this was huge but so good with the real crab! Kale salad was perfect!   Second experience: came here with my boyfriend for my birthday.  We came in Sunday and Sunday's they have 1/2 bottles of wine!! Yes please! For food started with the he amazing calamari again then the clams ( they changed the mussels out) theses weren't my favorite- flavor was blah and the clams wee very small.  The bread was also burnt black. That's the best part is the bread and sauce. ( I did ask for new bread and they forgot and ended up giving us a gift card because they felt so bad on my birthday- so unexpected but so awesome). My boyfriend got the chicken which everyone knows you don't order chicken at a restaurant because that's lame - and he regretted it. Super generic much better options on the menu. Lastly we had the lemon pie - oh my fluffy lemony yum!!! We crushed this.  All in all awesome experience both times will definitely be back!  Oh and don't forget on your way out to grab the little sea salt chocolate cookies that they have from LGO! Those things are gold!"}
{"text":"If you love seafood, definitely check this place out. They really do have the best happy hour out there! For less than $100 we got a full lobster, oysters, 12 HUGE shrimps, Dixie chicken, and steak tartare. Service was great and can't wait to be back. Just a tip though. You have to sit in the bar to get happy hour pricing. :)"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous birthday dinner here last night!  On the patio by the fire, a fantastic server, a few delicious cocktails- and delicious food.  I know this is a seafood place but the Brussels sprouts are amazing.  I am literally craving them today.  The table then shared several apps, all tasty.  I then got the crab wedge salad for dinner and was very happy with nice lump crab, good flavors and veggies.  And then dessert.  Flourless chocolate cake.  Yum. We left stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"Last night was my third visit here. NEVER disappoints. I'm a Brooklyn girl so I grew up with Fulton Fish Market and incredible seafood a few train stops from home. I've been on the hunt for a go-to place when the seafood craving hits and Buck & Rider is it! Love all the variations on ceviche, the awesomely creative sushi and the mussel broth (oh my ... that is GOOD broth!). Service is fantastic: speedy, friendly and welcoming. The drinks are perfect complements to the fish. Already planning a return trip next week when friends are in town!"}
{"text":"As I have commented previously, this is my favorite seafood restaurant in Phoenix. The restaurant itself was constructed from the ground up, not a redo of a previously failed restaurant.  Decor and furnishings are fresh and attractive; silverware substantial, with cloth napkins.  The bar stools - upholstered wrought iron -require a body builder to pick up and move.    When you enter the restaurant, the minerally, briny aroma of fresh seafood lets you know you are coming into a sea food restaurant.  The first time I came here, my companion commented; \"reminds you of San Francisco and Maine, doesn't it?\" She was correct.    The restaurant has a food and beverage \"happy hour\" from 11-7 on Monday through Saturday featuring a variety of fresh oysters, giant shrimp (my favorite oxymoron), crab, and lobster, as well as a short list of cooked/prepared foods  all at half the menu price.  Additionally, a bubbly, a red, and a white are featured at $6 each; along with a variety of signature cocktails.   I've now had occasion to visit this restaurant more than a dozen times in the past 90 days.  The bar area is  jam packed from 4-7 most afternoons; with all bar stools and tables occupied, and a waiting line hovering.  The restaurant tends to fill up by 6:30 PM.   Extensive lunch and dinner menus, and wine lists are available - expect $50 per person (before gratuity) for dinner at a minimum.  I have yet to to escape lunch or cocktail hour for less than $50 per person (before gratuity) - but in fairness that includes a couple of glasses of the featured bubbly.  Take a look at Buck & Rider's Reserve Wine List if a special treat fits your budget.  With about 30 wines generally available, the Reserve List features wines that are often no longer available in the retail market.  An example - the 2011 Joseph Phelps \"Insignia\", a cab dominant red blend that sold for approximately $180 when it was released.  Difficult to find today; on-line resellers list it but most often it is a bait and switch and they try to talk you into a different wine or a different vintage.  The only retailer I found carrying this exact wine locally had four bottles and a price point of $290.  So B&R's $380 wine list price is not out of line.  I found two excellent White Burgundies on this list: a 2013 Puligny-Montrachet ($175); and a 2012 Puligny-Montrachet ($250);  With 4-6 oyster choices daily, I personally recommend  a mixed dozen ($18 happy hour), a shrimp or six ($9 happy hour), a flute or two of Cava ($6 each happy hour); steak tartare ($9 happy hour) with a glass of cab; and a stem of brut rose for dessert (check $75 before gratuity) - Uber - and a nap.  Service can be a bit brusque when extremely busy, but I generally find it to be anticipatory and superb with staff trained to make food and wine pairing recommendations from the well curated wine list - both by the glass and bottle.  The General Manager - Laura - comes across as a consummate professional; welcoming and congenial, but clearly missing nothing that goes on in her restaurant.  If one is dining alone, and so inclined, But & Rider seems to attract a clientele that is representative of the Biltmore/Arcadia neighborhood wherein it is located - intelligent and attractive.  [The toughest job in this restaurant is the \"oyster shucker\".  Send a $5/10 bill in his/her direction.]   En joy."}
{"text":"Went there other night with my family and ordered a half pound of the Alaska king crab legs and they were amazing. The tops of the legs were cut off so I had easy access to the meat, and the legs were more filled with meat than any other order of crab I've had before."}
{"text":"It was a 5 star rating from the phone call I made letting them know my mother in law was visiting from out of town and wanted to try their happy hour menu for the oysters. The raw bar happy hour is only served in the bar area so it fills up quickly. Jonathan reserved a table for us until we got there within 15 minutes. He did not realize how much it meant to us for him to accommodate our request. This dinner was a special one since this would be the first time she has visited AZ without our dad. He passed a few months ago and he loved oysters so this was a tribute dinner to him. Miss and love you! Our waitress Cassandra, was very attentive, patient, and accommodating. She explained every dish we had a question about, which was 100. We ordered the blue point oysters, seafood gumbo, trout, Brussels sprouts, king crab legs, crab dip, jumbo shrimp, and lobster. Everything we ordered was amazing, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is truly the backbone of this restaurant.  I must start off by saying this because it's 100 percent true.  They make you feel warm and welcome and it amplified my experiences here.  I started with a simple margarita that turned out to be so good I had 3 more (lol).  After I had the real crab California Roll and the King Crab on a half shell. The sushi's texture was a little dense for my pallet but all the same delicious. On the other hand the King Crab was..... Fantastic! Sweet and decident just as fresh crab should be. I also decided to grab a few Jumbo Shrimp and was pleasantly surprised at the size.  All in all I highly recommend eating here. The fresh seafood along side awesome service and drinks make for a truly wonderful experience."}
{"text":"As expected this place provided exemplary Service from the valet parking, seating hostess, and waitstaff.  We ordered the appetizer of Brussel sprouts. They were good very over-the-top! Worth ordering.  At her table we had a variety of meals including a burger or fish catch of the day, sushi, and a steak. All at our table we're delighted with the taste and appreciated the good meal.  The atmosphere is very fine and fun with a central bar and very engaging staff. This place is trendy and very pricey.... But it's what you should expect from the central quarter camelback crowd."}
{"text":"Wow! The Bronzino fish was spectacular as was the lemon pie! The drinks were interesting and different. There was a high level of background noise. This was a relaxing, wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Wonderful new restaurant ! As a seafood lover and non meat eater . This place is a gem ! Oyster selection and fresh seafood choices priced reasonably make this establishment quite the find! Wine prices are also very reasonable ! Service is excellent and attentive !! Wish it was closer to home but then I'd have to send them my paycheck ! I'll be back !!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for happy hour here and it is FANTASTIC!  We shared oysters, shrimp cocktail (they were gigantic) and a salmon roll and I had a cocktail that came with the cutest little plastic camel on the side. I think it must be owned by the LGO or Chelsea's Kitchen because they had the yummy salted chocolate chip cookies by the door. They were also kind enough to let us sit at a table instead of the bar and have happy hour there because we had the kids with us. I love it when a restaurant can be a little flexible. This is a great place and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places. We've heard about their great happy hours but went to celebrate my parents anniversary and were restricted to the normal dinner menu/pricing. All I can say was everything we ordered was delightful. We went all out with 18 oysters, two apps, 4 mains, and two desserts. . . hey, we were celebrating. It was a great excuse to try as much of the menu as we could and we were not disappointed. Some of the highlights, the Brussels sprout app and the oysters of course. The coleslaw was the surprise hit of the light for me and easily took the top spot for best coleslaw I've ever had. The desserts also lived up to the evening, and the lemon meringue was everyone favorite. We might not be able to replicate our celebration very often but we'll definitely be back to check out the happy hour scene. Can't imagine it won't be as wonderful as our first visit."}
{"text":"About two months ago, I went to Buck & Rider and decided to never go back again after having the ahi burger. Fast forward to tonight, and I somehow found myself back here. Except this time, my order was amazing. I got the Caesar salad and the lobster roll (pictured). Sat at the bar, and all the bartenders are awesome. I was a little hesitant at first of the lobster roll, but I'm glad I listened to everyone - even the spicy mayo on it was delicious. Yes, this is an LGO concept and ultimately they're all similar in ways (cough interior decorating), but it's worth a visit. Looking forward to checking out their happy hours and brunch in the future."}
{"text":"I'm in town from Michigan...haven't found a restaurant like this one there.  I absolutely love the ambiance.  The food was really flavorful and truly delicious!  We had Mia as our fantastic waitress. She was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale this week and had a craving for seafood.  Here is my breakdown:  Atmosphere:  Casually rustic with warm dim lighting.  Wait staff:  Started out very slow, took about 12-15 minutes before waitress showed up at the table.    Food: Oysters: Fresh & delicious  Calamari: Not recommended, very thin rings of calamari with an over powering and tasteless batter  Cocktails:  very good!    Shrimp pasta:  overall pretty good, slightly salty  Overall, my experience was a good one and I am confident there are some other really good things on their menu."}
{"text":"The filet was rich with flavor and smelled delishous from the moment it was placed on the table. The wood fired flavor was surprisingly good, and the asparagus was grilled to perfection with a small portion of melted cheese, a perfect amount. LGO wine blend is smooth with a perfect medium body (I do not profess to know wine except what tastes good to me, not too dry, not too sweet).  And, lastly, the lemon meringue pie tasted incredible! The flavors came through from the meringue to the lemon to the heavenly buttery, brown sugar infused crust. The staff were down to earth and accommodating. A delishous experience!"}
{"text":"Seafood platter, the oysters, the bottle of wine and the surf and turf was simply amazing. The ambience was pretty cool with an upscale fisherman's wharf type of feel with excellent service. We had a local girl from Hawaii who made us feel as tho we were in the islands from the moment we arrived to the time we sat down till closed due to great company, food, service and just lost track of time."}
{"text":"Stopped by B&R on a Saturday to treat myself after a hard (ok not so hard) day of over time.  I love that they offer all day happy hour in the bar and took advantage of their specials.  I was super bummed to find out their pull apart dinner rolls are not available during lunch/brunch but thankfully the kitchen was kind enough to accommodate my request.    As on prior visits, the bar service came up lacking. The gentleman who was the main bartender had amazing skills in drink making but not so much on service and personability . My seafood tray sat empty in front of me for 25+ min before his trainee was thoughtful enough to remove it.  I was asked if I wanted a second glass of wine but never received it as he spent the rest of his time doting his regulars and telling them about his Halloween plans. I am glad someone got good service."}
{"text":"Great new spot on the heart of Phoenix. Wait staff was attentive and the food was amazing. Open kitchen concept which I love, scratch made food and the vibe was even better. I will most definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Tried this place and had good experience, variety of fish, meat, salads, sea food, nice atmosphere, delicious fresh food, definitely be back"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite HH spot.  Could eat here everyday!  Great staff - drinks are tasty.  Love the vibe!"}
{"text":"RIDE ON CAMELBACK!   I'll make this one short n sweet - get the seafood!   Or the steak!   I did enjoy a delicious medium-rare filet here (all butchered in house, btw) however the photo evidence has gone by the wayside from some time back and I swore that I'd revisit it (get another steak!) prior to the review however that seafood..oh that seafood is hard to resist and so I have not.   The selection of oysters is very good - around six from which to choose (seafood flown in daily) and I appreciate how they'll even let you order one of each if you'd like. Especially on happy hour - half off - such a deal. Few places will let you order even just one oyster (I know, who would do this?!) but sometimes, I'd like only three or four and that's ok here.   The steak tartare is excellent and also an adequate portion size - points for that! The calamari was good, a bit greasy for our liking. They have a whole or half lobster offered for $24/$12 respectively (happy hour price, I believe) - again, so nice for getting a taste.  They have a daily selection too of fresh fish in entree portions.   I'm a Grey Goose consumer (or craft, small batch) and they don't offer it - Belvedere is their top shelf - tried the house vodka and didn't care for it, but worse, the bleu cheese olives were mush. (I need structural integrity in the olive.) The server was excellent and offered another cocktail but I saw it through! (Just no further olive testing.) Next time, its Belvedere or bust.   With the large, open bar and high tops offering a lengthy happy hour, and a restaurant section that's not cramped, plus a generous-sized patio out front - surely you'll find a comfy spot here. Oh!! And fabulous kudos to the architects --- I was jonesin' to hit a rooftop -I'd said yesterday morning, \"I'd like a view\".... I knew there was none from the bar area but wait! Just go to the restroom. That was the first place I visited yesterday and I appreciated the gorgeous vista of Camelback.   Great job, Buck and Rider.   (PS- I didn't know - \"Buck and Rider\" is their oyster cove in Washington and hence, the name. They offer these oysters daily.)"}
{"text":"They really take the quality of their food very seriously here. Food that is served raw and fresh. My girlfriend and I ordered a variety of things. The fresh oysters, raw sushi and the steak tartare with a egg yolk on top. Finally, the dessert was the four layered chocolate cake with a creamy scoop of ice cream. The food here was very satisfying and enjoyable to eat. The atmosphere makes you feel like that you are not exactly in the city. Got the warm feeling to it, while making it look really nice inside."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months now and it continues to get better and better. The service is spot on, atmosphere exceptional and you can't beat the happy hour and Sunday Funday specials - 1/2 off bottles of wine and sushi.  Thanks Whitney for the great service."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 5 on saturday. Heard great reviews and the fam LOVES seafood so we took a dip in the new restaurant pond.   It was someone's bday and i was the first to arrive. I asked if they had a candle or something we could blow out for a dessert...the response \"um no we dont. We keep getting asked if we do\" and a long pause. Um ok?   It was slow due to a holiday so the waitress was on our ass alllll night and not giving us a lot of time to chat at the table. She was super nice but hit the brake a bit hunny.   Now the food! The pull apart bread was AMAZING. So good that we got another order of it.  Friends got blue point oysters and said they were amazing! Calamari was on point as well! Im a steak guy so i ordered the NY steak. Very good and flavorful. It does come out cut which im not used to but it was fine. Very prime piece of meat - hardly any fat.  We got the chocolate cake for dessert. Very good but its extremely thick and not very moist (its really good though!)  Overall, the place is great. Looks good inside and the food was fantastic.  Wish they did reservations - it will come to bite them in the ass"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant turned out to be be most disappointment! We had to wait 30mins after scheduled reservation time! Not the best start to a Friday night for someone on crutches. Door staff was indifferent and least helpful. Disappointed.  Updated rating. Good save by the manager. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Had the best brunch and service from Gabby today. Crab Benedict was amazing, Bottomless mimosas, great atmosphere. We had a large party and gabby was extremely patient and prompt. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Such an unfortunate dining experience at this establishment.  We had a yen for sushi and seafood and decided to kill two crabs with one stone and dine at B&R.  We chose a seat at a table in the bar so we could indulge in a Happy Hour beverage while we ate lunch.  There were only a few patrons in the bar-it was wide open.  We sat there for 10 minutes-with 3 servers walking by, making eye contact, but never confirming that someone would be with us soon.  Finally a server met my eye and came over to take our drink order.  After another wait of 10 minutes we received our drinks.  Hoping to take the edge off of our hunger we quickly placed an order for a Spicy Avocado Roll and a Whole Steamed Lobster.  We also ordered a pan of Yeast Rolls-but she indicated they were out of rolls-at 12:30- hmmm.  Our Spicy Avocado roll was beautiful, unique and delicious.  Our Steamed Lobster was very small and overcooked.  Our server never checked back to inquire about our food-so we ate the chewy Lobster and vowed to order lunch to take the \"bad taste\" out of our mouth and hope for a better experience.  Unfortunately, our server made another disappearing act-and as the clock ticked-we lost our appetite and became ticked.  When our server finally did a drive by and inquired about our Lobster, I informed her it was chewy and overcooked.  She flatly said, \"I'm sorry\". No, WE are sorry to have had such a dismal experience lacking in hospitality at a restaurant group known for Customer Service."}
{"text":"Best place for fresh seafood in town!! My husband and I decided to try this place last night and it was amazing!!! We started off with the Harissa shrimp and chorizo skewers. My god.. Talk about fresh jumbo shrimp marinated and grilled to perfection. We loved the shrimp and chorizo skewers. They melt in your mouth. Then we tried the lobster tobanjan roll. There was so much lobster in this roll my tastebuds were in absolute heaven. And my husband who isn't a big fan of seafood due to the fishy taste and smell loved everything so far. There was absolutely no fishy aftertaste because I was told they get fresh seafood delivered every day. I ordered the fresh blue crab cakes as my entree and my husband got the Radio Milano pasta troife which is a shrimp pasta. Both entrees were absolutely delicious!!! The crab cakes were light and crispy with huge portions of fresh crab. I honestly think these were the best crab cakes I have ever ate in Phoenix. Again, no fishy smell or aftertaste which clarifies at how fresh the seafood at this place truly is. I had a bite of my husband's pasta with lots of shrimp in it. It was to die for!!! Everything we had was fabulous and I highly recommend this place!!! And towards the end of our dinner, the manager, Andre, came by to see how everything was and we told him we were definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience!  The ambiance is fantastic and perfect for the Arcadia area. The service was excellent and the staff was very knowledgeable. We had the lobster nik nik's, the lobster roll, oysters, and salmon. Everything was delicious and prepared perfectly. The wine list is also outstanding. I can't wait to go back, I would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was impeccable! Drinks were good. We got there right before happy hour ended and I got  an ace in the hole tequila cocktail. The baha shrimp cocktail was a great app. Oysters were amazing! I got the lobster surf and turf.  I've never had a more tender steak!my husband ordered the swordfish. He was slightly disappointed in it's small size, but flavor was great."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Had oysters, deviled crab dip, seafood cocktail, calamari, rolls and the nik niks.  Everything was delicious. The nik nik's were $18- definitely not worth the price. The mixed drinks we tried were all freshly prepared and tasted great! Great selection of beers. Heads up i believe its valet only- bring some cash. We went on a very busy sat nite but service was excellent. Great atmosphere and music. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to this Steak/Seafood restaurant 2 times in one week while visiting end of January 2018. I am taking the time to review because I want others to know that both times we went the atmosphere, service & quality of each item of food were beyond phenomenal. The hot rolls appetizers melted in your mouth, the chicken was the tastiest/juiciest Ive ever had, cole slaw the best, we ordered the surf & turf twice, and will not ever forget their signature dessert the Lemon Merengue pie which was huge and will turn you into a raving fan even if you don't like lemon meringue. The valet parking in front also added a classy touch for a classy place. Anytime we visit Phoenix we will not pass up another experience here. Must Try it!!"}
{"text":"It was an amazing ambiance and the service couldn't have been better. I'm super impressed and not to mention the food!!! Phenomenal. Way to Go Buck and Rider!"}
{"text":"Small menu, location and atmosphere was nice. Didnt really find too much that was special food and cocktails were good but would not call it amazing. We had calamari, Brussels sprouts, and breaded chicken for apps. I had a pasta dish with shrimp. There was a nice patio  just was too hot that day to sit outside. Not to loud for small group meet up conversation can be carried easily."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. I've come for happy hours, dinners and lunches and it never disappoints. I always refer people to check this place out when asked about places to eat in the area.  Their oyster selection is mostly from Washington state and always fresh and delicious. All of their fish plates I've had were awesome and healthy and their drinks are on point and stellar. I always look forward to coming to this place and extra points for the ambiance and patio seating!"}
{"text":"Review is for brunch/bar menu only. Great drink specials and morning happy hour. Oysters were very fresh, staff knows the menu and is very helpful if you need recommendations. Inside can be a little loud at peak hours like any restaurant, if you need something quieter they have a great outdoor patio"}
{"text":"We came on a Monday during happy hr.  We decided to sit at a table outside.  It was great ambience.    I like oysters so we got one of the seafood combo plates.  It was good but a little pricey.  I would go back and try the happy hr menu.    Most of the restaurant was empty but the bar area was packed.   I also got one of the House special cocktails with whiskey, I don't remember the fancy name but it was good!"}
{"text":"One of the best surf & turfs in town! We started with Oysters, brussel sprouts, and calamari for appetizers - all exceptional. I had the Rib Eye for dinner, cooked to perfection at medium rare, along with the half lobster.  It's hard to get great seafood in Phoenix, but this place nails it. Along with the amazing food, the service is great and the cocktails are adequately strong."}
{"text":"Would have given this review 5 stars if based on food alone. The food was excellent. The crispy Brussels sprouts were amazing. We also had the the French sea bass, salmon, and haddock. All delicious. But the service was terrible. We waited about 20 minutes for a server and complained to the manager before someone took a drink and appetizer order. And then we had multiple waitstaff helping us-they called it team service but I called it confusing, inefficient and frustrating. I couldn't even get anyone to take my payment and had to approach the manager to get it taken care of. So great food but lousy service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the cornbread is amazing! Very good seafood, especially if you like oysters, they are fresh daily.   To start my fiancé and I shared the tuna tostadas, these are a very refreshing and not too heavy. For my entree I had the Snapper Veracruz , no complaints. Great tasting and a generous portion.   My fiancé had the fresh blue crab cakes and a chickpea salad. Best crab cakes we've ever had, by far.    This place is worth checking out. We'll be back next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cool little Seafood eatery in the Camelback corridor. Fresh seafood in the desert. Overall had a pleasant experience. Have a great happy hour M-F 4 to 7 with half price at the oyster bar including some hot plates as well. We'll definitely be back to try other tasty treats. Nice bar n restaurant decor. Friendly helpful outgoing staff and service with a smile."}
{"text":"This place has the best seafood and great customer service, the staff is very well trained and very accommodating. We arrived early to meet several friends and started at the raw bar while we waited. While there we ordered 2 different bottles of wine, both I hate to say, were not to my liking. This was no problem for our server, Tersa, she couldn't have been nicer about it and was willing to get us whatever we wanted. We ordered Kusshi oysters which were small and sweet; very good and I really enjoyed the sauces that they served with them. We also tried the Brussel sprouts which were probably the best I've ever had especially with the goat cheese dipping sauce; fantastic! Once seated everyone in our group had fish and everyone was very happy with their entrees. I had the Loup de mer which was lightly breaded flaky white fish, others in the group had the crab cakes which were loaded with large chunks of crab. My husband  ordered the a medium-rare filet mignon. He sent the first one back because it was over-cooked to medium-well. The second one came out and it medium but thought he would eat it anyway and found it to be tough and tasteless. Again our server could not have been kinder and actually had the manager come to our table and offered my husband anything he wanted but since everyone was just about done eating he decline and they were nice enough to automatically take his dinner off the bill. Two must haves: the pull apart dinner rolls, served in a cast iron skillet; hot and soft with the right amount of saltiness and the lemon meringue pie which is creamy, not too tart with thick meringue and a graham cracker crust and huge enough to feed 3 people after a large dinner. The worst part of being in this restaurant is the noise level, it is so loud the servers can't even hear your order and it is difficult to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.  Salted dinner rolls Ahi burger Ceviche Scallops  Lobster Nik Nik And most importantly, the best part, our server, Mia was awesome. Amazing service."}
{"text":"This was my second time to the restaurant and it again for filled all my expectations. The broccoli appetizer was a specially delightful and flavorful the honey really made it a winner.  the service was very good and I would definitely recommend it and will go back again and again"}
{"text":"Again really just Chelsea's 2.0 w/a patio this time that faces one of the worst intersections in town! Obnoxious prices, same snotty waitstaff/arrogant mgmt & not so happy hr. LGNo Ps really well thought out name?!? Isn't that what you do when you get home..."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Buck & Rider!  The restaurant itself is trendy and beautifully decorated with great ambiance. They play FAB music too.The perfect spot for a date night!  The house made bread with sea salt is truly the best bread I have ever tasted. EVER. I would bathe in this bread's yeast, it's so good. Totally worth every carbohydrate it contains!  My date had sushi and seafood gumbo and raved about the taste of both. He was a very happy man!  I tried the \"Today's white fish\" entree, which happened to be sea bass with broccolini. The fish had a nice, crispy, yet flaky outside and was tender and deliciously seasoned. The broccolini was ahhhhmazing too.  You better believe we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Dined at B&R three times. Atmosphere inside and out is spectacular, along with Steak 44, one of the best looking restaurants in the area. The fresh seafood and raw bar has never disappointed. Friends who ordered entrees(steak and fish) have been very pleased. Well trained staff and the manager at the front all over the room. My go to favorite."}
{"text":"What a fun night! Didn't start out that way...the hostess was a MAJOR buzzkill. Maybe her broomstick was broken. Anyway...she shoved us in a table in the corner of the bar. There was barely enough room for our adorable server to slide between tables. Seriously. But, that being said, I soon got over the fact that I could see the whites of the total stranger's eyes right next to my head because of the awesome service, drinks, and food. This place hit it out of the park! Because we were so crammed in to the busy bar, we decided to just do a bunch of appetizers and drinks. We had the salt and pepper calamari with a thai sauce, which had a nice mix of both tentacles and rings. The crispy brussels sprouts were interesting with the goat cheese dipping sauce, but a little heavy on the gastrique. Still a hit. We enjoyed three VERY fresh sushi rolls with great unique sauces, and then some pretty tasty oysters...especially for Phoenix, not exactly the smartest choice in the desert! Oh, and the PEI mussels. I am PICKY about my mussels, and these were perfect. To drink, I had the \"One Night in Babylon\"...twice...STILL want other night! This had upscale gin, cucumber, lime, za'atar...yes...Indian spice. Sooo fresh and unique. Our server talked me into it, I was skeptical. She won. Also had a drink with tequila, coconut water, green tea, ginger. It was also unique and refreshing, but not as tasty as the other. I was very happy I was not the designated driver this night! Then, we finished with the BEST lemon meringue pie I have EVER had. I hate meringue, but this was perfect with a very tangy, yet sweet enough lemon filling and a crust my dear grandmother would have been jealous of! DEFINITELY going back again to have a full on dinner, with a reservation...on this particular hostess' night off! Valet parking was very prompt and courteous. Great experience. Will enjoy taking out of town friends here as well."}
{"text":"Go for happy hour and make sure Cassie is there. She's a sweetheart. Make sure you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I just hosted a client appreciation party at Buck & Rider last night for 60 of my clients. Everything exceeded my expectations! The event literally could not have gone better. The delicious food, attentive and smiling staff, and fantastic atmosphere all created the perfect evening where I could say thank you to my clients. I highly recommend Buck & Rider for a special event. The event coordinator, Lauren Wyckoff, is a delight. She's sharp, communicative, and friendly. I am already booking my next party for 2019. It was that good!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service - highly recommend their mussels, shrimp and crab legs!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and each time it has seemed to get better and better. Saturday night and the place is jumping! Had made a reservation and last minute added a couple more to the party.  Shout out to Lauren, the hostess, who was more than accommodating and my our wait enjoyable! You could tell she was a true professional and understands restaurant customer service!  Going on national oyster day, who knew there was such a thing, was a lot of fun. Although I didn't partake in the oysters everyone else said they were delicious! I'm more of an ahi tuna burger hold the bun, but bring the fries, kind of guy! The tuna was done perfectly and the fries are fantastic! Anything seafood there is excellent including the salads. We started off with a couple of appetizers highly recommend the brussel sprouts those were amazing.  Note the bartenders crushed it! The drinks where very creative and extremely tasty. Not to mention the oversized ice cubes make you feel like a young kid in a candy shop!   A well deserved 5  review!"}
{"text":"Finally found my favorite fresh seafood spot in the valley! Wow. What a hidden gem. So glad I found out about this place from a friend after seeing her amazing looking food pics on Snapchat!   My husband and I came for lunch on a Saturday and it turned out it was \"National Oyster Day!\" Luckily there was no wait and we were greeted right away. Our service was wonderful throughout the dining experience and everyone we encountered was super friendly and efficient. Ambience was really upbeat, laid back, and an open bar feel. We noticed they were setting up outdoor seating with another bar area, which I'm sure gets pretty busy and looks great in the evening.   Now to the food - it was superb! We tried the salt and pepper calamari with the Thai dipping sauce -- omg so good - may have been the best I've ever had! The sauce with peppers gave it a nice kick and was so flavorful. Definitely getting that again! We also ordered a few sushi rolls which were incredibly fresh and loved the unique combinations offered. I believe one had macadamia nuts inside and another had almonds. Those flavors merged well with the fresh shrimp, crab and other delicious  fillings. Feeling daring, my husband tried the raw oysters and surprisingly really liked them. The cocktail sauce, horseradish and other tangy sauce they were served with really enhanced the oyster flavor. Since we were filling up, we decided to split the crab cake blt and it was also excellent.   Next time I'm saving room for dessert. The couple next to us ordered some sort of merengue pie and it was HUGE. Being the nosy girl I am, I had to lean over and ask how it was -- they said it was to die for! I overheard the manager telling them the flourless chocolate cake is also her favorite and is served with an amazing flavorful gelato.   Yum yum yum. Can't wait to return and show this place off to our friends visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous find!! The atmosphere was terrific and very comfortable to have a drink & appetizers. The happy hour is awesome. Great seafood menu and amazing drinks! Highly recommend this place. Will be back!! Shelly"}
{"text":"The service was great and stone crab delish. I was slightly disappointed in the menu and of course it was very expensive. But I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Always happy when I go to buck n rider! Happy hour is on point! Brussels sprouts were so good, I ordered a second round. Also their ice cubes for the whiskey cocktail is awesome. Clear and square. That's not easy to do! Cheers guys!"}
{"text":"Buck and Rider.  Initially was not aware of the affiliation with La Grande Orange.  Loud, Loud and Loud. Can barely hear the person next to you. Dark inside where depending where you are sitting, it is difficult to read the menu.  Came here for family birthdays and started with the Salt and Pepper Crispy Calamari which came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a Thai Dipping sauce and the other was almost like a chipotle sauce. Calamari was nice and firm with excellent batter.  Ribeye with baked potato fully loaded. Buck and Rider serves LGO Reserve Black Angus Beef, grainfed and aged 25 to 35  days. Ribeye was very tender and prepared medium rare as requested. Beef was a good size cut at 14 oz for $37.  Service was excellent and the parking is mainly valet"}
{"text":"Our first time here the food was delicious the service was more than great Gabby was our waitress she is fantastic and desserts are to die for. Will return"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get the allure of Buck and Rider or Chelsea's kitchen. Good building ambiance and that's it. I don't think their food is very good. I love Le Grande orange so that is the exception. I think their food is trying too hard to be artsy when they should focus on just being good. There are weird combinations of food like shortbread crackers with crab dip. They crumbled when you tried to dip them and tasted chalky. Every time I have ordered at either place I struggle to find anything I  want on the menu AND I normally like their type of food. Most recently, we were there last Friday for a birthday. The food is over priced, service was not very good and I didn't like the way they cooked my order. I got the crab cakes and hubby ordered the chicken. Crab cakes were dry and over cooked on the bottom and there was minimal sauce. The salad was awkward with not enough dressing and huge leaves. My husband said his chicken was bland and really chewy. I think they cooked it on too low of a heat for a long time then heated it up too fast. The servers let us sit for extended time without taking our drink orders and it felt like we were bothering them when we asked for them to take menus from the table. We literally sat there for 30+ min at the end with no one asking if we needed another drink. I won't come back."}
{"text":"If you crave fresh seafood and other fine food, a casual, but elegant, un-stuffy atmosphere, this will be your destination.  This is a hideaway-feel place where you can order anything on the menu with confidence. The presentation is luxe, but in an honest way that speaks well for whatever is served.   The outdoor patio is right-sized and rich with greenery and charm.  Day dress is business casual.   Just the thought of trying everything on the menu here, over time, may also bring you joy once you experience it.   If I had to choose one place to eat in Metro Phoenix, this is it based on my experience thus far."}
{"text":"I was dragged here by my friends and I knew ahead of time that it wouldn't be great for me as a vegan.  I actually ate before I went there and it was a good thing I did.  I thought that I may get something small to eat with my friends, however it seemed as though any options for vegans would only be made my omitting animal products off of items and I really didn't feel like paying for a full price menu item with what seems like half of it taken off.  I got some drinks and hung out with friends and watched them eat.  They did like what they ate.  The atmosphere was nice and the waitstaff was nice, but is not a place for a vegan!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and ordered the bottomless mimosas and a bunch of appetizers and oysters. I'm not a huge oyster fan but gave these a try. They were average, nothing incredible. The staff was nice and attentive. My server let me swap out my beverage that I didn't like so that was very nice of her. We enjoyed the steak tartare, which was my very first time trying it. THat was delicious. The atmosphere is very open and cute. Casual but many people were dressed nicer. The bottomless mimosas are a good deal and some of the appetizers are delicious. I was not impressed by the oysters though"}
{"text":"I was really worried about moving back to Phoenix away from the ocean since I'm a seafood fanatic. However, I was happy to learn that Buck and Rider is right down the street from my house. Great location, and very convenient to get to.  I tried the raw oysters- holy delicious! Words cannot even describe how fresh they tasted! I then went with the ceviche which was so fresh. I honestly couldn't believe how fresh the fish tasted!   I went during happy hour and the deals were outstanding. I love the decor and vibe too! I'll definitely be back for dinner....and of course some more oysters! Yum!!!!"}
