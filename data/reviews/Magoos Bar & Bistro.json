{"text":"Atmosphere - walk into a bar with dark wood, small lounge area, half walls open to dining room about the same size as the bar/lounge. Maybe a dozen or so tables.

Service - 4/5 stars for mid-range American restaurant service. Several tables and several people at the bar, looked like pretty good business for a late Friday afternoon. Took maybe 5 minutes for someone to bring menus. Food took a while to come. Everything was as we ordered and anything extra we asked for came immediately. There is also a private area upstairs for large-ish parties that can have a private bar.

Food - overall everything was okay, okay prices. Nothing special, nothing bad. Quesadilla plain ordered for child was made with Italian-seasoning flavored tortilla. Reuben looked like a good, medium sized, corned beef sandwich, did not appear to be grilled, served with really creamy cole slaw, lots of meat. Cup of shrimp bisque was least well-liked, very creamy and tasting of flour served with house salad with fresh-looking mesclun mix and lots of black canned olives ($7xx for both). Steak salad ($11xx) with decent steak considering it was on a salad, lots of fries, pre-grated cheese, onion, bacon bits (maybe fresh), ranch dressing, couple tiny tomatoes, 4 cucumber slices. Small children's menu with 4-5 typical options and includes a drink in a lidded cup with straw.

Note on buffet - for $10 - Rice, steamed squash cubes, really dried-up pierogies, roast beef floating in sauce/gravy, really dried-up creamy pasta, salad, Italian bread. Possibly this looked good at the beginning of the service. We did arrive close to 1 so maybe the food wasn't being refreshed anymore and the food looked really bad. Even with a buy 1 get 1 coupon no one in our party wanted the buffet.

Bar - this may be the focus of the house with drink or beer specials every night. Happy hour - drinks $1 off and half-price appies from 5-7, may be worth a return trip.

This isn't my style of restaurant but it is good for what it is. I brought relatives who eat very conservatively and they enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"To celebrate my son's birthday last night, we went to one of my favorite places for dinner; Magoo's.  Many people like to go there for drinks, but one of the things I really enjoyed was their restaurant.  I used to tell people that I never had anything I did not like at Magoo's.  But alas, that has changed. 

A few months ago they let the bar manager go.  I was disappointed because I thought he brought a lot of class to the place.  He would greet customers personally, was knowledgeable about the beers and spirits that were available and ensured that service was prompt and pleasant.  He always offered good suggestions of new things to try and organized promotions that would make an evening out a little more interesting.  The beer tasting seminars they did a couple years ago first piqued my interest and got me going to Magoo's regularly.  The recent change in bar staff coupled changes in my routine lead me to go there less and less.  The bar felt less welcoming to me, but I chalked that up to my comfort with the old staff.

When I first ate at Magoo's, I found the food extremely good and soon found myself having dinner there regularly.  When my mother or friends from out of town would visit, I would feel confident taking them to Magoo's knowing I could expect good service and a delicious meal.  Over the last several weeks, I have noticed that the flavor of the food seemed less than what I was accustomed to.  Last week, I was severed a chicken strip appetizer that was inedible.  Then last night I ordered the special, Chicken Pot Pie.  

Chicken Pot Pie has been a staple on the menu at Magoo's since I first started going there and it has always been a hearty, tasty, well prepared dish.  Last night I was severed a dish whose contents were too hot to eat even after sitting for an extended period of time.  The crust was so rubbery I could not eat it with a fork, instead I had to cut it with my knife, but it was the only part of the dish I could put in my mouth without raising blisters on my tongue.  The dish was obviously overly prepared in a microwave not baked when I ordered it.  

The waitress noticed I was not eating my meal and was very concerned, insisting upon bringing me something else to eat. I opted for the Blackened Salmon dish my son had ordered.  It was better, but still not to the level I have come to expect; passable but unimpressive.  

I found out that the former head chef has moved from the area and that the owners are attempting to make the kitchen more profitable by changing some of the ingredients.  

It shows.  Too bad the quality and attention to detail has to suffer as well.  I will have to find a new 'regular' place to go.  The area has lost a gem in Magoo's Bar and Bistro."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the person who reviewed this first. They are so 100% right that it is hit or miss depending on what you order. I had a similar experience with the \"lobster roll\" HUGE roll, and a less than adequate amount of shredded lobster soaked in butter. Which is weird too, usually it would be more of a lobster salad, but not this time. All that and fries, I'm sure it was around $15.00 and not even worth it. But then, the time before that, I had something (I can't remember what) and it was great. 

The place is actually nice, and I wish they would get their act together, because this place really does have a ton of potential. I just wish they would rethink some of the items on their menu, and its execution."}
{"text":"Ok, I officially give up on this place.  Because I live closeby, I have been returning from time to time.  I thought I was just a glutton.  Turns out I am a glutton for punishment.
Dinner hour today, all of 3 tables had customers seated at them in the dining room.  Bar area was deserted as well.  But hey, new menu, wanted to check it out.
The first thing I discovered was that MaGoo's has cheaped out and stopped serving bread with dinner.  Really?  You're going to save a WHOLE DOLLAR on a $20 entree by eliminating the bread?  They will bring you bread if you ask for it, however.
My wife said her entree (Parmesan encrusted salmon) was excellent.
My crab cakes, however, were obviously burned and dried out.  I had to send them back.
This place is too hit and miss for me.  I'm done.  They need to hire a chef who can actually cook.
In the meanwhile, if you want some decent crabcakes, go to Fresco's in Wexford, where the service and food put Magoo's to shame."}
{"text":"Magoo's is gone!  Passed the building today and they just put up a new sign....now it is called \"Fiddlers.\"  Graphics on the sign make it appear to be a country/western bar.....looks like a square dancer on the sign.  If it isn't a country/western bar now, they got rooked on the sign!  Yikes.....I don't think I'll be checking out a country place!  I'll wait to hear the yelps on this one....."}
