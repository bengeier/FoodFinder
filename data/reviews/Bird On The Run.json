{"text":"Oh my god!!!!! Just ate here 5 minutes ago and I wish that I could time travel back to when I was still hungry bc this place makes the best goddang chicken sandwich in town.  5 out of 5 would recommend to a best friend"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but was quickly disappointed. The easiest way to explain this restaurant is an over-priced Chic-fil-A. Small portions of fast food with high costs. You could get the same exact meal (spicy chicken sandwich, 3-piece chicken strips, and 1 order of medium fries) for $9 at Chic-fil-A that cost over $17 here. Small portions - the 3-piece chicken strips were very small, maybe 1x3\" each (maximum). The food isn't bad, just isn't worth what you're paying. I did not get to try any of the alcoholic beverages, but they are also rather pricey. Very laid-back ambiance, again, just like a sit-down fast food restaurant. Would not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"A new delightful find...get the  \"l'l\" chicken sandwich ...served with a fried egg and savory green tomatoes...waffle fries were a nice add on...and the frozen Moscow mule is a must!!!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was good but I didn't think it lived up to all the hype. Very much a hipster favorite. I would put the food on par with Chik Fil A, but at several dollars higher. Again, it was good and fresh but not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Bird on the Run is a solid chicken shop and provides a nice dining setting with its chicken print wall paper and 1950s-1960s music. 

I ordered the hot chicken sandwich combo which includes waffle fries and a drink. The sandwich could use more heat to kick up the spice and make it a truly unique chicken sandwich that would make it a destination sandwich. I did like the heaping amount of mayo and pickles which would be even better on a spicier chicken breast. The waffle fries were great. They were super crispy on the outside and seasoned well. Didn't try the alcoholic drinks but it is a nice feature to have to pair with the food options. 

Will be back to try other food options in the future and will hopefully add another star because this is a great food addition to the area."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place out for a while and it was worth the wait.  The menu is very limited but who cares.  The chicken sandwich and waffle fries combo is all you need.  The chicken was moist and perfectly cooked and the pickles added a nice crunch.  The waffle fries were the perfect accompaniment.  Not a health food by any means but it really satisfies a craving."}
{"text":"I am in love! If you haven't been to Bird on the Run put it on your must visit.

Don't be surprised by the small space or menu. This place packs in the flavor. You order at the counter unpin arrival. You'll get a number to sit on your table and as your order comes out they call your number. Simple, right?

My recommendations - the spicy chicken sandwich, waffle fries and froze. What a combination! Friends in my group also had chicken nuggets and the margarita. We agreed from the first bite this is a new go to spot. When you're finished eating you dump your tray and head out the door. Simple, easy, what more could you ask for?

Be cautious this chicken sandwich is going to cost you a bit more than you may expect. Overall, really glad this place exists. Looking forward to
Many more visits."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Sandwich Ever! It was moist, crispy, and tasty! I ordered the Deluxe with Egg, Bacon and Extra Spicy! 

And the service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Had the hot chicken sandwich....too good!!! Seems like it's gonna be a frequent eating place for me."}
{"text":"Really good spicy chicken sandwich! Super crunchy waffle fries too! Look out Chic-fil-a... This rooster is the cock of the walk."}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken, you must try this place. My picture doesn't do it justice. 

Everything is made from scratch so be prepared to wait. They have people eating in and a lot of to go orders. It's a little annoying, but so worth the wait. 

My husband and I got the fried chicken sandwich combo. I had the original fried chicken sandwich and it was moist and delicious. It comes with bread and butter pickles, lettuce and mayo. My husband had the Nashville hot chicken not too spicy and really enjoyed it. We also had the waffle fries, which were really good. 

They have a couple tables where you can sit. You order at the counter and the lady who takes your order brings your order from the back. 

The decor is minimal but they have cute little chicken wallpaper. They play great classic songs. 

Go try it! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Hot Chicken last summer in Nashville so I was super excited to try out Bird on the Run. 

I love the minimal menu and southern aesthetic. I ordered a combo - a chicken sandwich with mayo and pickle on a brioche bun served with fries and a drink. The chicken was juicy and the breading was perfectly crunchy. It was a delicious sandwich and it's super dangerous knowing I can order it from Postmates. The waffle fries were fresh, homemade and crispy. I also enjoyed a Turner's tea with my meal. 

They also offer alcoholic beverages with a lot of frozen cocktails to choose from!"}
{"text":"Visited Bird on the Run after hearing rave reviews and it certainly did not disappoint. Though the menu is small and resembles what you'd find at Chick Fil A, that's about where the similarities stop. The hot chicken sandwich was spicy, but not overly so and the quality of the ingredients (oh my gosh, the bun) was great. I'm not sure what they sprinkle on the outside of their waffle fries, but it makes a huge difference. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"THE BEST spicy fried chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life.  The chicken meat is juicy and hot with a spicy crispy outer layer paired with mayo and pickles.  The perfect amount of crisp.  Love the soft brioche bun everything melts in your mouth.  The frozen cocktails are also delicious."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken sandwich I've had yet in Pittsburgh. Especially for the price I highly recommend it. Hope they maintain the quality of their product."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I have eaten there 3 times this week, im in love. Chicken tenders are so yummy and the chicken sammies are also so phenomenal. I have tried all the frozen cocktails and my favorite is the negroni, but they are also delish! today i went in hungover, and the frozen negroni and the hot chicken sandwich cured my hangover. This place is magic"}
{"text":"Overall, I had a great experience at Bird on the Run. We ordered 3 of the regular chicken stripes and 3 of the extra spicy stripes, along with an order of waffle fries and a frozen rosé cocktail. Both orders of the stripes were delicious, with crispy breading. Fair warning the extra spicy lived up to its name but I would recommend it if you like spice. The frozen rosé was a table pleaser, sweet and refreshing.

My finals thoughts: hands down the best chicken stripes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Unbelievable chicken sandwiches. Who knew that was a thing. And the Negroni slushies are to die for."}
{"text":"Simple, Straightforward, and Delicious Chicken Sandwich's and Strips. Get the extra hot with extra pickles and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Holy chicken. If you think you like fried chicken, this place is a must try!

I got the hot chicken sandwich combo with normal spiciness. They also offer extra spicy for the hot chicken. The chicken was soo juicy (and I mean really juicy!!), and the outside had the perfect amount of crunch. Every bite into it was an experience. I don't know what was in their spice mix for the chicken, but I think it might be addictive. The mayo and pickles added the perfect kick to the sandwich. Waffle fries were fine, not too greasy and a good amount of salt. I also tried their chicken strips, which is basically the same chicken that's inside the sandwiches (not complaining!). If you order the chicken strips you get the option for a BBQ, honey mustard, or ranch sauce.

This place is a casual joint, and sticks to their chicken theme with their decorations. There's a counter where you order your food, and afterwards you pick your own seat. The space is on the smaller side, with probably enough seating for about 20+ people. They'll bring your order to you when it's ready. They also have frozen cocktails on their menu, which looked amazing- I'll be back to try one for sure."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to love this place. I just moved back to the area from Nashville, and though I won't claim to be a connoisseur, I had my share of hot chicken before it's rise to national stardom.

Some of my complaints boil down to personal preference, like the level of heat (or lack thereof) and the idea that hot chicken needs a companion sauce (this is a thing of the North and it's gross). But really, if you're going to open a shop and exclusively sell fried chicken, it better be some bomb fried chicken. I've had it twice now and it's just not. Additionally, limited side options of waffle fries and mayo slaw are seriously underwhelming. Between here and Muddy Waters, they ought to be able to prep some more options like hush puppies, greens, Mac n cheese, etc.

It may just need a few more months to find its bearings, but right now everything about it just feels lethargic."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here at 12. It wasn't busy when we got there, but filled up by 1pm. Loved my regular chicken sandwich. The chicken is perfectly fried and very most and the pickles are a little sweet which I liked. And the bum didn't get in the way of the chicken at all. I didn't try any of the frozen cocktails, but they sounds very good. The waffle fries are \"eh\" , but you aren't coming here for the potatoes. 

My friend got the extra spicy chicken sandwich and said the spicy was a comfortable spice, not a melt your face spicy. So if you want spicy spicy food, don't be disappointed. Still good though.


Note: they don't have a changing table in their restrooms. Just a note for any parents who plan to stop in."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken sandwich I have ever tried anywhere. Let me emphasize that you should expect traditional soul-food style fried chicken; the focus is on fried chicken sandwiches, not producing the best fried 1/2 bird over waffles, etc. Regardless, if you declare yourself a lover of fried chicken, then you must try this place- you will not be disappointed. 
Chicken Strips- incredible. 
Drinks- amazing, we were not into the whole froze thing until we tried them and loved them."}
{"text":"Awesome food, best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Sort of like a Wendys spicy chicken but infinitely better. The french fries could be better especially since they don't have that many items on the menu."}
{"text":"Plenty of Hank Williams and Johnny Cash to go around, the concept is some kind of spicy Southern Chicken Joint. 

The menu is very limited, but what they do, they do well. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. They told me the 2 restaurants down the line are the same owner (Kahuna and Muddy Waters). 

I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, which was plenty spicy for me. I'm just trying to imagine the very spicy version. You can just let me know. 

The dining area is stripped down retro trying to be cool and probably succeeding. I was surprised they have beer, however it makes sense given the connection to the other 2 restaurants. 

Open late, that's fairly unusual for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wowwwww. If you only have a couple items on the menu, they have to be perfect, right?! SO good! and what is in the Ranch?! Rosemary or something?! Delicious!! 
Also very cozy inside! Can't wait to go back! I wanted another sandwich lol"}
{"text":"I'm loving the fried chicken shop trend in Pittsburgh. First Ki Pollo from the Umami/Ki Ramen team and now this! Bird on the Run has a solid selection of chicken sandwiches as well as strips, nuggets, and a combo option. My boyfriend got a sandwich during our inaugural visit, and he loved it. Sides include waffle fries and slaw, and I can say from experience that the fries are delicious. There are a few soft drinks available as well, but the real stars are the frozen cocktails. I had the frozen rosé and he got the frozen margarita. At $8 they were suitably strong and the perfect size. I know I'll be coming back for more, especially as the weather warms up. 

The atmosphere is paired down and neat, with a cute chicken print wallpaper and old school country (think Johnny Cash) playing in the background. You order at the counter and can either have your food (and cocktails!) brought to your table or take things to-go. Bird on the Run really is the perfect compliment to a neighborhood with so many formal sit down places, and I'm excited to see how well it's going to do!"}
{"text":"The hot  chicken sandwich was BOMB but the service was a little slow. We had to wait about 20 minutes.

We also got the chicken nuggs with no spicy and spicy. I would definitely choose the spicy over the non but both were tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and was really impressed. I had the catfish sandwish - which was a special and not on the regular menu. I hope they consider adding it - it was outstanding (fried, with a little bit of lemon, mayo, and capers and a little bit of spice. Tasty). Got the cole slaw as a side which was very good.

Wife had the spicy chx sandwich and loved it. She also had a frozen margarita - which was outstanding. We might come back just for the frozen cocktails. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for some lunch.  Bird on the run is located right on S Highland Avenue near where the Shadyside, Friendship and East Liberty neighborhoods meet.  The inside of the place is somewhat simple but in a good way.  There are tables on both the left and the right with a counter in the front.  It's walls are decorated with chicken wall paper which is fun and appropriate.

For lunch on this day I decided to go with a chicken combo.  That consists of a chicken sandwich (I chose extra hot) with mayo and pickle on a brioche bun and came with fries and a drink.  Since nothing that came with the meal really excited me drink wise (those alcoholic slushes certainly did though) I ended up choosing bottled water for my drink.  After about a 10 minute wait our food was ready.  My chicken sandwich ended up being pretty good as the breading was nice and crispy while the chicken inside was moist and juicy.  I loved the little bit of a kick that came from the spicy chicken as well.  I also enjoyed the choice of the buttery brioche bun which made it a little more decadent although I wish that they would have toasted the bun a little better.  The fries here ended up being pretty good as well as they were seasoned nicely and still hot.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I enjoyed both my chicken sandwich and fries and thought that their adult slushes looked good too!"}
{"text":"This was our first try of the new Bird On The Run.  I was in the mood for a chicken sandwich and this place did not disappoint.

It's primarily a take-out joint, but there are a few tables inside if you just can't wait to take a bite out of that golden, crispy goodness.  After this successful visit, I imagine I won't be able to wait next time either.

I'm going to skip all the pre-review chattiness and move right into the goods.

Pros (oh there are so many):
Chicken is perfectly crispy - the golden color is perfection
The buns are soft and wonderful
Sandwiches have the perfect amount of mayo on them
The waffle fries are done just right
The coleslaw has a surprisingly yummy kick to it
You get the food real quick

Cons:
The coleslaw was in a Chinese take-out container causing it to leak all over the rest of the food in the bag

So final thoughts are, this place is great! I can't say enough good things about the flavor and quality of the food.  The only real suggestion I would have is to put the slaw into a more solid container.  Other than that, we really loved not only the food, but the experience as well.  We will definitely be back for more.  And next time, we'll be trying a couple of those frozen bevies!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hot chicken sandwich that rivals what you would find in Nashville. The chicken was fantastically breaded and extremely moist. The brioche bun was toasted well and the pickles/sauce really adds a nice finishing touch. The wait was a little long but that's probably because they were making this fresh! I'll definitely be coming back here often!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich, mild, hot, extra hot is the reason to come here. And the waffle fries, when they're hot enough in temperature, complement the chicken. However their temperature seems somewhat hit or miss.  That can be tightened up in the kitchen. However, and the reason I am rating this place one less star is how you're greeted, or really not greeted, by the young lady who takes your order. The times I've been there she has the expression of someone who clearly hates her job or hates being there (which, I don't know could be because somehow she feels she's not being treated well; I don't have a clue as to why) and wants you to be miserable too. Her tone is just shy of derisive, at best she sounds very annoyed. I know the most important part of rating an eating place is the food but the person representing the establishment should at least be welcoming. No one else I've encountered in Bird on the Run has been less than happy to serve you and efficient but unfortunately the only person I've seen taking patrons' orders is JUST NOT HAPPY! I hope there's a way she could be happier."}
{"text":"This is one of my top chicken spots...possibly best in Pittsburgh. I just wish the drinks weren't so expensive!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwiches and coleslaw to go, when i got home my bag had 1 sandwich and fries. Partly my fault for not checking, but it was walked over and handed to me. My 1/2 sandwich was good, as were the fries, so i will give them another chance (since i have to return anyway for the refund!). They were friendly, but an unfortunate first experience."}
{"text":"The hot chicken sandwich was nowhere near hot enough; I was disappointed.  That said, apart from the lack of heat it was a pretty good chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing addition to the restaurant scene around Shadyside + East Lib. Bird on the run also serves alcohol which is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"A restaurant serving nothing but fried chicken? Yup, I'm on board! Although it's a bit of a stretch to call this a restaurant....it's almost like a snack bar. The food menu is pretty limited...chicken sandwiches, chicken strips or nuggets, and fries or slaw. That's it. And that's a-okay with me, because they fry up a dang good piece of chicken. 

On my inaugural visit, I got a combo meal with a hot chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and a non-alcoholic drink (their non-booze drinks are limited to Coke, Diet Coke, or Turners iced tea). The food was good....like a tasty, non-chain version of Chik-Fil-A. The chicken was juicy and the crispy breading packed a perfect zip of heat. The bun was a soft, slightly sweet brioche that was the perfect envelope for the chicken. 

However, I do have two complaints. One, my sandwich was super salty. My husband had the same sandwich as me, and his wasn't salty, so whoever made mine must've accidentally over-seasoned. And two, the waffles fries were a bit crunchy for my liking. IMHWFO (in my humble waffle fry opinion), a good waffle fry should be crispy on the outside, but have a soft, fluffy interior. These fries were just straight up crispy, which to me means that they were a tad overdone. They were still tasty, but a little less time in the fryer and they would've been perfect. 

The space itself is simple, consisting of a counter in the back for ordering and two small rows of tables lining both side walls (it's pretty small inside....there are maybe 9 or 10 tables total). The walls are adorned with chicken-themed wallpaper, which fits perfectly with the rustic-hipster vibe. My only complaint about the space is that there didn't appear to be any place to recycle (and given that they only sell their non-alcoholic drinks in cans or cartons, this is an oversight). 

Overall, not a perfect experience, but impressive enough that I'm sure this will become a regular snack spot. I'm especially interested in trying some of their frozen alcoholic cocktails next time around!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord. Blessed be the day that this establishment opened in Pittsburgh. 

 I'll admit I am not the most affluent hot chicken consumer out there, but I grew up in the south, I've been around the block a few times, therefore I feel I know my fried chicken.

 This place is a simple counter service set-up serving deep fried pieces of heaven, along with fries, coleslaw, a selection of soft drinks and frozen cocktails. 

  And now, I am going to nap away the most lovely of food comas after a delicious lunch. NOTE: It is my day-off, please be advised the resulting food coma may not be safe for work, no matter how delicious the chicken is.

Thank you for reading this somewhat hyperbolic, but overall very sincere review."}
{"text":"I had the chicken strips, waffle fries and coleslaw last Sunday... I've been craving more of that chicken ever since!  DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"I've visited this spot twice and each time I have been happy with the overall experience. While I was disappointed at their lack of traditional à la carte fried chicken options, they are good at what they do: Chicken Sandwiches.

The side options are almost nonexistent, but the chicken takes center-stage here. Prepared with a tasty brioche bun and a generous helping of pickles, the sandwich is near perfect. Boasting a few flavor varieties, the 'Hot' option offers just the right amount of heat and spice. 

The waffle fries are a great compliment to the sandwich, but I keep searching for more variety... Due to these limitations, it would be difficult to frequent Bird on the Run and expect something different each time.

In summation: If you are looking for a tasty, classed-up, Chick-fil-A clone, then this is your place."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh visiting and I'm glad we drove out of our way to check this place out. We got the hot chicken sandwich and the heat was perfect; waffle fries are good too. I'm not a bread and butter pickle person but they worked with the sandwich perfectly. Very pleased we stopped here!"}
{"text":"The hot chicken sandwiches was so good! I got coleslaw (also great) and put it on the sandwich. The wall paper is little red chickens and it's so cute! Not a big menu but they really hit the nail on the head with the chicken sandwiches and coleslaw. Good thing I work nearby so I can stop often."}
{"text":"Thier chicken nuggies are bomb.org (more legit than dot com) fam! And their prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get. I like to get them Hot with the bbq dipping sauce. Quick and fast service. My new go-to!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place... really bad. Maybe I set my expectations too high? I ordered take out here to grab for dinner on my way home from work. Staff was very friendly, so kudos on that end. I ordered the chicken sandwich, fries, and coleslaw, totaled about $17... little pricey but they make up for it with the large portions. Now this certainly could have been because I had ordered my food to go and ate when I got home... but my chicken was dry with little flavor. Surprisingly, my fav part of the meal was the coleslaw, go figure lol which I put right on my dry sandwich to help spruce it up. Definitely made a difference. I'm not even a coleslaw person, but this one has a kick to it which was perfect for my taste buds. 

I'm not ruling this spot out completely. I really wanna love it, so I plan on going back soon. Maybe an eat in will be a different taste experience :)"}
{"text":"Nice spicy chicken sandwich like you'd find in Memphis! Was driving so did not partake in the drinks but they looked good!"}
{"text":"Good portion size and presentation. Taste was lacking; I got the hot chicken and it was very bland. The fries were fine but again lacking seasoning. Price is also high compared to Chick-fil-A. In my opinion the food has more taste at Chick-fil-A than at Bird On The Run. I gave it a try since it is a local business. I would go back but will request extra condemned for flavor."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great addition to the neighborhood. $8 for a spicy chicken sandwich is worth it here. The sandwiches are not small. You can get extra spicy as well. Wife got the special spicy sandwich and it was excellent as well. Pretty quick too. Will be back soon and many times after that."}
{"text":"This place is so popping.  I freaking love it here! If y'all are a fan of fried, moist, get in my mouth kind of chicken, then yes yes yesssss this is the place to go.  It's in a great location in East Liberty and it's open late to 1am!  It's perfect.  I've been here more than a handful of times and I react the same way every damn time.  The hot chicken sandwich is exactly what it gives you, HOT.  If you can handle the heat, go for it.  The second? time around I went for a milder choice of just the regular chicken sandwich with a side of coleslaw."}
{"text":"Finally a fried chicken spot in Pittsburgh! This place definitely delivers an awesome fried chicken sandwich. I ordered the hot chicken combo which came with a can of pop and an order of waffle fries. The chicken breast was moist and juicy. The breading had good seasonings and didn't fall apart when you ate it.  The hot sauce had good flavor and wasn't overpowering or overly spicy, it was perfect! 

If you like fried chicken sandwiches, Bird On The Run is the place to go in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"All I've been waiting for is a place in Pittsburgh that has a worthwhile fried chicken sandwich at an affordable price. Bird on the Run provides great fried chicken sandwiches at an awesome price point. Combos with fries are solid. I like to top my sandwich with coleslaw. They also have beer.

The atmosphere is a little busy and the service was just a bit off. The sauces are big-box packets but the chicken is homemade and worth it and I am so happy that there's now a place to satisfy my fried chicken sandwich cravings."}
{"text":"I've been there three times since it opened last week and think it's a great addition to the neighborhood.  The chicken is fried perfectly and the fries are awesome."}
{"text":"The BEST chicken sandwich I've ever had. It's crispy, juicy chicken, with amazing flavor!  The Cole slaw and waffle fries are just as good! Great service and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Little fried chicken joint on highland ave. Very similar to a chick fil a type of style, but thankfully lacking the intolerance and including booze.
Initially I ordered the frozen margarita which tasted like straight up tequila and robitussin cough syrup. The owner was super cool and let me try the frozé frozen rosé instead - this was more strawberry daiquiri than wine; super sweet but fine.
The food was super tasty and reasonably priced. My husband got the hot chicken sandwich (which he enjoyed so much he went back the next day for another) and I got the chicken nuggets. The chicken was super juicy and the breading was really good!
Pleasantly surprised with this place. Not a ton of seating, maybe 4 four person tables and 4 two tops. Many people were ordering to go when I was there.
Definitely would stop in again when I'm craving some fried chicken (sandwiches, strips, nuggets)."}
{"text":"I went back! FYI you can call ahead to order so your food will be ready for pickup! I stuck with my chicken sandwich but my friends tried the catfish sandwich and LOVED it even more than the chicken! The only downside is they don't do the combo offer for the catfish which is a bummer :/"}
{"text":"Can I say wow!  Now that's a awesome chicken sandwich!  I ordered the spicy chicken and wow!  Perfectly seasoned, not overly spicy (like it wasn't just dusted with cayenne pepper to make it hot).  The fries were good as well, not swimming in oil or salt!  Yep, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The team from Muddy Waters does an amazing job at filling the major gaps in the Pittsburgh food scene. The chicken and fries are fried to the perfect level of crispy and service is quick and friendly. I would honestly make a stop here just for the frozen drinks. Tried and loved the Zombie, but was tempted by all!

My only critique is that there should be multiple levels of heat for the hot chicken. I can barely handle heat (my mouth is on fire with just a tiny squirt of sriracha) and was fine after taking a couple bites of my date's hot chicken."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place ever since we saw the delicious fried chicken hot sammy on Instagram. 

Omg. So so good. We crushed everything. Coleslaw was creamy, sliced really thin. WAFFLE FRIES. The bread was really good that the chicken came on. 

I got hot. my girlfriend got the brand new XXXhot. Both were really pleasant heat levels. The seasoning is super fire and a little cajuny. Writing this is making me want to go back for lunch today tbh. 

You can get cans of beer for $2.50!! Turners Lemonade and Coke Cans. 

The service was outstanding. I think it was the manager who made the experience excellent. He helped us choose, didn't rush our orders and even checked on us, and cleared our table."}
{"text":"As others have said, the menu is small but boy is it good!  My associate took a couple of bites and I heard \"Yum, this is so good\".  I agree the chicken is very tasty and moist, not that dried out stuff you get at many places.  My Lil Chunky's Chicken Deluxe had bacon, pickle green tomato, spicy mayo, lettuce on a brioche bun.  A tasty sandwich.  We split an order of the Coleslaw.  A pretty good slaw.  
Service was very friendly.  
There are a few frozen drinks on the menu that looked interesting, next time."}
{"text":"The owners of Muddy Waters and Kahuna bring you their latest addition to their conglomerate of restaurants: Bird on the Run! Upon entering, you're greeted with a very humble interior - a bunch of tables on both sides of the restaurant with the ordering counter in the back center. The walls are lined with chicken print wallpaper (where can I get this for my own room?) to let you know that you're definitely in a chicken shop. The menu is simple but everything on it looks absolutely delicious, and their frozen cocktail selection looks incredibly interesting. 

After waiting about 10 minutes, I  had my order in hand. I opted for the Combo which consists of a chicken sandwich (can be made hot-style), waffle fries, and a drink (non-alcoholic, unfortunately) all for $11. The prices look very reasonable, especially for the frozen cocktails. 

The waffles fries were textbook perfect!! Crispy all around yet full and fluffy on the inside. This is how you do waffle fries. 

The hot chicken sandwich comes on a fluffy brioche bun, a standard mayo, and a sizable spicy chicken breast with a dense, flaky breading. Has just enough heat to make your lips tingle and nose sniffle. Even if you don't handle spiciness well, don't be intimidated by the Hot Chicken Sandwich - it's an enjoyable spiciness. However, next time I would probably pass on the mayo next time I go for the sandwich. There was way too much on the sandwich for my liking. Also the sandwich comes in a little pocket bag (kind of like Shake Shack) so the hot oil easily drips out of the sandwich - make sure you have napkins stocked in the car if you get it to go! 

Would absolutely love to see them offer different spice levels for the Heatonists out there, and perhaps some better take out packaging prep.

I will definitely return whenever I'm in the mood for hot chicken, and especially for some proper waffle fries (Chic fil a take notes), and I definitely plan on trying their amazing looking frozen cocktails. All in all, pretty enjoyable given that it's been less than 48 hours since they opened."}
{"text":"I stopped in here half expecting another variation of Chick fil-a. To my surprise I was taken aback with my meal! This meal was delicious!  Bird on the Run opened last week in East Liberty next to Kahuna and Muddy Waters Oyster Bar. All three are run by the same people.

I had a very friendly staff lady who told me that their chicken is fried in house and normally takes 6-7 minutes to prepare. Although most people order take out they do have tables set up for eat in dining. You can choose either a  chicken sandwich, \"not spicy, spicy, or very spicy hot\" I was told. It comes with mayo and pickle chips on a brioche bun. They also have chicken strips and nuggets. If you wish to be more daring then you can order the chicken deluxe which comes with bacon, egg, pickled green tomato, spicy mayo, and cheese on a brioche bun.

Combos are also available which give you a choice of waffle fries or coleslaw and an non alcoholic beverage. Their cocktails are frozen and run $10.00.

Free WiFi is available. Pass code provided upon request. I ordered the regular not spicy chicken and side along with ice tea. I would suggest going that route because you save a few dollars on the beverage which also includes refrigerated bottled water.

When I got my food I could tell the difference that this chicken was fresh, cooked to order, and not greasy. The waffle fries were crisp and the coleslaw not runny like I would have found in Chick fil-a. I did notice that my chicken had a salty taste to it as a previous reviewer had mentioned. i pointed that fact out to the lady who waited on me and she appreciated my comment. She told me that the chef has a tendency to put salt on the chicken at the last minute before serving it. We agreed that salt should be given as a side like ketchup and let the consumer decide.

This is a very reasonably priced fast casual restaurant in East Liberty that caters to everyone. It is a welcome addition to a redeveloping neighborhood in the Burgh."}

I love love love this place! 
The hot chicken sandwich (on brioche roll) and waffle fries are all a girl could dream of. I'm not kidding!
I am always so insistent on taking pics of my food especially at a new place. But here I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into that juicy chicken!! I'll get pics next time for sure.
So about the chicken-when I say it's juicy, I kid you not and the flavor. Woo-wee!!! So much flavor! If you like hot chicken as much as I do then you'll dig on this. The seasonings hit your tongue and throat at just the right level sending such a feeling of content to the brain and stomach. Simultaneously.
And the waffle fries, holy waffle fries. They are so freaking delicious. I can't even stand it. Cooked to perfection with amazing flavor.
This is definitely a take away joint but they have a couple of tables if you want to sit in.
Friendly counter help. The worker took the time to explain things and assist in decision making.
Get there as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this chicken joint, but alas I was a little disappointed. I went twice in 72 hours. Tried the combo with both regular and hot chicken sandwiches, waffle fries and ye olde trusty Turner's iced tea. Got some chicken strips to share with my kid, as well. Yes, it's all fresh and made to order. Yes, it's tasty. But no, my mind is not exactly blown. The hot chicken wasn't very hot, so next time I'll ask for it extra spicy. Further the mayo seemed more like a take on dijonnaise. Waffle fries were fresh 'n crispy, but I'm on the fence with the addition of what looked and tasted like cornmeal. The chicken strips were the highlight for me -- moist, super tender and just the right amount of seasoning. Perhaps I'll start with a frozen cocktail and ask for the \"mayo\" on the side next time I'm in the mood for some bird. I do appreciate the simplicity of BotR, from the menu to the dining space, and hope it continues to do well. Only time will tell."}
{"text":"I wanted to not like this place because I miss my what was here before. They won me over with flavor. It's fine take my money. 

The interior is hip wallpaper and reclaimed wood. The menu is simple, chicken sandwiches, chicken strips, chicken nuggets, waffle fries and coleslaw. The chicken comes in different levels of spice. I tried the spicy chicken little chunky sandwich and regular chicken nuggets.

 The chicken in all forms is delicious, tender, flavorful magic. Juicy chicken fried perfectly. The sandwich is served with fresh veggies on a tender brioche bun. You can get it with bacon and egg too. The sauce options for the nuggets were underwhelming.  I wish the ranch and honey mustard were house made also a BBQ sauce wouldn't hurt.

The waffle fries are so good it's really unfair. You will gaze at the fry after first bite and wonder how it was done. I wish they had cheese sauce. 

The coleslaw was not impressive and since this place is not cheap, I'd suggest skipping it.

They also have craft beer and frozen alcoholic beverages that I didn't get to try as we arrived close to closing. I also saw a sign for a chicken sandwich on a glazed donut weekend special I plan to try."}
