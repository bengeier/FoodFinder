{"text":"Just visited! My daughter got a hand spun caramel milkshake. Best she ever had in her life! I got the big kahuna sandwich. Beef patty with fried egg, ham, pineapple on a wheat bread covered with toasted coconut.....DREAMY! It was like biting into a little bit of heaven! Service was good, restaurant was clean, food was delicious"}
{"text":"The 50's diner in Mentor, OH has a great business model. Not only make your customer happy and make them come back for more, but serve quality food. I am the biggest advocate for bashing large restaurant chains for their food quality, nutrition, and service. After consuming a few meals at the 50's diner, you realize their quality is up their with Heinen's or Whole Foods.   One morning I chose to eat a Mexican skillet before golfing a round. The skillet was larger than I had ever been served before and I was unable to eat it. The green peppers were so fresh, you could tell they were just cut and grilled in a pan. This is the type of food, most educated (Food-wise) and healthier indviduals desire.  I reccomend this restaurant for any meal, plus the service is great. The only reason i chose to give it a four and not a five star is mainly because they don't advertise enough. Restaurants need to promote, I'll ay it again, any owner loves his restaurant to be taking reservations one week in advance. There is areaosn for it."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Mentor, no places have survived at this location thus far (nor deserved to in my opinion) until this place. Classic hand-dipped milkshakes and great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first time there and I couldn't have been happier. The place is so cute and the 50's music just adds to the whole experience. I ordered the chicken salad sandwhich on a toasted croissant. I got the fresh cut fries with mine although my options were, soup, salad or fries. The chicken salad was one of the best I have ever had. Very homemade tasting. The fries were good, I'm not a fresh cut fry fan so I wouldn't rave even if they were the best. My boyfriend ordered the double cheeseburger and he was very happy. He also ordered one of the breakfast skillets, he's still talking about how good it was. The portions are big enough that you leave full and most likely with a to go box. Prices were great for such awesome food. My sandwhich was $5.99 on the lunch specials menu. The burger and skillet were each around $9 not bad either, considering the size and quality. Overall I was really happy we stopped to check this place out. Can't wait to go back SOON!"}
{"text":"The place does look nice I will give it that but the food and service are severely lacking.  I got a burger and fries it was terrible the burger was tough and over done.  I overheard the owner bragging about using 80/20 beef in the burgers and the service was just so-so."}
{"text":"Fun, fun place!! You walk in to a great decor. Our waitress said that a lot of their food was prepared fresh... So we tried their hand dipped onion rings... Great! My wife ordered the hamburger and it looked pretty good (not great). I had the ripper which was a deep fried hotdog with BBQ sauce, onions, and cheddar cheese. I really liked it. Their fresh cut fries were \"ok\". Overall, not bad. We'll probably be back one more time."}
{"text":"The banana peanut butter milk shake is really good. Not too sweet just perfect. However the burger is different view. I ordered Route 66 burger. The burger was not cooked correctly. The fried egg on the burger was fried hard instead of runny. The hamburger patty is dry but still pink in the middle. My guess is whoever cooked the burger must have pressed the burger too much. I have used frozen patties before and still maintain juiciness. It's the person who cooks it killed the burger. The hand cut fries could be crispier.  Hopefully they can correct this problem. The decor of the place brings you back to the 50's diner. Only need to get the food to go along with it."}
{"text":"Wow, if there were no stars I would have rated them with that. Not sure where to start actually but here goes. We had a \"welcome to the neighborhood\" coupon for a free burger and fries so we decided to give this place a shot before going to see a movie. He ordered the burger with the pulled pork on it and had it cooked medium. I in turn ordered the ravioli which they were out of so I was asked for a second choice, I decided on pinky tuscadero pasta. It was a penne in a garlic cream sauce. Supposed to be served with a salad but after 20 min of waiting, no salad, no food. Finally here comes our \"heat lamp\" burning plates. His burger was over well done and was under the lights so long it made the lettuce wilty and brown. My plate was okay but it's a little hard to mess up noodles and sauce. Nothing came in it as stated on the menu. Our waitress was too busy talking about going back to school with another table to notice that we needed drinks or a salad maybe? Upon her arrival I asked for my salad to go and some crushed red pepper for my flavorless noodles. She brings back the jar of crushed red with some dust and hair stuck to the bottom of it. Needless to say I did not use it or finish my plate. After waiting another 20 min for the check we decided to take it upon ourselves to go to the cashier. Where our waitress rushes over with a salad in a to go box, opened it up, wrong dressing! Left it on the counter. The cashier asked us how everything was and when we said we were displeased it went in one ear and out the other. No manager to be found. I wasn't going to complain because the last thing I wanted for a resolution was a gift card to return to the place. You would think with the kind of coupon we presented upon ordering, they would try a little harder for a first time customer...after today, We will not return."}
{"text":"This new diner on Mentor Avenue is adorable! You'll feel like you've been transported back to the 50's with the timeless tunes, big booths and diner decor. The owners have big plans for this space and Mentor is ready for them.  They are still working on the menu but what they have is a good start paying homage to the comfort food of yesterday. Breakfast in typical diner fashion is served all day. I'm a skillet kind of gal but thought everything needed to be a little hotter. I did like that my dish came with chicken, tomatoes, potatoes, cheese, broccoli and eggs but would have liked a heavier hand with the veggie. There was (of course) a side of heavily buttered toast (who can resist that really). Coffee was OK.  There is so much potential at the Fifty's Diner and I look forward to coming for another visit in the City of Choice (aka Mentor)."}
{"text":"Had 2 burgers, one guacamole/bacon, one mushroom/Swiss. Asked for both medium rare. Toppings were excellent and plenty of them. Pleased overall. However, burgers themselves were dry, and a little disconcerting: pink in the middle, but a brightish pink, yet dry. I don't know how they manage to keep the middle looking pink -- and there was a very distinct border between the pink and the rest of the burger -- but still cook it to the consistency of a medium to medium well. Frozen to start, maybe?  Fries were ok -- dark, not crispy but not very greasy either. Limp.  Definitely money put into the decor, comfy booths, bright and clean.   Would be willing to give it a second chance. But looks like second tier for area, behind likes of Stevenson's, Kirtland Tavern and Burgers, Beer and Breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously cute. Now, I'm an 80s kid however, if I was born in the 50s I could only hope everything looked like it did in there. They have taken an old Chicago Uno's restaurant and turned it into a 50's style diner, complete with decor and everything.  My sis and I went for breakfast with her ordering the french toast and myself the corn beef hash. Their breakfasts are HUGE and for on the cheap! The waitress was very pleasant and attentive. My sister, who is practically a human garbage disposal, couldn't even finish her meal since the toast was a serious, delicious giant. I tried but failed to finish.   All-in-all, a great place to go eat breakfast if you want to be able to listen to great 50s music and grab a good bite in a solid little restaurant. I will be visiting again for sure."}
{"text":"Update:  Still great!  Breakfast omelette is huge!  Food and service is always fast!  The atmosphere and music is uplifting, always leave the diner in a great mood!"}
