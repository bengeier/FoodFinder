{"text":"I had the \"Hot Lap Sandwich\", which was a (not too) spicy shredded chicken sandwich with a cilantro jalape√±o crema, provolone cheese, on a brioche bun. I had the pub chips on the side. M'lady had the pulled pork. It too was fantastic. We got a double order of the pub chips for the long drive home.
The service was excellent, the drink selections at the bar were abundant, and the facilities were clean. They also have indoor go-karts."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to stop by on our way through NC. The food was delicious. Highly recommend the hot lap sandwich. Great flavors. Could really taste the smoke in the pulled pork sandwich. Fries were run of the mill. Prices are fair. Went early on a Saturday afternoon. Hardly anyone in the place. Decor is neat. Pool table and skeeball in the restaurant. Watch the racers from your table. Would go back if I lived close. Might dream of the hot lap sandwich."}
{"text":"It's all about the go-carting and not the food.  Food was average at best. Service was lacking.  One person behind the bar doing everything.  She was nice but for the amount of people and tables, she should have had help.  Also tables were not clean.  I had the specialty chicken sandwich and it was over cooked.  Disappointing to see endorsement by Food Network."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere! I really enjoyed my first time and definitely plan on coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy Moon Pie Sliders, killer wings, great burgers and a tap tower of local craft brews, all this in the middle of the nations oldest and greatest indoor kart track. What a country!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled or intimidated by the factory type of building and business park, this place is great! I travel a lot for work and am always interested in finding hidden gems and this place qualifies. The hot lap sandwich is so good I ordered another one to go and eat at the airport. Not really all that spicy, just right. Staff, Dijuan at the bar, is really nice and accommodating and although it's a racetrack the facility is clean and nice. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I think this concept is really neat - let the kids ride go karts, and the grownups can watch, and enjoy food and some drinks at the bar. You don't come here for a top-notch meal, but you can still get pretty good food and drink. (Not many vegetables available, FYI!)

I was interested in trying some of the main points from DDDs, which I did, and I'm not super impressed. The choices are unique, though, and I give them credit for that. Drinks are a little overpriced. They do have a full bar though, which is nice, as well as a few select wines. 

The moonpie sliders are actually pretty good. I was a little hestitant, though I love chocolate and I love burgers. I didn't really taste the candied bacon, though, which I think would have added a whole new element. They were a good appetizer, though. I tried the Concord for my main meal (From DDD). I was especially drawn in from the fig preserve spread, as I love figs, over the steak filet with blue cheese. This dish didn't do it for me. The steak was a little too hard and chewy, and the blue cheese crumbles just weren't working. I wouldn't order this again, sadly. The hot lap sandwich that my husband ordered seemed to be the more popular winner, with the shredded chicken and mozzerella cheese. 

This is a great laid back atmosphere to hang out, have a few drinks, and if you're crazy, try some go karts."}
{"text":"Food was on point. Get the hot lap nachos. They are amazing. Also amazing beer selection that is eclectic and local. Also excellent staff and met the owner. Seems like he put a lot of work into this place.

I'm from Chicago and driving from NC to GA. I don't write reviews but I wanted to write one because at first when I realized it was in a go cart place I almost didn't come, but I am glad I did... you will be too."}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Great facility and the restaurant has a great view of the racing. 
The food in the restaurant was as good as advertised. Not anything that will change your life but definitely better than your average bar food."}
{"text":"In town for a football game and was looking for a place to have a snack. Awesome food and decor!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and you would never know something so amazing would be in an indoor kart track! I'm visiting from California and saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dive and it did NOT disappoint! The nachos and burgers were spot on and the people working were so nice. Plus they have giant jenga! I mean what else could you want?!?"}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives\", with Guy Fieri. I seriously think Guy Fieri smoked a  large amount of marijuana before he ate at this shithole.  First warning sign for me should have been the fact we were the only ones eating at 6:30 pm. We ordered the two sandwiches that he ate on the show, \"Concord \", filet cubes  on a ciabata roll with a mission fig paste and blue cheese crumble. The filet was undercooked but tender and the paste was too sweet. French fries were even undercooked. The second was the \"Hot Lap\" chicken sandwich.  Also on a ciabata roll with a jalapeno crema sauce. Chicken was shredded, somewhat tender but the crema dressing was overpowering, very spicy, I like spicy but this was too much.  We also ordered nachos, just terrible.  Looked like they opened a bag of chips and threw it in the microwave with some cheese.  Even the fountain drinks were flat and tasteless. To top it off,  the waiter tried to overcharge us for our soft drinks that we didn't order.  So, I deducted it from his tip.  Just to make sure I glanced into the kitchen to see if the chef was the same one from the show and it was.  Guy, I need to smoke the same stuff you do, it's obvious we didn't experience the same quality meal here, I don't think anyone else will either.  Not only will we never eat here again, don't think I will be watching that stupid show again either.  We had to go and get something else to eat at another location to get the taste out of our mouths. ******also, very important ****** I recommend bringing your concealed carry weapon just in case.  The other crowd hanging out there didn't look too friendly."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've ever had honestly the honey hot Asian wings were so freaking GOOD!!! I keep coming back for them the fries are really good too"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after seeing Guy Fieri's episode featuring Charlotte.  I tried the Hot Lap sandwich.  I was expecting a little more flavor altering seeing it made on the show.  It was ok, a solid 3 out of five.  The dining area is dark, yet does provide a place to watch the karts go around the track."}
{"text":"I can see why the Triple D went there. I was there last week and order the buger and I was extremely please. The quality of the meat was exceptional for a game centered facility.  I can't wait to go back and order another Burger. My only complaint would be the coke was slightly flat simple fix the carbination to syrup ratio is off."}
{"text":"They have a vast variety of legendary bar food and cold flowing adult beverages. 

Most of the barkeeps are friendly and easy to deal with.

Chef Donnie is THE MAN! Cool to see Guy Fieri add PRBG to this list of his visited establishments on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."}
{"text":"if they had paid the heat bill it would have been a 5 Star rating. Awesome food, would never believe it inside a warehouse complex. great wings & cold beer."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, go-karts aside, this restaurant definitely stands alone as a great dining destination.  Part of the charm is the awesome bartenders/waitstaff - all of the ladies are super nice.

There's a a large selection of brew - gotta love seeing locals represented - plus a good-sized cocktail menu.

I've tried the cheese sticks (love classics done well), nachos (nice spicy bite), redneck taters (basically bbq potato skins - yum!), and burgers (huge - only get the double if you dare) and have always been impressed.  One note:  you do need to place your order at the bar, but they will bring it out to your table once your meal is ready.

Ambiance is good, there are 4 TVs over the bar, so sitting there or at one of the counters looking out over the track is your best bet, but there are a lot of additional tables if you have a larger group.  They've got a couple of games to pass the time - 2 skee ball machines, 2 sets of cornhole, and a jenga-type game - plus the venue overlooks the track so you can watch the races and see live scores projected onto the wall (always fun to see how you stack up against the competition!).  It would be nice if they added a few more arcade games for folks waiting on an order or between races.

They do host a lot of corporate events, so if you're looking for a place to stage an event, or even if you only need a caterer, you know the food is sure to be good.

All in all, it's a fun locale just north of uptown Charlotte, right off the I-77/I-85 intersection, and definitely worth a weeknight/weekend visit."}
{"text":"First, 5/5 on the food this visit. Hot lap
Nachos and sandwich are my go too. 

Service 0/5. I really should have called the manager on this. We ordered 3 hot lap sandwiches and a cheeseburger as entrees. It CLEARLY states on the menu that \"ALL sandwiches and burgers come with a side (French fries, tater tots.. Etc) and you can upgrade to a side salad for $1 of you are looking for a fresh green side. Btw the server asked how I like my chicken... Uh, fully cooked?! What kind of a question is that? He replied that oh some customers like their chicken crispy and burnt... I've never heard of this in my life. 


The server took our order and came back with just the sandwiches (and also messed up the additions on the cheeseburger but my friend was too nice to say anything) no sides. I love the seasoned fries here so I was pretty disappointed my entree was missing them. When I called the sever back and asked him for the included sides.. He told me it's only available on request....so I won't get the side included with the entree I paid for like the menu states because I didn't request it??? Wtf kind of policy is that? It's the sever's responsibility to know these things and ask which side I want. I'm not sure if it was his first day or he was a little off that day but I made him read the with me and he just said oh ok and asked who wanted fries. Uh, EVERYONE who got jipped out of their side! Why would I call you back and ask for just me?! So he finally brought us our fries, YUM. The hot lap sandwiches were also served on brioche instead of ciabatta like stated on the menu, I'm sure this was to save money. He also did not refill our water once, I had to go up to the bar and ask for water. But of course, he only refilled 2 out of the 4 glasses. 

When the check came around, he charged us $3.00 a piece for the fries that were already included with my entree. Needless to say we were furious. I had to come up to the bar and have him adjust it. He looked at me for a second and thought about putting up a fight but the look I my face was all he needed to turn around and comp the sides that were not supposed the be charged for. 

Seriously unacceptable. I feel like Pit Road's kitchen staff and servers are cutting corners to save what like 20 cents by not giving sides included with entrees and proper buns. That's cheap as fuck. I hope management isn't in cahoots with them. Pit road bar and grill, get your act together."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. Guy F has not let us down yet. The Hot Lap and Concord sandwiches. Went in during a road trip. Dont think this is just some snack bar at a kart track people. We even got to talk to the chef and try some samples of other things, AWESOME.  I just wish we were local, to be able to be here and try everything else on the menu. Kudos, sir."}
{"text":"So, so good. Hot lap was ridiculously awesome. Inventive, delicious fare in a great atmosphere. We went on a road trip so we didn't get to hang around and race... Maybe next time!"}
