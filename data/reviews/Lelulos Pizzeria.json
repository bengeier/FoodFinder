{"text":"Best pizza joint in the plum/penn hills area! Get a pie with their \"sweet sauce\". DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Amazing sweet sauce! Awesome and friendly service. This is honestly my favorite pizza joint ever. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my wife due to the 18\" pizza for $9 sign out front, it didn't disappoint. The staff is amazingly friendly, upon placing our order they asked what type of sauce we wanted, she said oh you haven't been here before? Said hold on, went to the back and brought out 2 cups with each sauce in them and a roll cut up to try the sauce. Customer service alone this place is remarkable! Then the pizza came out, wow it was huge! Crispy and wonderful. We also got a hoagie, their bread is amazing and it was cooked perfectly. This will be my new go to pizza spot in the Plum area. Do yourself a favor and check it out, also try the sweet sauce!"}
{"text":"I got a buffalo chicken pizza here a few weeks ago when I moved back to Plum, and everyone who helped me move raved about how good it was...for good reason! Honestly, it was the best buff chick pizza that I've ever had! Food was prepared quickly and the service was great. You've got a new regular customer in me!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite local pizza place. Love their sweet sauce and the garlic dipping sauce. The portions are always huge. It's the biggest pizza I've seen. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It is a shame but this place has the worst customer service. They delivered the wrong pizza once. When I called to tell them about the mistake they made me bring the pizza back to get the correct order. I thought I would give them another try today. I looked up what I wanted online and called in the order. It was more than the posted price. I asked if I order online would it cost less. She said they didn't get a chance to update the website but wouldn't honor the posted price. They just have horrible customer service. I suggest you buy your pizza somewhere else. I told my daughter what happened and she said none of her friends order from there. They have all had bad experiences."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Super excited to find such great pizza so close to home. And delivery to my door where most are too lazy to deliver to. So appreciate having a new pizza place. 5***** star rating! Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is always exceptional and the service is great. I have to say that the price isn't bad at all either.  This is the best pizza business in the Plum area and we highly recommend it.  You cannot go wrong for quality pizza and sides.  

The specialty pizzas are truly amazing and the chicken salad is sizable and fresh.   Never have we had anything but perfect food from here."}
{"text":"Place looks a little dirty the pizza crust was soggy and sucked the Italian hoagie was ok nothing specialI wouldn't go back there was only one guy answering the phone ringing orders and cooking without washing his hand at any time"}
{"text":"Dear Lord. That crust. I could eat it for days. And I'd be the size of a dwarf planet, but I would be so happy. It is actually the best crust I have ever had. 

Their sweet sauce is so delicious, I mean you can't go wrong with pizza, right? But you can go like SUPER right and they do it to it at Lelulo's. 

We actually ended up there because they do these mini pizza maker nights where kids can come make their own pizza, and it is way cool. So definitely good for families, definitely good food, and great service. Go to there."}
{"text":"After seven years of hearing how great this place was/is, my family and I decided to give them a try... Boy we were not disappointed! We ordered a large one topping pizza with there \"sweet sauce\" and it did not disappoint extremely flavorful and tasty. The crust was seasoned with a (hint) garlic mix- Best of both worlds eating pizza and having a yummy breadstick to finish it off.  The four out of five (constructive feedback) the center of the pizza was slightly soggy, in the future I believe it can be fixed just by cooking the pie a little bit longer. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"It's great to have Vegan options in Plum. Love supporting a small hardworking business."}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. The staff cleaned the oven to make sure that I had a safe eating experience.  The price for a gluten free pie is pretty high, but the work they put into it made the price well worth it. I wish that I could have their pizza everyday!"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a place to eat and kill time before my sons baseball game when we found Lelulos. Not only was the manager super friendly the food was fast, affordable, and really good! We love the sweet sauce and the buffalo chicken fries were a favorite! Please note this place is under new management and is well worth a try!"}
