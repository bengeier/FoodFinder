{"text":"it's such a hidden location.. It's inside a beauty studio and there's no sign. I spoke to the owner and he said they will be closing in 2 wks & will be moving to San Diego. A small frappe was 3.95, a bit much I think. Coffee was ok. Place is already CLOSED!"}
{"text":"Lito and Ross are amazing! Not to mention the food is delicious, gotta try it all! I've gotten several friends and coworkers hooked. The chili lime caramel corn is delish, everything you could ask for in a snack, the bag never lasts long. I have to deliver it and various other treats to my friends on the East Side when I visit. They make their own caramel and granola (a treat in itself, try it in the parfait). Always try the various specials they bring out."}
{"text":"Cafe Lito is awesome. I've tried several things and they are all outstanding. The food specials are awesome but the snacks are what bring me back again and again. The carmel pretzel sticks are to die for, especially the orange and lemon. The star of the show is the chili lime carmel corn. It is the best food when you need a little snack!  I would reccomend Cafe Lito to everyone. It is worth discovering."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden spot! The coffee and coffee drinks are good and reasonably priced.  And the food and snacks are so yummy.  Almost everything is made from scratch...it doesn't get much better than that!"}
