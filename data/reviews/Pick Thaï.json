{"text":"Great place and excellent food and service.  Diverse menu and staff can lead you towards what is popular and tasty.  

Well done!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place. The ambiance and the decor are stunning adding to your experience. I happened to be passing by and walked into place. I decided to ask for a table by just glancing at the interiors. The food was divine, it was tasteful and fresh as can be. The service was excellent. I will surely visit the place again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best resto of Mtl! No kidding  the food is more than delicious! The costumer service... AMASING! #BESTThaï essayez-le! La deco est magnifique et très chaleureuse tout comme la proprio ^^"}
{"text":"This my favourite restaurant! I am retired from the UN and I travelled a lot and visited many restaurants during my long career of 25 years. I am sensitive to the quality of food and exotic ambiance! Particularly Asian food. I highly recommend the restaurant to gourmet and people with developed taste buds. The menu is affordable taking into account the quality and generosity of the portions served with respect and honesty! People addicted to MacDonald's or cafeteria food will not find at Pick Thai what they might be looking for. Variety is the spice of life. In my opinion, and when I look for extraordinary taste buds experience, I like to indulge myself with more than salt and pepper!"}
{"text":"Wow. Call to order take out or pick up as indicated on Yelp and I'm told they are too busy to take my order (unheard of for a Thai restaurant to turn people away). I've enjoyed this restaurant many times and find this to be terrible service. Disappointed, 37 weeks pregnant and just not able to sit in for dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure what to make of this restaurant- was there May 15th on a Monday night - requested a quiet table and was placed in front of the bar- it was almost empty - had to request a change of seating- food is good- but at these prices and portions I can go somewhere else in the city....at half the price- requested a bottle of sake and they only had carafes.... so switched to white wine- pricey and a big to do for ..... a simple meal for  over $22  plus appetizers (tiny-tiny) wine, -came to over $100 plus tip.... personally I am out quite a bit and find this restaurant over rated."}
{"text":"Best thai restaurant we tried by far. Made me crave for tom yum seafood all the time! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time here. I heard good things so tried it out. Overall unimpressed. Food was good, although portions are on the small side and my dish was missing an important ingredient the menu said it would have. But it had taken so long to arrive, I wasn't going to mention it. Although, even if I had wanted to complain, I couldn't have. Our waitress ignored us after dropping off the dishes. Never came by to ask how everything was, never filled our glasses, never offered us dessert, never even gave us the bill... we had to go ask for it. 
The decor is nice but, unfortunately I'm not likely to return. For the prices they charge, I expect good service... at very least decent service. This was non-existent service."}
{"text":"One of the top thai restaurants I've been to. They accommodated a chef tasting . Everything was outstanding from appetizers through multiple tastings- well executed well presented . Dead on from a Thai perspective- heat, flavor, variety.

Picked as a result of both yelp and trip advisor - both were dead on.

If you're looking for original Thai in Montreal this is the place. Literally right across from the metro. 

Do it ......"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff. Went there for weekday lunch: 15$ lunch express menu came with the chef's choice appetizer which was a delicious mango salad. Main dish was a generous portion of chicken Pad Thai which was very good."}
{"text":"My suggestion is to take the Pad Thai. 

It'll be enough food. The curries are for people who eat like birds unless you order 4 bowls of rice and 2 appetizers.

I don't go here as often but it is nice to come here for dinner, moreso than lunch. Lunch, you can only order from a sheet of paper, not from the full menu."}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch and both times left pretty impressed. Although their portions are small, Pick Thai has a nice lunch menu with delicious curries and stir fries. Their desserts are also on point, but the best thing on the menu? Hands down, it's their mango salad. I could just eat 28 bowls of that stuff on it's own. So flavorful and packed with amazingness, I'd give the restaurant all the stars I could just for the salad. But alas, it only comes in a small portion and is gone before you know it! Docked a star for their smaller portions but totally delicious place that I'd love to check out for dinner one day!"}
{"text":"Went here halloween and so glad we did. You can't tell by looking at the building from outside but they put allot of work into the decor, you feel sheltered from the city.
The food was very good, really enjoyed the shrimp red curry and chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying Pick Thai after hearing positive reviews. 

However, when we showed up at 5:45 pm, the host simply told us that we had no reservation. He refused to check the reservation list to see what happened and was not apologetic. Even after showing him that a call was made, he simply said he wouldn't seat us. The restaurant was basically empty at that time. 

This caused my friends and I to have to search for another restaurant last minute and was quite frustrating. When I called, I was told my reservation was confirmed. 

Clearly, this restaurant is not interested in customer service and is just relying on the success of a high profile review. I'd \"pick\" another Thai restaurant.

Update (4/23): The owner of the restaurant reached out to me very quickly after this review was posted. She was very apologetic and willing to re-accommodate us. I'll post an updated review after our return."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Thai food. Lots of variety in the menu and really fresh ingredients. 
Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here varies per dish. Their Pad Thai really might be the best in the city (the only reason it's not getting less stars) but everything else is just good/OK and not worth the price. 

On top of that, the service is awkward and lacklustre. I think they had one man working the kitchens on the night we dined there because our orders came out 5 minutes apart... and we were a group of 6. That meant that some of us sat with untouched food in front of us and got to watch it go cold for 20-30 minutes. 

Perhaps it's better worth your time (and money) to go at lunch when they have a table d'hote special."}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of dishes for take out and we ate at home.  We had a great variety of appetizers, mains, curries, and of course, pad Thai.  

I noticed a lot of the dishes did have the same veggies on repeat.  The green curry included lychees which I found quite interesting.  Good flavours. The mango salad was pretty solid.  The mains were decently portioned and they use good sized prawns.  The fresh rolls were individually wrapped in plastic and so they retained moisture which was nice.  Not a fan of the noodles.  They were too clumpy.  

I didn't realize the prices are actually quite steep!  It was a satisfying dinner but I'm sure better value can be found.  I'd recommend a non-noodle dish for sure."}
{"text":"Pick Thai is absolutely the best!! This chef knows what she is doing. This is my favourite food ever! Green curry. This is 100 percent; without a doubt; hands down ... the best of the best Thai food in this city ... in this province ... in the entire Occident. You'd have to go so far West, young man, that you will have had reached the East once again. You'd have to travel far and wide to get close to the excellence and authenticity of this Thai green curry. Ask to speak to the boss lady ... ask her to make you the same vegetarian Thai green curry that she makes for Raj ... that's me. My green curry is especially made for me and it is 100% strictly vegetarian. You won't find this elsewhere. Voilà, the sublime excellence, nuance and harmony of Thai flavour. 

Have you heard of the King of Siam? Well this is the story of the King and I ... whilst monarchic tradition and hegemony, in my humble opinion, begets a most anachronistic and antiquated and deleterious convention of social inequity, popular subservience, enslavement of the intellect, royal incest and unwarranted elitist hegemony ... notwithstanding all that ... sometimes the people just want you to rule them with an iron fisted donkey punch to the kidneys. Does it make sense that people would disregard their seething sectarian hatred for one another in order to unite in love, harmony and servility - all the way down in the dirt - beneath some arbitrary monarch? They barely have food and water but what they really need is pomp and circumstance and royal pageantry. So, basically, take a country where there is a lot of civil unrest based on ethnic, linguistic and / or religious differences and just establish a monarchy. That should solve all the problems in the entire world. Yes, indeed, the penultimate solution is to unify people with all of their hatred for one another by somehow galvanising their allegiance and support and loyalty in one lofty, unelected, unaccountable and arbitrary megalomaniac of a person, in relation to whom, they should all feel inferior. They would need to obey and love this monarch who would tell them all what they can and cannot do and how and how not to think. C'mon Rama IX, that is a bit amateurish ... not very fly for a Thai guy. 

I love you, Red Shirts! SOCIALISM!

Monarchism precipitates the need for the subjects being ruled over; to, in effect, maintain an individual and societal state of suspended disbelief. Disbelief in the primacy of the individual in relation to the welfare of society, disbelief in one's individual agency and authority, disbelief in the equality of all people and disbelief in good governance, true democracy, accountability and transparency. 

Monarchism perpetuates old anachronisms such as the concept of race and the idea that one ethnicity can be superior to another ethnicity and therefore those born to this royal family or that royal family are naturally born to rule over the obviously inferior masses. It perpetuates classism; in our modern society one should not be expected to defer to another or hold another above oneself simply because of birth. It perpetuates discrimination based bullshit; most of us cannot become King or Queen of Canada. It also perpetuates discrimination based on gender in the case of male primogeniture. Fuck that shit! I'm all about the VOX POPULI!! Let's hear it for equality, folks. 

Monarchy makes it impossible to separate church & state as the monarch is usually both head of state and head of the church. Sometimes the monarch is a god or demigod. Isn't Queen Elisabeth like Jesus' second cousin or something? Wait would that make her also her own father? Talk about incest! The Emperor of Japan is like a Shinto God. The King of Thailand is like an incarnation of the Hindu avatar Rama! What? 

Monarchism is also problematic for the monarchs themselves what with all the incest and hemophilia. They also have a hard time (poor little rich kid) growing up, what with the dysfunctional household and obvious abnormal childhood. 

Monarchism is also very expensive and modern monarchy remains unaccountable to taxpayers. Britons pay over £100 million per annum and that number may not even be the \"real McCoy\" as the finances are exempt from the Access to Information Act. Canada spends about 250$ million each year; not including our annual gifting to the crown of twenty purebred horses from the RCMP. Each horse costs about a cool 20 million each. 

As long as people remain subjects of a monarch and not citizens of a republic their political and social attitudes will inevitably retain a certain mediaeval idiocy which has no place in modernity. 

Ultimately, monarchy (the monarch, monarchism and the institution) makes the country which they rule over appear backwards and ill suited for a just society that ostensibly is conducive to a secular, multicultural, and multilingual civil state. 

Off with their figurative heads. Get it? Figure head? Go figure ... it's all about the economy, stupid"}
{"text":"We finally tried after reading LC's great review and did not disappoint. Lovely decor and attentive service. Food is very tasty and fresh. Best dishes we had were: eggplant salad, filet mignon salad, green curry.  Nice selection of appetizers - rolls, satays, fried salmon bites - which the kids really enjoyed. Pad Thai was also quite lovely. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was incredibly high quality Thai food. I was a little apprehensive at first when I saw the building that this restaurant was in, but the interior is beautifully decorated. The prices are relatively high for Thai food, but so is the quality. My food was uniformly delicious. They served a coconut milk and lemongrass soup that was fantastic. It tasted unlike anything I had before. My chicken in peanut sauce was great. There was also an appetizer that was salmon wrapped in dough and fried that was incredible."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place; today my mom and I are walking by, and we decided to go there for lunch. 

Nice greetings from our host. 

I was awed by the restaurant's decor. Lots of statues of Buddhas, in gold in every corner. I never described such things in my review, I love the design of their water glass. It's a tall glass, called Vizner. We were served with Lemon water, very refreshing. 

We ordered from the lunch menu, we had mango salad and vegetable spring rolls with plum sauce. The taste was flawless.

Then my mom got the shrimp pad Thai and I got Chicken fried rice. Both dishes were cooked perfectly. 

We ended our meal with nice cup of coffee. 

This place is beautifully decorated. The service is amiable and quick. The savor of the food was amazing. A perfect place for lunch and supper.

My mom believes that this restaurant is perfect spot to host a small wedding or any other celebration"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fantastic service, beautiful decor and authentic and creative dishes"}
{"text":"I had the occasion to have an office lunch here. Their lunch menu was limited but had enough choices. In any case, most people at my table took and enjoyed their pad thai which was served with a lot of thinly sliced vegetables (first time I see that). I had the cashew shimps in a sweet and sour sauce. It was just an okay dish for me, it didn't particularly stand out. The decor is nice and intimate so it could be a nice place for a date."}
{"text":"Visitando el cielo con el paladar... Con escala en Thailandia... OMG que comida !!!   la combinación de sabores es única además si eres mexicano te va a fascinar pica diferente con otro sazón si vienes a Montreal no lo dejes de visitar !!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a family dinner last Saturday night about ten people and everyone loved their food. They offered us a special for $35 per person and they brought out many gorgeous dishes for us to share including spring rolls and soup. My favourite was the crunchy noodles with vegetables and the tofu curry. Everything was amazing though. 

The decor was modern and the atmosphere cozy. It wasn't too loud which was so nice because we didn't have to yell to talk to each other. It's probably because it wasn't too crowded but also because the rooms are divided in two and the acoustics are good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Pick Thai. I've been twice, and both times enjoyed their table d'hote menu. It's really worth it! 

The last time I visited, I ordered the chicken pad thai table d'hote, which came with 2 appetizers before the main! I always get 1/2 the main to go since the appetizers are delicious and worth filling up on. 

With this menu, you get a mango salad and a spring vegetable roll. This is followed by a tom yum soup (on the spicy side), and 3 fried appetizers. Yummy everything tastes amazing!! The restaurant is very pretty with a chill ambiance. Perfect for date night or a quiet conversation.

The waitress was a little slow and made weird comments which wasn't great hence I docked off 1 star. I would return!"}
{"text":"Decor is impressive. But that's the only thing that's impressive. :(
Got the pad lanaa, was basically a bed of buffet soup garnish noodles topped with a mix of vegetables that they use for every dish. My friend got the green curry, and the vegetables were the same. Evidently, they don't put much passion in their food. Overall, food was sub par but if you needed to eat... it shouldn't be a problem. I guess maybe I just came here with high expectations.
Also, lunchtime service was slow, but courteous."}
{"text":"The price is a little expensive, but their food is very tasty. I wanted to find a Thai restaurant who have curry crab on that day, but they don't have. So I tried one dish with fried shrimp and my husband had salmon. They add some Thai spices, which made the food very tasty. And their amount of dish is just good, which is perfect for dinner."}
{"text":"Relatively bland for Thai food. They charged $5 to add shrimp to our Pad Thai, but only 3 shrimp were added to the dish. Only one small portion of rice was included with our large takeout order. I will not order from them again."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with Pick Thai! The best Pad Thai I've ever had, ever! Everything is so fresh and you can taste the quality ingredients. Have the dessert before you leave, the banana fritters and the Thai pancake are to die for!! Even people who don't really like dessert are going to LOVE their desserts. It's a little expensive but it's worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"I took the opportunity of having to plan a friend's birthday dinner in NDG to finally get to try Pick Thai. I reserved via Yelp message and was replied to within minutes, which is so reassuring when you're booking for a group. 

Our group ordered a couple different dishes to share - the mango salad was to die for, and the imperial rolls were fresh and light to start. The gluten free pad thai was delish, loved the flavours, to me they were just as they should be, tart and yummy and the tofu and egg were well cooked. My friends loved the peanut chicken, and chicken green curry - I tasted the sauces and enjoyed for sure - and we all enjoyed the veggie pad sieu. We felt healthy and well fed and well cared for by the end, and the lovely room was perfect for a birthday. Service was warm, prompt, kind, and impeccably timed without being hurried. 

Loved it and most importantly so did the birthday girl!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at Pick Thai while in Montreal last week.  Service and food were awesome. We had the Seafood Soup, Chicken Pad Thai and Mango Rice desert. Best Thai we have ever eaten.  Will eat here again when we get back to Montreal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! Beautiful and cozy decor! This restaurant was recommended last year by a colleague of mine and I'm so happy that I finally visited. Absolutely must try! 

I would start with the salads, oh the salads! The papaya and green mango salads are delicious and of very good size! I got scared by the statement of our host that the hot version of the papaya salad is burning and ordered it mild, fortunately it was still hot enough to be considered authentic. The dried shrimp added an extra flavour I'm still dreaming about.

The mains can be ordered with vegetables or different choices of meat and fish. The Pad Thai was delicious, it is served with a small set of soya sauce, authentic red chilly paste and ground peanuts, so you can flavour it up to your taste. I had the creamy green curry with scallops, it was so good that I ate some of the creamy sauce with my spoon, I could have easily chosen the vegetarian version of the dish as it was really filling. The very classical Thai dessert coconut sticky rice with mango is served with wild black rice, another point for the chef. 

I'm also impressed with the wine list. I have to admit I did not spend too much time to look at the reds, because the whites were so well chosen to match the food, selection of reislings, gewürztraminer etc. The owners have invested time in perfect wine paring options for their customers. 

My dinner visit was on Easter Sunday and the restaurant was not packed at all. I made a reservation using the Yelp booking service for the first time and I guess it is better to book in advance just in case. With or without a reservation I'm coming back for more coconut curry! Yum!"}
{"text":"The menu states what items can be gluten-free.  awesome!  I ordered a \"gluten-free\" noodle dish and then spent all night throwing up. I don't think it was gluten-free.  Really a shame because the restaurant is beautiful (classy and comfortable - not too \"fancy\" and not tacky) and I really liked the food (on the way down, not on the way up).  Please be careful here if you have dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"To be fair I will start off with saying we picked up, maybe that made a difference. The soups were very good, just the right amount of spice and filled with goodness. But that was the only good thing. The pad Thai was like past and blah!! The red curry chicken was barely ok and expensive for what you got. Would never eat their food again"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. The food was excellent! Authentic Thai. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Large selection of dishes. Average portion sizes with lots of vegetables (but not too much meat). Quick service, friendly personnel. Nice decor. Above average prices. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Decent food but terrible service! I waited 20 mins to get a menu. I went alone and the server asked me to go sit by the window when everyone else were escorted with a menu. I had to wait for a menu. Food wasn't hot, it was warm, it lacks flavor."}
{"text":"This place is further out from the main area in Montreal, but it's pretty good Thai food. The restaurant is very nice with excellent decor, makes it a somewhat classy meal (depending on who you're with!) The portions were big - between four girls we had an appetizer and two entrees and we all were full. It is on the pricier side, but that might be because Thai food in NY is always on the cheaper side. Anyway, if you're looking for thai in this area, I'd definitely go to this place."}
{"text":"The food is good and the portion is generous. I recommend to everyone. One of the best choice for Thai food in Montreal. I recommend to ordering the tasting menu.

Beware, you won't finish your meal. Two salads and appetizers plus soup are a lot (the tom yum soup was delicious!). I could not finish my main dish."}
{"text":"Lovely decor, very friendly waiters. The food is great. Perfect place to eat if you are in the area or looking for a nice place to have dinner without breaking the bank. They are closed between 2 and 5pm.

I came back recently for lunch and had a pad kapao that was excessively salty. I remembered the pad thai was much better last time I was here."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our supper at Pick Thai. The ambience was really nice and cozy and the service was excellent. The food came quickly and they checked in on us a couple of times to see if everything was too our liking. We ordered #1,3 and 4 from the appetizers. The spring rolls, fried shrimp and little chicken rolls were delicious!! We also ordered the mango salad which was really light and refreshing! We then shared the chicken green curry which was just spicy enough and the shrimp pad Thai, which was excellent! They were very generous with the shrimp. We didn't find the portions small like some reviews said. The portions are made so that  you can try different dishes. Overall we loved our experience and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this restaurant is not famous. 
Amazing place for freinds, family and business as well. Here has a luxurious-oriental atmosphere with a reasonable price. 

My favorite dish is the eggplant salad. U should try it! :))"}
{"text":"Fancy decoration but kind of cold for me .. food is good but not wow, good service and no chopsticks and no free tea...."}
