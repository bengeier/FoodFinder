{"text":"BEST CREPES EVER! Had just about every crepe on the menu. The crepes are very thin and the ingredients are always fresh. Best part is that it's made to order and you can see your meal being prepared in front of you.  They also have amazing coffee and some of the best loose leaf tea I've ever had. The lattes will keep you coming back day after day, and I love their mago and peach tea which are also individually brewed and can be hot or over iced. I love mine iced especially on a hot day. Also the owner are some of the nicest people, always make you feel like fily. Thumbs uppppp all the way!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat and I enjoy very much coming during my Lunch or dinner hour. The crepes are made fresh  and filled with a fresh and generous portion of adders. My favorite adders: black beans, sauté mushrooms and fresh spinach.  Love the cozy atmosphere and friendliness of the owners."}
{"text":"Well, what a disappointment. Darn it! I love crepes, and with all the great reviews I was very excited to try. My husband ordered the Hamazing.....which was Hanotsomuch. He asked for light on lettuce. It still came with so much lettuce, he had to take some out. The bulk of the crepe, apparently, is lettuce. Without it, he was left with a slice of \"lunchmeat\" ham, a slice of cheese, and a small amount of mushrooms. I ordered the Mediterranean. I've never tasted sour and bland at the same time. The pesto tasted like straight mustard. The chicken seemed to be boiled? However it was prepared, it was NOT prepared with any seasoning. Quite simply, it was pretty awful. I had 4 bites and couldn't eat any more of it. At just under $10 a pop, a true waste of my money. Although we will not be returning for an entree crepe, I am holding out hope for the desert crepes."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough.  The staff are very helpful and great service, if you have not been there they are happy to help you chose a crepe for your first time. I tried the Florentine with added Ham, it was so good.  The crepes are the best i have had from anywhere in the US. They are perfectly cooked and taste so good, i recommend coming here. The coffee was good too and have a wide selection of teas. I can't think of a better thing to have with a good crepe than a nice cup of coffee.  Definitely try this place, its in the center of Matthews and definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Had the strawberry short cake crepe and it was delish!! The owner was very friendly. Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Price is very reasonable, about $20 for two crepes and a large coffee. The two women working were also very kind, the restaurant resembles a coffee house rather than a traditional sit down location, so it was nice to see them walking around and asking how our meal was. As for the food, it was good and filling which was also very nice. You never have a problem with biting in and having a full mouth of only tomato or cheese. Over all, 5/5 will come back again."}
{"text":"A  locally owned cafe with great food and friendly personal service. A real winner in my book!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious & the service is amazing!!!! Every time I have visited this establishment the owner makes us feel so welcome :) I came near closing time one night & she still had the same care & concern for our meal & was just so happy to see us. My daughter told her how much she loves honey & the owner gave her a little jar as a gift. The loose leaf tea service is always a treat for me & my daughter. I absolutely love coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the culture of this place!! The music, the accents, the coffee...really a great experience. You can order your crepe and have it delivered next door to the Beer Temple as well- perfect! Elaina, the owner, is such a sweetheart and goes out of her way to ensure her customers are happy.  Cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, Fresh coffee and amazing owners who make you feel at home! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great service, great coffee, and fantastic fresh crepes! We had florentine and el rancho."}
{"text":"cute place, good service and food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at a reasonable price. We over 7 Crepes for 7 people - and everyone ended up splitting and sharing because they were just so huge and delicious. WE WILL COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Second visit here and i have to say i am really warming up to the idea of dessert dinner/dessert breakfast. Came in this evening for the wife to fix a craving for nutella. decided to try a loose leaf tea. Moroccan Mint Green tea is AWESOME!. it was a little warm, so id be cautious of entering the place when the temp goes above 80 outside, but well see. Looking forward to trying a blackbean and egg/avocado tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty crepes. The owner was just so lovely and attentive while explaining the menu to us. Both the sweet and savory crepes are worth the trip to this quaint little creperie for sure."}
{"text":"This place is about as perfect a place as you could wish for.  The crepes are delicious, and there are so many varieties.  Plus, there is a huge variety of coffees, prepared with precision.  It the food and coffee weren't enough, the owner is welcoming and warm.  You can feel the love the entire staff puts into everything they do.  Great customer service highlights an always outstanding eating/drinking experience."}
{"text":"Great crepes & really love that they will deliver to Carolina Beer Temple next door!  The crepes are thin but very tasty! There's also a very good variety of crepes to choose from."}
{"text":"So good. Wish they were open more without the break in the afternoon. My only complaint is that I want more of it. =) The gluten free crepes are amazing."}
{"text":"Great food! Very casual, fun little spot. They make the crepes right in front of you. Definitely would recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Crepe was excellent; however, the filing ingredients felt like they were canned and not of the best quality.  We tried lunch type crepes.  We'll try the desert crepes next time.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious, light and airy crepes. Two of us split a savory and a dessert crepe, and the portions were perfect. The shop reminds me of an old time soda shop. Outside seating is small and shady."}
{"text":"Good crepes.  Good coffee.  Friendly service.  Large selection of crepes, gourmet coffee, and tea. Explore the menu."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The house blend coffee is locally roasted and fresh. I had the Royal Trinity dessert crepe for brunch and it hit the spot! To top it all off, the customer service was excellent. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"OMG.  We just discovered this place this week and have returned 3 times -- tonight for dinner. Great coffee. Incredible food. It is a culinary experience.  Disagree with the negative comment about price.  It's a phenomenal VALUE.   Nothing like it in Matthews. Wish we had found it earlier in the summer.   Customer service is top notch.  Family-owned and operated.  Makes all the difference.  Since first writing this,we've been back several times.   Always consistent.   Hot breakfast today.   Another awesome experience."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!!! The owner is extremely nice and helpful. I enjoyed my tea and strawberry Cheesecake!! I found my new spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food, tasty coffee and friendly owners who make you feel right at home.  This place has been open 1 week and they're off to a great start. Derek and his wife were so friendly and open to feedback about the food and the experience.  My breakfast crepe with turkey, tomato and avocado was terrific.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ate there with my fiancé tonight and the food was amazing!  We also saw that they will walk their food right next door to the beer place!"}
{"text":"This place has the best crêpes in town.  They have a wide variety of different crepes and coffee to chose from. Everyone is so kind and friendly there.  Great location. Wish I lived closer so I could walk there every day."}
{"text":"Amazing little find in downtown Matthews. I traveled 2,100 miles to visit family and found this jewel with fantastic crepes and terrific service! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and helpful! Very wide variety of crepes and you can create your own. The tea is amazing as well as coffee. The food is very delicious, differently coming back!"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience and very accommodating to food allergies. Favorite is the Hamazing."}
{"text":"Great location in the heart of Matthews. I frequent this spot and attempt to try a new crepe every time. The seasonal options are so yummy. Elena and Alex are great people, just ask them for a recommendation and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Perfect little cozy family owned place where you'll not only love the fresh ingredients but appreciate the families story. Be sure to meet them while you're enjoying a hidden local gem in the quaint town of Matthews NC."}
{"text":"Super fresh crepes in a Subway-style setting (you order the crepe additions as you go along if you want to). They have both sweet and savory. I had the turkey and veggie which was HUGE. You wouldn't look at the order of 1 crepe, no sides as being a big enough meal but the crepe has so much meat and so many fresh veggies cooked to order that I finished a quarter of it. My son had the Nutella crepes which were very good. He makes these at home all the time so he is somewhat of an aficionado. The Peanut Butter and Banana sounded lovely but, alas, too much sugar.  The owners are very chatty and open about the business. I always ask new businesses how its going; we don't want to get attached to a new place if they'll get shuttered in a month.  This can be a bakery-level treat or a healthy breakfast so mixed groups are best. Especially wonderful for the no carbers as the crepe is about a micron think. It is a tiny spot so go off-times. We were there at 10 and had one other group. It cost around $8 each for the heavy duty meat, veggie and cheese HUGE, fresh crepe. A good deal, indeed."}
{"text":"Going by the Yelp reviews we decided to try this place out. We split the Italian Job and a Strawberries & Cream crepe... They were both amazing. Crepes were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of fillings.  They are also big enough to split, especially if you want to have a savory and sweet one. Their teas are very good too.  Went back a second time and still has good has the first time. A+ for consistency.   I want to add the customer service is excellent which is always appreciated if not expected."}
{"text":"Wow! I am wholly impressed with Royal Cafe & Creperie, and they just opened two and a half months ago!  It might sound crazy, but I have never had a good crepe until today. I needed some breakfast, and I came across this new place. After seeing the high Yelp scores, I decided to stop in.   I ordered the Crepe Florentine, and it was fantastic. The crepe was done to perfection, and the fillings were very fresh. It contained the perfect balance of cheese, onion, spinach and mushroom.   To my delight, Royal Cafe serves tea from TeaRex. I wish more restaurants in Charlotte could and would partner with TeaRex. When restaurants serve high quality tea, especially from local purveyors, I know they truly care about the food they serve. I ordered my favorite, Earl Grey.  The woman who helped me today appears to be one of the owners. She was very friendly and helpful to this first-time visitor. She extended her positive greeting to all who visited while I dined.  I know the place is still new, but I wish to make two suggestions for improvement.   1. The paper plates and plastic utensils just don't jibe with the rest of the experience presented at Royal Cafe. The food is so good and of such high quality, it feels a little odd to be eating it on paper plates. Perhaps one day they'll upgrade.  2. Royal Cafe is guilty of one of my big brick & mortar no-no's. They had a live radio station playing over the sound system in the restaurant. This is one of my biggest pet-peeves. Poor music choice is distracting enough as it is, but to add in advertisements and chatter is so wrong. I hope it's something they will consider changing in the very near future. They've shown so much attention to detail and quality through the decor, service, and food; they need to extend it to the in-house music (and the plates).  ^ Incidentally, I am so enamored with this place, I just can't deduct a star for either of these. The rest of it was absolutely perfect. I highly recommend Royal Cafe & Creperie!"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes! Had phillie cheesesteak, roast beast, strawberry shortcake & caramel apple. All delicious! We will be back, SOON!"}
{"text":"good food. freshly made. wayyy too expensive and took far too long at weekend brunch. not many tables so plan on takeout or going at off hours."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and it's made right in front of you, so you know how clean the kitchen is.  There are a lot of choices of different crepes you can order and if you don't like any of the combos that are listed on the menu, you can make your own crepe.  I got a breakfast crepe with avocados - I forget the name on the menu and it was delicious.  My only complaint was that it was so big, I couldn't finish it and crepes don't hold up well so I had to throw out the leftovers.  The prices are pretty steep for crepes IMO, but I guess that's why they are so big.  If I go back, I will make sure to split my crepe next time."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, coffee, and tea and a friendly and caring owner. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the crepes are always delicious and they have a huge selection of loose leaf teas that you can choose from. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly,  so fast for quick pick up. Much better though if you eat there!  Best dirty Chai around!"}
{"text":"Wow! Crepes, crepes and more crepes.  This was our first time here. I wanted something different,  light,  and breakfasty. The owner provided a run down of their food,  coffees and teas (32 different flavors!)   We ordered the Greek Isles (egg, feta cheese, spinach,  sauteed mushrooms,  onions and kalamata olives)  and the Gyro (gyro meat,  feta cheese,  tomato,  onions,  banana peppers,  and tzatziki sauce). The Greek was a little dry but tasty.  The gyro was a super winner and will be the one I get next time we visit.    The whole time we were there,  the place had a consistent stream of people,  including the kiddos. The dessert crepes were definitely winners with them.  One of the cool things here is that you can watch them create crepe masterpieces.   Friendly staff and delicious food. If you are looking for something different and on the lighter side,  this place is perfect.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday morning, after visiting the Matthews Farmer's Market. The ladies working were very pleasant and efficient. The food was good, but my husband and I both felt the crepes lacked flavor. I ordered an iced tea to go, and it also had very little flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, friendly staff, great crepes.  The coffee is fresh and local, the teas are diverse and delicious."}
{"text":"Our first visit. We came in for breakfast and were very happy with the experience. The staff is efficient and friendly. The food was fresh and well prepared. Next time we go back it will be for desert."}
{"text":"I visited Royal Cafe and Creperie for the first time today at lunch.  There's about 7 or 8 tables inside and 2 or 3 tables outside.  All the tables were full, except for one, when we walked in.  You place your order at the counter then sit down. There is a varied selection of breakfast, lunch and dessert crepes.  There is also a gluten free option.  I had the 3 Omegas crepe, filled with spinach, black beans, avocado, onion, walnuts, feta and basil pesto. It was delicious!  My husband and I split the S'more dessert crepe, chocolate chunks, broken graham crackers, lots of mini marshmallows, topped with powered sugar and drizzled with chocolate.  Warm, gooey and  yummy!  We enjoyed our visit with Elena, one of the owners.  Her joy and passion for what she does is evident.  Already looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I got the one with strawberries bananas and chocolate drizzle with the Nutella and whipped cream and it is the best crepe I have ever had! I highly recommend you try this place the people who work here are so nice and you can even watch them make the crepes m! Love it!"}
{"text":"Just amazing!!! So friendly!!! Gluten free and vegan options! Savory and sweet crepes! Loose teas, special coffees! I cannot day enough great things about this shop!"}
{"text":"Super yummy.  Neighborhood gem.  Staff was so excited to help us determine the best selection for us.  Will definitely frequent this spot again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the third time i have come and each time i experience a very welcoming atmosphere with friendly staff who are always eager to help. Even when you accidentally order a peach tea rather than a peach smoothie haha. They switched it out for me without an issue. Bur to be more serious, if you want to eat somewhere that is health friendly with their menu and able to cater to most tastes then this is the place to go. They even have the option for creating your own personal style crepe or adjusting one of the original crepe options to fit your interests. This place is great!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite desert places in Matthews, the owner is very very helpful!! Dish is Delicious, definitely coming back !!!"}
{"text":"I just had the barvarian crepe. I thought it was terrible and tasted rubbery. The strawberries tastes old like they had been sitting in the juice way to long which gave a strange mushy  taste. The barvarian cream was just ok. Definitely not worth 9+. I would never go again..."}
{"text":"Good little cafe in Matthews. I tried the Greek breakfast crepe--egg, feta, olives, spinach--very tasty and healthy. I think the flavor is good but a little dry. I could have used a sauce or more butter. The crepe batter was nice and crisp. I liked the fresh spinach too. Their coffee drinks are a wide variety--I tried the pumpkin spice latte with almond milk. It was yummy and delicious. We had brunch and it was busy so I would go early.  Parking on a Sunday was packed and I chose to park by the library and walk."}
{"text":"My first visit from a recommendation did not disappoint food wise. I was there during a slow time with only 2 other people eating. My crepe came out fresh and very tasty. The tea was also a surprise. Very earthy tasting, delicious!   The owner was very polite but one little thing bothered me. She walked past my table several times without offering my EMPTY cup a refill. I gave her 3 chances and even shook my cup of ice slightly for a little hint. But nothing registered in her brain that i needed a refill. I still had half a crepe to go so I needed some liquid. She seemed clueless as to my refill needs so I finally spoke up. For that reason alone, I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"We came here one day after opening day - we were so excited to have a creperie nearby!  Our excitement was not disappointed: The experience was great in every way.  The crepes are delicious, and really big and stuffed with lots of good food. Substitutions are no problem. Prices are more than reasonable (6-7 dollars for a crepe). We tried a breakfast crepe, a savory crepe and a sweet crepe, and I can recommend them all. Delicious Nutella makes the dessert crepes all the better!  We talked to the owners a bit - it sounds like as soon as the farmers market in Matthews opens up again, they want to source as many of their ingredients as possible from over there. Great idea!!   They also make great coffee (locally roasted and tasty) and tea (loose leaf).  One downside: Everything was served on paper plates and in paper cups. They explained that the place is small and they were planning to mostly cater to the take-out crowd, but I would enjoy eating there even more on a real plate when I am not creating a pile of trash with one meal. That would also go better with the idea of sourcing your ingredients locally...   Update: There are now real coffee cups! Thanks Royal Cafe for listening to what customers have to say, awesome! :)  Bottom line: I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small & quaint. The owners are so friendly! Ad every crepe I've had has been delicious! My favorite is the gryo crepe. I add avocado to it & it's to die for. The strawberry & nutella crepe is awesome as well. I've been several times & it's now one of my go-to places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for breakfast one morning and fell in love. The women that work there are so sweet and we could tell that they loved what they did! The food was delicious! We shared a more savory one and a sweet one and both were to die for! If you haven't stopped by this place yet you definitely should!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Been here a few time now and each time I've ordered something different and everything has been delicious! You can make a crepe any way you like it or pick from the menu. Whether breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert you will not be disappointed. Very friendly staff and sociable.  They will take your order including the dessert crepe but hold off on making it until you are finishing up your meal. It saves from having to get back in line to order it or from getting funky sitting there waiting to be eaten.  They also have their own coffees they make and long list of specialty teas. They are fabulous!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"OMG...the crepes are awesome!!!  All the ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere is casual and the customer service is very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place, can't wait to go back! Very fresh and clean tasting food. Great service, excellent coffee."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff combined with incredible food and coffee makes this place a \"One of a Kind\" spot for a great meal. Outstanding Cafe."}
{"text":"Wow! When I think of crepes I think of fruit and syrup and the like - I don't think of eggs and stuff folded into a crepe. I had the 8am, which is eggs, sausage, cheese, peppers and onion folded into a crepe. It was delish! I had a simple coffee, which was good, but next time I'll try the specialty coffees, of which they have plenty Also, when I come back I'll have to try some of sweet crepes too!"}
{"text":"I visited Royal Cafe & Creperie for the first time last week on Thursday. they have a Buffalo Chicken Special that I took advantage of; it was awesome. The staff were helpful, friendly. The place is clean and in a cool location. I came with with work buddies and then headed up the street to the Carolina Beet Temple where we were able to get a delicious craft beer to have with the awesome crepe."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 3 mainly because of the price. 3 crepes and three drinks, 1 being a water, came to $31 for lunch. EEEEK!!!!!  I had the Mediterranean crepe. It consisted of cubed chix, roasted red peppers, banana peppers cheese and some other salty items. It was not very good. Because the chicken was cubed, it kept falling out of the crepe and the salty, pickled items overpowered the entire crepe.   My son got the Gyro crepe. It was very tasty but it was also obvious that the Gyro meat was originally frozen. Still the overall taste was really good. My son loved it and when it comes down to it, that's all that matters.  My daughter had the strawberries, Nutella and whipped cream crepe. Yes I know, I allowed her to have a dessert crepe for lunch, don't judge! This crepe was my favorite. Aside from the mess, the crepe was beyond delicious. Lots of strawberries, lots of Nutella and lots of whipped cream. It was definitely the favorite among all of us at the table.  The atmosphere was fine and they offer free WiFi which is very nice."}
{"text":"Today we walked in, after a great dinner and picked up some amazing desert and coffee. Elena (the owner) was soo welcoming and walked us through the menu. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and crepes.   Many other things on the menu.   We had the banana foster crep and it was awesome.   Definitely worth stopping into if in the area"}
{"text":"I am so sad. I love crepes and this place is a couple miles from my house. I really wanted to love it here so I could stop trekking uptown for hazelnuts. I got here at 4:15 pm without realizing that they are closed from 3-5pm on weekdays. I decided to wait 45 mins in the car even though I was starving because I was really craving a crepe.  I got the chicken cordon bleu crepe. The crepe part was not crispy or hot. It was lukewarm and super doughy/soggy. They put such little cheese in it I couldn't even tell there was any in there (maybe they forgot the cheese?). The bacon was one of those precooked strips but it seemed like it wasn't microwaved because it was cold. They didn't even crumble it but just put one whole strip in there. 90% of what was in there was a bunch of iceberg lettuce that didn't seem fresh. Almost no chicken and that too wasn't warm. They were sub par and honestly I threw most of it away. Maybe they just had an off day because all of the other reviews are flawless. Unfortunately, my experience was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Great food! I got the Florentine and my husband got the turkey and cheddar.  Also they have real tea! The hot tea selection was great and the coffee was good too.  Worth the trip and will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a crepe kind of guy but this place . . . They do three things, crepes, coffee and tea and they do them all very VERY well. They have a variety of crepes suitable for any time of day not just breakfast so feel free to go by for lunch or dinner. Or if you don't like what they've put together you can 'make' your own from a list of ingredients. Their coffee is local, oh so good.and totally refillable. They have a variety of loose leaf teas and serve them in those bottom pouring tea pots. The inside is very pleasant nicely done but not over done and the service is just excellent. Yes they serve the crepes on paper plates (sturdy ones) which is a little odd but they do have metal flatware so it's just not that big a deal. Go get your crepe on, seriously they're awesome."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict, Philly cheesesteak crepes were delicious! The cappuccino and lattés as well! However, they need to monitor seating and keep non-customers and customers from parking their ass at a table and waiting for the rest of their party!!! It sucks to stand there with food in hand watching people occupy a table, surf on their phones while waiting on the rest of their party!"}
{"text":"Had a tasty Chai here. Large, open space. Not too loud when I visited on a weekday morning"}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte from STL, MO. Everything about this place was outstanding. The food was to die for...chunky monkey, royal trinity and caramel apple pie.   The house coffee was very good. The owners were very friendly and very accommodating. A tad pricey but worth it. The Chinet plates did not bother me in the slightest.  I cannot wait to go back.  A+"}
{"text":"Let me start with the not-so-good...this place is small. They need to knock down walls and expand,...into the street if they have to! They already have outdoor seating so why not just make it a daily block party!  Now for all of the AMAZING things about this place...first, the Elaina (praying I spelled her name correctly) is so wonderful. She just carries on conversations like no one is in there but you. And when I was next in line, I wondered why she was small-talking the person in front of me for so long, but when it was my turn...we just talked and talked and I didn't mind, Ha! Seriously, she really is a wonderful individual. She made recommendations and praised her daughter to the point I asked who she was so I could meet her.   The crepes are nothing short of amazing as well. My Love ordered the florentine crepe and added chicken, and I built my own crepe with steak, egg whites, spinach, onions, chipotle aioli and goat cheese because I've been having a love affair with goat cheese lately and I put it on EVERYTHING! The crepes were beyond delicious and fresh and just plain YUMMY! We shared a sweet crepe with strawberries, bananas and Nutella...a winning combination. And from the reviews, we had to have the coffee. I had an Irish Cream latte and he had a mocha latte.  We have found another GREAT Creperie in the Charlotte area. We shall return often!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Yes, it's different & interesting to get crepes, but this isn't worth it.  My Tiramiso crepe was bland, & my husbands Philly steak & cheese was unremarkable as well.  About $20 & we now need to go find food.  Can't recommend."}
{"text":"Omg so good! They have both savory and dessert crepes. I had the Mediterranean crepe and the pumpkin spice crepe with jasmine plum loose leaf tea. Both crepes were full of flavor and were not greasy at all. The restaurant itself is very clean and everything is neatly organized. Service was excellent and it was nice to speak Russian with the employees there. I would highly recommend this place for any time of the day."}
{"text":"Great creperie that I've found while spending a night in town. Very delicious, great selection of teas as well. This came pretty close to some of the best crepes I had in Montreal a few years ago.  While I really loved the bottom dispensing tea pot the tea was offered in. I was a bit surprised by paper plates and plastic forks. Not environmentally friendly at all and not classy. Please invest in some shatter proof plates and silverware."}
{"text":"Cold soggy crepes are not tasty at all. I was very disappointed after reading all of the reviews about this place. I'd rather travel to downtown Charlotte for a good crepe. At least the coffee and tea were good and the owners very welcoming."}
{"text":"Very good, went on a Friday night. We each had dinner (meat) crepes and shared a dessert (strawberry shortcake) crepe. Will come back with the boys so they can try them out. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I like to indulge in what can only be described as \"hella white people food.\" And the other day was no different; I laced up my navy blue Keds, slapped on the ole calculator watch, and listened to 70s hair metal in my Buick hybrid all the way to Royal.  The crepes were delicious (as always), service was fast, and I thoroughly appreciate restaurants that serve pop in cans instead of the fountain. They're closed on Mondays which is a bummer but other than that, a top quality experience every time I go in."}
{"text":"Yummy banana and peanut butter crepe.   I would get two since one wasn't filling enough but there are so many to try, that won't be a problem next time.  They have coffee and a wide variety of teas."}
{"text":"Again, we are regulars here. They have delicious creations, incredibly friendly and attentive. They learned our names, ask about our children & work.    It's a terrific place. Great food. Great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Crepes are amazing and fresh and there are so many options to choose from! I'm also a big fan of their lattes. Customer service was great! This is one of my favorite places in Matthews!"}
{"text":"So good!  Unlike some  of the other crepe places around, pretty much all they serve here is crepes and they do it very well.  My favorite is the cord-en-blue but their dessert crepes are wonderful as well.  What I wasn't expecting was how impressive their coffees and teas are.  I think they give most coffee shops a run for their money."}
{"text":"Fun and tasty cafe in the heart of downtown Matthews. A great spot for breakfast, brunch and lunch. The menu has incredible variety and the food is of great quality. My only complaints are the price and the paper plates. If you are going to charge upwards of $9 for a crepe at least add some fruit as a side. The pricing and the name of the cafe should also correspond with real plates. Paper plates might work for a food truck, but not a place described as royal."}
{"text":"We didn't get to taste the crepes since we were meeting friends for breakfast later, but they looked superb.   The coffee selection is great and the coffees exquisitely prepared.   And the Samba in the background doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Great crepes.  Both my friend and I enjoyed our crepes.  I had a breakfast crepe for dinner could have used a little more egg,and filling, but still good.  We shared the strawberry and graham crackers crepe and that was yummmm.  The owner is very nice and friendly, which is great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on another dessert run within 30 minutes after coming from Artisen and we were greeted with smiles! The owner was so incredibly sweet and was telling us about the background of the place and where she came from, super genuine! They have a HUGE selection of tea and I didn't get to try any when I first went so I definitely need to come back and try that. We got the Bavarian Crepe, as recommended by her and I liked it! The crepe itself was chewy and had a very good flavor. The strawberries and the light cream really toned down the sweetness from the rest of the syrup that was drizzled on top. I do want to try their other savory options as well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint place clean and friendly in a nice area The food is made to order and doesn't take long. The staff is friendly and look sharp and clean Elena the owner greets you and has conversations with you. Healthy foods and pretty much makes what you want if not on the menu. Very accommodating. They also have lots of teas and coffeeWill come again. 3-25-18 10:45am."}
{"text":"Stopped in during a soccer tournament from Greenville SC. What a great find! Food is awesome and service even better. I must!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for crepes. I never ate crepes prior to visiting this restaurant and can't get enough of them now. They make them gluten free for me and always remember me whenever I come in to eat. I love this restaurant.  I wish they were closer to where I lived, but i pay them a visit as often as I'm in the Matthews area.  My first time going here, they had a pizza crepe that I would order gluten free. It was so good, but unfortunately they no longer offer it. I now build a crepe with barbecue sauce, black beans, tomatoes, bacon and chicken, which I absolutely love. And I always get the apple pie dessert crepe (I think that's what it's called). Without nuts and whipped cream and I absolutely love that as well. By far one of my favorite restaurants of all time :)"}
{"text":"It was our first time checking out this place and the crepes were so delicious! We ordered the Philly cheesesteak and gyro crepes and inhaled it so quickly. We were greeted by Elena, the shop owner, who was so sweet and kind to guide us through the menu! And their tea selection is awesome! A gen in the Matthews area for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered banana foster which was amazing. You can customize your order variety of fruits and sauces. The owner personally asks each customer who the food tastes and runs down the menu. They have a new location in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"read prior reveiw and tried it last night found it as good as prior reveiw. had philly cheesesteak and it was great"}
{"text":"This place is yummy, had their tiramisu crepe one time it was delicious, will be back!  Dinner crepes are always tasty as well"}
{"text":"We started with the Philly cheesesteak and the chicken chipotle crepes for dinner and the ordered the peach cobbler crepe for dessert. EVERYTHING was perfect and the peach cobbler was beyond amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious. And the owners are so sweet. Place is always packed, but don't let that scare you away. There is usually a seat open by the time your crepe is made. Make sure you get a coffee too they are wonderful."}
{"text":"Service was so friendly and helpful. Food was great. Had gluten free and was very pleased to have the option. They even delivered to us next door at the beer hall. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Let me first state that in my mind, these crepes shouldn't be so expensive. I will be generous with my stars, though, as Miss Elena is with her kindness and service. The place on it's own is 4.99 stars...just a little ding for the price. Anyway.....  I do love this place. The food is so good. I had the florentine with bacon two days in a row (don't judge me). I have yet to try any of their sweet crepes or  beverages, but I am highly impressed by their offerings. I did smell the tea samples they had available and saw the fun way it is served, so I'm look forward to my next visit for that purpose/purchase.   As I mentioned above, the service here is stellar. The owner is a very kind, friendly woman and the employees are pleasant to deal with as well. On one of my recent visits, as I was leaving, I saw Miss Elana going above and beyond to take an order to a customer who was having a drink at an establishment a few doors down. Stellar, stellar service.  Go for the food, stay for the service and perhaps a friendly conversation."}
{"text":"My office ordered lunch from here today. We had the chipotle chicken, gyro, and chicken cordon bleu (which is actually a chicken club crepe).  They were all delicious!  The chipotle sauce is just spicy enough and the crepes are well made. I have visited the crepe cellar in NODA which is good but much pricier and this place is just as good.  We will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is AMAZING!  The crepes are cooked to perfection - thin, slightly crispy on the edges.  The menu is well put together with savory crepes like Chicken Chipotle, Philly Cheesesteak and the Hamster (eggs, ham and cheese).  The sweet crepes also do not disappoint - strawberry cheesecake, S'mores and PB n' J.  They also have varied options for making your own sweet or savory crepes with everything from avocados and chicken to nutella and marshmellows. I had the Chicken Chipotle - delicious, perfect amount of ingredients and super tasty.  It was filling, so if you think crepes are dainty - this one was not. My kids had the Hamster, which was more of a traditional crepe.  Then the S'more for desert - yum. The coffee and tea there is the true hidden jem.  If you've had enough of cookie cutter Starbucks - try this.  The tea comes loose leafed in this genius tea carrier, perfect for one person.  The coffee is fresh ground, delicious and they know how to put the right amount of foam on a cappuccino. The owner, Lena, is a wonderful woman and her bright smile and warm nature makes the space light up.  It's a cozy neighborhood place and we look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The Crepes here are out of the world!! For two crepes and a coffee we payed about 20 dollars...it is a bit pricey but worth it,the atmosphere is okay,nothing special...the service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes! Unusual ingregients like hummus, roast beef, gyro, etc to name but a few. But the quality is there along with great and friendly customer service from the staff!  Had the Hummus and Roast Beef crepes which were excellent! I asked for gyro meat but they could have added chicken if you wanted.   Best thing about this place is tgat everything is customizable. ..so substitute whatever YOU like to make ur tummy and taste buds happy!  Overall a really great place for crepes! Need to come back to try their sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Visited this quaint place this morning. Fabulously friendly! The menu features breakfast & desert crepes, coffee, loose leaf teas. First note- Delicious coffee!!! (SN:They make their own blend.) This was my very first time having crepes so I have no reference for comparison. But I shared the breakfast Turkey & Avocado crepe by owner recommendation and it was so very delicious!!! They also offer gluten free crepes if your tummy or palate prefers that! Will be going back and I highly recommend trying it out! Great little place in downtown Matthews!"}
{"text":"What a treat! The Gyro and the Philly are both great. Everything came out hot and fresh. The crepe was tender and crispy at the same time. The owner was at the register and was very nice and took the time to explain everything to us since this was our first time here. They also have some patio seating and that was really enjoyable. Now we are headed to check out the Beer Temple next door."}
{"text":"Best crepes ever! 5 star service too =D I heard this place had really good crepes, so I came here with my friend a few days ago after lunch and I have to say we were blown away.  The ladies there were really nice too! I ordered peach tea and me and my friend thought of splitting a shortcake crepe. They asked if we were splitting it and when we said yes they were kind enough to tell us that they just wanted to know so they could make us individual crepes, she said \"crepes are art and we want you guys to enjoy it =)\" I'm sorry but I thought that was really nice, and so sincere. Most places will just give you the one crepe and let you cut it yourself. They were beyond friendly and helpful.  The order didn't take long and the crepe was delicious. The cream cheese wasn't overpowering, it wasn't super sweet, (I don't like excessively sweet desserts) and it felt so light. The place itself was small but very clean and  cozy, you just want to stay there and talk forever. (we sat there for about an hour)  Their peach tea was amazing, (if you like tea I recommend you order one of their teas). It's pretty far from where I live but I will definitely be coming back to this place to try their other crepe options."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Be patient. Making fresh Crepes takes time. Your wait is worth it. Have a nice cup of coffee or hot tea (I had orange cranberry-so good!). My husband and I both had a lunch crepe. So good! We saved room for desert too! This is a must go place!"}
{"text":"For Dessert we were impressed with \"Royal Trinity\"  Perfectik Bananas and Strawberries FRESH and sliced thin, Nutella from a Jar... Stacked into Quarter Fold stacked. Powdered Sugar Whipped Cream and Chocolate Syrup made it as Beautiful as it was Delicious!!!  They also have the Non-Dessert Crepes and a \"Be-your-own-Chef\" Create your own combination of Ingredients for a Rod0 Oringinal (in my case), though I ordered from the Menu because what we ordered sounded and was Superb!!!  Nice Feature because I love creating great Food combinations!   Coffee FANTSATISHKA!!!   Flavor!  I'm Totally Confident a little more with experience (I have Very little) I could figure out how to Order some Coffee here!  These first two were FLAVORFUL!  Roasted in Charlotte!  Cubano  for me  Cafe Mocha for my Bride  Crepes: : Grandmother and Great Grandmother brought their Recipes  From Russia!  Indoor Dinning and Outdoor Sidewalk Seating!"}
{"text":"I had ordered loose leaf green tea and a custom made crepe that had spinach, onion, avocado, grilled mushrooms, gyro, and goat cheese with Greek sauce. The flavor was incredible, the helping more than adequate I left full! Really enjoyed the freshly brewed green tea they also have custom coffees freshly ground, I will have to try an espresso next time. Yes, there will be a next time! The only advice I will add is you may want to sit and enjoy your coffee or tea with a book (I carry one with me at all times) or enjoy good conversation as you watch them make your crepe. It takes a while but certainly worrth the wait! Loved the smell of the dessert crepe being made while I read. Nice relaxing Sunday afternoon. Don't go if you are in a rush, but then Crepes are not fast food! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place would get 10 stars if possible!! As soon as we walked in we were greeted the menu was explained, it was our first time there and we were warmly welcomed. The service was excellent! You can watch your food cooked while you wait which was a show in itself and my mouth was watering the whole time. I ordered the turkey and bacon crepe it was wonderful nice and crispy yet soft the toppings were plentiful it was so big that really surprised me.  I had a caramel latte which was delicious. My BF got the Gyro crepe also super yummy he also got a Cuban coffee which he said was done just right. Everything was so good we decided to split a berry crepe which had strawberries, blueberries, and lemon cream cheese with a strawberry sauce over it....OMG we both had total foodgasims....I wish they were open right now so we could go back...it was that good!"}
{"text":"We've been twice and enjoyed our meals both times.  My favorite is the \"Mediterranean.\"  My husband's favorite is the Gyro.  Friendly & helpful service.  They accommodate substitutions or you can make up your own crepe from the wide selection of ingredients.  They also offer good loose leaf teas and coffee.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Not sure the name of the crepe I had but it had turkey and avacado in it and was fantastic...can't wait to go back!  The ingredients were so fresh which is what I think made the difference.  They welcome you to modify your crepe as you want so that you will truely be happy with your meal.  I think the best part of these crepes are that they are simple; they use a few quality ingredients.  I hate when there are so many ingredients in something that you can't even tell what you are eating. So if the crepes are wonderfully fantastic I don't think there is a word out there to describe the coffee.  I have never had a cappaccino that I didn't have to put some kind of sweetner in.  It was amazing.  The owner is so knowledgable on the coffee they serve and how to pull the perfect espresso and it definitely shows in the drinks.  They only serve local coffee within a week of its roasting (don't think it gets much fresher than that).  With very reasonable prices, friendly owners, fresh food, and amazing coffee I hope to see this place stick around for awhile.  The only down side for me is that it is all the way in Matthews, but is totally worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"The food was carefully prepared and very good. Portions are large with a lot of variety. You can mix and match ingredients to suit any taste or dietary restriction. The cafe only seats 24 inside and 6 outside. We waited until after 1 pm to avoid a long wait at lunch. The only issue which might be a problem is that the cooking surfaces are right in the middle of the seating area and they put out a lot of heat. We were there on a cool day and it was very warm in the restaurant. When we go there again it will be for take out and we will call ahead to place our order. Their business model is for take out."}
{"text":"What a cute little place, first time here. Great service, friendly area, crapes wetter delicious ,I had  chicken blue and shared dessert... Ice cream, crape drizzle carmel"}
{"text":"I had come to the royal creperie with high expectations because their yelp reviews were so good. I was a little surprised when I walked in that it was a counter service restaurant, but it didn't affect the delicious factor or the customer service.  Our crepe maker walked us through the menu, told us what was good and then made us an amazing dinner. I had the gyro crepe and my husband had the Philly. Both of them exceeded our expectations.  The owner was also there, and was extremely friendly. Two boys came in doing a psych experiment to see if they could get free food if they asked for it. She said yes instantly, which was both nice and entertaining.  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Authentic crispy thin crepes!  The savory crepes are delicious too. After many moons of searching we've finally found our creperie.  EDIT: This is our 4th time.  We have out of town visitors from Canada from the French Quebec.  They absolutely loved the quality, presentation and the authentic taste.  5 Stars again on all counts!  Too bad you're not located a block a way from us!"}
{"text":"I had planned on visiting the Royal Cafe and Creperie for some time, but finally got to go there for lunch today. Not only was the wait staff and Cooks friendly and efficient, but the food was absolutely delicious. There was quite a variety of Crepes available, from breakfast crepes to Savory lunch and dinner Crepes, and quite a variety of dessert Crepes as well. My friend and I split an entree crepe as well as the Banana Foster crepe it was on special for dessert. I also got a specialty coffee which was done just right. Everyone was friendly and outgoing comma and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful surprise when we had lunch at Royal Cafe and Creperie!!!  Alexis and her crew greeted us warmly, explained the menu, and allowed us space to decide.  We had the omega 3, turkey bacon breakfast crepe, and the Mediterranean, all were delicious. They brought our dessert crepe, pumpkin spice, once we were almost done with our tasty lunch and had it split into thirds without being asking. Our coffees were served in attractive mugs and were hot and perfectly made.  We'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been several times to this creperie. I have sampled several of the crepes that are offered. I can genuinely say that this place offers some quality-made crepes. If you are looking for a crepe to fulfill that sweet tooth's desire, I recommend the Royal Trinity. If you are looking for a delicious and fulfilling meal, I recommend the Smoky Chipotle Chicken."}
{"text":"Best Crepes around! They offer gluten free options too. The owners are always there and working hard. They are kind, welcoming and happy to make any changes you want. You also get to watch them make the crepes right in front of you - its very interesting! All of their ingredients are always fresh!! This is a weekly stop for me and my roommate!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a sweet with my girlfriend and drove quite a distance for this place. The drive was worth it because the nutella, banana and strawberry crepe was super yummy. I got an iced coffee too but that was pretty watery, stay away."}
{"text":"This cafe knows how to make the most delicious crepes! I'm in LOVE with both the savory and sweet ones they have on menu. When you walk in you're instantly hit with the amazing smell of cooked crepes and greeted by smiley employees! I always feel welcome and the prices here are very reasonable. The understated paper plates might make you second guess this cafe, but once you take a bite you'll realize that they know how to make their crepes the real stars of the show. I recommend ordering both a savory and sweet crepe, and then sharing it with someone so that you can indulge in the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Omg I just LOVE the people here! As soon as we walked in the owner introduced herself, and walked us though the menu. Boy they got A LOT of drink options! They had a variety of coffees, and teas. Owner said she's really into healthy natural stuff, which is always great to hear. The vibes of the place felt really homey, like a family feel which was really nice. The owner suggested us to order the Bavarian crepe, she told us it was their most famous & its also prettiest haha! They also use paper plates here, and metal utensils. The cream was very light, it didn't really have much of a taste, the crepe was good. (It wasn't the best I've had, it was just okay.) Overall I really like the feels, and the lovely people here so I would come back to try their lattes/tea but I don't think I would go out of my way for the crepes! But they were also showcase in the newspaper & TV, how awesome is that?? (:"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Friday morning at 930, no wait. Had the special (an egg Benedict crepe - ham, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, spinach, an over easy egg, and hollandaise) on a gluten free crepe!  Wow.  Very fresh and not over cooked at all.  The over easy egg just melted into the dish for a wonderful breakfast.  The ladies here are very helpful since there are so many choices, including selection of your own ingredients.  Be patient....there are two crepe plates cooking and each can take 8-10 minutes.  They also have very good coffee with all the typical coffee shop choices.  A bonus is the vast selection of loose leaf tea and blends.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, quaint place for lunch! Owners are obviously prideful of what they do. Refreshing change from all the other Matthew's eateries. The loose leaf tea selection makes you want to go back again and again to try a different type and a different crepe to go with it!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem in the heart of downtown Matthews! The Hamazing crepe was expertly cooked and a savory delight! Our kids enjoyed building their own crepes with just the toppings they wanted. The owners and staff were friendly, engaging, and customer focused! We followed our meal with the Royal Trinity (who doesn't love fruit, Nutella and whipped cream) and Carmel Apple Pie (apples, Carmel cinnamon and butter) crepes! So delicious. Serious coffee and tea drinkers will both find wonderful options here. The coffee is a locally roasted blend that is rich and smooth, with no bitterness! They also offer 30 different blends of gourmet fresh brewed tea. My wife raved about the iced peach oolong tea she ordered! This was our first time at Royal Cafe & Creperie, but it definitely won't be our last!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Although, I was shocked to see the prices. For our family of four, including two teas & coffees, it was $65! Yikes!! The owner seemed to be pushy on additional toppings to raise the sale. This will be a once in awhile place to eat for us...lol"}
{"text":"Stopped in for coffee and crepes. The coffee was very good. Excellent selection. I just had an Americano, and it was very nice.   The crepes, on the other hand, were sub-par. Nice selection, and I think they use good ingredients. I think the problem was in the preparation. They were over done, and if you know what a good crepe should feel like when you bite into it, anything less just won't do.  It wasn't just mine, but my wife's as well. I think the young lady who made them just wasn't very good at it.    The service was very good, however. I'd go back for a coffee, but will pass on the crepe."}
{"text":"Excellent local joint. Little pricey for our liking but the owners we love and do come every now and then."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Very welcoming. I love the masala chai (very similar to what we Indians have). The crepes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Whenever my already-lacking sanity gives way to pregnancy-level craving, only one place is the quintessential fix: Royal. Imaginatively, their huge crepes wrap your little body in perfectly light, perfectly warm holiness... whichever fresh toppings you fancy smothering every nook and cranny in righteous all-that's-well-in-the-world.  The variety and execution of Royal's crepe offerings are excellent, and with management who knows not what grouchiness is, you'll never leave unsatisfied nor without having a grand time. Prices are more than reasonable, atmosphere chipper. And as much as I'd like to thank Black Chicken or Carolina for pre-gaming cheerfulness prior to setting foot in Royal, their respective wines and beers can't hold a candle to the all-knowing, all-powerful crepe king that is Royal C&C.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.75 - Food taste and quality = 4.75 - Portion size = 4.25 - Price = 4 - Atmosphere = 4.5 - General service = 5 - Waitstaff = 5 - Location = 5"}
{"text":"The crepes are delicious here. I'm pretty picky, so I love the option to build my own crepe. I usually always order a mocha to go with it. They've got excellent espresso drinks at Royal. My husband is a tea lover and the tea menu is ... huge! Lots of interesting an unusual options on there. If it intimidates you, ask for a recommendation. They recommended the lychee one to my husband and he loved it. One note, If you're going at lunch time on a Saturday ... expect it to be packed. It's not a huge place so it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! It's hard to make a decision between the mouth watering crêpes and the always smiling owners. The menu is enough to make anyone drool just by looking at it! And don't forget to order some loose leaf tea while trying to make a decision. There's a great tea selection."}
{"text":"So excited about getting a Crepe café so close to home! We tried it today for breakfast crepes - it was great! I had the \"create your own\" -with egg & cheese and I added spinach, shrooms, and ham - that was one giant crepe!   They have locally roasted coffee, tea  and a small selection of other drinks. I would be really happy if they had wine or cocktails for a nice after-dinner dessert spot. Maybe we can get them partnered up with the Black Chicken...hmmm?   Will definitely be back soon - hopefully for the nutella & strawberry!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it, but the problem is that I ordered a crepe that ended up being mostly crepe without any insides. I told them that I wanted a crepe with egg whites, turkey, spinach, swiss, and raspberry aioli. I thought surely that would be enough ingredients to have a hearty crepe. It wasn't.  The question is: why didn't they put enough of what I had selected in-between the folds of the crepe to make it yummy?  It COULD have been, but it just wasn't.  Add on top of that that the iced tea was probably the worst I have had all year.  Yes, I understand that they had a great selection of teas from which to choose. I simply ordered a plain iced tea.   Normally, I go through a glass of iced tea with two refills and one to go.  I didn't even make it through one glass here. Toilet water may have been better.  The best part of the meal was having lunch with my friend, Ginny. As always, we had a great time together.   This restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the lady taking the order was filled with a lot of character.   Doesn't matter how good the character is when the food didn't cut the mustard.  It didn't even come close for me, despite all the other fanfare on YELP."}
{"text":"You can't visit the Beer Temple without craving a Crepe - I don't think it's humanly possible. Very good selection of both savory and sweet crepes (they'll even bring it to the Temple for you). If you don't see a combo that interests you, the basic crepe starts at $4.50 and you can add ingredients a la carte. I kept it simple with strawberry, whipped cream and powdered sugar ( I have Nutella burnout unfortunately). The strawberries could have been a lot riper but at least someone sliced them and had them sitting in simple syrup. Texture and flavor were both about right. Hot Bergamot tea - perfect temp and strength. Really nice to have a place like this around for something out of the ordinary. Can't wait to try a savory crepe."}
{"text":"The crepes here are really good, and they're really creative. My wife and I usually each choose a savory crepe and then split a sweet crepe for dessert. The crepes are always perfectly cooked. Some crepes, however, are better than others. The pumpkin crepe, for instance, was lackluster and missing some ingredients when I first tried it, but it was amazing (and complete) the second time I tried it.  The selection of teas is great, and I love the pots the teas are served in. I'm a big fan of the ginger peach tea, and I get it each time I come here.  Overall, this is a place where the service is great and the food is consistently good. A meal that's actually filling can get a bit pricey, but coming here for a light lunch or a snack is perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast and lunch! The staff is incredibly nice and the crepes are delicious. The hamster crepe is my favorite while my boyfriend loves the florentine. I love this place!"}
{"text":"After keeping this place booked mark for a couple of months.  I finally decided to stop in for something sweet for breakfast.  I've had a crepe before years ago at ihop and one come style in San Francisco.  I'm not a crepe person as prefer (and more use to) pancakes and French toast.  The reviews and ratings were quite high so I decided to give it a go.  I wasn't planning to eat in but there were only 3 people dining on a rainy afternoon so I decided to enjoy my time.  As I walked in the owner came in after me after speaking with patrons outside.  She greeted me and asked if it was my first time on the way to the register.  I checked out the menu with her although I had looked at the help menu beforehand.  The owner suggested an immediate review for a lunch item a patron just finished.  He seemed honest but maybe not fulfilled.  I decided to stick with a dessert cake but asked about the specials.  The owner was trying to ring up my first thought or locate it in the computer.  I decided to try the banana foster since it was featured on the board and I've never had banana foster anything.  Then she suggested a coffee.  There's a big selection of coffee ranging from $1.85-3.85 for smalls and med/lrg.  I didn't want a suggested breve for $3 so I went with a $2 salted caramel coffee.  A little pushy although suggestive but I reminded her I was on a budget.  My total came out to $13!...the coffee was prepared with state of the art coffee machine but was very bland.  I went to the counter and the manager was concerned.  She added some syrup and wanted me to try it again then walked away.  I asked the waitress to add some more and more.  Then a sweet European woman brought my crepe to the table.  The portion was big and presentation was pretty with ice cream on the side.  The inn part was more moist and the rest kind of dry which left it hard to cut with a knife.  I wasn't checked on anymore during my whole sitting while I ate.  I believe everyone went to back because no one else came in for a while or chattery of patrons still sitting.  I left out and not even a good wishful day was given.  Forget coming back for even the gyro crepe.  I only feel regret for not going elsewhere to spend that $13 and tip.  I only tip if someone when your of there way to tell me more about the menu.  I could of had a complete breakfast for that much money.  I'm only completely full of gas right now from the coffee."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner. Her energy is amazing and her food and drink suggestions are on point. I found this in error and I am glad I did everything was delicious! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming...a diamond in the rough. What it lacks in ambiance and decor it makes up in great tasting crepes packed with mouthwatering stuffings. This place is great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and definitely desert. I recommend the roast beast, Philly cheesesteak, and the smoky chicken chipotle."}
{"text":"A wonderful amazing place that my whole family loved and had traffic lunch - the Philadelphia  Cheese steak was fresh with a kick to it !!!!"}
{"text":"I fell in love the first time I tried this place. Customer service is great they will always come up and ask how everything is and if you need anything else. Family owned so I love it even more. I'm not big on desert but here it's AMAZING"}
{"text":"I just stop by at this place for breakfast on Weekend. It's mid size place near to Mathews rail raid area.The menu had so many options for breakfast veg/non veg. I have tried protein pie it was really delicious.  Price kind of expensive just for break fast around including coffee it come 10$. It's good place to try and taste some food."}
{"text":"The food was good and it was gluten free. The price deemed a bit high for what you get. I had breakfast. Maybe the lunch offerings are better. I was not that impressed with the interior though it was clean snd serviceable. I preferred eating out doors which was fine on a warm sunny morning."}
{"text":"Very good crepe, I just came in for a dessert crepe, their banana Nutella crepe. When I walked in I was impressed, it sorta set up like a marble slab or similarly such, it has the work station front and center so that everyone can watch the crepe be made and all the additives around the center circular griddle. Anyhow I placed my order with who I figured was the owner, dressed in all black, with an Eastern European accent. She was friendly enough, anyhow I placed my order got my ticket and sat. It came out quickly. When I got the crepe it was very thick full of bananas and Nutella. Every night had banana in it, which is a major plus. It was also rather large for the price, and best of all it was perfect for a quick dessert. A place defiantly worth visiting. I was actually visiting charlotte but was referred there by an Uber driver...."}
{"text":"- above average service. very kind lady who runs the place...hard to say no to her...  - nice array of both savory and sweet crepes with a few specials off the menu  - the ability to build-your-own crepe is a nice amenity, also  - the coffee/espresso is solid...they also have the ability to concoct frappuccino (sp) -like blended drinks   - reasonably priced...I didn't notice any meal deals, which was a deterrent. It would have been nice to not have to add chips and a drink a la carte   - small area of outdoor seating, which was much preferred today to the overly warm temp inside   - first timer that will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I just savored the last bite of my strawberry shortcake crep & it was absolutely an experience. It's mother's day so It was a bit of a wait but totally worth every minute of anticipation!  This is a must try & a new favorite for me!"}
{"text":"Fast service with a lot of options to choose from. I wanted to try them all! They have gluten free ones too!! They split up the crepes so my husband and I could share. Also, had a few San pellegrinos I hadn't had before! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great crepes! Crepes were nice, light, and just the right crispness on the ends. The atmosphere is cozy and friendly. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and fun! I had the Smoked Chicken Chipotle crepe and it was awesome! Then I topped it off with the special dessert of the month....the Tiramisu crepe. Outta this world! I plan to back and try a breakfast crepe and can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've been so close to this place for so long and never even knew it was here. My wife and came in and were greeted by the extremely friendly owner. She told us all about the menu and made some great recommendations! will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly and helpful owners, amazing savory and sweet crepes! I can't wait to go back and try their coffee and tea! I wish I had taken a picture but I didn't hesitate when my crepe was put in front of me :-)"}
{"text":"Love it! Had the s'more crepe and really enjoyed it! Will be back to try some of the other flavors! Love that they offer gluten free as well!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited the shop for the first time recently. I was delighted by the GF options and separate GF utensils and grill! That Saturday morning was very busy, but the employees were doing their best to be efficient and positive. We waited a little while for our crepes, but the meal was worth it! The crepes were absolutely delicious and nicely presented.   My one criticism is that the lattes were just okay. If the shop switches to a better espresso, their lattes would be worth the $4.  With their good staff and crepes, we will certainly visit this place again!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot for daytime noshing.  I am a super big fan of crepes, especially savory ones.  I had the Lean Machine and it was delish!  I would get it sans tzaziki sauce as a re-order (not very \"lean\" and didn't add much flavor IMO).  In addition to their menu of sweet and savory crepes, you can build your own with a ton of creative filling options.  In addition to the crepes, there are really great locally-roasted coffees and about thirty teas.  I had a jasmine tea iced and they brewed it fresh in this cute little pot and then poured it over ice in a small pitcher table. Delicious and refreshing on a hot summer day.  Last but not least, all our communications with staff were friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to make it here for a second visit!"}
{"text":"Love it! My wife and I saw this place when we were about to go into Beantown. We had been to a creperie in Alaska once and decided to try this one out. I had the Chipotle chicken and my wife had cordon blue. I had their house blended coffee and she had hot white pear tea from their impressive tea bar.  Everything was so good we had to get the carmel apple pie crepe for desert. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the food came out fast and delicious. There are only 7 tables, so it's small, but there are a couple of tables outside. The tea was was amazingly good (I'm not a tea person, but tried my wife's and really liked it) the coffee was really good too. If I had to make a critique, we would have liked real plates rather than paper. The tea and coffee come in glass and you get real silverware, so real plates would be nice. Other than that, perfect creperie. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"OMG! I can't get enough of this place! They will challenge your idea of what a crepe \"should be\" and show you what it can be! Made fresh to order! Suggestions: hamster crepe and the strawberry short cake one with graham crackers, but you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. Make sure you get one to go. You'll wish you had!  Also, they are closed on Mondays. :("}
{"text":"The Crepes are awesome! Every bit was delicious! Coffee was great. The staff was great! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute real thing.  Crepes made while you watch.  Super Thin and just the right amount of topping.  Sweet batter makes your sandwich taste like dessert.  And the looseleaf teas were the best.      Rare to find authenticity like this !"}
{"text":"Great food and great people! Their crepes are delicious, and the staff is quick and friendly! A great atmosphere, especially for a weekend brunch.  I've always thought of crepes to be just sweet, but they make some awesome savory crepes too.  Also, the coffee was very good.  Royal Cafe & Creperie is a must check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. The owner is so friendly. Huge selection of coffees and teas. Lots of tasty crepes. The place is really small and kind of cheap-looking. Still recommended."}
{"text":"Great place in Matthews! By far the Best crepes in charlotte! Amazing local coffee and lots of loose leaf teas to choose from. Owners are genuinely friendly and caring! So glad they have another location in Dilworth with even more goodies.!"}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUM!   This place was great!  They just opened in Matthews a couple of weeks ago..in the same section of downtown Matthews as Thai Taste and Beantown Tavern.    It's a small comfy place with a handful of tables.  I met the owners (Mother and Daughter, maybe?) and they were both so sweet and so helpful (we had never been to a Creperie before).  They were genuinely thankful to hear that the word is out and even us folks from the Waxhaw side of town are taking the drive to check it out.  The menu is a nice blend of pre-designed creations (substitutions are welcomed!) and delicious lists of items to customize your own.  They even have a great selection of Coffees, Teas, and Bottled/Canned drinks (soda, sparkling waters, juice, etc).  All of their coffees are roasted in the Charlotte area and the Loose Leaf Teas are also local (and there's a GREAT selection, too!).   My husband had a Sugar Free Hazelnut Latte, my son had a Cafe Mocha, and I had a Cafe Au Lait.   All were smooth and delicious.  It took us a few minutes to decide on our breakfast crepes because there are so many great choices.  I opted for this week's special crepe, the \"3 Omegas\".  It was fantastic!  The flavors were great and everything was so fresh!  The 3 Omegas had  Spinach, Avocado, Feta, Black Olives, Walnuts, Black Beans, Basil Pesto, and Red Onion.  My husband had the \"Ranchero\".  It has eggs, salsa, black bans, red onions, and Jack Cheese.  My son opted for a sweet crepe...the \"Smores\"...it has Marshmallows, chocolate chips, and graham cracker crumbs and he added Coconut to it.  As to be expected with a growing teenager, that wasn't quite enough so after he inhaled the Smores Crepe, he ordered a Ranchero with Chicken instead of Black Beans.  The Crepes are large enough to share (unless you're a growing teenager, like my son) and the prices are reasonable.  We will definitely go back!   As a matter of fact, I told my husband that it's a good thing it's a 25 minute from our house or I would be there more often than I should be!  :-)"}
{"text":"Too small, no place to sit down...the people that were there and done were in no hurry to leave and management/wait staff has no idea how to turn tables...can't tell you about the food...since there was no where to sit we didn't stick around....Waffle House."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes with the added bonus of a wonderful tea selection. Our group ran the gamete from sweet to savory crepe fans, and no one was the least bit unsatisfied! We all loved everything we ordered and the service was friendly and helpful...even enthusiastic about their menu. The loose teas were fantastic and the coffee was great for those that weren't tea drinkers. Can't wait till the next time we're in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"The family was excited to try the Crepes so we arrived before they opened. We all loved the variety available and tried everything from standard omelette options to dessert crepes. All 5 of us enjoyed our crepes and will be stopping by again when we visit the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I am really not a creperie person. Let's face it - I don't even know what a creperie person is. Or what a creperie is. I barely know what a crepe is. But we happened to be hanging out at Matthews Station - which seems different every time we're there - and noticed this place that we'd never seen. So we stopped in.  There isn't much to it. If I hadn't seen the sign outside, or the griddle for cooking crepes, it could have passed for a froyo shop. On that note, you actually have to be careful - because much like a froyo shop, you can make your own crepe (not quite literally) by adding your own ingredients, which can add up. On another note, this might have been where Carvel used to be way back when.  Anyway, beyond a counter with the aforementioned griddle, a menu describing the crepes, and some tables for consuming those crepes, there isn't a lot here. So peruse that menu, figure out what you'd like, and get to eating.  Staff is friendly, and can help you decide - but in the end, you simply have to determine what you want on yours, and there isn't much to it. The experience isn't all that grand. Creperie is a bit much, and it sounds better than it is, but it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Too bad it's so out of the way for us. We ordered the turkey avocado crepe but replaced the egg with their red pepper pesto. Mmmmm it was SO good (photos posted)! We also tried the strawberry cream, without the cream. You can never go wrong with Nutella in crepes. The owners are very friendly and the best part was watching our crepes being made. I'm glad we got a chance to try this place before it got too crowded but I'm guessing once people hear of it, it will get super busy. Also, their coffee is locally roasted in Charlotte and the teas are from Tea-Rex -- my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out and today did not disappoint! Yes, it was probably the height of busy-ness 1145 AM on a Sunday but it didn't take long to get our order. Gluten free Eggs Benedict crepe and for the sweet, the Royal with banana, strawberries and Nutella  The crepe was cooked to perfection with enough char to know it wasn't rushed nor ignored. The egg, spinach,mushroom and Hollandaise sauce were all fresh and delicious. Learned from the owner that a second location just opened Uptown. Check them out, wonderful food and personal service."}
{"text":"My husband and I had cappuccinos and shared a strawberry and Nutella crepe, and both were phenomenal! The crepe tasted better than any that we had in Paris! Also, very cute decor and friendly staff as well as other patrons!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Had the Philly cheese steak it was very flavorful! So was my cappuccino! But I became extremely irritated by the lack of staff's concern or willingness to remove a person from the only available table that was being occupied by non paying customer! The place was packed and 3 other customers came in after we ordered and there was no where for any of us to sit! With a limited seating there needs to be a monitoring system in order for paying customers to fully enjoy their experience! If your whole party has not arrived then you should not be allowed to hold a table!"}
{"text":"Really delicious, friendly staff, you watch them cook.  They just need to be closer to our house and I would go every week."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes. The real deal. Genuine crepes, loose leaf teas, gourmet coffee. Wonderful staff. Small place. Great for two to four people."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem this place is! After visiting the Carolina Beer Temple we wanted something light for dinner. This place is amazing and the food and service is spectacular. My husband had the gyro crepe (suggested by the owner) and he LOVED it. I made my own crepe and it was also delicious but I will definitely choose one of their menu crepes next time."}
{"text":"Personal service and tasty food make this place a gem. The crepes are amazing whether you get breakfast, savory or sweet. The mix of flavor is a taste explosion!  But it goes beyond the great taste. The service here is one of a kind. You are greeted with a smile, orders are prepared promptly, and if you are having a difficult time deciding on a crepe, they will take the time to help you decide.   Support local and get a wonderful treat with delicious crepes."}
{"text":"Good crepes great coffee not particularly cozy inside though. Cheap tables and chairs. I had the ham and cheese crepe first time was excellent second time not so much. Good place to stop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It was okay ... Nothing impressive. Not worth the $$ I ordered the hamamazing crepe. Very little ham and Swiss cheese. Filled with more lettuce. Trying to be cheap..."}
{"text":"Excellent crepe and excellent drink selections.  Had a hard time choosing the drinks we want and ended up we got the lychee plum green tea and ice mocha freeze.  The mocha freeze is way better than Starbucks and my wife loves the tea set.  We also had the buffalo chicken crepe and it tastes wonderfully.  Definitely worth the visit and we will be back.  Thanks."}
{"text":"So yummy. Very friendly. My personal favorite is the strawberry/Nutella/banana crepe.   I make crepes at home quite often but this place has a delightful touch when I feel like getting out of the house."}
{"text":"Royal Cafe and Creperie is really as good as it gets for a fun meal. There is a wide variety of coffee and tea and the crepes are perfectly cooked with plenty of options.   Service: Our server, Elena was so kind and friendly. Right when we walked in we were greeted and given a run-down of the menu. We came on a weekday at lunchtime and it wasn't too busy. We found a seat easily and were served in an appropriate amount of time. Additionally, we told the server that we were splitting out crepe and they served us each a crepe (original order comes with two) on our own plate.  Food: Delicious. We got a dessert crepe with nutella, bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup, powdered sugar and whipped cream on top. The crepe was soft with crispy edges and the filling was tasty and well portioned. The crepe cost $8.50 which is a bit more than I would hope, but the portion size is very large (hence why we split it) and it's nice for a treat.  Drinks: My sister ordered a cubano (strong espresso and sugar) and I ordered a 16 oz Black tea with cardamom. Both were very tasty. I would recommend splitting the tea with someone though, because I easily got three mugs of tea from that 16oz mug which is a lot for me. The tea is served in a cute little brewer that you hover over your mug and dispenses the tea which is a nice touch. The tea costs $3.25 and there are at least 30 teas to choose from and the cubano was $2.  Royal Cafe is a great addition to downtown Matthews and I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"This is our most FAVORITE place to go to. They have breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert options. So so so good! Anything I order anything I am absolutely satisfied, especially if you pair it with some coffee or tea :)) the owners are the best!! So loving and kind, the best customer service :) they are a blessing indeed!"}
{"text":"I thought I had written a review previously. First off this is a must to visit if you like crepes. They offer breakfast-dinner. With a variety of offerings. The vegetables are really tasty even for the dead of winter. The chicken I am still wondering if it is brought in frozen. I know the answer, but everything else is so fresh I just don't want to beleieve they use frozen Tyson chicken. At any rate the flavors we have tried in a variety of breakfast and lunch crepes are Delish!! My son got the banana and Nutella Crepe with creme and it was like a dessert. I had a Mediterranean one with ripe avocados, tomatoes, spinach, chick and a few other vegs. It was really good. It is a small rest tucked in the Mathews station across from the yucky Beantown rest that we tried on and off for years and they consistently got worse and worse... It's just a good ole bar, don't go there for any food! Bla but put this creperie on your list it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow - what a find. Small place with not exactly a cozy atmosphere but the food was outstanding. The service was great, you can tell that the proprietress really likes people. The coffee was freshly roasted and ground, and tasted great. It always surprises me when I actually get really good coffee at a breakfast place, must places do one or the other well (e.g. Starbucks - good coffee, abominable breakfast) this place nailed it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Love the food and atmosphere! And the owner (Ms. Elena) is so sweet and nice!! Don't forget to try their coffee is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of sweet and savory crepes with a great selection of coffee and tea makes Royal Cafe a win. I am a huge fan of their pumpkin spice crepe when they have it available seasonally otherwise I just pick whatever is on their specials board. Hint: the specials board is posted up on the wall just beyond the cash register.   My most recent stop in led me to a bananas foster crepe with added strawberries as a suggestion. This crepe was massive and perfect to share. It came with vanilla ice cream as an added bonus. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered a savory crepe and was not thrilled. It was all premade chicken from a packet, bacon chips and iceberg lettuce shreds. People I was with has sweet crepes and liked them. I guess it depends on what you order"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the best places for breakfast and dessert crepes.. Description to why I put 4 stars... The food is good, but the prices are through the ceiling.. They over charge for the food.   Slavic owned eatery, with a taste of culture."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was very flavorful. I had the 8 am and my wife had the Hamster. They have several selections of loose leaf tea brought to the table in a Teaze brewer. Definitely  will come back."}
{"text":"The new Spring Fling crepe is fabulous and the service is still do friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"5 stars from this gal. I don't give 5 often but this is worth it. Service was so friendly. The owner Elaina and her daughter Alexis greeted us and made us feel like family.  We went on a Sunday morning before the church crowd got there so didn't have to have a long wait.   Hubby got the Bravè with vanilla (reccomended by elaina) and it was amazing.  Also the 8 am crepe and he loved it. Said it was filling but light and didn't leave him feeling yuck.   I got the chai latte with almond milk (love that they have alternative milk options) and it was delicious.  I also got the Gluten free omega crepe and substituted the feta for goat cheese and let me tell you it was delicious. I love that they have organic spinach, that's a plus for me.   We will definitely be returning and become regulars at this precious local crepe spot! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I tried Royal Café & Creperie recently and found it to be quite good. I'm not a crepe person at all. I thought they were kinda of dessert only food. Anyways, I tried the chipotle chicken. It had good chipotle flavor but I'm not a fan of lettuce being added and heated up. It goes limp. Plus, I wasn't sure the best way to eat it, just pick it up or use a fork. Now, the dessert crepe was awesome. I tried the banana, peanut butter & Nutella crepe. Fantastic! Overall it was a good experience. Pricey for sure. 4 crepes and two waters with tip came out to $42 and that's on a paper plate with plastic forks and knives. I'll be back for more dessert."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, very welcoming, will return.  Food was fresh, service was prompt, and it's a great local experience."}
{"text":"Dropped by 15 minutes before closing. Super nice folks there.  Had the pumpkin desert crepe (delicious) and some georgia peach tea (also great).  Definitely going back to try breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Delish!!!   A little pricey for a crepe but quality makes it worth it! xo Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing Drinks and Food! They have a large selection of loose leaf teas and freshly made drinks. I'm a huge chai latte fan and in my opinion, they make the best. They actual steep the tea and make the latte. Not the best service but not bad either. They just aren't the usual southerners you'll see around here. The crepes are fantastic and everything is great."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmm. The end.   We ordered the mexican, blt, smores, and 8am crepes (family of 5) and had MORE than enough food. Coffee was on point too. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Would highly recommend this place. The crepes are amazing and all breakfast and lunch crepes are offered all day. Service is fantastic. The place itself is small, but you can take your order next door of needed or out on the small patio. Fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the owner Ileana (hope I spelled her name correctly) greeted me warmly , asked if It was my first time and took me under her wing once I said yes and broke down the whole menu to me . I decided on ultimately (pictured)-Hamster Breakfast Crepe: eggs | cheddar cheese | bacon | mushroom & brown sugar espresso and it was all fantastic!"}
{"text":"The gyro crepe is amazing! All of the ones I've had have been delicious. Everything is made fresh in front of you. Easier to get food to go because the place is so small."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently and not only is the staff super friendly and sweet, the crepes are AMAZING! I had the special of the day - a chicken, spinach, avocado, and raspberry chipotle sauce. Love that a unique restaurant and lovely tea bar is in downtown Matthews."}
{"text":"I'm loving Matthews right now!  They are growing and bringing in some incredible local restaurants, shops, bars, etc.  This place was very good, clean and has a great menu.  I tried the strawberries and cream crepe.  It was strawberries, fresh/real whipped cream with nutella.  Need I say more?  It was awesome!!  I just wish it had a little more filling.  I took a few bites of just crepe with very little nutella so that was a little annoying but other than that..it was awesome.  The strawberries were super fresh!!  I think it is pretty hard to botch anything that has strawberries and nutella involved so I look forward to trying one of their savory crepes.    The service was friendly, the place is rather small and the lighting is super bright...so I think it is ideal for lunch or brunch.  There is nothing really inviting or warm about the atmosphere...it actually makes you want to get out of there as quick as possible.    Looking forward to trying more---s'mores, banana butter, peanut butter and jelly, etc.."}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the atmosphere and the food was delicious. Such a great place. The tea was amazing, and I love how they present it to you. You can't go wrong with any crepe you select, and watching them make it makes it even more scrumptious. My new regular \"go to\" spot in Mathews,NC"}
{"text":"Location, service and tea were great. So two stars for those. I really wasn't impressed with the crêpes though, which is a shame cause I love those. I usually find a creperie anywhere I travel, and this one is nothing to write home about.  You do have lots of choices of fillings, but I'm not sure if that helps much.  Sitting space is limited."}
{"text":"A really good dessert crepe place in Matthews.  I agree with other reviews on 2 things: price is a bit high and hard to eat the crepe with plastic fork, knife, and plate. I have never order any sandwich crepes so don't know if they are any good."}
{"text":"I thought I had previously written a review about this restaurant.  I LOVE the food!  You can't go wrong with a crepe.  It is less filling than bread and is made fresh based on your order.  It is fun to watch the prep and actual cooking of the crepe.  When you can make it the way you want it, how can you go wrong.  Some of the additions will cost you $.25 and up, but I usually don't need anything else with mine.  I always go for the Smokey Chipotle Chicken and the Carmel Apple Pie (it smells like heaven).  On my hungry days, I will eat the entire crepe.  On my not-so-hungry days, I will eat half of mine and then half of a dessert crepe!  The staff are great as well.  They also server gluten-free crepes."}
{"text":"Love this little spot! The owners are very passionate and friendly and every crepe is made custom right in front of you with whatever ingredients you choose. Big portions and lots of options. Only downside is very tight seating as it gets crowded. Hope to see them continue to flourish!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes. I had the chicken and broccoli crepe and a peach cobbler crepe, they both were very tasty."}
{"text":"Happy to have found this place! Genuinely friendly service, very rare these days. Best salted caramel latte ever. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places to go! Alexis is a fantastic owner and knows so many of the patrons on a first name basis. It's relaxing and the food is yummy and consistent.  Get the TBC crepe for dinner and a S'Mores crepe for dessert.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service! Yulia is a gem. Very friendly and personable. Food was delicious. Try the Mediterranean crepe. I had mine with avocado and I will definitely have it again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best crepe I have ever had. The \"roast beast\" was amazing. Great tea and coffee selection. Extremely nice owner and staff.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Closed Monday's. Did not get to try this place until Tuesday. I had the Cordon Bleu crepe and my wife had the Bacon/turkey/egg crepe. Both were tremendous. Mine had the perfect blend of ingredients and honey mustard sauce.   If I had to find a suggestion, get bigger plates for these monsters. We wanted to try a dessert crepe but were too full. Need to return soon."}
{"text":"Woot Woot!  Downtown Matthews has been changing a lot recently.  The newest addition to the block is the Royal Cafe & Creperie!  This place has been on my radar the past couple of months, but I've never had an excuse to go and try it (other than my supreme love of breakfast foods).  I did get to do \"breakfast for dinner\" when I was hanging out at the Beer Temple next door and needed something to munch on.  My breakfast crepe dinner made such an impression on me that I made it a point to visit again during the weekend (twice!!)  Once on Saturday, and then another time after my long 10mile run on Sunday.  Each time I got to try a crepe that had exciting, fresh ingredients and made with a lot of love and care.  The owners always gave me a warm welcome and recognized that I had been coming in frequently.  We talked about running and my favorite part is watching them work their magic on the crepe griddle.  It's almost an art, pouring the batter and whisking the trowel 360 degrees (don't think this is the proper terminology and tool names) to make a perfectly thin and light vessel for the goodness that are your fillings.  They have a number of set menu items, but the great thing is that you can customize and make your own!  Located on the new \"main drag\" near the Library/Town Hall - I hope this place definitely stays a while.  I plan on doing my part and having breakfast here as many chances as I can get!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and am so glad I did!  Not only is their food delicious, they also offer gluten-free options!  I built my own with eggs, cheese, and veggies, and it was fantastic.  It's a small shop and the ladies who work there are really nice and make you feel welcome.  I'm planning on going back sometime this week for more!"}
