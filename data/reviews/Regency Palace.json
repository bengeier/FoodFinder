{"text":"Yummy dim sum, but make sure you grab the spring rolls if you see them because you'll never see them twice! Great to have the express station, takes some of the waiting game out of the dim sum experience."}
{"text":"Great food great service! Buffet is best in town same with fondue but it's only during the winter season. Dim sum is good too no place like it where they come around with the food."}
{"text":"Montreal could learn from the quality of this dim sum palace. It was the best I have had in 20 years.  Freshly made; just amazing. Can't wait to get back there again.  Service five star. There were 4 of us on a Friday afternoon after the buffet closed; not a problem; they delivered everything we ordered to our table in good time."}
{"text":"Dim sum is adequate here.  The place is large and can accommodate during busy times.  It's a good choice when other dim sum places are all full."}
{"text":"First time I've had dim sum since I was in Hong Kong this summer. My overall experience was pretty good. Nothing fancy and nothing new. Everything I was looking for was available. The quality of the food good. The service was good. The washrooms were fine. I still think the value for dollar is quite decent. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible buffet- HotPot is ok- service is BAD

Buffet selection and taste is so bad. Hotpot was okay, but the servers were so rude and they don't even offer you drink or see how you're doing. I'm a server and there wasn't any \"service\" in that place at all."}
{"text":"Good place in downtown for Dim Sum. Overall pretty standard experience, nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"My family loves dim sum & Regency Palace is our favorite place to go.  You can argue that it may not be the best place for dim sum in Calgary but there are definitely some perks:
1. It is HUGE so you can walk in at noon on Saturday with 8 of your closest friends & you'll still likely get a table with no wait.
2. It has carts and a steam table full of their most popular dim sum items.  If the chicken feet have passed for the fifth time & you want something else just go up to the steam table with your ticket and take your dishes back to your table.

Today there were 7 of us and we were stuffed and the bill came out to $15 per person including tax and tip.  Woot!"}
{"text":"Hot Pot anyone, this is some serious all you can eat buffet hot with choice of two soup base. The best part is you cook it the way like plus you get to create your own dipping sauces. There is lots to choice from you can also pick from regular buffet if you are eat hot pot but who care about that. I have uploaded photos there some photos that they ran out of food but I did not want to wait for it my food comes first. Lol. We all really enjoyed the food there. Service was good too. Full bar."}
{"text":"We went here for my daughters birthday as she wanted a buffet and the reviews for this place seemed good. When we arrived no one was at the front area so we waited for a bit and a lady then waved us down no welcome etc. we then headed over to get food, the selection was much smaller than I anticipated, when eating I found the food very dry like it had been sitting for awhile or was overcooked......I was disappointed and will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"This review is loooong overdue. I've been eating here with family and friends...and their families for years. Dim sum, fondue, buffet - Regency has it all and does it all extremely well. 

This large venue also fantastic for meetings as they have several private rooms off the main dining rooms. The stage at the rear is ideal for large functions and the room can be segmented further for smaller functions. Personally, I've been here for fundraisers, Christmas parties, and the Sien Lok Society's Chinese New Year Party (which is by far the most elaborate and extravagant \"do\" of the new year...not to be missed!).

If I were to pick favorite dishes, I'd say that the Peking duck is always outstanding. They also do a wonderful scallop dish for banquets that I don't know the name of, but it always makes my eyes light up. It is savory and slightly sweet and oh-so wonderful.

For dim sum, well, I can't live without my lotus-leaf wrapped sticky rice, ha gow and shaomai! It's so great to have the carts circulating and continuously have food brought to you at will. After years of eating dim sum, the novelty still hasn't worn off! 

The fondue (hot pot) is also such a treat and there is a wonderful selection of meats and vegetables to add to the broth. Don't even get me started on the buffet...it's delicious.

All I have to say is come hungry and bring friends...lots of them!"}
{"text":"I found Regency Palace through Yelp, after trying to go to Silver Dragon with a huge lineup. I felt like I was just too hungry to wait, so we walked over to Regency Palace. Initially, it seemed like a good move, because the pork and shrimp dumplings were on par with other dim sums, but after that, every dish was disappointing. My guy friend ordered beef and pork ribs, and some other BBQ beef with a really strange sweet sauce on it - all of them were a little yucky. I ordered the sticky rice, totally bland in comparison to Silver Dragon. Salt and pepper squid was ok, as were the pork buns, but after several dishes being less than tasty, we started to lose our enthusiasm to try anything else. I left regretting my lack of patience for better food. Next time I'll wait in line for Silver Dragon."}
{"text":"Buffet was not bad but 5 stars goes for great Hotpot:

Many broths to choose from
Tons of meat cuts
Lots of seafood options
Lots of veggies
Tons of dipping sauces

Buffet included
Rapid service
Great location
Reasonable price for all you can eat buffet and hotpot

Room foe improvement:
Self serve drinks like lemonade and juice were room temp and not cold 

Broth after a while was super oily from boiled meat and seafood and not good tasting. Would be nice if we were offered refreshed new broth..."}
{"text":"Did someone say buffet?! The mere mention and my ears perk up. I had to try it. Well actually, I went with some people from work who had been there a number of times and had good things to say about it. 

It was lunchtime and the place would get busy. Since we were there early, we got to the buffet with not much of a line up. There was a good selection of items from spring rolls, ginger beef, dumplings, salt & pepper squid, fried rice, chow mien, noodles, pretty much everything you want. It was all hot, fresh, and in good supply. The service was good. Our plates were cleared quickly and our drinks refreshed too. 

The value for your money is decent and they have a nice selection of food. There is something for everyone. I'd love to come back here and try the dim sum."}
{"text":"Great service from all the people! There buffet is huge and has lots of items to chose from, there Dim sum is best! Taste great! 
They also have hotpot, the soup doesn't taste as good but they have like TONS of hotpot goodies to put in yum.

Beer for a cheap price? Thats like a bonus!"}
{"text":"Tried the pot stickers, 3/4 dough, still gooey on the inside, beef w black Bean shanghai noodles was mostly soy sauce and pretty light on the black bean sauce

2 dishes $23 seemed a little steep for lunch"}
{"text":"My buddy recommends Regency for hot pot. However, it was lunch, so no hot pot (dinner only).  I took a look at the buffet offering. Salt and pepper squid, fried rice, noodles, ginger beef and veggies. The food looked better than food court quality, and there was always an employee there, stirring and moving items inside the warmer. 

I opted to try dim sum, which came along in carts. The food was fresh and hot. The shrimp dumpling (how how) was gummy, the wrapper too thick. The shrimp was a meagre size and didn't taste fresh. The sou mai was MUCH better. Big and juicy, nice flavour. I also tried tripe, shrimp rice roll, and some fish/shrimp cake. 

For Calgary's downtown crowd, it's a quick option for lunch."}
{"text":"Regency does not have the best dim sum in Calgary, but is huge space, no lineup, and it is a great place to take family member who uses walkers or wheelchairs. For that it has my vote in this case."}
{"text":"Excellent place for dim sum in the middle of the mall. Took a few of my family members here for Saturday lunch. Friendly staff and the pot of tea comes to your table pretty quickly.

You have your typical pushcarts going around the place providing the dim sum foods but a bonus thing is that they have a station in the front that provides some hot griddled food as well as an area near the buffet where you can just go up and grab a lot of the commonly requested and favorite items.

We ordered a plate of beef flat noodle to share and then har gao, a scallop and shrimp dumpling, shrimp tofu cake of some sort, and a beef cheung fun. All are exemplary. The cheung fun is perfectly steamed and by that, I mean, it's firm, but held together so that it doesn't slip as you transfer it from plate to mouth. The dumplings are great too - you see real tender scallop and shrimp in there and the seafood flavor is clear. The shrimp tofu cake is a bit dry but the sauce it comes with is good. The flat noodle is not greasy, good distribution of bean sprouts, noodles with just a bit of meat. 

All in all, exemplary dim sum and wouldn't hesitate to come back for more."}
{"text":"It's always fun trying to order at the Regency Palace. In spite of this we really enjoy coming once in a while. Usually my ordering involves a lot of smiling, waving and pointing with a little bit of nodding.  After all when in Rome...

The salt-and-pepper squid are very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. One order is not enough.   Same goes for the shrimp and cilantro dumplings. They were the favorite of the whole dinner. 

Steamed shrimp and pork dumplings are very good. This time we didn't save room for the delicious sesame rolls but next time we will. 

Great place. Great experience. Great food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Skip the Dishes. The siu mai I received were raw in the middle. Not only is this disgusting, but it's dangerous too. 

Will never order from them again.

Edited to add: Skip gave me a full refund, at least. Thanks Skip!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!!!!!! The waiters are so rude and they don't give a crap about anything. If you hate your job that much go work somewhere else. If you ask for anything they pretend they don't hear you and walk away. Many weddings are held here because there the only restaurant that can handle large groups but it's not worth it. They treat your guest poorly. The restaurant is dirty and the washrooms haven't been cleaned. The food is only meh! I'd give them a negative star if I could."}
{"text":"The food its too salty and The people there they don't respect  I don't like it at all"}
{"text":"The boys and I were here for the ImaginASIAN 2014 Cultural Gala dinner on May 31.

Service was average (typical Chinese restaurant service in Calgary)--the servers did only what they were required to do (bring food to the table and clear empty plates).  Even before the first dish arrived at our table, we had to walk to the bar to replace a dirty wine glass with a clean one (as it was still impossible to flag down a server).
 
Once the emcees made their introductions, the food started to come out fairly quickly.

1. House special combination cold platter:  duck, ham, jellied beef, sliced spiced jellyfish with cilantro garnish.  We're off to a good start here!
2. Scallops and abalone mushrooms with vegetables:  the whole dish was flavorful; the sugar snap peas were tender-crisp.  The addition of more carrots could have made the plate more colorful (apart from the green from the sugar snap peas, everything else was white and beige).  
3. Braised duck with taro:  this was an amazing dish!  The duck was tender and the sauce complimented the taro and duck perfectly(not too salty).   
4. Supreme crabmeat fishmaw soup:  there were generous portions of fishmaw and crabmeat in this soup.  Yum.
5. Creamy lobster with noodles:  ahhh, heaven...  There's nothing like the combination of fresh lobster, noodles, and cream sauce.  
6. Crispy chicken with onion in soy sauce: a delicious variation from the regular crispy chicken with shrimp chips.  The chicken meat was tender, but not as juicy as the chicken in Ho Won.
From here onwards, things started to go downhill...
 7. Stuffed bean curd with shrimp paste with vegetables: there was a substitution in the menu here.  We were served dow mew (pea shoots/greens) with whole garlic cloves.  A bit oily, but delicious!  Oiliness is nothing a good cup of tea can't fix.   
8.  Special steamed pickerel with ginger and green onion: what, no pickerel available?!?  The substitution was battered fried fish fillets (which tasted like basa, an inexpensive Vietnamese catfish) in a sweet and sour sauce. The fish was drowning in the batter (many customers left this dish unfinished).  Well, I guess I shouldn't complain much--it could have been tilapia...  
9.  Seafood and pineapple fried rice: rather uninspiring and utterly bland.  I would even go so far to say that the kitchen cut corners and diluted the dish with more rice.  It was mostly steamed white rice with hardly any seafood or pineapple in it.
10. Seasonal fruit and special cookies:  I'm not a big fan of Chinese desserts, but there was a very interesting pink marshmallow-like coconut jello (well, it tasted like a marshmallow, but not as sweet!) and fried cookies with sesame seeds (I would've preferred eating an almond cookie).   \"Seasonal fruit\" was the restaurant's term for sliced oranges.
      Overall, Regency has some good dishes.  Some of the other dishes were way out in left field though."}
{"text":"Expensive and not yummy Chinese food. If you are Asian, this is NOT the Chinese restaurant for you. Everything is very salty. The price for the food (dim sum or order dishes) is more like $$$. The waiter /waitress here doesn't speak fluent Mandarin, or Cantonese or English. So be prepare to be able to say 3 different language when order food or ask for drinks. They also don't smile and seems very inpatient. Good luck trying to wave them down."}
{"text":"Today I happened to go to this place for lunch with 15 ppl. I was really confused for coming to this place as this was my first chinese restaurant that I visited in calgary. I like Chinese food but as I am only a chicken and sea food lover, after finding so many other items here(like Eel as I checked on menu) I was in the impression that I had to find out some other place to fill my stomach. However, all my illusions were overcome by the amazing varieties in food. 

We chose to go for buffet and there were a lot of varieties and choices. Starting from appetizers,main course till desserts, there were wide variety of options. 

Pros  - They have a big place that can handle a big crowd.
Appetizers : soup, chicken finger, fish finger, chicken spring roll, onion rings, etc.. lot many that I tasted. Also there were many options for beef and pork and heard from frnds that they were delicious too.

Main course : there were 3 different types of noodles. All 3 tasted good with plum sauce and shrimp curry.  There were 3 varieties of sauce. There were many other varieties too in chicken,beef and pork but I didn't try them as I was saving some space for the desserts. 

Desserts: There were many flavors in icecream that we could select from, and fresh cut fruits - watermelon , musk melon,etc. Also they had jellys bt i didnt try that.

Cons :  The cake piece didnt really taste good. Didnt seem like a fresh one. 
Be cautious of vegetarian items, if you are a veggie( nt even egg) then you have to worry abt few items. Like veg-fried rice - it has egg in it but still called as veg-fried rice :P .

Funny : After we finished with our buffet, we were given some small packets one each. It was written as a fortune cookie. We had to break that and check out a small slip in it on which a fortune will be written. Ain't that sound funny. First time I am seeing this in a restaurant.

Overall - a good place to try !!!"}
{"text":"Selection is abundant. Food is delicious. Try the fondue for dinner. $2.75 beers?! Dim Sum is always nice. In a rush? There lunch buffet is huge!"}
{"text":"If you're in a bind for quick dim sum and all the other restaurants are full, Regency is the place to go. This is one large restaurant that can accommodate a lot of people. 

Having said that, the food here is mediocre at best and more often than not, quickly slapped together for the mass guests. The dim sum is sloppy with very little care to the cooking techniques so critical to each morsel of yumminess. Some of the items were over cooked while others were undercooked or lacked a depth of flavor. 

Like I said, unless you're in a pinch, I'd pass on Regency as there are many other good dim sum restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"I love this place for dim sum, hot pot and traditional Chinese dinner. The service is really good too. The dim sum has a lot of good varieties too. If you don't know the name of the dim sum dish, they show you ahead of time in the cart to ensure it's what you had in mind."}
{"text":"Went in to have the Buffet, and ended up getting the Hot Pot! WOW what a treat. Fair price, Fair service."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, but not many places are good downtown China town."}
{"text":"A visit to the Regency Palace feels a little decadent right from the beginning. I mean, it was designed that way. You step onto the top floor of Dragon City Mall where it was located into the truly beautiful lobby area. It is lush, a bit like a garden, and you cross over a small bridge that spans a koi pond. With that grand entrance to set the stage, you step out into the massive dining room. 

The dining room is all one room, but the square footage must be huge and it is split into smaller sections. If you are going for dim sum (which is what I mostly do), you are taken to the section that is the furthest back. The thing I like about the Regency Palace is that it does feel a little decadent and royal. It has a grand atmosphere.

In terms of lunch and/or dim sum, regency palace is where I bring picky people and large groups. At lunch time, there is also a lunch buffet that suits people who aren't as adventurous or who don't like dim sum, with more traditional chinese food (and western chinese food) fare.

The dim sum itself is quite good but not spectacular. The sheer size of the room means that by the time the cart gets to you, the food has often gotten a bit cold. If you can finagle a good spot by the kitchen doors, this isn't such a problem. I find that the staff is very accommodating and if they have room they do their best to fulfill that request. At the end, you have to take your scantron dim sum sheet to one of the payment stations that are a little bit difficult to find. 

You know, I've never had a bad experience at the Regency Palace. It is always consistent in service and food quality, and while it doesn't fit the bill as my top dim sum restaurant, it is my old faithful. And I love to make an entrance, so that is definitely ok."}
{"text":"Took my 12 member family to eat here last weekend, and there were 6 very large wanting to eat men in the group.  I couldnt believe that they could actually say they were full. We must have ordered over 30 dinsum dishes here.

Service was slow, so most of the time we got up and went and got things ourselves, its okay my one cousin is a pro at this.

In the end it cost me around 130 bucks which made me very happy, what infuriated me was the 16 dollar parking bill outside in the back of the Dragon Mall.  We could have had another 4 plates for that amount.

Regency Dimsum  amazing, parking in the parkade out back SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"We love the food and service here.  If you're setting up an event, book a private room and have Jack set up the details for you.  They always treat us like family here and the venue is large enough you won't have to wait in the lobby for a table.  Try the Peking Duck!"}
{"text":"Regency Palace is a Chinese dim sum and buffet restaurant located inside Dragon City Mall in Calgary's Chinatown district. Open from 10-10 every day, it's a spacious room that gets fairly busy during lunch and dinner hours, but nowhere near capacity levels. The décor is simple and a tad outdated, while the atmosphere is typical of a buffet, with hordes of diners that span all ages and demographics. I visited during their weekday lunch buffet and found the service to be just okay. My server seemed uninterested in her job and lacked basic serving skills - once my water was filled as I had started eating, she never came back to refill it until I was ready to pay the bill. 

The price of the buffet was fair and slightly cheaper than at Buffet Yangtze, where I had dined a few weeks before. Don't let the price fool you, however, as the food is not nearly as good when it comes to quality and taste. For a place that deems themselves a \"seafood restaurant\", their seafood selection during the lunch buffet was slim. I did enjoy the chicken drumsticks, the pork, and the wide noodles here quite a bit, but found many of the items far too greasy or just bland in taste. I didn't try their dim sum selection, so I can't comment on that. Of worthy note - a lady near me ordered a Rum & Coke and had to call the server back because there was no alcohol in the drink. 

If you're in Chinatown and want to drop under $20 to stuff your face with a myriad of different foods, this place might be a top contender. However, if you're serious about real Chinese food and don't want to leave with oil stains on your shirt, you're much better off exploring Chinatown for something more refined!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum at lunch??!!  Ok I might be the last person in the city to discover this but I am pretty excited that I did!! They have two options, lunch buffet and of course the amazing carts that go around filled with deliciousness!  Steamed pork, steamed shrimp, steamed riced, it is all quite amazing.  The great thing is it was super quick.  So a quick walk down the street if you are working downtown and want something different for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the decor when I arrived at the restaurant as it looked classy.  We were greeted and seated quickly.  They had a buffet that included western Chinese food including chicken balls, spring rolls, ginger beef, and sweet and sour pork.  But also the non deep fried dishes including chicken and green bean, vegetables, and black bean mussels.  There was also smoked salmon wrapped around cucumber that was quite refreshing.  There is also another buffet line for the hot pot.  First you can choose from about 7 different types of broths.  The items for the hot pot include vegetables, tofu, fish, fish balls oysters, shrimp, lamb, and pork.  There are also about 10 different sauces.  It's great because there is so much variety and you can meet the tastebuds of everyone in your party.  There's also a selection of desserts if you have room.  I had the cantaloupe and it was very sweet and a great finish to the meal, as was the fortune cookie.  For $17, I was impressed with the food quality, selection, and service.  I will definltely be back."}
{"text":"Sigh. It was too good to be true.

When at a banquet not too long ago, I noticed that the quality of the food seemed to have gone a bit downhill. I had heard that the restaurant changed hands, but that shouldn't have affected standards, or was I being naiive? 

At that banquet, well...

- the fish wasn't properly de-scaled... having to spit out scales as you're eating really isn't all too palatable;
- shrimp dishes were basically overdone.  It wasn't tender, it was tough;
- is there a premium for rice requests?
- I was served the wrong dishes, and even given extra dishes (we tried to alert the resto as we didnt order it, and did not want to be charged for stuff we didn't even want).  But admittedly they redeemed themselves by knocking off the wrong stuff and so on.  

These were the big things, but really, in the end, while the rest of the food was ok, it just wasn't, well great. I might still give it another shot, since I really want to host a chinese banquet meal one more time before Xmas for my friends and I. 

Ever since I moved to Calgary, this place has been my fall back position when it came to dim sum and large banquet meals.  The food has been good is not legendary, everyone has always enjoyed it, and there was rarely any problems.  Now... hmm... hard to say.

I've yet to go back for Dim Sum lately, so they might still redeem themselves hopefully.

#UPDATE 5 in Yelp's 30-Day Review Challenge"}
{"text":"Went for Hot Pot for the first time anywhere.  It was Really good.  They have the buffet and hot pot for supper, so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for dinner. Ordered the szeshuan shrimp, bean sprout chow mein, and beef hot plate. Chow mein was very good and flavourful, but the other dishes fell way flat. The Shrimp had no flavour, just a little bit of heat and the beef hot plate was extremely salty. 2 extremes. Service could be a little bit more coordinated and better - we had about 5 ppl ask us if we were ready to order in about 4 mins of sitting down.. attention is good... but too much definitely made us feel rushed to make our selections."}
{"text":"Dim sum was good and service was quite attentive.  You can choose between the lunch buffet or a la carte dim sum.  We went with the dim sum where you can order off of their push carts or if you wanted something specifically you can order directly from a waiter.  This was our first time here and overall the experience was excellent.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"I can't believe there are so many good reviews on this place, maybe we came on an off day or something, but I will never go back. We sat for 10 minutes, had tea dropped off, no one asked us if we wanted anything different to drink...Another 15 minutes went by...a new server came over and finally took our dim sum sheet. We waited around another 30-40 minutes where we noticed every other table around us was visibly annoyed from waiting and receiving barely any service. We saw another table complain and another walk out by this point. Every table around us was covered in dirty dishes. We then talked to a supervisor who told us \"its lunch, a lot of us are on break..\" It was not busy and they had so many staff on! By the time we finally had the nerve to leave our food came, and being decent people we stayed and payed for it."}
{"text":"I've haven't been to the Regency for such a long time 'cos parking was always a problem.  We parked at the back as the restaurant suggested but for dinner on a weekend.  The trick is to wait till 5 p.m. so that you get the evening rate of $4/- and then the restaurant will validate your 1/2 of the parking receipt (the other half is in your car) and you get back $4!  

This past Saturday evening we decided to try Regency and celebrate almost the end of Chinese New Year celebrations with a nice hotpot dinner.  Regency has hotpot deals for adults $21.95 per person.  Check out their website.  

Their all-you-can-eat hotpot comes with a choice of 2 soups in a divided metal pot on a propane burner if your table has 4 or more persons.  If there is less than 4 persons, you only get a choice of 1 soup.  The soup could be a clear broth soup or a spicy one.  We opted for clear broth soups - Chinese Wine & Herb and Chicken and Ham broths.  

Next, you get your raw food items from the designated buffet sections.  One section is all raw food itmes like beef, lamb, pork, chicken, fish, fishballs, beefballs, prawn balls, oysters, mussels, squid, congealed pork blood, pork liver, pork kidney and prawns dressed and undressed.  On a separate table by the wall, you have your noodles or all kinds, mushrooms - enoki, shitake, tofu, fish cake, vegetables - tong oh, spinach, romaine lettuce, watercress, beancurds, black fungus and more fishballs.  Also, there's a selection of sauces for you to choose from.  Don't forget the preserved bean curd sauce (fu yee) for your lamb - in fact, it goes great with everthing!   [There is also uncooked eggs for you; some Chinese like to put raw egg into their bowl and put whatever sauce and beat up the egg.  Once the item is cooked in the soup, they will dunk it in the egg sauce and let it cool the food off and then eat it.  I don't do that.   Or you can be inventive with the egg in the soup...]

Now, comes the meal itself.  You sit at your table with the soup on high boil and you toss your raw food items into the soup and wait for it to cook.  You then fish out your food with your trusty little steel net!  Or if you don't want your food item to run away when you're waiting, just put your food item into the net and leave it in the hot soup to cook.  It'll be there waiting for you.  Dunk your hot food item into the sauce and let it cool for a bit and just munch away!  

BTW, the price of the hotpot deal also grants you access to the cooked food buffet on the other 2 aisles.  The dessert is the best - all the wonderful Chinese hot and cold dessert soups.  

We waited till 8 p.m. to leave the restaurant as there was a contest for the hotpot goers.  Free dinner if your receipt is pulled up.  Nope, we didn't win...maybe next time.  :o)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer* I've never been for dinner just dim sum 

So now that that's out of the way this is my favourite dim sum place cause they have the buffet so instead of waiting for the trolley girls to come around you just Zip up and grab your favs! The food is always tasty. The trolley girls are never happy ever pretty sure if they smile alarms go off some where and the kill a panda! The restaurant is nice on the inside like a really big hall so when it's busy it's a lot of noise but I think that just makes the experience more fun!"}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet on the planet.  To start, the service is miserable.  My waitress saw that my water glass was empty, and just ignored it.  All of the food on the buffet was old and dry. I ended up sticking to some tofu and soup.  When you ask them if they're going to refresh the buffet,  they say \"ask my boss\" and walk away or they pretend they don't hear you.  This place is in China-town,  so I just assumed their food would be a little more authentic or of better quality.  Gross,  gross,  gross!"}
