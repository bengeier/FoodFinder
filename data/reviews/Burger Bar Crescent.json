{"text":"Went for a burger based on the Yelp! reviews. So glad we did. Burgers were cooked perfectly at medium and the bun was soft.  We had fries with one and upgraded to onion rings for the other ($3 extra) and well worth it. Both fries and onion rings were perfect. We built one burger to order and the other, mine, was the Québécois (wild mushrooms and bacon). Would come back again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Enjoyed nachos covered in mushrooms and bacon to start and then dove into our burgers, tons of flavor! Wow! Found it on Yelp and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Mac and cheese of my life! I went for the mushroom Mac n cheese and the squash Apple bacon soup! Both were delightful!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive! I felt embarrassed for them to charge that much for normal food and portion sizes. I went for the first time and with my two cousins from Germany. I'm really sad that my cousin had to pay extra to have buns on his bison burger because it was originally on a lettuce bun. I went on Burger Week to try their \"Detour burger\" and had to pay for the fries because they lowered the price by 3$ for the event...which is not a discount if they take away the fries in my opinion. I pretty much payed the same price lol burger was okay but the sack was terrible. Fries were good. Service was slow. In total it cost 60$ plus tip for 2 burgers and 3 drinks."}
{"text":"I'd heard they had the best burger, and guess what? They did.  I had the blue burger which was fantastic.  Everything was perfect about the burger, although I wouldn't mind if it was bigger. Also, it took 4 minutes for them to bring it, faster than McDonald's which was crazy. I highly recommend anyone to go there and enjoy their awesome burgers."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! Went over for lunch with a friend today and upon walking into the door was warmly greeted by the person working being the bar and seated immediately. The wait staff is phenomenal here. I eat out quite often and can honestly say service here was better than some of montreal ' finest restaurants. Not only is service friendly and prompt, they are attentive to the small things. We both ordered burgers and they were messy but DELICIOUS, choc full of fresh ingredients. Fries were perfect. Wait staff provided napkins but kept coming back every 5 minutes to pick up used napkins and drop off clean ones. That NEVER happens ANYWHERE. We never had to ask for anything! I would recommend this resto to anyone looking for casual and scrumptious food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and was seated upon arrival (we were the only ones there for awhile, but it filled up eventually). There are 2 floors to Burger Bar, the first being the main reception area and the second I imagine opens up later on in the night as Crescent fills up with party-goers and clubbers.  The menu is pretty extensive, but none of the burgers scream excitement or exoticism. We ordered the wild mushroom burger and the super sonic burger, accompanied with onion rings and sweet potato fries. The burgers  themselves were pretty good. The buns however, made them. A woman actually came into the restaurant and asked the they sell the buns! The onion rings were cut thick, and wasn't all batter- a good thing!   For vegetarians, the option to swap out the meat burger for a black bean veggie patty is available, or there is a grilled veggie portabello sandwich available on the menu.   The docked star is for the staff. They were scantily clad (it's a Sunday afternoon, not a Friday night...please put some pants on, or shorts that actually fit you) and friendly, almost too friendly, it was overbearing. Our server explained it was his first day, so I guess he was trying to impress."}
{"text":"After a disappointing dinner the prior night  at a Chinese joint we were ready for some real meat. BB didn't disappoint. Seated promptly without reservations on a Saturday night at 5 PM. Started with some big beers, great burgers and a bottle of red wine to go down with the meat. Our first try of poutine. ( Fries with gravy and cheese. Otherwise known as the Montreal blood vessel clogger).  Best burgers we've had in years. We'll back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The burgers are so tall, so surprised. I took the Hangover Burger, which contained a mini poutine, onions, a fried egg and bacon in it. It was probably the best burger I ever had. I did not dare to touch the lower bread bun, since it was all soggy due to the caramelized onions. The ambiance is great, this burger would be something to take once in a while only, because it is so heavy.  One advice, go there when very hungry! Because it will fill you up like crazy. My friend took the Quebecois burger with a side of sweet potato fries + a very spicy mayonnaise, which were delicious!   I recommend this place to anyone who loves big fat juicy hamburgers :D"}
{"text":"Overall, this was a good meal.  The server was great... extremely friendly. The food was what I expected after reading the reviews. Solid burgers, nice salads, poutine was decent. What was really poor was the first impression upon walking in. My party of four walked in on a Sunday night around 8pm. The hostess immediately said they were busy and that it would be maybe an hour, without checking a single thing. I don't recall a more condescending hostess, and I wasn't sure why. I asked if there was a wait list? No. I could make a reservation for an hour or so. Okkk. Is there a spot we could wait? Look at me like I had three heads. Looking around the restaurant there were tables close to finishing up, but the hostess seemed uninterested in getting us in the door. We left the restaurant and looked for another spot on the sidewalk right outside. As we were doing this, she turned away a three top as well. Five minutes later she came outside and said that a table had just opened up and she could seat us. We agreed, and she led us to an upstairs area that was unseen before, that was HALF EMPTY! My mind was blown. Basically the hostess was either unorganized or too lazy to check on the status of her tables. A good meal was marred by a bad first impression."}
{"text":"Great active location.  Sitting outside is really pleasant,  although smokers congregate below and if the wind is wrong,  it's like they are smoking at your table.  Menu looks great and the ingredients were quite nice.  But I  ordered medium rare and it came out medium well.  That's a killer at a burger place."}
{"text":"The Lendemain de veille Burger is the best Burger in town, combining a poutine and fried egg in a delicious burger with just a touch of truffle oil. Proud to have eaten it all!! The white Sangria is refreshing. Service is fast, and helpful. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went on a busy Friday. Nice service and good food. Service was better than food....Montreal? Enjoy, but the area is for people in their twenties. Early twenties."}
{"text":"This restaurant always has excellent services. The waiters are always very helpful and kind no matter how many different times we went there and being served by a different person. This time I took the Baba burger with a poutine as a side. The poutine was amazing! The burger was wonderful, perfect, the baba had mushrooms and had some grilled veggies in it. It was very fresh and much lighter than the other burgers i had in their menu. It is a lot less intense than the other burgers on their menu overall. I think it makes a perfect combination with the poutine as the taste of both blends so well together. I couldn't get enough of their poutine as the gravy was perfectly tasteful, not too salty just perfect. The fries were full potatoes and were fried perfectly. The cheese curds being amazingly good. I really hate cheese curds that make squeecky noises when you chew. And their cheese definitely do not do that! This is a well loved place for my lunch hours! Would not hesitate to bring anyone there and would never say no to go back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is awesome. Literally the best burger I've ever had. I also had some of my cousins Mac and cheese and it was fabulous. I was also with a party of 13 and they were incredibly accommodating. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic- very attentive and thoughtful with our young child.  Ambience was okay, moderate noise level.  The beer list lacked and tasted like lines weren't clean.  Food: Mac and cheese was good. Chicken burger was Just okay but nothing great. Salad was the worst: all lettuce. Poutine was the worst I've ever had.  All in all, the service was the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"Slowww service, ordered a soup and 2 burgers, the soup came in 45min with the burgers, how an appetizer take 45min to come, and why bring it with the main course, one of them will be cold before starting the other. The people beside us ordered wings 15min after us and their wings were there before our soup, like how it is even possible to prep wings faster than serving a soup. Server was rude, wasn't available when we needed him. Can't even say sorry for the delay or thank you when we were done, never coming back.  It's sad how this place is beautiful and the food is good, but the service suck."}
{"text":"My burger was served cold. I complained. The waitress brought it back after they just reheated it. The meat was then warm but overcooked and dry. On top of this the buns were soggy. When the waitress asked me how it was, I politely said that it wasn't good and that it was a bad idea to reheat meat. She had been nice until that point but wasn't after that. I asked to talk to the manager to tell him that I was dissatisfied with the food. He listened and just said that he'll mention it to the cooks. I had to pay the full bill and it wasn't cheap. I am done with this place."}
{"text":"The Good: Friendly staff with a bit of an edge, they have no problem expressing themselves!   The overall setting and mood of the place is pretty neat! Now the part we've all been waiting for the food! Burgers are hella tasty. Personally I had the \"Dude\" burger, which is pretty much you standard burger but with more oumph! If you are lucky enough to get a seat near the wall, you'll love how long and roomy the couches are, they provide enough room to relax and eat.  The Bad: Not sure if it was just me, but personally I felt that the atmosphere/setting was lacking in the bar aspect... It's more of a lounge than a bar. Also for the price, the burgers can be a bit more on the beefier side...  The Ugly: While the restaurant is clean, the walls could be a lot more cleaner in some areas...  Overall experience: Defiantly one of the better burger joints, in Montreal. Not the best, but would definitely recommend going here at least once."}
{"text":"Cher pour des hamburgers, mais que c'est bon! M. Personnalité était novateur"}
{"text":"Overall my experience at Burger Bar was VERY disappointing. I had called to make reservations for a Saturday night. Without knowing there was going to be a hockey night that same night. So with that in mind, I knew it was going to be busy and loud. Yet not poorly managed!  It started off bad by them not being able to find our reservation. I mentioned when I called and who I spoke with. Which those details made little to no difference to the careless hostess. So we had to sit at a table which the music was blasting in our ears and the door kept opening and closing letting the cold air in. Eventually we were moved to a slightly better table.  When ordering our meals at 8:30pm, one of our burgers weren't available. Ok, so we chose something else. When both of our meals arrived, they were well prepared, good and hot. So no complaints there. When we decided to order dessert, out of the 7 things they have in their menu, again three choices weren't available. One being a strawberry cheesecake and the other a Ben&Jerry's ice cream sundae. So we ordered the fried Mars bars. Which were good, but not great. They were clearly made in a rush. Again, disappointing! Especially on something so simple to make such as a fried Mars bar.  My overall suggestion, DO NOT go on a very busy night. Such as a night when there's a hockey game or any type of show at the Bell Centre. This restaurant clearly cannot seem to handle large crowds very well.  Not to mention that their floors both upstairs and downstairs were dangerously slippery!! Kindly dry or mop your floors and get a carpet for snowy/icy weather days."}
{"text":"This was a really great surprise. I had the Hangover Burger which comes with the poutine, fried egg and much more. If the egg runs over the poutine and the burger it is just a great meat and fixin's experience. The staff was really friendly - Kayla was a very enthusiastic sales person for the bar and she was an encyclopedia of cool things to do and visit in Montreal She led us off the tourist path to the Plateau. We walked around there the whole day.  Bottom line- great burgers and friendly staff. Go and say hey to Kayla."}
{"text":"Burger difficile à manger car trop grand en hauteur, viande bonne mais trop épaisse. Les cocktails sont ratés.  Manger un burger classique pour 35$ avec un petit cocktail, c'est beaucoup trop."}
{"text":"Poutine  is outstanding and  bourbon maple cider is a perfect fall cocktail.   Everything was great just like the other reviews say."}
{"text":"I really really love Burger Bar Crescent. I'm a vegetarian and have often been dissatisfied with the soy based veggie burgers at other restaurants. Burger Bar makes their own veggie burger and it's delicious. I also love their sweet potato fries, although find that an extra $4 to replace the regular fries by them is a bit steep.  I knocked off one star because of their food delivery. When you order a burger from Burger Bar it costs the same price and they don't give you any fries. I think they should either reduce the price or add fries, as most burger places send fries with their burger.  Beyond that I would recommend this place, it's a great atmosphere (just a fun place for young people to hang out) in a great location and the staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Burger Bar a few times in the past and always had a great experience however I was very disappointed yesterday.   For one, it was F1 weekend. Of course, we were not expecting it to be five star service seeing as it was intensely packed and noisy outside on Crescent. We entered the restaurant which was not as full as we thought it would be. The hostess asked how many people we were and my boyfriend replied 4. She immediately shook her head and said she would not have any room at all (which was odd because we did not see many people waiting upstairs or on the terrace) My boyfriend kindly replied that he did not mind waiting (this was probably due to our great past experiences there that we were willing to wait). The hostess was VERY cold and just looked at us and told us it would be a 45 minute wait (as though it would turn us off and we would leave because it was 9:15PM). We moved over to the bar area. We were seated in 15 mins so it did not take 45 minutes.   Our food was good. The spicy Jack Daniel's wings were not spicy at all. My Quebecois burger was delicious. We finished our meal and the restaurant was not so packed (there was 2 free tables near us). My boyfriend and I were super excited to have a dessert. We kindly asked the waitress for a dessert menu and she said we could not have dessert on F1 weekend. I didn't think anything of it until 3 women near us ordered the fried Mars bar. I was extremely angry. I explained to the waitress that it was very unfair to lie to us and she used some lame excuse and said that their waitress happened to be the manager and the manager had told the staff earlier that night no desserts allowed and she was essentially breaking her own rules.   She asked if I wanted to order dessert. I did not want to stay there any longer. We were ready to pay for dessert and a few more rounds. We took our money and tip somewhere it was much more welcomed. I was very disappointed and still am. I will not be going back because I feel like the staff was just annoyed with us. They were not friendly and were willing to let us go and due to bad service they just lost a regular.   I would highly recommend a change of staff. The bartenders however were extremely friendly (two women with glasses, one with shorter hair) they were great! The rest just treated us horribly."}
{"text":"Burgers are on order ~ this place does well on the Atmosphere, Service, Food scale.  Atmosphere:  Two floors, comfy casual seating, and very touristy.  Burger Bar is as its name implies, works towards being a \"bar\" that serves up shots of burgers.  The experiment fails at time due to the plethora of other \"upper-end\" burger-centric establishments in Montreal, but given that Burger Bar is on Crescent street, one of the prime destination for tourists in Montreal, the hope is that it will catch on well enough to survive.  Service:  Service is ok, but then again given the location it almost has to be.  THe staff is pleasant, but often busy and the owners / partners of the place are often on hand to engage patrons and regale them with tales of hockey and business ventures - Sam Malone of Cheers would be proud.  Food:  The food at Burger Bar is actually very good (well ... it may not exactly be good FOR you but it's good none the less!).  Given that there are several other restaurants that follow a similar business plan to Burger Bar, it loses points on originality - but this doesn't detract too much for the offerings on hand.  A big minus is the price:  the orders are a little on the small side, but the price is definitely on the high end.  It's a good place to share a meal"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal here sitting out on a small deck overlooking the scene on Crescent St. (which I liked a lot as opposed to being right on the street like some of the other places).  The food took awhile, which we were warned may be the case due to a private party upstairs.  We really didn't mind so much though because it was a nice night to be outside and the waitress kept checking on us to make sure we had whatever we needed.   There were a few specifically vegetarian items on the menu, one of which we ordered (the grilled portobello sandwich with grilled veggies).  Any of the burgers can be made with a veggie black bean patty instead, so we did that for another entree.  We had sweet potato fries with both which were great.  There was no kids menu per se, but they offered to make a small version of the mac and cheese.   I wouldn't say it's a great place to dine with kids because it's rather small and seemed quiet inside, but it worked out well for us being on the deck."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I have been to your place several times and always are very happy. But yesterday we were dissapointed. Too much tomato for example :(  we'll go back because we really like u guys, but hopefully we'll get the same burgers we've been loving for a while."}
{"text":"Now that's a burger!  Marc ordered \"Big Blue\" and Cydny \"The Dude.\" The size of these burgers are intimidating when served. The buns and toppings are placed high on top of a skewer, but do not fret the bread is light as air and soak up all the juices! The fries are top notch and would definitely eat here again when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love it here!! The owner, manager, staff...all great people!! The atmosphere is great! Its really cool and relaxed. You feel really comfortable, the food is amazing!! My favorite burger and I tried near all of them is the firestorm! If you like spicy, you'll love it! It really is one of Montreal's premire burger spots! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers, they have vegeterian option for almost all the burgers which is very rare in most of the restaurants. the best burger in montreal"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on our first night in Montreal. The food and cocktails were amazing. We sat at the bar and met the owner who was very welcoming and kind. Highly recommend this spot if you're looking for great food and drinks (I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was perfect...I wish I was hungrier as I would've liked to have tried the poutine)."}
{"text":"It was really good, service cool, space a little tight and they didnt had bison which they have a full page offering but and the end we were very well guided to pick something else."}
{"text":"We made a very brief weekend visit to Montreal just this last weekend. As we were \"walked out\" and couldn't stumble far from our hotel just down Crescent St, we used Yelp to find a nearby option for dinner. This seemed like a good choice from Yelp reviews, and it definitely was. We'll visit again when in the area. I had the Yosemite Sam, and it was awesome. My companions had the Quebecois and the italian one, whose name escapes me....both excellent according to them. It was a very busy weekend, and the restaurant is noisy, but we were very impressed with both our server, who was very pleasant and accommodating, and the other servers running up and down those stairs. They definitely must have Buns of Steel working here! Just a note for anyone with a disability...not really accessible."}
{"text":"There are a lot of burger places to choose from in town and I had yet to try Burger Bar.  I made my way down there with a couple of friends to check it out.  The ambiance of the place was nice, great looking bar (although small), and cool decor.  It is a bit small though.    The food was definitely good.  I tried my friends goat cheese and vegetable salad and I had to say it had a lot of flavor.  For the burgers there is a great list to choose from (lots of variety). I ended up getting the Supersonic Burger, which comes with three onion rings on top of the bun and jarlsberg cheese, bacon, banana peppers.  The portion was decent, plus you can choose a side salad or fries.  I chose the salad, and it was a healthy size as well.  Overall, the food is worth coming back for.  As for drinks they have a great list of classic cocktails.  However, I ordered the Dark 'n Stormy, but they were out or ginger beer :(.  I had to settle for a Negroni which was very good, but strong (the way I like it).  Service was good too."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch before walking over to Concordia University.  The servers were very professional and always available at just the right time.  I had the M. (mister/monsieur) Personality.  We also ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ and the Firestorm burgers.  We definitely wanted more poutine in Montreal so we got our fries with the poutine option.  The fries were nice, steak fry size and the gravy was tasty and warm but it was a disappointment to me since my fries weren't warm.  The cheese curds were big, fresh and squeaky.  We found the burger meat to be delicious.  We did not want to get too stuffed that day but would have loved to order shakes."}
{"text":"Very bad experience.  Never go there again!!!!  We were 3 adults and 3 kids on a Monday night in July.  The restaurant was half full.  As we walked in, we did not feel welcomed.  We sat down and gave them two Tuango coupons which allowed us to 4 main courses up to a value of 20$ each according to the fine prints on the coupons. The waiter told us that we were only allowed to 4 burgers excluding tge foie gras burger at 25$ no matter what the coupon said.  Only one burger was priced at 20$.  If we changed the side dish, we had to pay extra even if the burger was at 13$ and the side dish at 2,95$.  We waited an hour to get our food.  I got mad when a group of 9 next to us ordered 10 minutes after us and got their food 15 minutes before us.  My kids got hungry and very impatient which is very normal.  When I complained to the waiter, he did not apologize and found stupid excuses that did not make sense.  The food is awful.  The meat had too much pepper.  I took the big one with the egg, bacon and poutine inside.  The burger was so tall that the waiter dropped it on the table and simply put it back.  I didn't want to wait for another hour for a new burger so I ate it. The fun experience of eating a burger is to be able yo hold it in your hands.  if yiou want to eat your burger here, you need a fork and a knife because it is very tall.  At the end, it took another 20 minutes to get the bill and he even overcharged for a side dish.  It is very expensive.  The mensrooms are horrible.  I went in to wash my hands regretted after.  Trying a new restaurant should be a very pleasant experience. Not a nightmare like we had.  By the way, most people around us left aver half of their burgers.  They merely touched their fries which are not fresh.  Overall, a burger McD would have been better, cheaper, more friendly and a lot faster!!!  We were there at 8 pm and left st 10:30 pm.  We did not take any dessert nor coffee.  If you can't give a decent service or honor your coupons, you should close your \"shop\"!!"}
{"text":"Even though it's not listed on their menu, they will substitute a delicious homemade veggie burger for their beef burger.   There are lots of creative burgers to choose from. I had a absolutely delicious veggie burger with babaganoush, portobello, and grilled onions. My tablemates loved their poutine, mac and cheese, and burger with smoked meat.   Waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, but didn't hover.   Prices were very reasonable, especially for a hip place on Crescent."}
{"text":"Liked it a lot.  We went here for burgers and beers for dinner and would come back here again.  The beer selection is sparse but the burgers are huge and perfectly cooked and accompanied with equally large sides."}
{"text":"Très bonne découverte! Le service était très rapide et efficace alors que le restaurant était plein. La carte est bien fournie et il y a du choix. Et surtout, les burger sont excellents. Leurs frites aussi sont très bonnes, pas du congelé ! Par contre il faut avoir bien faim pour finir son assiette. J'y retournerai sans hésiter"}
{"text":"Wandering in Montreal with my wife we came across this place called Burger Bar.  Ordered a burger (of course), wife gets the mixed green salad.  Both served fresh, and the burger was one of the best I've ever had.  Juicy and grilled to perfection.  Highly recommend this place for burger connoisseurs and foodies alike!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Great burgers and drinks. Only four stars because most of the imported beers were not available this night and the waiter forgot to bring us the mayo."}
{"text":"Lovely burger!  Meat is of excellent quality, fresh buns and attentive service with a smile. The coleslaw was freshly made together with homemade fries, delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint.  If you want a tasty burger and great fries and fun food this is a great place to go. Quality of beef was really top notch. Also shared a pitcher of cider sangria---wow. Yummy.  Waited a bit for the burgers but atmosphere made it fine."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night during my trip to Montreal.  I liked that for no extra cost you can get a bean+veggie pattie substitution.  I got the plain burger and asked for avocado, just something I was craving that day. It cost $2 but they added a whole avocado to my burger, that was worth the price.  I think this dinner place is great for locals, good burger selection.  If you are traveling through Montreal, I'd skip this place because it's just another burger joint."}
{"text":"I've been here few times. Really enjoy their food and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Last time I had the baba burger and loved it. I like that the meat can be cooked to your liking. They are messy to eat but well worth the visit. I never tried the milkshakes but they look delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome good! Had the hangover burger and it was ridiculous but so good. And a fantastic homemade ceaser salad.  Best part though is the great staff. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fair prices for the high quality.  Service is also top notch. Tremendous."}
{"text":"These are the biggest, most delicious burgers we have ever eaten.  The marshmallow milkshake is delicious with Bailey's..and the presentation is gorgeous.The service was very friendly and patient (we had to send a drink back due to our own mistake.  The waitress took it with stride and didnt put it on the bill).  We will definetly be visiting again"}
{"text":"The Burger Bar has a rather extensive menu, which appealed to our group. We were seated immediately in their upstairs area, even though the restaurant wasn't very full. Unfortunately, that was about the last we saw of the wait staff. It took nearly 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order and almost another 10 before we received our drinks. In the 40 minutes it took to bring our food, our waitress never once came to check on us. When our food did come, it was delicious. Great sized portions, and perfectly cooked meat. I had the Babba Burger, and thoroughly enjoyed the stacked grilled veggies in my burger. I also appreciated that you are able to have a green salad, rather than fries. I usually don't care for hamburger buns, but these were delicious. Very hearty, and also grilled. Also a plus, I was very full after I finished. Poor service aside, I would say this is a good choice for dinner."}
{"text":"While walking the streets of Montreal, looking for a quick bite we stumbled into this Burger Joint and decided to check it out. This turned out ti be an excellent decision. They serve large delicious juicy mouth-watering burgers at a reasonable price. The service was courteous and friendly and the ambiance is cool and refreshing. Highly recommended burger joint in Montreal."}
{"text":"impressed with the great tasting burgers which are literally sky tall....to the extent that we couldnt figure out how to start working on our burgers....  i had a Baba burger which is really really good!!! theres roasted red pepper, grilled portabello & eggplant & zucchini with balsamic reduction.patty was cooked to med rare, juicy and very flavorful  service was slow on that night.. we were waiting for the food for more than half an hr.. servers are never to be seen around our table.  appetizers are not recommended .. portions are too small to share and not very well presented .but the calamari with spicy mayo is kinda good..."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER. Service was amazing!! and the food was even better! Great prices! We went on a bachelorette night and the bride got a free drink!  going back asap"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I highly recommend to anyone wanting the best burger of your life!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! It's hard to find a place that makes amazing veggie burgers, so trust me when I say that there Firestorm veggie burger was phenomenal. The service was good as well. I wouldn't really recommend going here for happy hour because they don't really have great deals but definitely a place to go for their burgers."}
{"text":"Insane burgers!  A couple of friends and I decided to stop by after an intense session at the gym. There was a line already forming outside and we were unfortunately seated at a two-person table when there was 3 of us. It was understandable though due to how busy it was.   We ordered 3 of the fanciest burgers known to mankind, 2 different kinds of poutine, onion rings, wings, and some drinks. The burgers also came with fries and a salad so needless to say, we ordered waaay too much.  The burgers were really good but, oh man, were they expensive. Also my friend had a massive chunk of cheese in his; not necessarily a bad thing but woah there cowboy.   The service was slow, I think we waited upwards of 40 minutes to get just the first batch of our order."}
{"text":"Service was really great, the waiter recommended the big blue which was DELISH. I personally like blue cheese with my meat so this was to die for. I wish they had put just a tad bit more blue cheese sauce but no complaints there. I ordered it with mixed greens, which was alright, it balanced the meal out for me. For desert I had the deep fried mars bars which also tasted yummy :) I wish they would update the menu as often as they would take items off because I wanted to try the brownie which unfortunately they did not have.  Other than that, service was decent , water was always full and staff was very personable.   Location is great, right in downtown and there are plenty of pubs or restaurants around. Parking is fairly hard to find, you would have to pay by the hour if wanted close by the place."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Montreal for burgers. The hardest thing about going to Burger Bar is deciding what to order, it's nearly impossible because the the whole menu looks sooooo GOOOD! The \"Jack Daniel\" burger is one of my favorites. The fries are also really really good, even better as a poutine.   I've been going to Burger Bar for a while now, and what got me the first time was how nice the ambiance is, it's a place where you can relax and be very comfortable. All the staff are super nice too, they give the best service and are always smiling.   I've been to a lot of different restaurants in Montreal, from the little restaurants to the 5 stars and Burger Bar is defiantly one of the best places to eat in Montreal.  Great Food. Great Service. Great Atmosphere."}
{"text":"The little cheeseburger is consistently great. A good portion size and a large variety of tasty toppings. I like munching on the peanuts in the shell while waiting for my burger to be cooked to order. Fancy soda machine allows almost any flavor. Leftover fries make great home fries with eggs the next morning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, a bit expensive but totally worth it. I had a blue cheese burger, best burger I've ever had, it was like a tower of things that I didn't even know how to it, and it was delicious. Also, amazing onion rings and you must, must try the sweet potato fries. I would definitely go there often if I didn't fear for my body!"}
{"text":"Good times and good service.  Patrons and staff were very friendly.  I would definitely recommend going there."}
{"text":"Supersonic burger was great I recommend choosing the coleslaw as sidedish.  Service was fast"}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us came here for a birthday on Friday evening.  The decor is nice - pleather booths, exposed brick walls.  The table was ready when we arrived, but it was pretty drafty being seated next to the door.   We ordered our drinks (crescent pair was good - pear vodka, mango puree, club soda..) and then our meals.  I had the supersonic, with hot peppers (yay!), pickles (double yay!), jarlsberg,  and bacon, topped with three crispy onion rings. It was delicious.  The meat the juicy (but not undercooked) and the bacon was nice and crisp. The fries were good, but not exceptional.  My boyfriend had the smoked meat burger, which comes topped with swiss cheese, pickles and mustard - it was also very good. The side salad comes with mixed greens and a nice vinaigrette - delicious! My friend has the sicilian burger which I think was the best one (of the three I tried). The burger is made of ground beef and sausage, which makes it very moist and flavourful.  It's topped with roasted peppers, mozzarella,  black olives, arugula and basil.  To make it gluten free-friendly, they wrapped it in lettuce.  The sweet potato fries were pretty good too.  Whole wheat buns are also available if you're not into white bread.   Everyone at the table really enjoyed their meals.  The only issue was the slow service  - it took an hour after ordering to receive our meals.  Tables of two who ordered after us were served much more quickly."}
{"text":"On. M. G.  I have traveled extensively throughout the world.  This is by far the best burger I have ever had in my life.  Amazing staff,  Awesome prices. Great ambiance.  If you are looking for an amazing burger and fries,  this IS the place."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasant chance to check this resto out while I was in the area. I ordered the fried calamari, and though it was good, I've had better. I went for the Mr. Personality burger with cheese, and it was quite juicy, but the beef patty was lacking in salt.  Lately I've been obsessing with pecan pie and couldn't resist when I saw it on their menu. I used the Yelp 50% coupon (dessert only) and it was worth it. The pie itself wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of Jack Daniels, along with vanilla ice cream. My only issue with the pie was that the crust was very hard to break. My spoon wasn't helping much, I had to use a knife!  Service was very quick and friendly.  The only restaurant that I didn't have to ask for a refill for my water, that's how quick they were!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We had the Jack Daniel's BBQ burger and the Goodfella burger. The coleslaw was amazing... It even rivals St. Hubert's coleslaw! Our server was very pleasant. Nice décor!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the best customer service I've experienced at a restaurant. The burgers are absolutely fantastic and a very nice size and juicy. Actually I'd eaten only half of one and was quite full. I'm looking forward to eating there again. I had to send my burger back because it wasn't cooked well, but there wasn't any fuss and the burger came back better the second time around. Worth many visits."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my group of amigos, I had the boss burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Service is a class act, and were very nice. Highly recommend! - Wom"}
{"text":"Wicked good burgers, extremely friendly staff, The poutine was amazing. One of the better places to stop in for a quick filling lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch on Saturday and the place was packed. Several times they turned people away for lack of tables. The service was terribly slow. 30 minutes before they took my order for food or drink. Another 30 for the food to come. The poor guy next to me at the bar ordered at the same time but had to wait a full 50 minutes for his chicken burger.   The menu looks amazing, but they didn't have my first choice. I ended up with the Royal With Cheese and was very disappointed. The patty was dry and the other ingredients were unexciting. The fries were limp.  I won't be going back to pay nearly $20 for an average burger and lousy service."}
{"text":"So many things to love about this place! Great atmosphere, great service and most importantly great food.  It was really hard to decide what to order here because everything on the menu sounded very well thought out and original. I went with the BigBlue Burger which was so different and delicious. I had coleslaw on the side.  Everything is made in house and it shows. I will be back there again to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Restaurant/pub plutôt sympa, le décor est agréable, la carte aussi, les employés sont sympas et à l'écoute sans être dérangeant.  La nourriture est bonne, c'est pas exceptionnel mais c'est très loin d'être mauvais! Bonne place donc"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I had! It was so big I didn't know how to eat the whole thing. But I did! :D I had the boss burger after the server recommended it to me for a first timer. They have a very nice patio. On a sunny day in Montreal go have a cold beer ad enjoy a burger on the patio :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Blue Burger and the Spicy Poutine, and both were fantastic.  The beef patty was thick, soft, and cooked exactly as I had requested.  The burger came stacked at about 10 inches so it took me a while to crunch the numbers and figure out how I was going to eat it, but once I figured it out all the flavors came together nicely and probably ranks in my Top 5 all-time best burgers."}
{"text":"Love this place- always my go to when I'm in the mood for elevated comfort food! The place itself is cute, nothing special but the lighting gives good ambience, the staff is nice and don't forget about you, and obviously the food is good! Great burgers with a pretty insane selection, but if I'm honest I usually come here for the mac & cheese (specifically the wild shroom one-which is supposed to be an appetizer but it's so filling), it's super cheesy and creamy and just super delicious! The drinks are a little pricey but otherwise totally affordable place and worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Good price for a burger! Poutines were a good big portion as well. I would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"On our second night on Montreal, we tried the Burger Bar. Camelia, our waitress rocked! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, fast and very friendly.  The food was superb, one of the best burgers I've ever tried. The hamburger patty was very flavorful.  Drinks. I had the beer LA FIN DU MONDE, it's actually good, first it feels like rotten but then it get's better, I am pretty sure after 3 beers you forget about the rotten aftertaste.     Overall, my really picky wife said going back is a no brainer."}
{"text":"I've now been 4 times and I know I'll keeping coming back.  The service is excellent, the food great & mom & I love the casual atmosphere. We've enjoyed everything we've ordered."}
{"text":"Pas convaincue par le Burger AAA bacon mais mon compagnon s'est régale avec le Burger Poutine ! Je pense revenir pour faire un meilleur choix. Le service était tout de même très agréable et l'endroit très sympathique."}
{"text":"Cocktails were great, burgers were amazing, staff was super friendly and helpful. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"Good quality for Crescent street, the burger varieties are well thought out.  I had the supersonic burger and it was delicious. Also the poutine burger is worth getting just to be able to look at it! it is about 12inches tall, good service and prices were really reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is good, clean and not too expensive. They were very accommodating to changing toppings."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!!! Family friendly and great service and food. Try something different each time but save room for dessert....they are to die for as well!! You won't be disappointed.   The boys 17&11 got vanilla and chocolate milkshakes the first time. Both said they were creamy and yummy. We tried the Jack Daniels Bbq and spicy Jack Daniels wings the first time. They were great and super hot (with heat, not too spicy...just right). I had the white sangria. First time having a sangria made with tequila. It was great.   Second time around the 17 yo and I tried the bison burgers. I had the super cheddar.....delish !! He enjoyed his burger with bacon, but don't remember it's name. The youngest had the chicken nachos and they were fantastic (yes, I tasted---quality control).   Desserts: s'more cake was omg delicious. And we also had the 3 chocolate chip cookies with ice cream. All were great!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite to eat with a fun atmosphere. First - they played 90 throwbacks and I was instantly hooked. We got there at the right time and were able to grab the last table downstairs available. We got Poutine to start which was soooo tasty. The fries weren't overly fried or heavy and there were delicious cheese curds mixed in. My burger was perfectly cooked and loved the side of onion rings. Service was attentive and I would gladly return next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food came quickly, made with fresh ingredients & was delicious! The service was good & the food was up quickly. Would definitely return/recommend."}
{"text":"My first experience at burger bar wasn't memorable. I gave it a second chance and boy it did not disappoint. My entire meal was great. Started with the onions rings, then took the boss burger. Bacon and egg on a burger cooked to perfection. The other highlight were the drinks. The barmaid made an excellent mojito and long island ice tea. Great job Camelia."}
{"text":"overall, you get what you pay for. the burgers are more expensive than average - but they are worth it. staff is friendly and attentive. i've been four times - twice with friends from out of town - they were impressed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat a mouthwatering burger. The burger are small but full of flavor. The staff is very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"What's with Yelpers and their over the top review? This place is not that good. To be honest, I'd rather have saved my time and money and go to McDonald's. It's located in the touristy part of Montreal and it feels like a tourist trap.  The waitress was helpful but the food is just bad. My friends and I ordered the highly recommended burger(the name slips my mind at the moment) and some wings. It took almost 30-40 mins before we received anything. The worst is when you see people who came in later get their orders before. When the burger came, it was flat and the burger over-done. The wings were with Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. Just one word: BAD!  Yelper's better stop giving out those 5 stars so easily.   Stay away and save your money!"}
{"text":"Fantastic gormet burgers, i was brave enough to try their hungover burger. What monster delicious, messy , and fresh. Only one problem when you try to order take out , the place is constantly busy so it inconvenience them to serve you. But reccommended for dining."}
{"text":"Delicious wholesome burgers, just be ready for the quantity that comes with the quality!"}
{"text":"Me and friends came out to Montreal for our friends bachelor party.  After hearing that this burger joint was phenomenal we decided to make sure we have our last meal here.  I am so glad that we did.  The food was absolutely amazing.  I definitely ate a lot more than I should've but it was too good to resist. I had a hot and spicy poutine and a delicious burger.  The prices here are very reasonably priced and the portions are pretty decent.  I can definitely guarantee that you won't leave this place still hungry.  One of my my favorites parts of this city was that me and friends got to sit out on the balcony.  It came with a beautiful view and it only got better with a very pleasant staff serving us.  I cannot wait to come back here."}
{"text":"The good: all the reviews I saw said that the burgers were awesome!  The bad: spend $80 on taxi rides (round trip, 2 nights in a row) and was told that the restaurant was closed- even though Yelp & Google say they are still open.  The ugly: shout out to the employee that said I should have called a ahead. (If you could only see the side eye I have. I called yesterday and this morning. Funny how when I show up before the closing time that the employee gives me over the phone... How they are closed when I get there. Why would I waste another $40 on taxi rides?!)  Tip: order delivery."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas un secret, j'ai une préférence pour les endroits intimes, plus réservés, indépendants etc...Vous pardonnerez mais la rue Crescent et moi ce n'est pas le fol amour. Toutefois, je dois dire que passer ce petit moment bien fun avec quelques Yelpeurs à déguster un bon burger, cela fait la différence. J'ai choisi le burger aux champignons sauvages: très bon. C'est toujours bon de profiter de l'happy hour pour une petite réduction sur la bière. Je recommande ce bar à burger. XX"}
{"text":"We found this place by chance... The waitress are very friendly... The Jack Daniels BBQ Pulled Pork Poutine was delicious and the Bacon \"Royale with Cheese\" burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here on a weekday night and it was pretty empty. The burgers are big and tasty. I certainly prefer eating here over something like Five Guys. However I wouldn't call this place a \"gourmet\" burger joint (even though they are priced like they are!).  The fries are the typical style you find around Montreal. I can't really say I'm a fan. They're kinda soggy and not that great.  If you sit on the patio, the neighboring restaurant is very busy, noisy, and smoky, so be prepared. This is Crescent street after all."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've literally ever had. I ordered the brie and wild mushroom burger with a side of poutine. I'm 100% coming back to try their other stuff. My cousin and I were here with her baby - They were also family/child-friendly."}
{"text":"I was here back in April for my birthday. My husband and I loved this place, we loved everything about it. I had the Boss Burger. It was soooo good, Just the right amount of flavor and not much grease. I had a side order of poutine, which was surprisingly good too. I can't remember the burger my husband had but I believe it was the Hangover. He kept raving about how good it taste. The burgers are big so prepare to be stuffed once you're done eating. For dessert I had the pecan pie and he had the chocolate chip cookie. Both very delicious. The service was very attentive as well. I can't remember our waitress's name but she was a really sweet girl who kept coming over to make sure we were okay. If I'm ever in Montreal again I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Bonne adresse si vous avez envie d'un bon burger fait maison ... carte Burger top avec des recettes très différentes de ce que l'on peut trouver ailleurs  Le quebequois est tout simplement divin"}
{"text":"As Americans from Ohio we were looking for a place to watch the Cleveland Cavaliers playoff game and have some drinks. This place was amazing. I had the boss burger with fries and it's one of the best burgers I've ever had. Our waitress was also great with drink recommendations. If I was around more I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I had their Grilled Chicken nachos. They melted the cheese to the chips which was a great idea. Just a small portion of chicken. It was basic good flavor."}
{"text":"This is a loud and slightly rowdy place though fine for families and co-workers.  I started with the Very Berry Martini-well named. Our server was very friendly and attentive without being overly so. We ordered the Jack Daniel Burger-really good, the JD sauce is rich, thick and on the sweet side. We failed to order the bacon well done and the flaccid bacon was a bummer. We had to try the award winning Hangover Burger-as scrumptious mess of AAA burger, American cheese, bacon, fried egg, caramelized onions & poutine with truffle oil. The burger was easily 6 inches tall and a feast of all our favorites. The server highly suggested a side of greens (I think he feared a massive coronary ).  As it turned out, the tangy dressing was the perfect acidic foil to the heavy burger. We had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers.  The hangover is a monster: fried egg and poutine and a juicy thick beef patty.  I don't even know how to start with this burger... Staff was amazing and jokes with us.  Came to check up on us all night and refilling water/bringing us napkins."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I had the surf and turf burger which was much bigger than i expected (extra points for that) and i also had a pulled pork poutine which was very tasty but had very little cheese. That was disappointing to me because not only do i love cheese but asks yourself this : what's a poutine if not gravy with a lot of cheese?  That was disappointing. I guess next time I'll request extra cheese..."}
{"text":"After waiting 1.5 hrs for food that did t come at les 3 brasseurs, burger bar didn't disappoint. Had a bison burger with arugula and coleslaw and a side of sweet potato fries. It was awesome. They take Visa, MasterCard or cash. Amex not accepted. Our waiter was courteous and always checked on us. We sat on balcony slightly tight but food made up for it."}
{"text":"I went there for a late dinner on a saturday night around 11pm, half an hour before the kitchen closed. I was honestly really disappointed. The fries were not only very dry (which I could totally understand granted, we were literally their last customers of the evening), but flavorless. The burger was highly average at best, the same goes for the poutine. I'm a huge burger fan, but unfortunately this place didn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and it was over the Burger week so decided to have one there while passing by...   And absolutely loved the bison burger!! I'm addicted to truffle and like mushrooms a lot so that was the perfect combination... Can only recommend it!   I had a salad with it, which was OK however my friend had the coleslaw and that was yummy!!!   Friendly staff!   Wasn't too keen on decoration-layout of the restaurant hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Filling portions. The hangover poutine was excellent. Husband liked his Mac and cheese. It's hard to get into the building if you are pushing a stroller, can't imagine a wheelchair."}
{"text":"Got the Royale with cheese and I was not disappointed. The burger was made to perfection. Full of flavour and different kinds of textures! Their Dijon mayonnaise was amazing. Big portions too."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  I got the Blue and it was the best burger that I've ever had.  Amazing service, food, and atmosphere... the patio is terrific too!  Ask for Ben.  He gave us really good service...."}
{"text":"Ordered take away and the burger was great and well prepared.  The bean veg burger alternative wasn't that great.  So if thinking of getting someone not beef, I'd go for the salmon."}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to have a good burger and it couldn't have been better! I had a crispy chicken, it was delicious. So was The Boss, a pulled pork burger that we ordered. One of our friend was vegetarian, so she ordered a veg patty in the Chix Dig It burger. She found the patty a little dry and brittle but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. Great burgers and variety. The mushroom poutines is just amazing. The smores and cheesecake desserts were extremely tasty.   Prices are pretty good as it's on crescent. I would suggest getting the royal or the spicy burger nut you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is good. We had a great evening there. Perfect please to eat a great burger and to drink a good beer. The place won the prize of the best burger in town last year and it definitely deserves it! The Foie Gras burger is delicious. Maybe slightly overpriced but it worth it."}
{"text":"The Spot:  You know that what you're eating is really good when you decide it's totally worth it to have sauce and french fries dripping down your face in front of your new boss. Going out to grab a burger and fries typically conjures thoughts of fast food and cheap restaurants but the Burger Bar has refined this concept, bringing us gourmet burgers of great variety. The atmosphere is chic yet casual, a perfect place to drop by in no more than jeans and a t-shirt. Although considered yourself warned: by the end of the meal you may have to undo your top button, these portion sizes are not for the faint of heart.  No where else will you find burgers with toppings piled so high that only a hippopotamus would be able to fit the entire thing into it's mouth. The burgers are relatively cheap with the average burger coming in between $12 to $15 range. The exception being the \"hundred dollar burger\", which luckily cashes in at $25. With a AAA beef patty, pan seared foie gras, caramelized onions, sautéed wild mushrooms with truffle oil, arugula and a demi glace, it certainly tastes like it's worth a crisp hundred bucks.  What's Really Good: If you're in need of a filling meal and a good dose of iron, the Burger Bar is definitely a good place to go. Although probably not the best place to bring a date, because there is no way you are going to look sexy eating these dishes.  For the tourist we recommend the poutine burger, because never again in your life will you be able to experience something as ridiculous. Imagine: a burger piled high with poutine, where you can also opt to get poutine on the side. Add in a Canadian beer and you are making our nation proud. We ordered the Kobe beef hotdog poutine as an appetizer (ok, so we may have overdid it on the poutine...), but felt the meal needed more kobe beef to justify the expense. Same with the lobster macaroni and cheese. The onion rings were really fresh and lightly battered and make a good swap for your fries.  With gourmet burger spots popping up all over North American cities, Burger Bar is a fun, welcoming environment carving their niche as a combination of gourmet ingredients and insane portion sizes and toppings.  You'll Wanna Know:  If you're ordering appetizers and a burger, skip the side plate of fries and get a healthy leafy green salad instead; trust me, by the time you get to that point in the meal your body is going to be craving vegetables. There is a patio upstairs which is great for a breathe of fresh air, but it can be loud to eat out there during prime crescent street party time."}
{"text":"D'excellents burgers, variés et originaux. Ce n'est pas la première fois que nous y allons et ce ne sera pas la dernière. Service impeccable. Nous le recommandons fortement."}
{"text":"The wings here awesome !!! Get the buffalo ones . They are still spicy but have more flavor and there's blue cheese mixed into the buffalo sauce . They are super tender and the meat falls right off the bone. The burgers are huge and delicious!! So many different \"themes\" of topping you can get. Service is great and have friendly staff. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I was confused on who exactly was serving us. At one point we needed some extra napkins and because three people had come over I wasn't sure who to ask . Which isn't actually that big of a deal because service was still great except I would of liked to have a set person to ask things for."}
{"text":"If you like massive burgers and fries, then this is the place for you. If you like cold beer and big burgers and tasty fries, this place is for you. If you like your fries to be covered in gravy and cheese curds, aka poutine, this place is for you.   While the poutine here isnt the best, the poutine plus massive burgers are everything you ever could have hoped for and more. The beer selection could use some improvement, so dock a star there. It's also a bit dingy inside, but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"In the heart of Downtown Montreal on Crescent st. It was easy making reservations for a party of 10. The restaurant has two floors very compact but great layout. They have daily drink specials, we went on a Wednesday -7$ old fashioned and specials on beer.  I ordered a stout with the hangover burger for 20$, it was gigantic! A burger with poutine, american cheddar and beef and a fried egg (overly cooked). The presentation was incredible. I still had to take out the poutine portion out of the burger to eat it. The fries were dry, not enough sauce. I didn't finish the whole dish. I give the burger quality 3/5.   Their dessert menu looked good but I was too ful to eat! if you check in with the yelp app you'll get 50% off dessert! Just a notefor birthdays, if you bring a cake there is a 20$ cake cutting fee."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in Montreal that I've been to. Their burgers have been cooked great to my liking every time, they have a nice variety from regular to kind of over the top toppings. Their buns are really amazing, they're super duper soft. I almost want to say their made in house but don't quote me on that. Not only do they have great burgers, but their poutine is really awesome to boot. The gravy is excellent, it stands out to me over other poutine spots in the area.  My recommendation is The Boss burger and upgrade the fries to a poutine. Done deal. The chocolate chip cookie desert is good too."}
{"text":"Great burgers!!!! Fries could be crispier but otherwise service great and really nice location."}
{"text":"Went her before a Pink concert. I had the BabaGanoush burger, roasted pepper, portobello mushroom & eggplant. It had a great taste but be cause the burger was so high I had to eat it deconstructed. I wished I could taste all the flavours in one bite.  My sister had the pulled pork, I would pass on that one, it was staked but it wasn't something I would crave or go out to get. We shared the poutine, it was a good side to our meal but wasn't the best I had and was pretty expensive for such a plain poutine.  I know this will sound silly but the coleslaw was to die for! I seriously would order a plate of the slaw and be content.  All in all a good meal but I wouldn't say it's the BEST burger in town.  Try it out, rate or yourself:)"}
{"text":"AMAZING place. My fiancée and I didn't order a burger because we wanted poutine on our first night out in Montreal. We both ordered the meat poutine. It was delicious. We also shared mac and cheese which was equally amazing. It was happy hour (I think it was 5-7 PM?) while we were there so we loaded up on alcohol as well. Great experience!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal with two kids and two adults. We wanted to go out for a casual bite to eat.  This place was perfect! It was a Wednesday night and we went about 10:30 PM. We had no reservation but they were able to see this immediately. Their specialty is hamburgers and bison burgers. Among us we had a pulled pork nachos, their signature Empire short rib sandwich, and the grilled vegetable salad, which comes with hot grilled vegetables over a cold salad. Everyone was happy with what they had! They have many draft beers on tap as well as at least 20 bottles selections. There is also wine and spirits."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burgers I've had at a restaurant. Their black bean burgers are also great. Good location and good service. This is my new go-to place."}
{"text":"If it's your first time here, you have to get the Hangover burger. Don't be overwhelmed by the size, it's worth every bite. Plus, if you haven't tried poutine, what better way than adding it to a burger  Cute restaurant, fast service."}
{"text":"Our server, Shawn, was very knowledgable and pleasant.  However, we came based on rave reviews of the burgers. The Bison burger was dry and the consistency compact. However, maybe the beef burger is better."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  I judged this place at first. For some reason I had low expectations.  However, my burger was wonderful. I ordered the QUÉBÉCOIS medium well with coleslaw (instead of fries).  The burger was pretty big. It was juicy and cooked perfectly.   The coleslaw was surprisingly very good as well. It was vinegar based with a hint of sweetness.   Customer service was great."}
{"text":"We were famished after touring the nearby Art Museum and needed something hearty for lunch. A quick glance at the menu and we were sold. We weren't disappointed. Everyone loved their food (burgers and chicken sandwich). Kids were excited to see Stewart's sodas on the menu. I got my first poutine and all I can say is OMG! It was the hangover version- balsamic marinated mushrooms, bacon and a fried egg on top of traditional poutine. Seriously good. The vibe inside is nice, as were our servers. Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"C'est mon burger bar préféré! Super bien situé, le service est correct. La carte des cocktails est un peu restreinte mais ça ne me dérange pas trop car j'y vais pour les burgers et non pour l'expérience bar. Je trouve aussi que la salle est confortable, et l'ambiance bonne. Mon burger préféré reste le Baba Burger, excellentes saveurs de légumes rôtis et de baba ghanouj. Je l'ai essayé avec les frites, les frites de patates douces et la salade. J'ai bien aimé les trois. La portion est très généreuse aussi. Je le recommande définitivement!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here had the royal with cheese.  Excellent burger.  Easy dining great food."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great place! Goliath the best!, also great prices"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. In all honesty I didn't expect much from this burger place but was pleasantly surprise. My burger was delicious and their sweet potatoes fries and home made coleslaw was everything. Friend staff and chill decor. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Burger Bar Crescent had a really cool environment for a bite to eat or a drink. We had a group of 9 which meant we had to wait just a bit but our hostess was very nice and accommodating. At the bar, my cousin and I tasted a few beers and settled on their house brewed beer and a cider. Both we really good.  After being seated, we ordered a variety of burgers and poutines. The smoked meat poutine was really satisfying and tasted kind of like a pastrami. My blue cheese burger (recommended by our waiter) was sooo tasty. The meat patty was cooked just right, for me, medium-ish. A tiny touch of pink but mostly medium. Juicy and and salted just right. It seemed like a full house that evening so our burgers took a while to come out but they were certainly worth the wait. I chose a side of coleslaw to go with my burger which was a sweet vinaigrette slaw and surprisingly really refreshing and good.  We finished off with a fried Mars bar dessert (50% off with a Yelp check in promo). The melty chocolate and crispy outside went really well with the ice cream. My bill was about $55 Canadian dollars which is really fair considering the portion size of the burgers!  Service was great and food was awesome! Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I couldn't come back to Montreal without coming to this place again.   This place has a hip vibe to it always playing some cool music. Really a cool atmosphere whether you are going with your buddies, your girlfriend or mistress or as a first date.   Their spiked lemonade or whatever they call it is very good. Doesn't taste like it has any booze in it but then you have two or three and your drunker than a Kennedy. I opted to start some wings as despite them being a Burger Bar (hence the name) their wings are top notch.   I went with the General Tao wings. General Tao if you don't know led the Canadian army to an upset VICTORY over the hated Russians in the nineteen tickety two grand nationals of hockey. He is a real treasure.   The wings are a but pricey but comparable for downtown Montreal. However they are phenomenal they have some spice to them but nothing overhlwhelming. The wings are huge as well and come with green onions on top. They are really good, this place could be a wing bar.   After demolishing the wings I knew I needed a burger. Their menu is rich with some traditional burgers but being that I live a boring mundane life I decided to rip it up a bit and opted for \"The Dude\" which is a combo of beef, veal, and pork. This burger is only offered as well done as it has veal.   It came shortly thereafter and it was a beast. The flavor blend is on point. Cooked perfectly and nice and juicy. Their buns not unlike my own is a star on its own. It has what seems like everything bagel seasoning on it. It's very good as is this place thru and thru.   This place has a mellow vibe with a hipster feel and food that will leave you in need of a cold shower. Don't be fooled that because it's on Crescent Street that it's a tourist trap it's not, I mean it is but it doesn't mean it's a place to be avoided you are doing yourself a big disservice by not coming here and stuffing your face."}
{"text":"If you're doing it right then you're going to make a mess. If you're ordering an average burger then you're really missing out on what this place does best. They've really figured out an awesome variety of things to mash together on a burger. I these burgers are so full of flavourful ingredients that you'll end up with it all over your face and plate. It's not their fault you can't open your mouth wider! Good beer selection, comfortable dining area, great waitstaff. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for and you get more than most restaurants in general!"}
{"text":"Checked out the Burger Bar on Rue Crescent in Montreal on 4/12/15. Wow!  Incredible!  If you are a fan of burgers,  this is a must for you.  Had the Supersonic Burger which was perfectly cooked.  It's a bit $ for a burger but its worth it.  Buns are lightly toasted, well seasoned beef.  Toppings were fresh.  Wait staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating.  Although its was a little chilly, they have an outdoor seating area that overlooks the street which is cool.  French fries were hand cut.   Wish this place was near my home back in the States.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here with 6 other friends during our trip to Montreal and the food and service were spectacular. Since I was in a bigger group, we were seated on the second floor. We were the only ones there but it was really fun to be able to see the nightlife from the windows. Best burger I've ever had no exaggeration. I would love to eat here again next time I go to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place was just the right distance from where I was staying. I'm really glad I chose this place, the drinks were right (great happy hour deals) and the food was just delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Strong drinks, great burgers.  'nuff said."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and so filling, we took home more than half of each dish.   The chicken burger had 4, yes 4 chicken patties (now you can see why so much was leftover) chicken was flavoured well with just a tinge of spicy taste.  Hangover poutine had bacon, eggs, mushrooms in it and was extremely filling.  The service was exceptional, restaurant was busy but yet the servers were always around asking if everything is okay and topping up the water. Everyone was pleasant and easy going.  Prices are a bit on the higher side but the ambience and food make up for it."}
{"text":"Nothing special I mean the menu looks really good but it's notning crazy cool. My burger wasn't even juicy I rather a Harvey's burger lol"}
{"text":"Burger Bar is located in the middle of Crescent's bar drag but it was surprisingly affordable in a city that sucks money out of you faster than a Chernobyl mosquito. I appreciated how their burgers aren't exotic for the sake of exoticism like most \"upscale burger\" joints, but seem to have a bit of thought behind them. The waitress was cheerful without being chirpy, so that is a plus also. Probably better to go earlier in the day before Crescent fills up with clubbers and the like."}
{"text":"I'm always thinking about food but this place came to mind after a friend mentioned that she would be going up to Montreal. One of the first places I recommended was the Burger Bar. I distinctly remember the great experience I had here. I ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ burger and an order the grilled vegetable with chorizo poutine and split it with a friend. I can't even begin to describe the great flavor everything had.  I stayed at this establishment for probably ... 5 hours. After the food and 2 pitchers of sangria later, we both felt like it was time well spent. If anyone is in that area, this place offers great service, great food, great sangria... A definite 5 star rating.  The only recommendation would be, stick with the red sangria. The white sangria was good too but it felt too light and citrus-y. It would definitely make a good brunch drink. However the red sangria is a solid and delicious beverage. I will definitely visit this establishment again"}
{"text":"I recently went to Burger Bar for lunch on a girl's weekend in Montreal.  The restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel concierge since we were staying in the downtown area and wanted some place close for lunch that had good poutine.  Burger Bar is in the heart of downtown.  It was pretty busy for a Monday lunch.  We ordered the traditional poutine which was delicious -  I wish it had been a bigger serving.  We also all got burgers - their burgers are incredible, huge and they have at least 10+ different versions.  It was on the best burgers I had in a while.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Very popular spot in the center of downtown area. We were looking for a place with good appetizers and this was perfect! Food is amazing and happy hour has really good drinks. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cool scene, especially if you sit outside.  I got the pulled pork poutine, which I very much enjoyed.  If you don't like sweet bbq, you wouldn't like it.  The fries could be a bit crisper..  The burger was well done but it was very flavorful.  It had some kinda smoked meat on it.  I don't remember which one it was..  All in all, it's a solid place to eat and do some people watching."}
{"text":"Pretty much an out-of-this-world experience start to finish love the inside love the food love the options love the beers love the staff. If you're forcing me to make a complaint I would say you have to Trek upstairs to go to the bathroom. And if that's the worst thing about your establishment you're doing pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere in cold Montreal  I love this place We visit for family twist a year  And I never miss out a burger and beer there"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that my fiancé and I received the BEST customer service I have ever witnessed at Burger Bar. The waitress we had (totally forgot her name) was AMAZING. I have never left a $13 tip for anyone and this restaurant deserved it. I will definitely be coming back when I get the chance just for the customer service.  And the FOOD! My fiancé and I opted for the smoked meat poutine and loved it. We also had the Mac and Cheese. Their happy hour is from 4-7 PM and they have discounts on their drinks and (I think) their appetizers. I had 2 Long Islands for the price of one! If I could rate this restaurant 6 or 7 stars, I would."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Montreal!   After the first time, I couldn't stay away! The burgers here are perfection with a nice selection of flavourful toppings - there is something for everyone.  The bun was great too! Best part is choosing your type of meat for the patty.   The sides are pretty delicious too. Fries, salad, whatever you like. This is a pretty great meal and the atmosphere is cozy upscale bar. Family friendly but also first date worthy.   Definitely a must try if you're craving a burger. Hope you like it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Not too much to say about this place. If you arent sitting down waiting to order, stop reading this review and get over there. I had a late dinner here with a work colleague; I had the Big Blue and she had the Jack Daniels Burger. Both were just incredible, every aspect of the burger thoughtfully crafted. The cheese on my burger definitely bleu me away. The meat cooked to a perfect medium rare. The freaking bun was noteworthy as well. I wish i had the time to try them all and i would try to sneak some back to California but the sniffing dogs would certainly give me away.  In summary, just drop whatever you are doing and get a burger here NOW!"}
{"text":"Really good burger! Their drink menu is surprisingly large, and their burgers all look awesome! A variety of options and combinations as well as plenty of choices for those that aren't burger lovers. Service was quick and friendly, we had a nice meal."}
{"text":"I had \"The Boss\" burger and it certainly lived up to its status as best burger in Montreal. Coming from Asia I am a huge fan of the fried egg on the burger, and the rest of the toppings were just as succulent. Creamy home mayo, crispy bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, a juicy patty, and some crisp pickles--this burger was brilliant. The side of fries were irrelevant in relation to the burger and probably wouldn't hold their own in any other situation. This time, they get a pass though.   Prices are what you would expect on Crescent. Service was exceptional and bilingual, and the space is welcoming. Would certainly return for another burger."}
{"text":"Burger Bar Crescent is an the best place to eat in a sea of what seems to be dozens of trendy Montreal restaurants. Great reputation, alcohol and ambiance will get you to come in once, but fast and friendly staff, great music and amazing food will keep you coming back"}
{"text":"I came here over a year ago and loved the vibe of the restaurant. From what I remember, the portions were large and plentiful and the burger were expensive but delicious. I probably got the veggie burger and don't remember being disappointed. The fries, onion rings and other sides were a home run. I might have to visit soon to update my review and provide more detail."}
{"text":"The best place on go on dates at! I always go with my girlfriend and we always enjoy the burgers there.  The many variations of burgers will always leave you satisfied no matter which one you take. As a side, do your self a favor and take the coleslaw, holy cow do I love it!  The staff has always been friendly and has great atmosphere, whether inside or out. Beers and cocktail selection is pretty good and gets the job done.  Only down side would be there price, but even then you pay for what you get; and what you get is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I dropped by after a late night at the office. Apparently they don't do take out orders from 6-10pm but they made an exception for me since I was just grabbing one burger. The service was excellent and the wait was quick.  Ordered the Yosemite Sam burger and upgraded to onion rings. The patty was thick and juicy with a sexy pink center. It was topped with avocados, roasted red peppers, and homemade salsa, which added a nice freshness to a heavy burger. Even walking 10 mins in the cold from the restaurant to my place, the onion rings were still warm. I was most impressed with how they were still crispy!  After tip and tax, burger and rings came out to $28, which can be steep if you're used to regular burger joints. Overall, loved the place. Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"I came here last night on a date where I really wanted to WOW this girl. I asked for a table outside to be romantic and even though they were packed they still were able to accommodate us. I ordered the poutine with smoked meat and dill pickle and it was out of this world amazing. The burgers with pretty awesome too. This place definitely scored me a second date. I would recommend it to all. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Very tasty and has vegetarian options. Great service in both languages.   We had some sort of weird bachelor party going on when we were there and it was nothing but entertaining. A really great option for a buger and a beer/cider."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because we had to wait over 30 mins at the bar before we could order any food. Otherwise the food and service was incredible. David ordered the smoked meat burger with a poutine. I ordered the dude burger with an egg as per the bartenders recommendation. Food was incredible and the service we received from Sebastian was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the mac and cheese and wayyyy too much pepper.   Service is fine. Prices are a bit more expensive than I remembered.   Might have another burger soon to see if it's still good."}
{"text":"I went there with low expectations given there is a new trendy burger place popping up every 2 minutes in Montreal. Boy was I wrong the menu really is amazing and original!!!! I had the Sicilian burger it was quite special and went back the very next week. For the price I would say it is in the top 3 best burger places in Montreal, what makes it stand out really is the well thought menu it is not just a damn good beef burger"}
{"text":"Jai esseye se resto durant le burger week. Le grand gagant le burger avec poutine et oeuf mirroir cetais magique difficile a manger se qui agremente lexperience !"}
{"text":"I think we can all agree that the burger is one of the greatest foods on earth. Who doesn't love a great burger topped just the way they want it? With the numerous and creative varieties out there, I'm always looking for the next great burger joint.  One night after watching the Habs beat the Bruins at the Bell Centre, we decided to try this place out. We were not disappointed! Instead of the beef burger, we went for bison burgers. Hint: They are fresher than the beef patties as they're cooked to order ;) Bison meat is very lean compared to beef, but this one was perfectly cooked and very juicy, despite being so lean.  Add nice atmosphere and great service, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good service and the food is great for a place that is always crowded by tourists. They have outdoor seating, so its very nice on a warm day. The chicken wings appetizer was not that great but the burger was fanatic. I got the foie gras burger which was fantastic, the cole slaw was the best I have ever had. I considered asking for the recipe. The drink specials are great."}
{"text":"I would lean more like 3.5 stars here. Nothing super outstanding, but overall this was a pretty good spot. Went here for some food after a Canadiens game (because the food there is straight terrible) and got some pretty solid bar food.   Ordered a burger off the after 10pm menu and it was very satisfying. Their burgers here are HUGE. The one I ordered came complete with a slice of gouda about an inch thick. As a cheese lover, this was optimal. Also shared some wings and enjoyed the hot bbq sauce flavor as the wings were tender and easy to eat.   Decent prices, worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere but excellent, high quality food, generous portion sizes and attentive service. After a long drive when we were tired and starving this place was exactly the spot; highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is 4-7. I had the Mr Personality burger with sweet potato fries..my FAV!!  Was good in da belly!"}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just to give this dump a bad review. What horrible service. Ate there mid-afternoon during grand prix weekend. The restaurant was maybe half full, yet it still took a solid hour to get our less-than-mediocre burgers, which were dry and over compensated with crap toppings. Fries were cold & mushy and cooked in old/dirty oil . When issues were brought to managers attention (mostly related to time), she basically told us to F off. I only started feeling better about the situation after lingering around the entrance to point would-be-patrons away. If you read a positive review of this place, immediately write-off all other opinions of that individual."}
{"text":"We got the Jack Daniels spicy BBQ wings, Rocky burger, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, and smoked meat poutine.   ALL were very good. Lots of flavor. The wings were my fav. I'd eat those wings all day."}
{"text":"Les burgers sont très originales et le service étais super!  Par contre, les plats sont un peu trop chère pour un simple hamburgers"}
{"text":"This burger bar has many burger options and side orders to choose from to suit all different kinds of needs and tastes. I came with a large group of family members and they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly on a Saturday night. After we were seated, we were greeted by a friendly and personable server named Ben. He checked up on us often to ensure we had plenty of water in our glasses, napkins, and cleared away anything we needed when we were finished. His positive attitude throughout the night definitely made our meal a much more enjoyable experience. As for my meal I had a wild shroom burger and substituted the beef patty with a grilled chicken patty (+3). What I love about this place is that you can also get your burger replaced with a bean burger or veggie patty as well. So if you are vegetarian, fear not! Plenty of options for you too. There is also a carb free or what I sometimes call \"gluten free\" option where you can replace the bun with lettuce pieces instead which my cousin ordered. Long story short, I had a great time and meal, and would definitely come again if I didn't live in the United States! I'd like to mention that this was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Quality ingredients, big portions, plenty of options, good service and fun atmosphere - you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  I ordered the Royale with cheese and chose the lettuce wrap option instead of the bun.  My bf ordered the Yosemite Sam and both were awesome.  Cooked to perfection with great flavors on both.  I personally liked the Royale better and highly recommend that.  In addition to the delish burgers, the fries are on point too- perfectly crispy just the way I like it.   The burgers are a tad bit pricey, but for that location (near all the shops, and other bars and restaurants) plus great service I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"\"Wow Le burger Bar, c'est trop bon\"... \"Le Burger Bar a gagné le prix du meilleur burger l'année dernière\". Un mercredi soir, envie d'un bon burger, c'est donc tout naturellement que Je pense à cette it-place du centre de Montréal. Le menu est hyper alléchant: burgers au bleu, avec des Mac & cheese, un autre à la poutine et meme un au fois gras. Rock n' roller pour mon copain, Belle Bleu pour moi. Le fromage etait tres bon, Le buns et les ingredients très frais. En revanche, un effort est à faire sur la qualité de la viande et la recette de la galette. Pas assez juteuse, ni goutue. Côté service, mention bien, sauf que les serveuses n'ont pas l'air tres heureuses de travailler ensemble. Cela se ressent un peu sur la clientèle. La notre (une petite blonde) était toute cute et attentionnée. Dans l'ensemble, c'est un place \"pretty cool\" pour Crescent. Je crois que j'etais un peu déçue à cause des echos dythirambiques que j'avais eu. Next? Art Burger- gagnant de la Burger Week 2013"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"best burger in Montreal\", but it was not as great as I thought it would be. There was just too much going on in one burger. There's other burger joints I would recommend in Montreal.  However, service was good and it's in an excellent location. This place gets very busy on weekend nights!"}
{"text":"YUM. GO in and ask the server for their suggestions and go for it! That is what we did and we weren't disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Burgers were great and the sweet potato fries were fabulous also! Waitress was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Catherine our lovely waitress was really cool and knew exactly what we needed. Her recommendations we're on par for what we were looking for.   If you've ever had a restaurant experience where you felt like the waitress knew just what the group needed and could be part of the group in a professional way then you know what I'm talking about.  The blue burger was excellent. Burger was cooked perfectly. Fries were the perfect crispy. The beer was amazing. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger was to die for! I got the Baba Burger. Came with balsamic reduction, garlic mayo, roasted red pepper, zucchini, and baba ganoush! Delish. I got the fries on the side. Good fries but I'm more of a shoestring girl so weren't my favorite. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Burgers, burgers and poutine!  Wonderful food, wonderful service and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Je suis été au Burger Bar Crescent durant la Burger Week Mtl, car je voulais manger un vrai de vra burger. Je n'ai pas été déçu pour le burger. Une grosse bête. J'ai choisi le heartbreaker... une pourtine à l'intérieur d'un burger, faut le voir pour y croire. J'ai donné 3 étoiles, car par un malheureux hasard, j'ai du attendre 1h pour avoir mon burger en plein dimanche après-midi. De plus, la serveurse (très gentille) m'a offert un rabais qu'elle a oublié d'enlever sur la facture. Bref, 24$ pour un coke et un burger que j'ai attendu un heure."}
{"text":"On the list of \"must go\", I went. Being a burger fan this was right up my alley. In sum, burger ($16) was fantastic, and I got the poutine upgrade from regular fries ($3.95). Service, lacked. Hence the 4 stars, not 5.   I had the \"Royale With Cheese\". The burger was spiced perfectly and cooked perfectly medium. Meat was hot, cheese melted, and veggies were cool and crisp. It hadn't been sitting under a heat lamp wilting the lettuce. Bacon was good: crispy and not overly salty. The dressing was a type of mayo/grainy mustard-mix... was great. The poutine (it is Montreal after all) was good as well, not overly salty which I find a lot of the gravies are.  Service: Initially off to a good start I was seated right away, glass of water and asked for my drink ( a local red ale) which they brought promptly and took my order. After the meal, I waited for them to come around as my glass had one tiny sip left, and I would've liked another. I waited. I was on the patio, there were 10 others, so not like I was hidden away. Restaurant inside was only maybe 60-70% full. Still waiting, looking trying to get the attention of someone.   A guy sat next to me, hostess who sat him gave him a water, said the server would be right out. 10-15 min later the guy who had long since put his menu down said 'forget it' and left. I'm still waiting, trying to get the attention of any server.  I went inside to the bar and told them I'd like to pay my bill.  Bartender asked if I had everything I needed and I said \"no, what I wanted was another beer\" and then told her I'll go across the street to get one (Crescent Street has no end of cool places to grab a beer), and informed her of the other table that left because no one came out to the patio in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, the burgers are AMAZING. One of the two best I've had in Montréal so far"}
{"text":"The burger selection, and the applied creativity are fairly astounding in this joint.   This place is almost like a fine dining burger place, based purely on the fanciness of the menu :)  The food tasted great, the service was friendly and attentive - a definite winner.   PS  The milkshake serving containers are a nice touch - kind of like a jar with a handle :)"}
{"text":"Upscale burger joint,with a full bar, 2 storeys, on busy Crescent club/bar strip. All kinds of burgers including chicken,bison,your standard beef,dressed up,and my fave: the Samorai...spicy salmon,Japanese -style.  The noise level here is average earlier in the afternoon, but can quickly escalate to deafening as the place fills and livens up. Prices are quite reasonable,without drinks,otherwise add $10.00 more,per drink."}
{"text":"I recommend Imperial. I did not  find something interesting in the blue-cheese Bison burger. We got a Tuango coupon of 40 for 20 as it was a little above our budget. For muslims: you can ask them to order all the burgers as veggie. We ordered Baba with extra rings and liked it. They puy a large mushroom inside and a veggie berger. I did not try it, but Captain nemo without bacon seems cool!"}
{"text":"I look for burger joint on yelp so by the reviews, we said let's give it a try. This place was very good. The atmosphere was fantastic not to busy and not to slow. Our waitress was fantastic, always making sure we had everything. The burgers were amazing,the fries were great as well. When ever we come back to Montreal we will definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"Excellent service and one of best veggie burgers I have ever had (The Dude with veggie patty). The dessert (cookies with ice cream) was to die for. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  The burgers are flavourful and juicy and probably one of the best I have had in Montreal. Have tried four from the menu so far and all of them have been really good!! But the Jack Daniels burger is my favourite here. The servers are super helpful in deciding to what to order.  The ambience is upbeat and the place is almost always full. Would highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"Googled places to get a foie gras burger in Montreal and decided on this place. Wow I was not disappointed! It was our last meal of the trip, my Birthday, and I can't imagine finding a better burger. We had the foie burger, the ulti-mac n cheese, and the hangover poutine- I can't recommend this meal enough! Flavor explosion. Super friendly staff and good happy hour drink discounts."}
{"text":"Cute if small patio great service. Ample portions and fantastic beer selection.  Had the samuri burger (salmon) my mom had a wild mushroom burger. House red ale was good. Moms Hoegarden was huge! Really fantastic choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Edited since we went back a second time. The service on Friday night was excellent and the Stellar onion rings. Fabulous sweet potato fries. Service was great. I got a bison burger and my friend got the BBQ burger. Mine was a wee bit rarer than I usually eat at the recommendation of the server. I think I will stick with well done next time. But, it was still pretty darn good. Would most definitely go"}
{"text":"Un vrais plus pour le décors et l'ambiance ! Élégant, sobre mais chaleureux et cosy ! Playlist sympatoche (retour dans les années 2000 ... ;) et surtout on est vraiment pas déçus par ce qu'on a pris (burger et mac'cheez) ! Service sympathique et souriant ! 2 moins : les banquettes sont un peu basses par rapport à la table et le prix ... pas donné donné... Mais je conseille !!"}
{"text":"Good food but not extraordinary. The climatisation was turned on with only 15 degrees outside.. little bit too cold for me.  The ambiance was cool and the decoration of pub/restaurant is well done.  Waitress was cold like the weather.  I recommend because you can enjoy in different conditions. Nevertheless i give only 3 stars for the cold temperature and the waitress."}
{"text":"Ordered Mr.Personality burger with Stella. Enjoy that afternoon. Not bad, but not as fantastic as I thought."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I ever ate was here. And I never would've thought it'd be a salmon sandwich.  But it was. And it was amazing. The flavors of the fried sesame, almond crusted salmon fillet with wakame salad was pure happiness in a sesame bun. I highly recommend going to this place and ordering the Samurai II sandwich. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was a good solid burger. Average price and very filling. I have had better burgers elsewhere but Burger Bar Cresent does a quality burger. Fries were also decent"}
{"text":"Enormous burgers are eye popping, but how do they actually TASTE? That's what's important. Well, mine was amazing.  I got the spicy burger with peppers, bacon, cheese... it was just insane.  I  thought about that burger for days after.  Juicy, great flavor, then peppers were a great touch.  Service was a little slow, but then again, restaurants move at a slower pace in Canada than they do in the States.  Wasn't crazy about the accompanying salad I chose over the fries. I just felt obliged to go the salad route knowing this burger would put me at risk for clogged arteries as it is.  Only annoying thing about the place... there were hornets flying around us constantly on the patio.  When the weather is nice in Montreal, you want to be outside, but it really was a nuisance."}
{"text":"This is definitely a must go to place. The food is amazing.  The service was great. Look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant about 5 or 6 times now. Very impressed each time I visit. Great choices of burgers at decent price for downtown. My personal favorite is the super sonic. But what stands out mostly for me was their superb poutines. Perhaps the best I have tasted in some time. Mostly due I think in part by the gravy they use. Simply wonderful. My only negative might be the size of the bar. Its called Burger Bar but yet they can only seat 7 at the bar downstairs? Regardless, great atmosphere and the menu is fantastic. Oh the service is pretty awesome also."}
{"text":"Trendy hipster upscale burger place.  Waitress spent most of the time at the bar talking to her friends.  My burger was a little over cooked but still very good.  I would recommend the burger bar, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"So good you have to stop. And don't split your meal you'll regret it because the food is that good. Burgers perfectly cooked. Crispy fries with the Fixins. I seriously will come back to Montreal and eat here every night."}
{"text":"Big and tasty! That's all i can say. The burgers are BIG, really BIG! But so so goooood! The wings are well marinated (both spicy and non spicy). Deserts are really tasty! I recommend the french toast, deep fried mars bar! They are too good!   The burgers are a bit on the pricey side but they are good so I wouldn't mind paying a bit more.   Service were great! Everytime I went, they were always super nice to me! (And I've been there a bunch of time!)"}
{"text":"Not to be missed. On a cold -24C day in Montreal we stumbled into this oasis... the peach sangria was fab... the burger waz great... and even the resident vegetsian scored big with a black bean mushroom burger. The pecan pie was amazing. The staff was pleasant and accommodating.  Really a great spot... we will visit again."}
{"text":"This place only was worth the trip from New York, best burger in my life and I'm very picky about my junk food! Buffalo burger with wild mushrooms"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Montreal, it is a MUST to stop by Burger Bar. They have THE BEST Burgers I have ever had in my life! They have a wide and unique selection of burgers but you can't go wrong with any of them. They're all fresh, juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Burger bar has never let me down.  If you're down for some shots, they make the SMOOTHEST Kamikaze shots of life.  Service is excellent and the bartenders are the best!"}
{"text":"All I can say it was a nice local burger / bar joint. Burger was delicious and the service was good."}
{"text":"Je donne la note de passage au Burger Bar, mais de justesse! Il y a place à l'amélioration et je m'attendais à tellement plus! Les serveuses sont gentilles et attentionnées. Mais il y a un manque à la cuisine! Ça ne fournissait pas quand j'y suis allée et ce n'était pas si remplie que ça. Mes voisins de table se sont fait offrir deux drinks gratuits par la maison tellement que l'attente était anormalement longue...! J'ai trouvé que ma bouffe aurait pu être plus chaude. Les ailes de poulet n'étaient pas assez cuites mais les frites sont bonnes.  Attention!!! Ils ne prennent pas intérac!! Cash ou crédit seulement!!! (Je vais y retourner car tout resto mérite une deuxième chance (ou peut-être parce que j'ai un autre coupon Groupon...?!)"}
{"text":"Solid burgers- had their biz burger and found it to be filling and juicy. While I do want to try other burger joints in Montreal, it's good to know I have a solid choice going forward to fall back on."}
{"text":"Waited about 1 hour to get food. The menu is the same as the 3 brewers. I would recommend going there instead."}
{"text":"one of my favorite meals in montreal! great area - lots of cute restaurants with outdoor seating (this place included), young professionals walking around even on a tuesday evening. recommended by folks at the university of montreal, we came here as a party of 6 and were quickly seated. menu (including beers on tap, cocktails) was extensive. sandwiches, mac n cheese, poutine, salads available but gotta get a burger here (bison too!). i tried the quebecois lettuce wrap (most burgers around $20) with poutine (an extra $4). quebecois had mushroom, bacon, cheese - savory, filling, patty cooked perfectly medium, delicious. poutine was great too - real cheese curds, gravy was rich, fries are fresh. lots of TVs around showing sports (hockey and basketball on when we were there), service was friendly and helpful, i'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great decor, good service, good prices but the food just isn't that good. I have to say out of all the burger joints in Montreal, this is my least favorite."}
{"text":"Burger was great.  Surprised to see many families with children stop by for a bite.  There was a loud group of guys causing a bit of a scene but the waitress was great at asking them to quiet down and be respectful for the minors in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is for sure over priced and the plating is not well figured out. Me and the BF got the popcorn chicken poutine. The chunks of cheese were cut so large that the gravy BARELY even softened them, i had to cut them up into smaller chunks so so i could get even bits of cheese to fries. And not to mention there were peas in them (did not state on the menu) and that was not good in the poutine, very bad texture and flavour with the rest of the food. Ive worked in restaurants and i know when its time to change your cooking oil, and they clearly do not. The popcorn chicken looked almost burnt and the fried were looking a little on the black side too. But the insides were fine, this means your oil is dirty and the crumbs and bits from other foods are refrying on your fresh food. NOT GOOD cause it ruins the texture and flavours. I was not down for the, mind you the portion sizes are good, i was def full after eating it (minus those peas)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their Royale burger with cheese along with a side of onion rings. The burgers was packed with flavor and prepped just right. Truly hit the spot. The onion rings were prepped to perfection. No greasy. Perfectly cooked being crispy on the inside and soft and chewy on the inside. I really enjoyed my meal and loved they had some Stewart Black Cherry to accompany my meal.  Service was quick and friendly, price-tag was good considering the location.  My only gripe was the old fashioned I ordered for happy hour, it was way too strong and I opted to limit alcohol just there.  Loved this place, would be back for sure."}
{"text":"A little crowded, but the food was amazing. The Dude burger was perfectly cooked and super tasty."}
{"text":"A great trendy spot for young adults in Montreal's Restaurant Row. My girlfriend and myself liked EVERYTHING that we had here.  Drinks: I got two Quebec beers that were awesome. Great recommendation from our waitress. My girlfriend got a vodka lemonade cocktail and a Canadian whiskey one as well, both top notch.   Appetizer: we got the hangover poutine, phenomenal. It was your standard poutine with fries, Gravy and cheese curds. But with the hangover, add bacon an egg and awesome tasting gravy. We both agreed, this was the best poutine we've ever had.   Dinner: we mixed it up with our dinner options. The burger I got was The Supreme. Really good, cheeseburger with a spicy mayo, pickles, onion rings and spicy peppers. My girlfriend got the Samurai II, nice sesame crusted salmon filet with a crunchy seaweed salad and spicy wasabi dressing. It was served with on a soft seeded bun and she chose a side of coleslaw. Amazing! We ate every last bite despite how full we were because it was THAT good! So many choices to choose from, and all looked delicious.   We definitely recommend you go if you're hungry, enjoy good drinks, and a fun environment!"}
{"text":"We were on the search for a great burger in Montreal.  We came here based on previous great reviews and I am so glad we did.  I had \"The Dude\" and it was fantastic.  The 911 sauce was extremely spicy but delicious.  We had the best service here.  If you get the chance to come here, check and see if Marine is working.  She is awesome and will make sure you get the best food and have the best time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for drinks and for food. I went with a group of 8 people during poutine week. They had several options of poutines in addition to their regular menu. Everyone at the table enjoyed either poutines, mac and cheese or burgers.  I ordered the wild mushroom mac and cheese and it was absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"Had hangover and mushroom burger it was Good burgers but lacking the special something. Meat was juicy and but sauces overwhelmed it. Decor was ok but more of a tourist trap kind of eye catching way. Staff was super nice and kind."}
{"text":"Ginormous burgers!  Such a cute place.... love the vibe and atmosphere.  Seriously, they have such a wide array of burgers to choose from.  My friend had the special that day, Shepard's Pie.  We were thinking it would be a Shepard's pie, as in the pie.  But it was a Shepard's Pie burger.... burger with the Shepard's Pie ingredients.  So good!   Also ordered the HOT buffalo wings.  Wasn't hot enough for this Korean girl.  Tasty though.     It is a little pricey for burgers, but....they are good juicy burgers.  Service, a little slow because there was only one server taking care of about 7 parties.  She was a gem!"}
{"text":"Went here for a few burgers and wings on our stay, prices were reasonable and the service was quick. Everyone enjoyed their meal, and the serving sizes were very generous. We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria which was delicious and also an unexpected menu item. Would recommend."}
{"text":"HEY, it's a tourist trap HAMBURGER joint for*****sake. But they go above and beyond. Monterey Jack cheese? OMG best cheese there is and loved from years in Santa Cruz. Some good beers - Griffon Amber pairs nicely with view from upstairs deck and strollng ladies.  I picked a BBQ Bison burger with caramelized onions, tomatoes, and Jack Daniel BBQ sauce. Quite tasty. It was  done to perfection, the coleslaw side was fantastic, but $41.39 for a cheeseburger and two beers?  Even with the exchange (US CDN) that's a lot. So pick your weather and agenda. Go when music and partying is on or at least nice weather to let you hang out on the deck. Otherwise it's just a tasty, overpriced burger."}
{"text":"This is a great option if you wanna watch a game and crave a burger with fries. I honestly can't remember the last time I've had a burger like this. I went for the jack Daniels burger though you probably won't go wrong with any of the options on the menu. I upgraded the fries to poutine which turned out to be a solid choice. One of my friends tried the bacon mac n cheese and said it was fantastic as well. With a great environment and excellent staff, the burger bar is a must visit in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Awesome, tasty burgers here.  Great friendly and attentive service.   Great selection of burgers. Good beer selection  This is what we ate:   ROYALE WITH CHEESE - a 6oz beef patty, with Swiss and cheddar blend, smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, and Dijon mayonnaise.  I had three burgers in mind to order and our waiter recommended the Royale which turned out to be so yummy, delicious with every bite!   The two cheese made the burger so flavorful.  I wished I ordered my burger medium rare because the burger was done a little over medium but it was still delicious.  The tomato slices were generous.  Good amount of thinly sliced red onions.  The smoked bacon added another tasty layer to the burger and top it off with the Dijon mayonnaise so good.  The burger is stacked high so you will need to eat strategically.  You have a choice of hand cut fries or a salad.  I got the fries which were good with the mayonnaise.  QUÉBÉCOIS - 6oz beef patty, sauteed wild mushrooms, smoked bacon, Swiss cheese, and caramelized onions.   Hubby enjoyed this burger.  He was so quiet.  Definitely be back for another burger!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Burger Bar for years! I used to go to Montreal for alot of conferences and I would have their delicious poutine delivered to me in bed. Absolutely amazing.   It's a great restaurant/bar located right on crescent (infamous street). I love sitting on the patio. The service is a bit slow but they are always super friendly. The 2 things I love; The Fried Chicken Salad with Toasted Pecans! The Poutine is amazing. Most people would go to Montreal for la banquise or any other famous Poutine joint. I think those are all over rated. This place does it right! Layering the cheese curds & gravy over the fries. It's perfection.   I can't wait to go back!  Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"The food was just delicious, from the super crispy onion rings, the HUGE hamburgers and do not start me on the poutine!!"}
{"text":"After talking about this place for weeks, my husband and I decided to go here for lunch and we fell in love with it. The restaurant is well located and we were lucky enough to find parking quickly as well. The service was on point and there was absolutely no delay in bringing the food or the bill.  We loved our burgers, I'd strongly suggest the coleslaw or the salad as side. The burgers were quite heavy, we saw some other customers struggling with the hangover burger. Their 911 sauce was the best (Indians love spicy anything really). I am probably not going to go there for a while cause you need to be really starving to finish the portions but I highly recommend Burger Bar to anyone new in town or just anyone who wants a great burger and large portions.   Price wise it was more towards the expensive side, but I feel its totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad.  The waitresses are hot, but that's about all it has going for it.  Some of the burgers are really gross, particularly the Hangover.  They are very tall and topped with all kind of fattening and high cholesterol toppings that don't really go properly on a hamburger.  The drink service is also pretty bad, to the point where I re-ordered it because I assumed my waitress had forgotten.  Granted, I got a mixed drink, but 15 minutes is a little excessive."}
{"text":"I'm enjoying my time in Montreal and the food is mainly why. Being a vegetarian Montreal has greeted me with open arms. Once again a restaurant not only accompanied vegetarian options but in a flavorful, not salad way. Burger bar has a cozy ambiance and was decorated well contributing to the holiday spirit. They offer a bar and television as well. I'm always about vibes and the restaurant offered a candlelit table with great music in the background. I was going to order the Baba but the waitress recommend a cheaper and similar option the Herbivore. My boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ burger with a fried egg we both got fries as a side. You have the options of ordering cole slaw or a mini poutine if you desire. My craving for Mac & cheese was satisfied when we ordered the traditional Mac. The cheesiness was heavenly and there was a slight spice touch which I thought helped with the multiple cheeses. Both burgers were packed with ingredients. So much to the point while eating it melted in our hands. Messy eaters unite. Overall great burger, many options and I see why they've won award for their burgers."}
{"text":"Really cute space - two floors + two bars.   Delicious poutine, AMAZING sangria.   Quick service and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger (blue burger), great service, great decor and location!  Would love to come try another burger here!"}
{"text":"Perfectly located. Serves good burgers and reasonable prices. It's good food in a chill atmosphere. 4 or 5 stars are reserved for truly great restaurants, this place is definitely above average but nothing to be wowed.   Food : the food is nothing short of satisfying. You have the simple burgers or the outstandingly American style over the top burgers, which are also awesome. Good selection of cocktails.  Service : lots of flare, very nice and fast. Kudos  Decor/ambiance : nothing crazy, but you definitely do get the \"bar\" vibe. Very cool."}
{"text":"Onion rings, a garden salad and tea was $30 it really wasn't all that good, service is okay. Perhaps burgers are their primary expertise. Wasn't really a fan of this place. It took 30-45mins for simple foods."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BURGER PLACE IN MONTREAL.. great taste, good quality meat and awesome combinations..!"}

{"text":"Pas d'avis lors de notre première visite. Il est temps de le faire alors pour la seconde visite:)  Je n'ai pas l'habitude de venir dans le quartier pour manger, nous sommes venus découvrir le Burger Bar Crescent qui avait une bonne réputation pour manger burger, poutine ... Nous étions venus la première fois avant d'aller voir un match du Canadien au centre Bell. C'est à mon gout son principal avantage car ce n'est pas loin et c'est devenu un peu un rituel maintenant avant d'aller au centre Bell:)  Nous avons bien sur pris un burger accompagné de frites. Le mien était avec boeuf, saucisse italienne, pesto, olive noire.Le tout ensemble était très bon. Les frites bonnes. Celui de Laura était plus classique (bacon en plus de fromage salade et tomate) avec une boulette végétarienne (légume et lentille). La boulette était un peu sèche malheureusement et il manquait un peu de sauce justement pour contrer cette sécheresse. J'ai goutté et c'était tout de même bon. Le bacon n'était pas super, dommage.  Cette fois ci le service n'était pas extraordinaire. Je pense que ce n'est un de leur point fort. Mais bon on n'y va pas pour ça particulièrement.  La première fois nous avions vraiment aimé donc en moyenne sur ces 2 visites les 4* sont de mise.  A bientôt Burger Bar, vivement le prochain match de HNL ou NBA :)"}
{"text":"Good little spot for a gourmet burger. I had their Firestorm, covered in hot pepper  assortment. It was very tasty, not simply hot- an important distinction.  I also has real dark malt vinegar for my fries- a winning combination in my book.  Like everywhere in Montreal, the whiskey pours are stingy. I forget that every time I come. But the Guineas draft was cool and frothy.  Very good service, loved watching the burgers lined up at the kitchen for distribution."}
{"text":"Ok, j'y ai été deux fois en plus de les avoir découvert au Oysterfest l'an dernier et je peux dire que leurs burgers sont pas mal les meilleurs en ville! (Et je prends pas ça à la légère!) Le pain est vraiment bon, la viande est juteuse, le bacon est croustillant à point et les garnitures choisies les deux fois dans mon cas étaient parfaites!!   Les frites maison sont très bonnes et pour 1$ peuvent être accompagnées d'une mayonnaise savoureuse (ail, piquante, dijonnaise, aux truffes, wasabi, etc). Pour un choix un peu plus léger, vous pouvez prendre une salade verte ou une salade de chou que je recommande fortement!  Le service était excellent les deux fois, très patient, très bonne connaissance du menu et même s'ils étaient anglophones, nous ont servi en français tout le long. Mes amis ont aussi été très satisfaits de leur expérience.  Propre, délicieux et très accueillant, que voulez-vous de plus?"}
{"text":"Good food but poor service hour plus for burgers means either insufficient staff or bad management n the kitchen. Nice wait staff ServEd by inadequate kitchen"}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious and service was great. I had the hangover burger and I definitely understand why. Egg, poutine, bacon, foir gras, and Quebec cheese curds, how can you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"Nice place.   I opted for the shroom burger with a black bean patty and my hubby opted the Dude burger. My burger is full of flavor, nicely grilled mushrooms (different kinds), and the black bean patty is so good (great gal or, texture and full of beans). My hubby tried the chicken wings ($1 for one during happy hour) and he loves both the wings and the burger.   Nice service as well. They don't have a dessert menu and you need to ask the waiter or waitress."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in Montreal. The burgers are unique and the best I have had. The individual ingredients defiantly taste top quality and sum to greatness. My only complaint is the cost of drinks.... if you want pop you need to pay over $4 for a small glass bottle and no refills. And they don't warn you so watch out!"}
{"text":"First off I hardly ever write a positive review.  The food was good and the atmosphere was great.   I'm writing this review about my waitress. I believe her name was Jasmine or Juelz (it was something with a J. I apologize it was about a month ago and her name escapes me). She was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. My friend and I were in town for the night and looking for a bite to eat and we stumbled in.   Our waitress was extremely helpful with our questions about the area and was able to recommend a few bars for us and areas for us to sight see.   She was extremely friendly and courteous and because of this, I will recommend this restaurant to my friends traveling to Montreal."}
{"text":"Le Burger Bar mon petit coup de cur pour les burgers! Je m'y suis déjà rendue à plusieurs occasions et pour ma part, je n'ai jamais été déçue! Leurs hamburgers sont un délice, la viande est de qualité et fond en bouche. En accompagnement on a le choix entre des frites à la patate douce ou une salade verte/salade de choux. Personnellement quand je mange un hamburger, je prends toujours la portion de frites, et je peux vous dire, en tant que belge, nondidju qu'elles sont bonnes leurs frites! Par contre, ayez l'estomac bien grand car les quantités ne sont pas moindres! On en a pour notre argent!   Le tout se déroulant dans une ambiance agréable et légèrement tamisée, un ptit fond de musique et un personnel bien sympathique.   Un petit conseil, si vous êtes plusieurs(plus de 2 ou 4), le mieux est de réserver car c'est un endroit qui a du succès.   Enfin, tout ce que je peux vous dire c'est : GO! Testez le! C'est un incontournable!"}
{"text":"The service was AWFUL!! let me elaborate:   1. we tried to use Groupon we had by showing it via our smart phone. They said we needed it printed out or they won't accept it. so the suggestion was 'either give them the printed version or COME BACK OTHER TIME'  2. the server spilled my coke all over the table and never give me another bottle or any refill  3. our Groupon promotion states that we are supposed to get 12 chicken wings. Only 9 were served. When we asked the server, she said that they 'go by pounds, not numbers' Seriously? how should we believe that?   4. It took a long time to get a check even though there were enough servers that we almost missed our movie  5. Unsatisfied with the service, we barely left any tips. When the server saw that, she said 'DON'T COME BACK' to our face.   FYI, I will NOT BE GOING BACK THERE. Never mind the food."}
{"text":"Amazing Burger's, Amazing Poutine, Amazing ambiance  The \"big mac\"burger is a must try, it was the highlight of our visit. the poutine was the best!!"}
{"text":"The staff were fantastic from the moment we opened the door, and the meal was so good that we asked to visit the kitchen to share our appreciation.   We had two bison burgers, the mushroom/Brie (#1 you have to order) and the blue cheese bison burger (still delicious). We started with cheese sticks and apple/bacon soup (om nom). Definitely ask for the dark German beer!  The burgers were insanely good. Juicier than you've ever had, you can tell from the flavor that it was never frozen, and you can order them mid rare and they actually get served mid rare!! Fries get cut on location and are blanched to perfection. Even perfectly spiced.   I'll keep this short and sweet, service was incredible (mark and marine), the food blew my companions mind (he's only missing China/Australia on his culinary visits list) - and he has a usually expensive pallet and the entire experience was not only memorable but will be quoted until this friendship dies.   Skip the apps and grab the Bison Brie burger. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great burger place with a lot of interesting a different burgers to choose from. They have different kinds of meats for burgers, so there's definitely something for everyone. Other than burgers, the menu has many different options with things like poutines, sandwiches, and more. A decent cocktail menu too. Service was quick and our waitress was very nice and prompt, always making sure our glasses were full and that our food was good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good burger. We found two. What was interesting was they weren't your everyday burgers. The burger selections were numerous and many were unique. For example: I had the BaBa Burger. In addition to a good sized burger it had grilled red pepper, grilled onion, grilled zucchini , grilled portobello mushroom, and grilled eggplant. See....unique and very good. The burgers were accompanied by a large helping of fries. We also managed a large piece of chocolate bourbon pecan pie with chocolate ice cream on the side. We had reservations and were seated immediately. The service was great, friendly, and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I had out Friday dinner here.  Didn't have to wait for a table, that was super nice.  The burger was really tasty. I had québécois burger with onion ring. I like their bun especially, very soft.  The atmosphere was pretty great too, the music wasn't overwhelming loud.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because their sweet potato fries wasn't crispy."}
{"text":"Super-cramped. A nice variety of interesting sounding burgers made it difficult to narrow down choices for lunch.  Everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"There is nothing anyone can say not to go here. It is a must for burger lovers every where! I personally had the \"Hangover\" burger and it was about a footlong burger very difficult to eat but so very worth it. They have all types of different types of burgers and meats. It is very nice for a medium sized party or a cute date for two. Try the Hangover burger !!"}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé mon hamburger assez fade et ordinaire. Celui de mon copain était meilleur par contre ! Les choix sont originaux et les prix sont corrects. J'ai moins aimé l'ambiance et le lieu. J'ai aussi trouvé le service assez bon. J'avais de très hautes attentes et j'ai été un peu déçue, mais c'était sommes toute assez bon!"}
{"text":"These guys serve custom-designed, chef-prepared, haute-cuisine burgers. If I were a god, I would make this a sin. It can be that good. What I love the most about burger bar is the variety of choices, what makes you go back for new experiences. There are \"easier\", more basic burgers as well as \"advanced\", more sophisticated burgers like the one with blue cheese and confit fruits. The menu also rotates over time, so try not to miss a recipe that you would like to taste. And don't forget to order the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Petit resto d'hamburgers comme on enr etrouve tant à Montréal. Très grand choix. J'ai opté pour un classique, bacon fromage. Les portions sont gigantesques. Nous étions un dizaine dans le resto à l'heure où nous y avons été et je dirais qu'au moins 5 personnes ont commandé le hangover qui est un hamburger standard evec un poutine et un oeuf frit. J'avais proposé ce choix à mon conjoint, pendant que la poutine venait en accompagnant, mais quand nous avons vous les plats passés, la poutine est bien dans LE BURGER. Impossible de le manger comme un hamburger normal, pas le choix de le \"dé-étagé\". J'aime le côté imaginatif mais je préfère ma poutine \"on-the-side\"."}
{"text":"With the family in Montreal looking for a place with good poutine and burgers. This place exceeded expectations. They had a wide range of gourmet burgers. So many it was hard to choose. They were piled high and had the option for a side of poutine. There were no kids meals, but my daughters were able to split a burger and still had generous portions. Would definitely come back if in the area again. The food was amazing. Had a ton to bring home as leftovers too."}
{"text":"I walked in on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed, there was two open seats to the bar and that was it. There was no one at the desk, and despite making eye contact with multiple staff, we were not greeted. We aimlessly walked around the standing waiting area for a couple minutes, maybe the host was busy or it was a seat yourself situation. Still nothing. A couple walked in and right past us, they were greeted and told about the wait time etc. The only reason this isn't a 1 star is because i can't accurately asses the quality of food as we never had the opportunity to taste it. We left after waiting even a little while longer and not being greeted or approached."}
{"text":"fantastic two-floor burger joint on a street full of bars, clubs, and restaurants.  i got the boss burger which features cheese, bacon, dijon mayonnaise, lettuce tomato, and the very reason why i chose it: a runny over-easy egg.  the patty was cooked perfectly (medium), the bun was some buttery delicious goodness, and all the ingredients meshed well together.  i also got to try a bit of the bison burger which was phenomenal with a great dense texture, and the jack daniel's bbq burger which was pretty by-the-books but quite good.  i really enjoyed my meal here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a dependable burger.  oh also the fries here are perfect"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a good burger place (Americans in Montreal) and this place delivered! The inside is small (upstairs and downstairs) and the balcony seats maybe 4/5 groups of 4 but there is a full bar and the menu is excellent. Options for vegetarians and MANY for meat lovers, (mac n cheese, burgers, poutine, and salads available). If you have any special accommodations be sure to ask the waiter and they will happily accommodate you."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Loli and I believe I have fallen in love with the Burger Bar. It all started one afternoon when my dear lumberjack and I had a lovely time walking through Mont Royal. We mainly stopped for a drink and a quick snack before hopping on the Metro.  Once inside, I knew we had chosen well. The background music was just that- background music, the decor was simple but trendy, and I saw the food being served at another table. (Only my sternly engraved manners kept me from helping myself to their food. The burgers looked fantastic!)  Since we were only there for a snack- we ordered the soup du jour (an onion soup) and a grilled chorizo potato salad to share. The soup was fantastic! It was everything that a french onion soup should be and proved to be very difficult to share. The grilled chorizo potato salad with corn was a delightful mix of tastes. I am not ashamed to admit how giddy I was to feel the crunch of green onions in my bites. Green onions + potatoes+ chorizo = lots of Loli's mouth happiness  I am only sorry that I live so far away and that the Burger Bar and I cannot be married. I would be such a happy Loli if I could enjoy this much goodness everyday- but alas, it cannot be. I will miss you, Burger Bar :,("}
{"text":"Not from the city so we found this place from Yelp! This place is fantastic! The food was fresh, it came at a good time,we didn't have to wait long. The service was superb!  We had I believe his name was Ben! He was great with us, he was funny and sarcastic, we def enjoyed him as our waiter. All the staff worked together, helped each other out with other tables and refilling waters, they seemed like a good team.  I had the special they had which was called \"Super nova Crunch\" which was a chicken breast coated in a panko crumb, with Cheese, this sauce that he claimed was better than mac sauce (it was pretty good), tomatoes, Lettuce, and 2 big thick slices of bacon. Omf it was delicious.  You'll def leave there full. I thought my burger was big, but I seen some other burgers other customers had order and they're even bigger.    Thank you so much guys! It was great! Hope I can come back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good, no Doubt- but memorable? Non. Sat in the corner*  *possibly because we were boisterous Americans? Or possibly because we are gluttons"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Fun ambience, great service, and food that will always fill you up! Usually crowded during the weekends but what else can you expect on Crescent!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers with a modern interior located on one of Montreal's nicer streets- Rue Crescent. Great for big groups or even an intimate dinner. Waiters are friendly and helpful. It's always been packed every time I've gone so be sure to reserve if you're with a larger group.    Also- Get the sweet potato fries. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My favorite gourmet burger place in Montreal. Their menu is great with lots of choices not only for burgers but also for desserts and sides. They offer a wide variety of toppings for every taste. The meat is very good, juicy and tasty with an option to also opt for a bison burger with a superior and tastier patty. The service I would have to say is average, you can wait quite a bit to receive your burger, but it's worth it. Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and decadent poutine.  We had the smoked meat poutine, a flavor craving I never knew I had. What else could you ask for?  How about possibly the best mac n' cheese on the planet and great beers.  Definitley would go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I loved Burger Bar! Their menu is so delicious it was hard to decide on a menu item. I ended up ordering their classic poutine and bacon mac and cheese. It was absolutely heaven! Poutine was good but I have to give an extra special shout out for their amazing in-house made macaroni. Soooo good! Service was great too. The food was out surprisingly quickly.  They have a nice atmosphere inside and we sat outside on their patio where we were able to look out onto the street. It was really nice!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this was the best burger I had in Canada. Burger Bar was a nice spot for my friends and I to grab a bite to eat and hangout after sightseeing all day.  After looking at the menu, I became torn between selecting the Bacon Mac and Cheese or The Boss Burger. Luckily for me, my friend was in the same predicament so we decided to get both and split them. The Bacon Mac and Cheese was delicious! The cheese was perfectly melted with thick slices of bacon throughout the dish made for the perfect Mac and cheese. Next, the Boss Burger had my friends and I dreaming about it for days lol The burger had a 6oz AAA beef patty, American cheese, an over easy fried egg, bacon, Lettuce, tomato, and a Dijon mustard. Sounds pretty simple, but it was amazing! My other friend got her burger with avocado and it looked even better! The burger was served with french fries.  The wait staff were all very friendly and eager to answer any questions or get us whatever we asked for.  If I'm ever back in Montréal, this will definitely be on my list again!"}
{"text":"Their poutine was the best that I have tried! I also had their BBQ wings. It was expensive but still very delicious."}
{"text":"I figured the best way to choose a burger is take one named after one of my favorite movie characters and so, I opted for The Dude. Needless to say, it was great, cooked to perfection. I was warned in advance it would take a little while to make but the friendly staff helped make time go faster.  The entire experience was pretty awesome, especially when Bohemian Rhapsody started playing and everyone joined in singing 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Scrumptious! A great food fair of salads ,hamburgers women with great serving skills!"}
{"text":"This was a great burger. Went here for dinner on a Friday night and got a table right away. I had a Philly Burger with poutine and husband had a Mr Personality with fries. The burgers, the fries, and the poutine were great! (Only time I've had poutine, so nothing to compare it to.)  The service was great, our waitress was so nice and made suggestions based on the most popular and her personal favorites."}
{"text":"The service was very good and the food was very good. The environment was lively and they played very soulful R & B music."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the burger bar in Montreal. After a heavy french meal the night before, it was nice to eat something more familiar and comforting.  As an appetizer, we ordered the calamari (delicious, quite spicy with a nice crunch). For the main courses we got the macaroni and cheese with shrooms as well as the Montreal meat burger.  I was not impressed with the macaroni at all.  The flavor was very one dimensional, and I got tired of it after just a couple of bites.  However, the burger was almost perfect.  The patty was cooked to a medium rare so the meat was juicy and tasteful. One top of the patty was Montreal meat which I'm fairly sure was a salami corn grilled beef. It was yummy and complimented the cheese and the party perfectly.  Service was great and the total came out to be 62 with everything. I wish I could give the burger bar 4 stars, but the macaroni and cheese left me sad and wishing for better food."}
{"text":"As an American I have to say I've been pretty disappointed with most of the burgers I've had in Montreal. I just don't understand why they don't ask what temperature I want my burger cooked, and then cook it to medium well/well done every time. However, Burger Bar DOES ask, and as the first place I've been to that asked (and cooked it to a proper medium rare) they automatically were ahead in my book.   I had the poutine burger, which was really impressive to look at and really delicious to eat. The poutine is kind of like a cylinder of french fries fried together with gravy and cheese curds. I was really impressed with how well it stayed together while I ate it (with a fork and knife.) I got it with a salad instead of fries because that seemed more reasonable. Everyone I ate with also said they enjoyed their burgers.  Our waitress was super nice although the food came out a bit slowly. We went on a Tuesday or Wednesday night so it wasn't very busy at all.   All in all solid burger, and definitely one of the best I've had in the city so far. I'd go back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Great poutine, great burger. Friendly waitress and waiter. It wasn't crowded on a Tuesday evening at 6:00. The burger was tasty, I got the Royale with cheese, fresh tasty bun and meat!"}
{"text":"Friends and I came here as a backup for dinner on Saturday night - heard the burgers were good so we were pretty excited.  I ordered the original \"mr personality\" burger with no cheese, one friend the \"baba\" one the \"jack Daniels burger\" and one the wild shroom (veggie) burger.  First let me say that the waiter was a beautiful man who was quite charming  Next, the portions were HUMONGOUS    The burgers were so big you could not fit your mouth around it. The fries were fresh cut and delicious.  The burger meat was to die for - definitely amazing. All my girlfriends liked their burger (although lots were left because it was so filling) but my veggie friend said her shroom burger was loose and fell apart and was too messy  I do recommend this place but please go on an EMPTY stomach and don't try to eat politely haha  All in all yum but I felt like a beached whale coming home - hence 4 stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Montreal and tried this place for dinner. The burgers were juicy, fresh and excellent. The waitstaff was very attentive and  the seating area was roomy. Perfect for families or friends for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Nestled on a street with many options- Burger bar was perfect for me. Two levels- small yet roomy at the same time. Knowledge bar staff who made great beer recommendations. Went with the Burger bar RED. Went with the BOSS burger ( egg bacon cheese and added balsamic reduction to it - cooked medium ) came out hot, satisfying and went well with my beer. Flat screen tv for sport fans and music playing in background. A nice lunch escape from the Canadian cold. Will be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't get tooooo excited about vegetarian options here - they will make any burger on a veggie patty, but just about all of them also come with smoked meat or bacon or any manner of creature added.   Having said that, they're tasty and everyone at the table seems super pumped. Extra pumped for the burger that comes with poutine on it (fair warning it's veal gravy, which smells pretty phenomenal anyway).   Decent drink selection, reasonable prices, nice and not-too-loud place, and you can fo'sho make the trip worth it with a deep fried Mars bar."}
{"text":"Ended up here two nights in a row. The first night, the kitchen had closed so we got a few drinks, all of which were great. The second night, we got there about 10 minutes before the kitchen closed and managed to order some food. Though we only got two orders of sweet potato fries. The fries were pretty good and the drinks were also well made."}
{"text":"The burger are always excellent, the patties are juicy and flavorful. We have tried the jack daniels, mushrooms this time. The mushroom comes with more vegie, jack daniel have a better source, but cannot go wrong with either. It is a great place to go the qunch those meaty burger craving. You will leave the place feeling satisfied and a tiny bit guilty. The alcohol choose is limited, but they do have good beers. The service was good both time we went. The decor is average, brick wall interior and dimmed lighting."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and got seated right away at 9 pm. The waitress was super friendly. I ordered the crunchy chicken and my fiancé got the lobster Mac and cheese that was a special. We also shared the spicy poutine. Everything was great! However I do not recommend the spicy poutine as it was more peppers than fries."}
{"text":"The place has a good atmosphere, and the food is very good. A little pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Just go.  Right now.  Seriously. It's amazing.  I had not eaten meat in three months and although I planned on ending my meat fast across the street at Dundees (see my review on them for why that did not happen), luckily the food gods intervened and my friend and I found our way to Burger Bar.  I welcome myself back into the meat world with a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was amazing.  The meat was perfectly cooked and the buns were delicious.  Even the side salad that comes with it is perfectly dressed with an AWESOME dressing (orange honey vinaigrette maybe?) and some very fresh mixed greens.  The ambience is perfect, the servers are great and the food is simply spectacular.  The menu is completely in French (which I think is awesome) and the poutine is phenomenal (the best I tasted in Montreal-the cheese curds are super fresh). They also have a cool bar and a small outdoor area.    DO yourself a favor and go now!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The minimalist decor reminds me of a New York city type eatery. They have beer on tap or bottle, and quite an interesting variety of burgers. My burger was AMAZING!!! I asked for a side of guacamole and mayo and they had no problem accommodating my request. The sweet potato fries were incredibly good. The service was attentive and friendly. If you're really in the mood for dessert, try the chocolate shake--it's perfect!"}
{"text":"The burgers here were average. I tried the veggie burger and found the consistency to be a little too soft and quite difficult to eat with how highly piled the other toppings were. Then saving grace were the fiery peppers and sauce that came in my burger and really added the flavour. My tablemate enjoyed the beef burger with wild mushrooms but also felt that it was nothing special. The service was fantastic and all of the staff was extremely friendly! I wouldn't go out of my way to go again but maybe if I'm around crescent I'd pop in!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Jack Daniel's burger after conquering Mont Royal!!!  Good wings as well."}
{"text":"Well I went back again and there was a serious and hard to forgive lack of consistency. This time the burger was overcooked, the meat chewy and greyish. The onion rings were soggy with grease. And I tried the Mac n Cheese which left me wondering, who stole my cheese? Therefore I must downgrade my rating. Consistency is a key element in restoration."}
{"text":"Great find! Pleasant atmosphere with a look on crescent street if you get those cute tables by the window upstairs. The food was excellent! First time trying bison meat & was not disappointed! My partner stayed conservative with beef but also loved it! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the dude Burger.   It is awesome and just get the egg on it and don't ask questions.   You'll love it.  Wash it down with a maudite.  You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I went to Burger Bar Crescent during a recent visit to the city with my family.  We picked this place out after extensive reading on yelp, urbanspoon, and tripadvisor.   We had narrowed our choice down to Mister Steer,  Patati Patata, and Burger Bar Crescent.   We decided on Burger Bar Crescent because it offered both poutine (we were poutine virgins), high end burgers, and mac and cheese for my daughter.  So we headed off to Crescent Street on a Friday night to check it out.   The street was buzzing with energy, as it is clearly one of hot spots in the city for night life.   As soon as we stepped in we were greeted by a what I can only describe as a stud.   My wife would later comment - \"I think he made my ovaries drop.\"   As we continued to our table it was clear the place was full of beautiful people.   And to add to the backdrop, the music in the background was a steady stream of smooth club music.   I'm way past my clubbing days, but we were all enjoying the vibe.    We looked over the menu which had a nice selection of burgers and apps.   The prices were a little high, but given the location we knew this wasn't going to be a cheap eats place.     For our order we decided on poutine, two burgers, mac and cheese, and drinks, including a Keith's Indian Pale Ale for myself.     Both my wife and I are big burger lovers, and are very much set on having our burgers cooked rare or medium rare.   I for one will just opt for something else if it can't be cooked to order.    I had some doubts about this reading the reviews, as nobody made a comment regarding this.    Luckily the waiter explained that the burgers usually come cooked medium or well, but they can be cooked to order.  So... my wife ordered her burger medium rare, and I ordered mine rare.     After we gave our order, the waiter repeated everything back to us just to make sure he had it right.   A good sign.     Here's where we go from things go from four stars down to three...    A few minutes later the drinks arrived.   My wife's received a Coke (which came in an old school bottle) instead of the Diet Coke she ordered, and I received some type of light beer (which was still good), instead of the Keith's IPA.   The waiter wasn't around, so we just settled and grooved to the tunes.    Soon the poutine arrived.   Because it was our first time having it, I can't say where it stacks up, but it tasted pretty good.   We were all instantly hooked on the dish.  Next came the main meals.   The presentation of the food was top notch.  The food looked beautiful.   But it only took one bite for all of us to get the let down.   Both burgers were cooked medium to medium well.   Ugh...  My daughter didn't like her mac and cheese either, she didn't like the flavor of the cheese.   My wife tasted it and thought much the same.        It was a little sad to end up with such a mediocre and pricy experience after putting in so much effort on the research, but the atmosphere helped to take the edge off.   Next time we'll probably hit one of the other places we looked at instead."}
{"text":"Best poutine ever! So delicious! My boyfriend and I came here during our short stay in Montreal. He's a burger fan so we had to get his fix. He really enjoyed the burger here. His order came with the pulled pork poutine which was heaven in my mouth! I ordered the chicken nachos which were pretty good. Service was great here and drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while visiting Montreal and so glad we found it.  Excellent experience all around.  Food was great and service was too and the atmosphere is just what I like in a restaurant.  The pitcher of delicious sangria I shared with one dining partner made after lunch shopping more fun!"}
{"text":"Recently was on vacation in Montreal, and enjoyed my burger experience here... considering I've ate burgers from all over the place.  I went with the Hangover Burger and was more than delighted with the amount of food!  Loved the poutine!  Paired off my meal with a bottle of La Fin Du Monde.  Definitely worth the visit!  Thanks to Nastassia for serving us Americans... (i hope i remembered how to spell her name right!)"}
{"text":"Cool place. Great burgers. Decent pricing. Nice service. I'll be back ! They have tv's and good beer as well besides the place they are known for \"burgers \""}
{"text":"Honestly the best mac n' cheese I've ever had, and I've had A LOT in my life. The staff was great and we had a lot of fun! Again, order the mac n' cheese it's to die for."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I really wanted to get the Blue Candy Bison burger but unfortunately they were out of some of the ingredients. So I ordered the wild mushroom, Brie burger with caramelized leeks. It's was really yummy. Piping hot, just perfect. Got the burgerbar lemonade which was good and then I tried the zombie which was amazing and strong! All and all the meal was satisfying and delicious in a fun casual environment."}
{"text":"My experience was awful here my bf and i came we order two burgers one was cold and the other was drenched in oil we thought the waiter was super nice to us until we payed the bill and she wasn't satisfied with her tip. So as we left we said goodbye leaving and she gave us a stank attitude with a horrible look cause she was unsatisfied. TIPS ARE EARNED she was piss due to her stupid tip !  DONT GO HERE rude customer service !!"}
{"text":"On voulait du comfort food cette journée-là et on a décidé d'aller au burger bar crescent.   C'est un resto de 2 étages proche du Concordia, qui offre des burgers, sandwiches, poutines, boissons, etc. Belle ambiance et service chaleureuse. Le resto était plein quand on est allé. La bouffe était bonne aussi.  Burgers entre 13$ à 27$, et viennent avec une salade ou des frites. J'ai pris un sandwich porc effiloché et mon chum a pris le \"dude\" les deux étaient délicieux. j'ai aussi bien aimé le old fashioned drink. Je retournerai sûrement pour essayer d'autres burgers~"}
{"text":"Fun, friendly waiter and awesome food.  The French onion soup is delicious with the addition of bacon. Burgers were delicious.  The hangover burger  was a monstrous hit!!  We were warned that the buffalo wings were very spicy, but they were reasonably hot and the blending of the bleu cheese into the buffalo sauce was tasty!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, great food, great service, great beer. Their burgers were cooked perfectly, and come with gourmet toppings, there is something for everyone. Their calamari was also very good, served with a nice chipotle dip.  The water service was top notch, if that's what you're looking for in a restaurant, go here! the second you take a sip out of your glass he is there with the pitcher filling it up, he was the real hero!"}
{"text":"Les burgers sont bons, la Poutine est bonne, la musique est bonne, l'ambiance est bonne, 5*****!!"}
{"text":"Having been seated near the kitchen, you could see and hear that the cooks know what they're doing when it comes to grilling meat. That being said, this is a far cry from being my favorite burger, let alone a place I'd return to.  The problem is the burgers are EXPENSIVE. When I dish out $15+ for a burger, it had better be a Lark Creek steakburger, or something like one. These burgers are good, but the quality toppings mask what is essentially just generic beef with too little seasoning. I expect more for this price.  Beside the burgers, the cheese sticks are fantastic. Panko-breaded with salsa for dipping; they're a perfect appetizer. They also have some choice beers on tap, including a few Keith's like the Blond and IPA.  I liked Burger Bar, but I really wanted to like it more. When your bill comes out to $60 though and you don't feel like you've been blown away by the meat, you've got to call a spade a spade and move on."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the entire world hands down. The hangover burger is the most amazing combo of yumminess ever!"}
{"text":"I could shout it from the hill tops. What a burger!! (Or two in this case)  Visiting Montreal with the wife. Usual debate raging about which restaurants to hit up, which of the the old favorites we can't afford to miss, and what new spots to try.   This place is close to the hotel we were staying and the subject of many good reviews so hopefully I'll have something to add.  The ambience: casual, friendly, warm. Basic wooden table and chairs arrangement with brick wall and some prints on the walls. We were seated at a window seat by our server Mark. He was awesome. Friendly, engaging, and full of suggestions. Perfect service.  Skipped appetizers and ordered some tap water and a coke to go with my burger. (Old school style)  Burger 1: Foie Gras with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Amazing. The Caramel richness coupled with the juicy patty (which was cooked medium -ish and tasted perfect) was perfectly complimented by the onions and mushrooms. This was my favourite  Burger 2: The Firestorm burger. Hot hot hot!! But flavourful and not too much heat where you can't enjoy it. The jalapeño, banana peppers, and spicy sauce go great with the flavourful patty. For Le piece de resistance I added a fried egg to my burger. Wow! If you don't mind a bit of heat you can't go wrong with this burger.  The Sides: Cole slaw: vinegar based, light, refreshing, tasty. Enjoyed by us both even the wife who doesn't particularly care for slaw Poutin: no complaints. Came out a bit cooler than I'd like but otherwise fine. We barely ate it since the burgers are so big.   Conclusion: premium burgers. Reasonable prices. Casual, friendly setting with great service and a good turn around time. This is exactly what it needs to be - a fun, messy, tasty experience enjoying a burger."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but rounding up because I'm feeling generous. I am very finnicky when it comes to burgers (everything is judged against Burgatory!), so Burger Bar Crescent was just okay for me. It was good, but not amazing. I would go back and maybe try something else (I had the Yosemite Sam burger with sweet potato fries) to see if they can wow me. Portions were ample, which is always nice. What really jumped out at me was the great service. I've noticed a lot of the places I have dined at in Montreal have pretty awful service, but not Burger Bar. Our server was SUPER helpful and bent over backwards to make sure we were satisfied. I was impressed that they have 19 crimes red blend on their wine list, which is one of my favorites that I've never seen on a restaurant menu before. They have indoor and outdoor seating and heat lamps on the balcony. If you don't mind getting some secondhand smoke from people puffing away below, definitely sit outside for a great view of the action on the street while you dine!"}
{"text":"I had the \"The Boss\" burger and it was mediocre. I asked for medium but the burger was cooked to be definitely medium well. I may be super critical because I have been spoiled with all the burger joints in Chicago (Umami & Au Cheval). If you are visiting Montreal this is definitely a pass! It does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Food was alright and bad thing is that the food took long to come out despite the waitress being extremely nice"}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic, the poutine was delicious, and the drinks were great. Everyone had a great time, and the food was 100% worth the money. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgable and loved his job. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Probably the best I've ever had. Menu is pretty extensive for a burger place. It's a cozy place...I was seated upstairs by a window overlooking Crescent Street.  Nice place to grab a bite and a drink. Great service!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burger to hit the spot. The. This is it! I was visiting for a conference and I was craving for a good juicy burger. Walked around and just found this gem. My phone was dead, so i couldn't check in or take photos. But mark my words, this place had a great burger, better than some other burger joints I've eaten at. My burger was prepped perfectly, I got the burger called The Boss, which comes with 6 oz. Of AAA beef, good American cheese, bacon and that beautiful fried over easy egg on it. I held the dinon mayo, as I don't like mayo and I threw in some red onions and my goodness; it was so so good that I cut in in quarters just to enjoy it longer, lol. Bite after bite of flavor packed in such goodness.  I was greedy with this place, I even got the decadent Poutine which has confit duck and foie grass. This nearly pit me in a food coma; from all it deliciousness and richness.  To top it all off, I had a great vanilla milk shake.  Over all a good food experience. Staff was very friendly. I will he going back!!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciate that the owner contacted me after my experience here. I have been here twice and was not pleased on either occasion, as I felt the burgers were greasiest and less appealing than the plethora of alternative burger options in the neighborhood (the burger market in Montreal seems to be Saturated both downtown and in the Plateau). That Being said, my palate is not the Gordon Ramsey of yelp, so you are encouraged to still try"}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant if you are a burger fan. Their appetizers are pretty awesome (beer battered onion rings)...drool. Their staff are very friendly, know the menu really well and are good at giving suggestions. They have interesting drinks and some insany burgers! If you have a big appetite like me, try the poutine burger..yup you heard right..poutine burger. The firestorm burger is awesome if you like spicy, but not so spicy that its not edible."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends bday and we ordered different kind of burgers,  Its was so good! My friends love it.."}
{"text":"This pretty much sums it up: awesome food, awesome beer, awesome service. Yes, it's expensive, but the service alone more than makes up for it. This was by far the best eating experience I had in Montreal."}
{"text":"First of all, we are from Boston, Massachusetts & we come to Montreal every couple of years. The Burger Bar is a must when we come up. We try to go 3 out of 4 days we stay. Their classic poutine is by far the best we have  had!  We haven't tried their other ones they make yet. They have amazing looking options for poutine  in their menu though.   I tend to get my fill on the poutine with every visit, but my husband finds the burgers phenomenal! They don't call it \"The Burger Bar\" for nothing! They make Gourmet Burgers with a quality that cannot be compared!! Next the drinks....  They make awesome drinks! They can if you need it like I do, explain the drinks at length to help you decide what you would like best.  And they can predict what you would love just from telling them what you enjoy! We always sit at the bar because we enjoy the bartenders very much.  In 2012 we were served by Ben & Marine. They were terrific! This year we had the pleasure of seeing Marine again at the bar! So cool to remember people from many miles & a few years ago! We also met Mathilde & Gabrielle a night later.  Both were very awesome!   We hope to come back in the summer or fall & see our friends at Burger Bar!"}
{"text":"Must try the Bacon Royale. You will not be disappointed. The burger had a blend of three cheeses and the meat was cooked to perfection.  Our server was great as well. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love burger bar! Their drinks are amazing and so affordable... it's only $2 extra for a double!! You might as well order a double, just saying! They have the best long island iced teas I've ever had!   Basically everything is good! The poutines and burgers are amazing! My go to burgers are the supersonic and the brie and mushroom burger. The sweet potato fries are so good and I'm not usually a person who orders sweet potato fries! I recently just tried their chicken wings. These wings are pretty big! There's a lot of meat on there and it does fall off the bone. My only complaint is that some wings have a strong chicken taste.   Also the staff is so nice! I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Cute little place on a amazing street w/ lots of choices so hangover burger was amazing awesome had everything top 5 burgers I've have ever really enjoyed !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service in that the servers were nice, non-cheesy, and very helpful.  Bilingual.  I had the Quebecois burger which was excellent.  Poutine was tasty, fries were crispy and not soggy.  My wife had a fried chicken sandwich, kids had burgers, mac and cheese, and calamari - all of which was yummy.    Excellent location in the heart of downtown; it was a super quick walk to the Bell Center to watch a Habs game.   My only complaint was that the Burger Bar Red Ale was a little more \"watery\" than I would have liked in a beer.  I was hoping for something with a little more body.  I'll happily go back."}
{"text":"Le hamburger aux champignons sauvages est absolument délicieux divin Le dessert au cheese cake original !"}
{"text":"J'ai décidé d'aller à ce restaurant pour mon 27e anniversaire et je ne suis pas très déçu du choix. Malheureusement, la musique était insupportable et les tables inconfortables et comme toutes les foutus restaurants sur Crescent, c'est très difficile d'être servit en français sans qu'un employé baragouine de quoi dans la langue de molière mais comme par hasard un anglais est capable d'avoir du service en parfait anglais, bravo.   Le choix des hamburgers est très impressionnant et les prix varient selon les ingrédients et votre budget, soit entre 14$ à 25$ si je me souviens bien. J'ai bien aimé la taille des hamburgers et des ingrédients très intéressants, tous autant délicieux à lire sur la carte du menu mais leur maudite portion de frites ou de poutine est minuscule, c'mon, je suis venu me bourrer la face, pas faire une diète minceur. J'ai pas pris d'entrée mais l'un de mes amis a partagé des bâtonnets de fromages frit....maudit que c'était bon.   J'ai pris un pichet de bière artisanale fait par Burger Bar et je l'ai sérieusement dégusté et appris à l'aimer. Malheureusement, 19$ pour un pichet de 60 oz c'est TRÈS discutable comme prix.  Pour une soirée drôle entre amis et mes frères, j'ai payé 27$ pour mon repas principal et un pichet de bière partagé à trois. Je crois que pour le prix, ça en vaut la chandelle mais sérieusement....il faut réduire le maudit son des speakers et des subs. J'étais même pas capable de m'entendre parler, encore moins mes amis et mes frères. En plus, pour votre critère d'embauche, vous devriez sérieusement exiger un bilinguisme parfait. Il faut pas exiger de l'anglais avec option français niveau 1. Pour le reste c'était géniale. À conseiller pour amateur de hamburger."}
{"text":"Love that place, burgers are very tasty and big enough to feed you. The jack daniel's poutine is my favourite"}
{"text":"I had the Wild Shroom Burger. I chose this because I love mushrooms. With that said, this burger was bombbbbb. Also, red sangria was delicious."}
{"text":"I am so glad I do not live anywhere close to this place, I would be fat and never leave. The first thing staff blew me away with how nice they are, but the star of this restaurant is the food. It was so damn good I came here 2 times in a 4 day vacation. I highly recommend the supersonic burger. Every bite is a different flavor combination that leaves you wanting more. Even through that the protein really shines through.  The poutine was also delicious and worth the upgrade.  Thank you Burger Bar for the good food and great time.  Will be back again and again every time I come to Montréal."}
{"text":"Until stopping in at Burger Bar, I was under the impression that meal times in Montreal were lingering ordeals where waiters/waitresses served at a leisurely pace. Frankly, it was getting on my nerves. Here at Burger Bar, service was speedy, getting me and my friend fed and out the door for more sight seeing in a timely manner.   The food at Burger Bar is great too, nice and fresh and huge portions. Burger Bar gave me my first (and only) experience with poutine. I have to say I still would prefer cheese fries, but I was happy with this Canadian staple. Served in a bowl and slopping with gravy, the bottom got pretty soggy, but I guess that is the nature of the dish. When it came to choosing an entree, the menu was good size and there are a few chicken options for those who don't want/eat red meat and some salad options for those who refrain from animals of any sort.   The side salad I got in place of fries was just a bowl of lettuce which I found a bit strange. No carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes.. ya know, the usual veggies you would find in a salad. Didn't matter much though because the main event was huge and stacked high with yummy goodness. My friend's side fries were a heaping portion, enough for me to steal a few. For about $15, I walked out stuffed."}
{"text":"If I could bring back one thing from my friend's bachelor party besides the gorgeous ladies, it would be this.  This may be one of, if not, the best burger I've ever had.  Before I begin, Burger Bar Crescent isn't for dainty little individuals or fussy health freaks who worry about the slight ounce of \"oil\" dripping from their burger.  First off, these burgers are diesel.  The burger patty is thick, juicy, well-seasoned with a kick of pepper, and always cooked medium.  I got the \"Goliath\"  which came with TWO flavorful patties, bacon, cheese, topped off with lettuce and tomatoes and a side of fries.  The burger was almost the height of my head- I didn't know how to begin eating it.  A friend who also ordered it had to take one whole patty out because the burger was simply too big.  However you decide to eat it (as long as you aren't dissecting the burger) will not matter because these burgers are the real deal.     Even after drooling on my keyboard from just writing this review, I can only give this 4 stars simply because of the service.  The waitress, who was also quite attractive like most of Montreal, was rather inattentive and had some attitude problem.    Nonetheless, these burgers are amazing.  It's a bit pricey ($12-$18) but definitely worth it.  The atmosphere of the place was very nice as well so that was a plus.  Good place, great burgers, beautiful people- just try to get on the good side of the waitress and enjoy."}
{"text":"Burger Bar scores very high on good ideas, but sadly, there's a lot of room for improvement comes execution time. That pretty much sums up my dinner experience there recently.  All four of us were so excited about the menu and had a hard time deciding which burger to pick. Indeed everything sounded so adventurous and delicious!  I was particularly attracted by the `Supersonic` which promised onion rings on top of the burger, although in the end settled for the Jack Daniel`s BBQ burger (what can I say... I love dem bacon strips). The others picked the Wild `Shrooms, Bison and Sicilian.   My BBQ burger was not great and I believe it may have to do with the fact that it was served lukewarm (though we were seated right in front of the kitchen and could see the lineup of burgers waiting to be distributed to the tables). The cheese was melted, but it was no longer hot. The beef patty, which should be a burger's centre of attention, could barely hold its own taste.  The sauce was alright, but could be a little sweeter (I realize this is totally a personal taste thing). The buns... did nothing to improve the overall taste. The only silver lining in the cloud was the bacon strip, which was appropriately crispy and juicy at the same time.   After we finished our respective burgers, I made a comment, as politely as possible, `Well, my burger was alright, but... ` Two of them quickly chimed in with similar comments. At least one of us really liked their dinner - that's the one who ordered the bison burger.  The fries were alright, certainly not memorable. The chicken wings with bbq sauce were unforgiveably bland.  The mixed green salad, on the other hand, was fresh and bountiful.    I was disappointed with the food, but we still had a decent time there. The place was comfortable, the servers were friendly and the washroom clean. Oh well... nobody's perfect, and Burger Bar is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"A nice burger bar in general. I went there with a friend during lunch time. It was quite calme at that time but still the first floor was full. I tried Hangover Burger. It tasted good! It would be better it is more hot. The service is good too. I may come back to try the mushroom, froid gras, beef burger."}
{"text":"The food was okay. But this place is way overrated. The burger patty is not tasty at all."}
{"text":"My fiancé eats burgers all over when we travel. He said this is in the top 5 burger meals he's ever had and he considers himself a burger expert. I had the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster was a little scarce but the flavor was excellent. The service was great and we had an all around very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Damnit I was so mad when I ate here. Why? Because the burger was a perfect medium rare, tasted beyond incredible. Everything was amazing. It was beyond comparison. Better than Ramsay's BURGR at Vegas, and seriously better than anything I've had in California.   Ugh....I was visually upset with my server that I wanted to know how they made the meat, how it was cooked, etc. At first he thought I didn't like the food, but it was beyond comparison. A night before leaving Montreal, went back here. They overcooked it pretty bad....but the 2nd time it was solid. Wonder about consistency issues here...so giving you all a word of caution...but their customer service is beyond incredible. I loved this place. Will always be going here next time I'm lucky enough to be in Montreal."}
{"text":"best burgers ive had period! ate twice here back to back when i was in montreal im from ny! (goliath is OMG!)"}
{"text":"Great burgers. I had the Jack Daniels BBQ. Delicious. They have Red Stripe. Only issue was they were out of onion soup. My wife has a garlic sensitivity which was gladly accommodates. No complaints. Server was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I had Le dude and my friends got the Royal bacon cheese. We split it in half so we can have a taste of each burger. And to be honest I prefered the Royal bacon cheese over Le dude. I found Le dude a bit too greasy and dry at the same time because there wasn't any vegetables in it. On the other side the Royal bacon cheese burger was so refreshing and flavourful! I love it . Would totally return for this burger!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal I was looking for a good burger and found this.   Did not disappoint and will be back on future visits"}
{"text":"I'd like to give Burger Bar a 3 1/2 star since it wasn't a 4 star kind of gourmet burger place.  But since you can't give 1/2 stars on Yelp, I had to give them a 3 star.  Here are the Pros & Cons of Burger Bar:  PROS 1.  We got seated immediately on a Wednesday night.  It was however, only 5:30pm and one other table that was dining at the time, 2.  The Bacon Mac & Cheese.  It truly was amazing here.  They were generous with the bacon in the Mac & Cheese.  That's what foodies what to see and taste.  They even humor you with another two full slices of bacon to top it off.  The mac & cheese was creamy without being watery and flavorful without being too salty.   3.  The burgers are huge.  The buns are a nice variation from your typical bun.  4.  I love that they have specials for the day.  I had the Guinness Short Rib burger.  You can taste the Guinness in it for sure!   5.  The hubs got the Wild Mushroom Burger.  The wild mushrooms were delicious and quite flavorful.   6.  The dressing on the side salad was light and just the right amount to allow you to taste the salad without drenching it.   CONS 1.  The burger meat tasted bland and fell a little flat after the first bite.  2.  The Guinness Short Ribs were definitely tasty during the first bite but then started reminding me of a glorified sloppy joe.  :(   3.  The fries were too salty and way overcooked.   4.  The waitress with the leopard apron was nice but really spent way too much time flirting with the chef rather than doing her job.  I saw someone's freshly made mac and cheese sitting on the delivery counter for a few minutes as she chatted away.    Disclaimer: I come from LA where gourmet burger joints are everywhere (Father's Office, Umami, FukuBurger, G Burger).  It's competitive and really hard to beat.  For Montreal, Burger Bar is a good alternative to your regular pub burger perhaps."}
{"text":"2/1/16 I am 60 yo, and have lived in NYC my whole life, so I've been to hundreds of hamburger places over the years. From Wetsons (for those of you old enough to remember), to Shakeshack, Smashburger, Five Guys, Sonic, etc. Today, I have NEVER experienced a burger as delicious as the Brie/Wildmushroom burger that i was served today. The staff couldnt have been nicer and the owner Maury, forget it. He sat next to us at the bar while we ate and couldnt have been friendlier or more accommodating. He even walked us out of the pub to help us find the Metro subway.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here because Yelp had it as 4 stars. They are wrong. 10 stars. We had the smoked meat poutine, the Québécois burger, and the Firehouse burger. Each was awesome.   The server, the hostess and bar staff was great and eager to please despite this being the busy Formula 1 weekend,   Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the foie gras burger and while I thought it was a good burger, it wasn't the best burger I ever had. With having a nice slice of foie on top of the beef patty there is no need for cheese or bacon, though the beef patty which was supposed to be medium was more well done and could use more seasoning and fat to give it more flavour which I thought was lacking. The side of coleslaw was really nice, the dressing is oil and vinegar based which is how I like it.  Service was excellent, the wait staff was very attentive and friendly. As eating my burger was a very messy affair, my waitress kept an ample stack of napkins on my table and promptly took away my used ones. I felt kind of bad for being such a messy slob so I ate the last half of my burger with a fork and knife. All of the wait staff had a great happy attitude and seemed like having a good time while doing their job which is always great to see. I also really like the music they played in the restaurant.   The draught selection was very good, and a good accompliment to any burger, though they do have daily mixed drink specials."}
{"text":"the place certainly has potential, i will give it that. I went on a Thursday night which seems to be a popular night of the week (my guess is happy hours?) anywho, we sat outside on the small patio that overlooked Crescent Street which was awesome aside from the fact that i had monstrous amounts of smoke billowing up my nose from the patrons down below (this is certainly not the restaurants fault but more of a little warning for people who want to sit outside)  Service is awful. Our waitress was not friendly AT ALL and made us wait a good 25 minutes before she asked us what we would like to order (when we told her we only needed a few). As we were very patiently waiting, I was watching her pick her wedgie, constantly check her facebook on her cell phone, and towel slapping the bartender. Not once did she check on any of us outside until i aggressively tapped on the glass to motion her outside.  Food was OK. It came out in good time however the burger and fries were cold. It was tasty ,as I ate the entire thing, but the fries were over salted and very mooshy.   Like i said earlier, the place definitely has great potential. im hoping i just caught them on a bad night but be forewarned yelpers."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant, j'y suis allée le jour du match de boxe (Mayweather - Pacquiao) j'ai pris un bon burger au bacon royale avec des barres de mars fris comme dessert avec une boisson, j'étais dans les 35$ sans pourboires. C'était bon et le service est rapide. On a pu rester le temps qu'on voulait pour regarder le match tranquillement même après avoir fini donc c'était cool :)  La serveuse super sympa, elle m'a bien conseillée et m'a fait rire !"}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by a few locals,  and were pleasantly surprised by the outcome. The atmosphere was amazing, clean, great music and very welcoming. Service was excellent, food came very quickly and the server was very nice. We would definitely recommend the milkshakes and poutine. Food was delicious and there wasn't one thing we would change."}
{"text":"Went to Burger Bar yesterday around lunch time. I first started with extra spicy wings which were so delicious. For my main course I had the \"captain nemo\". It was so tasty, however, it fell apart very quickly due to the amount of food between the buns. Food was 5/5 overall, but the beer could have been better. Their blonde beer tasted like budlight."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I CAME HERE FOR BURGERS AND I HAD SUCH A TASTY BURGER! A BISON SUPER CHEDDAR BURGER! It was my first time trying bison meat and it was a perfect experience. Their milkshakes are also the best that I've had in years!!!! The atmosphere there is adequate, really adequate for a burger place! The prices are reasonably fair. Juicy bison meat... mmmmmmmh... so goooood..."}
{"text":"There firestorm and Jack Daniels burgers are fantastic,a bit pricey but totally worth it. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had. They'll make any drink you want even if it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"A solid lunch choice on Crescent. It certainly isn't a fast lunch venue, but that is to be expected for the street.   The burgers themselves, are well cooked and seasoned. Great flavor, the fries solid. I have no real complaints to levy the food, but I also lack a glowing praise of it. It has a similar vibe to the other restaurants in Las Vegas and San Francisco which share the same name, and does them credit in its execution of the burgers.   If you're craving a large, juicy, tasty burger served with a pint of beer. (Something I often do at lunch!) This is a fantastic choice for that.   Also, the Poutine Burger is something to see, I still don't know how to attack that one without making a mess!"}
{"text":"We walked over a mile to get here and it was worth every single bite!!!! I had the veggie burger and my husband had their classic burger!!! Both were delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I knew this place would be good, but I'm pleased to say that the burgers here were even better than expected! I was blown away by the quality!   I went with my fiancé yesterday for a celebratory lunch. First impressions: small dining area, nice looking bar in front. Immediately greeted at the door and quickly seated. Not long after we had sat down, our waitress greeted us and asked us if we had any questions. A couple sitting next to us already had their food and were going on about how their burgers were the best burgers they've ever eaten (I have a feeling that a lot of people say this upon trying their first burger here, because not long after we had received our food, my fiancé was telling me the same and I agreed with him!).  The burger selection was quite hard to choose from (because they all looked so good), I ended up ordering the Yosemite Sam (with avocado, smoked bacon, homemade salsa, roasted red peppers and chipotle mayo)(17$), with a poutine on the side (+3,50$), and my fiancé chose the current Burger Week submission, an Angus burger with 10 yr old cheddar, boar bacon, crispy onions, lettuce and a really delicious sauce with a smoky flavour to it (can't remember the name of it for the life of me)(15$), with onion rings on the side (+3,50$). We also each ordered a pint, mine being a Dublin's pub cider (8$) and his being a Guinness (9$).  The burgers were HUGE! The beef patties were thick and full of flavour, with just a bit of pink in the middle (which is good, shame on restaurants that overcook their patties and ruin an otherwise good burger). My burger tasted mostly of bacon and salsa, with a mostly subtle flavour profile. Then I tried my fiancé's burger... OMG! It was really fantastic, between the gamey quality of the boar bacon, the smokiness of the sauce and the huge slice of aged cheddar, this burger really wowed the both of us. Other than the burgers, I found the gravy on my poutine to be one of the best I've had, which surprised me. It had a savoury quality to it, and was thick and dark. My fiancé ended up dipping his onion rings in the excess gravy, we both really loved it.  Besides the food, our waitress was extremely friendly and welcoming, and the establisment itself was pleasing. The decor was nice and the music (which consisted of a lot of classic rock) wasn't too loud. The limited amount of tables on the main floor (there was also a dining area with a seperate bar on the second floor, not in use during lunch, along with restrooms) made for a more intimate dining experience. All of this made for a really amazing lunch, we would definitely come here again for our next date night!"}
{"text":"I ordered the usual Baba Burger, first bite and a horrible blood taste in my mouth from the meat. I left the meat above my forke & knife after eating bun & decoration to show something is wrong, the waitress passed by removed my plate without noticing. When I told her she said i'm sorry, so much for Hospitality Management & Service. I adsjed for a Fried Mars Bar with vanilla icecream. Waitress got me a spoon, when i tried cutting into the BAR i almost killed my neighbor with a fried Mars shrapnnel; this plate definitely needs a forke & knife to eat it. We asked for the bill, desert is 1$ more expensive then on the Menu. And this is supposed to be the award winning best burger place in Montréal ?!?!?!?!  What about service????? Customer experience??? Well u ca$hed your bill and won't see me again, NEEEEXT..."}
{"text":"I had the boss burger and it was particularly good.  The quality of the meat and ingredients was evident from the first bite.  My friends were similarly enamoured with their burgers.  The space is narrow and casual and the service is prompt and fun.  Our waitress was amazing.  Great spot for an informal meal in the club district on Crescent Street"}
{"text":"Although I'd been here before, and enjoyed my meal, this is my first review. I came here for lunch with a couple of girls from work. We walked in and the place was pretty much empty, which we were happy about because we didn't want to be too long.   After being seated, we were given adequate time to look over the menu and make our decision. The waitress finally came over to get our orders; I went with the Jack Daniels BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. One of the previous times I had been, my boyfriend raved about the Jack Daniels burger, so I thought I'd give it a go.   When we got our food, I was excited to dive in because I had been craving a burger all day. The burger was pretty good, however there was a flavour I couldn't pinpoint that I could've done without. The patty was cooked very well and was nice and juicy. I didn't taste much of the BBQ sauce which was a let-down, because if you're going to call it a Jack Daniels BBQ burger, make sure to load on the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. The sweet potato fries were a tad dry, but they were served with a delicious spicy mayo that I couldn't get enough of. I piled it onto the fries and the burger.   The meal itself was decent; it hit the spot, but the burger did leave something to be desired in that it lacked said Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  As for the service, our waitress seemed to have an attitude problem; when we were ready to pay and get back to work, she brought over our bills and as soon as one of my companions put down a debit card (without knowing they do NOT take interac), she made a snotty remark that \"Oh we don't take debit here. That's why there's an ATM in the front\". I should've offered her a napkin for the attitude dripping from her lip. After she got money from the ATM, we had to wait around for an additional 5 minutes, standing around the table, with our coats on, waiting for her to come back. If any of you have ever been, you will know that on the first floor, all tables are visible from behind the bar. She easily saw us waiting, and waiting, and waiting, but neglected to come over. We eventually just went to her and then left. She unfortunately left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for Valentine and it was great ... I love the food here... the hamburgers are worthy because they are sooo good... also if you like spicy food I strongly recommend you the spicy chicken wings !!!"}
{"text":"This is a great find on a street that has plenty to draw your attention. The location has a such a great feel and our service was not only top notch, but personable. My biggest complaint would be that my stomach is not able to hold all the good stuff on this menu. I was drawn to so many tasty options that I was almost pulled away from ordering a burger, but I mean its literally in the name so how do you not get one right? Best call I made all night.   The Bacon and Mac Cheese was calling to me, but had to go with the Poutine. We opted for the Hangover Poutine, which is a tasty piece of work. The egg is next level, plus bacon...yep its amazing. My wife opted for the Jack Daniels Burger and I had to go with the Royale with Cheese. I read some reviews before we went in about how spot their cook was for the burgers and they did not disappoint. Both of our burgers: Spot. ON. Med Rare.   We got some solid recommendations on our beer from our server and she kept them coming. One of the better choices we made on our visit and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best burger, best fries, best onion rings, and best sangria I've had in a long time.  I could have eaten there every single day, but there were just too many restaurants to try on our first trip to Montréal.   Our waitress was so great. She made us feel comfortable and relaxed. It was like having a meal in the comfort of your own home. This is just comfort food to the max.  I can't wait to go back to Montréal just to go back to the Burger Bar."}
{"text":"Had great service with a great meal. The burgers were good but the sides were better. Bacon Mac&Cheese and Pulled Pork Poutine were fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were quickly seated out on the patio, and a cute little table with a good view of Crescent Street. Service was quick to get water and drinks out to the table.  Ordered two burgers, substituted chicken for the 6 ounce patty. Mine was the super hot one with a jalapeño relish, my wife's was chicken with pepper jack cheese and avocado. Both were delicious. Could've used a larger amount of chicken though, considering you pay 3$ upcharge.   Overall an excellent dinner experience, with the interesting sights and sounds of the sidewalk."}
{"text":"With so many places to eat on Crescent St. I am sure that millions of people have walked right past this place without ever wondering the awesomeness of treasures that their menu can bestow upon them.  Ok this place isn't really a secret anymore especially since they have been honored with the title of best burger in town.   I stumbled (literally) on this place on rainy Sunday night.  Being a rainy Sunday night, there wasn't really anyone in the place so service was very prompt and attentive.   Like a true tourist I opted for the \"Poutine Burger\"   Just in case you can't tell by the name, they take a burger and put poutine in it.. 2 awesome things and putting them together is ballsy. What I don't understand is how they got the poutine fries to stay together without collapsing. You need to harness your jenga skills or have a retractable jaw to eat this! Any way you decide to eat it, rest assured that it rest assured that it will be nom nom..   The fries, gravy and curds were all great quality and somehow managed to stay solid and tasty however the champ of the meal was the burger patty. I'm not too sure what you guys feed the cows up in Canada but man the burger tasted great!. While I was eating, the head chef came to bar to chat. He explained on where the meat came from and how long and arduous the process was. He took extreme pride in the ingredient selection and it showed. The staff also was very helpful in suggesting other \"must eats\" around the city.    All and all the meal and experience was enjoyable. Eat here with confidence."}
{"text":"This place is a lively restaurant on the busy Crescent Street. There are lots of choices around here, but this is worth your time. We were hungry for burgers and although I almost got distracted by some other items on their menu like their French onion soup, I held to it and shared the hangover burger with my dinner mate. Of course it is insanely huge, but it actually was really tasty.  Poutine, bacon, a fresh bun, and beef... why not? We had it with a crisp Caesar salad. I did not catch our servers name but she was friendly and quick with bringing out our food.  It did get loud in the restaurant, but it was not obnoxious.  Although the hangover was a bit of a novelty, I would go back for more."}
{"text":"Burger Bar was one of the first places that caught our eye during our first full day exploring Montreal. It was a sunny, mild day outside, perfect for eating on the second floor balcony overlooking the activity down below. I had the famous hangover burger along with the wings and was beyond stuffed by the time I finished my burger. The poutine burger was nearly impossible to eat, but everything inside - the mini poutine, the egg, smoked bacon - was cooked perfectly according to both, my friend and I.   The terrace on the second floor was very cramped and our wings did inexplicably arrive towards the end of the meal, but that's only a minor inconvenience on an otherwise beautiful day with a great meal."}
{"text":"The servers are really nice, and the food is great! Very accommodating and definitely try the hangover poutine!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic ambiance, way more classy than you would expect from a burger joint. It has a great bar with a good selection of cocktails and drinks. The selection and quality of burgers is amazing! They are so creative with their toppings/fillings, ranging from classic comfort goodies all the way to high-end gormet ingredients. The poutine could be the gravy though (pun intended), the flavours and consistency are perfect to me. I'm thoroughly impressed and will come back here every time I'm visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"A la recherche d'une place ou manger qui est compatible avec le régime keto (pas de pain, pâte, céréales?, légume sous terre, patate, sucre...), j'ai découvert ce restaurant.   Beaucoup de choix de hamburger (duh) mais surtout, sur le menu bison, hamburger santé où le pain est remplacé par de la laitue. Parfait! On demande, cette option est possible sans frais pour tous les burger! Pour les frites ? Une salade césar sans croûton avec du bon bacon frais.   Donc nous avons pris le burger Yosemite Sam sur lit de laitue avec salade césar. C'est un burger avec mayonnaise forte, avocat, bacon, buf, tomate genre bruschetta pas vraiment glucides et j'ai oublié la suite.   C'était excellent!   Le service à été très rapide, la serveuse hyper courtoise, gentille et efficace. Ce restaurant est maintenant dans mes favoris"}
{"text":"The Samurai II burger (salmon crusted with sesame & almond, Wakame salad, tomato, red onion, and wasabi mayo) was delicious.  She asked and I agreed to the salmon medium -- it came unevenly cooked and the thicker middle was very rare.   I'd advise asking for medium well if you are skittish.    The other party had the Jack Daniels BBQ burger and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Fries were delicious and perfectly cooked.  Mayo (of course) on the side.    The onion rings as an add on were well worth the additional charge -- some of the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant pour manger burger et Poutine surtout le burger foie gras et champignons sauvages et la Poutine osso bucco (Poutine week 2015)"}
{"text":"Chicken wing overcooked,burgers are heavy but very tasty and innovative, service was food, overall like this place"}
