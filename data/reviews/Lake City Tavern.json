{"text":"Historical establishment made NEW.  Classic old school bar completely upgraded, but note Lake City Tavern stands out from the crowd in that the food on their limited menu is Top Notch!  Whether it's their delicious gourmet Build Your Own Burger, boneless wings, or Elvis with Bacon, LCT does it right!  If you want some \"Bar\" food made as good as it can be, then go to Lake City Tavern and be pleasantly surprised!  This is our 4rth time there in 4 months!"}
{"text":"Cold beer and great burgers. What more could you ask for?  Excellent service?  Yeah, that too!  Highly recommend Lake City Tavern."}
{"text":"Great spot, if you haven't you should get the wings with your beer plus they have Keno"}
{"text":"Lake City Tavern is an awesome bar with great drinks, delicious food and a fun atmosphere!   They have live music almost every night of the week and on top of that drink specials! I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area. It's close to the airport which is convenient. I will be back soon for sure! :)"}
