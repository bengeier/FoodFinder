{"text":"Sushi is tasty but overpriced compared to other local places. \"Half price\" is now cash only, 40% off and only from 10-12 on Friday and Saturday nights. Very disappointing and we would visit more often if the discounted sushi option was available like it used to be."}
{"text":"I was looking for real sushi in the area and they have hibachi and cold sushi with a great selection of rolls! The spicy shrimp tempura roll was delicious :)  At the hibachi side the cooking is amazing and the staff puts up a nice show with the flames and the egg breaking as well as balancing the food. We were served by a super polite and very nice Japanese waitress. The place was a very nice surprise."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the pricing was over the roof!! They charge way to much money for that kind of food.. They are horrible actors, they act like they care about their customer, but in reality they only care about the money..  I'm won't be going back. I hope I helped somebody before they made a mistake by trying this place out."}
{"text":"The sushi festival was delish and fun. There's something about the presentation that made me excited to eat it. Try the tempura-style fried cheesecake. It's weird but tastes good :)"}
{"text":"Great night (1/10 )with my family on my 76th brithday. Larry was a great grillmaster and all the food was tasty and cooked properly. Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Very Good Great Service!\"!\" Enjoyed food very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Love the Sushi rolls they have! and the food is so good!! It is fun and upbeat, will always bring a smile to your face."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place??   This was my first experience of having sushi a few years ago and it was top of the line! Great atmosphere, great service and amazing sushi! Saturday after 10p is half-off sushi night with a drink purchase. It has been a year since I've attended a Saturday night here and a year ago, it was okay to reorder as many times as you wanted and you could pay with plastic. Last night, it was totally different.   I was with a group of six. When we walked in, no one was up front to seat us. When we did sit, our waitress Cindy was miserable and rude to us! She told in a rude way that we could only order once. The sushi was okay but not the amazing stuff it used to be. Cindy rarely checked on us and continued to be a miserable witch while we were there. Oh, and while retrieving a refill, she stuck her finger in my friend's glass! When we got ready to pay our tab, she advised us that it was cash only! That information should have been told to us before we ordered! A friend had to drive somewhere to find an atm. It was the worst experience and I don't plan on going back for a very long time if ever!"}
{"text":"Our chef was great and they were knowledgeable about gluten free! However our sushi and dinner at the Teppan-Yaki table was just OK."}
{"text":"I usually order take-out from Fujiyama because I can't get enough of their Green Hat roll. Anyone who is a fan of the philly roll will absolutely love the Green Hat roll, which is basically a larger, deep-fried version of the philly roll (salmon and cream cheese) with crab and tuna - topped off with delicious semi-spicy wasabi mayo and fish roe. Every person that I've introduced this particular sushi roll to has become addicted to it as well!   When I dine in, the service is usually decent.  The atmosphere is dim and intimate in the dining area.  The hibachi section is usually more lively and great for large groups and families.  My family is a huge fan of the Fujiyama fried rice. It is pricey and tastes best with Yum Yum sauce (given upon request) in my opinion.   The only issues I have with Fujiyama is that the area where there used to a turtle tank looks like a construction disaster, the hostess is rarely at the front desk, and sometimes my take-out order isn't correct. The restaurant has gone under many renovations and looks very nice and clean overall, however."}
{"text":"Service was very rude from the server and chef, food was stale and we waited 20 min to get a refill for drinks. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"To be honest, I haven't been to Fujiyama any other time than Fridays or Saturdays from 10pm-midnight. But since I've discovered the place 2-3 years ago, I've been back about 35 times.  It can get crowded those nights and if you want fast service, I would not recommend going on a busy Friday night. The sushi is made by hand and if you sit in the main dining room you can watch it being made. (So the busier it is, the longer it takes).  The sushi itself is fresh and excellent quality. I'd recommend trying the shrimp tempura and the spicy craw-fish.  There have been some terrible servers over the years, but the last time I was there (Friday 10/14), the servers I saw in the hibachi room (normally you wouldn't sit there for half-price unless it's super crowded like it was) were awesome.  There are a few quirks to half price sushi: you have to order a drink and it's cash only (if you pay by credit, they'll charge full-price). Also, there are some rolls that are not half price, but the server will usually let you know. Overall, it's a great place to spend Friday/Saturday night with a few friends."}
{"text":"My parents live near Fujiyama so I've had their sushi a few times.  It's always been good- eat in or take out.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Had my first Sushi experience there and was pleasantly surprised. Prices are a bit high so I don't order much but the flavors are nice. Service is quick and it's never super busy when I go. I would tell my friends to go there. Wish I was there right now. :)"}
{"text":"Was around the area and figured I'd check it this place out due to high rating. The service was alright but the food was terrible. I didn't sit at the hibachi table, but did order hibachi at the dining area. The sushi (Alaska roll) was warm to start with, the soup was just broth which smelled like a wet dog, the vegetable portion was pathetic, and the scallops were obviously frozen and tasted way too \"fishy\" to be fresh. I wouldn't complain if it wasn't 19$/plate but considering the cost vs quality, I will not be back."}
{"text":"this is one of the better Hibachi/Sushi places in town. I was actually really empressed. The sushi was very good, nicely sliced, well presented and very fresh! the hibachi was great, the chef really went above and beyond to make sure we all had a great time. the scallops I had were big and juicy. My steak was of pretty good quality. this is def my new local spot, I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great place for 1/2 price sushi on Friday and Saturday nights (starting at 10pm, kinda late, I know). Be warned you must order a beverage and you must have CASH - hit the ATM before you get there please!    If anyone remembers Asuka of Westlake (it was my favorite, & it and their amazing Victoria's Secret roll still hold a special place in my heart) - that being said, Fujiyama is a great replacement for my 'night out with the girls sushi experience.'  However, this place can get PACKED. And it's not the crowd everyone may be able to tolerate so easily - I've been here plenty a Friday night and it seems the entire high school football stadium empited out into Fujiyama. Not a fan, but luckily that's not every time.  As far as the sushi goes, it's good - I stick with my usuals: spicy tuna, the chop chop (crab, tempura flake, lettuce), crazy roll (its a california roll with some kind of crab salad on the top), and a shrimp tempura roll. The green salad is divine, I really love their ginger dressing.  The waitstaff has always been friendly to us - and I think as long as you're not loud, obnoxious, or overly needy (which should go without saying) you'll get great service!"}
{"text":"Went for %40 off sushi on the weekend. We tried the interesting sushi rolls, it wasn't that great. Tempura was excellent, traditional sushi though was mediocre."}
{"text":"I've dined here before and had awesome experiences, well I dined in tonight in the sushi area and had a not so great time. After ordering one side of chicken, one side of steak, one side of rice and one side of noodles. We soon realized our waitress didn't didn't understand what we wanted when we received soup and salad... I began telling her we didn't order it and she sort of just walked away. Next she arrived with two sides of rice and noodles when we had only ordered one. I said to her we only wanted one side. She put them down and said no you ordered them. Next she arrived with what was supposed to be just a side of chicken and steak which turned out to be chicken steak and veggies. We realized that she took our order as a combination which is the complete opposite of what we wanted. We did not want soup, salad, extra rice or veggies, which is why we didn't even touch it. Very surprised with the over all outcome. This wasn't even about spending less by ordering their side dish options rather that we didn't need or want all of the extras that came at an additional charge."}
{"text":"We took our daughters for their birthday. There were 6 in our party. We had the hibachi experience. All in all the food was good as was our \"experience\". The problem starts soon after we left. Two in our party, one of my daughters and myself, got food poisoning. Seeing as how we don't live together and haven't see each other in a few days, our only thing in common was dinner. While the rest of the party was fine, we can find no other link. It's sad because this place was better in every way than a hibachi place we previously visited that was closer to home, except for that one thing."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Sake selection was a hit with my friends who drink it as well and was available hot or cold. I loved the tuna tataki which I now look for wherever I go!"}
{"text":"Dinner out with the kids and a couple of their friends and they wanted Japanese at Fujiyama.  This would not be my first choice, but the kids enjoy the hibachi style dining experience.  The overall atmosphere is not inviting at all, no bonus points for decor.  This place was almost empty on a Friday night at 7pm.  The food quality was good and hibachi chef was entertaining along with good service."}
{"text":"They should close. Attitude problems, never ready for customers and they bring you your order and then forget about you. They're so put out by doing a shoddy job of doing their jobs that I'll never be back. I'd rather just drive one exit further and go to Crocker Park. MUCH better sushi and MUCH better atmosphere. Go to Veing's instead."}
{"text":"Great Avon Japanese restaurant.  Food is good, service is good and hibachi is very entertaining."}
{"text":"I was a steady patron every Friday night for over two years.  I used to constantly bring people with me and I always tipped very well.  The trick with the half-priced sushi special was that it didn't start until a certain hour, so it was extremely important to get there on time and get your order in or else you would be waiting a very very long time to get your food.  The tempura is great and there were several special rolls I really enjoyed.  The tempura banana desert is excellent as well.  But after awhile, I started noticing that I was having stomach problems the next day.  Around the same time, we started noticing the fish was sometimes not so fresh.  The situation continued to decline until the last time I went, I ordered some sashimi and it came out smelling funny.  I told the waitress and asked to have the sashimi replaced.  However they chose not to and that was the end of my patronage."}
{"text":"So here's the straight scoop: this place is a bit more expensive than other hibachi spots I've been to HOWEVER, what I paid for in cash, I saved in stomach agony.   That's right kids, Fujiyama didn't make me sick. At all. I don't know if they use fresher ingredients, less oil, or it was just chef Andy's skill on the grill but I left feeling adequately satiated and without a stomach curdling ache.  If you're in the area, make Fujiyama your spot. There's even a very Instagrammable wall on the way back to the main dining area."}
{"text":"Best sushi. Waitress horrible. She can't Pick up her feet when she walks. No personality. I would much rather have one of the male servers. At least they have personality !!"}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in for dinner. Had chicken steak and scallops. Everything was cooked to perfection in the fried rice is really good. The chef was fun and we enjoyed the show."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times now and have had great service along with great food. Hibachi side was very good and filling. I was pleasantly surprised that the steak and lobster had a great taste. Even more surprising was the sushi. Great selection and flavors. Can't go wrong there. The order of fried rice is huge. Enough for two and take some home. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best dining experience ever! First of all our waiter was cool, set up our sake bombs for us! Then the chef was off the chain, cool as hell! He flung egg in our mouths and squirted sake at us, sooooo cool! Worth every penny!!!! 10 stars!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Fujiama many, many times. We are Avon locals and it is the only local hibachi restaurant around. It is always sub par food but usually great service. We have enjoyed  going there as a family with the kids. Tonight our service was HORRENDOUS. Our server walked up in a horrible mood and did not smile once throughout the dinner. When one of our party complained about the toughness of his filet she responded \" I don't know, I don't cook the food\".  She ignored half of our dessert order and the kids were heartbroken. I asked to speak with the manager and the man behind the bar told me he was the owner. I explained our evening to him and he said \" what do you want me to do about it\". Needless to say we will not be returning and I strongly suggest you do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I went to this location to a friend's going away party and had the teppanyaki. The chef was funny and very entertaining this is definitely a great thing for family and friends. The food was also delicious and not too salty. The food is fairly priced and totally worth it because you get a show as it is being prepared."}
{"text":"I enjoy their Hibachi entrees. The quantity of food is good. I think they may have cut the quantity from the past as I used to always have a take home box but the last few times I finished it all. The chefs are pretty skilled (some more entertaining than others). Love the miso soup. Their ginger dressing is okay but wish it was more of a creamy ginger dressing (more of a ranch consistency) than the chopped ginger paste like dressing.  Their sushi is pretty decent as well. I think it is one of the better ones in my area. My favorite happens to be to far so I come here if I don't feel like driving to the Beachwood area as I am a westsider."}
{"text":"Literally the worst customer service everrrrrr!! They are rude and make up their own fake rules after you're done with your meal theyll charge you extra. I have been going for years to their 50% sushi oh wait their 40% sushi bc they changed it. Which is only cash bc they make so much tax free money. Then when u share ur food with ur friend they charge u extra bc ur sushi can't be shared. Their drinks are flat as our bitchy waitresses chest!  Their tables are always sticky! Their water taste like it has soap in it!  Their waitresses are rude as f, they need to go back to waiter school!  Make sure u have cash or ur paying extra, make sure u don't share your food, make sure u understand Japanese, make sure u like the taste of nasty water, make sure u like flat ass soda."}
{"text":"i like fujiyama, but sometimes i feel like, how can you mess up hibachi? i do like to dine in the sushi dining room and experience that side of things as well. i feel that the servers are not the friendliest, especially when dining in for their 1/2 price sushi nights, which I think I heard are not 1/2 price anymore. if you are craving sushi and you are in the area, not a bad choice.  i just do not think it's up high on my list of places to frequent."}
{"text":"Years ago I loved this place, excellent food, nice bar that could hold its own. However, last time I went in for a hibachi. Since I was dining alone I was seated in a regular dining room. When my entrée came out it looked like the chef just scraped leftovers on my plate. Not appetizing by looks or taste. I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't $30, but for this meal I would have been better off at the Chinese place next door. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Service was nothing special. Chef was awesome. Prices were way overpriced for a lunch menu. Better to go for dinner than lunch"}
{"text":"Owner -John may bring the customers in but no one trained him on customer service ! So therefor his staff follows the same suit. Let's argue because you received 2 TBS of vegetables ??? Are u that cheap u can't serve extra or your portions are not correct for each customer ? Let's make u wait for your check after the table leaves because u now are cooking what u call extra vegetables too make the customer happy. Oh boy .... Time to find a new Hibachi restaurant , after all the years eating there , this one gets a thumbs down and loses a customer today."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for dinner and she had been there multiple times this would be my first time and Fort be my first time I was not impressed I did not enjoy the food when we were sat at our table the silverware was dirty the plate had some type of food on it the food was just overpriced the food was just blah. I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the experience has been very inconsistent. At its best it was ok and at its worst - it was the worst hibachi experience I've had. On our most recent trip, the restaurant was mostly empty, the seafood was stale and rubbery, the stir fried rice was bland at watered down and they brought out our appetizer after the meat was served. Definitely not worth $145 and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"My brother used to like the 1/2 price sushi. We experienced a decline in quality firsthand--mostly through 2011. Even when the food was still good, the service sucked unless we got a particular server. They removed stuff from the special and dropped the quality until it just wasn't worth the drive for us. My brother, being the trooper he is, stuck with it until they served him sushi that he just couldn't eat--bad fish. He let them know and they did nothing. Save your money for a place that uses quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This place for hybatchi is amazing. We had a table of 14 ppl. And our cook was absolutely halierious. I've never laughed so much in my life. He had the whole table going. I wish I remeber his name bc I would request him each time. The food as always is delicious and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"It was my first time at a hibachi grill and we stopped on our road trip to have dinner with the in-laws! Came here upon the insistence of my brother in law. Upon walking in, it looks like you might have walked into a closed down restaurant. Very barren and just lacking any color or decorations. We sat and our expectations were pretty low. You tell your server what you want to order...type of meat, how much, etc. He did a horrible job explaining how it works. I think we ended up paying entirely too much because we finally just ordered something. Our \"mushroom\" soup came out...not sure what it was but it looked gross. I don't think one person touched theirs. Then our salads. It was literally, 5 pieces of wilted iceberg lettuce with the standard ginger dressing.   Our cook showed up and he is the only saving grace for this review! He was phenomenal. Hilarious, talented, and very entertaining. Every other table wanted him to be theirs! The food though...not very good. And by not very good, I mean terrible. Lack flavor, needed salt or the dipping sauce that they gave you. We didn't order dessert since we were so over the place by that point.   Meh."}
{"text":"What a time we had. Opened up with soup and salad. Ordered sushi off the Ala Carte menu.  Cold sake for her and hot sake for me. Split the veggie plate and the salmon steak and scallops trio. Our friends loved the house cocktail pictured below. We finished our evening with Sake Bombs (might be the most cost effective drink they offer if you like sake, Sake Bombs for 2 is $10).   The main course was Crazy Larry. He effortlessly flung the food around the flat top cooking it to perfection while providing creative and unique entertainment. I've seen my share of hibachi chefs and he takes the cake. He is an assassin with the shrimp and veggie flings. He has the hottest sliding volcano and his sake bottle knows no rest.  Just cannot get enough."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night about 6pm.  The place was about half full which was fine by us.  We sat in the candlelit sushi room with wood floors, wood booths, wood table and wood sushi bar.   Good comfortable atmosphere.  We shared the Ninja chicken and steak Hibachi, California roll, and Philadelphia Roll.  The sushi, soup, and salad came out within 5 minutes and the hibachi was serve on a plate about 10 minutes later.  The sushi was great and  well priced. The hibachi was good but way over priced considering it was just served up on a plated.  If the hibachi was a little less pricey, we'd give it a  4!"}
{"text":"We go to Fujiyama for their weekend sushi deals. 40% off Fri-Sun starting at 9:30pm.  Rolls are very good. Sushi chefs on staff do a great job preparing quality plates with a delicious flavor and pleasing aesthetic. Display is top notch! Service is very professional but a bit overstretched during the late night rush. Drinks and refills take a while. Unfortunately, quality can't be rushed and, if you don't show up at the start, you will be waiting a long time for your rolls. Be sure you're not in a hurry, have a couple drinks and bring good company."}
{"text":"I never heard of a \"side tip.\" I gave the Hibachi chef $10.00 cash then put the rest of my 20% tip on my credit card with the bill. The waitress had the nerve to come back and embarrass me in front of all the guests to explain  my tip. Then she yelled at me stating that she had to pay the chef $8.00 out of her pocket. I said, \"I already gave him $10.00. She told me  that's a \"side tip.\" I spent $100.00 total  for 2 people and my wife didn't even drink. Here's a tip: avoid this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for half off sushi for years. It's been a while since our last visit but we went last night...much to our dismay. First of all, just in case you don't already have to jump through hoops (cash only, order a drink, after 10pm, only order once etc) it's only 40% off now! Seriously? Is that 10% really gonna break the bank for you? I mean being cash only you have to be careful how much you spend and now it's that much more difficult. Unfortunately, that's not even the worst of it. Both my husband and I were terribly sick for hours in the middle of the night. After getting like 3 hours of sleep because I was up sick the rest of the night I'm lying in bed the next morning writing this, praying my still queezy stomach doesn't get worse again because my best friends baby shower is later today.  What a disappointing crash and burn : ("}
{"text":"First time experience, hands down the best sushi. 1/2 price Friday and Saturday nights at 10! Great sushi. Only thing I do NOT recommend is the Miso soup. It smelled rank! Be sure to have cash for half price deals!"}
{"text":"Oh Fujiyama...it seems like you were one of the first restaurants in this area, period. Certainly one of the first, if not only, good hibachi/sushi establishments in this neighborhood still. This place is huge. More than capable of handling a large group for some hibachi action or get all cultured up in the sushi room. The service staff is extremely pleasant and the cooks are known to serve up a delicious meal. Get here at fun time for the Friday night deal. 40% of sushi. BOOM! A few rules though - Fridays from 10 to 12 pm, cash only and drinks other than water must be ordered. A few of the baller rolls like unagi are exempt from the deal, but otherwise, get your sushi on!"}
{"text":"Came with a big group for hibachi.  Service was OK.  Chef was fun.  But the food was awful...bland and overcooked.  Definitely many better choices nearby."}
{"text":"I've been there with the family a dozen times.  Experiences with service has been average to good. We continue to go because the food is much more consistent than with other hibachi restaurants.  I can deal with the occasional rude high school kid filling my water as long as the food is delicious and the chef is entertaining. One of my three kids has recently taken to eating sushi....and the quality of everything I've sample from her plate is quickly converting me as well!"}
{"text":"I'm torn.    On one hand, as an evolved human being, sensitive to racial and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes, I have a hard time with the obviously fake, exaggerated pidgeon English used as a point of humor by the hibachi chefs.  On the other hand, hibachi is a hoot.  The chefs are entertaining and amazingly talented and the food is good.  Mon cher chou and I took HRM Bonita the Great for her first hibachi experience.  Since there were only three of us, they seated us with another family-- who turned out to be really nice and cool.  Their little girls were celebrating their 6th birthdays.  Luckily the chef appreciated the fact that he had a bunch of little kids at the table, so he toned down the racy language.  I did catch an earful from a chef at a table of adults-- oh my!!!  One chef was absolutly filthy!!  (hee hee)  The show was the usual volcano onion, flaming sake grill, food catch, sake chug, egg spin and fancy knifework.  All the little girls at the table were all giggling uncontrollably.  The chef was very nice and very silly.  I had the ninja combo of steak and scallops.  HRM had the chicken and Mon cher chou had the shrimp and chicken.  It was all very juicy and nicely prepared.  The veggies were perfectly crisp-tender.  Mon cher chou and I shared a bottle of surprisingly good American sake.  In addition you get a small salad, bowl of miso soup and shrimp appetizer.  It was all very reasonably priced for the amount and quality of the food as well as the show.  There is a very elegant sushi bar with Japanese entrees available.  I'll have to give that a go.  So should I feel guilty about having such a good time there?  Or should I just shut up and eat my shrimp?"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. There was a massive spider in my silverware napkin and when I showed it to the manager he just laughed. They didn't apologize or offer to do anything, all he said was \"well what do you want me to do\". I told them they should cover my bill which they agreed to do. However, they only took off the one meal when they brought the check. I asked to speak with the owner and a guy who said his name was Joe came over (who clearly was NOT the owner). He refused to cover our bill and was very hostile in speaking to me as a customer. I will never return here and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"I should have reviewed this place last time I was there, but truly... every experience has been a good one. Their sushi is fresh, beautiful and flavorful. Never any cold clumpy rice or soft fish. Even when you go for late night (10 pm- midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, they offer 40% off most sushi rolls!) it's delicious. Prices are fair, decor is nice and it's always clean. Service is friendly and they have a pretty good drink selection. A definite favorite stop on the far west side! I have never tried their hibachi"}
{"text":"Probably best sushi around. Great flavor, fast service and never over crowded. Only reason didn't get 5 stars is the obnoxious music playing.  They really need to find music that is suitable for any age group."}
