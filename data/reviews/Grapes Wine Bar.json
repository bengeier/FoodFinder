{"text":"I have wanting to try grapes for the longest time and for some reason I had put it off until now. What a fantastic place. Now, I'm typically a go for the heavy protein type dishes kind of guy. After trying their flat breads with the perfect blend of toppings such as the pear and gagonzola, oh my goodness, to die for. Just a great place for a date or to hang with friends. The wait staff was polite and attentive. The wine selection is vast and priced to accomodate most wallets and palets. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a laid back atmosphere with a mature and respectful crowd.  You dont have to be a wine snob to enjoy this great local spot, the wait staff is helpful and willing to make recommendations.  Grapes is now on my short list of local go to places."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a great atmosphere! Not only do they have a great selection, they have a great, knowledgeable staff! I've never been disappointed in any aspect when I visit and that's typically monthly! I try to attend their tastings where they specialize on regions or specific topics. The owners truly care about your experience and they go out of their way to ensure your expectations are met! The journey to discovering great wine and pairings is complex and can be intimidating, but the staff/owners and guest sommeliers take away any insecurities as I venture to discover  my favorite wine!"}
{"text":"Love the owners - this is simply a great place to hang out!  All the things the others have said are true, plus--on top of all those great features--you can find many bottles of wine for under $20, so if you're on a budget you can still enjoy yourself. And no uncorking fee! Their flatbread pizza, the Rustica, is my favorite lite supper!"}
{"text":"This is a definite favorite of my husband and I. We would love to come to the wine tastings and usually bring a group of friends with us. The owner and staff are so knowledgeable about wines and the service is fantastic!  We love great wines with a great atmosphere and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I am so glad we stopped to eat and enjoy a bottle of wine here!!! The food was great. We ordered the Flatbread and they were the best I have ever had. We started with the hummus which was delicious with some warm pita bread. There wine price was great!!! We will continue to come here often. This will be become our new favorite wine bar. And it's close to home."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night and easily found a seat on the sofa. The bar and multiple tables were open as well, which was surprising to me. We shared a bottle of wine- which was very well priced and served promptly, along with a charcuterie board and a flat bread. I wouldn't order the flat bread again, as it was very small, although it had great flavor. Our service was prompt. The server was knowledgable and attentive. We never felt rushed and enjoyed ourselves for well over an hour! We will definitely be returning and bringing friends along."}
{"text":"This place is great for a date, girls night out, after dinner drink, or anything, really. It is sleek, clean and cozy. My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday night. The place was pretty slow, but that's probably to be expected on a weeknight in the suburbs. The bartender was super friendly, welcoming and attentive. The wine list had plenty of options, and most of the by-the-glass options were reasonably priced ($8-12 per glass). The only suggestion I have is to serve the red wines below room temperature; our by-the-glass wine was a little too warm."}
{"text":"First time on A Saturday night it wasn't too crowded I would definitely come back in the fall and enjoy the patio. I had a bottle of white zin and some bruschetta ( who doesn't like it) it was great. The atmosphere was relaxing. Got to watch the Olympics and hear some good music."}
{"text":"Grapes Wine Bar in Matthews has become our comfy spot to try new wines and meet new friends.  The owners, Fabien and Lana, are so warm and welcoming.  The atmosphere is relaxed with soft sophistication.  I am comfortable going by myself if I want to do a little work from my laptop. Love love it!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to have  a couple of glasses  of wine because  the selections are varied and each one tasted great. We had Flatbread and was very good. I love the place very relaxing and the owner really knows wine. Looking forward to the wine tasting event."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I've ever given 5 stars but this place absofreakinlutly deserves it! Staff is tentative, order by the bar and sit where u fit in, and the cheese platter made me contemplate having a food affair on my husband. Came in for a drink and fell in love with the place do yourself the favor when in town and have a drink... You will not be disappointed and I'm very hard to please.  Next time I'll order a flatbread the only reason I didn't was because the cheese platter was big and I didn't want to seem like a fatty lol but if I didn't think I'd be judged I'd indulge (serious)"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Grapes Wine Bar! You can sit quietly with a glass of wine and read your Kindle while the live music plays Friday and Saturday nights, stop in for Dessert with friends, have a wine tasting with the amazing home made hummus, olive or cheese plate. They have it all and are so genuinely gracious, not to mention its close to home so no need to fight traffic or look for parking. I absolutely recommend the following wine (love Merlot!) if you are going to have any of their dark chocolate cake/desserts: Villa San Juliette, Paso Robles, CA They recommended it and wow did the fruit in the wine PoP! Great choice!"}
{"text":"Heading to Grapes Wine Bar tonight and I know it will not disappoint because it never does.  The wine selection is fantastic and the food and service great.  The owners are really nice people and truly appreciate your business. If you aren't sure what to order, just ask for a recommendation.   It is a favorite destination for my girlfriends and I.  If you love wine and haven't tried it, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing change in Matthews. Great atmosphere, great wine selection, casual, and comfortable.  The owner took quite a bit of time to suggest wines, share upcoming events and to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Grapes a few times now, but I've never yelped about it! It's a great spot to stop in after dinner for wine and/or dessert or meet friends after work. Last time the weather was perfect so we got to sit out on the patio and enjoy a bottle of Rose and a meat/cheese plate. Yummm!   They have a great selection of wines by the bottle as well as by the glass. For food, they have sammies, salads and appetizers.   If you can disconnect from the fact you're between a Qdoba and Jimmy Johns and just listen to the live music and the huge fountain in the shopping center, it's a great spot (and it's close to home)!"}
{"text":"This is such a great wine bar! A large indoor area with lots of table seating as well as two large couch areas. Also a large outdoor patio!! The owner is so great, and they hold lots of wine events.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"There are not many places that I know of in this area quite like Grapes Wine Bar. When I lived in Matthews it was my go-to when I was frustrated at the office. If you go there before 4pm it's actually quiet and a lovely place to work either on the couch or at the standard tables near the bar.   The staff is very helpful and they do a great job of checking your progress without coming over too often. I've never had anything there I didn't enjoy, and some of the food and wine pairings are quite clever and tasty. I also like that most of them are not too heavy, so it's a great place for apps to tide you over until a late dinner. At night, it's intimate enough to go on a date or out with friends and still hear the conversation. I haven't attended any of the special events / tastings, but I've heard those are quite lovely as well."}
{"text":"This is a lovely spot in Sycamore Commons - on the outside, you have a table (tables?), where on a nice afternoon you can sit and watch the fountain if it is flowing, or simply watch people in the other shops. On the inside, you have a well-appointed interior, with bottles of wine all around, in a somewhat darkened room. It is actually quite nice. Even the menu sounds reasonable, but then most do.  Unfortunately the best choice at that point is probably to leave, because that is about as good as it gets. The service is really not great. Asking for advice results in getting not much more than a blank stare, so you are on your own. Nothing wrong with that, as we are grown ups (well, most of the time). Soldiering on, we chose a charcuterie-style meat and cheese offering, because meat and cheese.  For $15, you get a smattering of both, on a small plate, with a couple tiny pieces of bread. Presentation is not brought into the equation. You could do this in your kitchen, and with even a moment's thought, you could do a whole lot better (for a much better price, of course). Not a great choice, and as there wasn't much direction, perhaps it would have been best to start with some of that wine..."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to wind down and relax from a long day. The owner and staff have always been pleasant and accommodating. The waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu. The wine is fabulous. I recommend the white wines, since those are my favorite. They are always so crisp and refreshing.   The food has always been fantastic, the chicken salad wrap is delicious. All of their foods the times I have been there have always been delightful and fresh. Would recommend venturing out to this lovely place."}
{"text":"We have been talking about going here for a couple years and finally went. The atmosphere was very welcoming and pleasant. Unfortunately, it was raining and we couldn't sit on the patio. The wine selection for us white wine drinkers was broad. The Lunatic White Blend satisfied this usual Riesling drinker and my wife had a delicious German Riesling. To complement the wine we had a nice antipasto plate. We will be making ourselves regulars here. Especially when we move within walking distance."}
{"text":"This place is great! They had good music tonight. Service is solid. Wine selection is pretty good. Plates ar very good. Really nice atmosphere. ( and their inspection score is 100!"}
{"text":"I'm on a 3-star rant today!  :) I just had to update my review which I hate to do but I had such a horrid experience the last 2 times we were here that I need to balance out my prior review.    Are they under new management?  New chef?  New owner altogether?  Something has shifted in the atmosphere and it is obvious.  The employees are not as knowledgeable about wine as they once were and the food seems to be lacking in quality slightly.  Although, I do still LOVE their flatbreads.   The young waitress that was serving us last week, literally couldn't recommend a good glass of wine.  She ended up suggesting their house wine.  She just didn't know anything about it and said we should ask the other waiter because he is the \"wine guy.\"  That's great and I'm happy for him but he isn't my waiter and why do you work here...a wine bar...if you don't know a lick about wine?  Not good.  She even went back to ask the \"manager\" for a wine suggestion based on what we told her we liked and then she brought out a taste of something that was absolutely opposite of what we described.    The other thing that brought my rating down is that they permit smoking on their patio.  When it is a small patio there is really no difference than if you were eating inside beside someone blowing smoke in your face.  We tried to move to another table but yet another smoker sat down beside us.  2 people at our table are highly affected by the smoke (headache, itchy eyes, etc) but we couldn't get away from it and the waitress just made light of it.  She went on to tell us how she smokes but how she puts the window down in her car because she doesn't even want her own smoke in her face.......crickets......  Needless to say, we got out of there quickly.  It was such a bad experience.  I know they usually have live music on the weekends but that wasn't the case and the overall feel of the place just seemed to drop down in terms of quality.  I hope they make some adjustments soon."}
{"text":"Great spot to split a bottle of wine and enjoy yummy cheese selection. Comfy seating and nice to have option of undo or outdoor seating. Friendly service, good selection."}
{"text":"We've heard good things and the reviews were good but after waiting for 10 minutes at a table with no service or even a \"hello, I'll be right with you\" we walked out.  Not a good first impression."}
