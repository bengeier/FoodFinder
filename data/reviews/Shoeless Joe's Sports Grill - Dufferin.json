{"text":"Got the all star platter it was horrible, didn't taste right, at least I had free refills on pop, they need to change oil or something, wings were overcooked, chicken tenders overcooked, the deep fried dill were ok."}
{"text":"I've frequented this facility on several occasions, during one of which I was complimented by an older gentleman in a slightly awkward exchange. It smells pleasant and is sufficiently clean but loses a full two stars for atrocious urinal arrangement (see profile pic). Not a dealbreaker but pushing the line."}
{"text":"8 times out of 10 this location is a complete disappointment but my coworkers and I only return because it is the only restaurant nearby that is open late and we work in the area. They treat us with little respect and constantly tell us the, \"kitchen is closed.\" Tonight my boyfriend and I walked in an hour and 30 minutes prior to their closing time and were told the kitchen was closed despite the fact that there were numerous customers in booths around us and one couple had just ordered. Coming from someone who works in the hospitality industry this is completely appalling and absolutely disrespectful. Completely understand if you close early depending on how business is but I don't understand why the hours listed online do not reflect this rule."}
{"text":"I use to love going to this place but the food has become bleh... it arrived luke warm NOT hot..it was colder inside the restaurant ...then outside... I feel sorry for some of the staff there I asked if there could be someway we could have more heat and was told the owner wont allow it and I asked arent you gold.. one girl said she is freezing... Um ok? Napkins were stained. Had to ask for a cleaner one..ew..Veggies werent cook all the way(not even the aldente standard).. we ordered two medium rare steaks one came almost right the other over done. My ribs were fatty as all get out. Later on my daughter and her boyfriend went and said the same thing food was horrible except for the baked pasta.. that was the only fresh HOT dish that came. Next time I will wait the 40min wait for Red Lobster at least for $100 I spent here I would have gotten my money worth. Wont be going back. Unless new owners take over...again.."}
{"text":"We came here during a Leafs game and found it absolutely packed. It also happened to be wing night.

The atmosphere is just like any sports bar. Tons of screen, dark wood, quite a bit of seating, comely servers. Since it was so busy, service was slow.

The wings were pretty disappointing. They were cooked fine, but pretty bland. Their sauce choices were basically the line of Frank's Red Hot sauces. 

I wasn't a big fan of this spot. It might be better when it's not so crazy."}
{"text":"I forgot exactly what I ordered but it was a beef burger with a baked potato. One of the driest and most bland burgers I have ever had for $13. The burger came with the beef patty, lettuce, pickles, and onions. Although I used a lot of ketchup, it the burger was not that great. The baked potato came out steaming hot, served with sour cream. Service was average."}
{"text":"UMMM...I'm torn to write this review...because I really really wanted to like this place a lot more...I thought that it was my new haven...but the truth shall set you free....

The place looks amazing....New furniture. TV's everywhere!!! including your booth...nice dim lighting. Lots of space...

However there are LOTS of things that are wrong with the place.

First off, there was an heavier set Hostess who greeted us when we walked in. We were thinking of being seated to the patio at first but since it was getting late and sort of cold outside, we changed our mind and said we will go to the bar instead. As emotionless as she was at greeting us; things got worst when we were seated. I asked , \"is there any drink specials?\"

she immediately walked away muttering with her back turned to us- \"i'll get your server\"

The only logic we came to the conclusion is that she is in charge of the patio area - and she is utterly disappointed that she wont have the pleasure of serving us. POSITIVITY?? right?

Anywho...Menu looked great ; however very pricey for PUB food. $13- $25 for wings that come with no sides . $15 for burger and fries. 

So we went for the wings- Trust me ...these things looked delicious. Crispy looking and Giant sized. Oh baby- I was ready to get my chicken wing on; then I took a bite. Dryer then the sahara dessert. I got out of this high end booth where my eyes were glued to the in booth television to flag down a waitress. She was wonderful, the sweet girl (Nadia i think) immediately went got us more Sauce. The wings were still dry as beef jerky but the extra sauce did help. 

The worst part though- Wings paid for...not going to fuss. Remind you, I asked for it extra saucy; so these things are drenched in the buffalo butter sauce (yummy sauce)...and guess what i see. FEATHERS...talk about appetite DONE!.

I flagged down Nadia- who immediately ran over. She told me, that it is a re-occurring problem with their wings and that is just how the wings they get are. Gross. I asked for the bill.

That was my first experience, but I am not saying it will be last. Very nice looking place- and with the $8.99 Schooners and also the $8.99 burger night. I will head back over there and give it another shot.

Shoelesss.....STEP UP YOUR GAME !!!"}
{"text":"Our hockey team has been to this place many times. Why? Because it's the closest bar to the nearby hockey arena. No other reason. It certainly isn't because of the overpriced food, which is merely serviceable, and the generic beer selection.

But last night hit new lows. We arrived at about 7:25 and promptly ordered. We asked for large fries to share before the main courses, and beer. The fries, which are merely a handful (I kid you not), come in a \"cute\" little fryer basket. Sorry, don't care about the presentation. Save your money and instead get us more fries. The fries were not hot and we sent them back. Still no beer. Then the beer comes. Then we wait.

And wait. And wait. The server, who was kind enough, explained that there was a big birthday party and that our order (only four food orders) was coming. But for some reason, the party of two sitting beside us, who arrived about 10 minutes after us, got their meals fairly quickly. 

So we waited some more. Got another round of \"birthday party\" excuses. Three of us finally had had enough and left. It was at this point that the server came over to the remaining three of us and told us that everything was on the house. We sat a few more minutes and then she returned and asked us if we still wanted our food. Odd question. Why, we asked? Because they had still not yet started the order. One hour later, and they had still not started the order.

We left. I'll advocate for the team that we find another place. 

Have you ever seen 3200 Dufferin? It has to be the ugliest example of semi-suburban malls: endless concrete, drab, grey, and designed for cars. It's hideous. A perfect fit for Shoeless Joe's"}
{"text":"Came in here to watch the Leafs game. Shoeless Joe's was a place I used to hit up as a teen to watch the game and it was always a well run chain. Tonight, half the tables were empty but hadn't been bussed and were still dirty. No one standing at the hostess stand so I sat myself down and waited ten minutes. Ignored by all the wait-staff so I left. This place has an unkempt vibe to it. Avoid."}
{"text":"Don't live anywhere close to here but enjoyed the buffalo chicken strips. Came here to watch the raptors game, Valentina was our server and made sure our TV played the game. She was overall very attentive and kind, Would visit again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE ! It was our second time here to watch a leafs game (as they have booths with personal tvs), the service is HORRIBLE. Wait staff doesn't acknowledge you (wasn't til 10 minutes later she got our drink order), food came 30 mins after, the server's excuse was \"we had a lot of chicken wing orders tonight\". You're a restaurant, you have to expect to get a lot of good orders! Telling me you had a lot of wing orders?! And what good is a manager coming over to speak to me when I've been waiting more than half an hour for my dinner?!

There is nothing positive about this place I can write about, I will never recommend this place to anyone...oh wait - one good thing: free wifi."}
{"text":"Oh man, how could I not review this place?

So - full disclosure, they were getting ready for a basketball game that was going to start around 6pm or something?  What do I know about basketball.  But here's the thing - my group walked in at 3:30.  And they were all, \"you know, you can't be here.  It's all reserved,\" to which we said, \"that's cool.  We'll be gone soon.  Just in for a bit after work.\" 

And that was that.  So we wanted a quick drink, some apps, and that would be just great for us.  So we ordered our drinks, and ordered our apps.  And some of the drinks came - and then we re-ordered our drinks because we were told we didn't order our drinks.  Then the drinks came.  Mine was a blue freezie.  I recommend it.  It tastes just like what you want it to.  Good for it!

Then our drinks were done, and we wondered where our food was.  It was lost in the void of the kitchen.  After a delay that was just way to long for a mostly-empty establishment it came.  It was ok.  Nothing special.

Anyway - you do you.  Maybe you'll like it?  The drink was good, after all."}
{"text":"went here after watching my buddy play hockey. It was pretty cold in the arena so the natural thing to do after the game, get beer. Was pretty empty, but it's probably due to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. The staff was pretty nice even though it was close to closing. 3 guiness, 2 moosehead and an order of sliders, $50. Not bad."}
{"text":"My nephew took me here and it's such a nice chill spot. The people were friendly and loved the chicken wings here. It's one of my go to spots for wings because of the Buffalo Butter chicken wings. They are addictive. I ordered 2 pounds of it and believe me when I said I was in heaven. Also got the nachos. I was blessed. 

I'be gotten a chance to talk to the manager and he's such a good person. Definitely coming back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Shoeless Joe's in quite some time, but randomly came in after driving around the west-side of town. 

ATMOSPHERE: Was late afternoon/early evening, so enough sun was shining to justify trying the patio out. Though the patio seemed somewhat oddly positioned in relation to the restaurant, the clear glass panes meant lots of sunlight if you are into that kind of thing. If it were later, the indoor part of the restaurant offered plenty of seating/booths with a fair amount of TV's surrounding the premises.

FOOD: After the waitress dissuaded me from trying the Philly Steak, I went with \"Truffle Wild Mushroom Burger.\" Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much - I was pleasantly surprised though. The prime rib burger was actually quite tender and flavorful, with the mushrooms and other topics much fresher than expected. For the burger itself, I would give it a 4.5. 

Unfortunately my friend was not as lucky with her selection. Despite our attempts to get some 'intel' on what to expect from the \"Southern Fried Chicken Sliders,\" the waitresses recommendation was quite disappointing. The \"sliders\" were essentially a few (and small) dried up pieces of breaded chicken breast on seemingly stale buttered biscuits. This was disappointing given its description, and the potential it had.

SUMMARY: Aside from a questionable recommendation, service was good enough. I might return just for the prime rib burger or to watch a game inside...likely won't go out of my way to come back however."}
{"text":"Service is HORRIBLE! Yes, the waiters are friendly, however waiting for them to approach you, take your order, bring you the stuff (e.g. water, food, etc.) took forever, literally more than 30 minutes. Getting one pint of beer (when we literally sat by the bar) took 30 minutes!! Don't go here if your starving, because the wait time is ridiculous. However, the food here tastes pretty good."}
