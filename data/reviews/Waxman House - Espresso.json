{"text":"This café is hidden at the back of Waxman (a formal-wear store, which is kind of an institution in Montréal). I met up with a friend here and she immediately fell in love with place. From the docile dog roaming around the shop to the wedding photos along the walls, it has a unique, sparse vibe to it. The barista and owner (I think) were very friendly while the drinks were being made. I was entertained by the verbal sparring/witty banter between my friend and the owner. Needless to say, it was a great experience and the coffee is good. Check it out."}
{"text":"A real find. Stumbled upon this place one AM, down the block from my Airbnb. Best cappuccino I've ever had, and the most welcoming folks around. Quite a storied history to this place. Well worth a stop, whether you need coffee, a haircut, a tux, or all three. Or if you just want to check out the Harley in the window."}
{"text":"A hidden cafe tucked in the back of a historic business on Parc, I like this by default already. Beautiful bar, delicious sandwiches, good coffee, another secret back room with a barber, big friendly dogs walking around, sweet little seats by a back window. Worth checking out if you're in the area and want to duck in to a place full of history and lots of love. Also, word is, maybe there's a bit of a speakeasy here sometimes, but you didn't hear it from me."}
