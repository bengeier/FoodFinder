{"text":"I walk up to Ele's Fresh looking at what they had. The women owner starts to make me a plate. She tells me that the fish is Mahi Mahi.So I get the fish. By the way I am from Hawaii so I know Mahi Mahi. I give her my money and she puts my change off to the side of me. Then she gives me napkins again putting it off to the side. So I sit down bite into the fish and its not Mahi Mahi. So by this time I am really mad.Poor  service and on top of  that she lies about the fish. The fish was a cheap muddy tasting fish. Not at all happy. I would never go back there to eat. Sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a find!! They give samples so you can try before you buy but the chicken and rib eye is so amazing and their portions are a great size!"}
{"text":"We decided to  go to the boulevard mall on a Saturday afternoon. Shopping made us hungry so we decided to try the food court for lunch. We were looking for something fairly healthy. This place seemed like the best choice. There was a man and woman behind the counter and a little girl. The man was very friendly. He gave us a sample of chicken which was delicious!  We had a plate with salad, grilled veggies, roasted potato and some of that really good chicken. I've read some reviews in which yelpers found the man behind the counter (which I guess is the owner) as being pushy but my family and I found him to be very nice and somewhat entertaining. The food was good. Everything tasted fresh and we were very pleased with our lunch!"}
{"text":"The owner seems a bit pushy. And some things just doesnt seem right. Hummus dry. I asked for a sandwhich and he just throws the things on the plate. The meat is ok. But customer service will put his business out. One worker tried to help correct him but he just kept on doing what he wanted. I was only here in vegas to take some time off and I wanted to try something away from the strip. Biggest mistake ever."}
{"text":"While shopping at the boulevard mall we were checking out the food court. We were undecided what we wanted to have. We had never heard of this place.
There was a woman behind the counter and said we needed to try these beef Kabobs I think there was a couple of different kinds.
We bought the beef.
It came in a tomatoes sauce that was delicious. What wonderful flavor!
The beef was really great! 
I would rate a 5 but this is all we tried. The next time we go to the mall we would for sure try something else.
This is a must try! So yummy!!!! ****
A great find!!"}
