{"text":"A new sushi place in Mont-Royal. They have a nice combination of options (Vegetarian, with fruits, Maki, Sushi, Sashimi and etc). People there are friendly and welcoming. We had a take-out late evening and ordered a combination of everything there and got a good deal. It was tasty but not fresh. If I want to test their Sushi again I will go sometime other than late evening."}
{"text":"1 hour before closing, they have a few pieces left, everything is dry, rice was almost crunchy and you pay the regular price. Combination flavours are weird if you asked me."}
{"text":"There executive chef is the best she's the sweetest person in the whole wide world, she's and very talented chef, she made me enjoy my time there"}
{"text":"A pretty new spot from what I was told by their staff. Great corner location, and somewhat unassuming from the outside - however, entering leads you to a unique tidy \"flagship\" look.

They have a large display case with colourful sushi rolls, bowls, sushi pizzas, and Asian inspired desserts. A super clean preparation area in the front area (they'd already made the food by that time, so perhaps not always pristine).

Neat colour coordinated d√©cor. Welcoming and enthusiastic staff and management, and because they were so nice, I tried a verrine of mango and coconut pudding which was tasty, but quite small and over priced at 4.99 + taxes. 

Hmm, seems the chia coconut and banana pudding is only 3.99 which is not as bad - so why the extra buck for another flavour - perhaps the mango is more expensive? Still for that size 3.99 + taxes would be a lot more fairly priced - just sayin'.

Their individual sushi concept goes like this... you mix and match to create your own box from 17 standard listed creations (special until end of August for .99 cents/piece on selected sushi makis). Make into a trio for 3.99 + taxes.

Better go and grab that deal ASAP, and save .49 cents/piece on a few pieces at least.

Note: Will have to review again once tried more food. The current rating is based on the rest."}
