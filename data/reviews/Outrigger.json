{"text":"the managers scream at employees in front of customers. also, how do you eff up spaghetti and meatballs? yuck"}
{"text":"There was a problem with my order but they brought me a new one and didn't charge me. Sometimes mistakes are made but it's how the restaurant reacts that makes the difference. Tasty food too."}
{"text":"The breakfasts are great, but the last few dinner dishes I had there were terrible. Little content and way too many vegetables!! I mean 80% of both meals I had there were vegetables and little seafood or chicken. Next time I will refuse the food unless they actually fix the issue! Its too bad as the breakfasts are actually fine. One last comment is the Butter Chicken dish... What is with all of the Green Peppers?? I have had a lot of BC in my day, and never have I ever had Green Peppers in mine!!"}
{"text":"Patio is nice in the summer.  What we don't go here for is the food. I have yet to not be disappointed with my meals here as have my companions.  Maybe it is the huge menu and they just can't be good at everything?"}
{"text":"Food used to be decent and one of the better places to go in the Beach.  Dined on June 19th with some friends.  I must say the food was mediocre at best.  Chicken Parmigiana was overly deep fried (not baked) and barely had any sauce or cheese on it.  I have ordered this at least 5 times over the years and it used to be delicious.  Either it was an off night for them or they have different kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Only place in the Beaches that never has a line for breakfast, but isn't indicative of poor food. Traditional bacon and eggs breakfast is under $10, and quite good. Great patio - but mind the wasps. Guy server is sarcastic and borderline rude, which makes us question ever returning. But when the line is too long at Vi Vethas, its a decent second choice."}
{"text":"The patio is quite nice with pretty plants and a waterfall.  The staff are very pleasant.   Inside it's a bit eclectic in the decor and it's hard to find a \"quiet\" table.  We live down the street and would like to come more often like we did when it was Quiglies Bar and Pub but the place is very much for families and we just get tired of the loud kids.  The menu is very extensive and the prices are actually quite good.  The big problem is that they make any substitutions very difficult so if you're lactose intolerant or you just don't like something like mushrooms too bad.   So for a menu of about a dozen pages I can order maybe 2 or 3 things.  In my opinion they're busy because the location is one of the best in the Beach but I'm almost always disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"There are several poor sports bars in the Beaches. Which is why I was really hoping that the new Outrigger Restaurant would be different.  Let's start with the positives.  1) The decor and design is nice. It seems a little classy for what should be it's main clientele - 25-50yr old Beachers who just want affordable food, good service and a chance to get away from the franchise Pubs or dirtier spots. It feels/looks more like a narrow Keg than anything else. Which is fine/great. 8.5/10  2) Food. Not necessarily a positive. The wings are small, cheap, and unenthusiastic. To be honest...we only tried apps...not the mains. We had the app platter and calamari and wings and fries and the dip. Overall the food wasn't off-putting. I'd give the food a 6/10.   Now the negatives.  1) You have multiple large high end TV's surrounding your long bar and front sitting areas. You're in the Beach. For those reasons alone....you better play the Leafs games. I avoid other Beach sports pubs because of poor service or food or whatever....so when I come to your place and see the TV's and the bar and the clientele....I expect the Leafs Game! Do yourself a favor and get Leafs TV so that you don't lose business you could be stealing from other places. It's a small expense.   2) SERVICE. They don't care at all. The beer looked flat. The bartender knew it but made me \"test\" it. Yup. Flat. The other beer keg was empty. They spent 10min just trying to get me a beer. I ordered a side of fries with the wings. \"They actually come with the wings\" Great. Wings took FOREVER to arrive. 20min later...wings come....no fries. Still no beer. I'm half way thru the wings when I can finally get the attention of my server (most of them we're too busy bickering about some internal politics/conflict within the establishment). No I don't want the fries now. I'll take a gin/tonic instead. That takes 5min. Meanwhile, there's some dirty looks and attitude from most of the employees.  I voiced my concerns to the head bartender/waitress. No Leafs, no fries, no beer, no service, no apology. I asked for the bill. She ran around for ANOTHER 5min trying to find the manager. She finally gets the owner/manager (50yr old east-indian woman), takes her aside and explains what has occurred. The manager looks very stern, shakes her head.  I get the bill. Of course...no complements from the owner/manager. I look over to the owner/manager. She stares me down...like I did something wrong. I get a dirty look from her and then she walks away. Not a word to me. THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF BAD SERVICE....when you get a chance to make something right (several chances) and then you don't. It just shows that YOU DON'T CARE.  MAYBE I'll go back next year (I like to give bad places a chance to change).  Overall the service just left a horrible feeling for me and my partner."}
{"text":"Sorry Outrigger, but all I wanted on a Sunday morning was bacon and a coffee... you could have politely poured some coffee and threw some slices of bacon on the saucer and I would have been a happy camper. Instead, my friend and I sit on the lovely patio for 23 minutes before getting a cup of weak coffee (which was spilled all over my saucer, no bacon). This was after asking 2 different waitresses for coffee, which resulted in a waiter finally bringing it out. It took almost 35 minutes for a simple, 3 eggs brekkie, all of which was mediocre. Toast was cold. A table next to us with three women had 3 food errors in their breakfast: 1. wrong omelett, 2. wrong toast 3. wrong omlett removed and then a double wrong omlett returned. This wasn't even my personal experience, but I was frustrated eavesdropping on it.  This is such a prime location; the patio is lovely and relaxing, but the non-existent service and lack of caffiene in my coffee made me sad. And breakfast sad is the worst type of sad."}
{"text":"For the guy who wrote below, Leafs TV is like $2000 a year now for small businesses and pubs, probably why they don't show it. Once MLSE jacked up the prices from $2.99 a month a ton of bars stopped showing them.  Anyway, I went with my girlfriend last Sunday on a great day and walk in the Beaches area. I recall this used to be Honeys Bistro and we gave the new place a try based off their menu outside and thought their prices were rather reasonable for the area. It's literally a block from one of the nicest streets in Toronto  We were rather simple and just ordered a pair of burgers and decided to split them as to give ourselves a sample of both. Both burgers came with a small caesar or mixed greens to start.  The first burger was a grilled mushroom and cheddar burger and it was rather sizeable (I'm a hungry man and can eat a lot). The bun was lightly toasted which was a great touch and the fries were done nicely, you can tell they used fresh oil. 9/10  The other was a greek style burger with feta cheese and the verdict was more or less the same, tasty. The price for both was $12 which I feel is solid value given the location, nice patio and quality of food. We also found the servers to be rather attentive but not annoying either."}
{"text":"Picked this spot because of the patio after an afternoon walk at the beaches.   Service was friendly, food was decent.  I had Fish Tacos and was pleasantly surprised.   My wife had chicken fingers.   My brother in law had a clubhouse.  We all enjoyed our meals. The draft beer was cold and tasty.  Don't know how it compares to other pubs or restaurants in the area, but this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Decent food, price and portions and what you would expect for a pub. However, the waitress was only sort of hot, and not very hot like you would expect. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Went here again with my mom and boyfriend for dinner one night. We walked in, all the staff looked at us and went back to whatever they were doing - this included the owner (yes I know who you are!). I timed it on my phone it took us 3 minutes for anyone to even come to the hostess stand. Our waiter was really nice, very good service and checked in regularly but you could tell he had too many tables to take care of. I ordered the Cobb salad which was so gross. There were maybe two little bacon bits in it, the avocado wasn't ripe yet and some pieces of lettuce were brown and soggy. I had such high hopes after my first experience that this was truly a let down."}
{"text":"Great patio. The service is ok, the food can be really hit or miss. Recommend their in-house made chicken fingers...even the kids size is a decent portion. They are very good. The fish tacos are good too.  The burgers have been underdressed and dry everytime. I had the Greek burger, was disappointed & had to wave down staff to ask for condiments to try and add some moisture/flavour...it only came w a smudge of feta.  The French onion soup was ok, broth a bit water-y and was given \"toasted\" French bread to go with it. The bread had barely seen the grill and should've sat under the salamander or in an actual toaster instead of being grazed across a grill cooking other foods....was essentially dry bread w a cpl marks of charring on it.  Was also disappointed with the breakfast...eggs & bacon done well (not easy to mess up there) but the obviously pre made and very sad looking fruit kebab was a waste and inedible and the toast came dry as well...which is their policy, but apparently they will bring butter if you ask--at this point the toast is no longer hot & butter won't spread well. The eggs Benny were better, again with the sad fruit...but good enough breakfast. Otherwise, the food is basic pub grub with an extensive menu which has likely led to the majority of it being mediocre w a few stand outs."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the Outrigger bar. It's a nice family friendly restaurant that I would visit again :)"}
{"text":"Decent food and unbeatable patio in the beaches. It can get quite busy during the summer but it's to be expected in such a prime location. Service is pretty standard, some days great, some days not so great. I'll give it five stars just for the patio and location though."}
{"text":"Great little local spot. Cozy. Brunch is a must here...service is slow but great grub. Drink specials from 3-5 and from 9 till close. The patio is great in the summer"}
{"text":"We came here on a holiday, so there were not a lot of options around. The service was really good. Nice and courteous, however the food was blah."}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful Sunday evening around 6pm with some friends.  The patio was full (a good 20 tables out there), so we opted to just eat inside instead of waiting, and we were the only ones in there.  Another 20 tables inside at least, so the place would hold close to 100 I would guess.  On one of the quieter corners in the Beaches, a great little walking neighborhood.  The patio has a cozy feel, with split levels, lots of greenery, a little water fountain, basic black wrought iron bistro style tables.  Inside has many art paintings that run the full length of the long, narrow layout, with a large bar near the front that has about a dozen chairs at it.  Bathrooms in the basement.  Stairs are a bit narrow, so be careful walking down them, especially if you have had a drink or two!  :)  Delicious frozen mango mojitos and raspberry margaritas.  I didn't look at the full drink menu because I was thirsty and went straight for the frozen section, seeing those right away, not glancing at the rest.  Very good Spinach and Cheese Ravioli ($17 tossed with wild mushrooms, spinach, julienne vegetables. Served in a rose sauce.).  There were only seven or eight ravioli 'pouches' but lots of vegetables and I couldn't actually finish the dish.  Good side Caesar.  The others in my group all enjoyed their meals but I forget what they had.  LOL    Standard, friendly service.  Would definitely go back and like to try their breakfast on the patio for sure."}
{"text":"My sandwich was $15 worth of absolute AWFUL. Turkey is obviously the store bought, pre-packaged kind that tastes like preservatives and seasonings. Bacon tasted strongly like old fish, fries were also the frozen, battered, synthetic potatoes that just tasted fake. I still have a fishy taste in my mouth from the disgusting bacon. Never eating here again. Overpriced cheap yucky food. Ew.   35 minutes for takeout - one sandwich and fries - they told me 20. Had to wait at the bar while they fought amongst themselves and ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. It was chaos. People were having to come up to the bar to order, no one was being seated timely. It wasn't even that busy. About 1/4 of the tables were occupied.   I've also had the fish tacos here and they were not good either. Not authentic in the least, salsa was too sugary. And the cocktails were not very good either. This place is extremely overpriced for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This location has been a disaster for several years now. Quigleys near the end of its run, Honey Beestro. Outrigger has invested in the space in attempt to bring people back to the corner of Queen and Beech. They are trying to appeal to several Beach demographics: sports fans, families, couples for nice dinner hence the jazz music as soundtrack for Leaf games on big screen TV's and the gynormous menu with everything from wings to pastas, fish, steak etc...It's a bit of an awkward fit, but I understand that to survive, they'll need a broad range of patrons. The March opening means they will hopefully have staff ready for the patio crush in the Spring when the volume of customers will double. Our waiter was quite good and we enjoyed our fish tacos. It has potential to be a good Beach option so give it a try."}
{"text":"As a Beacher, I can attest that this place is truly no better than the joint it replaced: Quigleys.  It's quite pricey however what you're paying for is that fine patio on the east side of the property....within 10 steps of Ed's Ice Cream in one direction and The Remarkable Bean in the other, this is prime Beach real estate.  I've eaten here probably about a dozen times since it opened and here's what I've noticed:  - Nachos - they use canned tomato sauce instead of salsa or chili or even just leaving them plain.  I've always had to special order them and remind the server to bring sour cream and guac.  - Fish and Chips - these were the most popular item on their menu and rightly so....fish was hand dipped and chips were done to perfection.  BUT.....they've gotten cheap and are using some frozen fish patties now.  Can you say Captain Highliner?  - Burgers - these used to be a signature item however they've gone cheap with these too  Previously made with hand formed fresh patties......the restaurant is now using cheap frozen pre-formed patties.  And even with lesser quality (aka cheaper items) being served the prices have never been lowered.  If you want a couple of drinks on the patio, go for it.....if you want a decent meal head elsewhere."}
{"text":"My fiance and I chose this spot for an early dinner because of the outdoor patio. It's cute and inviting on a sunny summer's evening. The entrance is confusing - you have to walk through the indoor restaurant, the server area and then down an outdoor alleyway while dodging gardening equipment to get to the front patio. We were seated at a tiny table not suitable for eating a meal at - our plates plus drinks could hardly fit on the table, not to mention the fact that the closed umbrella was not tied up and was hanging/blowing in our faces while we were trying to have a conversation.   The service was good, our waitress was attentive and friendly. We received our drinks quickly, which by the way were the best part of the evening. Well-priced, decent size and delicious.  The food was average at best. We ordered the fried chicken with corn bread and the lobster grilled cheese. The fried chicken was dry, overcooked and flavourless. The grilled cheese was literally just a ridiculous amount of cheese on bread - I had to search to find the lobster. I realise this is a gastropub and we didn't dine here expecting fine dining, but I could have made better at home. The flavour was seriously lacking for both meals and the presentation was sloppy.  I would come here again only to sit outside and have a drink."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Service was fine. But I won't eat here again. Grilled cheese was hard. Literally hard! Asian salad was so covered in little noodles that it looked like something from some sort of novelty restaurant like Rain Tree Cafe or something. I kept half expecting a clown to come by and ask me how I liked the salad. Too bad. This is a great location."}
{"text":"3rd time here.......Close to work. Their burgers are good. Tried the Old fashioned burger and outrigger burger both nice and good size burgers.  Nice and friendly service. Plenty of seating good for groups. Nice little patio.  French fries are good and crunchy. Nice interior.  Recommend."}
{"text":"This is a really lovely restaurant in the Beaches.  I've tried a wide variety of the menu items and never been disappointed.  My favourite is probably the salmon kabobs but the chicken ones are also worth trying.  I would recommend the seafood linguine which, unlike some places, doesn't scrimp on the seafood.  The service here is always friendly and the prices are not too bad given it's in the Beaches.  The decor is worth noting as they have paintings on the wall which are for purchase."}
{"text":"I think it's all been said but I will reiterate some things based on my two experiences here.  1) Portion sizes are HUGE but food is very mediocre pub food 2) Had the same server twice who was much friendlier on one occasion but overall gave off a bit of a pretentious attitude 3) Sat outside once and inside once... would not like to come back in the winter again (if ever) because the patio is the only good place to sit  The Beaches really need to get some better food options going as the general theme seems to be huge portion sizes and poor taste."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night. Sat on the multilevel patio which has a lovely flower garden and small waterfall in the centre. The review goes downhill from here however. Lots of bees everywhere making it impossible to enjoy a beer or a meal. They have a Leffe Blonde sign up on the building but don't carry it. I ordered the ribs and wing combo ($22) thinking it would be filling, but alas a couple from-the-freezer ribs, a couple from-the-freezer wings and sad mash potatoes. Green salad that came as the appetizer was fine though. Had a bite of my dinning partner's grilled cheese, worse meals she's had all year.  I would have paid $12 for this experience which cost me over $30. Great location and patio, average service, horrible food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I came here with family on a lovely warm evening for drinks and food. The food was great, the neighbourhood is fantastic, and we all had a great time. My only complaint was my mixed drink - not good, sorry.   Between us we had an appetizer and burgers, and we all left pleasantly full and happy. I also really like the atmosphere and layout of this restaurant. The patio is great with different levels creating separate dining spaces in an open dining concept. It's also surrounded by beautiful trees and the old architecture of the area.   Looking forward to going back, but might stick with a beer or wine next time."}
{"text":"I reserved at the last minute 10 people for 10pm on a friday night and it was available, instantly. The service was great and they were very welcoming. The place was some what empty, but we didn't mind since its a small restaurant. I liked the large menu because i like having alot of options and the food was amazing. Lastly, the decor and the vibe of the restaurant was totally what i was looking for, it's fancy but it's also got some edge. There was beautiful paintings displayed all over the walls and the music was soothing. Overall, i loved it and i wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"Definitely a huge improvement over Honeys Beestro. Menu might is a little long. I would rather see less, but more creative dishes. Having said that, the food we ordered was good. Service was friendly if a little slow. We were there shortly after it opened, so I'm assuming things will smooth out before the summer patio season starts. GET SOME CREEMORE on tap."}
{"text":"This is actually a 3.5-4 star review.  Visited this little spot in The Beaches neighbourhood for brunch with two friends.  The outside of the shop makes it look small but inside the place is spacious and nicely decorated.  The stain glass lamps above the table give it a bit of a cozy charm.  The menu is expansive but we were there to brunch and brunch we did!  Service is fast and attentive even though the prime brunch hour had past.  This was a good sign. :-)  I had the steak (rare) & eggs (sunny-side up) and it came as advertised.  They hit the temperature of the steak nicely and it was a tasty 6oz piece of protein.  I also really liked the option of challah bread instead of just the choice of white or brown.  Everything just tasted clean, fresh, and was very appetizing.  You can't ask for more from a brunch spot."}
{"text":"Food are amazing especially the lobster spinach dip. The burgers are amazing portion is worth the price. The down side is there were a lot flys flying around in the restaurant when we were there. Making us uncomfortable. Would come back only of they clean up a bit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. Hip neighborhood and priced well. Fast service and perfect sized portions! We had burgers, beer, wings and wine. I was surprised on how good the chicken wings were! If you are a wing lover try the honey & garlic wings...really impressive and a fair sized portion!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner for 4 at the Outrigger. Food was great and price matched the quality. Great family restaurant for Friday nights. They were also great with our little 3 year old. Definitely recommended for families!"}
{"text":"It is very cozy place. The server was friendly and deserve her tips! They have a good variety of options of food! I got sausage linguine which was amazingly presented and I liked the caesar salad. They also don't let you down on beer, good selection!  You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is alright, certainly a great patio for the summertime. It attempts to replicate what Quigley's once did so well, and for the most part it pulls it off. The food is certainly no more than mediocre though, but the atmosphere works well for a refined pub. The nachos are okay, though the tomato sauce addition is...unique. Unfortunately the caesar (drink) is terrible, so caesar lovers beware. Essentially ok for a patio beer and a snack, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Really great service by all the staff.  Fish tacos were divine as recommended (good portion,  $14). I wanted so bad to order more items off the menu, like the buttermilk calamari or the creamy tilapia with grilled lobster and spinach but I didn't want to overdo it. There's always extra room for cocktails though!  Perfect mango martini with extra  shot for only $3 (my kinda place!)  and sweet refreshing white sangria. Will be back next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy eating at this place. I think because I go their so often I just accept the few things that are a bit off. The service is great from the majority of the staff. The wait staff that has been rude or not really hospitable don't really last that long. I enjoy the food and find them really accommodating when making changes on the item I want to order. I give it 5 stars because the only complaint that I have is that I get charged for everything. I have never had any extra cost waived (like extra cheese cheese or bread). But that does not bring the rating down in anyway. I respect their business values and accept that this isn't a place that regulars get any little extras."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Outriggers today in the Beach. Nicely shaded patio.  Great food and great patio for lunch.  Had the butter chicken sandwich served on a naan bread pita with garden side salad.  Definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"I typically end most of my reviews with a thumbs up or down to if I think the business is 'Worth the trip', but this time I'm going to start the review by telling you it's worth the trip! And it's all thanks to one dish: The fish and chips. The worst thing about it is the fries are lightly battered which I've never been a big fan of, but they're good. Very good. Would be better with classic cut dinner fries, but these are still rock and roll. The best part of the meal is the fish: fresh, moist and flakey, no dry bits, and perfectly battered in a nice flavorful beer batter that's reminiscent of the fish and chips I got while on vacation in Halifax. Hands down the best fish and chips I've had here in Toronto. Price was very fair at $14. The trip was a long way from my hood on Queen West to the end of Queen east, but it was worth it. Just awesome.  The rest of the menu is also good. I was there with a friend who lives in the neighborhood, and they told me the burgers are pasta looked and smelled good but we're not very flavorful. I haven't tried them yet, they both looked and smelled good, but you don't know 100% until you try them.   Friend had the fish tacos which he said was the best in the city and that he'd ever tasted. I had a bite of the fish and it was moist and flakey as well, nice flavor to the sauce. The edamame is also very good, great sauce as well and lots of pods.  It's a gastro-pub in The Beaches, so it's not going to be cheap. For a pub I found the prices overall were higher, but for the best fish and chips in Toronto, can you put a price on that?  WORTH THE TRIP!"}
{"text":"I've seen many up and down reviews of this place, and can't speak to others' experiences, but my wife and I had a fantastic meal here. Went in for brunch on family day, and had some great food and great service. Maybe we got lucky, but we'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good drinks and cocktails. Salads are the best in the beaches. Love the patio in the summer. Beautiful spot!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" place for wine and apps.  The staff are friendly.  Their chicken quesadilla is super-licious.  Edamame can be made just plain, and they are willing within reason to adjust their ingredients.   Flexibility is key.  Location is wonderful."}
{"text":"I have no idea where the ill reviews derive their vitriol. My experience this week was entirely blissful. From the sublime patio to the sound of the waterfall the setting is without equal. The waitress who was from Nova Scotia was both courteous and personal. Food excellent. Would I return? Without hesitation. You be the judge."}
{"text":"Outrigger is in the heart of The Beaches area. When my girl friend suggested we meet there for lunch I had no idea what a good experience it would be.  We sat outside in their patio and were served right away.  Great menu.  As I waited for my glass of vino I watched many dishes being served.  I was salivating as everyone looked good. What to order?  Ended up with their seafood salad which was delicious. Not your typical Pub food.  Staff were very pleasant and our server was very friendly.  Would definitely go back for more then just wine."}
{"text":"It's a solid local - that's for sure. The food menu is vast - and surprisingly decent considering how many items they have...and the prices are just amazing. Drink wise, good selection of beer on tap - poor selection in a bottle (I like that personally).  Service wise, awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate there last week. Good food. Good service when I was there. Though I somehow left my Bose earphones there and they said they had it the first time I called. I even went back afterwards but somehow they said the owner locked it in a safe somewhere. Called a few times back for a few days. Never got it back. I'm typing this in front of a Best Buy now. I guess new earphones for me then."}
{"text":"Went there after dinner for a drink before heading home. Nice terrace and friendly waitress but took a good 20 minutes to get a bad house wine and a flat beer. Not likely to go back and try their food."}
