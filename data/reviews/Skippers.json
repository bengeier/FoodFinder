{"text":"We went for lunch and we had the cod dog and fries, which was good but the fries were terrible, greasy, very dark and cold/undercooked.  My co-worker had the lobster mac and cheese. The price initially was $13.95 but in 3 weeks they just increased their price to $17.00, which was exorbitant considering it was not mac & cheese but dried pasta with some oil and little parmesan cheese and a very small piece of lobster tail. When we told her this is not what mac & cheese looks like, where is the cheese sauce, she sprinkled some parmesan cheese. She replied they changed their recipe but actually it looks like the same as always no cheese sauce and a skimpy piece of lobster for $17.00 was outrageous. The clam chowder and lobster roll is good."}

The resto itself is quite small and has a counter service concept for eating there and perfect for  take-outs. It seats about 20 people. This resto offers great deal combos and the food is delicious. You order your food at the counter and then the super friendly staff will bring you your order. We tried the combo of delicious clam chowder and 1/4 lobster, giant shrimps served with salad and rice. All were super fresh and delicious.  We also sampled their hugely popular cod dogs...breaded cod served in hot dog buns with  coleslaw and fries!  They have many seafood options to select from so more reason to go back! A friend also tried their lobster mac and cheese which was quite tasty but needed more cheese. Overall, I highly recommend this great treasure find to all seafood lovers which opened its doors less than 6 weeks ago !  You will not be disappointed. Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastically friendly and attentive staff. Fast and courteous service. And damn good fish and seafood. Unpretentious and delicious. This isn't a fancy place. It's a welcoming place with good food. 
It's fast becoming one of my favorites. I recommend the lobster poutine and the seafood nachos."}
