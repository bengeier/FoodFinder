{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant I have tried so far.

 Good quality+great portion size (dinner)+super friendly service+great vibes. Love their \"thick\" version of sushi/sashimi. 

Dinner is better. The sashimi portion size for lunch isn't enough for me. Try their mango cheesecake for dessert. So good!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few Japanese restaurants that is actually operated by Japanese people (majority are Chinese).  That is not to say Chinese operations are bad (I'm Chinese btw) but I find the Japanese one's more authentic as they are more meticulous in both preparation and presentation.  However, they do tend to be more expensive and offer less quantity so be warned if you are hungry like Kobayshi (Google him if you don't know who he is) and expect large portions.

I've been here several times over the past couple of years when we don't want to venture too far from our area (work near Yonge-Bloor) and if I'm not too hungry. Items are pretty much a la carte and the bento boxes are decent portions but pricier than other places.  The service is typical Japanese... very efficient and servers are pleasant.  4 star rating."}
{"text":"It gets busy and loud at lunch time, food was good. Had chicken teriyaki, it comes with miso soup, rice and salad. Nice deco, feels very cozy."}
{"text":"Ichiriki is a inconspicuous little Japanese-run restaurant. Like most other eateries in this area, they draw a big lunch crowd from all the nearby offices. However, after-hours Ichiriki is just as lively. Aside from a seasonal omakase menu and a monthly live jazz band night, every Tuesday evening they welcome Soba Canada to take over the kitchen and serve fresh handmade authentic soba.

Recommended Orders:

Chirashi ($24) : pretty presentation, fresh fish, and reasonable value given the area that it's located in. Nothing to complain about.

Urajiro ($9, Deep fried shiitaki mushrooms with shrimp paste) : 
This was our favourite dish of the night. Succulent shiitake mushrooms are filled with a shrimp fish paste, and deep fried tempura-style. They went light on the seasoning here, but it allows allows the sweet dipping sauce to highlight the earthy shiitake aroma. A highly recommended order!

Karaage ($6, Deep Fried Chicken) : a deliciously moist chunks of meat wrapped in a light, non-greasy batter. It wasn't overly crunchy like I would've preferred, but I'd probably still place it on of my list of contenders for best karaage's in Toronto.

Green Tea Pudding ($3):  Every bite is smooth, creamy, and potent with matcha. Delicious! Free on Monday evenings with a $30 bill."}
{"text":"If you've had real Japanese food, you'll steer clear of this place. Disorganized service and terrible food with a high price tag slapped on. 

We ordered a-la-carte, Tako Kimuchi (Kimchi Octopus), Uni Sushi, Negi-toro roll, Shrimp Tempura Soba, Salmon Collar and Cheese Isobe. 

Here's how it came out (in order):
1) Tako Kimuchi ($7.00) - a small bowl of sliced boiled octopus with kimchi sauce and raw cucumbers. A tasty combination but an overpriced appetizer. 

2) Uni sushi ($8.00 for two pieces) - I'm a big fan of uni, and while I'm biased just to the basic flavour, I sadly had to acknowledge that it wasn't very fresh at all. For the same price, I recommend trying the uni at Japango. Amazing.

3) Negitoro roll ($8.00)- chopped fatty tuna with green onion - everything EXCEPT the fish itself was good. Premium Japanese sushi rice but sadly, the toro could not be tasted at all. Very disappointing.

4) Shrimp Tempura Soba ($15.00) - three pieces of shrimp tempura sitting in soba and hot soup. For the hefty price, I was expecting hand made soba or at least tasty broth... something on the level of what you would get (for half the price) in Japan. I applaud them for using real dashi stock in their broth, but otherwise there isn't anything positive to say.

About this time, nothing was coming to our table. We were still waiting for the Cheese Isobe and the Salmon Collar. We asked a waitress about them and she said they were coming. Shortly afterwards, the Cheese Isobe came.

5) Cheese Isobe ($4.00) - Four pieces of Philli cream cheese, wrapped in seaweed, then rolled in bread bits and deep fried. Yeah, this was probably was a bad choice on our end but as soon as we saw it we felt a little bit sick. Let me say, this is not very Japanese and was ridiculously rich. It reminded me of something you could order at a Chinese run all-you-can eat Japanese establishment. One bite was enough. 

An hour after we had ordered, we were still waiting for the grilled Salmon Kama. We were sure they were preparing it since we had checked with the waitress and she had previously mentioned that it was coming. But to our surprise, 15 minutes after the fried cheese had come out, the waitress gave us the bill. We were surprised and disappointed with the disorganization and rudeness of the service. Never mind not getting the Salmon Kama, we hadn't even asked for the bill. And with empty tables everywhere around us, we were wondering why they were in such a hurry to make us leave.

The staff were confused and were sure they had served us the Salmon Kama. But when we insisted we never got it, she ran over to a neighbouring table and looked at what they had been served. Although she never said it, we suspect that they had mistakenly given our order to another table. 

FIrst and last time we will ever step into this establishment. If you have lived in Toronto for a wee bit of time, or have done your research, you know there are tens of (actually authentic) Japanese restaurants at the same price level that will out-do Ichiriki by light years. So so so disappointing, especially after reading all the positive reviews. 

The verdict - Ichiriki is a gimmick and preys on customers who think they are getting the authentic Japanese experience because this establishment is Japanese run. You pay for the 'upscale' environment and jazz music and the illusion that this is the real stuff. For the same price, go to Japango."}
{"text":"Ichiriki is a NICE restaurant, suitable for a date night with Yorkville prices to impress $$$. Quite authentic, the head itamae is Japanese and they have jazz nights as well. 

The food itself is quite par, with expensive ingredients (triple A striploin for beef teriyaki) that don't really justify or hitting the market target. So the prices I find exuberant. The restaurant also closes extremely early (9 PM). 

What is really noteworthy are the desserts. Strong mango pudding and green tea pudding game but I also heard the puffs were amazing. Guess what, you can get takeout dessert too! 

I recommend a try but return for the desserts!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for sushi when I am downtown. Very good quality (with flavour!) but not inexpensive. This is all good in my book.

Busy at lunch, less so at dinner. 

As mentioned the take away is a steal. 1/2 - 2/3 the price!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality. Had the chirashi, which is priced at a premium compared to other places. The only good thing was that the sushi rice was very good, but the sashimi was not very fresh and I got pieces of three very common varieties of fish, and just one piece of the fourth variety, along with other comonly found elements of chirashi (one sliver of avocado, a shrimp, the egg, kani). Very skimpy. 
Miso soup was good, but the salad was just a pile of iceberg lettuce with dressing, no other type of veggies could be found... Overall, very disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my Japanese friends told me good things about this restaurant, and I had been curious to try their food for a while.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. Two of us were here and we shared Tempura dinner and Chirashi Sushi. Their tempura was crispy and tasty, but nothing spectacular about it. However, their Chirashi Sushi was very good. Sashimi on the rice was fresh and nicely presented, the rice seasoning was fantastic.  

I would definitely come back to this restaurant to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Slow and overpriced. From walking in the door to being served my order, the time was 45 minutes. It was not even busy, they were just slow. Then I was charged more than what the prices are on the menu. Terrible experience, I will never go again."}
{"text":"This is not a high end sushi place,  which you would expect on Bloor Street with Tiffany's a few doors down the block,  but it's a great lunch spot.   The decor is lacking here,  and looks more like a fast food Chinese restaurant that a sushi house.   That should not detract you from coming here though.   The service is quick,  and the sushi is fresh & presentable.   The food is well priced for the area as well.   If would definitely come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"Been here three times and it's a small Japanese owned establishment which is heartwarming in such a chain-ridden neighborhood, but Ive also had better. First visit was a fail because my partner and I wanted sushi but it was a Soba Tuesday. On our third visit we got free edamame as an appetizer. Fish is definitely fresh; and they offer fresh uni (sea urchin). What sets their menu apart from other sushi joints in yorkville are their grilled salt-covered meat or fish dishes (forget teriyaki sauce), which is common feature in Japanese cuisine but just doesn't seem to appear often on menus over here. We had the grilled black cod and it came out super tender and not one bit fishy. Their chicken karage was chewy and savoury. I didn't mind that it was smaller in unit size than what I've had before, or that they only used dark meat, but appeared to be fried with old oil or for just a bit too long. (The outside was a darker golden brown) I've also had mediocre experiences with their tempura. Their sushi is definitely a step up from the AYCE joints though also pricier. I don't mind revisiting whenever I have a sushi craving as I live a minute away from the restaurant, but if I were you I'd try any dish you hadn't had before and you might be pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"Food was quite good - but the whole experience was overshadowed by the horrible service. We had to remind them of part of our order as well as go up to the desk to pick up our bill since it was apparent that the servers (there were 3) were neither paying attention to is nor would they (we tried to get their attention several times). I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I now work nearby Ichiriki and decided to try it out.  Make sure to come before 12pm as it fills up quickly.  Being in an office area, they have learned to serve busy professionals in an efficient manner.  They have a decent selection for their lunch specials and varies from $15 (daily special) to $20 before taxes and tip. It is on the high end, but I thought it was well worth it. The bento boxes were a good size, the sushi was well prepared and cooked part of the box was tasty (tempura and beef). The one issue that rubbed me the wrong way is that they charge $1 for a bowl of rice. At an average price of $17.50 for lunch, I think rice should be included.  Especially if you order teriyaki chicken or beef, it is very saucy and needs rice to complement it."}
{"text":"This place is great when you're in a rush and on the go.  They have a great lunch menu with discounted prices from their dinner menu.  The selection is pretty decent and I'm a fan of their bento boxes in particular.

The service is quick and for take out, you're usually not waiting for more than 10-15 minutes for your food.  The sushi is also pretty decent and the sashimi is pretty fresh.  One of the better sushi restaurants around yonge/bloor.

Keep in mind the sushi is made the authentic way, so the wasabi is rolled into the sushi when made.  Not a bad spot for Japanese downtown!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Toronto. It's a small boutique restaurant tucked into the side of Bloor St,  with a charming inside atmosphere that tells you this is an authentic Japanese place. The chef is really good at what he does and if you sit at the sushi bar, he will not hesitate to make pleasant conversation with you. The fish he gets is shipped in fresh from Japan, and you can really taste it in the sushi. The fish is meaty but delicate, the rice is made to perfection. The uni, bbq eel, hamachi and toro here are among the best I've ever had. If you don't mind spending a little more $ for some high quality sushi, Ichi Riki is definitely one place I'd recommend."}
{"text":"A very convenient location situated just on the north-east corner of Yonge & Bloor. This nice little boutique restaurant is quite visible thanks to a standing sign that says \"Ichiriki sushi restaurant\".

The service in this restaurant is quick. I ordered a salmon and sashimi dish, with steam rice for an extra dollar. The portions are surprisingly huge. On my dish, there are three pieces of sashimi, three pieces of sushi roll, garden salad on the side, two large pieces of salmon and a small dish of tuna salad. The tuna salad mini-dish was refreshing and tasty. The sushi has wasabi inside, which is prepared the correct authentic way. 

The setting of the restaurant is suitable for a jazz band, as there are many jazz photos posted on the wall. I was told by the waitress that jazz nights take place in the restaurant on the weekends. I would raise an extra star rating if I come here one night for their jazz performance."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant japonais, mais il faut arriver tôt sur l'heure du midi car il se remplit vite.
Le menu du jour est généralement un succès
La soupe miso est excellente
Un must try! :)"}
{"text":"Ichiriki can be a bit hard to spot being nestled in amongst the grey slather of office buildings near Church and Bloor but it is well worth searching out as it serves dependable, honest Japanese cuisine. 

The room itself is cozy, quiet and calm, decorated with tones of dark blue and pictures of local jazz artists on one wall. I take it the owner must be a fan of jazz as it was constantly streaming in the background.

Sashimi here is fresh and of good quality, I had the 15 piece plate and there was a good selection in there for 22 bucks. Ichiriki's sushi and sashimi is probably up there for high quality sushi downtown unless you feel like taking a trip out to Scarborough or have the $ to blow at Kaji or Hiro. Menu also has a number of Japanese classics such as donburi, udon, teriyaki and some Japanese appetizer dishes. 

Service is sweet and observant, you even get a complimentary bowl of ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Dined with three friends - the restaurant was close to our hotel. The shared gyoza were burned, but otherwise nearly tasteless. The charred theme continued into the meal one of my friends had (the beef in his sushi and beef maki combo). My spicy tuna roll was fine - not spectacular, not terrible - but I was disappointed by the seaweed salad (though it was visually rather pretty, with different seaweeds). We were startled that last call was just before 9 PM, and the place shuts down pretty early. Our waitress was nice, but communication was difficult at times. None of us were particularly happy with our meals. With so many other restaurant options in this area, I'd recommend looking elsewhere if you're in the mood for Japanese food."}
{"text":"A little overpriced but the Sashimi slices are very thick. Recommendations are suggested. I arrived on a Thursday night at 7:45pm and the whole place was full. I have to wait 30 min for a table for 3. If I had known, I would have made a reservation. The staff were nice about making us wait though. We also had the mango cheesecake for dessert which was very good and tasted fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"Quiet, little Japanese restaurant, with a family-run feel to it. A little more expensive than what I am normally used to (AYCE), but the quality and portions are significantly larger.

A must do recommendation. 

A little saddened I was unable to request for ice cream instead of rice as my side though, but other than that, I do look forward to coming here yet again."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Japanese food. The seafood nabeyaki udon was delicious -- the fish, shrimp and scallops were so tasty. Their rolls are also very good. I'm very impressed by the quality of the food here!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ichiriki for nearly seventeen years.  Shortly after it opened.  I've been dozens of times, although less so in more recent years because I moved out of the neighbourhood.  I always told people that it's the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto.  In a lot of ways it still is.

Here's the problem.  Yonge and Bloor has seen a huge influx of condo owners in recent years.  The new 75 story tower on the southeast corner is just starting to fill up.  As a result Ichiriki has gone from being busy/lively to a mob scene.

I would argue there's no sushi chef in Toronto who works harder than Riki-san.  But based on my recent dinner, there's no question that the workload has become too much for any one person to handle.  My husband and I always sit at the sushi bar and let Riki-san serve us whatever he likes.  Always wonderful.  And the quality of the sushi on my recent visit was excellent as usual.  The problem was that the sushi was slow in coming, small in the number of pieces and overpriced.  Over the course of the meal we each got seven pieces of sushi and three small California rolls.  The cost?  An even hundred dollars.

In the end the bill after drinks, taxes and tip was over $180.  And we left the restaurant still a bit hungry.  Would we have liked more?  Yes.  Did anyone care to ask?  No.  But I wouldn't say that Riki-san or the staff were lazy or neglectful.  On the contrary.  Riki-san was basically a tornado of activity.  He was dealing with an ever growing stack of orders piling up.  He simply didn't have time to serve us more or to even check to see if we wanted more.

What's the solution?  Perhaps more than one sushi chef.  Ichiriki will never again achieve the level of excellence in terms of service if the staff has to deal with the thirty takeout orders coming in from the hungry condo owners.  In the end it was my first disappointing visit to Ichiriki.  A negative review from one of Ichiriki's most loyal customers won't do them any harm.  Business is too booming to even notice.  Which is good news for Ichiriki.  But bad news for its most loyal customers."}
{"text":"Today is Valentines Day so we called in advance for reservation. There were still a lot of available tables when we arrived. We ordered 15 pieces of sashimi ($35), one dynamite roll ($10), one negi-toro roll (fatty tuna, $11), and two pieces of uni sushi ($10). The taste was great for its price. The uni is very fresh as they ship it from Vancouver every other day.

I also like the cozy atmosphere in the restaurant. You can tell the chef Riki really likes jazz music from the background music in the restaurant, the tiny cello model from the bar, and the autograph from a cellist. 

Overall, this is a good place to hang out with friends and the quality of food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was good, a little bit on the pricier side. Came for the $15 lunch special which is a good amount of food. Service is good, but it is small and can get pretty busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"Ichi Riki is our favorite Japanese restaurant. The food is fresh and high quality, the service is friendly and hospitable. No fast food or service here, it is an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the lunch-hour style places that serves decent Japanese fare.  Seating is a bit cramped. Saki selection is decent."}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant in the Bloor and Church area. Been coming here since the first opened years ago.

Food has always been good and fresh. However, if you are here for lunch, it will take an hour and make sure you come a few minutes earlier otherwise it may be a long wait as it is small inside!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sashimi - some of the best this side of the Tokyo Fish Market restaurants (without the nearly 1 hour wait at those microscopic bars). I have followed Riki since  he was at Sushi Man on Richmond. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've patronised this place since it opened around 2002 and it still serves the most authentic Japanese food - great service and value.

Many Japanese restaurants in Toronto are opened by Chinese but Ichi Riki is the real deal and frequented by Japanese themselves who prefer to share the dishes versus North American's who order for themselves.

The dishes are simple and use authentic ingredients (japanese rice, tempura batter) versus the Chinese-owned restaurants. There  are only 3 real Japanese restaurants worth going to in Toronto and Ichi Riki is one."}
{"text":"Conveniently located minutes away from Bloor/Yonge Station, I happen to stumble upon this establishment on the way home. The location is not car-friendly as parking is hard to come by; however, for the TTC riders and individuals who work in the area, the location is perfect. My review is based on my experiences having lunch at Ichiriki. It looks like there is some sort of jazz event in the evenings, but as I have yet to attend, I cannot comment on it.

Pros:
* Japanese run ..... yes, this is the age old debate. I will only eat at a J-resto run by Japanese.
* Location, location, location ... a 5 min. walk from Bloor/Yonge Station cannot be beat.
* Reasonable prices
* Lunch sets
* Good service
* Tonkatsu

Cons:
* Parking ... maybe this is a sign that I shouldn't be so reliant on my car
* Donburi ... avoid it at all costs; you finish your rice in 3 spoon servings
* Small = limited number of seats"}
{"text":"Lunch is good value for the quality.  There are 2 prepared lunch takeout options by the cash.

Dinner is a bit pricey, but that is offset by free ice cream.  I love the ginger one, which has pieces of candied ginger.  Other flavours offered have included green tea & red bean.

The fish has always been fresh, but my favourite menu item is the urajiro, tempura of shitake mushrooms with shrimp paste.

Portions are on the small side and the menu is not extensive.  Nice ambience.  If I recall correctly, lunch is served Tue to Fri and dinner Wed to Sat.

[Based on 6+ visits for lunch & 3 visits for dinner]"}
{"text":"Sushi in the city is abundant, but good sushi is hard to find.  Ichiriki is good, but not abundant and they can be a bit pricy, they you have to realize that they are on the out skirts of Yorkville and do offer a good quality of sushi.

I found this place, as I work right across the street and was taken here for a lunch by a co-worker.  I ordered a bento box and asked to make all of the sushi items crab.  Little did I realize that it was a $1 charge per change!!  My $15 meal went up to $20!  I was in shock to say the least, but I learned my lesson, and the chef's selection really isn't bad - but since it was my first time there I wasn't taking any chances.

We have since gone back many time and the food is consistent and yummy.  I have even taken their bento box to go and it comes with a LOT of food.  The staff on the other hand are not the sharpest tools in the shed.  It can take them up to 5 mins to get your drink order and even longer to get your bill.

This place gets busy at lunch, so if you are going with a larger group - call a dead to make a reso, and by larger I mean anything over 3 ppl.

Check it out if you're in the area and are craving sushi."}
{"text":"What I can say is that this place is QUICK if you want sushi on the go.

I stopped in to pick up a Bento box and was out in under a minute. For $11.00 it was OK and well worth it if you are business person on the go and need to pick up a quick lunch.

Worthwhile. DO IT."}
{"text":"It's over-priced, but if you know fish, you know this is a high-end place.
If you like rolls, this is not the place for you, if you like sauces that other places smother their rolls and sushi with, this is not your place. 

This place is specifically for people who know the fine difference between good fish and very good fish.

Only if the price was a bit lower, I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch usually, and I find that their lunch specials (if you make it in time before they sell out) are pretty worth it!! The sashimi here is especially fresh, and the lunch combo comes with salad, soup, rice, some dish of the day, crab rolls, and sushi+sashimi!! The other lunch specials with no sushi (the teriyaki salmon,chicken etc. with rice) is a pretty big portion which also comes with soup and salad, and those are around 10-15$. 
Other than the specials, the regular menu is on the pricy side. With chirashi being around $18, and sashimi sets being more. But like I said, they have really fresh tasting sashimi so it makes sense they charge more :)"}
{"text":"Checked out Ichiriki for lunch today with a few coworkers and I was not impressed.  Once seated, it took about 10-15 min. before the waitress came back to take our order.  

Our meals (2 lunch specials - $13 and the tempura shrimp lunch set - $11) took a long time to arrive, almost 25 minutes which I think for lunch downtown on a weekday is a bit ridiculous.  

I found the tempura to be extremely heavy and oily. It left a very unpleasant greasy coating in my mouth which is just gross.  Plus they forgot my salad that was suppose to come with the meal.  

The lunch special was a mix bag of stuff - chicken fried rice, California rolls, 2 salmon pieces, salad, tempura shrimp and deep fried dumplings.  The folks who had the special seemed to like it but it didn't look that appetizing to me.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go blot the oil off my tongue."}
{"text":"Convenient location at Yonge/Blood with efficient staff. I found the food a bit pricey during lunch, but I think it's probably consistent with other places in the area. The restaurant is small-ish, so if you're coming in a bigger group, it's probably best to call ahead. I had a bento box, which comes with sushi. 

Fair warning: the chefs here prepare sushi the \"Japanese\" way (that's what I was told, anyway) with wasabi inside, so be prepared for that if you're not used to eating it or if you're used to only using a small bit."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto. I've visted it three times. 

I think its strong point is its fried food (Abura-mono) , compared to other Japanese restaurants in Toronto. You can read from their menu that they use egg yolk to make tempura, and will be soundly confirmed at first bite. Fried shrimp balls (not sure if it's the name) was also very tasty, so I guess all their fried food are best in Toronto.

Its sushi is also very classy, but expensive at the same time. For newbies like me, I would recommend you to try sushi at Ematei (if you want authentic ones).

Also recommended is their daily special meal set. They kind of know what you need even if you don't.

Don't forget the Omakase course if you are treating someone (need reservation)."}
{"text":"Ichiriki Japanese Restaurant is crazily busy during lunch rush. I was lucky to be here right at 12:00 and grab that last seat at the sushi bar.

Kudo to the wait staff which was so efficient. The kitchen and the lone sushi chef though was overwhelmed with orders. If you expect a true Japanese restaurant experience, you might be disappointed. The goal here is to get people out as fast as possible so they can go back to work during lunch.

Their $15 daily lunch special is good deal if you want to have a taste of everything. They also have other lunch bento set available.

Food was ok. Price is reasonable. 

Dinner experience might be totally different but the price though is a lot more.

Watching Sushi Chef going crazy with the waitress just dumping orders in front of him was quite entertaining."}
{"text":"Nope. Expensive, flavourless, poorly wrapped. Two rolls cost me into $20 (for lunch)

PROS: Friendly servers

CONS: Nope food.


Better options in the area, I vote this a pass."}
