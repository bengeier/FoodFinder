{"text":"I had always wanted to go to Teatro my entire life yet somehow never ended up there. I guess I always had it built up to be something amazing but it wasn't something that blew me out of the water. Our service was good but it seemed almost a touch unprofessional as you would expect with a fancy restaurant. The food was good but not something I keep as a memory to rave about. The building is beautiful and the décor is stunning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not cheap but the food is amazing if your going to spend the money get the chefs tasting menu usually about 11 courses and each is amazing in presentation and taste.this is by far one of the best restaurants in calgary"}
{"text":"I love Steven Ave, it's my favorite spot in Calgary and Theatro happens to be on Steven Ave right next to the park in a beutiful old building. For the location alone I would give 3 stars, but the food is awesome and original and they have an excellent cocktail menu too. One of my favorite parts were the old pictures they had of downtown Calgary back in the early 1900. Very cool. If you're planning a date night this place is very romantic and after you can stroll Steven Ave or hit up many of its cocktail lounges and pubs."}
{"text":"Now, everyone else seems to rave about Teatro, and I'm going to go against the flow.  I feel it's my duty to stand up for all the people out there that don't get off on overtly classy, \"fancy for the sake of being fancy\" restaurants.  I enjoy good tasting food no matter what the setting - be it uber-chic or a total dive - but I felt Teatro just didn't deliver the tasty goods that the upscale décor promised. The setting of Teatro makes you feel like you're dining at Buckingham Palace with the queen - white linens and four-course place settings with multiple wine glasses for pairing with dishes - at lunch?  Are there really that many people out there that require this level of class during their noonhour?  I am obviously not part of this elite.   But alas, I did find myself dining at Teatro for lunch on one occasion.  Calamari Frito was ordered for the table by my dining acquaintance, and to be fair, it was pretty good.  The dipping sauce was a tasty housemade grape tomato ketchup (they've changed the menu and the accompanying sauce is a spicy mayo), but I do prefer it when places use only calamari rings and not the baby squid - I hate the idea of eating the poor little things whole.  For my main, I selected Lobster ravioli.  I expected that to be plural for the $25 pricetag, but when it arrived there was one lonely pasta square on my plate, sitting on a \"shazaam\" of roasted red pepper coulis.  The lobster inside was very fresh, but they did nothing with it, and why hide it inside a pocket of bland pasta with no sauce? - I scraped up every bit of that coulis underneath but it wasn't near enough.  I just didn't get it.  I'm sure the chef has a vision, we just didn't see eye to eye."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Teatro was was terribly dissapointed. For the prices you pay, the food should be excellent and the service should be even better. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case here.  The food itself was just alright. I didn't find it to be anything special, although I did enjoy the lemon dessert. What surprised me the most about Teatro was the service we received from our server, Adrian, who clearly didn't want to be there and was rude and dismissive for the duration of the night. His attitude made my boyfriend and I feel extremely uncomfortable on what was supposed to be an enjoyable celebratory birthday dinner. It certainly wasn't all the servers that were responding shortly and failing to pay attention to the restaurant patrons though. When we looked around, we noticed that all the other servers had smiles on their faces and were pleasant. Even the girl at the front was understanding when we explained our lack of a good night. So all in all, maybe we just had a negative experience because of our particular server. Regardless, I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"It was raining so we had to sit inside, otherwise it looked like they had a great seating area outdoors. The waitstaff was helpful in selecting menu items but for this type of place the service was a bit slow and the Wine Director was slow to retrieve bottles from the cellar. The food was tasty but the portions were small. I ordered the duck, and it was a unique take, but I would have expected larger portions. I ordered a scotch after dinner and for the price the pour was only 1 oz, not typical even for ordering it neat. The apps. were well prepared and the menu selection was great. I would go back to try their menu items again."}
{"text":"My Family went to Teatro to CELEBRATE my daughter's 15th bday and it was a SUPERB experience from food to service. They exceed my expectation."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The best high end dining in Calgary.  I've tried pretty much everywhere in the city, and these guys are the best.  Every time I try another fine dining place my gf and I always think 'why didn't we just go to Teatro instead?'.    The building itself is fantastic and the high back booths are perfect for dates.  The service is always impeccable.  Everything is absolutely top notch.  I could make a meal just of the bread.  Of course then I would miss out on the amazing entres!  And I highly recommend the Tasting of Creme Brulees.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I go to fine dining restaurant time to time to treat myself. I have been to numerous famous restaurants in NYC and other major cities. I have been to Michelin three star restaurants suh as Pierre Gagnaire, Per Se, Jean Georges to name a few. I have also been to two or one star ones like Jungsik, Aureole, BlackBird, etc.  That being said, I didn't expect my dining experience at Teatro to be as great as some of the Michelin three star restaurants I have been to. However, I was still looking forward to my dining experience here as I heard this restaurant has always been rated as one of the top three restaurants in Calgary. I am fairly new to Calgary, and I was more excited as this was the first fine dining restaurant I was trying out in the city.  I recently had the eight-course Chef-Tasting menu, which is priced at $135/person. Actually, if I include the sorbet, cheese dish, and fruit dessert that came before the actual dessert, I guess I had total of 11 dishes.  The service was good enough for me. What I wasn't satisfied was the actual food itself. In short, my overall experience of this restaurant was just so-so. None of the dish I had was bad, but most dishes were mediocre at best. There were about two dishes that were good, but nothing excellent or very good.  Because this restaurant is still a fine dining restaurant in Calgary, I guess they do try using some of the pricey ingredients like caviar and truffles, but the quality of these ingredients were not very impressive. This is especially true for truffles. They amount of the truffle that was on the dish was actually quite generous, but they barely tasted like actual good truffles.   Also, some of their dishes seemed to be bit salty, yet other dishes were bland and under-seasoned. By the way, their bread seemed to be quite salty as well.  Overall, I would rate this restaurant 2.5 at the best. Don't get me wrong. It wasn't bad, but I was disappointed because I was expecting something quite lot better after reading all the positive reviews and hypes about this restaurant. I really hope Teatro is not actually one of the best restaurants in Calgary. If it is, I guess there are just no good restaurants in Calgary.  Again, I didn't expect this restaurant to be as good as some of the Michelin three star restaurants, but I was expecting it to be at least somewhere near the level of Michelin one star restaurants in NYC and other cities in the States. After trying it out, I totally have to agree with Ardy down there who left a review before me. \"Teatro is not even close to the quality and flavor of a Michelin star restaurant.\", which is very true based on my fine dining experience. I would say even one star Michelin restaurants are so much better than Teatro in terms of taste.  I am also well aware that Michelin Stars aren't everything. In fact, I have also been to many non-Michelin star restaurants and have had excellent meals. Unfortunately, Teatro just wasn't good enough.   Maybe I will try other fine restaurants in Calgary, like Rouge. Hopefully I will have a better experience there, but I would be really disappointed if the other top fine dining restaurants in Calgary offer similar experience to that of Teatro."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.   Our server was amazing and thank you, thank you thank you, for the purse stool! haha    As for the meal, Rustiche alla Pomodoro and the Lobster Ravioli was delicious. Lamb dish was a little disappointing-a little too dry on the outside.   I have to admit that their wine list was pretty impressive and also expensive.  But do not despair, they had a great list (decent wines) for those who just wanted a glass to accompany their meal - I personally don't like to order a bottle for lunch and be drunk for the rest of the day.  I had a glass of one of their 2004 Bordeaux wines, from Haut-Medoc (I can't remember which Chateau it was from) and it was fantastic.        In general, their pasta dishes were impressive. I will definately go back to try the rest of their pasta and antipasti dishes (here I come Beef Tartare).     Teatro is definately not a diner, so expect to see a lot of business crowd and couples on their fancy dates."}
{"text":"I'd always wondered where Teatro was located and was pleasantly surprised to find it tucked away between the Telus Convention Center and the Olympic park. Getting here doesn't take me out my downtown core zone so I'm happy about that. Once inside, I found the decor arrangement a little confusing. The eating areas were arranged for a heightened feeling of privacy with a few nooks spread around which is always nice in a restaurant. However, I also found it dizzying watching the servers navigate the area.   I went in the middle of the Calgary stampede and they were not too busy for lunch at this time of the year. Service was friendly but could have been quicker especially when it's billed as an express lunch. I got my express lunch special ten to fifteen minutes after I placed my order. Prior to my first course showing up, a bread basket was offered and I tried the olive-infused baguette slice. I would have loved for it to be warmer. The food itself was good without being memorable.  Curiosity satisfied on this one, I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible service for a fine dining restaurant. The wait staff, Mike had no personality or consistency. He didn't even complete a quality check. He told us that he was sending over the sommelier, instead sent over the bartender. He didn't clean our table between courses, or provide us with something to clean our palates. The sad part was is that he seemed to be providing the other patrons with a higher level of service. Overall, the food and the service aren't worth the money. The actual building is beautiful...Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Unless Teatro is the Italian word for \"mushroom\" I don't get it.  Beautiful atmosphere, amazing staff and a menu that only seems to exist for the sake of being trendy.  Small portions (but beautifully presented), high prices and a general feeling of \"meh\".  Normally I want everything on the menu, here I was hard pressed to find something that didnt have mushrooms (as you can guess I hate them) and sounded somewhat appetizing. They gentleman at the table next to us joked about stopping at A&W on the way back to work.  I won't go back, but I think my wife and her friends would enjoy it."}
{"text":"We were greeted by incredibly warm and welcoming staff who even took our coats for us and hung them up. The service was probably the best I have ever had in Alberta so far. Food was delivious although I have to admit I have had more flavourful italian food but it was still great. The portion sizes were just right and the tiramisu was my favourite! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We picked Teatro for New Years Eve dinner and were completely disappointed.  They went with a 4 course tasting menu where the 4 courses cost about 50% more than they would on the normal menu.   I had chicken broth, mini caprese salad, beef tenderloin and teramesu.  This cost $120!  Add a martini, manhattan and a beer and the bill exceeded $300.  I was doubly disappointed as this place was hyped as a top pick.  Not so unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went to Teatro's for their express lunch special - 3 courses (+ bread!)  It was awesome. The gentleman I was meeting and I were both in a rush but the food was brought to the table quickly and even better, it was delicious! I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Seafood a little salty Seemed a little faulty Duck was great I couldn't wait Pineapple panna cotta was amazing Everything was really great and I'd come back Staff were receptive to feedback Which we really appreciated.  Wine pairings - Bourgogne Blanc 2011 and Pinot Noir by the glass"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Here's my experience with Teatro:  When we walked in the door: the decor was very nice. Main seating area was half empty, yet they seated us at the corner of the restaurant. We ended up asking to change our table to the main dining area.  Pre-appetizer on the house: a tiny bite sized (1cm x 1cm) bruchetta sample, one per person. If you are so stingy about a free sample, I'd rather not have it. If you want people to actually taste it, at least give me 1/4 of a normal bread size.  Bread: Nothing special. And I like it with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, not olive oil with salt. Just personal preference.  Appetizer: Tomato tart. Nicely done, pretty small for $18 though. Tasted pretty good, but the vinegar on the plate stood out more than the tart itself.  Main: Ragotoni (Rabbit meat + pasta): WAY TOO SALTY. I couldn't eat it. Pasta was a little undercooked for my taste. My fiance ended up having most of it. Aside from that, rabbit tasted just like pork, the sausage was ok.  Second Main: Lamb leg: Sauce was pretty good, overall very heavily tasted. There were 2 lamb steaks and one lamb sausage; one of the steaks they threw in a big chunk of pure lamb fat with the meat (not the nicely fat veins in the meat, but a 1 inch fat layer), I wouldn't suggest anyone to eat that unless you want to clog arteries. Might as well throw in a bone on my plate. (Speaking of bones, I did find a bone in the pasta)  Dessert: Hazelnut tart with banana ice cream: Sounds good right? Hazelnut and banana is pretty much the fail safe combo. WRONG!! Just how can you mess that up?! The ice cream ended up masking everything else on the plate, the pastry has no taste, the sugar paste in the tart was very chewy. If I could eat them separately, I'd leave out the sugar paste and the tart, and keep the banana ice cream with hazelnuts.  Service: Nothing spectacular. Not too bad. One thing I absolute hate: When I (or my fiance) said thank you, I expected a \"You are welcome\". Don't ignore me because I said thank you every time he refilled my water or took our empty plates. Is that so much work to say 3 words??  Washrooms: They are located downstairs. The staircase is pretty much for one person at a time. I can't imagine how people with disability would go down those stairs.  One more thing: As we were done our meal (before dessert), the server came by, without saying a word, stuck his left hand to his back, did something that looked like either he was scratching his ass or un-doing a wedgie for about 5 seconds, then took out a ruler looking thing to clean up the crumbs on the table. That was pretty cool except it took him 5 full seconds to search for that thing from his butt.  I don't recommend this place. I'm going for 2 more times ONLY BECAUSE I have vouchers that I've already paid for. This restaurant is banned from my list after that.  I will try the calamari next time coz it looked pretty good and there are some good reviews about it, definitely will try other dishes!"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in I knew we would have a special anniversary night. I'm not sure why we waited so long to dine at Teatro but now I just can't stop thinking about the meal we enjoyed there. First I really want to say that this place is gorgeous! It used to be an old bank and there are several architectural features remaining from days gone by, like the large pillars and archways above the bar area. The tables are not set too close together, allowing for a bit of privacy whether you're on your first date or your 19th anniversary... But that kitchen! Wow, it's a stunner. There are an Italian white marble pass and gorgeous copper fume hood running almost the entire length of the kitchen.  Service was excellent from the coat check, to the purse stool provided as well as impeccable timing and personality. Now for the food. I could have just sat there and ate the house bread and olive oil all night. It was that good.  We ordered the Beef Tartare and Caprese salad to start. I thought it was nice that the tartare came preportioned on top of little potato crisps so we didn't have to worry about filling up on more bread. The tomatoes in the caprese were quite nice though I didn't think the micro basil had enough flavour on it's own. Maybe add a basil pistou? For our mains I ordered the Dungeness Crab Risotto and was quite happy with all the chunks of crab involved. I didn't like the dehydrated cauliflower because I'm not really a cauliflower fan at the best of times. Hubby ordered the Agnolotti Al Plin and loved every bit of it. The pork ragu was so rich and the preserved egg yolk was a neat way to get that cheese flavour without adding cheese.  Since it was a special occasion we decided to order dessert and cappuccinos. Hubby had the house specialty Tiramisiu which I think is quite popular..I saw more than a few of them being ordered throughout our stay. I went with the Rose water Creme Brulée. I thought it was a really great idea to serve it in such a shallow dish because that way the torching warms up the entire custard. It was delicious!  We have a theatre subscription again this year and I'm hoping we can visit Teatro again on one of our theatre evenings."}
{"text":"This was the second time that we experienced Teatro and it will be the last.  The problem with this restaurant is consistency. First, we triggered the sommelier and we asked to split a glass of wine to pair with our starters.  Instead of bringing us each a taste, he pours us a glass each (and charged us).  My wife and I ordered 2 courses each and the first course were a good start.  The oysters on the half shelf were amazing and the panzanella salad was beautiful.  Wonderful textures, flavors and presentations.  The mains were a disaster, I ordered the Seared Giant Scallop with grilled chorizo, soft polenta, arugula pesto, caponata crostini.  The presentation was an absolute disaster (polenta looked like smeared baby food) and the only thing that saved the dish was that the flavors worked well together.  My wife ordered the seafood special, which was seared Halibut over asparagus and curried beet compote. The halibut was overcooked, and the waitress neglected to inform my wife that the compote was very, very spicy.  The night was capped by a $14 tiramisu, which was good but not 14 bucks good.    There will be no return, there will be no 3rd chance for Teatro or its staff.  I'd like Gordon Ramsay to pay these guys a visit and get the cobwebs shaken out of this institution. For the prices they are demanding, there is no room for the mistakes they seem to make again and again.  Also, having a waitress wearing a shirt that is two sizes too small looks absolutely unprofessional.  I mean, seriously....this is indicative of fine dining in Calgary?  C'mon."}
{"text":"Teatro is a grand and impressive restaurant in a true European Style. At first glance, it may look like a pretentious place. But I do not get the feeling that it is. It's in an old historic bank building downtown, with high ceilings, majestic classical columns, and a gracious ambience designed for fine evening dining, with dinner jackets, port and cigars. (Pity we cannot indulge in these aromatic smoking pleasures any more!)   I cannot help but relive my colonial past when I enter this restaurant. The service is always superb. The servers know their stuff and know how to romance the menu. They also know how to correctly serve a bottle or glass of wine!   The quality of food and service is consistently exceptional and impeccable. They have an impressive and expensive wine list. While I've been there for lunch, and after work drinks, it's really the kind of place that you want to visit at night for a special anniversary dinner or with special friends.   Well Worth a Visit. I'm tempted to give them an extra star for the wonderful space they are in....it's simply fabulous. But there may be some local Cow Boys who may feel intimated by the white tablecloths and white napkin service..."}
{"text":"Made a reservation prior to our show as the theatre is across the street. Teatro has always been fine in the past. However, tonight marks the first time in history I have ever walked out of a Resteraunt shaking my head in disbelief.  Firstly let's understand that we are great customers at any Resteraunt as we tend to eat out most week nights do to our crazy office hours. Let's also keep in mind that when it comes to great dining money is no object and we typically prefer non franchise higher end establishments.  So here is the deal. I have a rule and it is quite simple. Charge me what ever you want for your food but it better be darn good if you are tipping the high end of the scale.  So they have this $55 prime rib and it comes with some cheesy potato and green salad. I noticed that they had mashed potatoes on another dish (think it was pork). So the long story made short I was going to order a pasta dish $32ish and my prime rib as I was kind of craving pasta to start my meal.  While ordering the waitress said that they would not give me mashed potatoes instead of the potatoes and salad it came with.  So let's get this straight, I spend $87 for a meal and you won't make the effort to insure I am happy with my order?  Should I have to order a meal that I don't want (pork) just to have to mashed potatoes?  Perhaps putting one type of potato on a plate versus another can be a complex endeavour or perhaps our waitress was just too lazy to accommodate a simple change.  Heck, charge me even more if you want! Instead I just got a snotty NO they won't do that.   It was not so much the mashed potatoes as the attitude and the lack of care to accommodate a guest. I must say that it is too bad because I really don't mind this place and perhaps this is just the case of crappy staff. That being said the manager made no effort to rectify the situation when we got up to leave. None the less we walked across the street and spent our $200 at Centini.   Calgary has lots of great places to eat and these days many of them are not seeing the business they were seeing when the economy was better a few years ago. I prefer to give my money to those that appreciate our business. Snotty lazy and rude service is never acceptable to us."}
{"text":"Great food. Waiter was attentive and personable - just right friendly without being overbearing. Appreciated the wine recommendations. Quick service. Went for Big Taste Gourmet tasting menu and enjoyed everything - the pasta with duck confit & wild mushrooms and the pork belly were especially excellent. (Cod was a little bland but still enjoyable.) Was puzzled as to why their \"wine pairings\" for the menu were the cheapest swill available when they could have easily upselled much much better wine with the Big Taste menu. Yeah it was cheap, but who goes to Teatro for a \"deal\"? Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a beautiful decor where the staff deliver an upscale service while still keeping it casual enough to fully enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The first thought that comes to mind when I think Teatro is fine dining - that's definitely what they're known for!  Although it may be pricy, you are paying for an experience of top notch ingredients, phenomenal service and gorgeous atmosphere.  Here you get to take the time to really appreciate their food and enjoy your time here (if you're in a rush, this is not the place to dine!)  I shared the arctic char, duck breast con l'olivia and the mango lemon panacotta the last time I was here and all the dishes were amazing. The portions are a bit smaller than I'm used to, but the richness of the food makes up for what volume I think I'm missing."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've never had a desire to visit Teatro. The reason is simple, I had this strange stereotype of it being an up-scale restaurant that charged the wealthy and executives a high premium for food you can get elsewhere for about half the price. As luck would have it, these are the days where my ridiculous stereotypes and insecurities have been bursting all around me forcing me to confront the reality of things. The bottom line is Teatro is an excellent establishment who's food is on par with its atmosphere. And for that it's going to cost you ... but not as much as you think ... for lunch.  I ordered the Rotisserie Free Range Sunworks Farms Chicken with fries and tomato insalata because it was really the only thing I could afford. Just kidding! The chicken was a very reasonable lunch time price of $16. I suppose at this point I could barrage you with adjectives such as succulent, juicy, tender and well ... jealous (because I could never make something close to this), but I will spare you. Save to say, it was excellent. However, the fries were a little over done.  Inside, with the vaulted ceiling, the clearly affluent clientèle and a very competent, professional and extremely attractive serving staff, it felt almost Hollywood-esque. I felt like a fish out of water the whole time!  If you want to impress someone, take them here!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious birthday celebration dinner at Teatro.  The service was stellar, and the food was awesome.  I was surprised at how bright and grand the main dining area is - for some reason from the outside it looks like it would be darker on the inside.  The big windows and tall ceilings made the ambiance a lot more modern than I was expecting.  We started with the Calamari, based on Joel K.'s positive review.  It really was the crispiest calamari I've ever had!  It was served with a korean chili aioli dipping sauce which went perfectly... just enough spice without being overwhelming.  Mike had the rack of lamb, which he declared was cooked perfectly.  He particularly enjoyed the polenta served on the side - fried crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside.  He even commented on how perfectly cooked the asparagus was.  I had the Pacific Halibut which was really moist and flavorful.  It was served with 'crispy potato' which were essentially really thin spiral-cut french fries.  The potato sat on top of a rich, creamy cauliflower puree.  The dish was extremely decadent, and my only complaint was that it was maybe a little *too* rich... perhaps I should have had the foresight to order one of the veggie sides.  Oh well!  Instead, we had ordered a side of risotto.  It was delicious!!  The serving size was much larger than I was expecting, and could have easily fed 3-4 people as a side dish.  Perhaps I needed a smaller serving of it due to the already rich nature of my meal selection.  The prices are on-par with the fancier restaurants in town.  You can't afford to eat here everyday, but it was a lot of fun to dine here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I've lived in Calgary for almost 20 years and only as of recent have I finally stepped into the lovely Teatro.   I'm not one who usually choosing fine dinning as I like to eat a decent portion of food, especially at dinner. Normally fine dinning charges high prices for barely anything on your plate.   Well, I was pleasantly surprised by the perfect amount of servings for this place. I enjoyed a salad to start, that was not some small side plate like most places. But it wasn't over portioned either.  Then I enjoyed the perfectly cooked rotisserie half chicken. I was nervous to read \"half chicken\" and expect too much for this plate. But again, perfect. And every side and taste added to this dish was fabulous. I even had room for desert, which I never really go for. This apple crust desert though... was beautiful and so delectably good!   My added favourite is the side table they provide for your purse. True Italian style. As I learnt that it's bad luck to put your bag on the floor in Italy."}
{"text":"The inside has great ambience and is a neat building. The service wasn't what you would expect, our waitress was efficient but abrupt and very emotionless service. Waitress was not engaging but almost as if a robot was serving. For an appetizer we shared the calamari which was very bland. The lasagna was also lacking in flavour. It was covered with a tomato sauce and topped with a scallop. Our last item was the Lamb which was ordered medium rare but came out rare, this even lacked in flavour. Was a disappointing experience unfortunately. Maybe this was a one off night and steps were missed to taste the sauces and food and maybe our waitress was having a bad night that left her checked out. Left and went somewhere else for desert"}
{"text":"Reservations for 6 adults for a business meeting over dinner on a Wednesday night. Sure, why not right?  We were seated to our table within 5 minutes of arriving. We were shown where the coat room was and I thought it would have been a nicer touch if the hostess offered to take our coats, but she didn't? You usually expect that in a restaurant that is fine dining to take your coat. Didn't want to let this spoil it, so didn't let it. Minor negative.  Our waiter was great, wish I got his name since he was funny and very friendly.  I want to say I think his name was Miles.  We ordered a couple bottles of wine to start, after all it is 6 adults. Plus a few beers by some of the men. While we waited, we decided on a couple appetizers. We ordered Calamari and Beef Carpaccio to share while we sipped some wine + beers.  The appetizers were good however not everyone at our table agreed. 4 of us thought they were good, 1 thought they were great and 1 thought they were bland and better at other places that were casual dining. Mixed review but to be fair, they were good - not great.  For dinner: 3 of us had the prime rib, 2 of us had the special which was scallops and 1 had the seafood lasagna. When dinner arrived we all had a taste of each other's so we could decide who had the best entree. The prime rib was nothing that made me say wow, but was still good. No complaints. The scallops were really disappointing. It was the special that night and only arrived with 6 scallops on the plate with some sort of shredded veggie? Obviously after eating it, you were still very hungry. I was one of the ones who ordered the Scallops - Boooo. The best entree had to be the seafood lasagne, I regret not getting that since it was so good and hardy too. Why I did'nt, I have no idea?   For the prices you pay in this place, you would expect the food to be Steller however it was good and okay in most instances. Nothing that would warrant, \"wow, those 6 scallops were so good it was worth $44.00\"  or \"wow, that prime rib was cooked perfect for $42 and awesome to have\". Defiantly not.  Only two people ordered dessert, which was Tiramisu and some beet cake. We all had a nibble and both were good. We also all had coffee and that was good as well. No complaints.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and open. So noise does travel and at times was a bit loud. I would come back again to give them another chance, maybe for lunch or a drink however not sure about dinner? It was a very expensive business dinner for food that was just good/okay.  There menu does change often and maybe worth checking out again if I am not paying. Keyword - IF I AM NOT PAYING!!!!!!  The service from our waiter deserves 5 stars however the food and the whole \"check your own coat\" thing would be about 2.5-3 stars.  Sorry Teatro, would have loved to give you 5 stars since I had high expectations."}
{"text":"Very good, didnt feel rushed at all. Waiter was extremely polite. Had the seafood lasagna and beef tenderloin, both were excellent. Definite recommendation from before I was veggie."}
{"text":"Teatro is easily one of the best fine dining restaurants in Calgary. We had an anniversary dinner here last night and the experience was every bit as amazing as our first time. They went above and beyond every step of the way.  Since it was a Sunday, we took our own bottle of wine - its BYOW (free Corkage) on Sunday nights. This is a HUGE perk for a high-end restaurant such as Teatro, so do take advantage of it if you are thinking of going on a Sunday night. We happened to have the same waiter as the last time we were there, so that was a nice surprise.   My fiance and I were SPOILED at Teatro last night. We were first served bread and olive oil, both of which were delicious. Our waiter - Adrian - expertly explained every single detail to us about any menu item we inquired about. We ordered two appetizers to start - mushroom carpaccio and beef tartare. The mushroom carpaccio was an okay dish, and the beef tartare was delicious. It was served with some sort of crisps, thinly sliced pickles, and a creamy sauce and pickled caviar-type drops. Amazing.  Once we were done the appetizers and bread, Adrian our waiter brought us a small pasta course of lobster tortellini with lemon foam on top - on the house. We were pleasantly surprised. The 4 pieces of tortellini was huge, meaty, and substantial. The lemon foam was a nice touch.  For our mains, we ordered the seafood lasagna and quail. We chose a side of 'cauliflower risotto' off the menu, and the waiter suggested the mushroom risotto instead. \"But we don't see it listed on the menu\", we said. Adrian assured us not to worry about the menu, and if that is what we wanted, then that is what he will bring us. We agreed on the mushroom risotto, because it sounded like a winner.  When the food came, every single of the dishes exceeded our expectations. The seafood lasagne was creamy, abundant with lobster, shrimp, and scallop. My quail was amazing - crispy quail pieces sitting on top of soft pieces of pulled quail thighs, which was sitting on top of celeriac puree and root vegetables. Adrian drizzled the whole thing with foie gras jus infront of us. The dish was magnificent to say the least. I was already quite full after the tortellini, but the quail was so good I ate it up at lightning speed. The mushroom risotto - AMAZING. Thick, creamy, flavourful, PERFECT. And topped with thinly sliced truffle.   The portions were so generous, I knew we could not finish it all. So, we reluctantly asked if it 'was possible' to take the mushroom risotto to go. I know, I know.. asking for a doggy-bag at a Teatro? Ridiculous! But Adrian made it seem completely normal and said \"Everything is possible\" and whisked the risotto away.   I was too full to order dessert, but my fiance insisted on it. So we pondered over the dessert menu, wondering whether to order the Tiramisu, or the BC Quince with pear sorbet. Adrian our waiter described both to us and said they were both very good. We settled on the tiramisu, to share because we were very full. When Adrian brought out the tiramisu, to our surprise, he had also brought us the BC QUince and sorbet dessert - on the house! He said tasting the BC Quince dessert would be better than trying to visualize it with his descriptions.  Once again, we indulged. The tiramisu was great. A tad heavy, but that was because we were already stuffed. The BC Quince and pear sorbet was topped with ginger foam and was DECADENT. It was light, fluffy, sweet and just amazing. We finished both desserts. How our stomachs accommodated this much food, I can't tell you.  In the end, my fiance ordered coffee. Once AGAIN, to our surprise, Adrian came around and said he had some 45-year old port left in a bottle at the bar, just enough for two people. And proceeded to pour us some - on the house. At this point, I was overwhelmed at their generosity and the amazing service we were receiving. As we sipped and savoured our ports, we wondered what we had done to be receiving such amazing treatment.   We ended the night with some more good natured conversation with Adrian, looking at our bill in disbelief (it was WAY too little for everything we had received), and tipping Adrian HEAVILY. We took our risotto to go, which they gave to us in a little disposable lunch bag. Another nice touch, to add to the already heady experience we just had.   What an amazing night. True quality at every step, and every detail taken care of, Teatro is absolutely the 'creme de la creme' of Calgary."}
{"text":"They've still got it. I have to say it has been a while but mmmm mmmm good. Nice appys, nice room, nice waiter, nice service. Really good menu. We were just there for drinks and snacks after a Jack Singer event but I was impressed. Congrats Teatro, you've still got it!  Although I'd love to see some more Canadian wines on the wine list - especially on the By The Glass list."}
{"text":"It's fancy schmancy and I am by no means a foodie, nor do I speak Italian.  I felt a little out of place and had no idea how to order let alone what.    Hubby and I went for my birthday a couple years ago and while we enjoyed it and loved dining like we had moola, it was awkward.  Thankfully we had a very nice and understanding waiter(or whatever he would be referred to in Italian) that helped us out with the menu.    I had a starter soup that was delicious.  It was butternut squash and so so good.  I could have eaten that all night.  Hubby and I also split the caesar salad and that was tasty too.  For my meal I went with the lobster ravioli(which I think is no longer on the menu).  I felt safe and knew what that was.  It was also very tasty, but a very small portion for the price.  I now know how the rich and celebs stay skinny... they eat next to nothing!   Hubby had the Roast Parsnip Risotto which I sampled and it was delicious!  We also had a couple sides that we shared, but cannot recall what they were.    The place is really nice and I enjoyed our experience.  I would love to back and try the 8 course chef's tasting menu.  Less stress with figuring out how to order.  It was easy to book a reservation online which was convenient."}
{"text":"I was there for a corporate party, and people kept telling me how good the food is, to me food is food and if it's even remotely edible it's Good enough for me. Honestly though I have to say that was the best steak I have ever tasted. And the staff were really cool and lots of fun."}
{"text":"I recently went here for my birthday, and I can say the restaurant is forgettable. They fitted us in the such an inconvenient spot, and the waiter did not pay attention, even though there was hardly anyone in the place on a Thursday night. They do not cater to vegetarians, and the options they do point out are appetizers. The restaurant has quite a wine/liquor selection, it's better for a casual place to grab a drink. The food was decent, nothing I would take away."}
{"text":"We had another fantastic evening at Teatro! We arranged the chef's tasting menu when we made our reservation. Two of our group have food allergies that the staff accommodated.   The staff also arranged very interesting premium wine pairings.   The amuse bouche was \"peas & carrots\" consisting of carrot cake and pea sorbet paired with Paltiner Ledisse Lambrusco di Sorbana.   The first course was cloud egg paired with a beautiful Taittinger Cuvée Prestige Brut. I think this particular Champagne is normally only available through restaurants.   The second course was caprese, but grilled watermelon took the place of the usual tomato. That was paired with Weingut Spreitzer 101 Riesling.   The third course was scallops. The squid ink \"coral\" was a spectacular addition. It was paired with a distinctive Boekenhoutskloof Semillon Franschhoek. This Semillon was so good we ordered another bottle to finish the course. We also picked up some bottles the next day.   The fourth course was ravioli paired with Daniel Bouland Corelette Morgan.   The fifth course was lamb rack paired with Ultra Violet Cabernet Oakville Napa.   The dessert was white chocolate cheesecake. We tried a few dessert wines as pairings. Our favourite was the Bodega Toro Albala Don PX Pedro Xiemaez.   The food, wine and service was outstanding. This is our \"go to\" restaurant when our group is in Calgary!"}
{"text":"After I visited with Occupy Calgary to fill them in on happenings in Oakland (Ha! You guys protest in sub-freezing weather despite already having health care and progressive government!) I stepped into Teatro, despite the 1% vibe offered by the menu and the presentation of the front of the restaurant. However, as I was traveling solo, I went straight to Occupying a barstool. The staff was friendly and casual, in the right way, and I was soon talking friendly politics with the bartenders and a regular customer.  The staff guided me through the menu, and I went overboard.  The bison tartare was just insanely good. It was the Canadian grandson of the battuta di manzo from Milan, but with the deeper and gamier bison flavor, plus a serious heap of spices, like black pepper, infusing into the raw meat. The egg dressing mixed in perfectly. The caesar salad had a brilliant spread of pork-belly chunks, fried and rendered to crispness, releasing flavor into a partly deconstructed dressing. But damn, the seafood cannelloni was pure decadent heaven. A filling of lobster and other seafood (and lots of it) stuffed the pasta tube, which was then buried in a lobster-tomato bisque, cheese, and grilled/sauteed scallops and shrimp. Expensive, hugely rich, and extremely satisfying.  The wine selection was great, and the staff was helpful with the pairings. I love how every wine bar in Calgary has Montefalco Rosso.  I'd like to try this place for a formal dinner, which I suspect would be a very different experience. Perhaps the next visit to Calgary."}
{"text":"This is the No.1 place I recommend to anyone heading to Calgary. Beautiful decor and location but not so pretentious that you feel out of place in casual dress. Italian food at it's best for sure! The staff must be hand picked from the best of the best. They have a great way of being out of the way but on top of everything.  Bison Short Rib Ravioli parsley purée, forest mushroom, pecorino, truffle oil. Is to die for.  Black Linguine grilled monkfish, plum tomato, broccolini, lobster oil.  Just two examples of menu items you can look forward to."}
{"text":"For a birthday dinner, anniversary dinner or in our case, both, you just cannot beat Teatro.  Thanks to the fine Yelp reviewers, we found this place where we could not wait to spend our special evening.  Resos - YES! Make them! It was a holiday so, busy, but not packed. One floor of spacious, beautiful seating with an open kitchen to view (which I love) and white, grand pillars. (It was an old Dominion Bank and built in 1911 which is considered quite old by Calgary standards) There are a couple of parking spaces in the rear of the restaurant or you can opt to park at the Telus Convention Centre, or park for free on the roadways past 6pm. We were greeted at the entrance by the hostess and had our coats taken to the closet. We were led to our seat, a nice, large semi circle booth with service being fantastic and attentive throughout the meal. We had the soup to start (butternut squash, divine!) and calamari which was deliciously lightly breaded and presented in a really fun way. It was housed in a newspaper cone and accompanied with a spicy Korean type mayo.  We ordered a bottle of sparkling water and a bottle of white Moscato wine. It was very good and kept chilled throughout our meal. Not once did we have to pour for ourselves.  The corkage fee for anyone wanting to know is $35. Mains - we had the scallops encrusted with parsley, parsnip puree, eggplant and kale (the scallops were so properly done, pleasing texture!) and we had the rotisserie chicken with risotto and bitter beets. It was very good as well, loved the juiciness of the bird! The jus on the plate with the chicken was to die for and you could tell that a lot of love went into each plate.  We were too full for dessert but ended the meal with a cappuccino which was nice and strong, very Italian! The bill was a hefty one but you get what you pay for here. Actually, this was the most ever we paid to dine out! Just one thing - we did have to get our own coats and see ourselves out without a goodbye or any thank yous but we did not go away feeling under appreciated. We will for sure be back on another special occasion to be spoiled with quality food, fine service and local ingredients where applicable. Seasonal Menu - love that! Open for lunch Mon - Fri and open for dinner only on the weekends."}
{"text":"We came here for a wedding and it was awesome!  The venue is great for a wedding.  There is also an outdoor patio space.  We had steelhead trout and sous vide chicken.  The chicken was dry. The trout was delicious!  We also had a very creamy butternut squash soup and salad.  Dessert was chocolate mousse.  So sweet.  As the night went on, they also fed us snacks.  Sliders, cupcake bites, and mini pizzas.   Service was excellent.  I asked for butter, they got me butter.  We spilled wine, they cleaned it right away.  We broke a glass, they swept it up in a second."}
{"text":"2 stars for the decor and -3 because the food wasn't that good. Had to add additional salt and still wasn't happy with it. Especially when the bill came. I don't mind paying for good food and service. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have found myself at Teatro's for its express lunch again. It's such a perfect venue with a grand, white interior and just $25 for three courses of deliciousness. Service was surprisingly slow this time however.... My \"express\" lunch went from 12:15pm to 1:50pm today. I only meant to be away from work for an hour so I'd have to say I was quite disappointed in the snail-pace service of everything today.  Teatro's food itself was solid as usual however. Today perhaps was an off day as I have never seen it this slow in my past 20+ visits."}
{"text":"My rating is a compromise between my experience & my wife's. My meal of scallop crudo followed by scallops & pork belly was outstanding, with beautiful presentations and sophisticated flavors. And my wife started with a thick, rich delicious tomato soup, but while her halibut entree was also presented beautifully, it was so salty it was inedible. The restaurant offered to replace it with another entree, but somewhat in the interest of time she had a very nice caprese salad.  Also, the restaurant is in a old bank building, with very high ceilings and an open design that was a bit cold and drafty on a cool, rainy night."}
{"text":"After living in Calgary for many years, I finally got a chance to eat at Teatro. I knew that it was ranked as one of Calgary's best, but thought that perhaps with that might come pretentious servers,  and overpriced food. I was wrong.  From the moment we arrived, I knew we were in for a special night. The door was opened by a handsome young man -  ( discovered later it was the maitre d ) and we were welcomed in as if we were guests in someones home.  We were seated right by the kitchen pass  and our chairs faced the kitchen ( like a chefs table almost ) and felt like we had the best table in the house.  We got to watch the chef and his team work. They worked quietly and with precision, putting out wonderfully plated, clean gorgeous plates of food.  For starters, we ordered the Caprese Salad - it was made with Heirloom tomatos and Buffalo Mozarella.. The ingredients were fresh and the tomatoes were bursting with flavour.   As a vegetarian - there were a couple of options - not a ton, so I asked if it was possible for me to have a selection of the various side dishes - and like any great fine dining restaurant, they happily obliged plating up a great dish with pureed parsnips, potatoes, rapini, aspargus, mushrooms - each vegetable was delicious and treated with care. My guests ordered the Pork chop and both said it was without a doubt the best Pork Chop they had ever had - butterflied and breaded in something similar to Panko - but wasnt....they still dont know - but they loved it.   The service was excellent - the servers were \"authentic\" real and without pretension.  Although it was busy, it never felt manic in there - always calm and professional. Smiling staff and the sense that  you were there to be pampered. The restaurant itself is gorgeous inside- an old TD Bank with high ceilings and a grand feeling to it all.  The whole experience at Teatro was lovely - great staff -great food and a great night, and not a hint of pretension."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food.  We shared the steak, ceaser salad, calamari, the carbonara and the spaghetti."}
{"text":"I've heard really big raves about this restaurant and I was expecting something excellent, but it was far from it.  I came here yesterday evening with my boyfriend. We came an hour early and thought of just asking the restaurant if it was okay if we come in early. To my surprise they accommodated us, which was great. Although, I think they had no choice considering they might as well have since there was only a party of 4. We were seated and I started to notice that the waiter was treating me and my boyfriend as if we were lower class in comparison to the party of 4. I thought I was going crazy, but there were 3 women and he welcomed them and made conversation. I overheard the waiter telling the party of 4 what the special was (unless I was hearing things) but he treated them very special. I also noticed once the party of 4 and party of 3 got their food they had each waiter tell them exactly what was in the food. My boyfriend and I were just told what we ordered and that was basically it.  The food was alright (to be honest, I've had better) We ordered the calamari for starters and I ordered the bolognese and it was pretty salty. My boyfriend got steak and he enjoyed his meal. The calamari was basic, nothing exciting. I've had better calamari in pubs then this place. At one point I kept adding pepper into my bolognese and the waiter came out of nowhere and just put chili flakes on the table without saying anything. So I just looked at it with surprise and moved my glass of water to give him room and he looked at me and said: \"did you want this?\" and I was like: \"oh, sorry, no thanks!\" he responded with: \"Oh, I noticed you kept grinding pepper that you'd want some chili flakes.\" And I was polite and said: \"no thanks\" again. I thought it was pretty weird and the way he responded was kinda rude with a little bit of attitude. Even when the waiter was placing our plates he just tossed the napkin on top of the plate. It just seemed very unprofessional for an establishment that seems fine dining. Later on in the night he asked the party of 4 and party of 3: \"how was the food?\" Not once has he asked me and my boyfriend anything. We were handed the dessert menu and I just told my boyfriend I wanted to leave because I felt disrespected and I was also full too. I noticed a family had walked in and they sat across from us. They were treated the same way everyone else was treated, not surprised. I felt discriminated because my boyfriend and I look young and we were the only Asian guests in the restaurant. I think I was more thrown off by the service. The waiter had some sort of attitude like he hated his job or he only cared for those who looked like they have money (he wants that big tip) Honestly, I would have rather spent the time going to McDonalds vs. this place. This place is way too bougie for me."}
{"text":"I love the scallop lasagna. On my visit they introduced a new wine which they said kinda pricey but worth to pair with my seafood menu. I always take a risk and yes, the lady server was absolutely correct! My afternoon with Teatro was a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at Teatro twice over the past few weeks, and have thoroughly enjoyed both dining experiences.  Fantastic menu all around, an extensive wine and cocktail list, and exceptional service.  I felt like I was dining in an upscale Parisian brasserie!  And any place that makes a REAL Dark n' Stormy with authentic ginger beat is alright by me!  I've tried the wild boar meatballs, calamari, gnocchi, beet salad, crème brulee and pistachio cake.  I didn't really care for the crème brulee as it was made with earl grey tea.  My only complaint about the gnocchi was that I wanted more!  I was in a group, and some others had larger entrees, so I had to eat my gnocchi veeeerrrry slowly.  Overall, I've enjoyed the meals I've had there and will definitely continue to come back."}
{"text":"No matter where we try, teatro remains one of my top 2. This place is a go to for romance, and a leisurely meal. Do not come here to eat and run, you come to stay awhile and relax.... The outter world doesn't exist while here. Enjoy the tasting menu, or just the entrees. The best calamari I've ever had, and an amazing  ceaser salad.  Wasn't a fan of our waiter , too snobby for my liking. I love great food , I have no problem paying for great food, I just like it sans snobbery. I asked for a glass of rose and was informed that its a poor choice as its low quality... Umm I dont care, I like it, now be a dear and go fetch it. Thanks.  Apart from that I will return whenever my hubby allows me ;)  Merci teatro, I love that I can rely on you  when my mouth wants to party."}
{"text":"Amazing! I went on a date here and we had the chefs tasting menu. John pulled out all of the stops and even took us on a tour of the place afterwards. It helps that I know him but I believe any customer would be treated this way. The ice cream for the final course was fun to watch and my date and I had a hard time deciding on which course we liked the best. Next time we go we will try a few items off the menu as they read very well."}
{"text":"Went to Teatro after not visiting it in 10 years or so and was very pleasantly surprised.   The menu was diverse, the food was delicious and the service was superb. The architecture and decor have always been a cut above everyone else.  I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both with large groups.  The staff is great at servicing a large group well and making everyone feel like they're in a luxury restaurant.  It probably helps that they are in a luxury restaurant, but still great service.  Food was very good.  What you would expect from a place with a strong reputation like this.  If you ask a concierge where to go, good chance they will point you here.  I'd definitely go again, and also be interested in trying it with a small group."}
{"text":"I really wanted to leave a review for this restaurant because it's a special place . Went here a few months ago and need to give props to the outstanding staff who really made this a memorable dining experience for our group. The atmosphere abs decor is really superb and the food that we were served matched ."}
{"text":"I wish there were six stars to give this restaurant! We went for dessert and wine after the play and as usual everything was perfect. The waiters were amazing, the food was excellent and the wine was the perfect pairing thanks to the sommelier. Thank you teatros for your continuing excellence over the years. We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"I was at a private event at Teatro in the Opera room.   I had never been to Teatro for more than just a glass of wine before but it's been \"on the list\" for some time so I was beyond excited to get an invite here.  Teatro and the Opera room (which has a separate entrance around the side) are gorgeous..  but that's to be expected in a renovated historical bank building.   Service is stellar but I wasn't mesmerized by the food which was pretty sad for me.     They started with bread which was great except I got a fragment of olive pit that could have broken a tooth.  The wine selection was good (I already know Teatro has a great selection).  We had arancini which was above average.  A mixed green salad which was so boring it may have been a garnish.  Wild mushroom risotto which was good but nothing amazing.  Dessert was tiramisu which was pretty tasty (there is a layer in the middle that's so juicy and refreshing and the rest is a creamy dream).   Overall it was a good meal - olive pit aside - but I know what the organizer paid for that meal and that's where it unravels for me...  Even 50% would have been pushing it but justifiable for a private catered event in a beautiful building downtown based on what was served.  Maybe that was acceptable when oil boomed and Teatro hasn't caught up.  I don't know.  Eating on the other side is still \"on the list\" but I'm a bit worried after this experience that the food and price tag don't live up to the hype or historical reputation of the establishment."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Downgrade. I agree with the real reviews scattered among the 4 and 5 star posts. This restaurant appears to be living on its location, marketing and name recognition. The food is still pretty good but the service, although prompt, can't squeeze a smile or any thing close to what one would call good and friendly service. This, after several visits. There has been little noticeable improvement. There is better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Try the calamari!  Great food, nice atmosphere - Would have gave it 5 stars if we got to sit in the rounded huge tables, but you should probably ask to reserve them as they are popular.  Great stephen ave location, close to theatre calgary."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. I don't go often but when I do, it's usually for a special occasion. The food is always great, love the ambience, and always great wines to choose from. Definitely try it if you haven't before, Make sure to save room for desert. I have always lucked out with parking, there is lots of downtown parking lots and free street parking close by after 6pm."}
{"text":"Teatro is a great historic building in Calgary, I'm not super fancy schmancy so I hadn't prioritized stopping by for dinner. This weekend though there I attended a big deal birthday in the Opera room, you enter the room from 1st on the side of the building and it's nice and private, great for an event or private function. The a staff were very friendly and accommodating, they were quick to take our coats, offer drinks and chat with us throughout the event. They had both cocktail tables and smaller sit down seating on the side which was very nice, you never know when you need to give your toes a quick break. The wine was delicious and they event improvised shooters when requested (so maybe we're not that fancy after all) the passed appetizers were delicious and the risotto in the cheese wheel was two thumbs up. Great evening and a wonderful venue for a special occassion or celebration."}
{"text":"This was an almost perfect dining experience. The meal - in form of a 3 course lunch special- was flavourful and exciting. The service was impeccable, which in no way surprises me. Teatro has a history in Calgary. Where other restaurants come and go, Teatro evolves. The only tiny swerve from perfection was the sparkling red Piedmont. It may as well have been sparkling cran-apple juice. This is not a complaint so much as extremely unexpected. I have a sweet tooth, so my wife and I switched glasses, and I'm certain that they would have replaced had we asked.   Teatro is a little piece of heaven in the heart of busy downtown Calgary. Do yourself a favour and participate."}
{"text":"A lot of mixed feelings about this place, in general I am not a big fan of fine dining. However, when I dine at such restaurants I have ultra high expectations.   We went there on a Saturday night for the chef tasting menu. There was total of 8 courses paired with different type of wines (Almost 300$).   Before I describe the food, I should mention that the service is excellent and nothing short of Michelin star restaurants. On the other hand, the food for me was a lot of hit and misses during the night with more miss than hits.   We started the dinner with an asparagus soup which was not that tasty and too watery in my opinion. Then we had the beet salad which was tasteless. Afterward was the biggest disappointment of the night, the cured meat and melon course. This is a very classic combination which does not required any cooking at all. However, they managed to process the melon to a state that ruined the taste and texture. A good example of keep it simple stupid analogy. However, the next course, was the highlight of the dinner, smoked coconut pasta. A truly unique flavor and perfectly balanced. The fish and meat course was good but nothing special. The cheese and apple course was a disappointment again. The cheese was again transformed in to a very unpleasant soup. The meal was finished with probably the best ice cream of my life. Salted caramel , soft and creamy.   In general, I do not believe I will go back there. For almost 300$, I was expecting more. It was good food but when you go to a restaurant you expect to be wowed. You don't want to eat a very good steak and potato mash which probably you can have a much better version of it at any good steak house.   Somebody told me that Teatro deserves a Michelin star, I should say not even in their dreams. They are not even close to the quality and flavor of a Michelin star restaurant. Most people cannot be amazed by the gimmicks and at the end of the night they will just remember the taste."}
{"text":"I've been to fine dining restaurants all over the world, and this restaurant is far and away the absolute worst service and cuisine, I've ever had at any such establishment. The pork belly was so tough that it was inedible and when I asked to have it sent back I then had to deal with their kitchen staff from their keen kitchen, glaring at me for the remainder of my meal. They sent me a salad to eat while I waited for my new order to be ready, which was horribly bitter and otherwise utterly bland. Then when my duck finally arrived, the sides were absolutely disgusting. Though that may be personal bias, as it was essentially a raisin based stuffing, and I despise raisins. Especially when heated and mixed with a mystery mush. It was also the only time in my life, that a manager has not come to speak with me after having a dish sent back. Also it is the only time I've ever been to such an establishment, where in my husband had to poor our wine for us, as our server so rarely returned to our tale. I will never come back to this establishment, which is unfortunate for them. As my husband and I frequent Calgary very regularly, and prefer fine dining during our stays there. The fact that this restaurant has such a high rating frankly is astonishing to me. As I wouldn't even recommend my enemies to eat here. I would give this restaurant zero stars if it were an option."}
{"text":"Teatro has seen better days  The last time I ate at Teatro was over 15 years ago and at that time, it was very good. However 15 years later, the restaurant seems to be stuck in old times and more intent on filling the private dining area which probably offers a set menu at a volume discount, rather than advancing the food and service of the main dining area.  The interior is a renovated version of the historic Dominion Bank building and is indeed wonderful. High ceilings with large windows and tall support beams encase a variety of seating options. The interior view is indeed pleasant.  The menu itself is an attempt to modernize basic Italian cooking and offers some eclectic dishes such as rabbit and wild boar. The average entree prices are above $30, the seafood lasagna is a hefty $39, and the lobster risotto $38. The lobster risotto was loaded with butter and weak in texture.  The Caesar salad is a small collection of romaine leaves with a garlic citrus dressing which altogether is very underwhelming and at $16, almost absurd. The Tagliatelle Bolognese is a small clump of (to my liking....overcooked) pasta with parmigiano on top. At a restaurant of this magnitude (i.e. \"these prices\"), I would expect a waiter to come over with a block of parmigiano and shave a desired amount on the dish. And the same goes for fresh pepper which instead of being applied in a desired amount by a waiter, is relegated to a small acrylic grinder that had been handled by loads of previous guests and surely not cleaned every time. It is sure a strong carrier of germs.  However if the prices and the lack of personalized services don't mesh that's one thing, but having a waiter who seems to be paid a commission on the size of the bill and his penchant for pushing cocktails on the guests at every chance, is a tad \"old school\" and very annoying.  I arrive with one other guest and the waiter asks \"can I get you a cocktail\". I reply, \"we are waiting on two other guests and I think we should wait. The waiter replies \"I assure you it is not impolite to go ahead and order a drink\". I reply, \"no thanks, we'll wait\". Waiter comes back 2 minutes later and asks \"Are you sure you don't want to order a cocktail\". We finish our meal and are ready to leave because we pre-advise the waiter we were going to the hockey game and the waiter says \"sure you wouldn't like one more drink before the game?\". Are you serious?  You can fool some of the people some of the time but not all of the people two times. I would recommend the waiters be a bit more humble and back off on the sales pitch. Or, lower prices by 30% and pitch away!  Teatro does have a convenient location and a nice interior and I would think the private area would also be attractive for corporate events. However as far as service and food quality, there are many other places that are better and less expensive in Calgary."}
{"text":"Our group first time in this evening. Best Of...everything here. Beautiful setting, great service for all our dining desires. My dinners was the octopus on a spinach pasta. Most flavorful things I have eaten for long time. Also had the wild mushroom risoto on side. We had a calamari app and I had a pistachio dessert first up. Really good. One guest had the guinea bird and said good. Beautiful presentation throughout and very gracious ladies attending all our requests. A wonderful dining experience here."}
{"text":"For the caliber of the name and the hype that Teatro garners, I can't help but say that my experience has fallen short of the high expectations set for the restaurant. I visited Teatro for the Chef's Tasting menu to celebrate a friend's birthday. The ambiance is wonderful - the décor is tasteful and the high ceilings of the former TD building made for a character dining experience. The kitchen is open concept, which is cool. We were seated at a \"desirable\" table which was a round table for two with a semi-circular booth seat, which personally I didn't find very comfortable as I found myself with a neck kink after having my head 70 degrees to the side to talk to my friend over dinner for 2.5 hours. I personally prefer traditional seating, but I suppose some people like that intimacy!   My friend let the waitress know that he had a seafood allergy and if they could please modify the menu so that there was no seafood - they were wonderfully accommodating about that, but this would come back to complicate things later that evening, as apparently HIS allergy meant that I wasn't going to receive the original tasting menu with seafood. I wasn't informed of this fact, and obviously by the time I had found out, it was too late to have that addressed.    Over 7 or so courses, I found that in general the food wasn't to the mind and tastebud blowing quality that I've come to expect from tasting menus at restaurants of this caliber and price range. A few specific comments about the courses:   The \"modern/hip\" style caprese salad with heirloom tomoates was not appropriately seasoned. With only a few small pieces of tomato and an unseasoned soft mozzarella-like cheese, the cheese had no flavor and a touch of salt and pepper would have made a world of difference and brought out the flavor of the cheese. In fact, it was so bland that I couldn't even finish the conservative portion.  The butternut squash soup - exquisite, it was smooth, velvety, rich, and absolutely a treat.  The \"gnocchi\" with pancetta and cheese \"strips\"? I found to be a over salted, dry, and really not that tasty.  The first main, which was a rolled pork tenderloin? cut, served with a tangy berry based sauce and a creamy sauce with mushrooms, I was actually disappointed in. I suspect this was supposed to be a seafood or fish course, which was swapped out on account of my friends dietary restrictions, so perhaps it wasn't perfected.... The salt used to season the skin side of the rolled meat cut was chunky, and used too liberally to the point where I could literally feel the salt melt in my mouth and made for a less desirable experience.  The second main was a cut of duck that was absolutely a redemption - it was tender, juicy, and delicious. I would have chosen to have double that!   Service, in general, was 100% excellent. Upon realizing that the dessert was chocolate and that my friend didn't previously inform on his chocolate allergy (yes, he's a difficult one), they were extremely thoughtful in offering him sorbets on the house instead. (I had both chocolate desserts, oops.)   I think for this caliber of fine dining, our experience definitely left a fair number of missed opportunities on the table (or rather, in the kitchen). For this price range ($300 for two), I routinely had my mind blown on tasting menus in Montreal, so I'm hoping that this was just a bit of an off experience due to the unusual dietary restrictions, so with that in mind I'll definitely give this another shot eventually after I've tried some of the other tasting menus around town."}
{"text":"Solid Food - Poor Service  I've been to Teatro four times over the last three years, and have been consistently disappointed.   Food at times excels, although too many dishes lack flavours and/or presentation to get overly excited about.  Overall though, I'd rate the food at 4/5.  There are better places to go in the city given the pricing at Teatro, with very healthy markups on wines taking away from the experience for those that enjoy wine with their meals.  The biggest issue we have is the service - the experience for my wife and I has been that it is repeatedly one of the worst places in the city for service.  I've been through an entire dinner pouring my own $200 bottle of wine, with empty water glasses sitting there.  To be fair, we did see the head waiter give our waiter a lecture while pointing at our table.  Our last visit in May 2018 was for lunch, we sat for close to 20 minutes before being able to order drinks.  The \"express\" lunch took 1 hour and 40 minutes by the time we were able to pay (waiting 20 minutes after requesting the bill).  Unfortunately, this has been similar to our other visits - and we give up.  Sorry Teatro, but four chances is more than enough.  If I was in the kitchen I'd have a few words for the servers if I was staring out at tables with empty water glasses or dishes sitting for ages after the entire table had finished eating."}
{"text":"Decided to update my review. They've changed the menu. Perhaps it's a seasonal thing but it's an improvement. Service was better (good) and food was better as well, except the calamari wasn't crispy and the dipping sauce that it comes with didn't wow me. I love the half sized pastas which leaves room in your stomach to try more items. They do have a 3-course lunch for $25 for those who work near by. The proximity to jack singer concert hall is awesome."}
{"text":"The starter bread served was really good.  I think it was Focaccia.  I ordered salmon on a bed of (some kind of) chickpeas and greens. It was delicious.    Teatro is housed in the historic Dominion Bank Building in downtown Calgary.  The interior is quite nicely done with high ceilings and an open concept kitchen.  It has a nice atmosphere without being too stiff.  Service was attentive and prompt too.  Great for date nights!"}
{"text":"\"Hey dude. I've got a voucher and reservation. Both expire at 6:00 tonight. Can you come out for a free 5-star meal?\"  Yeah, that's how my night went tonight. And it ruled. Teatro is one of those fancy places where you're supposed to use the right kind of plates, lay your napkin on your lap, fold your hands neatly and drink absurdly expensive wines just because someone told you they'd go good with your duck.  And you know what? It kicks ass. This fancy-shmancy place made me feel like a baller and was the perfect way to celebrate the fact that I bought a house and own a car that only takes premium.   So while I'm now way too poor to afford to eat anything but couch cushions for the rest of the month and any dates I go on will probably be walks around my neighborhood, Teatro left a good taste in my mouth.  Our server took notice of the fact that I had absolutely no class whatsoever (read: I haven't been fancy dining in a long time, so I forget the rules) but was a perfect gentleman, folding my napkin on my lap for me and hooking me up with the bread plate with only so much as a \"With your permission, sir.\"  Yeah, he called me sir. And that's gratifying as heck.  I had the Bolognese. It was a reasonable size considering fancy places usually have more garnish than actual edible food. It was also delicious, the cheese had a mild sweetness to it that made everything even more wonderful. I paired it with a Rose wine, because I am a genius sommelier myself. Just kidding... I ordered the Rose because I love them and they're cheaper than the $2,850 bottle I saw somewhere on the menu.  For an appetizer we had the calamari, which was perfectly crispy and really flavorful. There was a fancy spicy sauce that added the perfect zing to the calamari. I would probably have eaten it with my fingers but I think someone would have probably pulled a Gucci-brand machete on me for my lack of classiness.  I finished the night off with the tirimasu. It was like an angel had an orgasm in my mouth. I know that's sort of crass, but that's the only way I can put it that adequately captures how perfect this desert was.  Oh yeah, and we had a voucher, so it was less than one billion dollars.  In the end, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who owns at least one pair of nice pants and a collared shirt."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about TeAtro so when Big Taste was here, I was excited as they offered a 5 course gourmet dinner for $65.  Reservations were made Thursday night for 7:45PM. Teatro is located downtown so you could imagine parking can be impossible to find.  They do have a small lot but I would say it fits about 8-10 cars and its quite tight.  There were 5 of us ladies who came to dine.  The Big Taste menu was handed to us and waters were immediately filled and our server introduced himself.  We all saw the menu ahead of time and I was scoped out some photos on social media so we knew what we wanted.  We were handed a basket of complimentary breads and I took a piece of what looked similar to focaccia, I took a bite and it was unexpectedly salty.  Other breads were nothing special but we were starving so it made do.    First course, the majority of us ordered the house-cured bresaola which is air dried salted beef and it came with arugula, pickled apple and shaved foie gras.  The portion was tiny and I could swipe the beef with my fork and it would all be gone in a bite.  The other option was carrot and saffron soup which my one friend ordered Course 2 was between beef tartar and eggplant.  I ordered the eggplant and tomato terrine dish which apparently had house cured egg yolk and fennel.  I could only taste tomato throughout the whole dish - not impressed.  I tried a bite of beef tartar and it was good! Flavorful and much better than the eggplant.  As time went on, our waters were filled and it was nice that each dish didn't take too much time in between.  Course 3 options were sweet pea risotto or thyme gnocchi.  The sweet pea risotto came with little pieces of pancetta, it was mixed with some mascarpone and micro greens. I enjoyed this dish and if it was 4 times bigger, it would have been perfect.  It was smooth and creamy with the crunch to the peas and the saltiness of the pancetta, a great combination. I tried the gnocchi which was in mushroom bolognese sauce and I found it way too soft.  I like gnocchi that has a bite but this gnocchi just melted away with no flavor.    Moving on to the main course and the options were braised pork shoulder and salmon.  I was the only one who went with the salmon and was rather disappointed when it came.  It was a very thin piece of salmon on top of cauliflower mixture with a little brush of lemon preserve, it didn't take me long to finish. The rest had the pork shoulder and I was quite jealous when I saw their decent size of meat.  Their pork was on top of some cicerchia which is similar to chick peas and mixed with some sweet and sour onions.  I had a taste and it wasn't anything special and my gfs weren't impressed either - some didn't even finish it all.  Last but not least, my favorite part of dining...dessert. I went with the chocolate hazelnut torta, and a couple went with the lemon meringue tart.  I've been pretty excited because I was looking at photos on Instagram.  The chocolate torta was OK, I was super sad to discover that the 'ice cream' on the side wasn't ice cream but vin cotta :( the candied hazelnuts were nice but overall the torta again, wasn't anything special.  I tried a bite of the lemon tart and immediately regretted ordering the torta.  Although it was super sweet, it was better.  The meringue was a nice crunch and there was a balanced tartiness.  Our overall experience was meh.  I had really high expectations for Teatro and I was sadly let down.  The service was okay - not once did they come by and ask how everything was but they did come and top up our waters frequently.  Luckily they did offer complimentary bread at the beginning or else we would have been hungrier even though we were still hungry at the end. The presentation of each course was nice but the taste just wasn't worth the price to me.  Yes, I do understand fine dining but if the portions are tiny and taste amazing it's definitely worth it but these portions were just tiny and didn't blow me (or us) out of the water. We all left hungry."}
{"text":"There are certain things not up for comparison.  Shakespeare plays, Stanley Kubrick movies, the Bugatti Veyron, Ava Gardner, Robotech, elements of our society which cannot be rated alongside others despite sharing similar traits.  Reasons can be varied, from being so far beyond the quality of others that such comparisons are meaningless, to the subject in question being so far removed from the standard tropes associated with the others that comparing them is like rating which is better, The Simpsons or a peanut butter and banana sandwich.    Teatro falls into this latter category--a restaurant offering an experience so detached from any other I had encountered thus far as to preclude any comparison.  I mean, is it Italian, French?  It's not a family restaurant; it feels like a posh bistro.  It has a tasting menu with I eventually ordered.  Yet with all these common attributes, the resulting meal still cannot be measured to others, not even to Claridges.  That's not to mean it's better by any account, just different...and yes, it's also better.  But that superiority comes with a price, a hefty one preventing one from repeating such a visit weekly or even monthly.  Despite my desire to return to Teatro again, I can't see myself taking in the tasting menu for a very long time.  Even if I moved to Calgary, I'd still save Teatro for only the most treasured of special occasions, like if I had a special date or a...a...okay, that's really all I got, and it would be one to secure a second to be sure, or actually more like a fourth.  She would have to be Ava Gardner in The Killers to warrant Teatro on a first date.    So what makes Teatro special?  It's something called molecular gastronomy--a subdivision of food science dedicated to unique and obscure approaches to cooking in order to create, in many situations, wholly new results from traditional ingredients.  It involves the study of chemical interactions and physical changes depending on temperature and pressure.  Admittedly, this can sound a bit elitist as some of the techniques involve the use of vacuum chambers, evaporators, and ultrasounds.  The end product is often served in small portions with multiple courses to showcase the various examples of the craft.  This is what Teatro offers with their extremely pricey tasting menu, all eight courses of it.    I made the reservation for the last day of my trip, a consequence of downtown Calgary being three feet below water not two weeks earlier.  I was lucky to get in when I did.  I was offered a spot in sight of the expansive open kitchen, next to a window where wind and rain was molesting the unsecured patio seats outside.  There really isn't much I can say about the decor of Teatro, other than its simply magnificent.  I adore the fact that the plating area is brightly lit from low hanging lamps so patrons can see the attention to detail given.  I adore the high ceilings, the wrought iron rails, the Greek pillars.    I made a point to cherish each course--I needed to considering that the whole experience was setting me back $135.  I was presented with a platter of salt, a spoon, and some olive oil.  I still have no clue what I was supposed to do with that other than perhaps make an impromptu bread dip, but I lacked the balsamic and a plate to use other than the one the bread arrived with.  I ended up leaving it alone.  After an amuse bouche, the experience began.    I could go into details of each dish, but half of the time, I didn't even know what I was eating.  Each plate was barely three bites, four tops. I recognized homemade pasta, truffle shavings, and sea scallops.  What I didn't recognize was the grilled compressed basil, the lemon garlic foam, the focaccia lace, vegetable ash, parmesan custard, confit de' grapefruit and the halibut basted in squid ink.  Yes, you heard right, vegetable ash.  What, you were hanging on, the squid ink?  Well, yes, that is kind of odd.  Most of the time, I didn't even know what the waiter was saying as he switched from a flawlessly spoken French pronunciation to English, often times mid sentence.   Despite these unique combinations and textures, was it any--well, of course it was good, amazing even.  The pasta with compressed basil with parmesan custard was a particular highlight.  However, the real jewel was the last, the raspberry sorbet made in front of me with liquid nitrogen and a stand mixer.  These are only two examples of the eight courses.  In all it took almost two hours for the evening to end.  I felt satisfied but not full.  The waiter was incredibly adept in his craft, on equal stature with the chefs.    Value on the other hand is probably up to opinion.  Everything was at the top of its game, an upper echelon of the industry, but is it worth $180 with tax and gratuity.  I would say yes with the caveat that it's an experience that you may only have once.  So why not try it once?"}
{"text":"I have been to Teatro on two separate occasions. A wedding reception and a private romantic outing.   The wine selection is great and is easily paired with a expertly curated menu. The building is historic with great ambience and charm. The staff is friendly and provide AAA service.   Teatro is part of the upper echelon of fine dining in Calgary, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"In Montreal, there's a popular steak and seafood resto in the heart of beautiful Old Montreal called Gibby's.  The food there is simply decadent, and while maybe not the best steak place around, it is rated by local Montrealers as the best restaurant to go to if SOMEONE else was paying the bill.  This is my feelings about Teatro.  A year or so after Teatro's renovations, my companion and I went down there to celebrate her 40th birthday.  I normally don't go to what would probably be perceived by most locals as an upscale resto, but it was a special occasion after all.  It was probably one of the best choices I've made.  The place feels huge, with the classic roman pillars, large windows and immense space yet almost sparsely placed tables.  It's not that there weren't huge numbers of tables. but more that there were far less tables that the space could hold, a deliberate choice that keeps the appearance and feeling of intimacy.  Add some of the unusual furniture, such as these enormous fabric backed booth-like chairs, and it does have a pleasant cozy feel to the place.  Add the open-faced kitchen where the diners could easily see their food being prepared, the incredibly huge copper ovens, and the light jazz playing in the background, you can see that there was a fair amount of thought put into the experience.  Now as for the wine lists and all, Teatro has routinely year after year won awards for their immence selection of wines.   Please note, WINES not beers or anything else.  They do want to keep the upscale image after all, though I didn't see a single bottle available under $90 at the least, with most in the $150+ range.  Sooo, if you're there to drink, be prepared for the ticket shock.  Still, as I said before, this is an upscale restaurant for the connaiseur, not the average joe blow down the street.  Heck, both times I've been here, the first was for the first Downtown Dining festival, and this time around with the added support of a rare groupon event that Teatro participated in earlier this year.  You've been waiting for me to talk about the food, right?  Yep, this is where the rating went to 4 and not 5 stars.  My meal was simply outstanding, and in many ways, I think it may have honestly ruined beef for me for the rest of my life.  This was the first time I ever had Alberta beef in the new sous-vide preparation style.  Now, ever since I even heard of this practice from season 3 of Top Chef, I had always wanted to try it.  Olives apparently does it from time to time, and I've never been lucky enough to hit a night when it serves beef or lamb this way.  The absolutely fabulous Rouge does (review to follow in a day or two), and I admittedly found it's sous-vide treatment of Octopus to be incredibly unbelievably tender.  But still, actual sous-vided meat had eluded me over the years until this night.    Now, first, for those not in the know, sous-vide, described by wikipedia, is \"a method of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath for a long time--72 hours is not unusual--at an accurately determined temperature much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 60 °C or 140 °F. The intention is to cook the item evenly, not overcook the outside while still keeping the inside at the same 'doneness' and to keep the food juicier.\"  Based on years of Top Chef seasons, I was simply facinated by the whole process, and the descriptions that meats prepared this way is simply undescribably incredible.  Yep, definately.  My striploin had a texture very unlike that of a steak (except for the exterior which seemed to have been flash seared for colour and appearance), but instead much more like smoked salmon.  It could almost be cut by my fork, but I was more than satisfied that I was able to cut it effortlessly with a butter knife.  Add what was probably the richest most buttery mashed potatoes and an interesting sweet vegetable medley, and it was a simple, yet elegant dinner.  As for how buttery?  Well, it was more stick of butter than potatoes admittedly.  While I admit it was incredibly rich and utterly delicious, I also had the taste of butter in my mouth the next morning as well.  The meal then progressed with a brilliant trio of Creme Brulees, being caramel, chocolate and mint tea flavours.  Everything had a great flavour, texture ad so on, with a nice perfect hardness of the caramalized sugar on top that breaks just right with a solid tap with my spoon.  If there was any complaint I would have had about this, it was simply that it may have sat for a little while too long after the torch, as I was a bit surprised to find the hard candied tops to be quite cold.  Overall, great atmosphere, wonderful food and absolutely astounding wine list, but it's a place I would go once in a blue moon.  Why?  Well, as my opening paragraph said about Gibby's, Teatro is EXACTLY that for most Calgarians. It's simply way too expensive for the average diner.. but I'll be back one day."}
{"text":"That was a fabulous dinner and experience! It was my fifth time at Teatro, and although some experiences ranged somewhere pretentious and boring, this last experience was excellent. Our server was great, all staff that waited on us were fabulous. We came on a Sunday night so it wasn't too busy, i'd say at least 60-70% full.  We ordered a Caesar salad. Probably one of the best I've ever tried in my life. It was simple and unassuming but packed with flavor, fresh ingredients and so happy about the quality because that's what you expect when you come to a restaurant like this. The staff explained the courses as they came out, another bonus.  My date and I shared everything. They were accommodating with that, very understanding and split plates for us. Next came the pasta course. It was delectable. I close my eyes with delight. The textures, the flavors, all to such a high standard.  Then we ordered the lamb. It was very good. Throughout our meal, we had our glass of wine, which was so lovely. Our server helped him choose and that was great.  We saw a couple of famous actors come in for dinner. That was exciting. I guess they are shooting AMC's Hell on Wheels. It was a fun and unexpected highlight.  The bill came up to around $120? Expensive. Was it worth it? We used some gift cards I had saved from a couple years ago. There was no problem with that. It was a fun night :)) I'll say four stars."}
{"text":"The food was great!!... But the service reaaaally sloooooow!!... It took them more than 40 min to bring the main dishes... We didn't order appetizer, as it was a business lunch, and we expected to be there only for one hour... We had to stay there almost 2 hours just waiting for the main dishes. And we ordered as soon as we arrived. In addition, to get the bill we had to wait about 15 min since we asked for it... Definitely not a place for lunch if you don't have 2 hours available for it!!.. The only good thing was that at least the food was very good, really nothing to complain about it.. If they would have had a good service they would be rated way better!.. This is one of those places where you say, having good food is not enough, you definitely need to offer good service as well.."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch with thoughtful service. They know how to treat teachers right! #cctc2013"}
{"text":"Came here for the Taste of Calgary event, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  I had the Bistecca (sirloin) for the main course, but also tasted the trout, which was quite nice. Service was friendly and helpful. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Still one of my top restaurants in Calgary and my visits to Teatro have extended over a decade now so that says something about the staying power of this fine establishment.   I most recently had the duck which was excellent as was the presentation. My loss of a star is for listing wine in the menu that they do not have in stock.certainly not the end of the world but then again, for a high end establishment re: $$$, details count.  Fantastic environment, excellent food and almost always top notch service for when you want that special dining experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, however over the many years I dined here, I've always had a fantastic experience.    At first when you walk in, it seems a bit cold, but once you are whisked away by the hostess, the servers make you feel right at home.  The lobster lasagna was my favorite, however that may have changed in the last while.  I always enjoyed the various menu items.  This place is one of the original great modern yet classical (I know that's an oxymoron) restaurant that has lasted so many years before Calgary became as 'metropolitan' with it's dining as it is now."}
{"text":"What goes better with a trip to \"the Theatre\" than a stop beforehand at Teatro?  This upscale riff on Italian fare provides its audience with a series of stages worth applauding.  Everything is very well prepared and full of complex flavour.   It is in the end, however, the service that deserves a standing ovation. From the front of house to table service, every move is choreographed in such a way that your every need is thought of and taken care with swift accuracy. This is by far one of the most well-managed restaurants I have ever been to.  The interior of the restaurant is elegant.  High ceilings, pillars with decorative capitals, a massive copper range hood; from the moment you walk in, there is an air of breathability and class. It is unfortunate that some of adornments (such as tea-lights from Ikea on the table and child-like stars on the glass) slightly cheapen the place. Other than that, it is very well decorated.  Some of the dishes (like the Vine Ripened Tomato Tart) I am certain will beckon me back to Teatro once again. But great food does not often come without great price, so sadly, it cannot be TOO often."}
{"text":"Eight years in YYC and I only just now make it to this famous, oh so famous restaurant!  WELL WORTH THE WAIT.. (or time lost?)...  With tickets to the CPO Lord of the Rings event (Amazing btw..) we went to Teatro for supper pre-show to give it a whirl...and its 10 steps from the Epcor center.  Immediately wowed upon entry.. how beautiful, and refined, and glamorous, and old, and.. they let me actually in...good start. Service is amazing right off the bat, but thats going to be expected. We're seated close to the kitchen with a nice big round table for eight of us. A ridiculously handsome server asked for some drink orders, introduced us to the menu and allowed us as much as we needed for anything...it was clear they were giving us the evening.. it was quite nice. We ordered a number of wines/beers and started on the menu. For a high end resto it was bigger than most and of course EVERYTHING looked amazing. Picking stuff out is ridic challenging at times.  It was cool to see almost everyone order something different. I chose the pickled root veg for my appie and the sable fish for the main (FOTD). My appie arrived like art on a plate. It was a bunch of tiny veg standing upright in a circle with some local bits of goat cheese and some japanese white liquid that I simply cannot place a name on at the moment. It was literally beautiful. The oysters arrived pretty amazing looking with some caviar on the side and a mixture of sauces. The fish for the main was also quite amazing and perfectly paired with delicious veg. My partner had the salmon with lemon foam and lentil accompaniment.  A couple of us shared a stuffed pasta that was provolone stuffed for half and mushroom stuffed on the other half. This was also beautifully checkerboard plated and was very rich and mouth watering. This was highly recommended as a share plate - 10 out of 10 on this for sure.   As we had time, we did a round of desserts that were clearly winners!! The creme brûlée was heaven, the tiramisu was some of the best I have ever had and another person ordered a salted caramel sorbet that was not on the menu but was A-MAZE-ING!!!!  This place lived up to its name for sure. Food was outstanding, service was perfect and the atmosphere was kinda relaxed and romantic for such a classy spot. Great location for a night out or specifically a date night to go \"sharesies\"."}
{"text":"This review can't carry too much weight considering we were only there for 10 minutes, but we managed.  We got there for an early appetizer and the 4 of us were the only ones there.  By early I mean like 2:30, so wasn't surprised to see the place empty.  The server sat us, took our drink order and then we told her we were in a hurry for an appointment.  We just wanted to have an appetizer and have a drink.    She came back in 5 minutes with the burrata we ordered, we ate, had a drink got the bill and were out of there.  The drinks were perfect, the cheese was amazing and the patio was just beautiful.  Our server had no problem dealing with our request to speed things along and managed to keep our drinks and waters flowing the whole time! Thanks Teatro!!"}
