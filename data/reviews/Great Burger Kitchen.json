{"text":"OK not great, service needs some work. 
The beef burgers need a bit more seasoning. A bit more salt and pepper would do. They were better than your food court or average burger place though. Definitely much better than the famed Burgers Priest. The buns were cold which wasn't nice especially combined with the hot burger. Unfortunate that fries are extra. Ordered  burgers for my girlfriend and I, both of which came out wrong. To my surprise I was told \"we can only remake 1\". Primarily for that reason, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday, lightly rainy night, around 8pm ish.  Not busy, just two other take away orders. 
 
Service was friendly.  
Interesting choice of toppings
I ordered the classic burger, which I have the feeling it was pre-made, because it came out way too soon.  (I really don't mind the wait people!)... at least it would've been HOT in the centre.  The size, texture & meat were alright though... left half the bun behind.
Tried the onion rings.  Way to GREASY, needs a better batter, method or oil to fry them in?.  I ended up removing the batter & eating just the onion... Oh joy!"}
{"text":"Wow I think I found a Diamond in the Rough here. I never have felt so welcome coming into a place let alone satisfied about the food. The quality of the food was a instant hit with me, and the group-on coupon that we used lowered the price point. overall this place is a five out of five for me. Staff was more then willing to keep you happy and the amount of food you get for the cost justified the price point. I have posted pics and I plan to go back again and again."}
{"text":"Really cool to be able to get free range, organic, locally sourced burgers, fries and beers.  But... well, the food's nothing spectacular.  The burger is on par with a Hero Burger or Acme Burger.  The poutine, while absolutely enormous in portion size and made with real (pressumably local, organic) cheese curds... was smothered in gravy that was pretty \"meh\".  So that was disappointing.

Like Acme and Hero Burger, the prices are mid-range.

Finally, if you are poor like me and never carry cash or a bank balance of more than $6.83... this place hasn't joined the 90s yet - NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED!  Yikes... I had to cross my fingers when I tried the debit card... don't know how it went through."}
{"text":"Awesome burger combo deals. A classic w/ onion rings and a pint!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger. Delicious poutine. Need I say more? Go there. Do it. DO IT NOW. I love that they offer daily burger and poutine specials. Quite a gem."}
{"text":"Hit up this spot for lunch today. There was a bit of a lineup but was pretty much in and out of there in 12 minutes(yes i timed it). 

I got a custom burger with spicy aoli, *balsamic fried onions*, goat cheese and tomato. The bun was flaky but not dry, large beef pattie wasn't overcooked and the toppings coming together just made it DIVINE. 

Definitely my new favourite burger spot in the city.

$9 without a drink or fries. 

And let me say this again: BALSAMIC FRIED ONIONS!"}
{"text":"Today I had many of the same issues others have written about. 

The ordering process is ridiculous and frustrating. It appears very little thought went into it. Seriously, ordering by saying what you DON'T want?!?! That's just a recipe for disaster... and that's exactly what it was. 

I ordered 4 burgers for take out for the family - the process of ordering is very lengthy: \"I would like a burger with no lettuce, no pickles, no hot peppers, no mushrooms, no mustard...\", you get the point (that was to order a burger with onions, mayo, and ketchup). Can you guess what happened? When I got home, I noticed that ALL FOUR burgers were wrong! Some had stuff I didn't want, some were missing things I wanted. Luckily between the four, we were able to swap toppings around to create some semblance of our actual order. 

The burgers were cooked nicely, not too overdone. The flavour was good - certainly nothing special. We really enjoyed the flavour of the fries although they were definitely too soft and somewhat greasy.

I won't be going back any time soon. I'll give them a chance to reorganize their methods and work out the kinks. I'll check them out again in a few months."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a few friends of mine.

I can't really speak for them but for myself, I had their Classic burger and a Mexican poutine that I shared with two others.

The burger: I ordered it with the typical fixings (minus the pickles). Found it to be fairly moist but very flavourful in terms of beef flavour. The interior of the beef only had a hint of pink however (I forgot to ask if they were able to cook to medium rare). I liked the use of the Ace bakery buns though.

Good news for former Lick's fans out there. One of my friends commented on how they tasted like Lick's burgers. This pretty much fell in line with what I had heard before about how they tasted like what Lick's burgers used to taste like BEFORE they went downhill.

The Mexican poutine: In a nutshell, it's the Fries Supreme from Taco Bell with better than average fries and guacamole instead of beef. Not too notable. 

Overall, a solid burger joint in an area that is pretty much full of nothing. 

A note for you vegetarians: Kat had asked me to ask them if their veggie burger was ready or not. They told me that they were still working on the recipe and couldn't say when it might be ready at all. Fear not however, there's always the portobello burger."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places when I feel a craving for burgers. The size of the patties are perfect, always done to perfection. The downside is the fact that they only serve one size of fries..... huge ....which is so dumb as if you are not in a group of three it's way too much for one person. They really need to offer a smaller size of all their assorted fries and they will make more money and keep customers like me happy ... otherwise you have to skip the fries when on your own :o("}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork and it was pretty good, lots of meat and a nice sauce, the bun was good too. I ordered fries with my sandwich and they were burnt; not even malt vinegar could save them."}
{"text":"This location is bigger than their original Gerrard store. With lots of seating (though the booths are tight!), this is a good space for groups and families.

While I enjoy the burgers at GBK (the voodoo is one of my favourites) their poutine is the better draw. I find the fries crisp on the outside and mashed-potato on the inside - perfect. Fries seem more consistent than the onion rings, so your mileage may vary, but both are good.

Their patties are (sadly) not gluten-free, but are really tasty. Prices are decent, though not cheap. GBK is my preferred burger joint in town these days."}
{"text":"Can I confess to a little bit of lunch-bag letdown? I went here last Friday night: very busy place! This is good. People are only going to line up for a great burger, right?

Ordered the Riverdale with a couple of extras recommended by a friend -- bacon and blue cheese. They've got an excellent list of toppings!

Ordered, paid, went outside to wait, went inside, waited a bit (observed what seemed to be a problem of the cashier not being certain of what was in each wrapped burger: ticketing system problems?).

Got my burger. It came wrapped, hot, with perfectly crisp bacon, delicious blue cheese with the right amount of saltiness, right amount of flinty flavour, sloppy GBK sauce, swiss cheese, and all the other ingredients that go to making up the Riverdale. 

The bun was a good bun: it did what a bun needs to do, which is hold the whole mess together and add a flavour that complements the burger and fixings. 

So why did I give them only 3 stars?

The burger itself. Cooked to greyness, a bit on the dry side. It wasn't that great of a burger. 

So I was a bit disappointed. I expected a burger that was going to at least be the equal of The Burger's Priest, because some reviews seem to put them neck-and-neck in the burger race. There's something about that loosely packed sloppy juicy burger at TBP that just wasn't equalled at GBK.

I'll have to try it again when it's not as busy, and I'll update."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and pouting. Had the special burger with Brie. Outstanding service. Everything made to order. Very unpretentious."}
{"text":"I agree with the majority of the other reviewers.  The food is just kind of decent and the prices are punitive.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you happen to be in the neighbourhood it's worth checking out (actually, if you're in the neighbourhood feel free to come by and we'll have a BBQ).

They also ask if you want to add a tip to your payment when you pay by credit card.  It's unclear to me what aspect of walking up the the counter to place my order, then picking it up myself when it's ready is tip worthy.  Actually, I think I should start a new list based on places that do this."}
{"text":"good burgers and reasonably priced - my \"go to\" place for burgers in the east end (much better than Burgers Priest, especially in terms of pricing).   Burgers and thick and juicy and fries are homemade and plentiful.  Make sure they don't overcook them, though - the tall guy with the beard tends to overdo the burgers.  Otherwise a great choice in the east end."}
{"text":"Burgers are mediocre, but I go for their poutines. Portion sizes are huge and you get a large box of fries slathered with gravy/toppings for a great price. However, once the fries start getting cold, they taste kind of sour with the gravy so try to finish fast or buy a box to share."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from here, and it is the default option when I don't feel like cooking. It's just SO good. 

I am vegetarian and absolutely love the Portabello burger - and I typically hate mushrooms. The combination of Portabello mushrooms, brie cheese, and grape tomatoes in a balsamic glaze is fantastic. That said, I tried the Veg burger and wasn't a big fan. It's a bit crumbly. It wasn't bad, just doesn't compare to the Portabello burger. 

Any meat-eater I know loves the place too. Poutine is good too. They even have amazing ice cream. 

It's not a cheap burger joint, but I think you pay for quality. Two burgers, fries, and drinks typically come to $19-22."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I cringed at the prices for a poutine and burger. I only came since my cousin insisted that we eat here and that the burgers were really good.

Man, am I glad that we came here. The burger was delicious and juicy! The 6oz patty was huge and for $6.95 + tax, you can add as many toppings as you like for no extra charge.

The Montreal poutine was a very good size. We ended up sharing it with 3 people in addition to our burgers.

The food here is really good, and the fact that it's organic makes it even better.

The only thing I would complain about is how long it took for us to get our food. It felt like a 20 minute wait and there was no one else ahead of us in the line. On the bright side, it made the meal that much more worthwhile since we were starving!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of burger places in Toronto and for the most part, I find them underwhelming - either patty's are too small or they're too greasy.  I like GBK (Jones & Gerrard) because they're a decent size and light on the grease... probably because, I think, they cook on a grill rather than a fry top.

The selection is ok but I'd like to see some new additions to the menu.  I always get the Riverdale and my wife, the Classic.  

I can't complain about the price as it seems inline with other places but still, two burgers and fries at around $25 is a lot."}
{"text":"I wish I loved the burgers here as it's in my neighbourhood, but I just don't think they're outstanding.   I will say that the rings and poutine (share it) are great and having the ice cream available is a nice touch.  They provide lettuce wraps for the burgers if requested which is also a nice touch and the staff are always friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I think i am on record as being a very big fan of the hamburger, and tend to eat more than my share recently, at least judging by the shape I have eaten myself into over the summer. there's just something about how perfect a Burger can be when its right.  there are a few places that absolutely strip it down to the core almost spiritual experience( read the Burgers Priest review) and those that elevate the burger to something exciting and trendy. 

GBK kind of squeaks by, and doesn't really make anything happen. I've been a few times, but just because its geographically the closet burger to my house, and I am very lazy, (which may also contribute to the new jeans I keep buying)  the burgers are decent, but predictable and safe, cooked pretty well, but i dont really think the value is comparable to the other people out there swimming in this pond. they also have a bunch of fancy poutines, but, again, they are okay, and nothing special. 

I really think they miss the mark on the lack of interesting drinks, as this is where I have my Jerry Mcguire moment usually.  as well, they dont recycle, which raises my cackles to 11.

So, if you happen to be nearby, and you are so hungry you cant go anywhere else, stop by."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Just moved to town and will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I just got back from trying out GBK on Church St. for the first time.  My daughter and I decided to order a Classic burger and a Chicken burger to share along with an order of fries.  I also ordered a Corona.  We were served by a young guy who also prepared our food.  My Corona was brought to me by an older man (maybe the owner?) as he was walking to the counter shoving the lime in getting his fingers all over it I thought it was a bit creepy but let that one go.  

We started eating and were quite enjoying our meal, both burgers were great and the fries were good too. Unfortunately I was facing the open kitchen and got to watch the Owner?? (not sure but gonna call him that for the rest of this story) mop the floor answer the phone, handle money and LICK HIS FINGERS while he prepared  food for the next customers order.  NO WASHING OF HANDS OCCURRED IN BETWEEN these activities.  Needless to say my enjoyment factor diminished after observing this.  

If I could be sure that the food handling skills improved I would go back here because the food was good and the staff was friendly.  Its a bit much to overlook that many infractions in such a short period of time."}
{"text":"best. burgers. ever. gbk made the first burger i sunk my teeth into once i moved to toronto 3.5 years ago and i have been a loyal customer ever since. if i'm not ordering the chicken burger wrapped in lettuce (vs having it in a bun), i will order the student burger - both of which are always moist, full of flavour and exactly what you expect to get out of satisfying comfort food.

i am also a poutine lover and gbk has the best poutine i have yet to try (better than anything i've had in montreal). i am a huge fan of their \"classic poutine\" - fresh had cut fries topped with cheese curds smothered in hot, rich, beef gravy that melts it all together. 

i always feel really good about dining here as they are huge advocates for fresh, local, and organic ingredients. the quality of their ingredients is evident in the excellence of the product they produce. side note: a number of their sauces are also made in house.

this is making me hungry. 

***suggestion: be sure to ask for a loyalty stamp card... you will be back! (10 stamps = free burger of your choice) ***"}
{"text":"Love the burgers, and I don't even LIKE potatoes, but I love their pulled pork/goat cheese poutine. SO good.

I found they burnt the bacon until I specifically said \"please don't make mine crispy.\" then it was perfect, so we're cool."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!

The pulled pork poutine (GBK poutine) is my favourite thing on the menu and it's my usual. Just so freaking tasty.

Burgers are really good too. The beef is so juicy and everything tastes as if it were made with love. Easily my favourite food place in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy gbk and love their gbk poutine (bbq sauce pulled pork, goat cheese.over fries) and I recommend eating at the location. However I am disappointed the last two times I've ordered the gbk poutine I've been severely shorted on sauce on my pulled pork, my reason for eating there. Great food but would check my order before I leave if I get take out again."}
{"text":"Last time I went to gbk, my bun was completely charred, all black. I asked them to replace the bun... So they replaced the top bun only and returned the burger to me without any toppings. Again I asked them to replace the charred bottom bun and they told me that is how serve their buns... Yes they said that they serve charred black buns on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I've had many burgers. I've tried those crazy burgers like Dangerous Dan's Quadruple C, the Burger Priests.. Don't remember what it was called and this place is hands down the best burger place I've had. The burger is tasty and fresh. Their poutine is flavourful and not overly cheesy. They put the right amount of gravy to make one of the best poutines in town. 
Their prices are very reasonable. I can never get it when I pay close to $20 for a burger, fries and drink. It's a burger combo for petes sake.
I will be dropping by quite often. My brother first recommended this place and now we both love it."}
{"text":"Just got done writing a mediocre review for another burger place and was reminded how wonderful the burgers are at GBK.  My wife and I have never been disappointed.  She particularly loves the option to have any burger they make in a lettuce wrap.  

Toppings galore, and if you're feeling adventurous, go for the burger of the day they have posted outside.  Sometimes intriguing, sometimes just totally random, but always good."}
{"text":"Great Burger Kitchen has a sign outside saying they are the \"purveyor of fine poutines.\" so i absolutely needed to try it! It is a small take out joint with a small counter to eat at in front of the window but not somewhere you would stay put for awhile! 
On the menu, there are 13 burgers to choose from boasting that all beef burgers are 100% Ontario beef and alternative  burgers including chicken, lamb, portobello mushroom and veggie.  They are affordable and the toppings are fresh and buns organic.
But come here for the french fries as a side and you get a huge plate of them for an extra $3.95 or as part of the combo.  They are well seasoned and there are tons of them so make sure you are sharing them!
There are seven types of poutine including a poutine du jour! All the regular bases are covered with a few compelling additions like the GBK poutine which has a bbq pulled pork and goat cheese topping ($7.25), Ontario - bacon, cheddar, onion and gravy ($6.95) and Greek poutine -feta, tomato, lemon oregano dressing, ($5.95).  I opted for a 'Montreal poutine' which was the traditional cheese curds and gravy poutine.  It was huge and amazing for the value.  I was happy that my cheese curds were chunky, the gravy wasn't too dark and too salty and the french fries still held their crunch!  I am definitely going back for more poutine."}
{"text":"Great burgers but pricey fries. Expect to wait a few minutes.

The food is great but I can't justify the price (it's easy to spend $14 for one person)."}
{"text":"I've been spoiling myself with burgers lately.

GBK may get lost in the shuffle between Big Smoke (formerly Craft Burger), Gourmet Burger Co., and Hero, but it can definitely hold its own within the group.  I had a Classic (hold the mustard & pickles) and an order of onion rings, and got a poutine to split as well.

The burger is a good size, not huge, but not tiny (I think the Classic is a 6oz?) and tasted good.  It may have been a little bit dry, but I think places like this just aren't allowed to serve food rare, so I can't really complain.  The onion rings were great, crispy and large, good amount of batter... but I think there were about 5 in the container.  They could use something bigger for rings and squeeze a few more in.  The poutine was quite good, and I like the fries here (I guess I tend to like them darker, rather than golden yellow).

Overall a very good option for a downtown burger if you want to go upscale from the typical fast food chains and get something a little more substantial."}
{"text":"Great Burger Kitchen? No, it's average at best. As a vegetarian I've only had the veggie burgers - the portobello burger is a sad excuse for a veggie sandwich. The mushroom is not a single mushroom but little bits piled on the bun. Cheaper that way I guess? The balsamic onions soak the whole bun and overwhelm everything. It turns the whole burger into a soggie mess. The veggie grain burger is no better. It looks like cat food and tastes like it."}
{"text":"gotta recommend this place. the chicken burger (with the usual fixin's plus the hot Niagara pickles!) was awesome but the onion rings were the real draw here. best i've ever had!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint. These are substantial burgers, and make no mistake - the pouting is not a side. It's huge. 

This place beats the burgers priest bloody. Taste, burger size, sitting room, and friendly staff put this place on top."}
{"text":"Tried three times and never enjoyed the burger. Wanted to so much because of location, but biting into the meat is like tasting the grill. Also - very dry and bland. Much too expensive for the quality served. Sorry GBK :("}
{"text":"I tried GBK as it was the closest burger shop that wasn't McDonalds still open after a shopping trip at Gerrard Square. I regret it, I will never go back, and I tell all of my friends to avoid it at all costs. 

I ordered a burger, fries, and a drink which cost a fortune. And then I waited. And waited. And waited.
While I was waiting the whole shop filled up with smoke - do they not have exhaust fans back there?

The service was mediocre, with the kitchen staff and the cashier literally shouting and swearing at one another. 

When the food finally came out I realized I had made a terrible mistake: the fries. There are so many, and they are so bad. I would not recommend ordering fries if you're craving a burger - I'm not sure who could ever eat that much food in one sitting.

The burger itself was pretty lame too. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. It gave me food poisoning, which had me bedridden for over a week.

The only thing I truly enjoyed was the (overpriced) Canada Dry Ginger ale I ordered.

Basically: don't waste your time. Hero burger does it far better."}
{"text":"The burgers are AWESOME!
The poutine is AWESOME!
The milkshakes are AWESOME!

Absolutely the best burgers I've had in Toronto.  The meat is good and slightly charred, the bun is classic, toppings plentiful and fresh.   I haven't tried the full gamut of different types of poutine they offer, so I have that to look forward to! (Greek poutine???  I can't wait!)

Sides should be shared, as the portions are so huge they're impossible to finish, and trust me, that comes from a man with a big appetite.   Also, be prepared to rush home and lie down after eating."}
{"text":"I am updating this to give them one more star as they redeemed themselves in my eyes last night. the SO and I went for chicken burger with wrap and some enormous double patty beef burger. Both good and fresh, and we had excellent customer service. Why only three stars? I cannot get past the fact that they do not recycle, or offer Whole Wheat buns. 

from my previous review

\" if you are going for \"consciousness\" whats with the plastic forks and the no recycling bin? It is NOT hard to wash forks, especially when four employees are hanging out in a completely empty restaurant when we are there. Throwing a pop can in the garbage sucks, honestly. ...

When your menu says \"We support a healthy, ethical, sustainable food culture\" I would really appreciate a real fork, and maybe some glasses with water jugs or something. Watching the employees go in the fridge, down a plastic bottle of something and then chuck it in the garbage is not getting me thinking sustainable. Neither is leaving behind two unused plastic forks, as we eat fries with our hands. \"

still stands."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here, particularly the poutine. The staff is friendly. I go when I can. It's not a long walk from Union Station."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers (pun intended) but do yourself a favour and have the poutine. So good. We hit this spot regularly."}
{"text":"ordered the voodoo burger and the patty was adequate but the rest was disgusting a waste of $10.00 and there were no fries with that.   M
any better burger places in the city."}
{"text":"People need to chill. 
I arrived here to order some food. One of the staff members was on the phone. I approached the counter and the lady told me \"Sorry, I'll be with you in just a moment\" Which was nice considering she was multitasking with the phone taking orders, taking orders from the kitchen, packing bags for delivery, and serving me and serving the sitting customers! This person is a champ. She deserves a medal. I don't know anyone else who would put up with hungry customers. I overhead her on the phone telling people \"Your order will take OVER AN HOUR\" and you have people complaining on here about waiting too long.
The food was OK. The kitchen prepared it fast. The fries were good. Heavy but good. I think she gave me free fries cause I waited. Sometimes you have to wait in life, go post a selfie. Seize the moment and eat a snack during peak hours."}
{"text":"As a contractor who gets to travel this fair city far and wide, GBK is perhaps my absolute favorite burger joint.  
Order yours medium and they're juicy and with just the right amount of seasoning and fresh, fresh toppings you just can't go wrong.  
They're onion rings are a little greasy but they're also HUGE."}
{"text":"At least twice a month, our family has been getting take out burgers from GBK since the moment they opened. We have always loved it and recommended it.
Last week we had a terrible experience for the first time. 
I have noticed how the staff have changed recently....not as friendly.
We ordered by phone and went down to pick up. 
When we got home with our food, we unwrapped the food to discover the burgers were like hockey pucks. Completely overcooked. There was no cheese on my burger like I'd ordered and it came on a bun - not in a lettuce wrap like we'd ordered. We ended up throwing them out.
It was late so I decided to call the next morning to talk to the manager instead of just writing a bad review.
When he answered the phone he said, \"ya?\" Is this the manager I asked. \"Ya\". Ok, I just wanted to let you know we had terrible burgers last night for the first time. \"And....?\" he says. And, I say, we are regulars and have never had this experience before....thought I'd let you know. 
Silence. 
Ummmm, I thought I'd let you know so you could maybe do some quality control.
Silence.
Hello? I said. \"Well, what do you want me to do about it? It's the next day. You should've called last night.\"
Well it was late and I'm calling now to tell you, I said.
\"Well I don't have the bill in front of me so there's nothing I can do.\"
What? I have the bill right here, do you want the receipt number?
\"Listen, it's your word against mine, I can't do anything...\"
What?!? Are you kidding me right now? I said. 
And it went on and on like that....until I hung up from frustration and disbelief. 
I don't even know what to say except, we are never going back."}
{"text":"Love ordering from here as a treat if I am craving a burger and maybe fries. The delivery times have always been incredibly fast (through Just Eat). I recommend the Great Burger for the very hungry. Mmmmmm.... The fries are always crispy as they should be. I've also had the mushroom swiss and Montreal poutines, which are good too. I don't think I've noticed much difference between the Norwich Farms premium beef and the regular beef. I haven't asked for a specific temperature on my burger, but if I did, I would ask for it less well done. I don't know what else to say - it's a burger joint selling very good burgers."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. I thought it was going to be \"great\" like the name implies, but it wasn't even close.

I ordered for delivery, and order the basic burger with my toppings. When my food arrived and I started eating the burger, I realized as I got closer to the middle, it was undercooked. I know that some places cook their burgers a little under, pink, it makes sense, but in this case, it was RAW in the middle. I called the location to inform them that they sent me a raw burger. They were very friendly about it, which was nice, and they offered to resend the burgers in my order (boyfriends was raw too). So we waited another 45 minutes before our new burgers arrived, only to find, again, the burgers were RAW in the middle. We didn't bother to make a second call and just ate the fries. 

We have not ordered again since and don't plan to anytime soon. 
Maybe a visit to the restaurant might be different but we're not sure we want to take that chance."}
{"text":"I had a really great burger today. It was charbroiled nicely but moist/not overcooked on the inside. I added some guacamole to the daily special - which also included their special sauce and caramelized onions.  It was sort of pricey - I think the total was ~15$ for burger, fries, and a bottle of water. 

The pile of fries was more than enough for two people - and my quite ethnic friend had the chicken burger. He liked that a lot, but then again he's never had a hamburger. Crazy, huh? Oh well, it takes all kinds."}
{"text":"Still excellent...and so many burgers later.  Now I read all the vegans running out to try veggie burgers that don't want this and that...it's a burger house.  You want a salad that looks like a burger, then go to...wait, the vegetarian place in Leslieville closed.  Sorry.  

This place is a keeper.  The guy that walked in behind me tonight couldn't decide...he said there's so much to choose from."}
{"text":"My buddy has been raving about this lace, and since he was driving I figured I'd go. They do burgers, fries and rings. GOOD! No messing around with chicken fingers,hot dogs etc. Burgers are made fresh,and they are tasty and juicy. The taste kind of reminded me of what a Lick's burger was like years ago. I also had a poutine which for me stole the show, I couldn't even finish it. I put that they had waiter service.Not so much, I placed my order at the counter, but food was brought to me, I only had to get up for me drink. Oh they also have home made shakes."}
{"text":"Came in to purchase a student burger and poutine.  Asked them to add spicy aioli  red onions and honey mustard extra on top of the burger i got . Got take out and brought it home only to find the stuff i asked to be extra to be on top to be the only things on the burger..."}
{"text":"If I were a local, there is no doubt that I would give this place a second chance.  Unfortunately I'm on vacation and it's a one shot deal.  Incidentally, this place would kill in Los Angeles.

Groupon was kind enough to introduce me to this place, which was within walking distance from our hotel.  The prices are comparable with the upscale burger places in Los Angeles.  When you want a fresh burger with quality ingredients, you're not going to pay Big Mac prices.

My major complaint here is that my burger was overcooked.  I liked the char flavor on the outside, but I prefer the inside of my burger to be more red, juicy, most, and bloody.  Perhaps I should have spoken up and said so when I ordered, but it really didn't occur to me that I'd need to.  The Montreal Poutine was good, if not a little bit salty, but I think that just must be the nature of the dish."}
{"text":"This summer I am on quest for finding the best burger in town, I decided to hit up Great Burger Kitchen (GBK) for lunch.

I got there at 11:30am and the place was deserted, I guess it is a bit too early for a burger.  I order an original burger with GBK sauce, a greek salad (I know I was anti-fries that day) and a Corona (this is where the extra calories went).  The burger was massive, it was tough to hold together when I hunched over for my big bite.  After my first bite, I could tell the patty was frozen.  :(  Overall, a descent burger but not the best.

The greek salad was a hit, right amount of tomatoes to feta.  

Bill was under $20 - I think the beer was what did me over.

If you are in the St Lawrence market area, stop by for a burger, they are worth a try."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place out and OMG am I glad I did. 
Chris and Andy are so friendly. All the staff look happy to be here. The store is clean and THE FOOD!!!!!!! My husband and I shared the Ontario poutine. This was the best poutine I've had in a long time. I had the burger of the day and my husband had the Tasty Burger.  I couldn't believe how tasty the homemade patty was. The meat  was so juicy and flavorful. I am definitely coming again.  So happy my husband brought me here.  Oh.. and I can't forget to mention the milkshake!! This place has everything!  Love love love it here!!!!  I will definitely be back with many friends!!!"}
{"text":"Burnt burgers, I wonder if they're trying to hide certain flavours or lack of flavours. A combo runs you over $12 for greasy fast food. The fries were wetly soaked in oil, the menu says double fried for crispiness, it wasn't crispy! Overall, decent food, stick with the burgers and ask them not to char it."}
{"text":"i must love burgers, went back on saturday with my son and a friend they had two student burgers and montreal poutine, i got the daliy combo  burger with fries and a drink.  The burgers were ok this time and i did bring home half of mine and the fries for the teenager asleep at home.  I'm thinking I may be a creature of habit because it was ok nothing great this time.  After reading the reviews for the Burger Priest, I think a must try them.  I didn't realize I liked burgers soo much until I saw how many times I've been going there.  This has to stop.  $35.76 including tax ( a bit steep)"}
{"text":"Burgers are the right size but the buns are bigger.   The Student Burger is the smallest but it's the same size as my Greek Burger?!"}
{"text":"I walked in here based on the good look of the sign outside and the amount of people inside waiting for food. The menu looked great, so I figured I'd give it a try. 

Classic burger with cheese and bacon.. amazing! Huge, fresh veggies, everything about it was awesome. SO worth the $7+.

The poutine on the other hand, did not impress. The fries looked like their fryer oil hasn't been changed this year and tasted equally as unfortunate. The gravy and cheese is decent, and the quantity was worth $5.25, but the taste was not. Sad. Poutine is my very favourite.

I'd likely give them another try if I don't find another epic place for burgers in the area.

I did notice they have a blue recycling bin for bottles now - another Yelper had mentioned the lack of."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Didn't even bother to eat their food.  

Found them through their website.   The site shows a huge comfortable dining area.  Was looking for a comfortable spot to have a great burger with my family.   We drove 40 minutes to give this spot a shot.   

Walked in.   They have only 8 stools at a window bar.  Not a comfy dining room.  I asked the cashier if I was in the wrong place and mentioned the website.   She said \"ahhh.  Yeah.  The website does show fake pictures\".   

So I wonder if the pics of the food are fake too?  Or maybe all the positive reviews here are fake?   

Liars.  Sorry.  Can't support them.   Not cool at all."}
{"text":"My wife and I went today (Sunday) and got there just after 1.  All the stools were taken (2 by people waiting for their take-out), but by the time our food was ready, there was lots of room.

My wife had the classic burger (combo, we shared the fries) and I had the chicken burger (it's a grilled breast, not ground chicken burger).  A can of pop came with the combo, and I had a bottle of pop.  $25 on the nose before taxes.

The menu lists a different condiment combination for every burger (i.e. the chicken burger comes with green onion aioli, grilled red peppers and balsamic grilled onions).  They are happy to make substitutions, as both my wife and I requested.  They got both our orders wrong, but were happy to correct them.  They also got the order wrong for the customers who followed us.  Why don't they just offer all the burgers plain, and let the customer indicate preferences?

Anyway, we were both quite satisfied with our meals.  The fries were high-quality, but could have been a little crisper...they were a tad oily.  The chicken breast was great, and the green onion aioli was very tasty.  My wife liked her burger, but told me it wasn't as good as my sister's home made burger.

I hope I don't sound too negative.  I DID give them 4 stars.  I actually hope the owners of establishments like this check out Yelp to see what their customers are saying.

This is another \"fast food\" place that cares about their ingredients (see Chipotle Mexican Grill).  Naturally raised beef, free-range chicken, organic buns etc.  I'm enjoying this trend."}
{"text":"After being out of the country for 3 years coming back to find out that great burger kitchen is not only still around but improved with age was a great surprise. Got the Greek burger and onion rings and can say this hit the spot. The rings are better then ever and the burger was perfect. Nice and juicy, perfectly cooked. Quick and friendly service. If you want a good burger and good service go here"}
{"text":"Very good burger, bun was exceptionally fresh and made the burger even more of a stand-out then your regular gourmet burger places.  Nice variety of toppings and choice to suit any palate.   Tried the Ontario Poutine without onions, good but very salty.  Good thing this place is licensed."}
{"text":"I love GBK! The burgers and fries are super tasty. Pick you own toppings and the toppings are fresh. The beef is delish and the fries are sooooooo damn good! The staff is fantastic, friendly and the food comes out super fast and hot. The prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food you get. If I could, I would pitch a tent on the floor of GBK and live there."}
{"text":"Great Burger Kitchen

I must preface this by saying that I have never treated this place more than a take-out restaurant. Although She and I dined in once, the space only offers stools and a counter top. 
With that being said, this place is a PERFECT take-out burger joint to have in your area. Ever since I was young I have set myself on a mission to try as many different burger places in Toronto and GBK can dance with the best of them. They offer two different types of meat for their burgers. Both options are fantastic but for a few extra bucks you can treat yourself to their \"premium beef\" option. There are a few specialty burgers such as Greek burger (tomatoes, feta cheese, and psuedo-authentic taziki sauce). My personal favourite is the Tasty burger which is a cheeseburger topped off with pulled pork. If you're a control freak, you also have the option to create your own burger. The second phase of your meal is one of their delightful poutines. They have daily specials and plenty of specialty poutines that can meet anyone's standards. And last but not least, you MUST treat yourself to a cone or a shake at GBK. They are one of few places in the East end that serves Kwartha ice-cream. It is some of the best made ice-cream in all of Canada. Overall, GBK is a great experience. The food and the staff are all on point."}
{"text":"Mediocre burger, terrible fries.  I wouldn't go back. 
Onion rings are not good.  Super battered and greasy."}
{"text":"I have walked passed this place several times as its in the path of my regular grocery run. The sister concern of Hanks is usually packed on weekends with the brunch crowd as its right on the street while I never ventured in to this burger joint so didn't know what to expect. 
I am not a burger aficionado by any means though I can tell when I have had a decent one. So with a physically gruel weekend I decided to reward myself and have a burger. This place was nearby and even had Yelp app promo combo of classic burger and beer so I decided to try it out. I did upgrade the meat to the organic version and chose Corona as the poison of choice. 
The burger looked OK visually, served old style in a tray on paper.  Now for the taste meh it was just bone dry. Devoid of proper seasoning and the bread to meat ratio was off IMO. Just too much bread and condiments overwhelmed the already over cooked meat. This is by no means a gourmet burger and one is better of getting a whopper. 
2 Stars."}
{"text":"I've hit this place up several times as I used to live in the St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood. 

The burgers are fresh and delicious, probably as good as they get. Their pulled pork is also money!  If you order a side of fries or rings, remember that they are very large and can be easily shared by two ppl (and I have a voracious appetite!). As an added bonus, they also sell beer.

Having tried pretty much most creations on their menu (voodoo burger, prolly my fav off their menu) and some of their daily specials, I needed something more! So what I do? Get the staff to make me whatever they feel like. I've had some wild burgers this way and I would suggest you try it if you are daring! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Burger Kitchen ain't so \"great\". It should be called \"So-so Burger Kitchen\". I read about it in eye or now magazine and had high expectations. The veggie burger had so much potential to be good. I spotted some beans and quinoa in the mix. What was missing was flavour. It was a bit too mushy for my liking too. 
For $7, you kind of expect more out of a veggie burger. The upside is that it wasn't just a Yves veggie patty but if they just threw in something like salt, maybe I'd be enticed to try it again."}
{"text":"The burger at this place was very juicy and great, the poutine was quite salty but they had a lot of options for toppings for both. It's a good place to go for a quick dinner. The service was friendly but it is a small place so you may not want to go with a lot of people. The burger I had was delicious and will go again. It had an old fashioned diner vibe which made it feel cozy."}
{"text":"Disgusting and dripping with grease! I ordered onion rings and chicken burger.... onion rings were drenched in oil. They weren't drained after frying, and I suspect were sitting in oil. Inedible. The entire paper bag, as well as my own bag was covered in grease. The chicken burger lacked flavour (where was green onion aioli?)"}
{"text":"I am pulling my hair out with this burger joint, I swear...

We went there for lunch yesterday.
I ordered the Classic Burger (lettuce, tomato, red onion, ketchup, mustard & pickles) + mushrooms, cheddar cheese and GBK sauce for my husband and a Custom Burger with lettuce, red onion, mushroom, Swiss cheese and GBK sauce for me.
Unfortunately they didn't get either one right.
My husband was missing the lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard and pickles. My burger came without the lettuce.
We were not impressed.

I don't understand how this can happen.
It's just 2 burgers, not even that big order I was telling you guys about last time.
I LOVE their burgers, but they can't get the orders right. 
It is just so annoying.."}
{"text":"Expensive designer burgers on a dingy congested strip of Gerrard Street East is not  a recipe for success, and my first visit is likely to have been my last.  My excitement to see an upscale burger place in Riverdale turned into disappointment.  Burger was decent, but not as good as other upscale burger joints in the city like Craft Burger.  At $5.95 for a burger (w/o cheese) + $3.95 for fries + taxes, it's over $11.00 for a burger and fries, and they're not worth it.  While staff were pleasant and efficient on my visit, I'd rather get souvlaki on the Danforth in a nicer environment and get a bigger and better take out meal for a similar price.  Cash only.  Napkins are brown paper towel sheets like you get at a gas station."}
{"text":"Place is small, cozy with friendly staff. 
There's a large variety of choices that would allow you to get the burger that you are craving for.
All their meat is locally sourced, naturally raised and comes from a free range type of concept (so they state). 

Just had a simple 6oz burger with spicy aioli, jalapeño peppers and Brie cheese. 
The burger took approx 7 mins to be served which is good waiting time for a good healthy sandwich. 

The burger is of a good size and it was very tasty. 

I would surely come back again to try a full menu with a milkshake to gurgle down my throat."}
{"text":"This place has lots of potential.  Based on the bite I had, the meat burgers seem very good.   The buns are good and the topping selection is great.   Fries are made with high quality potatoes and are perfectly crisp.  So why only three stars?

Well, as another reviewer said, the veggie burger is mushy and tasteless.  I looked for the various ingredients that Kat mentioned in her review, but it was just a grey mass like newspaper pulp.  The menu showed \"new\" beside the veggie offering, so maybe the veggie burger isn't what it used to be.  

Also, while the fries are made from great potatoes and cooked to perfect crispiness, they had that taste of old oil that dominates flavours and lingers in your mouth.  I think the oil was overdue for replacement, but I'm not a deep fry expert so maybe there's another reason."}
{"text":"I went here while I was out for the Brew Benefit Dishcrawl. Now, before I start to slander GBK, I have to mention that I was at GBK before the event started. The place was not packed and I was there with two other people. This place, was by no means, busy. 

Ok, now let's get down to business:

1) The service here is horrid. The young man at the cash seemed like he hated his life. There are really some people that shouldn't be working in the customer service industry... and he was definitely one of those people. He seemed very flustered and just so out of it. He wouldn't stop b*tching about how everything was so disorganized and he seemed very frustrated that he had to give out 5oz samples of beer (we were really supposed to get 12oz samples, but hey, who's counting?). He was rather frustrated that I was also BUYING the $5 food special for the event. Seriously? I could be really douchey and just run away with my free beer, but I ALSO bought the $5 special. Like, get over yourself. When I went to sit down, his co-workers came out and he continued to b*tch about how his life sucked and how much the day was going to suck. Tip: if you're going to b*tch, don't do it loudly around food bloggers because it will bite you in your sorry a** later :D

2) The food wasn't even that good. I ordered the beer braised chicken poutine. Now, I love anything that's unhealthy and salty and gooey and full of cheese... it's my guilty pleasure and part of the reason why I spend half of the day at the gym, but this poutine was gross. People should be aware of how salty something is before putting it out. There's a very fine line between good salty and just too salty... and this poutine was TOO salty. Salt on the fries (way too much salt on the fries), too much salt in the gravy, and hard cheese curds. (gross)

After being here once, I really won't be back. It didn't blow my mind or anything and the guy at the cash kinda ruined it for me. Sry GBK... you flopped this time."}
{"text":"The best way to rate this place is to break it up- if a delicious moist BEEF burger is what you are looking for then this is NOT the BEST place.  But if you are going to go for an all-round place then it is A-OK

Veggie burger (not the portobello burger): Quinoa and black bean based.  Falls apart easily..dry..not that good.  2 stars

Regular burgers: Can be dry.  Not very consistent.  Even when it's done well it's just alright. 2.5-3 stars

Bun- Too much bun and not delicious tasting.  Weird big bread kind of option..toasted on the grill but just not very good.  I always have to remove some bun to get a proper meat-bun ratio. 1-2 stars

Topping options: Many free, many delicious 4 star

Service with a smile: 4-5 star 90% of the time.  10% of the time 1 star (some inconsistency on staff.  Daytime staff are a LOT better than nighttime staff)

Burger Peripherals?: Poutine, Onion Rings and BEER- Solid 4 stars.

{"text":"I'll start with some context -- there isn't a lot of restaurants to speak of on Gerrard in the area.  Nestled between Gerrard Square and Little India, there's very little competition in the area.  You could get fast-food at Gerrard Square, head down to Chinatown East, Little India, Queen Street, or the Danforth, but within a five minute walk, there's very little else worth eating.  That's a promising start.

On my first visit, I had checked out the menu in advance and brought my wife, a vegetarian who doesn't like mushrooms, only to discover that their non-mushroom vegetarian burger is still getting refined, and they're not ready to sell it.  Awkward first visit.  The second visit was better, my mother came along and we had two Riverdale burgers and split a Montreal Poutine, all of which was enjoyable.  The fries tasted like they'd be good without curds and gravy, but I'll have to try them straight before I can really comment.  Basically, we enjoyed the food, an above-average burger and fry.

I find the decor pleasant, although it's a pretty spartan place.  It's small, with a little bar along two walls, could probably seat 10-15 comfortably.  The area in front of the counter is open and spacious, but can get crowded.  We arrived at 11:30 on a Friday, ordered in peace, but shortly thereafter the restaurant was swamped by students for half an hour, ordering their food to go.  This is good for the restaurant, but does encourage you to consider taking your food to go if you might find yourself in a waiting room shortly.

They have a menu of preconfigured burgers, fries, and poutines, as well as a fair amount of flexibility in configuring your own options.  It seems like they're still working out the kinks in the ordering process, it's still a little clumsy and error-prone, but it's still early days, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

In summary, I think this is a promising new entrant in the neighbourhood, good food, reasonable prices, but they're still definitely working out the kinks."}
{"text":"Totally solid burger.  Good ingredients, and generally well-cooked.  Only two complaints: 1) I wish they would make the burgers a little less well-done.  New staff is overcooking them.  2) They have this poutine that has awesome potential, with bacon and cheese and raw onion.  Why not sautee or carmelize the onion?  Raw onion is way too harsh a flavour for mellow potato, cheese and gravy.  Totally overpowers it."}
{"text":"Great gourmet burgers - fantastic juicy flavour with the burger.  I've been here twice and have had the riverdale burger both times (6.95) - honey mustard, tomato, lettuce, and onions.
I think one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto.
Where I think they could improve is their poutine, it was quite soggy and drenched in oil.  I don't think I would get the poutine again.  The onion rings were much better though, still very oily, but crispy and huge.

It is a bit more expensive than usual (about $12.00 for a combo with the burger, onion rings, and a coke).  They give a $1 discount for combos.
Also, they have daily groupon deals $14 for $7, which is much more reasonable.  I'd like to come back soon."}
{"text":"We ordered last night for delivery, the customer service was great & delivery took less than 30 minutes. The portion sizes are huge, I would recommend sharing sides."}
{"text":"This burger design facility produces one of my three FAVORITE BURGER on the planet!
It is the Classic Burger (lettuce, tomato, red onion, ketchup, mustard & pickles) 
+ mushrooms, avocado!, cheddar cheese and GBK sauce.

5 stars for the burger! Fantastic!

Unfortunately, the fries are too dark and soggy. Not worse than most places but not good enough for me to eat them. The poutine makes it even worse.
My personal preference are crispy and golden fries.

The missing complementing side dish drops my rating down to 4 stars.

I usually just get the burger to enter food heaven."}
{"text":"If you are pressed for time, don't eat here.  From the time I ordered, it took 15 minutes to prepare my burger (and they had 3 hands on deck in the kitchen).

I got their Classic Burger and found it to be a bit on the dry side.  

As far as gourmet burger places go, this place doesn't wow and for what they're charging I could find better burgers elsewhere without it cutting into my precious lunch break.

For those of you who do lunch meetings, they do have a great deal:
10 burgers
10 fries
10 drinks
$100 all in.  Pick up only though.

My word of advice?  Call in your order."}
{"text":"This place has the best burger I have ever had in my life and I mean it! The burger tastes truly homemade so surpasses any other gourmet burger places. I believe it is because of the ingredients they use. What adds value to the tasty and healthy burger is the bun--is it of great quality and really makes every bite so enjoyable. I like the Riverdale with mushrooms. Their fries are also great!"}
{"text":"The slogan is really good and probably true. GKB has one most juicy and tasty burgers. The Church location close earlier this year and I had so many times to go but I guess it better late then never.

The patty was 6 oz for 10 buck plus topping was a good deal. Moist, juicy and so favourful. If organic then even better. Definity one of my favourites now. I will be back."}
{"text":"Huge onion rings; huge portion!!!!! Great tasting chicken burgers!   I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They have tremendous service, thats fast and friendly. The vegetarian burger is so delicious as well as the fries (for any veg heads out there). I would highly recommend this place for a quick yummy lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of GBK, I like the atmosphere, the burgers are tasty but i have to say the best thing about the place is the fries. I was there two weeks ago and I usually only get a burger but I was in the mood for some greasy carbs, and went for a side of fries. The portion was huge. I can honestly say I would have been happy with the fries alone, although I enjoyed the burger too. 

I would give four stars, except that the cashier was cold as ice. When you work in customer service, you have to smile and say thank you, and/or you're welcome."}
{"text":"I split a veggie burger and a Mexican Poutine from Great Burger Kitchen with my girlfriend last night.
The meal seemed over priced for what we got.  
The veggie burger was good, but i prefer the veggie burgers at Licks. 
The poutine was good for what it was...  I would have rather of tried the \"montreal poutine\" but the gravy they use at GBK isn't vegetarian friendly. 

Overall i'd say it was worth checking out but I can't see it ever being my go to place for veg burger or poutine."}
{"text":"If you are looking to purchase a veggie burger, don't bother. It's not a meat-simulated burger as it is made with beans and the lettuce bun is just ridiculous. I just wanted a burger that tasted like the rest and instead I get a whole head of lettuce like I'm a rabbit. Thankfully I didn't get a combo or I would have paid close to $16 that would have just ended up in the garbage. Instead, I just threw away $10 in the garbage. Ridiculous. Never coming back."}
{"text":"By way of a bit of background, if you're a Danforthian, a Leslievillian or a Beacher, you've had occassion to be near or around the intersection of Gerrard and Jones, usually to drive through it to get to the Danforth or to Queen Street. Am I right or am I right? 

There's nothing much in the way of restaurants nearby to this intersection except a McDonalds (I use the term restaurant loosely), many Asian-inspired restaurants which keep strange hours and are boarded up and replaced with other Asian-inspired restaurants often. Then there is a highschool, a Pizza Pizza and a Smoker's Mart. I suspect it's some kind of variety store which sells fried chicken, though I have not been inside. 

I give kudos to anyone with the strength to open a brand new restaurant in a run-down part of down. I know Gerrard and Jones is working towards a Queen Street East or Danforth-style visage. That said, you can't tear all of the houses and buildings down and though it's blocks away from two lovely parts of town, it's a totally different machine and it's been overlooked for a long time. 

That said, Great Burger Kitchen is always busy. People know about it and they go. They pay the $11 some-odd dollars for a burger. Many reviewers of this restaurant have commented on the price. To clarify, while the burgers may be more expensive than your run-of-the-mill burger, they offer beef, chicken and veggie burgers. The meat is ethically and locally raised and the buns are delivered daily from the nearby Brick Street Bread shop. The toppings selection is unlike what you would find anywhere else and the burgers are superior in taste. I give kudos to any new business willing to support established local ones as part of their day-to-day business dealings. I think that's what neighbourhoods like Leslieville and the Danforth are all about. 

Many reviewers have also complained about the wait. Just because this isn't a typical restaurant (i.e. with seating other than some bar stools around the window area) doesn't mean that beef and chicken don't take time to cook. This isn't McDonalds where the ...ahem...beef is cooked in advance and waiting in a warming tray for the convenience of our nano-second society. It's real meat and it takes time to cook. 

The fries as a sidedish or as a poutine (of which there are many varities to choose from) are pretty good. The serving size is a bit excessive, but not overpriced considering the volume. 

Long story short, GBK is a great local establishment and I always root for the little guy. I hope they continue to enjoy success because I think they deserve it. I also note that after the inception of GBK, many other burger places have opened relatively nearby, likely on the heels of GBK's success. 

Give it a try, but remember, you'll have to wait if you don't want undercooked beef, bring more than $5 for your meal and enjoy!"}
{"text":"One phrase and one phrase only: Pulled Pork Poutine with Goat Cheese.

I'm embarrassed to say how many times I hit this place up while I was pregnant. Too many. TOO MANY. Their poutine's are hands down one of the best things I've put in my mouth - and I put a LOT of things in my mouth.

Yea I said it."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful or two times and there's no reason I won't visit again if I'm hungry and in the area.

The burgers are great, and I've never had a bad order of fries.

GBK Poutine is my favourite from there, Mexican is pretty good, and Mushroom Swiss is also nice. I personally didn't enjoy the Ontario Poutine, but there was nothing wrong with it.

I've had the Voodoo, Greek, and Riverdale burgers, plus some custom topped burgers, and I've tasted the chicken and veggie burgers. All of the burgers were above average (other than the few with errors) and the chicken and veggie burgers were well made.

I tried the onion rings once but I never considered getting them again, so I can only assume they weren't very good.

Out of the many burgers I've received, one of them was really bad and one or two had minor issues (wrong toppings or something). The really bad one was a Voodoo Burger that was 90% balsamic onions that just looked like they were dumped on the burger along with the juices they were stewing in, there were almost no other toppings on the burger. Unfortunately, I couldn't make a complaint since it was a takeout order near the end of the day. Regardless, that's one bad burger out of the many burgers I've received from them."}
{"text":"Had their special burger which had an egg in it. I realize I wasn't asked how the egg was cooked but it was over easy and that's how I wanted it anyways haha. I wish I got the poutine like everyone was saying but that will happen next time. The burger itself had some nice fresh ingredients and I love the way the shop itself is set up. The meat was solid as it was still greasy but I didn't hate myself right after. I'll definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"As part of my \"Eating Toronto Tour\", I really really wanted a burger; so went to the GBK on Church.
Place looked nice and clean and had a great selection of burgers and poutine.
I ordered both the Portabello Burger and the Lamb burger (yes, I was hungry), along with their mushroom poutine. My cousins ordered a reg burger.
My Portabello Burger: an actual grilled Portabello mushroom with brie cheese. That was really really good and juicy.
Lamb burger: lamb patty with goat cheese. That was a disappointment... the meat was super dry and lacked flavor.
The buns use for the burgers was too thick and dry.
The mushroom poutine came with 2 slices of Swiss cheese - not good! The fries were overcooked, the gravy was super salty and the cheese was like WTH?
I guess, it's a good place if you don't want fast food type of burger, but I would not go back for a \"true specialty burger\" place."}
{"text":"Voodoo burger & onion rings, yum!

It seems that everyday there's a new \"gourmet\" burger place popping up in Toronto and being a burger lover I don't mind trying them all. 

Great Burger Kitchen does make a great burger. Overall it was an enjoyable burger experience. The food was good, prices were reasonable ($12 something for a quality burger & onion rings), and service was friendly. 

Their patty was seasoned well, though maybe a bit too well if your a purist and just like meat, salt & pepper. I tasted a slight garlic/onion flavor in the patty which I didn't mind. And the patty had the texture of real meat (not a lot of filler), and was a decent size patty. 

I got the voodoo burger w onion rings. The voodoo burger was topped with salsa, spicy mayo, guacamole, balsamic onions & lettuce. Overall it tasted good, not sure all the ingredients were necessary as some items overwhelmed others but it was enjoyable and I ate it all. The salsa was a bit runny so I'd probably omit that next time because it made the whole thing really messy to eat. 

The onion rings were well prepared, not too greasy, well seasoned, and the onion didn't just pull out when you bite into it. 

The one thing that did bug me about this place is I used to work at Gourmet Burger Kitchen in the UK, also called GBK and the design of the menu is almost identical to the old UK GBK menu (I think they've since changed it), though the menu items are different. If they are trying to mimic UK GBK I have no complaint but wish they'd bring over some of the good burgers like the avocado bacon, or aubergine & goat cheese and some of their signature sauces."}
{"text":"If I had the option to give no stars, I would. My friends raved about this place and we ordered dinner from here at around 7.30 pm this evening. No sign of the food until 9 pm. When we called, we were told that the order has been put through. 
Hungry, we waited until 9.40 for our food. When we called again, the person on the other end of the line was extremely rude and uncouth. I understand being busy this time of the year. Don't appreciate being lied to about the wait time and even less, the rudeness. I'm sure there are better burger places in the area. I'm taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yeah, the buns often come toasty-grilled, but oh my, are the burgers huge! The poutines here are huge and greasy-good!

If you really want to knock yourself out, try a 'Mexican Poutine'--like a nachos plate in the form of a poutine. Or their GBK poutine--mmm, pulled pork and goat cheese...

I haven't the chance to try 'em all yet. But the burger patties are very nicely thick (what a difference 6 ozs make), and has a decent grilled backyard taste. And best of all, at $6-12 for a single item or a meal combo respectively, much of the grub at GBK are relatively affordable by local 'gourmet' burger standards. Albeit, it's pricey from a high-schooler-buying-lunch-across-the-street perspective. (And thus I wonder how busy the place is with teenagers at lunch hour--indeed, with the slow seeming gentrification of the anonymous Gerrard-Jones block, the pool of cheap-though-not-necessarily-good lunch options as I remembered it are shrinking... but lest I digress.)

As a consolation to the above point, there is a 4oz 'student burger' on the menu. There's also a small ice cream bar, though seating options are limited to bar counters running two sides of the service space. Ya know, it would be decent to provide a coat hanging solution so one wouldn't have to eat in while wearing a thick winter jacket. (But lest I digress again.)

They strive to made good comfort grub with local ingredients, whereas I strive to consume big burgers and creative poutine ideas. I'm quite impressed with GBK.

{TTC: the 83 or 506 to Gerrard and Jones. GBK is smack next to McGugan's pub at the northwest quadrant.}"}
{"text":"We grabbed two burgers here today - the daily special (topped with brie, and feta, lettuce, tomato, onion, and GBK sauce (and maybe something else - I can't completely remember).  Also had an order or poutine and onion rings.

The burger was massive.  The poutine was massive - a little light on gravy, but otherwise ok.  I will likely pass on the onion rings next time (the ones at BQM are better, and these are battered with some weird \"fish&chips\" type batter, which I can to do without.

Next time, I split a combo with someone...b/c I only ate half anyway.

Eat here if hungry..."}
{"text":"Veggie Burger lovers be on the lookout for this place!

2 great options for you:

Option 1) This ain't no standard patty... it's huge, it has quinoa in it and it's darn tasty! Plenty of sides you can add to it including the sauteed mushrooms or onions and 4 different cheeses!

Option 2) A sloppy but delicious portobello mushroom and brie burger... Huge on taste!"}
{"text":"I give this place only 3 stars because it's horribly inconsistent and burns the burgers to a crisp...  Really sucks getting home and unpacking a burnt burger.  Otherwise it would be a great burger joint with excelled poutine and onion rings."}
{"text":"Excellent.

Fresh food, large portions, reasonable prices, organic buns, and ethically raised beef from local farms.

They make a very tasty burger."}
{"text":"What a fantastic surprise! My husband and I needed a quick dinner one Saturday night and wanted to try something in the neighbourhood. We ordered two Riverdale burgers to go. WOW! This has to be one of the better burgers I've had in the city and for such a reasonable price for what you get. 

The quality is way above fast food burgers. The meat is organic, the toppings are fresh, but most importantly it's delicious! You get a great portion for what you pay for in both burger and fries. Generally, one order of fries and two burgers is more than enough to feed us both. 

The staff is also super friendly and cool which is always a plus. 

Highly recommended for a fast, delicious meal."}
{"text":"Love this place when it was at church and front. Fresh burgers made to order. So make sure to have time during your work lunch as the wait can be 10+ minutes. The fries are double fried for extra crispiness which is worth the visit. I've yet to visit the newer location but will when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This was a great place for burgers and my first try of Poutine Fries!!! The chicken burger was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"After a terrible delivery and customer service due to cc machine problems the manager credited me the meal after I complained 

The food is good and I'm glad the problem was resolved. I will continue to give them my business"}
{"text":"Couple days i go I had there fries,I couldn't finish of yet,I had finish them of because I didn't want waste food.I had burger classics  was good just was second time.it good food"}
{"text":"Decent prices for Frankenstein burgers, considering that most places in Toronto would be more than happy to gouge you for the local-sourced premium alone.

I've been there 3 times now and will make a more valiant effort to keep it up, but only if the cook continues to beatbox dubstep haphazardly."}
{"text":"Truthfully this is a 3.5/5. Expensive, but great for a treat. Their voodoo burger is delicious and they make a good veggie, too. I am slowly eating my way through the menu here because I live around the corner and I haven't had a disappointing meal yet. 

Accessibility is very poor: stairs up to door, no washroom."}
{"text":"Solid if you're craving a burger or poutine in the area. I would choose the poutine over the burgers, but if you have the stomach, get both!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, so please understand that I still come and enjoy this place. The two stars is mainly because they're marketed as a burger kitchen but that's not the best item there. I've had several burgers, poutines, and ice cream cones and what I would say is the food is great if you don't get a burger. Their burgers have always been far too-overlooked to the point of being tasteless and very disappointing. However, I've really enjoyed this poutines, they come at a family size so great to serve or have as a main. Their ice cream is the best priced you'll find in this area, super reasonable and best of all the waffle/sugar cones are free so you can swap you regular boring cone for one of these awesome ones! Overall I really love the idea of this place, it's more of a takeout than sit down but the people are nice abc the waiting times are reasonable. However, beware or simply ask that they don't overcook your burger as they've always been burnt for me. ."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this burger! Grabbed a classic with Swiss and nothing else. I've gotten into this habit, just the burger, maybe cheese but no other sides, no drink. Whatever, it works (for the budget too!)
Stopped by here on a Sunday lunch (actually went by Burgers Priest first but never made the church vs priest connection so, of course, they were closed). Small spot, no real room to sit but snare a stool and you're golden. The burger got me confused at first: first few bites was mostly bread and cold toppings and a touch of ground beef, but still good. But as I got through it, I realized it was just back loaded! My last 3 bites were ground beefy goodness. So good. Hear their Church St shop is licensed. Will hit that up sooner than later."}
{"text":"This one-star rating is generous. If I could replace this star with a giant, angry frowny face I would absolutely do it.

I asked for the Yelp check-in offer of a burger and beer for $9.95, and when I showed the guy at the register my phone he had no idea what it was. For all I know it's a new offer, so no big deal. He got his manager, who came out and said that the special only applies to the classic burger (which isn't indicated anywhere, but, again, that's fine). So I told the guy that all I wanted on the burger was bacon, brie, lettuce, and ketchup, and he asked which beer I wanted. They've got three beers on tap, and one of them didn't sound familiar to me (and for the life of me I can't recall what it was called right now). Sled something? Anyway, I asked what it was and he had absolutely no idea. He didn't even recognize it as a beer they sell when I called it by name - and the tap was literally at his eye level and less than a foot from his face. After I pointed right at the tap to aid in comprehension, he said they don't sell much of it, so that's why he doesn't know what it is. I could write a novel on why that's an inexcusable response in a restaurant, but I won't.

When my burger was ready, my friend who I was dining with grabbed the food and brought it to our table. My burger had everything that normally comes on a classic burger, plus bacon. I took it up to the counter and explained that it had a bunch of stuff I didn't want and was missing some stuff that I did want (and had paid extra for). The guy who originally took my order then said he wasn't sure what I wanted on the burger. What? So I reminded him of what toppings I'd requested and he took the burger back. The cook returned quickly with a burger that had only cheddar cheese and bacon on it. Still distinctly not what I ordered, but I didn't feel like arguing so I just ate it. The patty was clearly the same one that was on the previous burger, as it was cold and tasted a bit like mustard. Nothing about this burger stood out- at least, not in a good way.

Needless to say, I was extraordinarily unsatisfied and would never eat here again. And I'm sure the same goes for the other woman whose burger they messed up right after mine, but I won't even go there. And you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I have been coming to GBK for years now. I have had everything from there meat burgers to there vegan/ gluten free options. Overall I think it's not a bad place but not the best either. 

The positives:
Freshly made food.
Big menu, lots of neat options 
Great ice cream
Good burgers
Great poutine

The negatives:
Veggie burger is very bland, need oodles of sauces to add flavour
I hate the seating here! Only I ledge with stools, drives me crazy. 
They only take cash & debit.

Overall I would not make a trip to eat here, nor would I rave about the place."}
{"text":"I love GBK's house-made veggie burger - it's made with beans and quinoa among other things ... One little caveat: I'd suggest making a special request that they NOT overcook it.  Otherwise the edges usually come charred (seems they haven't yet figured out that veggie burgers cook up quite a bit quicker than their meaty counterparts)."}
{"text":"you must eat here! burger sluts welcome home!"}
{"text":"Got the 6oz premium burger $9.95, onion rings   $4.50, and a can of pop $1.50 + tax = $16.40 total

Overall it was good but wanted it to be better. The burger menu has a regular and premium burger option, so I paid the extra $2 more for the premium farm burger. I expected the premium burger to be more flavourful, and it was cooked really well done and wasn't particularly juicey.

The onion rings are massive homemade style. The batter is really thick and doughy. It would be better a littler less thick and doughy. I like this style of onion ring but these were particularly thick.

The restaurant is take out style but has a bar at the window to sit. No washroom. Can pay debit."}
{"text":"Yet another gourmet burger fast food place! I would say this place is on par/slightly better than Craft Burger or Gourmet Burger Co. and way better than Hero. I had the custom burger, which is a 6 oz. patty of really juicy, flavourful beef and really fresh toppings (although the list of free toppings is pretty basic and not as long as at Gourmet Burger Co). The GBK sauce is tasty and they have a green onion aioli that is nice too. My DC is vegetarian. They have a quinoa-based veggie burger as well as a portobello burger. She asked the staff which one he recommended and he said he actually hadn't tried either of them. I guess the staff are more into the meat ones... at least he was honest! She had the portobello burger and said it was good. 

They have a daily burger special. Today it was tomato, green onion, red onion, guacamole, and bacon. 

They are open until 11pm everyday and the guy told us that after May 2-4 weekend, they will be open until 3am on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays. I'll definitely be back to try one of their various poutines next time!"}
{"text":"First of all we need to all agree that this whole \"Gourmet Burger\" nonsense is out of control and there's nothing \"gourmet\" about a burger.  However, of all these new joints that have popped up, Great Burger is my favourite.

I just get the classic with aged Cheddar, all the toppings, untoasted bun (sometimes they char them which I don't like).

Their fries are double cooked and probably my favourite in the city.

Their onion rings are very sweet and delicious, again a favourite.

However what I end up getting most with my burger is their garden salad which is really amazing considering it's a salad from a burger joint.  I ask them to add olives which they do without question.

They also do pulled pork which, I've had better but their chicken sandwiches are really good.  Pulled pork added as a topping on the burger however... mmm!

Some warnings though:

1)  No bathroom to be found here.  They will tell you to use Starbucks two doors over.  If you ask nicely they will let you wash your hands in the kitchen sink.

2)  The fries, onion rings, salads and particularly the poutines are MASSIVE.  Most people will not be able to finish a burger and a side, so if you're going with someone, order two burgers and just share one side.  

3)  Go to the GERRARD location.  The food is better and the staff are very nice.  The GBK on Church is a joke on all levels, the two locations have nothing in common except the name."}
{"text":"Forget Gourmet Burger, if you want a real burger go to Great Burger Kitchen in Toronto East!  Their burgers are the real stuff without any weird fillers that make the meat taste rubbery.
The toppings are real, fresh vegetables and their buns are organic.  I think the burgers are a bit bready on the very outsides but once you get into the actual burger, it is very meaty!  
Their fries are great too!  It's not at all like New York fries, but more like the fresh cut potato fries that you get from the trucks - very homemade.  

The onion rings are not too battered and real onions are used, unlike many fast-food places.  My friend has also said the chicken burger is delicious.

Like many burger places, I recommend take-out to save yourself the drink cost.   The place is small and on a busy weekend, you may not be able to snatch a seat.  Although this place is close to a school,  I agree with my brother (who is a student) that it's a little out of the price-range for students. 

And speaking of students, I don't think it would hurt them to hire some older and more personable students to work there rather than the 2 teens that I saw.  I have nothing against hiring teens, I used to serve burgers as a teen at a fast-food joint myself... but it really doesn't help distinguish them from a fast-food chain.  If only they could have someone at the front that's more knowledgeable about the products and could make recommendations etc."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and not a bad experience yet.  Love the Montreal Poutine....priced well and large portions.  My favorite burger so far is the Voodoo burger...yummmm!  The only drawback to this place is that it is lacking enough seating for the business they do."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and I would say this is the best place in the East End to get poutine. The classic Montreal poutine is great with the perfect sized fries and bring your appetite or prepare to share! I had the inferno poutine the other night and it was also delicious. I have also had their burger before. I like how they have a lot of bun  options for those gluten free  or reducing carbs (lettuce bun). It was good but I definitely liked the poutine better. The staff is friendly and would love to see more seating but they have a lot of take out so it makes sense."}
{"text":"First off, I loved their comfy red leather stools and booths.

I got the classic burger with cheddar cheese, because I feel that is a good way to compare burger restaurants. I agree with some of the previous posters that the burger was a bit on the dryer/well done side compared to some of the amazing burgers I've had before. And the bun was on the bigger side. A less cooked burger, and a smaller bun, would do wonders for this place.

I'd go back because I work in the area. Not a bad burger, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go there. It was better than Big Smoke on their worst days, but not as good as Big Smoke on their best.

The best burger in Toronto for me still remains The Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"Why don't I eat burgers all the time? Coming here made me ask that question. I hadn't had a burger in forever and just never thought to get one (I never claimed to be normal). However; it was my friend's birthday and I harassed him into having lunch with me as a sneaky way of giving him a little gift. He got to choose the food and was craving burgers so we ended up here. 
He'd been out the night before so our \"lunch\" was late-around 4.30pm-and the place was deserted. This was pleasant for us really and hardly surprising considering it was only lunchtime Pacific time. There was one poor unfortunate guy serving who was stuck with serving and cooking. He was pleasant though and got going with our burgers after serving us our drinks. We both ended up with classic burgers which were delicious! The burger was just the right size for me and the bun was fresh and fluffy. There were a few different choices of burgers which I'd like to try at some stage and there is also the option to make a custom one using a variety of toppings. They have a choice of soft drinks and beer. The birthday boy was more than happy with his choice of pint!
Seating is in booths or on stools. We choose a booth and were comfy and cosy. Service was pretty friendly but not overbearing. This turned out to be a good thing when the birthday candle I stuck in my friend's birthday brownie lit the pink tissue I'd used to wrap it and we ended up with a minor fire. Our cook/server was oblivious to that little incident. Phew!
I also got away with buying a very cheap birthday lunch. Classic burgers are $5.95 each and we were both happy with our meal. I'm so glad he wasn't in the mood for steak!"}
{"text":"This place has the most horrific fries the worst i have ever had.I did some research and found there is nothing free range or locally grown in this place,people do your home work you are paying big bucks at this place for crap."}
{"text":"Wow so dissapointing, been looking forward to trying here and wow  barely any pull pork on their tasty burger (pull pork, lettuce cheese tomato) 11$ wow high way robbery... And there bbq chicken poutine,  all I have to saw is frozen chicken burgers cut up for 11$ wow 
    How do restaurants get away with crappy food high prices..."}
{"text":"Burgers and poutine? How can you not love either? GBK is locally sourced, free range and has 10+ burgers and 6 poutines you can choose from.  

Order: burger, poutine, w/drink combo ($16.52 after taxes - prices may vary)
1) Voodoo burger w/tomato salsa, spicy mayo, guacamole, balsamic onion & lettuce served on a sesame seed bun
- Decent-sized burger which has great flavour

2) Montreal Poutine w/cheese curds and gravy
- generous portion of fries/gravy
- good to share with someone if each of you ordered a burger
- was a bit disappointing because I was really excited for the poutine, perhaps I ordered the wrong poutine (pulled pork next time)! 

Overall, this was a decent experience because the cashier was friendly, environment was cozy/clean, and the burger was pretty good. I would come back again and try another burger

{"text":"The Hamburgers are cooked on a cast iron grill grate.
Need I say more.

I've been looking for a Hamburger place that cooks freshly made beef patties on a cast iron grate grill, this is your BBQ hamburger heaven.
The buns are perfect, and are grilled.
Condiments are fresh and cook in nice proportions.

Milk shakes with real fruit, and Kawartha Ice Cream.

Cost a bit to eat here, but if you want a really good meal, it's so worth it.

HIGHLY, HIGHLY, recommended, for that BBQ burger and real milkshake, doesn't get any better than this...

EDIT: OHH and the Poutines they have are super fresh, and the fries and gravy are to die for.
Super big basket of poutine... :)"}
{"text":"i hafta to disagree with most of the reviewers.  after trying most gourmet burger places in the city, this is my favourite.

i've tried gbk a few times, and the flavour and texture on the classic burger are perfectly balanced.  i'd pick a gbk burger over the bymark burger any day.  a little expensive, but you do get a lot."}
{"text":"Update again May 21: it was good again today.  The fries were excellent, the service was good and my burger was just slightly pink and juice.  This is what I want.  back to 4 stars.  Hope it stays this good.

To summarize my update in one word: inconsistent.

The first time I went here it really was 5 stars.  The second and third times it was a 3 star experience (or maybe 2 for the price :/)

2nd time summary: the fries were great but I ordered the smaller burger and it was overcooked.  Epic disappointment because the best thing about my first visit was that the burger juiced all over everything.  I sort of gave them a buy on that visit because it is harder to cook smaller burgers and maintain their juiciness and everything else was right.

3rd time summary: Fries were WAAAY overcooked and borderline stale tasting (which is weird because I pretty much watched him take them out of the fryer).  Fry fail.  But!  I had reverted to the big burger so I was going to let the fries slide.  Unfortunately... my burger was also over done and was kinda of bland/meh.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  

There is a consistency problem here.  Or maybe there isn't and my first opening-day visit was the anomaly (I hope not).  But... I'm going to let them get this sorted a bit more before I go back again.  I'm not as excited about this as I was when it opened.

Note to everyone about ordering:
Tell them you want a custom burger, and then tell them your toppings.  You don't have to do the process-of-elimination ordering that they try to force you into and everyone else here has had problems with. I have never gotten the wrong toppings by telling them 'custom burger, with....'"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The burgers are great, my favourite being the river dale. The poutine is absolutely amazing. I don't live in the area but I frequently make the trip a few times a month the food."}
{"text":"Not so great burger kitchen....

The first time I had a burger from this place, it was euphoric. The meat was so fresh and juicy and the burger tasted exactly like what you would want a burger to taste like. 

Unfortunately when I ordered a burger on April 23 (@ 3:14pm through uber) what I received was a far cry from above. 

The meat was so overcooked the entire patty was black; not 'char grilled' just burnt. The meat inside was hard like saw dust that had been mixed with glue. It was so bitter from the amount of char coating the outside of the burger it was inedible. See uploaded photos. 

The bun was squished and mushy. The whole burger just kind of collaspe around the pucks they were trying to pass off as patties.

I hope this was a one off thing and I just got really unlucky. I would never wish the burger I had on even my worst of enemies."}
{"text":"I just Loved the food at this place. I came with a group of friends and everyone was so happy with their meals. My classic burger was perfect."}
{"text":"I can't post a picture of my burger because I was too obsessed eating it to put it down. Grilled bun, simply seasoned, flavorful meat, perfect toppings. Fries are good too, though I do find the poutine  portions to be big, but that is a high class problem.

I have also had the onion rings. They are good scorching hot with ketchup or malt vinegar to cut the grease. But not enough onion to batter, for me... I happen to prefer 70% onion to 30% batter. 


And still I adore the burger."}
{"text":"I like it.  It's a cozy place with a very good burger and good poutine at good prices.  They also have a small selection of beer on tap which is a plus.  I really enjoyed the burger here.  I think it was one of the best burgers I have had in the city.  I wouldn't call it a great burger though, just damn good.  I guess Good Burger Kitchen doesn't have the same ring to it.  The different styles of poutine are also very good.  I tried 3 different kinds and all were very tasty and unique in flavour.  I would definitely come back here again to try the different selection of burgers."}
{"text":"I'll make a long story short and say that GBK is currently my favourite place to get a burger in Toronto, and has been for a long time now.

They have a burger du jour all week long as well as a poutine of the day. If that doesn't tickle your fancy you can always choose from the many menu options.

There are many burger and poutine combinations. I make my way here often to satisfy my craving for a good meat patty cooked the way I like it.

Must-try items:
Voodoo Burger 
Montreal Poutine
Feta, Cheddar & Swiss Poutine

Most of the time I dine in but they also do takeout very well. They also deliver in the Leslieville area, which is a great excuse to move into this neighbourhood, not that you needed one. Seriously, try these burgers. They're awesome."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since day one. Food is good and the service is usually good also except as of late. The lady at the counter will take my order and I usually order a burger with fries and gravy. I clearly ask for the gravy on the fries because if you don't the gravy will come in this little container that is not nearly enough for the amount of fries you get. Surprise my fries will come with the gravy in this tiny container after my request being as clear as day. NOT to this lady, so congrats on losing a loyal customer after giving you 3 strikes. GBK enjoy the 25 cents you've saved on my gravy order, but the gravy train stops here.
I even know the owners sorry Ted..."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is a quinoa and bean-based patty that is incredibly dry and crumbles apart as soon as you bite into the burger. I ended up with basically a sandwich filled with lettuce, tomatoes and peppers and huge chunks of burger patty around me. At $5.95, it's quite fairly priced, but doesn't deliver much of an impact in terms of flavour. The bun is a large, soft sesame bun that is a little bit overwhelming. 
 If you're looking for a vegetarian option, I would go for the Portobello burger instead -- unless you have a strong aversion to portobello mushrooms...then just go somewhere else. Fries were okay while they were hot, but strangely lost all of their appeal once they started to cool down. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger spot for the groupon deals I purchased.  Otherwise I doubt i would stop here on a regular day and pay for a meal.  Its a tad expensive and the burgers vary.  One time it was cooked to perfection and the next time it was dry and overcooked. Another time the fries were super greasy and overly salty, next time they tasted fantastic! Same with the onion rings.  This place needs to be more consistent !"}
{"text":"Ummmmm #lickinglips. Now that's a #burger!!!!

Love love love GBK! Great poutines, even greater burgers, a definite Leslieville staple.

My AB-SOLUTE AB-BUSTING fave is the Voodoo burger. I mean, need I say more? I do? Ok fine: tomato salsa, spicy  mayo, guacamole, balsamic onions, sandwiched between a bed of lettuce, a fresh bun, and local free range beef. Gimme!!!

The Greek burger is a close second, or the Danforth if you want chicken. But don't take my word for it- stop by or follow them on twitter to see what the Burger and Poutine of the day is. I intend to go down the list when I'm ready to go back to elastic pants again.  Till then, let me know how they treat you. 

I RECOMMEND- you call in your order. These burgers take a while but are worth the wait."}
{"text":"What to do on a Sunday night?  We've been spendthrift conscious all week and have prepared meals at home.  Sunday night seemed like a good idea to eat out.

I was initially excited over trying the Great Burger Kitchen after driving by it numerous times and finally getting a menu in the mail.  

Burgers were ok.  I immediately thought of Mr. Greenjeans, etc.  However wasn't a fan of the fries.  My husband ordered poutine, and threw it out.  :( I had just an order of fries.

$28 for 2 people, IMO is way too pricey.  Probably will not go back.  It's a shame because the ideology is great but GBK needs to step it up!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a lamb burger I ordered? It was very good but the two things that kill another star are my belief that it was a little dry and definitely a bit overwhelmed with goat cheese.

It is nice to see hand cut fries but these do not come close to those of Five Guys or other speciality fry places. Overall I would say it was a good experience. If you are in the burger mood do give it a try. Everything is made to order right in front of you."}
{"text":"i always tell myself im gonna try their burger on my next visit but  i always fall for their poutine!!! nice thick cut fries and crispy too!

i smother my mushroom swiss poutine w.extra gravy too! The portion is massive so i always split it with someone or take it home for a second meal.

 my friends who have had their burgers all rave about how juicy and flavorful it is! cant go wrong by adding cheese and bacon on it!"}
{"text":"YES. After two months of waiting, the veggie burger here has finally been perfected and is ready for steady consumption. Unlike some burger joints (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/craft-burger-toronto & http://www.yelp.ca/biz/craft-burger-toronto-2) it's made in-house from scratch instead of being plucked out of a Costco pack and reheated on the grill.

You can see real quinoa, black beans and peppers throughout, and it's a little crumbly but in a way that makes you appreciate its freshness. Pair it with guac, goat cheese and tomatoes for a killer combo. A basket of fries can be shared amongst two or more people so don't bother ordering your own - save your appetite for the burger!"}
{"text":"This GBK location is right by my old high school and one of the best poutineries I've tried. I am obsessed with the mushroom swiss poutine, $6.95 + tax for a massive portion I always have to end up sharing with one other person. The fries on the poutine just seems a little overcooked during most times but the rest of the ingredients make up for it and the best part is that everything is locally sourced! Great concept & amazing food!"}
{"text":"My quest for the best burger in Toronto stopped by the Great Burger Kitchen recently. 

I ordered a classic burger with a side of onion rings. The burger was flavorful, but very messy! The onion rings were absolutely amazing - super crispy and oh-so tasty!

My husband ordered the lamb burger. It was just alright  and over done.

I would classify GBC more in the gourmet category of burgers because you can get so much more then a classic burger. I will definitely give this place another shot!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bf when we were craving burgers one day as we were in the area. 

We each got a burger and split a poutine. Everything was absolutely delicious! Staff were friendly. Not much else to say.

Would return but I'm never really in the area!"}
