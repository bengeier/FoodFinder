{"text":"Since the unfortunate fire at Ni Ji Sushi, my hubby knew I had to have my regular sushi fix and had discovered Sagano, which was located only a stone's throw away (at the Delta Hotel) from our residence. Our window seat was wonderful and offered a great view, the wait staff were friendly and incredibly professional, and the food was both beautifully presented as well as delicious. I had the 5 course meal (Tenryu) with miso soup to start, followed by an avocado and shrimp salad, then a lobster tail soaked in a creamy sauce, steak (medium rare) with vegetables, and to top it all off; black sesame ice cream served in a wafer cup with a cherry. Oh and let us not forget the sake! :-) My hubby had an assortment of maki rolls, a tempura appetizer and Sapporo beer with ginger ice cream to finish. The decor is a bit dated, but the noise level was perfect (quiet), the food was excellent and the service was wonderful. It is pricy, but I will pay for good food any time."}
{"text":"4 of us (2 couples), went to Sagano on Saturday night for dinner. Parking was a disaster, and we ended up in the back parking lot, and had difficulty finding our way to the main lobby. The elevators to the 14th floor were a bit smelly, could have been from the chlorine in the indoor pool. once we reached the 14th floor, we had to climb about 10 stairs to get to the restaurant. There is no handicap access that we could see, so it was a bit difficult for some of us. Once there, we were greeted by a lady in a kimono. My wife and I had lived in Japan for 18 months, so we were familiar with their customs, and felt that the way they greeted us, was close to original greetings. We were shown to our table by the window, and had a good view of the city skyline. our reservation was at 8:00PM and there were only about 10 other people there. No sooner had we sat down, when they brought fluffy warm damp towels to us. Much different from the wet ones you normally get at other \"Japanese\" restaurants. I tried out my limited Japanese on the lady in the kimono, and she understood me, so I knew we were in an authentic Japanese spot. It was a set menu, with 4 different mains to choose from. We each ordered a different bento box. Chicken, salmon, tempura and beef. The miso soup was the best I have tasted outside of Japan. the mandarin salad was OK, but the sashimi appetizers (salmon and tuna), melted in our mouths. We also had 2 containers of sake, which were good, but could have been a bit warmer. My friend and I had some draft Sapporo beer, which was very good. We each shared a taste of each others' bentos, and all 4 were excellent. the green tea/ginger ice cream was served in a small pastry shell. It was a very nice presentation, as was all the courses. The service was friendly and efficient, and we all had lots to eat. A bit expensive, but worth it, for a special occasion. It it wasn't for the parking problems and the lack of handicap facilities, I would have rated it with 5 stars. We were the last to leave around 10:00PM, and did manage to get a great view of the sunset over Toronto"}
{"text":"Great service and fun to be at rooftop level.  The food was decent but not spectacular.  We went here as a birthday treat for the novelty of being at the top floor with view. Also, wanted to try dishes that were seared table side (as recommended by other yelpers).  Latter was unique but dish was extremely sweet with sauce on top!  Was hoping for a simple seasoned dish.    We got a groupon for 2 people - 5 course meal each with sake/green tea 1-Miso soup (had lots of sliced shiitake mushrooms in it) 2-Manadarin/almond slivers salad  3-Assorted Sashimi/sushi  (average) 4-choice of entree beef striploin, teriyaki salmon, shrimp/veggie tempura, or chicken yakitori 5-green tea or ginger ice cream 6-sake / green tea  Judging by the pictures posted by other yelpers, our groupon meal seemed to be of smaller portions..regardless, we were quite full.  It's fun to come here for the view, good service, quietness, and table side searing....the food is so so."}
{"text":"Knockoff japanese food made lovingly by the Indian staff for too much money. I usually have fantastic experiences with groupons but this was not one of them. Each table around me was using a coupon of some sort and expected service and quality that was unfortunately lacking. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Very fresh sashimi and sushi. Excellent view from the rooftop of the hotel. However, we did not get a table by the window even though we mentioned about that was a special occasion for us with our baby.  Here is my rating for the restaurant: Noise level: Very quiet (2) Food: Excellent (5) Service: Good (3.5) View: Very nice (4)"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for an intimate small party.  Food isn't great.  There are some all you can eat japanese buffets that tastes better.  And the prices aren't cheap either.  For example,  miso soup, cod, sashimi and ice cream is $55.    If you have coupons you must print them. Also, try to check Trip Advisor and Groupon, they have discounts for this place.  Overall, pricey for mediocre food but good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent and fresh.  Service is very slow.  Travelzoo voucher users are not treated the same as regular walk-in.  For example, Sunday family specials are not available.  Even with the vouchers, this place is overpriced.  Without the vouchers, this place is outrageously overpriced.  Skip this place and go to Aoyama (when I don't go) or Cafe Michi or Zen which are close by and much, much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I definitely recommend for a night out or a dinner date. Great atmosphere and 100% the freshest seafood."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. & hella expensive at that.  The only thing that I did enjoy was the fresh sashimi. Other than that, the food  was sub-par. Quite disappointing, especially because of its supposed reputation and \"view\" from the restaurant. The view of which overlooks the highway and an AMC 30 across the street.  The rice in the sushi rolls was so hard and unflavourful and the steak teriyaki was pedestrian- even Teriyaki Experience in the food court creates a more appealing meal. The lobster salad sounded awesome, but was overcooked and deconstructed. Such a shame too, because the dressing was actually very flavourful, but hard to get a composed bite out of all the separate pieces. We tried a lot of the dishes. We didn't enjoy any of them.    Thank God, my friend had membership, and so we got our entire meal half-price. That being said, we were still disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here with the prix fixe dinner for 2 Groupon and were pretty pleased with what we got.  The view is nice as is the ambiance, although there was a large dinner meeting going on (group of about 20 business men at one long table) which got a bit loud at times.  The Groupon gave us a 5 course dinner with sake.  The carafe of sake was served warm and really quite tasty.  We started with miso soup which was one of the better miso soups I have had at a restaurant.  Next was the mandarin and almond ginger salad which was the usual iceberg lettuce salad and ginger dressing elevated a bit with the mandarin slices and some toasted almonds.  The sushi course was 4 California rolls and 6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, salmon, and some white fish), so  decent size.  The California rolls were pretty good and the sashimi was nice size pieces and cut pretty thick, not the usual small thin pieces you would expect.  For the entre course, I had the beef which was 2 skewers which were good quality meat and not over cooked and with a tasty sauce.  This was accompanied with seasonal veggies and rice.  Dessert was a scoop of either green tea or ginger ice cream.  This was the usual small scoop you expect topped with a strawberry.  Overall, I would say the food was good and the value was pretty good with the Groupon.  Their regular menu is pretty overpriced but you are paying more for location and view than food."}
{"text":"I have been to Sagano a few times across the years. My first few visits around 2004-2008 had been splendid. The food was nicely served and the portions were of the right size.  I went back for the winterlicious 2012 and I was deeply disappointed. There was nothing particularly attractive with the food and was not worth the price anymore. In the past, they would have decorated the ice cream with a waffle bowl and a beautiful drizzled image on the side. Now they simply serve the ice cream in a regular bowl.   The scenery is beautiful though, I must compliment on that."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for many, many years and used to be one of the better Japanese restaurants around. However,  I recently dined here and the food was pretty much awful, and way overpriced for what it was.   Main problem: They changed their menu. They only have a few types of sushi and sashimi to order, and these are the usual standard types, eg, salmon, tuna and whitefish, which you can get at a food court.  No sushi boats. Their maki rolls were large, flat and fell apart when picked up with chopsticks. The karage was basically deep fried chicken wings. The pork tonkatsu came with a ketchupy dipping sauce. The tossed salad was ok, but the miso chowder was horrible (watery). Wine choices were very limited.  My biggest issue: An order of skewers consists of 3 of them. We had 7 in our party, so we had 2 orders of each type of skewer (so 6 each order), but I asked if we could add 1 more skewer and we would pay the difference. Each order was $12 for 3 skewers, so I assumed they would add 1 skewer for $4 more to make it $16 which is what almost every restaurant I would go to for tapas would suggest if we had an odd sized party. However, they said no. Sagano does not do that.   I will not return."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night while staying at a Delta hotel east of downtown, a change from my norm in Toronto. I opted for one of the five course meals which was about 55 CAD. It was a great deal!  The miso soup was tasty with fresh mushrooms floating on top. The avocado shrimp salad was refreshing but the sesame dressing was my favorite. The lobster and steak were cooked perfectly and was a solid good dish. The waitress recommended I try two of the ice creams and I opted for black sesame and mango. I wish I had a double serving of the black sesame."}
{"text":"Do not be tricked by the traditional interior and decorations and waitresses in yukatas.   The food was NOT even authentic Japanese cuisine. Overpriced. The only good value was the appetizers but only because the quantity over quality scale. My boyfriend even mentioned that the sake tasted funny.   I was totally upset on how poor the garnishing was too for every dish.   The only thing I was impressed with was the hot towel that they provide for you in the beginning for you to wash your hands with.   There are better quality Japanese cuisine that's cheaper and has more value.   Very disappointed and won't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have been going there for almost 12 yrs now. I have never had a bad experience with the food. Only service 1-2 times that i've been there. The hostess/manager is so nice & very warm to customers. The food, is delicious, i can't choose a fav because everything tastes so good & fresh. Not many Japanese restaurants have good terriyaki & sushi, but Sagano certainly does. The view is spectacular, never mind that it's Scarborough & not the Toronto skyline, it is beautiful!!"}
{"text":"Came here for new years eve and they had a special fixed menu. I believe it was $44 for the 3 course meal. Started off with miso soup, salad and sushi. Their sushi was pretty average. For my mail meal I got the salmon teriyaki with rice and tempura asparagus. I enjoyed it, but again, it was pretty average. For dessert I got their green-tea cheesecake which I actually really enjoyed. I liked the place itself, it was smaller than I expected but you had a nice view of buildings and the street I guess. Overall, I thought it was too pricey for average tasting food"}
{"text":"For my experience, it's actually closer to 3 stars because of the hour long drive here, but otherwise, it's a really nice place.   Got a teambuy as well for this restaurant for a 5 course prix-fixe menu. Start soup + salad, sushi and sashimi appetizer, choice of main, sake for 2 and ice cream for dessert.   The sashimi appetizer is a lot more than we thought; it came in a bento box along with a salmon roll. It was actually pretty good (not the sake talking), however I felt that I could of gotten the same quality at almost any sushi restaurant much closer downtown.   The main: Filet of beef teriyaki. It was also really good, cooked a little bit raw, which is just the way I like it.   Me and my boyfriend were actually quite full from everything so definitely satisfied. If you're going on a date, make sure to get a window seat! The sunset is quite beautiful (although over buildings and highways) and sake always helps.   Taking a look at the regular menu, it was a bit more pricey than what I would expect for the quality of the food + the restaurant inside the hotel is inconvenience for me coming from downtown Toronto. But to anyone who's staying at the Delta Toronto East and looking for a great date night, this would be a viable option."}
{"text":"This place is located on the top of the Delta Hotel, it is on the 15th floor (the elevator takes you to the 14th, you'll need to walk up 2 flights of stairs to get to it).  It is on top of the presidential suite and has the best view of the hotel.  Eating here gives you free parking at the hotel (yes parking costs money), and a very nice greeting from the welcomer/seater.  Since this place is expensive and not cheap, it is only 1/4 full.  I came here for an early birthday dinner on the weekend for my wife and through a suggestion of a coworker.  I have been to fair share of sushi restaurants (even ones right on Hollywood Boulevard) so I've tried the very cheap and the very expensive of sushi restaurants.  I would give the sushi of this restaurant above average to good.  Sashimi is good but I've tasted better (really depends on the supplier anyway).  The sushi was well made but not spectacular.  There are many common sushi here and not a specialized sushi restaurant.  The View is what you are paying your money for.  Like some other reviewers wrote down, it is a great place for a romantic date, meeting, or a cup of coffee.  I don't recall any restaurants that was that close to the Highway 401 and that high up.  The decor is excellent.  If you want to come here to just try the place out but not want to break the wallet then I suggest you go for their Bento combos or course meals.  Do not order items seperate considering the salad and ice cream alone is $7 each (I told my wife to order without looking at the price, my bad).  I recommend those that would want a cup of tea or to just wow a girlfriend within Scarborough area to come here, the view is pretty amazing compare to anything nearby.  Friendly Staff as Well!"}
{"text":"Came here coz of Groupon deal; it's a five-course dinner with sake.  We were greeted right away and seated by the window with a nice view.  Our server bought us hot tea and warm towels for wiping our hands.  The service was excellent.  First came the miso soup which had no miso taste.  The salad came next; it was fresh tho.  The California roll and sashimi were the worst.  Tuna and salmon sashimi weren't fresh at all; they were bland and they were warm!! For entree, we had shrimp tempura and tenderloin beef strips.  The shrimps  were fresh and the beef was tender.  Even though their hot food are good, the service is great and the view is nice, I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"We visited using a Teambuy coupon.  We received a prix fixe menu that consisted of starter soup and salad, sushi and sashimi appetizer, choice of main protein entree, ice cream dessert, tea and sake.  The food was nicely prepared and delicious.  The sashimi was amazing.  I highly recommend it.  The sake stood out as it was deliciously strong.  The portion of the overall meal was adequate.  In all, the prix fixe meal, while nothing unique, did not disappointed.  On the other hand, I took a look at the regular menu and saw some interesting items.  The services was polite and sufficient.  The venue looks dated, but people would enjoy the night view (there isn't much of a day view).  If possible, it will be a good idea to get a table along the window.  I wouldn't call Sagano's pricing approachable for the general public.  I don't think the pricing is too high for the calibre of this restaurant, but it is beyond my normal budget.  Therefore, I highly recommend trying Sagano out if you can find a group buy deal.  You can visit again for special occasions and order many of the interesting items on the regular menu."}
{"text":"This is an ideal place to to take family or friends for a special occasion. I went with my parents for dinner on a Saturday night during Summerlicious 2012. The restaurant was not busy possibly because it was a bit pricey.    The regular menu was more appealing than the Summerliciious menu so my parents ordered from the regular Tenryu 5 part combination and I had the Shokado bento box.   The portions were very generous though. My father enjoyed the avocado salad  and beef teriyaki. The bento box was more than sufficient for one but could feed a second person if need be. The atmosphere was quiet pleasant and you can have a conversation with those around you. The staff were very friendly as well.   I would recommend Sagano for those looking for nice place to dine in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 20+ years. Even though this restaurant is in Scarborough, it is lose enough to North York. A very quiet getaway.. The view is intriguing."}
{"text":"We visited due to a groupon offer. Came here expecting good food and great service. Only received mediocre service and food.  The enteee was tasteless so it was dipped in excessive teriyaki sauce. We tried the beef and the salmon. Tempura is not an entree but a side in japanese cuisine, yet it was listed as an entree. The service was mediocre when we asked if there was wifi, and the reply we received was that \"we want our customers to enjoy the food\", yet with their incredibly slow service, it was impossible not to fiddle with our smart phones.  I believe this place is worth a try if you get a great deal with groupon or other alternatives. Otherwise I recommend another place for japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I've been Sagano twice.  First visit is alot better than the second one.  First time is during weekend and second during weekday.  First time is served by a Japanese lady, although the service is not super good, but still nice.  Second probably is a chinese lady, just so so service. We had Osaka & Kyoto Course for both visit.  Beef for the first visit is really good, but not for the second.  I love the Stuffed Shitake Mushroom, taste really crispy but not oily.  Salad is just so so, very common.  Sashimi is fresh.  The best part of the meal is the dessert, must try!  It's a art work!  If u look at my pics u will understand the reason.  The japanese lady really did a great job on this.  I think black sesame ice cream is far better than green tea ice cream, so pls bear in mind when u order."}
{"text":"What I really like about this restaurant is the quietness and the ambiance; the food is just okay. Do not expect it to be super 'authentic' as it is a restaurant within a hotel chain. Price of course will be on the higher end too, so if you're looking for an authentic Japanese dining experience, there are actually many others outside of a hotel.   One of the cute things they do is the dessert, which is essentially a scoop of ice cream in a waffle cup kind of thing, but the plate is decorated with mango sauce and whatnot, and pictures are drawn (ig moment there).  The sushis are not the best, and appears have gone down in quality over the years (Sagano has been around for a while), but their sashimi is still okay, and service is still excellent. This restaurant is probably better for a quiet meet up/drink nowadays.  The food is okay, but the capturing point might be the ambiance, view, service, and the roof-top (indoor) dining experience."}
