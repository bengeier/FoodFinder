{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants. Delicious food and salsa as well as great prices for large portions. The owner is usually the one that takes my order and he's always friendly and makes sure I'm happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Formerly Soco's Mexican Restaurant. Still excellent service and food (same recipes). The new owner is friendly and welcomes input. Some changes will be coming and they are now open on Saturdays  (which is when my wife always suggests we go)."}
{"text":"I have eaten take out about 12 times since I found them. I really enjoy everything I order. Its pretty close to authentic mexican  food. Great frijoles, guacamole,chips,meats,and rich salsas.I love spice and with there tomato or verdi spicy salsa you can make the food pop.I will say the rice is pretty bland but that wont stop me from eating there. Staff is always  very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very friendly and welcoming. Helpful when trying to decide what to order. The tortillas are in house made fresh every day. They are delicious . The chips are great with a sauce bar (very hot be careful!) the sauces are great.  Ceviche is amazing! Very fresh and full of shrimp. I also love the shredded chicken and did I mention the tacos are 1.25?! Great place. Yeah tapatio is across the street but I go to Gino's!"}
{"text":"Best damn Mexican around. The same but way better than socos, better than la burrita. So affordable. Salsa is godly. 10000000 stars!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here since the reopening, I seriously suggest you do!  Lots of the same food, I think mostly the same staff.....but something is different.....and undeniably BETTER!  (And it's not just the salsa!)  The Tortas are solid, street tacos delectable, but my fav is still the Carne Asada.  Best part: it's fully kid approved.....and I have some pretty picky ones!"}
{"text":"This place changed owners and the name but not much else! I have always found their prices slightly high for a no table service restaurant but the food is consistent and good. I am only giving 4 starts because I have had lots of good food here but my favorite mexican dish is chile rellano and theirs falls short.    That said the new owner is super duper nice and helpful and you can tell really cares about you enjoying your meal.  The casual environment is great if you have kids with you.   The service here used to be dreadfully slow but I have noticed a big change in this when the new owner took over.  I haven't had to wait 20 minutes for a burrito to go since!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty good and is the third best spot for tacos, IMO, after garcias tacos and Ordaz's in Medford.   I ordered the carne asada, pollo asada, adobada and al pastor tacos. The tacos were on a two perfectly handmade tortillas.  They were topped with cabbage and white onion.   My favorite from the four in order were adobada, pollo asado, al pastor and carne asada. They were all tender and flavorful except for the asada that could of used more marinating or seasoning. Their meat portions were good on that  tacos and the super burritos are huge too.   The service was good and they even have mexican paletas for those want desert.   Overall this is a good spot and would go to again."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times under the Soco's name. Food is decent though if you order a burrito, that's all you get. No beans and rice. Hopefully the new owner changes this. I mean, no beans and Rice? Come on, the cheapest side dishes on the planet are a necessity to good Mexican cuisine."}
