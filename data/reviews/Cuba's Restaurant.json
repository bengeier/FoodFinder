{"text":"absolutely delicious cuisine. The real taste of cuba is in every dish with imported spices from cuba and my favorite dishes Ropa Vieja. delish. Tamales are filled with roast pork. I had a mojito which was really refreshing. Danced friday night till my feet were sore. Live music and salsa lessons every friday and saturday. Great place to be at if you like the cuban culture. i will definately return."}
{"text":"The food was awesome I will definitely return!!! Only negative was no flan!!! The staff was so friendly. The food tasted like it was made with passion!!!"}
{"text":"Trully amazing food. Everything tastes like your Cuban grandma just made you food. Amazing!!! And great entertainment!"}
{"text":"My Dad and I came to Cubas after seeing the great reviews online. Let me tell you that this restaurant does NOT come anywhere close to the 5 stars it has. First off, the service was incredibly slow, especially since there was only one other party there. I don't remember the names but i ordered a sandwich and chips. My Dad got a salad with chicken. The sandwich was ok but the chips were almost black because of the old oil they were cooked in. My Dads salad was nothing special. The chicken was VERY undercooked and tasted like rubber.   We didn't finish our food and asked for the bill. Cuba's charged us almost $50 for a sandwich+ fries, a chicken salad and two waters. To top things off, their debit machine (which is a cracked phone) didn't work and we had to pay cash. Normally I don't like to give bad reviews but I just want to warn anyone who thinks this is a five star restaurant  I had to apologize to my dad several times for bringing him here. I dont think he forgives me. Thanks Cubas"}
{"text":"Loved this experience - loved the service, the authentic dishes, the flavour and spices yummmm! A little gem this is! We started off with chicharron ( homemade pork rinds) which were delicious and hard to share. Following house made salad with a healthy amount of garlic (liked that)  were three dishes - Ropsa Vieja a beef wine and spice mix with a generous bean and rice serving and yuca, (which was served with all three dishes) bass fillet saut√©ed in white garlic sauce and a pork chop dish. The beef and fish dishes won us over. The house made hot sauce was divine and gave already wonderfully spiced dishes extra punch. Home made churros to dip in a delectable chocolate sauce and a cake called Tres Leche were both to die for... Our table made up of generally kind sharing people turned greedy and slightly barbaric over the app and the deserts- battling to increase shares :-) each person for them self! Two thumbs up for a wonderful find! Would highly recommend this authentic experience to anyone with an interest in venturing away from mainstream cuisine."}
{"text":"Cuba's is a great place to eat delicious, authentic Cuban food.  The chef Dunir and his wife are extremely friendly and provide great service.  This restaurant is a welcome addition in Oakville.    My personal favorites from the menu are the Masas de Cerdo (chunks of fried pork) and the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in a tomato based sauce).  Don't forget the rice, beans, and fried plantains to accompany them. The Ajiaco soup is amazing as well.   This is a great place to bring a date, or the whole family. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delcicious. Being from puerto rico i can be very picky when it comes to latin food. The host Connie was super friendly, warm and welcoming. The cooks Dunier and Yusneil were absolutely awesome. Dunier actually came out and checked in on how everything was. The place is very cozy and has that \"homie\" feeling which i always loom forward to when trying to get a good meal. If your looking for a latin, delicious, home style cooked food. This is where you want to come to. We ordered a Cuban Sandwich, Tostones Rellenos con pollo (Plantains (cup styled) with chicken and a pork sandwich). We are here on business but are in town frequently so definitely will return."}
{"text":"So so good. Try everything you can ! Leftovers are always good.  The chef was at my table several times to get my feedback. Felt the Cuban experience, music, food & people.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Friendly atmosphere and staff! Delicious and authentic Cuban food!"}
{"text":"Such a refreshing change from the usual fare in Oakville. Cuban food is hard to come by outside of downtown Toronto, but the tastes, the flavors, the choices, and the freshness comes out here. The restaurant is new and they're finding their feet still with some of the nuances of restaurant service, but the food is honestly worth the wait. Delicious. We had the shrimp paella -- consistency like nothing I've ever had before, almost creamy in its texture with the grains of rice melting into the chunks of seafood and sausage.  Pork steak -- a little tough but tasty, with what tasted like asofanada seasoning. And for appys we had these croquettes of bread that were lightly fried and topped with an onion and tomato seasoning?  Can't remember the name but just so satisfying -- warm, bready, savory... Mmm. I could pop a few more of those in my mouth right now.  Finally for dessert we got complimentary rice pudding which was like cinnamon in your mouth. So tasty.   Just loved the atmosphere and authenticity of this place. They're new, they're not well-heeled and refined in their presentation yet, but they have a great restaurant and the food is home made, fresh, and so, so good.   A hidden gem in Oakville. Finally brings some cultural flavors to this town."}
{"text":"Went here after they moved back to Oakville, good move.  They also started making Cubans Sandwiches now, for lunch.  I love, love this place. Has to be one of the most under rated places in this area. True Cuban food, with an atmosphere and a friendly bunch of people. We've tried many dishes at this place. Love coming here, again and again. My favourites are the Maduros, Masa De Cerdo  Cuban Paella,  Basa and the Churros. Friday nights, they have great entertainment. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service was excellent. When I mentioned I was Vegetarian to the waitress, she immediately went to ask the chef if there were any other options for me apart from what was on the menu. The chef himself came to our table to inquire about what I would like made or I can choose from the menu. I ended picking the Veggie Paella off the menu and it was very delicious! Since we had lunch on New Year's eve they mentioned we could join their little party they were throwing at the restaurant if we had no plans.  Such friendly peeps!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed with the food here. The pork ( a Cuban staple) tasted like it was from the previous day. Also gets my vote for the worst mojito I have ever drank. How can a Cuban restaurant not make a good mojito and have the stones to charge premium prices. Then the owner wants to take your picture and have you sign the interior wall. Don't get me wrong - I love home cooked food like abuelita used to make but I think the quality of food and authentic recipes have been trumped by the proprietor's dream of being a restaurateur. Could do better if they had a properly trained chef from Cuba. PS - the tostones were not fresh either"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife and we will be back for lunches and dinners in the future. While eating awesome sandwiches and plantain fries some conversation started with the owners, what sweet and genuine people they are, their daughter  sung and danced for us and I felt like I was at a friend's house. They told us of the live music they have and I can see we will be frequenting on  Fri. or Sat. As we could walk, munch out on fabulous food and drink, have some music and a nice waterfront walk home."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place and were not disappointed . Food was very good and reasonably priced. We started with the tostones rellenos which were fried plantain cups stuffed with a tomato sauce beef. I had the seafood salad and my husband and son shared the seafood paella. We thoroughly enjoyed our food and ate it all! The owners were very friendly and their daughter adorable. We would go back again and try some other dishes."}
