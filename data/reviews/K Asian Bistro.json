{"text":"I NEVER thought that I would try sushi but after several trips with a real sushi fan friend, I am sold. I am not really too adventurous but the tuna/avocado and salmon are very good. The hot tea is so satisfying and the servers are all very nice. It's a great place to meet friends for lunch because there are other options if they are not interested in trying sushi."}
{"text":"Whenever I've driven along Route 8, fine sushi has not generally sprung to mind.  In between Eat n Park, and the myriad fast food restaurants, though, is nestled an unassuming door-front in a strip mall which delivers the most surprising culinary experience.

This restaurant - which seems never to be particularly busy - looks much like any other strip mall restaurant.  The room is functional, not opulent or stylish.  The lighting and music choices are not what you'd expect in one of the more high-end downtown restaurants.  But then the food arrives, and everything changes.

We have been there many times now (our young kids love it as well as the grown-ups).  Every time the service is friendly and efficient.  And the sushi is quite spectacular.  We moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco and this food would not be out of place there.  The fish is of a high quality, it's well-prepared and cut and always served at the right temperature.

We look forward to going there, the food and experience are consistently great, and the prices are reasonable.  I almost don't want to post a review, in case the place starts getting too busy!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi! We had a sushi and sashimi combo for two and all of the fish was great. We talked to the staff and the chef seems to put in a great effort in getting best local fish.  We'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"What a great little place! The other reviewers are right when they say, what a nice surprise and it's about time! This community is starving for nice places to have a quality meal. 

Well this is that place! Everything we had was so good and prepared wonderfully. I highly recommend the pineapple fried rice. I have had this dish in other restaurants but this one was superior, it had a little spice in there that gave it a little kick, and it really made it stand out.

Also any thing from the sushi bar, I had the house special roll which was amazing. Also we sat close to the sushi bar and everything they prepared while we were there was looked beautiful.

Amazing service, really well decorated. Go there and try it. This is the kind of place you try and then really want to last!"}
{"text":"Ive been driving through in Gibsonia for 3 years and have never seen this place before. I decided to stop here for dinner even though sushi doesn't have many options when your vegetarian; what a great surprise!. The restaurant is small but nicely decorated. I had the spicy mango salad, tempura asparagus sushi and peanut/avacado sushi. Everything was amazingly delicious. The salad didn't skimp on mango and wasn't too spicy, but with a nice kick. The veggie sushi had really nice textures and mix of flavors. Would def recommend it and will def be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, wonderful service. Extremely reasonable lunch prices. The owner always says hello to us by name and is always very kind and gracious. Best crab rangoons on the planet, try the k special duck roll - you won't be disappointed. It's BYOB and there is a liquor stores a few doors away."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi in Pittsburgh? Yes. Great prices, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food, the prices are great, and their range of food is just amazing"}
{"text":"The cafeteria was closed at work for the holidays and I had forgotten to pack a lunch.  Luckily K Asian Bistro was there to save the day.  I went for lunch with some coworkers and we had a great time.  Prompt service, the lunch Bento Boxes are a great value and tasted very good.  I'm docking one star for the atmosphere.  The neon lights and smooth jazz was pretty bad.  

Despite the d√©cor I will definitely be back and come hungry."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi are amazing. The rolls are clever and delicious.  The soups... impressive.  We haven't had a favorite Japanese restaurant since K.B. closed up... But K Asian has an extensive menu that goes way beyond any other place we've seen. We try new things every time and have always been glad. No take-home boxes from that restaurant! ;-)"}
{"text":"Extraordinary Asian restaurant. The menu is vast with Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Chinese influences. The creativity is off the charts. A sushi roll topped with roasted banana? Yep, sure. And it was delicious. I can't tell you what exactly is in the tuna wasabi dumpling I had as an appetizer, but I would like eight or nine dozen more. The Christmas decorations when you walk in are weird (it was early September) but it adds to the charm. The service is incredible, too. I will be back and I will be bringing friends. It's BYOB ($5 corkage) and there is a Wine & Spirits store a few doors down."}
{"text":"K Asian Bistro is fantastic! Really fresh sushi, good service, casual but modern atmosphere. Went here tonight for dinner at 6:00 on a Saturday, husband and I were out for date night. We were seated immediately and ordered the crab spring roll appetizer which was quite tasty. But the sushi/sashimi dinner for two was truly a standout. The fish was VERY fresh and the rice was nicely cooked. Rolls (I believe they were dragon and volcano rolls) were delicious! The actual sashimi and sushi in the dinner was \"chef's choice\" and not specified on the menu but it was all high quality fish and no shrimp, eel, egg, etc. The restaurant is located in a strip mall on Route 8 so don't judge the book by its cover. It is BYOB but there is a wine shop a few doors down and we saw a group of diners near us enjoying a bottle with their dinner. I would highly recommend this place to sushi lovers in the North Hills, skip the places on McKnight Road and come here instead!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  This restaurant is located in a bland, nondescript shopping center anchored by Sears Hardware and Appliance on route 8, hardly a bastion of quality dining restaurants.  There is nothing on the outside that would indicate how modern and nice the restaurant is on the inside.  

I had the Thai Basil chicken.  It was delicious.  It had just the right amount of spice - enough to give it a kick without it being overwhelming.  The chicken was moist and didn't have the dry, blandness taste.  I also had an a la carte roll of eel & avocado - also very good.

My mom had a mango chicken dish called Tropical Mango Sauce.  She is not one for exotic foods, but she loved it.  

The service was the best part.  They were real friendly.  We never had to wait to have a service request accommodated.

The menu is rather large.  If your not into sushi, there is plenty of alternatives - lamb, chilean sea bass, rack of lamb, salmon, filet mignon, shrimp, and veggie options."}
{"text":"First of all. If you are looking for authentic sushi or Japanese food, don't come here. All the staff pretends to be Japanese until I realize that they are secretly speaking Chinese to each other. Secondly, the rolls are OK but the soup, the sushi and sashimi are not great at all. I think they cured the sashimi with salt instead of buying fresh fish. Long story short, if you are just looking for some Asian food, then sure it is fine. But if you want great fresh and authentic Japanese food, don't even bother to come."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it first opened up, never once has there been something we were upset with.

There seems to be something for everyone, the tangy chicken has a slight crisp which is very pleasant and gives the feeling of fresh and home made. The udon is also very pleasant! 

Granted the sushi *is* a bit pricey, rolls such as the paradise roll, which includes lobster and banana in a roll together, certainly are worth it.

The service is always amazing, the food does take longer than most restaurants, but it's nothing to complain about. The servers are always very nice and attentive, and if something isn't satisfactory, you can always let them know! They're more than happy to accommodate for anything

Additionally, they do take out! I wish they could do delivery as well to be honest."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. The ala carte rolls were full of fish. The signature dishes were beautifully presented.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Every visit is spectacular. I so enjoy their tea. I learned the tea is a green tea infused with roasted brown rice known as genmaichi.
Looking forward to another visit soon."}
{"text":"I love sushi. And after Koto Buki in north park closed I didn't think I would find a new place that gave me consistently delicious sushi in the north hills. I was wrong. When K opened we tried it out and were instantly hooked with everything about the place. Delicious food, friendly staff, cool atmosphere. all around great!"}
{"text":"Allison Park & Gibsonia have a thing for fantastic restaurants tucked away in strip malls. 

This place is fantastic. It is far and above one of the best asian restaurants I've been to, and definitely one of the best in the area. They feature lots of traditional as well as signature sushi dishes, as well as Thai and Indian as well. The menu features sushi but has plenty of other options as well. 

The first time I went I had the honey walnut prawns. I expected three or four mediocre shrimp on a sea of rice. I was amazed when the dish featured 8 large prawns, perfectly coocked broccoli and artfully arranged honeyed walnuts. It was fantastic. Everything we've had there has been good to excellent.

The decor is also very tasteful - the neon is there but much more understated than other places.

It is on the small side but you can call ahead for a reservation."}
{"text":"After a second visit, I can say that this will be my go to for delicious sushi from now on. I live in the South Hills and am willing to make the drive to enjoy sushi here any day. I love absolutely everything we have ordered. Everything here is to die for. The sushi is so creative and beautifully presented, the fish is so fresh, and the taste is out out of this world. I've never seen any sushi rolls as creative as K Asian Bistro's. Items from their kitchen are also amazing. 

I highly, HIGHLY recommend K Asian Bistro to anyone looking for fresh, colorful, and flavorful sushi. Another plus: byob!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! Best Kept Secret!!! 
The Bento Lunch Box is an unbeatable value.  I can't believe it!

Excellent Food"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp and stopped here on our way to Ohio. We would highly recommend! The sushi and entrees were fun and delicious, the service was wonderful, and the restaurant and bathrooms were very clean!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  What a hidden gem and god send this is to the area - sick of pizza shops in this town!  Sushi was grade A fresh.  Decor very nice.  Prices - extremely reasonable.  Service - excellent.  You WON'T be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We're vegetarian and the selection for us was great. Very friendly. Very clean. Great presentation. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????Undo??????????????????"}
{"text":"Definitely recommended. A friend passed me a copy of the menu and I was impressed by the creative touch on many otherwise traditional (predictable? boring?) items - a bit of kiwi in a maki roll here, a honey emulsion sauce there. K Asian Bistro does a good job of tackling \"fusion\" without muddling the waters too much. The atmosphere had a little more 80's neon invasion than expected, but it's clean and spare, neat and modern.
All of our food made the grade. We tried the Thai-type Tom soups, and both were fragrant and tasty. The Dinosaur Egg was a funny take on a Scotch egg, made with avocado and crab instead of sausage and egg. My Tokyo roll was wonderful, with perfectly cooked asparagus spears inside. The menu is pretty expansive, so it'll take a couple more trips to get a grip on their variety of items.
The servers are incredibly polite, friendly, and even when service got a shade too busy, were patient and helpful.
It doesn't look like much from outside, but this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We finally got around to trying this place.  I had bookmarked it based on some pretty stellar reviews and was excited to check out their fusion sushi rolls.  The place was pretty crowded for a chilly Sunday night and we were seated right away. 

We had no idea it was BYOB but quickly changed up our sake mindset to hot tea instead.  The tea had a really nice sesame flavor.  

For dinner, we ordered up some King Salmon Sushi pieces and three rolls - a rainbow, an iron chef, and a paradise.  They were all pretty tasty but were cut into HUGE pieces that made it ridiculously impossible to eat in one bite or try and gracefully take half a bite using chop sticks.  Comical but sort of a put off because you want the full flavor of the components of the roll and not piecemeal bits and bites.  Our favorite was the rainbow roll.

The King Salmon was really terrific!  Try that for sure. 

We may go back another time but, honestly, it didn't blow our doors off.  The service was fine but not very helpful.  We asked what the special rolls were and were told they are always they same, Ocean and some other roll name she rattled off and then scurried away.  Maybe she could have sold us more on what the rolls were or what she would recommend.  That would have been a better approach.

Give it a try.  Maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"If you're craving the best Asian in the Deer Lakes District, go to K Asian. Great wall in Russelton and Line Garden on rt. 8 can't compare. Great dishes at good prices and satisfactory service. I love to go there to satisfy my cravings for almost any Chinese food under the sun."}
{"text":"Working in the Gibsonia area is great and all, but we have a serious lack of good places to eat. Yes there are some bigger chain brands here and my favorite \"mom and pop\" place, but aside from that there isn't much variety, and that variety isn't very good. With that being said, K Asian Bistro breaks that mold and brings delicious food and a great atmosphere to the area!

I've only ever gone here for lunch but every time I have very much enjoyed it. The waitstaff is wonderful and comes around often to make sure you are doing good, drinks are full, and that any dishes or garbage(like a straw paper) is cleaned from your table. They really make sure that you have a great experience all around!

I usually will get a bento box lunch special. It comes with soup and salad to start, and the box has a California roll, your appetizer choice, meal choice, and rice. Their salad and soup is like any other hibachi place, with ginger dressing and miso soup. For the appetizer I normally get the edamame which is always good. I have tried the teriyaki chicken and hibachi chicken for the meal part and either are great! If you get the hibachi chicken it comes with their \"yum yum\" sauce which is super yummy! It does come with veggies too! I don't really like California rolls so I will give those to my friend I am at lunch with. I have tried their Dragon roll before and that was divine! They really do have good sushi from what I have tried there and around the area. Only quirky thing is they charge you for more than 1 refill on soda - so beware of that!

This place is worth the try if you are in the area. They have great food and it is something different!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to say my fellow Yelpers were reliable once again. This place is great. The servers are very nice and attentive. The fried rice is delicious... So much flavor and veggies in it!! So is that little iceberg lettuce/ginger dressing that comes as a side. I LOVE that stuff and they had the best I've ever tried. My boyfriend got the steak hibachi meal (served at our table, not a hibachi grill) and it was awesome. I had Pad Thai, which was good but I'll probably try something else next time. The portions and price for both of our meals were right on.

On a Thursday evening, the place was pretty empty so getting seats shouldn't be an issue. I've never been there on a weekend though."}
{"text":"This is a great place, been there twice, going back tonight.  Excellent food, nice atmosphere, good prices, good service.   So glad it is here in this area!  Let's keep it!  I notice it says it's not good for kids in the profile--I think it's fine for kids if they like sushi or pad thai; kids are welcome and the atmosphere's OK for them.  I don't know if they have a separate kid's menu, didn't ask but I'll check tonight."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service and a nice night out in the burbs don't forget to bring your own bottle of wine...."}
{"text":"There are unique selections of sushi including duck rolls that are spectacular. Prices range for shrimp Rangoon mmmm, udon noddles and sushi assortment came to 38 total"}
{"text":"Who knew there was such a great restaurant in a strip plaza on Route 8!  What a nice surprise.  Very creative, trendy menu with so many interesting items, it was difficult to choose.  The presentation and the plates were beautiful.  All four of us liked our meals.  A nice decor with very good service as well as a 10% off coupon when we left.  And, a plate of fresh pineapple cubes at the end.  I didn't care for the brown rice hot tea, but have already spotted several dishes I would like to try when we return!"}
{"text":"My friends, this is without a doubt the best sushi place in the whole Pittsburgh area. We have been going here since it opened and still do regularly. The only better than K Asian Bistro is more K Asian Bistro. Heather, Tina, Hannah are all our favorites! 

Eat here or you're eating bad sushi!"}
{"text":"We really like this place. Staff are super friendly and quick. We have ordered to go many times, tonight we are in with our 11 month old it was a great experience. I had the entree meal for 1 it had sushi and sashimi. My husband had the st Patrick's roll and the black and pink roll with another very good and filling good atmosphere. You should go if you have never been. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Just moved to this area and found this place randomly. Taste above average among other Asian fusion places with $$ on Yelp."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the chicken teriyaki. Was a simple dish but was exceptionally tastey. Waitresses were fairly nice and certainly made sure my water was filled. There is a kick boxing place next door that had music really loud but it wasnt too bothersome. Its not a bad place to get a bite to eat"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for some place near Gibsonia/Allison Park for dinner. I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. 

The interior is well decorated and wasn't tacky at all. It had a modern look with purple mood lighting. Tables were arranged side-by-side with a long bench against the wall and padded chairs on the other side of the tables, so you sit pretty close to other parties that are dining, but it didn't bother us much. 
 
I had a volcano roll and my husband had the spicy tuna. We had no complaints. The rolls were a good size, well-prepared, and tasted good. We also ordered crab rangoons and pork pot stickers. Both were also very good. Prices were all very comparable to what you'd see at other sushi restaurants. I believe the spicy tuna was $6 and the volcano was $13. 

Our only complaints are that the service was a little slow, which seems to be a popular complaint reading the other reviews. We were also surprised to see that there was a charge for refills on our receipt."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. From the sushi to the drunken noodles to the lettuce wraps, everything has been delicious. Service can be a little slow on weekend evenings, but nothing terrible. Everyone is incredibly kind and gracious, so that more than makes up for it. 

Recent discovery, Japanese Sandwich. It is not a sandwich at all and sounds a little crazy, but it is SO GOOD. It's sort of a roll...but not rolled. There are layers of rice and fish and it is just amazing with eggplant and lobster and I can't even remember what else is in it but it is sooo good. 

Also it is BYOB and there is a liquor store next door and a beer distributor at the end of the plaza. Doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Ouch.  Came in for lunch with my dad, for the $16 sushi/sashimi lunch special.  Oh man, I dunno what people are smoking, but the sushi here is really, really bad.

It's yet another fake-sushi restaurant with individually-quick-frozen and haphazardly cut assortments of fish served with bottled ginger, fake wasabi, and bland, watery soy sauce.  You know the type of place; they're everywhere!  They all taste the same and they all have basically the same menus.  Whatever, for $16 I'm not expecting them to fly in live scallops and shuck them right before the meal or anything, but I do expect the meager ingredients to be prepared well.

The miso soup was OK.  Nothing special, pretty much the same pre-packaged stuff you get at any of these kinds of places.

The sushi was really bad.  I know the fish was frozen, but it did not taste even remotely fresh.  It had a weird, mealy texture, the kind that results from, say, ice crystals forming and then thawing after the fish is RE-FROZEN.  Probably why it tasted slightly off, too.

The nigiri was completely screwed up.  The rice didn't seem like sushi, or even short-grained rice.  It was basically Chinese takeout rice.  Thus, it didn't stick together and when I picked up the nigiri, the rice just fell apart.  There was also FAR too much vinegar in the rice.

The spicy tuna roll was unremarkable, other than it being a complete waste of tuna, since all you can taste is the spicy sauce.  Which is probably a good thing here, since the tuna tasted pretty bad.

The sashimi was pretty much inedible.  The texture and flavor were just way off.  Every piece tasted pretty much identical.  There were 4 different kinds of fish but if I was blind, you could have fooled me.

I get this is Western PA and not the coast, but there are places that serve IQF fish competently and cheaply.  Even Giant Eagle sushi is better."}
{"text":"To be honest, I had no idea this was called K Asian Bistro until I checked in on Yelp. I always assumed the logo was someone standing and throwing a boomerang.

Anyway, this place has a lot to offer, despite being nestled in a strip mall next to a Wines and Spirits. If I hadn't dined there before, I might be hesitant about eating at a place that looks kinda sketchy from the outside, but all of the sushi is made fresh and the prices are very reasonable. Basic sushi rolls run $5 or $6, and \"fancy\" ones are $10 to $12 per roll. My partner and I usually split two basic rolls and one signature roll.

Usually there aren't a lot of people here when we go, and service is fast and prompt. However, on Valentine's Day, it was packed. I should've known. Yes, it was crowded, but it took more than an hour for us to get our three rolls. No apologies. No other soups or finger foods to hold us over.

The thing that bothered me most was that it seemed like takeout orders were tripping up the servers rather than dining customers. Those orders seemed to take precedent. Staff would rush to prep things for orders and then sushi rolls and other orders would be sitting in a bag for several minutes until people came to pick them up. Two to three servers staffing the restaurant and handling takeout orders on a busy night just wasn't cutting it.

I think this was an unusual scenario, however, if it wasn't for this experience, I probably would have left a five-star review."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and preparation rival anything you are going to find in Philly or Manhattan.  Service is top notch.  The atmosphere is 'eh' but for a strip mall in Hampton, not bad.  I once had to wait a few extra minutes for take-out, the staff was so nice and they loaded me and my daughter up with a bunch of extra goodies.  Darn.Good.Sushi"}
{"text":"Living right up the road, this has been my Go-To Restaurant for sushi.  
Theirs is amazing to say the least! 
I usually go for the Crazy Friday roll or Two Thumbs Up.  
As far as their entrees go, I have had the sesame chicken, hibachi style rice with shrimp, and about every noodle dish on the menu!
The shrimp portions were fantastic.  
The guest service is also phenomenal.  They make it a point to get familiar with their customers whether you are a Dine-In or Pick-Up kind of person."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall off of Rt 8 right next to Subway, K Asian Bistro doesn't look like much but this place has become my go to sushi stop in the North Hills.   Great for take out after a long day or for dining in, they have a diverse menu of sushi and non-sushi offerings.   My husband typically gets the fried rice and I go with a spicy rainbow roll but everything I've tried has been good and the fish is fresh.

I think their lunch specials are particularly reasonable and come with so much food that I normally have leftovers.   They are also BYOB and there is a state store in the same plaza in case you forgot to bring some wine.   The service has always been pleasant and fast.   Don't let the exterior deter you, this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"If you like Japanese food, you will like this sushi bar.  Be sure to pick up a bottle of wine at the liquor store next door to go with you deliciously presented dinner"}
{"text":"Great place good for a lunch the bento box is worth the price you get a ton of food for only 10 bucks to bad it is only on the lunch menu still very good food the sushi is fresh the staff is very polite and on point."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. The staff are always so friendly and nice and everything is always amazing. The bento box I got today was perfection. Miso soup, small salad with ginger dressing, side of rice, 3 pork gyoza, California roll, and 6 pieces of chefs choice sashimi that were to die for... All for $10!!! Can't beat that. And seriously, the sashimi is some of the best around here I've had. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We enjoy multiple national cuisines, and for  Japanese food, which when well done is always subtly delicious, the K Asian Bistro hits it out of the park.  We were planning to go there for lunch today for Bento Boxes, but I was unable to, so we got take out instead of the Bento Boxes we would have ordered had we gone to eat at the restaurant itself, and both were as delicious and well-made as we would have had had we gotten our order to eat there.  They know Japanese cuisine!!  I plan the next time to do what I haven't so far and that is to try their Thai offerings as well.  Bet they'll be yummy too!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is not. It's hit or miss really. Sometimes ok, mostly just so so. The price is reasonable, though higher than comparable places, esp with the so so service. Maybe it's a language thing... they all probably mean well."}
{"text":"Normally, I like to try lots of new places and rarely feel drawn back to any restaurant in particular, but K Asian Bistro has my loyalty. It's consistently good."}
{"text":"Best Asian in the city of Allison Park/Gibsonia!! Great presentation and great food! One of these times I am going to stop in to sit at the Sushi bar!! Great service! Very quick on their feet!!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this place. Everything was clean and neat. OMG the food was so good. We ordered the sushi special for the day something dancing.  It was big enough for 3 to share as appetizer. We ordered Bento Boxes  yummy!!! I do however suggest you find menu on line and do your homework,so you know what you are ordering. So worth the effort. This is  one of my favorite spots when I go out with the girls."}
{"text":"Bad experience.  12 year old son pulled a huge hair that was in the food from his mouth.  Asked to just take it back.  They billed me for the meal.   I asked to have it removed.  Server said she called the manager and he was willing to give me 50% off his meal that he didn't eat.  Had to wait for a 2nd call and another 15 minutes to call the manager to remove meal.  Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"There were two of us that rolled in and I went along because the other person suggested it. I was really hesitant because I'm judgy when it comes to sushi. We sat down and quickly scanned the menu, which was easy to read. The lighting was nice - not too dark and not loud. We had a waiter who was quick to fill out water and ask what we wanted to order. The person I was with had never tried sushi even though this place was his suggestion.

I ordered two pieces of salmon on rice and we each got an iron city roll. The salmon that came out was a generous piece and it definitely looked and tasted fresh. When the iron city roll came out, I first noticed how nicely it was plated. There was ginger and wasabi (I've been to places that don't include it). The roll itself had wasabi sauce on top so that helped make it extra spicy (yum!) and we both thought it was great. I'll definitely stop here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I tried this place out after a friend of mine who is a chef recommended it to me. He knows the cooks there and says their legit. I'm vary cautious when it come to raw fish because I eat a lot of it but feel vary safe eating anything off their menu. Most of their menu is good to me, but some are a hit and a miss like other restaurants. I especially love that you can get green tea ice cream there becayse it's almost impossible to get it in Pennsylvania. It's definitely worth a try!

Since eating here multiple times, I thought I should revise my review. Last summer my aunt Barb who lives in Japan came to visit. She said the miso soup they make is the best miso soup she had ever had and everything seemed really good. I was really surprised how much she liked it and how authentic she said it was. I thought she would think it was garbage compared to what they have at home but it surprised her."}
{"text":"Lunch special shoppers: Be aware that the bento box special is not available on Sundays! And I don't know about you, but I loose track of the \"names\" of the \"days\" when I'm road tripping. Tip: check the paper at your hotel. 

Our waitress pegged us as budget-conscious due to our interest in the bento box, so she steered us toward selections that would add up to a comparable price. We ordered the spring rolls (fried, delicious, yet small), and a chicken curry. I'm usually wary of curries at Japanese places due to it's over-sweet and goopy. Not the case here! The curry was light and spicy, the chicken tender, and the veggies fresh and crisp. 

When we walked in, we were literally the only people there, but several tables seated while we ate. This was probably at 100pm on a Sunday. We didn't try the sushi, but for some reason I have a feeling it's decent."}
{"text":"Great new Asian restaurant. Have eaten in once and had take out once. Both times the food was great. Huge step up from anything else in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent and will order that again. The pineapple fried rice was mushy and zero flavor. The Orange chicken smelled bad... I don't know if it was bad chicken, sauce or oil from the fryer... my son at one piece and couldn't eat anymore because the taste was just as sour as the smell. Have had ok experiences with this place. I will stick to the sushi"}
{"text":"We drove 20min to come here and it's definitely worth it! Their sushi is so good! Service is awesome too! Black and pink signature roll is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Got a boxed sampler with pork dumplings, brown rice (legit), California rolls, and hibachi chicken. Great idea! The variety was awesome and everything was light and fresh."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Pittsburgh! I cannot eat sushi anywhere else without comparing it to K Asain Bistro. The plating is spectacular as well. Fresh flavors, eclectic options and friendly staff. We have been going to this establishment for years and NEVER had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise to find out that we have our own Japanese restaurant in Allison Park.  It was an even bigger surprise to find out that that it is an excellent restaurant.  Can't speak for the service as my wife and I did take out, but we both got bento boxes and they were wonderful.  Seeing pictures on yelp and on Facebook, you get the impression that the presentation is important to them.  But what we didn't expect was that they even took the time to make the takeout presentation nice.  This is a big change from what we're used to with takeout in the area, where the restaurant basically throws the food into a Styrofoam container.  We will be going back... Again and again and again!"}

{"text":"We love coming for the lunch specials and specialty rolls. Each visit we try a new roll and haven't found one we didn't like yet."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and innovative Sushi and Asian Fusion food. We've eaten here on multiple occasions and each time we have tried different dishes. Everything from the dumplings to sushi creations has been marvelous. It can be busy on weekends but during the week, just walk in and enjoy.
BYO"}
{"text":"Good food, good decor, good price and good service.  Open on Christmas Day - a much needed addition to the dowdy Route 8 places Add in a better bar and a martini menu and you have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The attention to details in this place is impeccable! Food is exquisite, very fresh, presentation deserves 10 stars! We've been coming to this place for over a decade and we're still impressed. 10 stars!"}
{"text":"I went there a couple weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised!  It is BYOB with a small corking fee (which is nice because there is a Wine & Spirits right next door!).  We ordered a few sushi rolls which were SO GOOD and very reasonably priced- and the soy sauce is homemade!   The staff was so friendly and attentive.  The outside of the place looks like any other asian restaurant, but when you go in the ambiance is very cool and modern.  Comfortable seating and new decor made for great experience.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I consider this my favorite Asian cuisine around here. The sushi is incredible and my favorite dish is the lomein noodles. t is a small venue, however I have never had trouble getting seating. I recommend it for anyone looking for a great place to eat with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in the North Hills and my second favorite in all of Pittsburgh. You would never expect it from its location in a strip mall on Route 8, but the sushi is unique and delicious. My favorite roll is one topped with thinly sliced kiwi. Absolutely amazing.

That's not even to say anything about the staff there. They are kind, friendly, and remember us as regulars even though we only are in town for a few times a year."}
{"text":"So yummy! It was such a pleasant surprise to have this in Allison park! I ordered the Thai pineapple fried brown rice with shrimp! It had the perfect amount of spice! My boyfriend got the some sort of noodle dish with shrimp it was just as tasty! Their tea isnt like the traditional tea you get at the other asian eateries around here, it had a lighter nuttier flavor! I can't wait to go back for lunch and try their bento box! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed yet another visit to K Asian Bistro. Ordered my usual, Thai red curry with chicken and tofu, hubby and some got sushi. Also ordered the Indian pancakes as an appetizer this time...phenominal! Plus, our 4yr old tried wasabi(straightyikes) and sushi(which he liked) for the 1st time"}
