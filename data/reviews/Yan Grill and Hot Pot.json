{"text":"We went there couple weeks ago and the food was ok and workers was nice. But hot pot was not too good and everything was over priced. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We went here twice since its opening about two weeks ago, the self cook skewers are just so much fun to watch and the food quality is great! The price is fair and they have add some new dishes onto the menu. The skewers taste even better than the first time which I was already very satisfied. The spicy hot pot is also definitely a worth try!! They put lots of food in the small pot and it worth every penny! I see that they are also working to improve their service, overall it's a better experience and I am excited to know that there will be more food to be added onto the menu in the near future! I will definitely recommend this place to families and friends!"}
{"text":"Had their Skewer and milk tea. Skewers tasted really authentic made feel like home. Their milk tea are not super sweet like other places in town."}
{"text":"Love the hot pot here, generous portions and the kimchi fried rice is the bomb! So good! 
Its my go to place for some hot pot !"}
{"text":"It deserves every second you wait in line! Nice and clean restaurant and friendly servers. I love this place!!! The most important thing is the food was SOOOO YUMMY!!!!! the seafood hotpot is what I die for. The kebobs are decent and YOU ARE BARELY FIND A SECOND PLACE THAT STEW WAS COOK AND ROTATE THEMSELVES AT YOUR TABLE!!!!definitely will come back with my family and friends and refer to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the food, amazing tastes & love seeing in cook right in front of me, & service was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at this restaurant and definitely a unique experience. Quality meats, awesome seasoning and extremely flavorful hot pots. My favorites include: spicy lamb, spicy beef, Taiwanese hot pot and a yogurt drink (or two)! I don't review very often, but small businesses that are original and prioritize high quality food is well worth the money and I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Tried eating here last night but they said they were not accepting new customers even though they were still open.  Came here for lunch at 12:30 and they said they were out of food??  Really?  Second day of opening and they didn't plan ahead with enough food?  They must've not expected any business because that is simply poor management.   Two strikes already and they just opened.  Not a good sign.  Would love to see them succeed as this looks promising but they will have to improve quickly or else customers will not come back."}
{"text":"The Tom yum hotpot here is surprisingly delicious. With plenty of seafood (I am talking about half of real crab, jumbo shrimps and clams) boiled in Tom Yum broth, the flavor is just unbeatable. We ate some kabobs for appetizers as well. The grill for you machine is pretty neat. Definitely will come back to try some other dishes next time."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb! Just as good if not better than many BBQ spots in NorCal. Lamb skewers and beef wrapped in enoki mushrooms were on point, excellent flavors and meat quality. 

Not sure about some reviews with negative remarks on service, however, I have visited this place twice and service was amazing! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby for a date night.. Skewers and Hot Pot under one roof!! I'll be back, Yan Grill had great options and I can't wait to try more. No other place like it in the East Valley. Perfect location, great service, and BOMBA$$ food!"}
{"text":"$50 worth of food for two and we weren't full after. Friendly staff however this is not a place you go to have dinner because you won't be full. The potato skew was a waste of money as it either get burn or doesn't cook all the way. The lamp skew is worth a try. The hotpot would be okay for one person, not the best but it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"Back at it again, and the menu has expanded.  They now have an All You Can Eat option, OYSTERS, And wait for it .... DESSERT!!  Say no more. 

Quality of food is always consistent never disappoints :)"}
{"text":"On a cold evening with friends, there's nothing more comforting than good company and good hot food. There is a large selection of skewers to grill right at your table and a good variety of hotpots to order.
Avoid the potato skewers if you can as they take a loooong time to cook. 

We ordered 1 spicy lamb, 1 spicy beef, 2 beef tongue, 2 chicken, 2 pork belly, 1 chicken heart, and 1 potato skewers. Also, we got the TomYum hot pot and the Spicy Beef pot. There were three of us, and it was way too much food, but we still ate to our heart's content. The food was beyond delicious and the servers were very helpful when it came to grilling the skewers at our table."}
{"text":"All i can say is yummy,yummy and yummy.......the kimchi hotpot is the best..all the meats were tasty and juicy...Definitely will come back again.."}
{"text":"Not going there again. The portion sizes were way to small for that premium price. The hot pots were also really small. I get that it was the first day and all but the service was horrible. There was no communication with the staff on what people ordered so we had to ask multiple times when our stuff was getting out. The food wasn't even that great compared to all the other options you have in that area. When we got to paying, we got fed up asking for the check multiple times and just got to the desk to pay. The lady there ignored us and we had to wait for a manager to pay. Don't even bother with this place."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the southeast corner plaza of Main/1st ave and Dobson rd, this hotpot place offers a unique dining experience. They have an extensive selection of food items from of course, the hotpots to their kebabs. We chose the all you can eat for about $27-30, rounded to include tax. 

There were about 10 of us at the restaurant that evening and they were able to seat all of us together. My tip is to split the group for faster grilling if youre choosing to do kebabs. They have a self-rotating bbq/kebab grill at your table. So naturally, we chose almost every type of meat from lamb to quail eggs! 

Each of us also ordered our own hotpots. It comes in a cute personal bowl with its own fire. They light the fire for you to allow that pot to stay hot! There is no way to control the flame so just watch that hotpot reach its peak heat. I ordered the tom yum. I was slightly dissappointed due to it not being very sour. It probably needs more lemon grass. I took the lemons from my friends drinks and tossed it in there haha. Gotta get creative right?! The pot itself had a lot of shells in it and so I had to pick at it with my chopsticks. 

So you really have to work if you're choosing the seafood type of hotpots. Maybe next time, I'll go for the beef or spicy beef. 

One experience can't account for the entire review, so I'll have to go back. The service was exceptional though. They were so very attentive, they even offered to help with cooking our kebabs at the next table over. TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE! I was very happy about how attentive they were with our waters too! (Lots of spicy dishes).  I will definitely come back due to their unique restaurant style, endless options and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Came this afternoon to spend my 5 year anniversary with the boyfriend. This place is very clean and the employees were very nice and helpful! We ordered the tom yum soup and chicken gizzards kabobs! It was very tasty. We both enjoyed our food. Boyfriend said this is our new spot!


Note: hot pot big enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch special. We ordered the Lamb hot pot and my friend ordered the spicy beef one. Both were super greasy and couldn't really taste the underlying flavor of the hotpots. Also got several skewers - couldn't get the servers to help us with the machines. One the skewers we ordered was the intestines - could definitely taste those were not washed thoroughly. 

And of course both of us got diarrhea later in the day. 

No way am I going back here. ?"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried hot pot, you can't go wrong with Yan Grill. Didn't try the kebabs, but the individual hot pot is delightful. I had the spicy lamb was awesome, such an exciting taste with a good balance of numby and spicy flavors. The included ingredients checked off all my boxes (meat, tofu, crab, mushroom, fish cake etc) and with the included vermicelli noodles I left very full and satisfied. Service was also friendly and prompt, though nothing too above average. Ambiance was comfortable. I also appreciated the easy to read menu. All in all, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was in town for the week and had lunch at Yan Grill, all I can say is that their food quality and service is amazing. Coming from a big city my expectations are hard to please but Yan Grill definitely went above and beyond. I will make sure to come back every time I visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"Runaway Sundays video review of Yan Grill: https://youtu.be/ahIUyqXbFH0

This place at all what you expect inside. There's plenty of seating inside there is a grill in the center of each table where you Cook the food Depending on how you like it. Today I am going to try the beef kebab, beef wrapped in enocchi mushroom, beef wrapped asparagus, shrimp, potato, spicy stir fry noodles, and the beef satay pot. I hope it's good!

Take a look at this short video of our dining experience and food, and you'll have an idea of what to expect! Enjoy and thanks for watching! Let me know if you liked it :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Stumbled on this gem because it was open on Christmas. Service was friendly, and the food was worth the value. We ordered a variety of kabobs, and I ordered the kimchi hot pot. It took a second to figure how to use the grill at the center of the table, but we were roasting kabobs in no time. Just be careful because the hot pots are HOT!!"}
{"text":"New BBQ concept, my friends wants to try that out, it's fun and delicious. 
Loved the chinese sausages fried rice. The table next to us were having hot pot, looks pretty good too, would like to try that next time."}
{"text":"I was running late for a dinner date with family who wanted to try out this new and unique spot. I didn't have to wait and just got to grub. I'm a total sucker for Chinese Hot Pot and the seafood pot was so good! Broth was perfect and it even has clams in it. I freakin love clams!

We also had kebobs, of course! Had pork belly, beef, shrimp, and lamb. I refuse to try lamb but everyone at the table who does eat lamb said it was really tasty. I loved all the other meats and even enjoyed the seasoning on the table used for dipping. I'm usually pretty plain with my food (not usually one to use sauce or seasoning) but I'd highly recommend trying the seasoning by dipping your cooked meat in it. Yum!!!

I realize this is a new restaurant and a new concept for the area so trials and tribulations are expected. I've been to countless Asian restaurants and always go there with patience because good food should take time. If it doesn't, then I'm sure there's a good chance that it was microwaved lol. 

I really thought this place was great fun, especially watching the little kebobs rotate and cook themselves! Funny how little things entertain me lol. Very unique and can't wait to bring my friends here for a fun dining-experience."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant often! Great food great atmosphere and great price! The skewered concept at the table  is so much fun! The owner is very friendly and let me try one of the stiffed mushroom skewers for free. It was so good. They have this bean sauce that's great for dipping the meats in!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never notice this place. It's literally across from Mekong Plaza. Walked in and we got seated right away since we came right when they were open. Our server was so nice. She explained the menu for us since it was out first time. This wasn't my first time eating Taiwanese hot pot. I had it before in Socal and this place is really good. We got tom yum, spicy beef, and shrimp noodles and everything came out perfect. The broth was good and very savory. I didn't get to try their BBQ so I can't speak for that. But the hot pot and noodles was very good. Next time I have to try their BBQ."}
{"text":"The skewers were good but kind of pricey. The service is definitely spotty and the servers get confused on whether or not they have taken your order or what your order was. The hot pots were not great and both my dining companion and I felt sick after eating here. There are better places to eat."}
{"text":"Tom Yum  hot pot, Chinese fried rice,  and grilled meats were delicious.  Cool concept grilling the skewered meat at your table.  Our waiter was good and helped us pick what to eat."}
{"text":"Going here reminds me of Boiling Point in cali because of the hotpot. I was very excited to try this place and it definitely met my expectations. There is an open charcoal grill on the table so you can grill your meats on the skewers. I ordered the steak and pork belly, both were nicely seasoned and tender. I wish there was a bit more than just small chunks though. The Taiwanese sausage was suuuper good and a definite banger. Overall this place is good, I wish I got more bigger meat portions. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We all really enjoyed our dinner at Yan. We had the sausage fried rice and a variety of kebabs. The grill in the table is definitely a neat attraction and makes the dinner more of an event than just a meal. Good place for a date. The food was great, my favorites were the spicy chicken and beef kebabs and the sausage fried rice. Top it off with milk tea for dessert if you've never had it. (I thought it sounded a bit weird, but it was goooood)"}
{"text":"We got some BBQ and fried rice there the night before the grand opening. The grilling facilities were fancy and professional. I love the idea of grilling and eating indoors with smoke and noise minimized, and you can just sit there and enjoy. Moreover, the food was great and not more expensive than their competitors. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I went late on a Monday and it was phenomenal. More than what I would expect for for Arizona. The service was great, our drinks were always filled. We came when there was all you can eat. It's the best you're going to find in Arizona for hotpot and grilling."}
{"text":"Great food and fun dining experience. Kabobs, cucumber salad, and Malaysian noodles - all delicious! We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I came here last night, the food was decent. Especially I love the personal hotspot, the meat they are using was soft and juicy, the shrimps were big too. The server was confusing couple times, but it's understandable, it's their first day anyway."}
{"text":"Enjoying our dinner with friends and feasting on hot pot and skewers.   Just talked with Leo the owner who has shared about some of his restaurant favorites.   Come and enjoy with friends for some Asian food."}
{"text":"The service was bad. They were slow, we had to ask for water and utensils multiple times. We asked for the checks twice. I got food poisoning afterwards. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the food was the service. The portions were small and it was over priced. I normally don't post reviews. However. I felt it a public service to urge you to stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"Extremely slow.Seem to have lost our order. Have served many other tables ahead of us. They seem to give priority to parties of students from ASU."}
{"text":"Customer service is so bad. They tried to keep us stay by leaving the bill and payment for a plenty of time when there's no more customer there till 3pm to charge for dinner portions. They kept stay far away our table, talk to each other, and do nothing. I just got home and noticed this problem. $2 more is not the problem but they were kind of cheating.  Be aware!!!"}
{"text":"Our second visit was just as good as the first. So, it time to up the star power.
Our order consisted of a cucumber salad which has minced garlic and roasted peanuts with cilantro. 
Which is on point, Cool and refreshing. 
Spicy Lamb Pot was even better tasting than our last visit with the kimchi pot, 
I slices of lamb, physical, meatball, clam, steam fish cake, tofu, cabbage the quail egg is a sweet touch, onion and cilantro. Rice noodles. 
Adding the Spicy Lamb Kebab and the Spicy Beef Kebab to top it off. 
Black tea is perfect

The restaurant is exceptionally clean including the bathrooms the service was exceptionally good once again. The atmosphere is nice and it was just as fun as the first.

Look forward to our next visit and exploring the rest of the menu.

{"text":"I like! It's a really new concept in Arizona, kebabs rotate and small hot pots right in front of you!! I ordered their chicken gizzards, kind of spicy but wasn't chewy at all. Their lunch menu seems to be a good deal and their price is affordable. Love it here!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - U2 - One Tree Hill)

We eat Hotpot to face the cold, enduring chill
As the meat burns the grills...on skewers, yum

A flame so bright it leaves no questions
Only marks...cooked into spice on the face of mine

The jig is up and over at Yan Grill
We see the fun go up in our Yelps

I'll Yelp like a singer...on to the stage
I'll Yelp like singer...runs to the stage


Yan Grill is a pretty sweet little Chinese hot pot joint!  At first, I thought it was a place where you had to cook your own ingredients in a hot pot of broth.  However, it's more like a hot stew where you order your choice of soup flavors along with either noodles or rice as a carb base.  

I shot for the BBQ Beef Pot.  The pot came atop chaffing boxes; they lit it up and warm your stew to a boiling level which helps finish cooking your noodles or rice along with the other ingredients.  I love my stew piping hot; almost to the point where it burns my tongue.  The stew came with sliced beef, fish balls, meat balls, steam fish cakes, crab stick, tofu, enoki mushroom, cabbage I'm  Hey , and onions.  Needless to say, it was a meal all in one!  The broth was on the sweeter end so if that's not your jam then get one of the other broths.  

We also ordered some skewers, but I would say that was just more of a flare than taste.  It was fun to watch it cook, but didn't really taste like much except burnt crispy meat.  I would say my favorite were the chicken hearts and least were the lamb kidney.  The skewers were well seasoned, but if you leave it on the flame too long it becomes moot. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The place just opened about 2 months ago We had the Seafood pot and some noodles as our side dish. The staff were very nice and professional And the food was fantastic. I recommend it to anyone who loves Chinese Asia food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food if you love Asian kebabs. The owner Leo is a really nice person. The kebabs are really flavorful marinated. Hot pot broth is flavorful as well. 

Their new all you can eat is a great value. I highly recommend this place. It might even beat all you can eat kbbq."}
{"text":"Well, the app didn't let me do live updates to a review... Anyway, I hate to give this place 1 star but it is well deserved.

1. Value -  This is where the 2 stars come in really. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. Portions are very small. Two kebob sticks for $3.25 average, and some cost more. The hot pot was very small and cost $14 or more. Let's say you order the beef kebobs for $8.95 and a Beef Satay for $13.95, that's like $23 right there. And for $23, it's practically a bowl of soup and a few pieces of meat. Take that money and go to the new Gen BBQ for all you can eat grilled meats at Tempe Marketplace. Or somewhere else for All You Can Eat sushi for like $20.

2. Service - There were a lot of confusion with servers. From the grill not operating correctly to tables not being cleaned to servers coming by trying to take our orders twice.

3. Taste - You know what? The food was decent. We got the Satay Beef and various kebobs. Seasoning on those kebobs were good. And the hot pot was pretty hearty in flavor.

In summary, unless you really want these types of bebobs and hot pot items, you're better off spending your money elsewhere for more food and better service."}
{"text":"Leo the owner did such a great job in creating this joint!Hotpot and skewers are top notch! One stop shop to your cravings needs! The soup are flavorful, the skewers are amazing, and they rotate themselves too! Staff are so nice, price affordable as well! Thanking him in many ways to bringing us more options to the community."}
{"text":"Love Their All you can eat which include both hotspot and BBQ which is the best deal you can find anywhere. The Chinese kebabs are very authentic. Their lamb kebabs are must try"}
{"text":"I just came back from Yan.  It is super delicious.  I had the seafood hotpot.  It is enough for one person, I am totally stuffed.  We tried and lamb and beef kebob, and the flavor is good.  Next time, we will try the all you can eat option.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First thing first: Food is so good! This is the only place in the valley that has such a authentic Chinese kebab thing. Three different seasonings and I love all of them!

Service--I did heisted to go cuz some reviews complaining about their service. But it seems they all agreed the food was good. So I gave it a try. Maybe lowered expectations or I did not go on their first open day. Their service was okay. Not that bad. Kind of slow when I asked for napkins, checks that's where they lost the one star....
If it's only for the food I will give five stars for sure! 

Price-- okay it's not cheap. Real authentic good food always not cheap. Plus I have been to other Chinese kebab places, to be honest... this place is less expensive and bigger portions on kebab size. I have no problem with their price"}
{"text":"Recently went to Yan Grill. We tried their all you can eat, the HotPot are very tasty we order their spicy beef pot which is my favorite of the whole meal it has enough spicy to it. The kebabs are very fun where it rotate by itself. Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"We visited this place on Sat evening based on Yelps's reviews.  This place has a very limited selection on their menu and the kabob is quite plain and pricy.  Low quality meat and doesn't have much taste.  The hot pot just OK.  Nothing special about the food that will bring people back again.  The service was OK since there were quite a few waitress and not many customers.  We will not go back again."}
{"text":"Executive decision to give this place a try for Fathers Day lunch as I heard great things about it. Fellow yelpers weren't wrong. Literally the first ones there as they don't open till noon on Sunday. Greeted by a friendly waitress that guided us to our chairs. Inquire about there all you can eat menu if you want to save some money. Typically the plates range from 8-14 dollars, meat skewers from 2-4 dollars, and can quickly add up if you have large party. Just a friendly tip from yours truly. Since I only had there skewers and majority of the starch and salad choices, everything that I ordered was really good. Definitely would recommend their lamb skewers, cumin chicken bones, and there squid fried rice. I left there satisfied and most importantly satiated with the foods I ate. Can't really go wrong with $30 lunch for all you can eat. Do not call it a buffet as it is not that. Everything made is cooked to order and of course of higher quality. Give it a shot my fellow yelpers, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Restaurant had a good concept, especially with AYCE. But I'm rating it less than average due to a couple reasons. Service was slow when it came taking order and explaining the concept for someone who's never been. The meat seasoning was very bland. There was 2 dry rub seasoning. It can be improved with better meat marination and attention to service. Good concept overall."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to come in to with friends and family for a satisfying dinner in a clean and friendly environment. Very neat to be able to cook your own kebabs to your preference. Menu is fairly priced and you get big meals. Come try this place out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Interesting hot pot and skewer concept across the street from the Mekong Supermarket. An impressive part of the restaurant was the automatically rotating contraption for the skewers; although, as some reviewers have mentioned, the fat will drip into the fire and cause it to flare (you can adjust the grill though). I recommend flipping the skewers around and adjusting the positioning to get an even grill on the ends. Great for pictures/video if you're savvy with social media. We ordered the following:
- Beef Skewers: pretty tasty, except the taco seasoning was slightly strange but it wasn't too strong
- (#4) Seafood Hot Pot: the soup base was very nice and had some sweet notes
- (#3) Satay Beef Hot Pot: more on the rich side, but I would've preferred more meat
Overall, the hot pots were smaller portions than I expected but I would return for the skewers. They just added an All-You-Can-Eat option for around $27 for dinner."}
{"text":"I and my friends are regular customers here. They messed up my orders a couple of times but I was fine with it. Until yesterday, we came in for lunch hour and expected to pay for lunch hour prices. After we finished eating, the lady gave us our check. We got our cards and cashs ready (visible to them) right away but they never came to pick it up. Until I had to say out loud, \"We are ready to check out\". During that time we were waiting for them to check us out, the lady and the gentleman who were standing and talking at the register the whole time. But I didn't want to interrupt them. If I realized we were passing the lunch hour frame I would have interrupted them already. Although it was our fault for not noticing the time, I still felt like they tricked us because after giving us our check, they never came to check back on us. Which was unsual because they always checked us out fast on our previous visits. 
Honestly the food is alright, but it's way overpriced for the amount of meat they serve. Their soup always come with a lot of cabbages...
Also the way they serve hot tea with hard plastic cup, I hope no one will get burned in the future. 
I hate to be back here."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The Spicy Lamp got pot is to die for! We tried a little bit of everything, and it was all great. They have Boba tea, beer and saki."}
{"text":"I grill, therefore I am.
--Alton Brown

We came here to try out their grilled items. There's a decent variety of lamb, beef, chicken, and vegetables to choose from, with some unique offal options such as lamb kidneys and pork intestine. After browsing through the menu, I got 4 items: enoki mushroom wrapped in beef, Taiwanese sausage, lamb kidneys and chicken hearts. Each order was around $3 or a little over. I also had the Beijing yogurt drink. 

The grill works on an automated track system which moves back and forth. The skewers have a cog at the ends to line up with the track so that your skewer rotates evenly. The grill seems to use lava rocks on the bottom along with a gas burner to cook your food. When the server turned on our grill we oohed and ahhed at the cool flames dancing around the rocks. There's an overhead hood too which keeps your table from getting too smoky and your clothes from smelling like you just volunteered as a fireman to put out a burning building. 

I got the Beijing yogurt first. You basically get a container the shape of a tallish yogurt cup but you drink it instead of using a spoon. It had a medium consistency and I enjoyed the balance of mild tart, sweet, creamy and rich flavor. I think normally at one of the Asian grocery stores here you can buy it for $2 so I'd probably just get it from the store next time instead of paying $3.50 here. 

\"You don't want flame to hit your food. Flame is bad. Flame does nasty things to food. It makes soot and it makes deposits of various chemicals that are not too good for us. The last thing you really want to see licking at your food while it's on a grill is an actual flame.\"
-- Alton Brown

Oops! When we had the skewers on the grill there was quite a bit of flame that hit our meat as some of the fat dripped onto the bottom causing flare ups. It did make for some thrilling fiery entertainment though! (As a side note, tying any long hair back would be a good idea unless you would like an accidental hair flambé) My one gripe about the grill is that it heats your food unevenly. The ends of the skewers would be raw while the center would be cooked, so with a few of them I had to take out the center portion of meat, shove the ends into the center, and then continue to cook. I found this out the hard way when I removed the skewers on the chicken hearts to find that the center portions were perfectly cooked but then I bit into a raw heart that was at the end of the skewer. Hello salmonella! 

The meats I enjoyed the most were the beef wrapped enoki and the lamb kidneys which were marinated in a spicy sauce.

My other gripe is that for the amount of money I paid for the skewers I don't feel like I got a lot of food. After paying around $20 for my meal post-tip I was still hungry. 

If I go here again I might try the hotpot but I'll skip the skewers unless I'm combining a few small skewer bites with the hotpot."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and Service! I had a young gentlemen help me and he was so fast and so nice. Everyone should go here!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place opened. Coming from Cali, I've been so upset that there weren't any good hot pot places nearby. The BBQ beef hot pot was tasty. We got the beef skewers. Barbecuing them on the rack was interesting and it tasted great too! They use charcoal in the grills so it gets a nice BBQ flavor. Will definitely come back! Keep in mind that the hot pot portions are generally for 1 person and I've seen people share 1 too. I've been seeing a lot of reviews complaining about the price. Honestly, it is comparable to the hot pot places in Cali. Similar to boiling point. Skewers are generally not cheap so I'm happy with the quality, taste, and novelty of grilling the skewers on a automatic rotating grill. With what is available in Arizona, best place in my opinion for hot pot."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Yan Grill and Hot Pot for dinner tonight. When entering the restaurant you first notice that there are a lot of ventilation stacks over the top of all the tables. There's not somebody immediately available to seat you, so you don't know if you should just go sit at a table or wait. The majority of the clientele this evening was Asian. The menu is a two-sided 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper, laminated. The menu selections have a variety of selections that start out at about $14 for A hot pot which is a bowl, filled with a variety of different things that maybe very delectable to some and not so delectable to others. I decided to go with the lamb kebabs, potatoes, and corn, As for one I didn't want to spend the $14 for hot pot for ingredients that didn't make sense to me. I decided to go conservative with my order. I did not order a drink, but had water. My mail arrived and the waitress placed several of the skewers. That's how the meal was served all on skewers. On the hot grill in the center of my table. She basically indicated without saying so how to maneuver the skewers, so that they would work on the rotation device. She did not say anything about it being hot, or caution me to take care when working with the skewers. She left and I proceeded to cook my meal. After about the third or fourth skewer. I was having trouble removing the meat from one skewer as it was very condensed on the skewer and difficult to remove. I inadvertently placed my finger in the hot zone of the skewer and subsequently burned my finger. When I believe it was the owner came to my table to check on how my meal was going indicated that I had burned myself. He was concerned for me and listen to my concern for not only the grill being very hot. But also the skewers being very hot. I indicated that if children were manipulating the skewers that it might be very likely that they could burn themselves as well as other adults. Knowing that this was a very delicate situation, he offered me a free drink, and I accepted. It is difficult with a situation like this not to be very critical of the operations of the business. I am very concerned for future patrons burning themselves on the skewers and would highly recommend that they look into having chef's or trained personnel work the tables and the grills, so that they can avoid this in the future as they have made quite an investment in every table having its own grill and ventilation system. I gave them a chill mostly because of the food being very little food for the value that I paid. And also my experience. In particular the potatoes that I ordered even when cooked on the grill were still raw. I think there's a lot a possibility with grills of this type and people cooking their own meals to have under cooking of food. This is why highly recommend that they look into having chefs accommodate the tables or highly trained personnel. I think this place has the opportunity to be a very fantastic place to have a meal at sometime in the future when they take action to address the safety concerns that I had this evening. It appeared to me that other patrons were enjoying the food, and I would have to say that very likely the food is quite delicious. I tended to feel that the corn was underseasoned, and the potatoes even when cooked on the grill were still under cooked. My lamb was delicious. So I hope that the next time I visit they will have taken action to address these concerns. Lastly, the waitstaff requires some additional customer service training, as my table was not serviced before my tab was presented."}
{"text":"Great place for hot pot and skewers what else can you ask for plus they have beer!! 

The price is affordable and the owner is nice.

If your adventurous and love Asian food try this place out"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight in a girls night out. We wanted to try something new. Ummmm yeah wish we never did. We ordered the beef HotPot .... no flavor... kimchi fried rice I don't even know what that tastes like. Sure wasn't  kimchi fried rice though and it was so greasy. We ordered skewers to be exact... spicy beef, spicy lamb, gizzards, pork belly, beef wrapped in enoki mushrooms, potatoes, jalapeños, egg plant and steamed bun. Out of all of those the speak bun was prolly the best with the condensed milk. We didn't like that you couldn't tell what meat was what. They should really mark the skewers some how do you know what your eating. On that note everything tasted the same just a different meat. They should try different marinades not sure if I was missing something with the flavors all being the same. Our grill was either to hot or turned off so half out meat was chard. Yup don't think we will be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Server Dalia was so nice! The hot pot broth is very flavor full I wouldn't recommend the kabobs they re bland and expensive . The chicken liver has no flavor  :/ pork belly was good tho"}
{"text":"Super awesome food and it feels like back home!!! Personalized hotpot so we can order more and more variety! The skews are so delicious too! Highly recommended for his place!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to Yan Grill and Hot pot for lunch.

I ordered the Spicy hot pot and she ordered the Seafood hot pot. 

Surprisingly, I thought the hot pot was going to be bigger but it was small. The photos on Yelp makes the pot look a lot larger. 

The lunch special came with Green Tea, but it didn't come with refills.

My soup had lots of flavor the spice was just perfect. 

I tried my friends soup and next time I'll order the Seafood Hotpot I wanted something spicy but the seafood one was also yummy."}
{"text":"Rotating Skewers and Hot Pot! 

I haven't seen any restaurant like this before (except in Cali). I'm always hesitant to go to grilling places because its usually full of smoke, loud blowing vents, and you come out smelling like BBQ. But this place was the opposite. Each table has their own quiet little vent. The grills used coconut shells so there are no fumes, therefore not a lot of smoke or bbq smell once you leave. Don't get me wrong, the food smells and taste great! It still has that grilled flavor like charcoal. 

We ordered a little bit of everything to try. Spicy beef, pork, lamb, chicken hearts, intestines, enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef and pork, buns, and some veggies. All of them were seasoned with authentic Chinese flavors which was good on its own. You can dip it into their extra three seasonings that they gave for extra flavor. I haven't tasted these flavors for a long time. So I'm very excited to make this my new Chinese spot. My favorite is the mushrooms wrapped in pork and the buns. Basically, you put them on the rotating gears and you let it cook as long as you'd like. If you like extra crispy, leave it on longer, if you like the raw, take it off sooner. Theres a rack on the top where you can place the already cooked things on top to keep them from burning but stay warm if you make too much at once. 

We tried the Taiwanese Satay Hot Pot. It has a bunch of veggies and meat slices and fish balls all in numbing sichuan spicy soup with a bowl of rice or some noodles. Each bowl is personal sized with a cute little flame underneath. The bowl looks small, but its definitely filling enough for one person to eat alone or enough to share if you are also getting a few skewers. Its worth the price, especially if you compare it to some other hot pot places in the Valley. 

The servers weren't too bad when I went, so they must have improved a lot since their grand opening day. I'm expecting them to keep improving since all servers flounder the first couple days of a brand new restaurant.  They said they are adding more to the menu, which I already can't wait to try! I take this as a soft opening and this gem is only going to get better and better. 

Environment: 5/5

{"text":"This hot pot place hits the spot!!! Writing a review about it, makes me hungry thinking about it hahaa..the servers are really nice. I had a big group when I went and all of us got taken care of, and all of our food came out hot and fresh."}
{"text":"2 stars is being really generous. The skewers were dinky and expensive(avoid these). They have the smallest hot pot I have ever seen. We ordered the Tom Yum and it tasted like instant soup flavor mix. Honestly, the hot pot in Mekong is better and that's not saying much. The kabobs were just a rip off. Blah."}
{"text":"I really like small hot pot, it's good for a person. I got beef satay and Taiwanese spicy hot pot, great service also."}
{"text":"Fun for grilling at the table and private hotpot. 
It's hard to figure out what your eating so bring a friend who speaks Chinese."}
{"text":"Very traditional and authentic Chinese kebab! Exactly the same as what I had in China. The food tasted good and the meat was juicy. I like the way how to grill the meat and it was so much fun. I also ordered the hot pot. It's a Kebab restaurant not a hot pot restaurant.  The price was also reasonable for that size. The service still needs to be improved but it's understandable because they just started."}
{"text":"My wife, her nephew, and I went to Yan Grill and Hot Pot yesterday for lunch.  The food was okay.  It was the typical Asian style grilled meat place.  

My wife had a seafood hot pot.  I had the lamb hot pot.  Tam, the nephew, had tom yum hot pot.  The hot pot was a bit salty.  

In addition to the hot pot we ordered an assorted array of skewered meats for grilling.  It seeks as though the pork belly irritated Tam, as he has been experiencing some stomach issues as a result of eating the grilled pork belly.  As far as the other choices of lamb, beef, and shrimp, they were okay.  Tam was saying that some of the meat tasted old (even when properly grilled).  

I think that perhaps this would have been better had the soups been less salty, and we did not have stomach issues with the food."}
{"text":"This became the best part of my Arizona trip (although I was not excited to meet my in laws lol) . The food , the people there ... it was just amazing. My wife has been talking about this place for a while so thought I'd check it out on this trip... Mann oh Mann !!! We ended up ordering lots of kebabs.... spicy lamb (my fav) , spicky chicken, pork belly, pork intestine , shrimp and it was all very good and well flavored. Something about food on stick over the charcoal and beer on the side just brings out the biggest smile on me and this place did that...  the soup thingy (hot pot) and the noodle was good as well , not to diminish their importance to ppl who love it...The servers were friendly and very professional as well .... just for the sake of an expeeience one should try this place once and I am pretty sure you would agree to my experience...  I am already ready to come back and try this place on my next visit..."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night around 6 and found the restaurant pretty empty with only 2 other tables occupied. By the time we had finished, there were only one more group that came in. This worries me but we were set on trying this place out. 

We ordered few meat skewers including pork belly wrapped enoki mushrooms, beef tongue, and spicy lamb. I have to say the skewers were tiny with teeny weeny cuts of meat. It was also overly seasoned to a point where you couldn't tell what kind of meat it was. 

In theory, the bbq should be self cooking because it rotates automatically. However, we quickly realized that this wasn't the case  and needed constant tending to. The flames were hard to control and the meats didn't cook evenly even after constant manual flipping and rotating. The flames ended up just making the meats all black without cooking. Our waitress assured us it was cooked, but it wasn't. It was raw inside. We ended up throwing them in the hotpot to cook. 

We ordered spicy lamb hotpot. This was the highlight of the evening. The broth was perfect and had lots of vegetables, mushrooms, tofu and such. This also came with dipping sauce that was really good. 

Next time, I will skip on the bbq, and go for the hotpot. These hotspots are large but serves one, so order different hotspots and share!"}
{"text":"The personalized HotPot here is probably the most delicious I've had in this area. The TomYum is so flavorful, between spicy and a hint of sour. Plus, my mother loved it, and she's quite the picky eater. The HotPot is more than enough for one person, and it comes with several tasty items, such as fish cakes, fish balls, crab, squid, and others (TomYum specifically). $15 for dinner is not bad for how loaded it comes. HotPot is definitely a 5/5 for flavor and filling! 

The grilled kebabs fell a little short for me; although, the overall concept is cool and the meat selections are decent. Coming out of there not smelling like BBQ from smoke is a major plus. We ordered several kebabs: chicken, beef, spicy beef, lamb, Taiwanese sausage, fish balls, shrimp, pork belly wrapped enoki mushroom, and Chinese bun. I recommend the pork belly enoki and spicy beef! Beware of the Chinese bun though, because if you're expecting a soft bun, similar to the char siu bao (minus the pork), you will be disappointed (like me). It had more of a firm and semi-crunchy texture; quite different. The seasoning on the meats were authentic Chinese flavors and not overwhelming, although portions are quite small.

Kimchi fried rice, special Chinese sausage fried rice, and Malaysian rice noodles were all good. Nothing too special, but worth ordering if the kebabs are not filling enough for you!

Service was a little disorganized, but i think it might be because they've got a few people covering the floor yet no specified sections/tables. We were well taken care of when someone did come by to check up on us, but they seemed flustered more often than not during interactions. Servers were nice and helped us start our kebabs each round that we ordered, but a little more organization on when to check on tables will definitely improve service so customers aren't waiting 15-20 min. for a water refill or to order more food :("}
{"text":"Best hot pot place in Arizona and I would highly recommend. I would even say that it's better than California's Boiling Point. The hot pot here is packed with flavor and contains plenty of meat/sides. I ordered the Spicy Beef pot and it was delicious! Furthermore the service here was surprisingly very friendly and super accommodating to your needs/orders. I came here with a group of 10 and they didn't complain at all or automatically charge us tip (even though I gave them a 20% tip for their service). They even allowed us to pay separately (which is understandably a huge pain for restaurants). 5/5!!!!"}
