{"text":"Boccavino has recently been sold and has gone downhill since the sale! The new management group has increased the prices and brought in a new chef/cook. My wife and I were regulars for wings on Wednesday and they have changed recipe for the sauces on the wings, as well as the mista salad (both for the worse). We will not be going back, which is unfortunate as it used to be great value for very good food and service!"}
{"text":"I really like Boccavino a lot. The place has a lot going for it- great location, pleasant staff, consistently tasty food, overflow parking, plus it's supplied by Lina's Italian Market next door, which speaks for itself. The thing that always gets me when I dine here is that it's such a 'sports bar'. It's noisy, they're many large-screen televisions. This completely ruins any ambiance there may have been. I believe that Boccavino would be much better known, and perhaps cater to a wider audience, if they didn't tote it like a sports bar. I believe it's better than that."}
{"text":"Fifteen of us went this place on Saturday and we ordered a variety of food to share among us. Everything was very good and I was quite impressed with this place. Calgary Transit bus #3 stops across the street to ferry us to LRT downtown. The bus comes every 10 minutes around 9:00pm. Having eaten all sorts of food and took beer and wine, each of us paid $40, including 20% gratuities. Would like to visit again!"}
{"text":"It amazes me that there aren't more reviews for this restaurant considering how busy it can be sometimes.  Well, let's add another shall we? I have been to this restaurant about a half dozen times so far.  My first visit actually came about because of a gift certificate I won.  To be honest, I almost never go to that area of the city, so I likely never would have known they existed otherwise, and that would have been a shame. Simply put, the food is fresh, good, and quite reasonably priced.  The only criticism I can offer about Boccavinos is that it can be a long wait to get a table sometimes as they simply aren't that big, and that the decor has always struck me as a little strange - bar, big screen tv, dim lighting, fireplace?  Are we aiming for a romantic sports bar or something? Ignoring my decor dilemma, I'd still recommend a visit as the food is great, reasonably priced, and the service is good. Just don't go on a Friday or Saturday night ok?  The line up is already long enough and I want to eat!"}
{"text":"Located on Centre Street N near the Mount Pleasant area, Boccavino is a convenient for both NW residents, and people heading out of the downtown area looking for a bite. An Italian style pub, Boccavino has a full menu, but there are no minors allowed. Which frankly, I appreciate sometimes. The interior of the pub isn't exactly stunning, but it works. Comfortable booths line the walls, and tables stand in the centre of the pub with a large fireplace in the middle. You can also sit at the bar if you're dining solo. Boccavino gives the impression of being a sports pub, with jerseys and other sports memorabilia on the walls, and multiple TVs playing multiple games at a time. But the crowd comes for the food, not for the games. So don't let the d√©cor fool you!The staff at Boccavino are always friendly and accommodating.   The menu is large and plentiful. Which can sometimes indicate that the food will be sub-par, because the kitchen can't possibly stock enough fresh meat and produce to make food to order, or have enough time and manpower to make 100 different things at once *cough BostonPizza cough*. But Boccavino pulls it off. Maybe it's because they are supplied by Lina's Italian Market next door, or maybe they are just that amazing. But I've rarely if ever been disappointed by the food, and I think I've eaten there over 30 times.  After trying a wide selection of items off the menu, I will recommend a couple of my favorites. Starting with the appetizers, the calamari can't be beat. It's literally the best I've had anywhere in the city. It's tender and covered in a flavorful tomato sauce. In close second is the caprese salad. Fresh tomatoes and soft mozzarella cheese in an oil and balsamic dressing with lettuce, capers and olives.   In terms of entrees, my favorites are the penne a la arrabbiata; a spicy vegetarian pasta with a ton of fresh vegetables in a zesty sauce and perfectly al dente pasta. I also love all of the veal dishes they have. The veal is always cooked well, and the stuffed potato on the side is salty and satisfying. Hands down, the best dessert is the tiramisu. Creamy and rich, yet not heavy and overly sweet, this dessert is a must-try at Boccavino.  If you haven't tried Boccavino, consider it for your next weeknight dinner. If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait for a table because they do get very busy. But it's worth the wait if you have the patience!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Food and drinks were very well priced for what you get. Very authentic tasting italian food with lots of menu options. There is a bar and tv's around playing sports, so you get the variety of drinks and a little pub feel. No kids allowed also which is great for dates. The crowd seemed to be mature and no one looked under 30, except myself. The waitress we had wasn't overly friendly but the other servers looked to be better. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Hmmm, for a sports bar Boccavino's is always incredibly busy. It does not take reservations because it is a sports bar, and due to a variety of issues I am four for four for showing up with a decent sized party (three to four) and not being able to get a seat in a reasonable period of time or getting turned away entirely (we had a seventeen year old minor). Although the staff have always been polite about it, it is getting kind of frustrating. I keep hearing amazing things about the menu, that it is way better than sportsbar fare. And I have tried the food when a friend brought some for me when I was sick, but I was looking forward to, you know, actually picking my own dishes and eating them freshly prepared.   The decor is some sort of strange sports bar-italian eatery-lounge hybrid. The cold pasta I had was decent, but I'm thinking it was a far cry from the real thing. I've kind of given up on Boccavino's because it takes too much energy to go only to get turned away.   I guess my recommendations are: don't go on wing night, remember that it is not a family restaurant (even if your almost legal relative promises not to drink or be served alcohol), and calling ahead to see if they are busy."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here before?  Because the exterior makes Boccavino look like a small and dingy bar could be hiding behind those doors.  I was completely stunned when my spouse and I dropped in for dinner for the first time last night.  It has extremely high ceilings, it's bright, clean and friendly.  We had the most amazing server who was all smiles.  I love the restroom area, as the walls are plastered with sports and celebrity photos.    We ordered drinks and  I nearly fell off my chair when I realized my martini was going to be less than $6 and my spouse's rye was less than $4.  Score!  We tried the calamari which was perfectly done and not breaded.  We both had the special, which was Chicken Neptune with your choice of side.  My stuffed potato was incredible but loaded with some serious garlic.  You don't always notice such things until the gluttony has stopped.  I'm sure our chicken was at least 6-7 ounces.  We definitely got our money's worth.    Apparently Boccavino is typically lined up on Friday evenings but we lucked out and were seated right away, which was around 6pm.  It was very busy by 6:30pm.  Now that I'm enlightened, I'll have to watch out for more weekday specials and stop in again.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I went here with my Mom the other night and it was... AWESOME!  I was really surprised at how nice Boccavino was when we went there.  This place has got your pretty basic Italian menu; pasta, pizza, gnocchi, etc.  The pastas that my Mom and I got were super delicious.  The rose sauce was especially tasty, as was the garlic-cream sauce they had!  We were started with bread rolls which we a nice addition to the wine we ordered, which was on special that night.  Our waitress actually asked if we'd like to order a salad to share, which I thought was an interesting suggestion.  We didn't go for it, but I thought it was smart of her to ask anyways.  I also really like the inside of the place.  It's got a good amount of decorations and wall designs, with just enough to keep the eyes entertained but not be distracting.  There was just enough sports stuff on the walls to satisfy the fans but not too much as to make it seem like a sports pub.  Considering it's very open layout, I was surprised that it wasn't too noisy (despite being pretty busy) and my Mom and I were able to carry a conversation, without feeling that other people were listening as well.    Seriously, overall, my time at Boccavino was absolutely awesome and I'm definitely going to be going back soon.  I just loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Like others, have been to this restaurant many times, but my first review for it. Nothing but positives to say, when reviewing the restauant for what it is (I'll circle back to that).  The staff is always great. The last time we got there was early (dinner-wise) on a Saturday night, and you could tell staff were 'getting psyched up'. We had marvelous, fast and friendly service. This is one of those places where the staff actually listens to what you are saying, rather than being on automatic.  Food was great, great, great. I wouldn't recommend manning a kissing booth after eating here, but fresh, tasty and I wasn't told \"Careful, the plate is hot!\" (which is restaurant speak for 'been under warmers for a while\").   Great selection on the menu, and prices are right where they should be. As mentioned, minors aren't allowed (and I agree, appreciated sometimes).  A lot of people have mentioned that this restaurant is a bit 'bi-polar' in terms of what it is trying to be, look-wise. It is half sports bar/half fine dining. I suppose, if it's working, keep going with it. I guess the downside is that when you have someone there drinking beers watching the Flames, dinner parties aren't going to get seated.  Yes, it gets busy, likely due to the fact it is one of the better restaurants in that part of town. So, get there early, especially if a big game is on."}
