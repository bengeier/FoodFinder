{"text":"Best fish and chips I've had in Toronto - staff was friendly and service was fast. Fish was fresh and portions were big. The place was clean and looks newly renovated. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Good old English style fish and chips place. I like spending my 2 cents on small places than giving them to McShit and cronies"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. My grandparents took my girlfriend and I for a late lunch. They have been going there for years and I see why. They do fish and chips proper. Very fresh good quality halibut and tasty fries. Very good pricing as well. I believe our bill was under 40 dollars for 4 of us and we dined in. Ernie and his grandson Andy are also very friendly and nice. Great customer service which is hard to find these days.  Great experience overall and definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips on the Queensway. Haddock and Halibut were fantastic. Lightly battered and perfectly prepared. Best crush cut fries I've had in a long time.   The owners were exceedingly friendly to my daughter and really left a lasting impression. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I have ever had! It's so fresh and not oily like other places. The food just melts in your mouth! I'd recommend the seafood platter :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a better review cause the interior is so cute and the staff are really nice but honestly,  the food is not great. It's not awful, and the prices are reasonable but my scallops are way over cooked and really chewy. My husband was also disappointed with his wee small portion of halibut but tells me it's pretty good. Nothing is super greasy and the batter is good. So all in all, not awful for the price but not good enough for us to return."}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips. Perfectly battered, moist and juicy. Friendly service. Only drawback is no liquor license."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and never been disappointed. The portions are just right for me - a big piece of fish and a couple handfuls of chips - and when you ask for the fries well done, they are.  The halibut is great, and I like their onion rings."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the fish and chips where fabulous. I would have givin this place 5 stars because the fish and fries are that good. I did not however because I do feel the portion size is a little small and a little pricey for the amount you get."}
{"text":"This is the best Fish and Chips in Toronto!  Yes, better than the late, great Penrose Fish and Chips.  The halibut is so fresh and the batter is so light and crispy, that you want to keep eating more!  And the chips are perfect too!  The restaurant is clean and modern, despite that the family owned business has been around forever!  I make my way to Etobicoke every chance I get!!!"}
{"text":"I love the new look of this place. Feels very appropriate and the place is clean. Staff is very friendly. Get the coleslaw with the fish&chips. It's a must!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips quality not bad and staffs are friendly but the reason I gave 3 because quantity is very poor except chips.  Fish is one piece and you need two of that size to have a meal. Clam chowder very small size comparing the price. Coleslaw was not that good, not juicy.   Also expected good tartar sauce, not those take out small packs like ketchup."}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews for small businesses but I wish I went to Harvey's :(  the people Are very friendly but they forgot my coleslaw and my gravy. When I got  to work to eat it they gave me malt vinegar for my halibut! No lemon wedges either. The fries are the only thing I can eat and they are nothing to brag about. The halibut is very greasy too"}
