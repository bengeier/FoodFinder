{"text":"Went here the other night. The service was fine, our waitress was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was pretty great with really nice, dim lighting and the decor is very cozy and intimate. The food on the other hand was extremely lack-lustre. I had the shrimp skewers and they were very dry and stringy with undercooked roasted veggies and a mound of dry rice. My friend had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was just so plain and lacked flavour. Yes the food is cheap, but my dinner wasn't even worth the 8$."}
{"text":"Excellent place to start your diet.  Guaranteed not to finish your meal. Suitable for people who hate food, or themselves, or both.  Miss terrible cuisine from the 70s? Now you don't have to!"}
{"text":"Good music, not too many hipsters, no snarky staff that we saw and delicious sweet potatoe fries and quesadillas. Also, my feiend seemed to really enjoy the beer."}
{"text":"Great sweet potato fries with my eggplant sandwich. Fantastic service . Good beers on tap. Great music. Outdoor seating. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the city!   If your looking for a great experience, excellent service, delicious food at incredible prices- this is the place to be!  Peach mojitos were bomb!"}
{"text":"A friend and I popped in to Templeton's at random one weekday afternoon and ended up with the best service I have had in a long time.    There was an issue with my friend's meal, which could turned the whole experience sour.  Instead, the chef AND server (Josh) took swift and courteous action to  correct their mistake.  They went well above and beyond my expectations.    Aside from the phenomenal service, the place is itself is cute and cozy with a nice atmosphere.  It's all dark wood with a vintage-y feel.  The food is really reasonably priced (around $10 a plate or less) and they serve breakfast until the late hours of the afternoon.   Their menu is quite eclectic with a leaning toward Asian dishes.  That said, they also serve bacon & eggs, nachos, and burgers.  It all looks good.  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We tried the eggplant sandwich and the rice and shrimp. Both we very reasonably priced. The ambiance and ecclectiness also was quite cool."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. We were a group of 6 walking having a long weekend in Toronto. We had been walking around the city all day, and were ready for a cocktail around happy hour time. We walked into this lovely place and were greeted warmly. The 2 severs, one from Barcelona and one from Acapulco, were so friendly and accommodating. We had a couple of \"Caesars\" - what we call Bloody Mary's in the states. We got them extra spicy and they were Amazing!! Nice selection of beers also. We just got some appetizers which were just fine. The fries with chipotle mayo were awesome!"}
{"text":"I was greatly surprised walking into this place on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm. The tiny restaurant/bar was half full and had a great air about it. I ordered the 9$ pad Thai - which I found to be stellar :)  My only complaint was the lack of diet coke."}
{"text":"Great food. amazing prices, service is lacking.  Had snacks and drinks here on a Saturday afternoon.  Food was really tasty and portions were good considering the low prices.  Brie fritters were cheesy good, nachos weren't bad for $6, and the burger with side of sweet potatoes fries were as good as any pub's.  Service was the only negative about this place.  There were three employees working both the bar and serving tables, but they spent most of the time we were there standing at the bar and chatting and did not pay much attention to their tables.  Most tables, us included, ended up looking around impatiently to get some service, a bill, a drink, etc.., and even that didn't draw the attention of the staff.    Overall I would definitely recommend for drinks and casual eats, but would like to see the service improve to really make this a great place to spend some money at."}
{"text":"Best drink specials. A little dusty.. and dirty gem in Kensington."}
{"text":"Keep coming back here for the Paella. So good. And also love the Eggplant pesto sandwich & Japanese salad. Prices are so reasonable that it's not hard to make it a routine hangout."}
{"text":"Thinking it was still the Burger Bar, we went here expecting to have an awesome burger. The waitress told us:\"It's no longer the Burger Bar, but we do make great burgers\" No kidding!!   She should have called them the best burgers in town. Forget Burger Priest, go to Templeton's instead. I wanted every bite to last an eternity!  Make sure you get fries with it. I can't remember ever having better fries. I know it sounds weird that one can be enthusiastic about fries.....but don't judge until you try them. Comes with a yum dill sauce.  $4 drinks are a nice bonus. I've been holding myself not to go here every day! :)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner tonight...the menu is interesting and I appreciate the kindness of the people who served us."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when we had hoped to go somewhere else in the K but had to look for an alternative. It was not busy (quite empty on a Tuesday night) and had a chill vibe so we stepped in here.  Friendly server/bartender greeted us and took care of us right away. What really confused me was when I asked her about a particular drink, she said she had never tried it... wha? Aren't you the one making the drink? That's like a pilot saying he's never flown. Anyhow, we ordered the jug of Caipirinha which was refreshing but more like flavoured water than the real deal. So, okay, maybe comparing it to the caipirinha I had in Brazil is a little unfair, but this was almost like a diluted mojito.   We tried the tacos and avocado eggrolls - both were decent as simple snacks to munch on.   The Templeton itself didn't particularly enhance our night (we left wishing we had boozed up a bit more) but perhaps because we were just having such a nice date night, I have a fond impression of the place and would not be opposed to trying it again.   Atmosphere - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Food/drinks - 2.5/5 Price - 4/5"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is trendy and comfortable with a ton of character but that is the only reason to ever go to this restaurant. I had a bland, over priced caesar with chicken skewers, unseasoned rice and incredibly under cooked vegetables. The meal was intensely underwhelming and the peanut sauce that came on the side of my dish was the only factor of flavour to the entire meal. I will say that I did not try their sangria or other drinks that come in pitchers. That may be the reason for the busy patios in the summer but I will definitely not be returning to find out. In total my one drink and one meal cost me over $20.00"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Thursday night.  The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived but filled up throughout the night.  They have decently priced pitchers which was a plus but service was really slow.  We had a problem with our second pitcher-  we ordered mill street organic and my friends noticed that it tasted off.  But by the time we flagged down a server we were so annoyed we just asked and paid the bill.  We left more than half the pitcher of beer untouched.  We did mention that the beer tasted bad, to which the server feigned concern but then never came back to confirm that she actually checked it out.  I guess since we had already paid, they really didn't give a crap."}
{"text":"I honestly go every week and drag all my friends. Food is good, prices are low, and portions are great."}
{"text":"I came here to meet a couple of friends for drinks and dinner and this place definitely exceeded my expectations. Everything from the decor and atmosphere to the food and friendly service was amazing.  I ordered a drink called \"Fruit Bowl\" to start and it was a concoction of fruity deliciousness. It was the highlight of my meal!  Next came the avocado eggrolls. Avocado in eggrolls with a tangy sweet chili dipping sauce, need I say more? These were one of the best that I've had in Toronto.  For the main, I got the house burger. I liked that there were 2 patties and the bun was really good. The patties had a spicy kick that is unique to Templeton's.  I got to meet the owner of Templeton's and he was the nicest guy ever. He mentioned that they will be expanding and changing the menu over the next few weeks, hopefully they'll add a few desserts. If today was any indication of the quality of the restaurant, I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Ever want quick eats that's affordable and tasty? Templeton's is a local joint that's got a varied menu that could work for just about anyone passing by. I've been a frequent customer and have only had time now to review. The breakfast burger is awesome off a hangover, and their deep fried cheese appetizer is to DIE for!  Service is chill and casual, but if you can grab a spot on the patio during a pedestrian sunday, you've got the best seats to live music out on the streets while having a pint of Mill St. Organic to boot.  Their pad Thai has a nice kick to it, and is great if you're looking to warm yourself up. Will continue to come back here!"}
{"text":"Some of our friends helped my boyfriend move into a new apartment, so he decided to take everyone that helped out for dinner.  We decided to meet at our friends' apartment to find a place, and they live close to Kensington.  I looked up places, and this place stood out because it has a cocktail menu, beer and vegetarian/pescetarian options as well.  So we walked through Kensington, found it, and went it.  It wasn't crowded even on Saturday, although it started picking up as the night progressed.  The beer selection isn't spectacular, but it's still decent.  The cocktail menu looks super interesting (the Pimms and lemonade is really good), and you can get pitchers of cocktails as well.  The food menu is pretty standard, although they definitely have some interesting appetizers.  Our friends said the burgers were good, but the grilled eggplant sandwich and the chicken bacon avocado wrap were a good size and pretty delicious.  The best part?  The price.  I had two beers and a sandwich for under $20, not including tax and tip.  For Toronto, it's pretty great to find a place that has good food and drinks for a decent price.  I'd definitely go back, even if it's just for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Super disappointing experience. Came here on a sunny morning a few weeks ago with some friends, and was excited to see that the patio was open. That was pretty much the last good sentiment of the visit. Ordered a drink from a very brusque waitress, and it never came. When I asked her about it over 20 minutes later, she claimed that I'd never spoken to her at all. No apology. My friend ordered the waffles and it was very obvious they'd been pulled out of a freezer and maybe even microwaved? They looked like eggos. Cool whip and meager portion of fruit on top. My other friend ordered Eggs Benny, waited ages for them, had them arrive with the wrong meat on top, sent them back, and then waited so long for them to fix the issue that she ended up cancelling her order entirely. We were served by multiple different waitresses and I assumed the confusion was a result of them being busy and understaffed or something, but when I went inside to use the bathroom there was almost no one there. The staff was rude and dismissive about the whole situation. I didn't end up getting charged for my drink, but I'm pretty sure that was just an oversight, not an apology. I'm not usually a picky diner by any means, but this was memorably bad."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday on a beautiful spring day.  The streets were jammed with people and most every restaurant was packed.  Not having been in the Kensington area before, we walked around and checked Yelp out.  Definitely should have done some pre-investigating, tons of restaurants, every kind of cuisine under the sun! This place has a funky, young vibe and the outside patio was completely full.  The reason for 4 stars - no umbrellas or shade.  Maybe some people can sit and bake in the  hot sun while drinking, not for me.  Best of both worlds is sitting inside because the entire front of the restaurant has doors that open wide.   The menu is a little bit of everything and all 4 of us ordering different things.  Burger, veggies sandwich, wrap sandwich and taro spring rolls.   The pad Thai looked amazing and was a huge portion.  Very reasonable as well.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I recently visited Toronto and had one of the best meals at Templeton's! We sat on their patio and started with small plates: the lotus root, jalapeno stuffed brie, and candied walnuts. All were absolutely delicious! The jalapeno stuffed brie was lightly deep fried with a delicious raspberry coulis. The lotus root came with a chipotle mayo sauce. For my main meal, I had a chickpea mash sandwich which was also divine. My dinnermate had the paella which he said was very very good. I am so happy we stumbled upon this restaurant. Truly delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are familiar with Java House, or Nirvana, or Red Room, Templeton's is another in this genre of low cost, high value, good table service type restaurant. It's located across the street from Supermarket at the top of Augusta Ave. With a dark wood and well-stocked bar staring at you as you enter, this is a classic Toronto bar/ restaurant where you can plop down, order some drinks and peruse the menu all in one motion as effortlessly as grabbing a NOW magazine on a Thursday and checking out who's gracing the cover. My Viet style stew with chunks of beef and more than a hint of lemongrass really hit the spot as did the glorious caesar drink with the jumbo shrimp adorning the glass. This is a nice little spot just off the beaten path."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken Alfredo and it was all fresh and good stuff. Their butter squash soup was made good in terms of quality, but not my favourite taste. I'll keep trying more stuff here."}
{"text":"Ended the Yelp Elite Tasty Tour here to grab a drink.   It was pouring outside and the A/C was on full blast inside and the bay window wide open! They figured it out quickly enough though.   Very accommodating in terms of seating a large group. Not a huge venue so I wouldn't necessarily being a huge group, seems beys suited to small clusters.   Washrooms are easy to find and clean.   I didn't order any food (was planning on going out to dinner) and didn't get to order any drinks. The tour leader ordered some pitchers and I went to the bar to try to order some drinks and the bartender/server said she'd come grab my order later.   Later never came. :(   Didn't stick around long due to that and other plans. Templeton's didn't really leave a good impression on me (which is a shame because they've got some good specials) - I'd rather write them off and try some other place."}
{"text":"We came here after hearing about this place from a friend. The food here is reasonably priced. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, which had Chinese leafy greens with shrimp.  This was tasty. The dumplings were crunchy and overly oily.   My boyfriend ordered the spicy noodle soup (similar to a tom yum soup) with shrimp. This was pretty spicy with that sour flavouring to it. The noodles were cooked well too, not too soft. I ordered the Hot Kick burger. The burger overall was really dry, both the patty and the bread. It comes with a creamy dill sauce, which the burger really need. I liked that the dill sauce, wasn't overpowered by the dill. I really enjoyed the fries as they were the thicker kind, were golden and crispy. I think the burger could have a bit more of a kick, the jalapenos weren't really spicy.   I liked the atmosphere here and the drinks were reasonably priced too. The décor is unique, a lot of different wooden chairs of different styles, with Asian art and many mirrors on the wall. They also have patio seating.  For 2 mains, an appetizer, and 1 beer came to about $40 with tip and tax for 2 people. I'd be willing to try their other dishes, but I wouldn't order the burger again."}
{"text":"it was just... ok  we got a pitcher (14 bucks on thursdays) of mill street which was great. for food we got hot burgers and spanish paella. the beer was good, the sweet potato fries were yum, and the food were fairly cheap... that's it. the burger was served with what tasted like day-old bread that's thick as a brick.. kind of killed the whole burger cuz all we tasted was the bread. the paella was just not.. anything special. it tasted of chicken, rice, tomato, and a bit of salt - I had much better flavored paellas in the past, this was not super impressive.   maybe a good spot for drinks and fries. food you can skip."}
{"text":"I didn't come here because it was bookmarked or that I have ever even heard of it or noticed it on one of my many strolls through Kensington... Forgive me!  So my friend and I stopped in after have some delicious Summerlicious buttermilk fried chicken and burgers downtown. We were looking for a nice patio to enjoy some wine.  That is exactly what we got, the restaurant/bar had a nice comfy feel to it because of the mismatched dining chairs, the dark interior walls lined with mirrors and picnic benches on the patio. There were no frills to the menu, cutlery or glasses. I think my wine glass was even a bit dirty.   BUT... where else would you find gastro pub food next to pad thai, next to paella and so much more. The brie stuffed jalapeno looks mouth watering.   The wine we ordered came chilled and was a pretty good chardonnay for house wine. I kept getting distracted from my conversation by the food that was coming out of the kitchen... i think my friend just stopped talking at one point. Its like being given super delicious and creamy ice cream when you're lactose... i rarely regret buttermilk friend chicken.  So, next time I'll definitely be back for their cheap pitchers of cocktails and delicious looking menu!"}
{"text":"I came back just over a week ago and it's still a great place for inexpensive food (so many choices!), cute decor, and an interesting choice of beers. I tried a watermelon flavoured beer and it was so refreshing. I'll be coming back again! :)"}
{"text":"We ended off our Yelp Elite Tasty Tour here last night and it was A-Ok. Please note I did not try any food here.  The waitress seemed very friendly and pitchers were delivered to the table fairly quickly (thanks Evelyn and Yelp for the beverages!).   I really loved the decor and the feel of the restaurant, with the wide open windows at the front (which did have to be closed eventually due to a torrential downpour).  I will return to try the food and update my review then ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered a Peach Mojito Pitcher but got one with cucumbers in it instead... Whatever though, we rolled with it.   Comfort food at it's best, you get what you paid for, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Great spot for cheap food & drinks. Red sangria is delicious and full of fresh fruit. Menu has several vegetarian options which I love. Chairs on the patio are a little uncomfortable to sit on for a couple hours and service is a little slow."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we made the mistake of eating breakfast before coming here. Boy did we regret that. The food looked absolutely amazing. And the outdoor patio is awesome.  The drinks were fantastic. We were scouring for bloody marys only to find out that in Canada they're called Caesars...and they're delicious! We also got a (very necessary) pitcher of white sangria. Delish.  Wait staff are a bit feisty but very nice overall. I had a great time here!"}
{"text":"One of the best patios.  I've been here several times and each time is amazing. They have an awesome patio, awesome drink specials, and just an awesome brunch in general. I haven't been here for dinner but I will check this place out if I'm around!   Their Peach Mojito special is sooooo good and not too sweet. Their caesar isn't too shabby, but nothing too special.   I gotten the squash soup which was around $5 and LOVED it.   The decor is really cute on the patio as it over looks down Augusta. You can people watch all you want haha.The servers are friendly but not as helpful as I would like. but I'm still going to give them 5 stars because of the amazing daily drink specials and the patio.   DRINKSDRINKSDRINKS."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, it's such a cute/cosy looking restaurant with amazing prices. Inside can get extremely warm though during the summers so try to get an outdoor spot! This place reminds me of Java House and Red Room with the affordable meals/drinks but delicious food (most of their food is under $10). I would definitely recommend the paella, it is scrumptious! The pad thai is yummy too ($8 for decent amount). The reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4 stars is that the service kinda sucks. Extremely slow and the servers don't seem to understand me half the time."}
{"text":"I had the avocado sandwich. It was okay (not bad) but not super impressive. Like a perfectly average sandwich that you could probably make for yourself at home. The accompanying salad was alright.   My friend had the sweet potato fries which were alright (seemed like they came from frozen) and the spring rolls (which she had thought would be fresh but it turns out they were deep fried). The spring rolls very much tasted like the frozen kind you would get at the grocery store. Overall, it seems like they do average bar food.   In the future, I'd probably eat elsewhere and then just go to Templeton's for a drink to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. After walking in, we weren't sure if they had a kitchen, so we asked. They showed up the menu...and they have all sorts of food (!) : Spanish, Italian, Thai, etc.   What's also interesting is that they also give discounts to students, and on different days, they have discounts for different types of food. On the day I went last week, it was a discount on Asian food. Normally, when I see a menu with all sorts of food on it, and discounts, I turn and go to a different place. But we decided to give it a try.  We walked away pretty happy. All the different types of food were actually good. I had the fish and chips and it was good! I love it when the batter is cooked to a crisp but the fish on the inside and still soft and not overcooked! Yum...Alsas, it was way more than I could eat, though. But that's not really a complaint, because I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"I love Templetons - I was initially lured in by the patio, but I've returned so many times since.    They have an adorable little patio, with larger picnic tables for groups and two-people tables for smaller groups. Their drinks selection is very good and they have a daily drinks special every single day of the week - usually it's some sort of discount on their jugs. I've included a picture of their weekly specials menu.   Their mixed drinks are a bit hit and miss.   The peach mojito is definitely very good, but it's not really peachy, or much of a mojito either. It's made with vodka, so it doesn't really have that punchy rum flavour to it. It's also not very minty - I definitely like my drinks a little stronger in general. I don't think it's very alcoholic either; the last time we ordered a jug I think I only saw 2 or 3 shots get poured into the drink. This drink is definitely very light, almost watery, and you can definitely taste that it's mostly juice and club soda. However, it's pretty good for a starter drink, or if you just want something cool and refreshing on the patio.   For the sangrias, I definitely prefer the taste of the white wine sangria over the red. It comes with quite a bit of fruit but I'm pretty sure those are added in afterwards - I feel like this is more of a \"wine mixed with fruit juice\" kind of deal than a real sangria. If you order a jug of the red, they put orange juice in the bottom half so it's a very pretty ombre orange and red color. You're supposed to mix it before you drink. On the weekends they have freshly squeezed orange juice!  They have mimosas on the weekends made with freshly squeezed orange juice (but they run out of the orange juice pretty quickly). It's pretty good, and definitely very affordable - a liter carafe will run you about $21. Their brunch is pretty awesome too - they serve it every day until 4."}
{"text":"Actually, my favorite place in Toronto! Low prices, nice atmosphere, good service and polite staff! Nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came down to Kensington in hopes of finding good food for a student-friendly cost. We were originally going to go to Seven Lives, however we were instantly enticed by interesting décor and a fairly trendy & \"young\" crowd sitting outside. We were immediately seated on antique wood benches and the menu was pretty wide-ranging- I decided on a Greek salad with chicken and my friend got a grilled eggplant sandwich with a side of fries. My salad was amazing and I really appreciated the fact that they included the dressing on the side so I could manage how much I wanted to put on my salad, and my friend loved her sandwich.   However, the only reason I couldn't give this place a 5/5 is because of the wait. I understand that when we walked in there was a HUGE party of at least 8+ people which can be pretty overwhelming for a super small restaurant. The total wait time was about an hour and a half. At about the one hour mark one of the servers kindly asked us if we were \"okay\" and we had told him that our food had not come yet, telling us that they have 1 chef in the kitchen and that our food should be here shorty, which turned out to be another half hour. Unfortunate, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"With a boyfriend in Toronto, it's great that I get to explore the big city once and a while! This weekend was our first adventure to Kensington Market. We loved the lively feel and the brightly coloured shops.  We decided to check Yelp to see where would be a good place to go. Templeton's had some good reviews so we took a chance. We were unsure where to find it at first since there is no sign from what we could see. We checked the menu outside the door to make sure we had the right place. This place is so cozy inside. With their old world flair, velvet walls, and mismatched chairs, it has a ton of character.  The menu has a ton to offer with lots of different cuisines to try. At first I was going to go for the butternut squash soup since it was kind of a cool and blustery day but I opted in for the paella instead. My boyfriend got the bibimbap.   I would say this was probably the best paella I've had in a long time. Everything was cooked really nicely and the spices were just right. It was hot but not enough to make my lips hurt. Lots of meat in this one too which was good!  My boyfriend enjoyed his bibimbap a lot, his bowl was completely spotless when we were finished. The paella was a good helping so I got to bring some home for lunch the next day, score!   All and all, we will most likely be back soon since there was so much on the menu we wanted to try out!"}
{"text":"Another great Kensington spot!  The prices are fantastic, the portions are overwhelming and the food is surprisingly delicious. While there are lots of places in Toronto where you can get a huge meal, usually it's paired with a stomach adventure worth praying to the porcelain gods over. But this place is quite delicious and flavourful, and has a surprisingly large menu to choose from.  As the photos will demonstrate, the place has a wonderful blend of being kitschy and ostentatious in a fun way. I've never had a problem with finding seating and the service is not too bad . The servers are friendly but they're not very attentive and you will find that the tables are just a bit sticky.   It's a great evening spot to grab a cheap meal in a fun spot before heading out for drinks."}
{"text":"Great patio for people watching. My friends and I had a pitcher of the peach mojito which was very reasonably priced at $15 and huge. Didn't get a chance to try the food but saw the menu and everything looked good and very reasonably priced again. Would go back to try the food and more of the drinks. Service was a bit slow however for a Saturday night and it wasn't that busy. We weren't in a rush though."}
{"text":"Prices were good but I thought the food was pretty awful. I'm usually one to clean off my plate, but this time I couldn't even make myself finish half of it. Avoid the pad thai! My friend's waffle benny seems a bit better but she wasn't fond of the sauce either (although she did say her egg was poached perfectly). Servers were average, nothing special. Wasn't fond of the decor either."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the service is distasteful. Besides it being slow around 4pm , and 4 staff on the floor,  I waited about 15 minutes before receiving any recognition that I was sitting patiently waiting for a menu. I had a tasty burger with a watery bellini. After I finished my meal and made it pretty clear I was done by pushing my plate to the far end of my table, I waited 17 minutes (yes, I timed it) for it to be finally cleared away. I think the \"problem\" may have been that  I was dressed a bit  professional and was working on my computer over lunch , and that didn't jive with the slacker look & vibe the staff  was expecting everyone should conform to . Yes, I was in Toronto for business,  and I happily stumbled upon the interesting looking Templeton during some downtime exploring Kensington. I didn't know there was an implied dress code that I had to appear & behave  to be someone I am not in order to be competently served. Also, what is up with the music ? Hey, I love the XX and listening to explicit versions of Kanye beats as well, but is it really appropriate to be blaring it in the early afternoon at decibels best suited for a stadium? I literally couldn't hear myself think ,except to wonder if the other women in the restaurant felt uncomfortable with Kanye's most dirty mouthed, misogynist  tirades played at full  throttle , so every single \"b***h\" was discernible. I guess this is just the regular daily soundtrack  for the  four bros working there .  I smiled through being snickered at by the two bartenders as I paid my bill (the bros  looked pained that they actually had to be disturbed from their sarcastic banter for someone to hand them over money) and left them a 20% tip . Not because the service was good (it was awful)  , just to leave a little subtle reminder of how the dynamic works between server and guest.  I.E.  I am paying you to be there.   As a business owner myself who deals with operational issues such as cash flow and financing, I am very cognizant of this relationship and the importance of highly valuing my customers.  Interesting story : while meeting with banking partners earlier that day , I learned an applicable data point:  banks are very  adverse to lending to restaurants  in Toronto as the failure rates are so high.  I hope the owners of the Templeton keep this in mind and are aware the attitude of their staff are turning off the very people that could help them to avoid that fate.   Nice place the Templeton, but unfortunately I won't be back next time I am in T.O."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, tried the red sangria and the Fruitbowl. Great little plates too, will be back for the burger with brie!"}
{"text":"Sangria was great and the patio was nice, the nachos with jerk chicken was really yummy. BUT the service was really bad. We waited a reallllllly long time for our food to arrive and we only ordered a salad and an appetizer and it took at least 30 min to come. I don't think I would go back, just on account of the bad service. And when we asked if it would be coming soon, the waitress threw shade, was dismissive like \"huh,\" and acted like \"how dare we ask that\". She wasn't nice."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in Kensington. First the place is pretty beautiful. The music is cool like the people actually (normal it's Kensington !) the drinks (pitcher) are not so expensive and good. And concerning the food it's cheap and quite excellent. Not the best one but with friends and a cocktail pitcher that's perfect. And They have a large choice. I will miss this place."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely awful.  My husband and I arrived here at 1 pm on a Sunday. The place was about 3/4 full, but many people were already served when we got there. We ordered an eggplant pesto sandwich and a wrap. We waited patiently for 35 minutes, watching as other tables were served before us. We asked the waiter what was going on, he said it would be only a few more minutes. We waited another ten minutes, and again asked the waiter what was going on. He then admitted that the order had not gone in in the right order. At that point, we got up and left. .By the time we left, we'd waited close to 50 minutes for two sandwiches. We should have left long before that."}
{"text":"Ummm no idea why there are so many good reviews for this place. Checked it out last week for dinner because of these said reviews and was highly disappointed. My friend ordered the burger which was missing the cheese he asked for so when it came back it was cold and hard and tasteless, his onion rings were also cold. I ordered the fajitas wrap, which was nothing special, the sour cream that came with it was FROZEN and the salsa was a watery mess. We got a pitcher of Organic and not sure if the lines need to be cleaned but it did not taste like Organic nor any kind of beer. We couldn't even finish it! (and that is saying a lot for two people who never waste alcohol).   Only saving grace was the service was really good and the discount we received for having such an awful meal.   I don't recommend eating here.  NOTE: Templeton's (319 Augusta Ave) Inspected on: January 30, 2014 Inspection finding: Yellow (Conditional) Number of infractions: 3 (Significant: 4)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner at Templeton's! We had the chicken and avocado wrap, with a Japanese salad. Also LOVED the brie-stuffed jalapeño peppers! Great local beer and rap, and excellent unique cocktails. All with local culture and flair, and at great prices. The service was excellent. And the inside is very cozy, a bit romantic even. We'll come again next time we visit toronto!  I have to add: get the deep fried kit Kat bar sundae. You'll be happy you did!"}
