{"text":"When I plan to go out for a beverage with someone or my family; I prefer somewhere where you can hear each other in a conversation. So many pubs blast loud music or a game and you can't hear yourself think.
This is the first thing that I like about Henry's. The food is good too. Reasonably priced and good value - which makes this place a winner in itself. Service is excellent.Friendly and courteous staff. 
I go here often and thoroughly enjoy this pub."}
{"text":"This is an interesting little pub that's inside the Sheraton Hotel-Cavalier. It was quiet for a Friday nite. We were waited on buy a delightful young waitress called Jenn.

The food was good. The house salad was large & delicious, very nice. Had the \"Hanks Platter\" which was wings, onion rings,"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a bar person, but I really liked this place.  Minors are not allowed inside probably due to the slot machines, so my family and I ordered some take out food to bring back to our room.  The chef, waitress and the manager were all really nice, and they gave me suggestions on what to do during our stay in Calgary.  We ordered the poutine, cheese steak sandwich with fries, kettle chips with dip, and buffalo wings.  Everything was delicious, and we ended up eating almost all of it despite having already eaten dinner."}
{"text":"On a Tuesday for lunch when I was looking for mere sustenance I found a delightful waitress and a delicious steak for a fraction of what we had paid nearby the night before.  The cedar plank steak was outstanding and the price was great.  The waitress knew her customers, many regulars, and knew the menu well.  What a pleasant surprise for a hotel restaurant! I'm figuring out how to eat here again during my stay!"}
