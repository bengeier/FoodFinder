{"text":"Came here after the comedy show.  Ordered sushi and had the premium flight of  sake.  Both very good.  Good service also.  It was a sat night and it was very quiet too.  Outside patio was very nice looking,"}
{"text":"We dined here on a Saturday evening around 9:45. So it was past that crazy dinner rush.    We had a reservation and they weren't quite ready for us- there were many dirty tables.. So I'll assume they just needed to catch up.   Once we were seated they provide a complimentary wasabi hummus dip type item. It was tasty.   We couldn't decide what we wanted for wine and they kindly let us sample a couple types. That was a plus for me - so we ordered a bottle.   We skipped appetizers but ordered three sushi rolls to share. You MUST get the Miami maki roll!!! I could've eaten three. So delicious. The sushi was some of the best I've had in Charlotte and I've been to about 6 or so sushi places.   The decor is funky and modern. I honestly didn't think I was going to like this place. I'm so happy that I was wrong. We had top notch service. Our waiter was super friendly without being fake. The food spoke for itself and the decor is cool.   We had the groupon but the prices weren't unreasonable and I'll definitely have to get back there soon!"}
{"text":"Finally another great sushi place in Charlotte!  I am always hesitant about sushi restaurants, they are either really good, or really, really bad. Eight has a funky laid back vibe and feels very welcoming. Some of the great artwork by local artists, ahem..Matt Hooker & Matt Moore, gives this place a vibrant feel.  I was a bit disappointed they don't serve hot sake, but was quickly turned on to the cold sake served in shot glass inside a box which fills with the pour over from the glass. The server told me the overflow was a representation of of happiness and good luck. Quite charming I might say.   The food was on point, we ordered several rolls and one beef skewer. I was impressed with everything we had. They have a lot to choose from and it was hard to make a decision. The Godzilla Wrath roll was probably one of my favorites, it's super spicy (in a good way) so if you're not a fan of the heat, I'd steer clear.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning to try some more items."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant. Decor and atmosphere was impressive. Albacore Tataki appetizer was excellent. They also had Mango Boba Cocktail which was good. Yaki Udon was on point. Tried the Eight Roll, Miami Roll, Firecracker Roll, Sashimi Roll, and Sea to Shore Roll. All were tasty. Did I mention they also make their own sriracha?! Eight is Great!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out yesterday evening while waiting to see Margaret Cho @ CZ. I ordered sushi and a drink. The sushi was great! But the staff was less than friendly. The gentleman that took my order appeared to be the manager and was working behind the bar. He was a complete jerk, no personality and not at all friendly. It seem as if he did not want to be bothered with customers. The place was empty maybe 8 people at the most and I was the only one @ the bar. So the attitude of the staff was not appropriate. I will have to be desperate if I decide to try this place again."}
{"text":"The cocktails were awesome,  the food was hit or miss.  Their tempura tastes like standard American fried, so the tempura mori tasted like really good state fair food. I didn't get any real sushi unfortunately."}
{"text":"The staff at Eight was fantastic. Had dinner here before a show at the amphitheatre, and recently started a very restrictive diet. The staff didn't blink an eye with all of my crazy requests. Not only was that great, but everything we had was mighty tasty. I will be back for sure. And it's a great food spot before a show."}
{"text":"Sashimi okay but service, main entrees, and rolls were no good.   Seek sushi elsewhere.....if there is something else in Charlotte??"}
{"text":"Went for some sushi with some friends ,waited for an hour and a half ,then finally 2 orders came out for a party of eight .worst service I have ever had .the staff acted like they just didnt care ."}
{"text":"In my 3 years in Charlotte, I have been on a hunt for my sushi spot. This my friends is it. Not every roll is fried, it let's the fish shine, and they focus on quality. We had the toughest time deciding what rolls to get and was not disappointed at any point. From the speciality rolls to the classic rolls, everything was just fantastic."}
{"text":"DEAD SUSHI. Don't know what's wrong. The place has really cool decoration and atmosphere. However we showed up at 6:45 and left at 9:30 on a Wednesday night and we honestly were the only people inside. Sushi took a while to Come out for a group of 7 and my friends Asian chicken meal didn't come out until about 10-15 mins after our sushi rolls came out.   Average sushi. Just average. If this place had more people, and some music it would be popping. I tried a lot of sushi and appetisers and nothing really stuck out.   Tonight special was $7 Sangria."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, the rolls we had were really different and delicious! The Eight roll and the Sea and Shore were my favorites. My girlfriend loved the Godzilla'a Revenge roll. The waiter was responsive, funny and honest. We would definitely go back before a concert or a comedy show."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences and services that I've had in Charlotte!! Mediocre food, out of everything and was lied to about being served mochi ice cream....that told us twice it was fried ice cream and it clearly stated it was mochi after I asked them time. They told us they would take some things off of our check and then proceeded to increase the price I our drinks to offset the cost difference. I called them out on it and showed them the menu to prove it then they added food items back when they fixed the drink prices!"}
{"text":"I ate at Eight!  Cool decor, great sushi, and a good location if your headed to the music factory.  All that, and its not extremely pricey.  As others had mentioned, the service was a little spotty.  There were only a couple people in the place and most of the staff was kind of sitting around looking bored.  I think there was some confusion on who was supposed to seat us as well.  After that though, we were promptly seated.  We were a little slow to order as most of the specialty rolls were a little different than any place around here.  It was free so, no harm done, but our waiter wasn't timely on bringing the edamame hummus and shrimp chips that other tables received as soon as they were seated.  As per the food, I'll elaborate below.  Most of the specialty rolls had a well thought out theme to them.  The Hamachi shiso maki had yellowtail, shaved serrano peppers for heat, a little cucumber for crunch, and a shiso pesto on top.  All that with a little avocado to bring it together.  Very light flavors, but well balanced.  The poke roll was awesome, but it seemed more like a play on poke.  It did have some chunks of tuna on top and I'm not complaining about the fact.  It also had some macadamia nuts and avocado, which is relevant.  The cherry tomatoes were a great addition as well.  But, I didn't see any green onion, nor did I even taste a hint of seasame oil or soy sauce.  Then the big ole' tempura shrimp threw me way off.  The flavor of poke that I am used to just wasn't there.  All that said, it really was one of the best things I had and honestly, it would be easy to overpower the dish with sesame oil, so no harm done.  We ordered other things as well, the green papaya and mango salad.  I like mine a little more made for gringo's.  I thought the fish sauce was overpowering and I really didn't get much mango flavor either.  We tried the QC roll too.  Good, but in no way the highlight of the evening.  All in all though it was a pretty good meal.  On a downside I will mention that our waiter wasn't the most pleasant and personable person I've ever met.  I wouldn't be happy working with a place that is pretty much empty this close to the holidays either though.  The demeanor was nothing close to what some people have said in some of the bad reviews though.  I did go without water for a little while, but he was pretty attentive in general.  Bottom line is, I liked the food and I'll be back.  However, I just don't know that Charlotte's downtown or all the foodies on the south side will really travel to this area for dinner unless they have other plans at the music factory as well."}
{"text":"Been here before and it's awesome.  Last night's experience was a letdown.  The guy who seated us was also our server.  We made it clear that we had a concert next door starting up in an hour.  The place only had four tables yet our food took forever.   We went with the Restaurant Week menu.    We finally got our sushi rolls and went ten plus minutes without any plates.  Had to ask for everything that the server should have anticipated.  The Pad Thai showed up after we had eaten everything else we ordered about 40 minutes later.  Had to go so we never even got to try it.  Forget seeing any of the desert items we selected.   Great food ( what we got) but a total letdown on the service."}
{"text":"We were in town for a weekend away and decided to stop here to have dinner since it was so close to The Comedy Zone. I'm so glad we did! Everything was amazing!! We had the sake sampler flight for $8, and although we didn't care for the raspberry flavor, the others were excellent. We also tried the chicken yakitori, Korean fried chicken, chicken fried rice, Godzilla sushi roll, and a few new seasonal cocktails. We loved every one of them. The flavors in the Korean fried chicken were just mouth watering good! The spicy tuna on top of the Godzilla roll was actually a larger portion than other sushi restaurants we've gone to. It was too much fish for my husband, but I really enjoyed it. Our server, Monica, was attentive, friendly, and made excellent recommendations. If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely be stopping by."}
{"text":"Went here last night and to be fair, it was SO COLD outside that I shouldn't have been surprised that we were one of two tables. That can make it a little uncomfortable for the server with over attentiveness, but she was great. My friend and I got the lobster Rangoon appetizer, which was really good. I got the godzilla roll based on a review that it was spicy.  Good variety on the rolls and it seemed fresh. Hard to judge a restaurant when there are only 4 customers, but I enjoyed it. I love the NCMF because you have pre and post dinner options to walk to. Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing that blew me away so much that I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi lover or eater for that matter, so I appreciated the bento box options offered here.   Service was excellent and I greatly appreciate the assistance with my large party without a reservation. Granted it was in the middle of the day during the week but the host and waitress went out of their way to setup tables and get us a delicious meal fast.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place and I'm glad we did because we have always wanted to try this place. The service was fast and efficient and friendly! The sushi was delicious! Try the QC Roll!"}
{"text":"Wish I could review the food. They never brought my dish to me. They told me that the chef \"missed it\". I had reservations at the Comedy Zone, so I couldn't wait another hour for them to bring me anything. I guess I could ask the other people at my table how they enjoyed their food. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Really cute place decore-wise but it seems like that mostly what your paying for. Came here for a celebratory lunch with the fiancé. We got bento boxes #5 and #6. He for soup and I got salad with our boxes... Both of which were really good. As for the actual rolls, nigiri and sashimi ... All were pretty average. The fish wasn't the greatest quality and we found ourselves using a lot of extra soy, wasabi and spicy mayo.  We had a groupon ($18 for $30) and tbh I probably wouldn't go there without one and even then it still seems steep when considering quality vs price."}
{"text":"Eight probably has some of the best interior design I've seen in Charlotte. Unfortunately, their food quality and service fall to the other side of the spectrum. The Ramen noodles were served in a custom kitchen broth that tasted more like a bad gravy. The Korean beef skewers were mediocre, cold, and I couldn't help but think of the old lady on the old Wendy's commercial - (\"Where's the beef!\")The summer rolls were pretty good. The best thing I had was probably the papaya salad, but there simply wasn't enough of it. A friend of mine at the table gave me two of his dumplings because he knew I was still very hungry after all of my appetizer samples. The dumplings were ok. I didn't get my drink until after my food starting coming out and had to ask for a refill. Overall, the experience was so poor that I'm not sure I would be willing to go back, and spend my money on small portions of food. The lack of quality, plate size, and overpriced food were just too many disappointing factors to allow me to give this place another chance. To make matters worse, my friend seated across from me, waited an hour and a half to never receive his food. He literally left the restaurant without one bite of food. I think it's safe to say that the manager knew full well that several of us at the table had a bad restaurant experience. I'm really surprised he didn't make an effort to smooth things over for PR purposes by visiting our table and offering an apology. I wish this restaurant the best of luck but like so many things at the nc music factory over the years, this restaurant might go the way of the dodo..."}
{"text":"We visited Eight Sushi last night for a long overdue use of a Groupon I bought awhile ago.  We had a 7pm reservation, and it was very quiet in there.  Parking was not close, but we walked and it wasn't too bad.  Since it was a Saturday night, I'm assuming there was a concert or event nearby.  The actual restaurant is beautiful!  Service was on point all night with our server, Mike.  He was super attentive and you could tell he was a genuine nice guy.  Dinner began with a complementary edamame hummus appetizer.  Different, but we liked it!  We then moved to a first course of sushi.  Both of our rolls tasted super fresh!  I really enjoyed mine- it was a shrimp roll- and the shrimp was hot and just cooked.  It was a great balance with the fresh rice.  My husband also got miso soup with his volcano roll, which he really liked.  Main courses was a Udon beef stir fry (me) and Chicken pad Thai for my husband.  My dish was delicious and flavorful but make sure you like sauce because it has a lot.  His was very good, and close to the traditional pad Thai we'd had at Thai restaurants before.  Both portion sizes were good.  There's a large cocktail menu but we didn't sample any...and a few desserts too.  We'd come back!"}
{"text":"Okay, when I first entered Eight Sushi, I had the sudden urge to start Breakdancing (and/or Electric Bugaloo). It's a good thing Tonya was there to stop me. The decor is unique, modern, crazy awesome. Murals, grafitti, mosaic bar tops but well integrated and not \"in your face\". Decor= 5 stars. Ice cold Jam Session, edamame hummus with shrimp chips=5 stars. Friendly waitress with a rock star smile = 4 stars. Spicy Tuna Roll - good but not great=3.5 stars. Mix it all together and you get a chill place for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place is not prepared for a decent weekend crowd. Food is taking FOREVER and the staff are in a disarray to say the least.  This place is on my \"STEER CLEAR\" on the weekend list. Although the food is good....it's not THAT good."}
{"text":"We love this spot.  The ambience and art work are way cool - check out the bar made of skateboard pieces!  Colorful and unique.   The food is awesome and the saki selection is fun.  We really like the Fuji Apple saki and the passion our favorite server has pouring it!  The sushi is high quality with great flavor.  We always go for an assortment of sashimi and rolls and have never been disappointed.  Their tuna is nicely colored, meaty, and so good!"}
{"text":"Took my turn at visiting this new place just last weekend and was impressed.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly regarding the menu options as well as being attentive but not overly so as to annoy.  I chose a couple non rice/low carb options and while I've tried these types of rolls at other places, Eight really got it right.    This is the old Bask place but they have really transformed it via some very unique artwork by a local artist and given it a very trendy vibe."}
{"text":"We arrived about 1 hour ahead of our scheduled concert time for the uptown amphitheater right next to the restaurant. We told the host when we were seated that we were in a bit of a hurry to make a concert on time at 8pm and he said, \"you're in luck, we had a reservation just cancel.\" We ordered drinks and sushi. After about 45 minutes of waiting for our food, we told our server we were on a time crunch and had to go since we hadn't yet received our food or the second round of drinks we had ordered approximately 10 minutes earlier. We paid way too much for 4 drinks (2 rounds) that weren't great and no food, and although they comped the sushi we ordered since we didn't eat it, no manager came to our table to check in with us or apologize for the long wait. I was disappointed in our overall experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly slow on a Friday night, but we're happy to use the groupon and check it out. From the first step in the door the service has been phenomenal. The GM and our waiter have both been fantastic. We started with some pork dumplings...they were heavy on the ginger but that's what we like. Delicious. Our 4 rolls were pretty tasty as well, and surprisingly the crispy double tuna was my favorite...I usually don't like cooked rolls. We see no reason not to come here again and I'm pretty shocked it's this slow on a Friday with this level of service and quality food."}
{"text":"I really like this spot, it's a nice addition to the music factory area. I have only tried the Miami Maki Roll... why ... it combines two of my favorite things Mango and Avocado! I have been with friends and they have tried different rolls as well as other appetizers. I also tend to get an appetizer of Edadmame as well . The last time I went we sat at the bar and my friends  tried their white sangria while I had a bubble tea. Now the bubble tea was a bit pricy ($12) but you did get a large glass and I sipped on it my entire meal. Overall this would be a great date spot with free parking.. once you are done eating you can hit up a bar or catch a comedy show!"}
{"text":"We visited Eight on a Saturday night.  This was the restaurant we decided to eat at prior to our comedy show.  As we entered the door, the greeting was not warm and hospitable.  In a slightly arrogant way, we were greeted with \"do you have a reservation!\".  My reply was \"no do we need one?\" And this gentleman, if I just call him that, ignored my question.  Well you know what, it was on and crackin' from there.   I then told my wife, we would give them one chance and if it didn't work with our appetizer, we would immediately walk out.   I ordered a salad and beef kabob.  Luckily for them, the presentation on the plate was attractive.  The salad was fresh.  And the kabob was tasty.  My wife ordered fried rice.  Her fried rice initially tasted fairly yummy.  However, after finishing the dish, it did not sit well in her stomach.  It may have been the type of oil used to make the dish.    Would I visit this place again?  Probably not, but I would consider visiting other establishments near this one.  The surrounding restaurants looked inviting from the outside and definitely had more customers.  I think the local people knew something we did not."}
{"text":"It's Date Night Kids!!   My fiance and I came here for dinner---We're serious Sushi Lovers. I've been wanting to come here for a while.   We made reservations around 8:45pm through Open Table. Arriving to the Music Factory there was a Horrible storm! High Winds and lots of rain. The restaurant was quite, maybe ten people dining. We choose a high-top table, our waiter (Harry) was Great! Talk about great Service!!   I LOVE the decor!! Everything from the light fixtures to the large murals behind the bar....someone is VERY talented! The Food here is amazing! Reasonably priced, and Filling. My Fiance is allergic to shellfish (Bummer I know) He ordered the Eel & Avocado, Philly Deluxe Roll, and Spicy Tuna Roll---Love in every Bite!!! Lucky Me, I eat everything!! So this Fat Kid ordered the Shrimp Double Crunch, Two Tuna Firecraker, and the Alaskan Roll.....DELISH.   OH FYI Be sure to Pay attention to the bottom of your Receipt! There's a  printed message saying \" Use this receipt for 2 free tickets to a non--celebrity show at the Comedy Zone.\" Ummm Yes please!! I'm calling the number below tomorrow!!! Gotta love free stuff! Another Date night Coming Soon!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Sushi was unappealing. One of my friends actually refused to eat hers because the crab tasted off.  Go to Ru Sans instead."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and really cool design.  Sushi...OK"}
{"text":"To sum up the review - I don't hate Eight.  We decided to try a new sushi place before going out in the NC music factory and we were underwhelmed at the experience.   First, the waitstaff tried to seat the four of us at a table reserved for a party of six, which created a moment of awkwardness. We were re-seated at a rather uncomfortable and shaky high-top table and were able to quickly order our drinks. My cocktail was delicious and strong and they had a decent beer selection, but they probably could have gotten more drinks out of us if the wait staff came around a bit more. Our waiter was MIA for most of the meal and they brought the order for the couple we were with an uncomfortable amount of time before they brought ours. Additionally the table was pretty small even though it was two couples splitting two plates with drinks so it wasn't like we were trying to fit a lot of food on the table.   We started with the calamari which wasn't too greasy and had two yummy options for dipping sauce. I ordered the Godzilla's wrath roll, which I was ultimately disappointed with. I like spicy tuna, but this roll had far too strong of a jalapeno taste and if I had known it came with diny diced jalapeno I probably would have ordered something else. My boyfriend ordered the sea to shore roll which was average, and we split a spicy tuna roll.   Overall the meal was okay, the service was okay and the drinks were good. We would return if we wanted sushi in the NC music factory but wouldn't go out of our way to come here again."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick take out dinner. I got the chicken fried rice and was really happy with it. I know that a lot of people say that it's hard to screw up fried rice but trust me, I've been to far too many places that have. Eight Sushi's fried rice was perfectly seasoned with soy sauce and with a small addition of Shirachi it was as spicy as I like it. When I have more time for a proper meal i want to stop by here again and try some of their other dishes but i definitely am planning on getting the fried rice again."}
{"text":"Ok I wanted to really like this place because the food is really good but Im giving it two stars because after the third time being there- I've heard the same complaint. The service and the kitchen is slow. Several times I have been on the patio and just flat out ignored or left to wander inside for a drink at which time I have to interrupt staff on their cell phones to order. If you go expect amazing food but less than par service"}
{"text":"This is such a great addition to the NC Music Factory. I think this area and surrounding businesses will benefit from having a solid sushi option here.  I stopped here before CFG Style Week to grab dinner with some girlfriends. I love what they have done to inside of the place. Big upgrade from Bask. I would describe it as a trendy and chic decor. Some really cool work by a local artist.  In celebration of its grand opening, Eight has been running sushi special buy one signature roll and get a classic roll free. Check the restrictions... valid Tuesday-Thursday for a limited time only.   We each ordered two rolls. We went with the Hilo Poke Roll, Spider Roll, Hamachi Ponzu Maki, Krazy Roll, Panko Tuna Roll and the Alaska. That food didn't stand a chance. It was all good. I really liked the combination of the Hamachi Ponzu Maki. Spicy Yellowtail and Cucumber Roll, wrapped with Yellowtail and Avocado, Shaved Serrano, Cilantro & Shisa Pesto. I don't think I've ever had a roll with pesto. Hilo Poke was also great.  I also ordered one of the boozy bubble teas. It's like an interactive milkshake for a big kid. Oh, but with some alcohol.   There is free parking available in the lot across from the Fillmore. If you don't feel like walking, there's also usually valet right inside the fountain area. I think it's just $5. I always go for the free and the exercise... well, unless it's raining or my shoes are too big.  I will definitely be back. I love that the Music Factory has another choice for food when it comes to pre-gaming for a concert, comedy show, event, etc. Good luck to you Eight Sushi!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte and  have been searching for good Asian cuisine, after sever attempts at other places I finally found Eight Sushi & Asian Kitchen and I was pleasantly surprised. This place reminded me of home (NJ/NY), literally in every way possible, the decor was awesome (a large mural painted on the wall, nice light fixtures and nice functional furniture).   The food was delicious, I had the Spider Roll (soft shell crab), while my wife had the Panko Salmon Roll. The Sushi was fresh and held up pretty good while eating with little to no fall out or breaking apart. We also shared the Yuki Udon which is the sliced beef short ribs with noodles and veggies.  The veggies were nice and crunchy and the meat was nice and tender although it was well done.   Overall I give this place five stars because it embodied what I was looking for coming from the Northeast or New York where sushi restaurants of quality are abundant. I would definitely recommend this place and plan on returning."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because if anyone has read any of my reviews I love sushi and seafood in general so a new Sushi spot is something I always welcome...  That being said I cant give my personal thumbs up to Eight.  We decided to try this place out last Friday at my urging because the reviews I saw were pretty good. We arrived at about 8pm and though there were people the place wasn't very crowded at all.  As other reviewers have stated the décor in the inside is quite nice.  We asked if we could sit at the bar since no one was at the entire bar and the tables they had free were very low for my tall companion.    We sat a the bar and waited for 10 minutes before we asked could we put our order in.  Did I mention NO ONE was at the bar.  We put in a simple order bottle of Sake, order of  egg rolls to share, 2 orders of miso soup, and 2 orders of dancing eel roll.  Waiter poured and spilled some of the Sake.  20mins later our eggrolls came out... bland and not that tasty though they were hot. Another 15 mins went by and we had to ask about our soup.  10 minutes later One bowl of soup arrived??  When we inquired about the second bowl of soup we got an apology from the waiter that he was confused.  When we placed our order I ordered my soup and roll first.  When the waiter went to my partner he said \"I want the same thing, soup and the same roll\"....so not sure how that could be confused... But hey no harm no foul.  The Second bowl of soup comes out 15 minutes later.  No tofu, no seaweed, just  2 slivers of mushroom and water??  We sent that bowl of soup back. Another 15 minutes go by with no roll.  We ask again and are told its coming.. 5 minutes later ONE roll arrives.  The waiter never corrected his mistake.  After a lot of apologizing...we just asked for the check.  The roll was gross, chewy, small, with ONE piece of eel on the entire roll.  By that time too much time had passed to find another sit down restaurant-mainly because my partner had to work in the AM and it was much too late. He was forced to eat a turkey sandwich when we got home so he wouldn't starve .  The one star I give is to the manager on duty that night.  He was apologetic and over all very nice..however we will not return for a do over."}
{"text":"And the desperate search for fresh sushi continues - this place is not the one.   I give it three stars to indicate there is room to grow.  When I came here early on a Friday evening, we were greeted warmly by a cute hostess and even better, edamame hummus with shrimp chips. Started off with a bang.   The sushi itself was underwhelming. The only way to describe it would be that it had no integrity as if it was frozen and unthawed rather quickly. It's a shame given how good their decor. The concept works and the staff seems solid.  Great location with some upside.   *** Mini-Update (10/29/14):  The chick handling their marketing/social media reached out to me and explained that their fish is never frozen.  Maybe it was just that particular tuna catch.  Anyways, it's always cool to hear back from businesses, and I'm looking forward to giving this place another shot in the near future.***  dmo out."}
{"text":"Loved it!  We went on a Wed night for my bachelorette party/dinner and the food was amazing!   The appetizers were so delicious, we ordered tempura and beef.   The sushi was super fresh, which is how I like it!   The atmosphere was incredible and fun.  It is close distance to other bars in case you want to grab a quick drink afterwards.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had gotten a travel zoo voucher to try this place out.  It was a nice night so we sat outside, so I having nothing really to say about the decor. We started with the Korean Beef Skewers and wanted to try the vegetable dumplings, but they were out of them (we were not the only table disappointed by this). I would actually not recommend the skewers.  There are only two of them with two bites of meat.  Mine was all gristle, while my husband's was ok.  I actually left one piece behind I could not eat it at all.  For the price there are better things on the menu.   We then moved on to sushi.  We tried the rainbow roll, which was just ok.  We have had better.  So we decided to move on to the Nigiri, which was the star of the night.  We loved all the nigiri we got, like six different kinds I believe. We rounded everything out with the Bao Bun with Pulled Char Siu Pork.  The bun was perfect, the meat was a little salty but oh so plentiful. We would recommend highly just be careful if you are salt sensitive like I am (I gave my husband most of the meat and just ate the bun).    Since we were celebrating our anniversary the restaurant gave us a wonderful free dessert.  Nothing we have ever had before, cake, ice cream in the center, fried. They said it was the special occasion dessert that is not on the menu. That really made the evening special and was a very nice touch.  All in all we had a good nice, nothing special, nothing great, but a good night out."}
{"text":"You know how some places just don't quite hit the spot?  It isn't that anything was horrid..its just that nothing was over the top....that describes my time at Eight.  I'm not a fan of warm sushi.  Everyone seems to love New Zealand Café as well but the two times I went, the sushi was lukewarm.  Something about that just wigs me out.  Anyway, the same applies to 8.  The sushi was warm and yet not a fried (or tempura) type roll.    I also found the specialty rolls to be expensive and small.  I think I only got 6 pieces which is just not fun.    We weren't super excited about a couple of the appetizers either but the pork dumplings were very good!  The springrolls were less than exciting.   The atmosphere was OK but it was EMPTY on a Saturday night...which concerns me.  The service was decent.  I don't know...I just found it to be sub-par.  Not worth any special trips out there and I honestly don't think I would go back even if I was in the area."}
