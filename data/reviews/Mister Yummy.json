{"text":"If you want the best Korean BBQ in Toronto you need to come here. It's definitely not the ritz, but I come here for the food, it's amazing. Pretty reasonably priced and the staff are great. It's family run and has been around for at least 20 years! I make sure I come here every time I'm in TO. I live in Edmonton and can't find anything like it there, so I've been craving it for 6 months! Nothing like jones-ing for something you have to travel 3500 kms for! Lol Bottom line, you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"I had the beef ramyun and I was so pleasantly surprised!! it was packed with so many amazing flavors. I can't wait to go back. While I was there I noticed many repeat customers. The man who served me was so welcoming and kind."}
{"text":"Cheap Korean restaurant with tons of menu options and genuine, well cooked Korean food. Some of the menu items were not available when I ordered, but it didn't really bother me because there's so many options for you to choose from.   You can order the food zero spicy which is a big plus for me. Really enjoyed my Bibimbap, many amazing flavours going on and it was a very generous portion. I was surprised! This is a hidden gem.  The place is not the fanciest, location inside the mall is a bit meh - I feel a place like this would rock it if it was in a better location.   Pd. No credit cards accepted, only cash and debit."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food at low price! The stir-fry beef is a must for newcomers. The place is not fancy but what matters is the taste which I find that most will be surprised."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is the best. The owner (I think?) was very fast and friendly. I ordered the veggie kimchi fried rice to go and with tax it came to exactly $9. They also package a couple tofu and bean sprouts on the side... both of which are delicious and complete the rice dish. The portion size is generous and you're likely to have leftovers.  I will definitely come back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Mister yummy is yummy! So many options to choose from... the wall is covered in pictures of the food so you can order with your eyes:) I got the noodle dumpling soup & chicken fried rice with a fried egg on top. $20 for both. Not super cheap but it lasted me 3 meals so good value overall."}
{"text":"They have pretty good barbecued dishes, and I really love their japchae. Stews are just okay tho. I would really recommend getting things less spicy because their default spice level is probably considered extra-spicy at most Korean restaurants, and the spiciness could overpower all other tastes that the food doesn't even taste good anymore."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and the food is good, however I was craving some spring rolls. So I placed an order... I show up and give him an older 5$ bill. He tells me that ge doesnt accept that. I will not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"How is there only one review of this neighbourhood saviour?!  I live about two blocks north of Dundas West station on a stretch of Dundas where there's not much going on culinarily speaking.  When I'm lazy, lacking time, or just really hungry, I stop by Mister Yummy for some tasty takeout, or occasionally dine in.  The place is family-run, by a mother and son (from what I can tell anyway).  It's always cooked fresh to order and full of flavour with generous portions.  As a vegan, it's nice that there are a few options on their menu that work for me.  There is a small seating area, with self-serve water station and endearingly kitchy decor.  This spot is authentic and tasty, don't let the dated strip-mall location deceive you!"}
{"text":"Went here at 7:45pm on a Friday night -actually scratch that -I travelled out of my way to come especially here for their food, only to be told: \"sorry -no barbecue left\".  There's not really much else to say about that.  A Korean BBQ spot.  A Korean BBQ spot that doesn't have any Korean BBQ.  Words fail me beyond that. I'll never go back here, which is a shame because they clearly need the customers. Well, it won't be me.   (Also, from past experience I know that they add a surcharge for debit card users -isn't that against the Interac terms and conditions?)"}
{"text":"Cheap Korean fare that would do better in a bloor/dundas west storefront location rather than this failing mall, the place itself has generous seating, and friendly staff in a place that's really showing its age which brings this place down. The larger seating area is barricaded with after hours mall bars which makes it feel like some kind of prison commissary  The menu is plastered all over the wall, though half of the items are usually sold out. The food however makes the cut and Mr Yummy should be celebrated for doing so well with whats available. Great soups, bibimap, fried foods and kimchi which are all great points to any meal."}
{"text":"Had the Mister Yummy special which was an assortment of bbq meats and tempura.  After tax it was around $25.  Meat was deliciously flavoured but overly salty and a bit dry.  It's a self serve establishment with quite a bit of seating.  Great hidden gem for fast Korean food in this area. Would try the non bbq food next time as it'll probably give a better sense of the food."}
{"text":"I was more than a bit skeptical when I was told about this hidden gem in dodgy Crossways Mall. Dog-eared, home-printer quality photos of menu items lined the walls alongside dated kitsch decor and a music video screen shot shrine of Psy won me over almost at first sight though.   At the late lunch hour of 1pm, a large number and variety of groups occupied the self-seating area. The cross section of diners who all looked like regulars included Korean teenagers, a mother with small children, and a few older single men. We witnessed quite a few take out orders as well.   It took a while for the food to come out, so we were pretty sure it was all made to order. The portions are humongous and the food on par with that of Koreatown. Our fried dumpling order was filled with beef and vermicelli and came with a chunky and flavourful hot sauce. Our choices for the \"Pick 2\" BBQ plate were galbi (beef ribs) and chicken. We were ecstatic that we could sub in chapchae for rice and banchan at no extra cost.  A surprisingly large pop selection and self-serve water cooler provided excellent refreshments for the incredibly hot food."}
{"text":"Whether or not the gentleman taking your order is THE Mister Yummy himself, there's no doubt about where the name came from. Mr. and Mrs. Yummy in the back crank out delicious Korean dishes well enough to make you feel like one of the family.  They have a special; a stirfry, more or less, of vegetables and your choice of protein with rice for under $7 (lunch) or $8 (dinner). You really can't go wrong with the price when you compare it to everything else in the area. The vegetables are fresh and tender and the meat provides that perfect punch of savouriness.  I've also had their Galbi and Japchae (Korean short ribs and glass noodles), and while they're a bit on the pricier side (about $11), you really get to dive into more of what Korean food has to offer.  One thing you'll definitely remember from here is Mister Yummy's signature quote, \"Spicy/No Spicy?\". They really hit the spice levels for me. You can feel a little burn as you indulge in the food, but there's definitely no lack of flavour whatsoever. To give you a better idea of my spice tolerance, I can take down the Korean 'Buldak Bokkeumyeon' without much pain.  Forgive the decor. You'll really appreciate the food that's dished out here."}
