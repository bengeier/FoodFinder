{"text":"We lover server Janine she is awesome !!! She makes feel we are at home!! Food is excellent too !!!"}
{"text":"I dine here quite often, it's pretty good and fresh, however I wish they had more of a unique variety and less rolls with cream cheese. I also don't like their special sauce, it's sweet, I prefer spicy mayo that most sushi restaurants use. Service is always good, I have not had a bad experience so far."}
{"text":"nice restaurant, all you can eat but it is not a buffet so you have to order.  Foods are good however, the rolls are very big.  only 3 pieces will make you full already.  you can't enjoy much if they make too big."}
{"text":"Went to Blue Fin for AYCE lunch. Really enjoyed the rolls. Fish was fresh and the menu had plenty of rolls to choose from. The Poki salad was pretty good as well as the special roll of the day called a C-4."}
{"text":"Needed to find a new sushi spot and this place happens to be nearby. Glad it is because I was completely satisfied with the overall visit and have been back several times since the first. Fresh, clean flavors. They don't serve Blue Fin Tuna though, at least that's what they told me. Courteous and attentive staff. Lots of dining space to accommodate any size party. My kids enjoyed it also and they'll adjust the menu to take care of finicky tastes buds. Prices are fairly standard sushi prices and they have AYCE, which is all I'll do. It's all or nothing for me! Open late, clean environment, great location. Overall great GV sushi spot."}
{"text":"best sushi place in vegas!
they serve the freshes fishes and the slices of their nigiri's are normal not like those places with small cuts...
they serve fresh wasabi which ive yet to see at other sushi places.
this place is amazing good food, the chef ynot and owner gene are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the past two weeks. That should tell you something ;)
Upon entering you receive a warm welcome from the staff. The service has been great every time I have been here and the food is AMAZING!!! They have a great selection and the \"All You Can Eat\" is a great deal. I have tried different items at each visit but I have to say the Firecracker Roll and Royal Mexican Rolls are my favorite. If you are looking for great Sushi, great service and a welcoming atmosphere...this is the place to be! Lunch Specials are also a great price."}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi chefs are all very nice and attentive. Kyle is probably my favorite sushi chef because he's very creative with rolls and will you make you different items based on what you like. It's also very clean, and everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"I have seen this place many times and I decided to finally visit. After moving here from California I have still yet to find a place as good as some out in cali.

I came here for the AYCE, my first impression was the decor is nice and open not cramped and dark. After getting ignored by the host I finally was able to put my name down. When she called our name she went to seat us... at the bar... I don't mind sitting at the bar sometimes but this time I was on a date and wanted a table normally they ask if you want a table or if the bar is ok however she did not ask me just started sitting me at the bar, I politely asked if we could have a table instead I don't mind waiting a little longer to have a table and she obliged and got me a table within minutes. After sitting us down at the table I had no other interaction with anyone after about 15 minutes I asked a bus boy (you could not tell who were the bus boys or the waiters) if we could get some drinks and he said he will get us some he came back promptly with our drinks and took our first order or sushi for us. We received our first 2 rolls fast and they were delicious but this is where it got even worse.

After we finished our rolls we picked our next, and waited, waited some more, since we didn't have an actual waiter visit our table I had no idea who was a waiter or a bus boy or who our waiter was or anything. After 30 minutes of people walking by over and over and waved one down and asked if I could order some food he said \"of course has no one taken your order?\" I said no, everyone just walks by and looks at our empty table. He took our order and the chef then bought us our food, well some of our food we didn't receive everything we ordered. After another 30 minutes I waved down the same person and said can I order some more. He gave me another surprised look that no one had taken our order again. Long story short it took 2 hours from being seated to get just a couple rolls. I gave up in the end, I left hungry I did not want to wait any longer for half of what I ordered. It is the most unorganized place I have ever visited. It seemed like no one knew what they were doing, no one had sections to serve everyone was just all over the place. 

Would never come back here, would never recommend it to anyone. They need some major leadership skills."}
{"text":"Incredible service, delicious food and amazing value.  The Sushi was fresh and plentiful!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been enjoying the Blue Fin for several years now.  The creative group of Sushi Chefs seems to have expanded, and surprisingly, the quality has remained at the consistently high level we have come to expect.  As the economy picks up, so does the number of people that dine there, but that is not a bad thing.  Since we sat at the Sushi Bar, the service was spot-on.  Miso soup is some of the best in the valley, and the sushi is always fresh.  Try the Rock N Roll roll......."}
{"text":"The food was horrible and overpriced. I took my daughter, 4 yr old and 2 yr old grand daughters and they wanted to charge me 14.99 for them to eat. I would not recommend this place. The next day I was really sick not sure if I got food poisoning. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, the owners are very nice and the food is always great. I would recommend everyone should dine here."}
{"text":"Japanese staff was super friendly, decor was very japanese as well.  They have an option option for all sushi rolls you can eat within an hour, with good selections to please the american palate.  But since I was craving tuna sashimi, I ordered that plus a spicy tuna roll and they were just perfect!  Plus they gave me free hot tea and free orange (beautifully sliced)."}
{"text":"Another sushi place. The quality of the fish was ok. Had the poke salad and the tuna they used wasn't all that great. Might have to give it another try maybe.."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It's good, not the best, but  it's good enough to satisfy your sushi craving. Today I came in for lunch AYCE sushi with my niece who is 10. She got charged the adult price of $21.99. I feel like that is too much. I mean for kids under 7 it's $14.99 and I feel like that's a fairer price for her. I even asked about it before I started ordering but the server didn't respond to me and in the end charged me full. Unfortunately because of that, I probably wouldn't come back here. Sushi places are a dime a dozen and this one isn't that special, it was convenient that's it."}
{"text":"I love coming here for all you can eat. Everything is fresh and delicious. The service is friendly but not overbearing. I love ordering half roles so I can try many things, and I love that more exotic items are included on the AYCE menu. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"For me, this place was just A-OK.  I came on a Saturday for lunch, by myself and sat at the bar.  I was pumped and ready for AYCE sushi.  For me, \"sushi\" means rolls - I just don't have much interest in the other foods.  For my starter roll I always like to order a spicy tuna - as a judge for my comparison to other places.  To their credit, the Spicy Tuna roll was the largest roll I have ever seen.  I later learned (though it is not listed on the menu) that I could order half-rolls.  Honestly, one roll in and I was starting to feel full - ARGH!  It was a good roll.  

Next, I picked one of their fried roll specials - the Mexican roll.  Now this was new to me.  I've never had a fried roll.  Honestly, it just wasn't very good to me.  I should have stuck to what I know best and not deviated too far.  The roll was larger than the first one and each piece was too large to eat by itself.  Bummer.  I couldn't finish the roll - it was just too much. 

So my AYCE excitement was crashed when I could only finish one roll and a half.  I didn't get to try anything more.  Call me lame for sticking to rolls at a place like this, but it's what I prefer.  

I will add that the place just felt weird to me.  There were about 6 men working behind the counter and the kitchen - and only 3 customers.  Several of the men came out to \"catch a glimpse\" of another female customer eating by herself.  Kinda creepy.  

I wanted to really like this place, but my experience just didn't do that for me."}
{"text":"Really Great Sushi, and Service is Excellent. 

I read the reviews, and im suprised I have never had a bad experience here. 

I have two favorite local sushi places and this is one of them. 

The fish is fresh and the deserts are great."}
{"text":"It was my 1st time at Blue Fin. Service and food are AMAZING!!!  We're differently coming back for more!  Great job team  (='.'=)"}
{"text":"We tried blue fin for lunch one day and we loved everything there the food was great super fresh and fast service . The rolls are giant. So yummy ..."}
{"text":"First time here. Super fresh fish and fantastic service!  I had the all you can eat even though I came in for sashimi. I did not regret it. I gave the chef free reign to make what ever he wanted and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Was quite pricey but great food. The smell of fish was a bit overwhelming though. My kids were commenting on the smell making the nauseous- maybe it was a bad night"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE restaurants. The nigiri is by far the best in town,cut to perfection and not over-riced also the staff and especially the chefs are really friendly. p.s. they serve there sodas in cans and not from a fountain, uses BiteSquad and has decent appetizers menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We got the AYCE and the first 2 rolls were outstanding. The catepillar and tempura spicy tuna roll were just what I was looking for. It went downhill quickly from there. Every subsequent roll was just plain bad. Maybe I'm just not used to Vegas-style sushi (what is up with all of the wacky/sweet sauces--you're supposed to be able to taste the fish, people!), but I just couldn't deal with the weird combinations. The sweet/fruity/mayonaisey sauces that were on all of the other rolls were just disgusting. They overpowered the flavor of everything, so that all you tasted was the sauce. I eat sushi for the fish, not mayonaise. The cajun albacore? I can't imagine a japanese/sushi restaurant outside of vegas selling that as sushi. It was waaay too strong and there was not that all-important fresh fish flavor that you want from sushi. Everyone working there was super-nice and efficient, I just don't think I'm part of their target demographic. If you like sushi with tons of overpowering wacky sauces, come to this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi is so fresh!  Love the choices of the AYCE.  Glad we tried this place and happy to say we've found a new Sushi spot."}
{"text":"Now that Blue Fin offers ALL YOU CAN EAT! I definitely advise that you arrive early.  The Rolls are Great. However, during the time I visited, they had 1 waitress. So because of my All You Can Eat experience, I knew to  order 3 or 4 rolls in the beginning to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"Did the all you can eat and loved every bite! I had the chefs surprise me with their favorites and they were very fun and made excellent rolls! There are no menu item restrictions which includes appetizers and dessert--unheard of in other restaurants. All the servers were prompt when taking away dishes and refilling drinks. Overall great place, food, and staff!"}
{"text":"Finally a sushi place that is affordable, and amazing! Had the spicy spider roll, and golden tiger...so delicious"}
{"text":"I love to come here and I am never disappointed. Atmosphere, service, food (delicious) and ambiance are cozy and friendly. I always count down the days for my visit. Thank you blue fin :) I will miss you. Until next time."}
{"text":"We have been there twice. The wait is long and they do not acknowledge the waiting customers. However, that being said, the food quality is excellent. We have visited several ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI restaurants and this is one of the better ones. We tried several different dishes without disappointments. We will go back and hope they work to improve their customer service; other than that we have no complaints. Definitely a recommendation."}
{"text":"They use too much mayo and sauce on everything.   The rolls are huge, too big to fit in mouth.  The tempura tasted weird like cornstarch.  I don't like eating at AYCE places and you get full off of one huge ass roll.  The sides such as the udon and the salmon skin salad should be smaller as well.  

The udon broth and the nigiri was good.  Had the yellowtail and white tuna.   

Overall It was ok, dont think I will be back though."}
{"text":"Tried this place as it was recommended by a friend. My normal is sushi Mon so the bar is set high. Blue fin was ok. I enjoyed the cajun albacore as it was very \"cajun\" flavor. Other than that, it was just a normal sushi place. The ice cream sucked, red bean and green tea was freezer burned and tasted gross."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! We moved to this side 3 years ago and found this little sushi bar right next door. We have never gone anywhere else since. No where else compares to this!!!!  Great quality fish, awesome selection of rolls, amazing appetizers!!!  We love all of the chefs and they treat us great!!!  We never even have to order.  They already know what we want!!  Well worth your money. Try them out."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, really fast. For some reason the few times I did go it wasn't even crowded. I've been to a whole lot of sushi places, and this one is at the top. You get in and get out. Very quick and delicious. I was hesitant to write a comment because I really like it that it's not over crowded. You get to have a one on one with the chef & the sushi comes flying out, where most places you have to wait like 5-7 min because all the chefs are serving other people. When I go in I like to be served, and that's exactly what I get there, with really great food. Update 10/30/16 I just ate here last week & I noticed that the fish tasted different, so I mentioned it to the chef. He smiled & looked at me & said that this last batch of fish came from Chile because of the price for fish in the US was high. I said that the last time I ate the salmon, it just melted in my mouth. Because of the inconsistency I removed one star. In my opinion I think Sushimon is a little better, but the service is great!"}
{"text":"go here a lot with my co-workers and family. good food, reasonable price for AYCE. the staff is friendly and attentive. it's a small place and does get bust around lunch and dinner.

i always leave there ready to burst."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is my favorite sushi place east of the 15 freeway.  I'd like to thank Lisa R. for introducing me to this place, as it is awesome, and very delicious.  It's a smallish sushi bar, and the bar itself only seats about 8 people I think, maybe 10 at a squeeze.  The quality of the fish is top notch, and Chef Jin can make up some crazy combinations for you to try if you let him.  What I really liked is that the pieces of Nigiri style sushi weren't overly large like some places, and he for sure did not over rice on anything, which at an AYCE place is a wonder.  Chef Jin also made this delicious shizo leaf pizza, which was dairy free but totally excellent.  Overall I was extremely happy with this meal and will undoubtedly go back for sushi whenever I find myself craving it and am on the east side."}
{"text":"I loved it, food was great and service was awesome! They were like literally like at attention the whole time and my glass of lemonade was never empty."}
{"text":"The Ayce is the pinnacle of this place the the fish is good the chefs are friendly and the prices aren't horrible either ,deffinitly  a must if your feeling fishy and don't want to spare quality for price."}
{"text":"Nigri was very fresh...  But I agree with other reviewers that the rolls are way over sauced."}
{"text":"Average AYCE sushi place. It's a pretty decent place to dine with friends but the overall food quality ain't good yet ain't that bad either (can't give below average rating for those little appetizers and desserts, can I?) Service was okay except they constantly forget our orders (did you really forget over and over and over?) and we had to flag them down many times to remind them over and over again. Still, they get three stars because it's A-OK despite the fact I don't think this place (like many other AYCE sushi places) is run by real Japanese people."}
{"text":"More like a fusion style sushi.
The dishes look good but used over sauce, covered with other flavor than sushi itself..

Like another Yelper wrote, the quality of fish itself was not great."}
{"text":"Another gem that was close to work. I think what makes this my favorite is because the food is phenomenal, size is great, list of sushi also has seasonal treats, it does get busy but we wait. We see kids there, parties and the bar area is always happy. My advice? Go here and stay away from casinos or resorts that say they have all you can eat and the list is short. This place is a great date place."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to try lunch here after a gal at CVS told me about it. It's close to where she lives. The staff are very friendly and attentive. My mother had the Sweet Heart roll which she was very happy with. I went for the all you can eat and boy did I eat! I started with the Red Dragon Roll...very good and whatever is in their special house sauce is a perfect combination.  Then I went for their Veggie Royal (?), it's cooked in a tempura batter and has cucumber, avacado, carrots, beets, cream cheese with a eel sauce. OMG, this was the best veggie roll I have ever had and I have tried so many! That roll alone will have me coming back often. I then had Spivey garlic tuna, yellowtail and halibut. We both enjoyed the vanilla tempura ice cream dessert. Yum, large portion that neither of us thought we could possibly finish...but we savored every last bite. Go and enjoy. You will be very glad you did"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this half stars because I would give 4 1/2. I got the royal veggie and a cucumber which were both fantastic! Ordering, I thought the royal veggie was a bit pricey ($7.50) but it was a  HUGE roll so I get it now (cucumber was $4). First thing I noticed walking in is that it smelled good and not like rotting fish. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome deal for all you can eat sushi and amazing prices on wine!! Selection is ok and flavor is the same. If you're looking for best value though this is the place to be. Customer service is on point as we'll except for when it came to getting the check it was a little slow."}
{"text":"very special... 
the food, the people, the place
fresh fish is very important for sushi and this place have it...
an incredible and extensive menu is supported by the amazing chef's
they also have very good selection of Japanese sake and beer."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for over a year now. Sometimes once a week. Generally it's for lunch but sometimes for dinner. I have never had any sushi here that was less then fresh. 

The service is very attentive and the place is small enough that even when it's busy the service doesn't suffer all that much. The owners are nearly always there cooking and watching over things.

For lunch you can't beat the two roll special for under $9. It comes with choice of two rolls from a list of 14, soup and a wonderful mixed green salad with yummy Japanese dressing. The boxes are around $7 and a lot of food for the money. My wife gets the teriyaki chicken box. There is soup, salad, mac-salad, Cali-roll, rice and plenty of chicken. 

For dinner I get the sushi platter that comes with 7 pieces of sushi, yellowtail, salmon, albacore, Eel, whitefish, choice of cali-roll or spicy tuna, soup and salad all for $13.95.My favorite rolls are the spicy yellowtail and Bluefin special roll. I have only had the all you can eat once about a year ago and it was good too.

The edamame is sometimes a lil over done and the mac-salad often has a bit too much black pepper for us. All in all the value, quality, service and experience are very consistent. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi bar ---  fresh fish, clean flavors, generous portions!

Going to any restaurant in their first month since being open, I always get a little worriesome because there's so many kinks to work out. However, hearing from many friends and coworkers that the sushi was absolutely great, I had to make the trip out. The dining room isn't terribly large - maybe seats about 30 inside but there's a large outdoor \"patio\" which I could see myself sitting during the cooler months in vegas. However, the sushi bar itself seats about 12 and when I arrived for lunch, being open for only a few weeks, I was surprised but happy to see half the sushi bar was already taken up and few tables dispersed throughout.

 Looking over the menu, prices weren't bad at all with good lunch roll specials. Their hot foods menu was very limited but the roll list more than makes up for it. The chef recommended their \"Blue Fin Roll' and it was to die for! We tried a couple other rolls as well as some sushi and their tuna poke salad (yum!).  All the fish was extremely fresh and well cut. Most importantly, the flavors were so clean and well balanced. Something I appreciated the most. Service was ok - it was our waitress's first day of work - so nothing I'd hold them against. The sushi chefs were extremely friendly and quick.

Now here's the thing... in a land of \"all-u-can-eat\" sushi bar town, they don't do it. But it probably ended up being cheaper than an all-u-can-eat because their rolls are so big that i even had to cancel a couple more I wanted to try knowing there was no way my bf and i could finish them (and we're big eaters to begin with!) and the quality of the fish greatly surpassed most sushi restaurants in town. 

If you appreciated great fish and flavors I highly recommend this place! If you're looking to just fill up and don't care what it tastes like, I'd say you're better off sticking with any all-u-can eat in town."}
{"text":"Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Another great ayce sushi joint..

Nigiri is fresh and rolls are so good.  Great service - it's a small place so I can imagine it'd be busy on a weekend night.  We went on a weekday so there were only a couple other tables.

Also, get the dessert with strawberries and ice-cream!!"}
{"text":"With so many AYCE sushi places in Vegas, the wife introduced me to Blue Fin Sushi, and I think our sushi cravings have found a new home in Vegas.   The fish was of better quality in comparison with other AYCE places.  The pieces fish were chilled (not warm, like in some places we went to) and exquisitely sliced in large portions (some places do a hack job!).  I think the wife and I are purists because we tend to focus on nigiri, instead of the rolls.  This is the main reason why I will come back...the sushi rice.  The sushi rice is amazing here. It has been seasoned so well.  The texture of the short grain rice flavored with the slight hint of sushi vinegar is absolutely perfect for me.  For example, when I take a bite of the super white tuna nigiri, I first taste that slight hum of rice vinegar from the rice on my tongue.  My tastebuds then witness the sweetness and slight creamy flavor of the fish as it slowly intermingles and compliments the vinegar flavor from the rice as I chew.  The wife and I also request that certain sauces should not be poured on the nigiri, such as amaebi.  I just want to taste the rice and the fish, and chew slowly so i enjoy every bit of it. yummm.  The other stand out item to order here is the soft-shell crab appetizer.  This is probably one of the best places that this is prepared.  They use a panko coating/batter and deep fry the think.  It's like eating pork tonkatsu, except instead with a crunchy and crispy crust covering a moist and  tender soft-shell crab.  Definitely, we will be frequenting this place more often.  Plus, I still need to go back to try some Okinawan beer."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very yummy! Highly recommend it. Do the all you can eat. You get a lot of food and choices from the menu. 

There are two locations apparently relatively close to each other but they both are good!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for great sushi spots. The only complaint I had was that they sat us in a tight group with 4 other tables when there was plenty of space all throughout the whole place. Fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"I love going with friends and family here for the all you can eat. The sushi is very high quality."}
{"text":"They had amazing service and great food! The sushi was absolutely amazing. Our server was so nice and was there constantly to help us. High recommend this sushi bar!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the BEST AYCE sushi spot in Vegas! 

My boyfriend and i normally get sushi every other week and we usually try to find different spots. I found out about Blue Fin about 2 months ago and OH MY GOOODNESSS! IT IS FREAKING AMAAAZING! This is our favorite spot to go to. The rolls are superb ; always fresh and prepared super fast, and the sauces are very unique. 

The customer service is excellent as wellt! Everyone there makes you feel welcome and the chefs are really nice too.

 It's very spacious and quiet. And yes, they do have TV's, you can ask the chefs if you can change the channel and they wouldn't mind at all. Everyone here, is always nice and they really make you feel welcome.  

If you're hesitant about trying Blue Fin out, don't! Just try it out and you won't regret it :) Don't let the outside fool you either, it doesn't look appealing from the outside, but trust me, it is thebomb.com :P

Ohh, and make sure to try the Gangnam Style & Golden Tiger; YUMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.. We did the all you can eat special after we each ordered 2 rolls they never came back to ask if we wanted more. We paid $21 each for all you can eat but only got 2 rolls that was only $17 each.  Sushi is mediocre at best. Will not go back. Highly disapointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried many sushi places here in Vegas and we finally found the one we love!!! Blue fin has been the best sushi place because of their amazing service, we always get our refills quickly without asking, the staff is really nice and helpful as well as welcoming.The nigiri is by far the best we've have ever had, it is so fresh and portioned out great. The many rolls they have are very flavorful and fresh.Each roll has its own unique flavor and it's amazing.The appetizers are so good especially the gyoza, baked mussels and baked scallops.And the desert is to die for, the tempura icecream is the best ever.I strongly recommend this place to anyone, my husband and I love it and are there at least 2-3 times a month and every time had been stunning."}
{"text":"I am quickly becoming a regular at Blue Fin. The fish is always fresh, the service fast and the restaurant clean. 

My favorite thing about this restaurant is their Happy Hour. It's from 5-11, 7 nights a week. The only problem is, you have to make sure and ask for the happy hour menu. For some reason, it's not something they readily hand out. The happy hour menu isn't the full menu, but they still have some good deal to compliment their specialty rolls. The crunch roll from the happy hour menu is one of the best I've had!

I highly recommend Blue Fin to anyone looking for fresh sushi, good prices and a nice environment!"}
{"text":"I am not a big sushi fan but my boyfriend absolutely loves this place. I love that you can get all you can eat at a reasonable price  and it includes appetizers and desserts. The quality seems good and service is fast...."}
{"text":"I've driving been driving by this location about a thousand times debating whether to give it a try. Last week I decided to take the plunge. It's much much smaller inside than it looks from the outside. Don't bring kids!  I tried the AYCE which was $26.95. They wanted to charge me $26.95 for my 2year old which doesn't know how to eat sushi and won't allow outside food. 

The food was ok,  Nothing special. The rice was dry and the flavor of the rolls were weird. I definitely won't be coming back due to the service and charging full price for kids that can't and won't be eating."}
{"text":"I just ordered a sashimi combo to go and it was probably one of the freshest sashimi I have ever had in Las Vegas. Blue Fin Sushi is now on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! The rolls are not loaded down with rice so the rice to fish ratio is perfect. The fish is super fresh, the servers are amazing, and the chefs are super nice. One chef made sure I liked everything and even made me a special roll that's wasn't on the menu. My favorite roll was the Blue Fin Special- it was to die for!!!!! I can't believe how much I love this place. If you are a fan of baked green mussels, they have a very unique approach to the dish while keeping it simple. Also, they allow half rolls of everything except deep fried rolls so that's great especially if you want to try everything. I will definitely be back to this place. I'm already counting down the days....."}
{"text":"Second favorite local sushi bar. Always delicious. AYCE is typical pricing. A little higher than Sushi Bay. More seating. Larger seating area than before. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The food was fresh the service was on point! The price for the AYCE was only $21.99 during lunch and it was worth every penny of it and then some. Enjoyed great food with great company! I will definitely be going there in the very near future thank you for the experience!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Went because there were 4.5 stars.  Never again.  Ordered the all you can eat.  Our first roll the Spider roll, understanding it is soft crab shell and it tends to be a bit hard to chew.  It was so hard when I bit into it, it hurt my teeth and I could not chew it, as it was so hard.  next roll was a cucumber roll, simple, but again, the seaweed was chewy and i could not bite through it with my teeth.  Can not remember what the 4th 1/2 roll was, because it was not any better.  So, with all you can eat, it means just that.  I ordered another roll (twice I asked for it) yet it never came.  Nor did my Miso soup, edamame, after asking for a 3rd time; we were done.  Asked for our bill and told them NOT to charge us for the all you can eat- duh- but was charged additional for a 1/2 roll, apparently cutting a roll in half creates work that must be charged for.  Overall, bad experience, bad food and will never go back."}
{"text":"Out of all sushi places here in Las Vegas this is by far the best AYCE sushi. **HANDS DOWN** my family and I have been eating here for almost 8 years not only they have the best sushi they also have the best customer service here. I would recommend anyone to eat here. You won't be disappointed. TRUST ME!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. We ate here on a recent trip to LV due to a recommendation from a local. This was the worst sushi I've ever had in my life. There was so much rice it was absurd. It was packed on so thick, not a single piece was bite sized. Everything comes out drowned in sauce and includes crab salad. I don't understand any of the good reviews people are leaving, makes me sad for them that they think what is being served here is good sushi. I've had better sushi from the grocery store. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I loved all the food, but the service was a little slow and not too attentive but it was still an overall great experience. I'll definitely be coming back again. 

My favorite thing eating was the R.M Spicy Roll, yum! And the tempura ice cream wasn't anything too special. I wouldn't recommend the green tea flavor of ice cream. It had a weird florally taste. 

I'll definitely still be coming back (:"}
{"text":"Always looking for the best sushi place in town with a good balance between quality and price. I mean sure you can to social house and drop a $ 100 or more per person, but is the food 5 times better than blue fin? I think not, quality of fish, presentation, the personal service can't be beat. Tell them what you want and they'll make it happen. They took my salmon, tuna, avocado, and yum yum hand roll to new levels. After all the places blue fin is still top. Give'em a try, hope this review helps."}
{"text":"Let me just begin with the service: It was amaaaaaaazing and sooooo engaging. NOT. It was lackluster at best. Everyone from the busser to the waitress to the sushi chef rarely smiled and did not engage us unless it was necessary. And by necessary this means coming back every 30 seconds to ask if I was ready to order (as I was clearly still reading the extensive menu). None of them wanted to be there. I don't know if something had happened there earlier, but everyone had a somber face. I actually missed work while I was at lunch because everyone at my office is happy! We had empty glasses of water and dishes sitting at our table for about 15 minutes before they realized they should probably come over and provide whatever service they provide. 

Blue Fin Special( In: Cajun Albacore, Cucumber / Out: Tuna, Salmon, yellowtail, shrimp and avocado with Chef special sauce) --- I am SOOO glad I only ordered a half roll because this was just not edible. It was the mushiest thing I've ever had the displeasure of eating.. loaded with sauces that mask the natural flavor of the fish.. I only had one piece out of the 4 because I wasn't about to force myself to eat this despite the all you can eat policy where they charge you menu price for anything you don't finish. 

Johnny Johnny Roll (In: Mild Spicy Soft Shell Crab / Out: Spicy Tuna, Avocado with Yum Yum and Spicy Ponzu Sauce) --- This wasn't as saucy/mushy as the Blue fin roll, but it was equally as terrible. I ate two out of the four pieces.. There was just nothing special about these \"special rolls.\" The fish didn't taste fresh and the sauce was just overpowering. 

Spicy salmon hand roll & salmon skin hand rolls: These were good. They're very basic rolls though, so they're hard to mess up. I actually had these before anything else, so I was very excited to what was to come.. only to be disappointed!

Baked green mussels --- this is served in an escargot dish.. They really skimp on the mussels.. instead of getting a whole mussel per spot, they cut them in half.. so you're eating a tiny bite that might as well be considered nonexistent considering the amount of cheese they cover this dish with. You seriously might as well ask for melted cheese, because this is what it was. I was highly disappointed by this dish, as baked green mussels are one of my all time favorite things!

Scallops --- omg. this was fried to shit. It almost tasted like they reused oil to fry this.. couldn't even taste the scallops! 

Chicken katsu curry --- this was fairly tasteless.. the chicken was bland and overdone. This solely served the purpose of getting rid of my hunger -- It was uneventful and forgetful. Boooooring.

I was more than happy to pay the a la carte price for all the sushi I did not finish because it was so sub-par. However, they were gracious enough to not financially or digestively punish me in this situation. They simply removed it and hopefully gave it a proper burial.

HOWEVER, the highlight in this discovery is that this would be a great restaurant to take your companion if you wanted to break up. It's private, everyone's in a bad mood already, and the parking is close."}
{"text":"Bar far my favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Love the ambiance and the food is amazing. It's located on Sunset one block maybe two west of Green Valley. We of course had the AYCE and may have overdone it cause it was so delish. We all left with our stomachs hurting cause we ate so much but not a shocker I often get too excited when going out for sushi.

The Yum Yum roll was my favorite! The mussels are good but do not come in a shell they are served  on a fancy dish.

They recently expanded to double its size so that should tell you something."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical about trying new sushi places because of bad experiences in the past but I am so glad that I chose to try out Bluefin. I was greeted the moment I walked in, I was seated, I ordered and received my sushi very quickly. The sushi chefs were extremely nice and the sushi was delicious. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great value! 

The all you can eat is everything on the menu, not just rolls. 

The sushi was above average quality on both taste and presentation. 

The service was timely, and the staff was friendly. 

Next trip to Vegas, this place is on my list of places to eat again for sure."}
{"text":"Eat here only if you want to be rushed and hurried through your meal. The second you sit down and they are on you wanting to know what you want to drink and what rolls you want. The glasses they brought over for our beers were dirty on top of that. The rolls were laced with tons of sauce, overstuffed with imitation crab, and the one that was the worst was the spicy tuna roll, that was dripping with oil. They kept bringing over the WRONG rolls too?! We asked for the check and the waiter told us we have to eat more of our last roll first.....which was our plan anyway, we just wanted the check to get out of there, we didn't need to be reminded to eat our food like we were five years old. This place should be called SUSHI GONE WRONG, and I am mad at myself for spending my money there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have been in a long time. I paid for the all you can eat and OMG was amazing to try everything. It was different then most sushi place were paying for a normal small roll which here I receive more then needed. 

I shall be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Never have I been to an All You Can Eat Sushi spot where everything is made fresh to order! The rolls were creative and good, the ahi poke salad was delicious, and the jalapeño creations were tasty. The service was good and that always makes your meal taste a whole lot better. They have screens if you're wanting to watch a game which is a plus."}
{"text":"Favorite AYCE sushi! We always sit at the sushi bar and the chefs really take care of us. The price of AYCE is about the same as almost every other AYCE sushi place in town. Appetizers and dessert is included in the price which is always a plus."}
{"text":"We ate couple of nights and it was bad... reaaallly bad.

What happened? It was so bad we left early. Even the nigiris are bad. We only had 2 special rolls but it was bad as well.

Fish was old, rice was old. 

We wont come back, quality of food bad. With the price for the AYCE should be great food"}
{"text":"I love them! All their rolls are extremely fresh and tasty. I order from them often and have never had any complaints. They're all delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Blue Fin Sushi last night.....  We decided to go alacart.  I ordered a Tuna Poke salad.  When I got it I noticed it had way to much jalapeño in it so I quietly picked it out as I choked down the ridiculously spicy seaweed and tuna concoction.  By the time I finished the small bowl I had removed almost a full jalapeno!  (I was starving or I would have complained).  My lady ordered a mixed fish roll that clearly didn't have what it supposed to on the inside ($13 roll) but she was also starving so nothing was said.  We were both still hungry so we ordered a Kari roll (pretty sure I spelled it right)  on the menu it said it had soft shell crab in the center (and only soft shell crab)  We got the roll and dug in.  First bite I noticed it tasted like mayo (overwhelmingly ... also a $13 roll) and I looked at it.... sure as shit it was full of crab stick!  We ate the fish off the top and left the rest.  Our waiter came by and saw this and asked if everything was okay....  I proceeded to tell her the roll didn't match the description on the menu.  She then spouted off and said \"we always mix in crab stick in all our soft shell crab.\"  Which i replied that it should say that on the menu like it does with all the other rolls.  I told her I didn't enjoy my poke salad either because it was overwhelmingly hot.  She kept looking at my lady like I was crazy then brought us our check....  no manager came to apologize or anything... $45 later we left upset and discouraged.  There are too many delicious sushi places in Vegas to waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Always Awesome!
The place: small, quiet, clean, 
The staff: friendly, efficient, quick
The food: delicious ficious!

More about the simple nigiri sushi and basic rolls - but done really well.
There are fancy, American-style rolls and treats here as well. 
They have no problem with requests and special orders.

My fave in this part of town."}
{"text":"This is a good AYCE place but their roll selection isn't that versatile. Don't get me wrong, it's very yummy, but I like seeing creative combinations!

What I really appreciate about them: 
-You can do 1/2 orders of some rolls, just ask
-Dessert is included in AYCE - NO LIMIT ON MOCHI, weeee!
-Good for groups
-They have TVs, which my husband appreciates when a big game is on!

It's definitely a good neighborhood place to go to when we're looking for good AYCE."}
{"text":"Great place for the price! Never crowded! Great rolls! Give it a try"}
{"text":"yes!!! Finally a delicious sushi place. O....M....G!!! Not only was it delicious but our server Omar was very helpful and made very good suggestion. Everything we tried was just perfect. I will BE BACK!!! Can't wait!!! Highly recommend you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. In about 10 visits I haven't found a single thing to complain about. The service is great, chefs friendly, and the food tastes amazing. Highly recommend Blue Fin if you are looking for sushi."}
{"text":"This place is the best. For real. Fish is always so fresh, their rolls are inventive and the staff is super warm and friendly. Definitely a go-to for sushi - never disappoints!"}
{"text":"There's an AYCE option for like $24/$28 depending on lunch or dinner. The regular menu prices if you don't want to stuff your face with AYCE sushi is pretty reasonable. It's like $8 a plate! The quality of the food is really good. The screaming orgasm appetizer was amazing, though I admit I just ordered it for the name. You should try it!

The employees are kind, they don't linger too much which I like. It's a small place but very cozy. It's a little way out of the strip, but eating in those expensive sushi restaurants there before, the quality of the sushi is pretty much the same (arguably better). 

Definitely will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I am in awe of the service here. 5 stars allllll the way around here! The food was fresh, delicious,and fast! I am really over the moon about this place! The fish was super fresh and everything was just so tasty! The calamari wasn't your ordinary calamari, it was cut up pieces of steak! Sooo delicious!  Ok back to the service. The service was AMAZING!  Took the time out explain, suggest and even altered a roll because of the cream cheese. Such a great place to dine with friends or as a date night. Not too loud actually perfect! Come and enjoy super fresh sushi at an ultimate gem of an ayce!"}
{"text":"First time was great. Second time with my wife and daughter not so good. I ordered the blue fin lasagna. We order a bunch of other food and it all came in, to include mochi dessert. They kept telling me it (blue fin lasagna) should be almost done or that it would be 15 minutes to bake. After about 30-40 minutes later, they said it was burned and asked if we wanted something else (as if to say they were sorry). We wanted to get the tempura ice cream anyway. So we ordered it. Final bill came in and they charged the tempura ice cream. Other restaurants would likely have done that at their expense to redeem themselves from the food burning. Not Blue Fin.  The sushi my wife ordered tasted like Oahu 7-Eleven Sushi for $10-13. You're better off getting the Sushi from Smith's right down the road for $7.99 on Sunset. There's a better sushi (Island Sushi Grill) place on Eastern with great locals from Hawaii. They treat you like ohana and have yet to burn an order."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars for the service and the pricing of the all you can eat. The food is more like 3 stars. The fish is fresh but they use too much sauce. I don't like my rolls swimming in thick sauces, i want to taste the fish!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place only 3 stars because the staff was so nice, but the nigiri is average at best. As a hardcore sushi fan, I only order nigiri and sashimi when I eat out so this review is not for their rolls if you're a roll lover. Point to note: this restaurant does not have sashimi on their AYCE menu, but I've never been to such a place that insanely does that.

I ordered the following nigiri: salmon, mackerel, red snapper, unagi, albacore, and amebi (sweet shrimp). The unagi was delicious, but the rest were mediocre. The amebi should be called \"a-mini\" at this place because it was the perfect representation of Japanese related entities as depicted on Family Guy-- indeed it was \"tiny everyting.\" The sushi rice was unseasoned and dry, but was edible because I had waited until 3 p.m. to eat lunch. I also ordered a seaweed salad, which was not bad and tasted like all the seaweed salads I've ever tasted. 

Like I said, the staff was nice, but even at 3 p.m. when not many customers occupied the restaurant, service was slow. I appreciate the sushi chef though because he kept motioning the 5 or so servers to speed up. 

Overall, if you live in the Henderson area and are starving, this place is a great alternative to Goyemon, my favorite AYCE sushi place. But as someone who has had the best meal of her life at Shibuya at the MGM, Blue Fin is one step above super market sushi at best!"}
{"text":"After going on a hunt to find other great sushi spots within the Henderson area, this place is definitely the cream of the crop. Their specialty sushi rolls are deep fried/baked, and absolutely delicious! Fans of modern sushi/sushi with a twist will love it here. The sushi is more \"savory\" than sweet (the rolls were mostly combinations of the fish meat with other \"heavier\" type things like cream cheese, etc, and hardly any combinations of fish with fruit). I personally have to be in the mood for deep fried sushi, but when I am - this is the spot! Also, they have azuki bean (red bean) ice cream! So make sure you save room in your dessert stomach for something sweet.  Next time I go back, I'm looking forward to try one of their dinner specials."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place! I eat here honestly about once a week and the fish is always fresh. Super nice owners too, and the service is amazing! No complaints!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot in Vegas!! The all you can eat prices are awesome! The sushi was fresh and delicious!!! The service was pretty good... not the best but far from an issue. All in all a great spot and I will be returning... constantly!!!"}
{"text":"This was a real suprise negative experience because Yelpers are pretty happy with this place. The sushi was all sauces and toppings masking poor quality fish. The girlfriend didn't finish any of it which is rare. I ordered the katsu curry. Tasteless and bland while overcooked. The service was poor and e everyone was in a bad mood or generally unhappy people. Had to ask for water again and again. Was a bad experience and I won't be back for awhile. Never say never so ill assume they will get better or they won't last."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years. Usually every month or two. it's my go to Sushi Spot. AYCE is a good value considering how fresh everything tastes. I usually don't mess with rolls and strictly order off the nigiri menu. I don't know the staff by name but they recognize me so sometimes hook me up with limited edition pieces they get on occassion. Recently entertained some clients here for lunch. They had a new server I hadn't seen before but she was very nice and more personality that the girl that I have usually seen in the past."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.
Toyko roll.
Edamame.
Squid karage kushi.
Many many many more rolls throughout the night.

Only thing i don't like is that they sell soda by the can...i personally think fountain soda drinks taste better but i can overlook that!

Mmmmm."}
{"text":"We come here quite often every single time food is excellent, very busy yet well staffed and service is great. We even have a signature hand roll that Kevin has perfected and  surprisingly remembers it.."}
{"text":"Based on all the good reviews, my best friend and I thought maybe we came on an off night. It was our first experience here and we weren't impressed. The service was outstanding, but the food was not up to par. It was almost as if the fish wasn't fresh. We have been to quite a few different places so we know what to expect in our sushi. Everything we tried was medicore. We probably wont be returning to Blue Fin."}
{"text":"Came here for the last minute UYE. This was actually my first UYE and I had a great time. I ordered probably everything off the nigiri menu and it was excellent. The rolls were pretty good too, but i'm a nigiri/sashimi guy, and they were standout. They also have something called a mexican roll, and it was actually made from a tortilla shell, which was quite clever. The special that the sushi chef made were raw oysters with tobiko and another fish egg, and lychee sorbet! It was so good. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Had the AYCE and no where near as good as Sushi Koma on the west side or Sushi Twister on Boulder . Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"So...I'm in Vegas visiting my friend and we wanted some sushi..so I looked up some stuff on Yelp and found this place. We had good service, good beer and overall we enjoyed everything. The main problem I have with this place is that they use imitation crab in every roll except the soft shell crab rolls. ( I don't like soft shell crab so I guess I'm SOL) My friend didn't mind at all because she said that she can't tell the difference. I CAN tell the difference! I just don't get it!! Don't say it's crab if it's not crab!! WTF! You don't put fake tuna in your roll...so why put fake crab?? Anyway I do have to say although the crab was fake the rolls were still very good. I really liked the Wet Dream. We both agreed that it was our favorite. Overall the service was good, the rolls were pretty and good and the beers...also good."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of the best AYCE places I've had. I think it's even  better than Goyemon in my opinion. 

All the rolls I've tried are full of flavor and each roll that I've had has had a different unique flavor. I like getting the blue fin special and the super white tiger. The fish is fresh and the rolls aren't doused in eel sauce, which makes me a happy camper. 

The rolls are big so beware and dont over order. Blue fin is now in my rotation of sushi restaurants when I crave sushi. 

All rolls come out in a timely manner, and they aren't over wrapped with rice. I think you definitely get quality fish here for AYCE."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was decent,  but the service was awful.  We were not greeted at the door with someone behind the counter.  The waiter was slow and not friendly. Get some cheerful personalities and we would return ."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Period. Every time my wife and I try another sushi spot, we always tend to compare it to this place. Been coming here a couple years now, and never disappointed."}
{"text":"they gave me food poisoning  last night 2/12/16..  don't eat their!!! The worst place ever... what a shit hole.. it's very obvious to me that the owners have no respect for their clients or they wouldn't serve such shity slop.."}
{"text":"The more AYCE sushi I have in Vegas, the more I appreciate a la carte places: they typically have the quality I want, without the obligation to overeat to \"get my money's worth\". I'd be in trouble if I lived closer to Blue Fin, because it's a good combination of the best of both worlds!

Came in on a random weekday evening, sampled a bunch of their apps (the poke was a bit spicy, the screaming o was mostly sauce, and the tempura soft shell crab was a flavorless half crab), lots of nigiri (the garlic tuna and spicy garlic tuna were both standouts!) and a few of their rolls (the featured special roll, CM4? was the best). 

Fish was fresh, rolls were tight, rice was correctly portioned, and even better than all of the above was the service. Like I said, I tend to overdo it at AYCE joints, but the servers here were super-fast and nonjudgmental- every time more food was brought out, they'd ask without batting an eye what we'd like next."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and never had a bad experience until today. I ordered 3 orders of spicy garlic tuna and not once was it brought to us. So the 3rd time waitress very nice asked if I got everything. I told her no 3 times I've yet to get my order. Then my sister orders baked mussels. She pulled one out with legs. Looked like a baby crab. When we asked the waiter what it was just made a joke and avoided the question 2 times. These last 3 visits have been bad,  but this one takes the prize. I let the waiter know that I was drinking lemonade he poured me water 3 times. Probably won't be back for 25.99 dinner and I have to have a bad experience every time I'll save my money."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always fresh & delicious. Been here several times & never disappoints. They do great @ accommodating large groups too,"}
{"text":"Food was good but only issue I found was the tables being too close to the wall which made eating very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. And real Asians making your sushi. Most of our sushi in Vegas are no longer made by Asians. The Latin peeps are taking that over also."}
{"text":"Great sushi and service, off the beaten path.  Everything is fresh, well prepared, and delivered to your table in record time. Don't be scared off by the all the you can eat pricing.  Blue Fin is not like any of the other all you can eat sushi joints.  It is a great value."}
{"text":"Ate here once with the wifey. Typical all you can eat sushi place. You order from a menu and staff brings out your food. They seem to be faster at getting your food out compared to say island sushi. The food taste great and the prices are really reasonable. Can't do much better imho. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good place if you like deep fried sushi. All of the rolls besides nigri are deep fried or have some component of deep fried food in them.

No basic baked rolls.

Pushy service to the point it was overwhelming.

Nice interior."}
{"text":"Truly excellent sushi! I discovered that they do and all you can eat in the afternoons with a few ground rules. You have to eat everything on the dish did you order before you order another dish (like something your mom would tell you) :), any only get like an hour and a half. But seriously, do you really want to continue to eat any food for longer than an hour and a half?
The fish was definitely top shelf. The sauces and glazes where use conservatively and effectively. I've been back twice and have had a consistently great experience. Try their signature rolls or their signature apps, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So what if I'm a little late in writing reviews?  Granted that I moved away from Henderson in June of 2012 and have been eating there from 2009 until I left, but better late than never I suppose...

Where to start?  I lived at the apartments by that intersection and EVERY SINGLE DAY after school I had to make a decision. Make a left to go home or make a right to Blue Fin.  Let me tell you, 8 times out of 10, Blue Fin won.

Their lunch special portions are great for the price.  I usually get the 2-roll lunch special and end up not having dinner.  In the event that I go for AYCE (which is quite often), I LOVE their ikura (I think it's the best in Vegas) and that one roll with the guacamole (I KNOW, right? Don't judge until you try it) is amazing.  It may not be the most traditional sushi joint ever (especially since I have been spoiled by Little Tokyo in LA), but it's sushi with a little 'fun' mixed into it (without being too far out).

The staff has always been awesome and very attentive. I've never had a problem there. Once and a while I'll take my notes with me to study while I sit and eat yummy sushi in the patio area. Also, whenever my family comes to visit me from California, I always take them to Blue Fin.

So sad that I moved to Oregon...I've been missing Blue Fin since."}
{"text":"I would say it tasted like store bought sushi, but I would never insult Whole Foods like that. 

We tried Blue Fin because it was closer to my neighborhood than my go-to spot. The reviews on Yelp (thanks guys -_-) seemed great, so we decided to try it. How can I put this...Blue Fin is like that pathetic ex boyfriend that you refuse to waste your unlimited text messages on.

At the start of our meal, we were greeted by a smile-less \"have you been helped already?\" Now keep in mind this is a sit down sushi restaurant, not a fast food establishment. Shortly after sunshine took our orders, the appetizers arrived. It must've been fate or something because I've always wanted to try really chewy calamari! The kind where you take one bight, and the whole thing comes out of the skin because it was cooked so well! How did they know?!! 

Then we received our rolls. Are you people effing kidding me? Yes, the rolls are big, but I prefer quality over quantity. They are made with too much overcooked rice and last week's catch of the day. So gross. So once our first roll came out, we decided  to be brave and try other things off the menu since we ordered the all you can eat. Where was our server? In the corner, staring blankly at the t.v above our table. I was staring at her, said excuse me, sent a pigeon, and shot a flare gun trying to get her attention...NOPE. 

Our busser was great! He took our drink orders, cleared our dishes, took the majority of our food orders and wait...where was our waitress?? Standing in the corner of the 10x10 box, (in which they call a restaurant) staring at the t.v and checking her phone. You could tell it was the type of place where they shared tips, otherwise I would've would've only gave 10%. I really hope he got my tip because she didn't deserve it.

At the end of our meal, she just drops off the check. No smile, no \"thank you\" nothing. So that's when I asked \"were you our server?\" She said \"yes\". To which I replied \"really? Cause the busser took most of our orders while you were just standing in the corner watching tv.\" \"Then she said  \"the bussers are supposed to do that, whoever is closer. I did not watch tv at all.\" \"Do you feel like you did a good job? Cause I did not.\" Her response was \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\" Thank you for your backwards apology sweetie. I really appreciated it. I'm sorry too. I'm sorry that not only was the food disgusting, so was your attitude. 

To put it simply, our server's name was Jin. If she's not your server, I'm pretty sure you'll have a tolerable experience. If she is, hold up your cross and run away!!"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere were great, and the sushi was some of the best I've had! Highly recommend this place to anyone from, visiting, or passing through Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit if you enjoy sushi. The special roles that they make will knock your socks off. Sashimi was as fresh as any I have ever had. The owners are very personable and service was outstanding. If I could give this more stars I would."}
{"text":"I thought the place was pretty great. My first time going to a sushi restaurant with a group of people who love sushi. I got a lunch special with a choice of two rolls and it came with soup and salad. It was all very tasty, I really enjoyed it. I would, and probably will return in the future. We shared entrees and there were other dishes that were even better tasting than mine. Very yummy. The inside of the restaurant was clean and modern; great environment."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!
Sat at the bar and he custom made rolls
For me based on what I love.  So fresh & delish!  It's right by my house. I go all the time."}
{"text":"Great service! Food came out super fast! Every roll was consistently delicious 
The salmon was also really good and the super white tuna a couple of my favorites! 
Ultimate blue fun roll  wet dream  must
 try and the Royal shrimp ENJOY GREAT PLACE FOR AYCE!!!"}
{"text":"Great place and our go to for sushi.  Food is always good and fresh and the owner, Jin, takes a personal interest in the service his guests receive.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"I am sad to write this review. A friend took us to the lunch special a year or so ago. I was disappointed when eating with my party of 7 for the ayce. Service was excellent as far as wait staff and friendliness. But sushi was subpar. The nigiri was thin and rice would not even stay on it to pick it up. The rolls were similar. I found the menu lacking in creativity and quality was just not there in comparison to other sushi places."}
{"text":"Fun and interesting rolls beyond the usual California or Philadelphia, but they have those too if you want it. Standout item has to be the Spicy Garlic Tuna nigiri. Be sure to try the iced green tea too. Great wait staff and a nice quiet atmosphere you don't typically get at AYCE sushi spots."}
{"text":"Fair price for all you can eat sushi.  The food was good and the service was attentive.  Their Strawberry Nigori Sake is a MUST HAVE!  I've NEVER had sake so good!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Blue Fin for a late lunch on Valentine's Day. Hostess was courteous and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the spacious seating, which is fairly hard to come by in a sushi establishment. Will come back with the kids, as many families were dining there with young children. Our server was very attentive and we were able to customize our sushi orders, i.e. half orders, add crunch etc. Appetizers were delicious albeit lacking a bit in variety. $21.99 for lunch is a great value!! We will definitely be returning!!

Great food and great service. 
The Sushi is delicious!!!
The service and the quality of ingredients is outstanding."}
{"text":"Place is small, you can sit outside... In this heat, no thanks.

Service was BAD. We had to ask multiple times for things. My fiance had plastic,

YES PLASTIC in his water.

Food, is mehh. We've had better.

My 5 month old daughter was with us, and her outfit had gotten messy while we were there, so I took her in the bathroom, and changed her, without making a scene. However, I had a mommy brain fart, and forgot to pack a second outfit.

It was a week day, and the place was NOT busy. So, because I knew that we were just waiting for dessert and the check, I walked out with her in a blanket and her diaper. 

The waitress just had to ask why my baby was \"naked.\" Making it seem like I was an unfit parent. Almost drawing attention to our table. Making us very uncomfortable.

We couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"Originally I ate here because it was close to where I live and I just wanted some late night sushi but this place has quickly turned into one of my favorites which is rare since I can be a picky sushi eater. My favorite all time rolls here are the Wet Dream and Royal shrimp which I will probably get every time I go here. I sat at a normal 2 person table and service was fast and steady as far as I can remember. Only thing I can think of to improve would be to not have to wait so long in between rolls"}
{"text":"My friend had the grilled teriyaki beef last Friday night. He immediately threw up and was sick all weekend"}
{"text":"We go here once a week. Seriously. Once a week! Both the chef and I enjoy the varity of rolls and our service has always been spectacular. Here are a few of our favorite rolls:

{"text":"I love sushi!! It was my first time at this Sushi Restaurant. Food was OK. Nothing really stood out but I have to admit their portions for AYCE was pretty generous and the price was decent for the overall experience."}
{"text":"This is probably my least favorite ayce sushi joint. Service wasn't the best. They apparently ran out of certain items and failed to notify the table until when I asked again before I got the check. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Not bad. Ambience was just too quiet and bright. Night wasn't busy, was seated in back room by sushi bar. 2 servers and a bus boy. No one could refill our waters. I'm a server myself and I just felt our server didn't enjoy her job.  Food was decent, not the best. Rolls were overly sauced up, and rice kept falling apart from nigiri."}
{"text":"A LOT of my yelp peers hold Blue Fin very VERY highly and i've only been here once but i feel that the service was just a bit off the night we went. 

We put in a few orders of salmon skin hand rolls and they didnt come out till the end of our meal so that was a bit weird. And other little mix-ups like orders coming in that belonged to the other side of the table. 

Ordered and tasted way too many different types of rolls to make any kind of useful list. But of the various things we did order it's very noticeable that the fish is fresh and the spicy tuna and yellow tails have just the right amount of spicy bite that makes it enjoyable but not holy crap holy crap holy crap kill me now my insides are on fire. 

Overall i'd love to come back with a considerably smaller group but alas i live on the opposite side of town..."}
{"text":"This place is always good for all you can eat sushi.  I get it for lunch when I am at the office and for dinner when the kids feel like sushi.  Their garlic tuna is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've read the reviews for this place and had high expectations. Had being the key word. Me and the wife had the AYCE, and we chose this place based off of the good reviews from other yelpers. Overall I believe this place is lacking.... In everything. We checked out the menu and majority of it had crab meat, imitation at that. Limited menu compared to other sushi places. Only certain rolls you could get at half rolls where other places like Kaizen you can get their whole menu in half rolls. Service was adequate for us, but there were two guys sitting at the bar and the two servers (male and female) were making fun of them because of what they were wearing, and the male server was on his iPhone leaning against the bar. The sushi we got was par, nothing great. Mostly rice and crab meat which to me seems like a way to make us full faster. All in all we were both disappointed, to say the least."}
{"text":"Blue Fin is my go to sushi spot in Las Vegas.From the delicious spicy garlic tuna, to the creative yet tasty rolls. All the fish is fresh, from the super white tuna to the eel. I have been coming here even before the expansion when they were a little building. I suggest this place to any sushi lover or anybody who is looking to try a new sushi place.10 stars."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to admit I have a prejudice. I believe the idea of all you can eat and sushi reflects on the quality of the products they use. I was wrong, so wrong, and I'm sorry it took me so long to see the light.
Blue Fin is a great establishment. The fish is incredible, I mean fresh, clean, and can balance traditional cutting method with inventive items. They already have a great menu, but are able to create items based on your personal taste that will blow you away. The service is incredibly friendly, and the chefs are so skilled. So glad I found them!"}
{"text":"After our group of people (15 at minimum) waited over an hour at another place to be served our food, we decided to walk out and come here instead. We called as we were on the way and were told there would be no problem. 

We were able to sit in one large group (thanks to some awesome patrons who offered to move tables for us), but it was a bit cramped. 

I wish the place was a little bigger for the indoor only season (they have a nice patio, but it wasn't furnished at the time - not sure if it was for the season or if they don't offer outdoor seating). 

The flavors were amazing, as usual, and the service was exceptional. The server kept up with drinks while also keeping orders straight. They were friendly, upbeat and professional. They did not seem frantic or worried at any point. 

The only thing that keeps them from a 5 star rating is the time limit on their AYCE. I believe it's within 60 minutes... or 90. 

Considering they are a quick service establishment, I wont let this little detail keep me away!"}
{"text":"This quaint sushi joint is my all time favorite in Henderson. They have the freshest fish, all you can eat and the chefs always remember us when we return and what we ordered last. They just expanded their space to accommodate the influx of sushi lovers. 

This was my hidden little secret, but the word got out and I am sooo happy for the owners and chefs. Don't let the outside of the building psych you out... Because you won't be disappointed by the greatness and the extensive menu selections."}
{"text":"Date night last night and Blue Fin did not let us down. Best sushi outside Nobu I've found. I really like nigiri & their Hamachi and salmon were amazing. My only complaint would be the different special sauces can be overpowering, but the sushi chef was happy to omit the sauce. AYCE is simple and reasonable.  Service was quick even though the place was packed. This place is an absolute winner."}
{"text":"Just went for ayce lunch. Have to say this is the best in Vegas. My son and I had about 12 different rolls. Some were tapa though. Every one was excellent. We devoured all of them. Well worth the $21.95. this will be my go to spot from now on."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, and the ambiance was pleasing. The food was great, too! Although I don't consider myself a sushi snob, I have had less than stellar sushi, and this was pretty darn good sushi."}
{"text":"Food was meh. Fish wasn't fresh. Rolls was sloppy. Mussels was yucky. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I promised Lisa L that I would try Blue Fin again, and it was on the way back from California (forgiveness please for the dilatoriness). While everything had a nice presentation and the service was VERY friendly, the taste was still not there.

I started with salmon sashimi, not the best piece of salmon ever but not the worst either and came with a pretty radish garnish. 

The server brought out edamame, a nice gesture and not commonly complimentary at sushi places. It was dried out but can't complain too much for the price.

Salmon skin salad was hefty, a whole lotta skin to go around. However, there was too much sauce again. The vinaigrette was overwhelming and permeated the greens completely. Imitation crab was just sad (a big let down after being in Maryland where there is shellfish aplenty), especially for a sushi place. Don't even try this at home.

Caterpillar roll also was drenched in eel sauce and it was impossible to taste the actual eel in it. I did like the generous amounts of avocado wrapped around it, but all I could taste was rice and sauce.

It is open late which is another plus, but I suppose not my cup of green tea (pun horribly intended)."}
{"text":"Defiently a great spot to go if you like fun, upbeat, and quick service. Food came out quickly, and they always made sure that all my needs where attended to. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"The star of the show here was the tempura ice cream. I have been dreaming about having this again since we came here. Besides that, I didn't care for this place too much. The fish was all drenched in vinegar, which I'm not a fan of. I prefer for them to use that sparingly. I could tell the fish was good but I couldn't really enjoy that when it was covered vinegar and sauces."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing AYCE sushi with many other options. I have been here all times of the day, lunch and dinner on weekdays and weekends and have always had amazing service and great sushi. The fish is always fresh and they have great turn around time. I've been going to Blue Fin for years now and don't know of many other sushi places that can compare."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Freshest sushi I have ever had in Vegas. I suggest the firecracker roll for those who like deep fried rolls. My favorites are the salmon killer and the rainbow roll."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, the sushi is great but service is horrible. Numerous times they've brought stuff to our table that we didn't order and we had to send it away. This last time the same girl kept bringing stuff that wasn't ours and even one time after sending her away
A waiter came over and rudely said \" ,you didn't order that\" and my boyfriend got a bit short with him because they were the ones who didn't have there shit together
Very good rolls but the frustration at their unprofessional service was not worth it and a gal who took our order came back 10 min later because she had forgotten part of the order just to have a more pleasant experience I'll stick with another place next time"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Very fresh!  Clean place.. good all you can eat prices.  I had a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm very glad I popped into this place. I ordered sashimi sushi and the portions were very, very generous. I also had the volcano roll which was amazing. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here. Found my favorite weekend dinner date. The waiters and the manager are always welcoming 
The food is always fresh and they're always happy to see us. Couldn't say one bad thing about this place. The later you go the less crowded it gets about (830ish)
Couldn't stop coming here. Still haven't burned out on this restaurant. And it only seems to get better every time we come back. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"Going to update this review, we came here for dinner service tonight. The hostess sat us at a dirty table. We had the all you can eat option. 

We started our first set of orders with the: ahi poki salad, garlic tuna, crazy jalapeño. 

The next round we had volcano, Johnny Johnny,  and Dr.  After the first round, I did notice that they started to pile in the rice, to fill us up faster. 

All of our food was very good and was made very well. I'm dropping a star because of the hostess who sat us at a dirty table, took our first order and made us wait 15 minutes before she sent anyone else over to check on us."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because the reviews spoke highly about the sushi but I'd have to say I've had better.  It wasn't completely bad but it wasn't the freshest. I'm giving it 3 stars because it's just that....3 stars."}
{"text":"Blue Fin struck me as one of many acceptable, but pretty much mediocre AYCE sushi establishments in Las Vegas. There are many of these and they are okay to go to if you happen to be in the neighborhood and are in the mood for stuffing yourself silly full of not GREAT, but still tasty fish bits.

But if we are talking about trying to find exceptional Japanese food experiences, then this isn't really the place for it. Subpar miso soup. Strange fluorescent green seaweed salad. Fish with not the freshest feeling texture. And fairly average sushi preparation. 

I've given them a try, but am now going to go back to some of the other better Japanese restaurants of which there are a few nearby."}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE sushi place. There specialty rolls have a lot of extra sauce plus flavoring in mg opinion so I would ask for less or no sauce"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with my boyfriend tonight, it was a great meal! We had the AYCE option and got multiple orders of nigiri; several orders of yellowtail [probably too many, but it's the boy's fave and sooooo good], salmon, tuna, uni, unagi, amaebi & octopus/tako. All were fresh, tasted sweet and the uni, unagi and amaebi were especially fabulous. The uni was the freshest I've had at any AYCE, with a glossy sheen and a lovely buttery, creamy texture and sweet, subtle flavor. Unagi pieces were large, supple, served warm with the sauce warm and thick. Normally not a particular fan of unagi, it looked so good that the boy couldn't resist. The amaebi were like the photograph, with a gorgeous sheen and transparent, tender flesh, as well as having the deepfried heads to the side. The boy was impressed by how the drops of batter on the end of the shrimp's whisker/spine looked like a flower. :} I ate the heads, and they were great- had a good flavor and were cooked perfectly. We also tried the Rock n' Roll and the Bluefin Special roll. The Bluefin special was the better of the two, with a great spicy sauce studded with lots of masago and herbs. Very flavorful & quite a big roll. The Rock n Roll was tasty, but it lacked the sauce that makes it truly outstanding. We were still happy to see it on the menu, though. At one point, we asked the chef to create a special of his choice for us and he made a roll with lots of yellowtail, masago, crab, herbs and other things. Very yummy. Tried the calimari tempura and baked green mussels as well. The calimari had a light crispy coating, not too greasy, and had a nice springiness without being too chewy. My boyfriend was particularly enamored with the presentation of the mussels, in a small bowl with little indents to hold the individual mussels in a bath of flavorful mayo sauce. Lastly, the poki salad was good. It was a combination of tuna, seaweed salad, shredded daikon, lots of herbs, and a flavorful sauce- and was another favorite of the boy. There were many layers of flavor, and it was different from the usual poki I run into. It was actually the first thing we tried and we were both rapidly impressed. 
It was quiet when we went, so the orders were prompt and we were given ample attention. As soon as we finished the waitress cleared the path for the next order, and both sushi chefs were friendly and chatted with us while we ate. Two other groups ate during the time we were there, which makes me glad because the food is GOOD, and this place needs to prosper! If you're in the area, go here for a good sushi meal, then drop by The Olive for a post-dinner drink and a hookah at reasonable prices. Awesome, awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always fresh, exactly what you would expect from a great local sushi joint. During prime dinner time be prepared to take a seat and wait, but I promise you it will be worth the wait. They do have an all you can eat lunch/dinner special, personally I have never done it for 2 reasons. #1 - they will only serve you one roll at a time and will not bring you the next roll until you finish what is on your plate (I like to take my time and try a few different ones all at the same time). If you don't finish you can't take anything home and you will be charged for the full roll price. #2 - Between my husband and I, we will order 4 rolls (normally 2 specialties and 2 normals) and we are stuffed. Kicker is, we pay less than the all you can eat special, and that's with 2 beers. So doesn't really make sense for us. I'm sure if you came with a really big appetite you would eat your $$ worth. If you haven't tried this place already, there is no time like the present!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Thanks Lisa for introducing us all to this place.  I'm just bummed I didn't make one of your UYEs sooner!  

I'm usually not a big AYCE fan.  Too much fried stuff, too many rules. But here they gave us anything we wanted, including salmon or yellowtail collar (1 per person but its huge!), for the bargain dinner price of $25.99.  And they were willing to customize everything, which was impressive.  Eric ordered some great salmon nigiri with avocado that was not on the menu.  You can order half rolls if you don't want to commit to a full roll. My favorite was probably the garlic tuna nigiri.  Yummy.  I could eat that all night.  We also had red and green tobiko.  Very Christmasy.  The only thing I will avoid in the future is a crazy yum yum sauce.  I should have taken Lisa's advice and got it on the side.  Too mayonnaisey. (I'm just making up all my words today!) We got some special rolls that were amazing.  One with chopped up soft shell crab and salmon.  Sooo good.

The other nice thing was that they have a variety of desserts and you can get as many as you want for the AYCE price.  Most places it is just mochi.  Their strawberries jubilee with caramelized strawberry sauce, vanilla ice cream, and a warm beignet... amazing!  

I did enjoy the fact that my dining companions did not have sushi phobia and didn't insist on ordering everything fried or with cream cheese like some of my other friends do.  That makes AYCE miserable for me because then they can't eat it all and look to me to help, which I don't want to do.  Service here was excellent and they don't enforce the 60 minute time limit or eat everything rule too strictly.  But still, it's rude to order a ton of food and then leave it on the table.  No worries with this crowd.  Great time, great place.  I'm definitely dragging my husband here.  He hates AYCE, but I'm sure he'll love this place."}
{"text":"All you can eat, made to order sushi!  hurray!  I can't stand sushi that has been sitting out on a buffet line, it's just not right!

First off the rice in the nigiri was a little bigger than i like, and seemed to be old, possibly reheated, but I guess thats to be expected at all you can eat.

The fish: they did not offer toro, but the Super White Tuna (Escolar, Walu if you're from Hawaii) more than made up for that, super soft, tender and buttery;  just don't eat too much, (google it, you'll see why) 1 or 2 orders per person should be fine.  Hamachi, Hirame, Tai, Salmon, unagi, were all good.  Spicy tuna hand roll was packed full to the top and is an attempt to copy the spicy tuna of Hawaii's genki sushi (the gold standard of spicy tuna).  It has sesame oil and tobiko for some texture.  The owner is from Hawaii, so i guess he would know.

I'm not one usually for rolls but i did get a few just to try.  I highly suggest you try the Yuri roll, a california roll placed on is side covered with avocado, scallop dynamite, and eel sauce.  Rich, fatty and delicious!

Appetizers, and desserts are all you can eat too!

I like their hours, 11 - 11, they don't close between lunch and dinner, so you can go whenever.  No ridiculous lines (at least for now), Friendly and attentive service.  I suggest you go here if you are tired of waiting in line at your fav AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group and were seated right away. The service was good. I would give the service 4.5 stars. The sushi was sub-par. The nigiri had very thin slices of fish and way too much rice. Every roll I ordered was drenched in sauce, perhaps to mask that the fish isn't very fresh. Again, waaaaaay too much rice! I feel like they want to stuff you with rice so you don't order so much for AYCE. I don't know why there are such fabulous reviews about this place. Perhaps because others haven't tried Goyemon or Yama or Sushimon. For those sushi connoisseurs please skip this place unless you have a hankering for a lot of sushi rice."}
{"text":"Blue Fin is a delicious tuna but not my favorite sushi place. I thought they were closed when we first walked in because we were literally the only couple there. We walked through an entire room of empty tables and were sat at a table next to the bar. I don't mind that at all - it helps the food come fast! The place filled up as we are, sort of. It was still half empty on our way out. We may have just come at a weird time but it was around dinner. 

Thier sushi is good, their fish is fresh. I don't have any complaints about that portion. Their rolls left something to be desired. Again, as usual, I ate everything but wasn't blown away by anything. Their service is average, which isn't a problem if your food is great but if your food is average you should at least make it up in service. The selection of appetizers is lacking. The only appetizer that I loved was the soft shell crab. The mussels tasted like cheese, and I know cheese normally comes on baked mussels, but this was not my style. I could hardly taste the mussels it felt like I was just eating melted cheese. 

I love that fried ice cream is included in the price, the normal sushi place I go to makes you pay extra for anything but mochi. We got vanilla fried ice cream and it came with chocolate syrup and whipped cream and was easily the most delicious and satifsying part of my meal."}
{"text":"First of all the service here is horrible.  The servers all seems to more like a robot.  They do not engage with the guest and have no personalities.  As for the sushi, I had the ayce and ordered few nigiri, special cut rolls and a couple of hand rolls, and it was all average.  No desert choices, which is a pity.  Small bottle of sparkling water cost about $4, which I feel is insane, knowing this place is not a fine dining establishment.  The outlet itself seems dated with no atmosphere and the music was overpowering which made the dining experience poor.  I would not recommend this place.  There are a lot of better sushi joints around town."}
{"text":"I love this place! We typically go to Yama Sushi, but since the word is out of what a great place they are, it's hard to get in there on any night for dinner, so we have been going to Blue Fin! Their AYCE is $25.99 per person I believe for dinner and includes everything on the menu. My favorite item on the menu is the garlic tuna and super white tuna. I'm still a sushi newbie for the most part, as I just began eating fish a little over a year ago for the first time in my life, so Nigiri/Sashimi is a little intimidating for me, seeing a big hunk of raw fish on a small round of rice. However, both are so delicious! Their super white tuna is so silky it melts in your mouth. My favorite rolls are the Royal Philly (deep fried philly roll), the Hawaiian Roll, and their new one called an Italian Roll.  It has (forgot what type of fish) but a balsamic oil on top of it. YUM!  
Also, if you like green mussells, or mussels in general, try their baked green mussels. My BF ordered 4 of these the first time he tried them, and the other day he ordered 3 of them. We even got a first time visitor to Blue Fin to rave about them.  They're shucked pieces of mussel in a tiny round dish with about 7 little wells each with a piece of mussel. It's then covered in what seems/looks like butter and/or mayo, and then some kind of cheese and baked. My BF loves it!  No restrictions on how many either. They also offer tempura ice cream in either green tea or vanilla. We had it last time and they had carmelized strawberries on it. Sooo good!  Definitely check it out!


***update***
12/27/11 - reading over my review to see if any of my Yelp friends have checked the place out yet, I noticed I said shucked when speaking of mussels. Apparently, I had too much sake that night."}
{"text":"I love Blue Fin. Just come here. End of review.

No really. Just come here. They have AYCE sushi. AYCE sushi is top secret code for we love feeding you sushi until you burst. They have some amazing sushi. 

Speciality sushi rolls are all the bomb. Ultimate blue fin, volcano, and *** are just some. Some of the rolls are loaded with sauce so just ask them for sauce on the side or ask for half roll as is.

I even did the hand rolls which comes in a stand that can hold 3 hand rolls and sometimes they're so big that the stand can't hold it so no stand is used. Try the salmon skin hand roll its good.

For nigiri all excellent choices. I had lots of nigiri uni with quails egg, tako octopus,... Get the garlic ahi nigiri drool.

The poke salad was ok. It was stretched out with lots of non-ahi ingredients like some of the other sushi spots here.

They didn't have oysters on the AYCE menu and I didn't order shrimp tempura but everything else was amazing enough to make me not care about it. 

For desserts they have red bean ice cream, not small scoops but regular size ice cream scoops. Mochi and fried tempura ice cream. All that are also AYCE.

So good that I almost did AYCE lunch the day after I did AYCE dinner. When's the next time. I'm actually craving sushi today. Next time has to be tonight LOL

Premature yelp review post. Noticed I wasn't finish."}
{"text":"The pros: fish to rice ratio on nigiri, service, quality of fish, green tea ice cream

The cons: $21/lunch, screaming o was covered in watery mayo, tuna poke had sliced carrots (but I like the seaweed salad addition), baked mussels were covered in mozzarella cheese, fried soft shell crab was a ball of fried oil, crab \"meat\" still looked like imitation crab (I've never pulled meat from a crab that looked like that), mochi was overly frozen

Overall I always order nigiri so I wasn't too disappointed by the things that I didn't like, I just prefer the traditional take on baked mussels and tuna poke. I will come back because it's near by new job and my sons preschool.

Lastly, I have to apologize to the staff because I was freaking out about lost sunglasses and I found them. My bad y'all. This means I have to tip more next time. Party foul."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day and it was packed, but the service was great. The food was delicious and very fairly priced. We will be back."}
{"text":"The companion and I were looking to get some good sushi on our way out of town and AYCE definitely sounded great. We got a tip on this place from my friend Yelp so we drove across town to check it out.

We honestly thought it was closed because the parking lot was nearly as empty as the inside of the restaurant. However when we got inside we were guided to our seats at the sushi bar and greeted by a very exuberant sushi chef. We perused the menu for a moment and began the ordering frenzy. AYCE be damned, we were going for the gold.

After several rolls of varying shapes and sizes we began asking for suggestions. The chef is very amusing, often tempting us with other people's orders and simply saying \"don't be shy, order more!\" To which was happily replied, \"oh we will... we will.\"

And we did this, through several different rolls. I have a couple of favorites:

White Tuna Nigiri: Super clean and fresh. Cut superbly and just melts in your mouth.

Unagi Hand Roll: As good as you can get anywhere. Definitely fresh and the sauce they drizzle on top is great.

Blu-Fin Special Roll: Perfection. Just try it and you'll understand.

We made an excellent decision to come here. I highly recommend you visit this place whether you're a local or a visitor. It may be a moderate drive across town, but the quality is worth the trek."}
{"text":"Sushi fresh flown in fron Hawaii.  Great prices.  Available parking.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"A year and a half after asking Yelp where to get AYCE sushi, we finally got around to trying Blue Fin. We went at about 7 pm on a Friday and only waited about 5 minutes for a table. This was impressive, since this place is teeny tiny. 

The staff is super friendly and eager to serve. 

All in all, we ended up with: Rainbow roll, Tiger roll, White Tiger roll, Red Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and the Wet Dream roll, plus vegetable tempura. All of is was fabulous! The White Tiger roll is very garlicky and amazing. The Red Dragon is a must for tuna lovers. The Wet Dream is ultra rich and should be eaten while you have plenty of belly room. The only roll I didn't love was the Caterpillar; the eel sauce at Blue Fin tastes very caramel-y, something I don't love. 

The AYCE selection is really, really great. If you can't find a handful of rolls, hand rolls and nigiri that you like, you clearly don't like sushi as much as you think. Anyway, here are the details I couldn't find beforehand: AYCE has an hour time limit. There's a separate menu for it. They say that they'll charge you the full price of any roll you don't finish, but we didn't finish one and weren't charged for it. I don't get the impression that they're sticklers for the rules, which is great (as long as you don't abuse them!). Its $25.99 for dinner, $21.99 for lunch. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved here from SoCal and have been on the hunt for a good sushi spot. Well.... I think we found it!!! We decided to do the all you can eat sushi and I definitely think that's the best way to go! Our favorite rolls by far were, the gangnam style roll, mexican roll, and the wet dream! However, we were still not disappointed by the other rolls we ordered! Everyone from the servers to the sushi chefs were so nice. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tonight I couldn't do AYCE so I go with their sushi combo.
It's set up menu so I couldn't change sushi but it's fair enough.
Tuna, slmon, shrimp, eel, yellowtail,  red snapper and I picked spicy tuna roll. It comes with miso soup and salad.
Sushi rice was good and fish was good too.
My other yelper friends did AYCE, so I can check their order with my own eyes. Everything looks good. 
Their service was good too. 
Next time I'll go for AYCE."}
{"text":"Way too much sugar. If you want to kill a diabetic friend or secretly want to fatten up your mate take them here. Everything was obnoxiously sweet to the point it masked the flavor of the fish."}
{"text":"Blue Fin was our first time dining. It was ABOLUTELY EXCELLENT!!!!! All you can eat!!!! We arrived and was greeted by everyone when we walked in the door. The service was absolutely excellent! The food was SO GOOD!!!! Such variety and the sushi rolls are so good!!!!!! The service was so fast! And the proportions were large and stacked with all the ingredients! We will Definately be BACK!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. I enjoy having lunch here; the food and service reliably meet expectations and I leave happy -- Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 4+ years! Never disappoints! Try their lunch combo or their royal California! They have AYCE as well! Just don't have the appetite for that!"}
{"text":"Best All You Can Eat in Las Vegas!!!
If you like authentic Japanese food, try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week since it's right by my office. I have never been disappointed! They have decent lunch specials for around $8 and it comes with miso soup and a salad. IDK what they put on the salad but I don't really care for it so I double up on the miso soup. 

The AYCE is a fair price at lunch and they have a large variety of food to choose from. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. 

Defffff check this place out if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Came in for lunch to wait for my car being repaired next door and was pleasantly surprised.  The food is very good and the portions are good as well.

My wife and I both ordered from the lunch special menu.  She had the 2 roll combo with Miso Soup and salad for $8.95.  The eel and spicy yellowtail were tasty.  And the also enjoyed the soup and the salad.

As I was not wanting Sushi, I opted for the chicken teriyaki bowl for $7.95 which also came with the soup and salad.

We will both come back here again."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE with Lily last night; completely worth the trip from Summahood to Hendertucky for this cute little spot I'd have easily driven past without Yelpers. (I did circumnavigate the building trying to find the front door...cuz I'm cool like that) For almost the whole time, we had the place to ourselves and that was great. Filled up later with obvious regulars. 

Now, I'd been waiting all day to chow down and try to thank Lilz for saving my life (AYCE = the international symbol for \"I love you, man\") and we were two chicks with a mission. We had: edamame, teryaki veggies, super white tuna, hamachi, salmon, halibut, tuna, & uni nigiri. All were very good: I really liked the fish:rice ratio and the rice was delicately flavored and held up nicely. Can always tell I'm loving my sushi when I don't even pour soy sauce. Mmmm. Neither had interest in the mayo/funny named rolls: instead Lily suggested the Salmon Skin hand roll \"Sunnyside Up\" (chef referred to adding yummy quail egg this way) This could be one of my new favorite things!!! So delish, textures & flavors galore. We finished out with a cucumber roll, both readying to throw in the towel. Those last few bits of rice were hard to manage: but we are badass!!! 

Of course all of that \"I can't eat another bite\" disappeared when I spied my kryptonite = strawberry mochi :))) Lily had the green tea tempura ice cream, which of course I HAD to taste and it was light and refreshing. 

The sushi chefs and servers were quick and friendly and even brought a whole pot of green tea to Lily while keeping my water full. Only a couple of misses: gyoza we did not order appeared and left, and they brought vanilla tempura (didn't ask which when she ordered) but cheerfully swapped it out. 

Only gave 4* because I didn't eat as much as I have @ UYE/I can't move feasts, but the quality of food and service lead me to believe I'll bump up on future visits. And there will be future visits when I'm lamenting my bud being in the City by the Bay...or just in the mood for some great eats with matching service. 

Thank you, Lily & Blue Fin!!'

*** Update. Lilz reminded me that we had the Amaebi (sp?!) aka \"crunchy fried shrimp heads with eyes\" I probably blocked this out cuz I don't like my food lookin back at me, but I ate the raw tails. Oink. ***"}
{"text":"I used to come here at least once a week with coworkers for lunch.  It was our favorite spot.  They have lunch specials and food comes out fast.  Everything is fresh and tastes great.  Come early or late because it's a small place and they get packed.  Service is always good no matter how busy they get.  I wish I still worked in the area so I could come in more often."}
{"text":"Only have 5 words for you guys ALL YOU CAN EAT MOCHI!! that was sooo gnarly and loved it so much! The service was great and FAST! The workers were nice and friendly. The parking was some what convenient but a little bit packed!
   overall it's a great place to get together with friends and family I would definitely recommend this to a friend!"}
{"text":"they added a new dining room and now sticking it to you . 5 times i went there last 1 1/2 yrs now the all you can eat 25.00 sucks . small piece of sushi fish , big barrel of rice . they watch you like a hawk too make sure you eat it . appetizers are terrible the mussels are cut in half and put in a snail dish hidden by chess ..tiny eneatable. soft shell crab is embarrassing . calamari tempura is horrible 93.00 for 2 ,ayce

{"text":"Quality AYCE. Nice selection and friendly staff. No Sashimi on the menu though. Drinks are priced decent as well. Small place and can get busy but food is fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I wish it wasn't so far, but everytime I can even think of a reason to go down to Henderson, I jump on the opportunity to go to Blue Fin. My husband and I have been here twice, and both times have had no wait, and sadly, not very many people. People are missing out by driving out and waiting for an hour for a table at Goyemon. The fish here is SO fresh and their pieces of Uni are always big, overflowing, and fresh. The fish to rice ratio is fair unlike some places where I have to take out the rice from my nigiri (and then pray I don't get charge). When my husband and I came last, we ordered a ton of nigiri and a sushi chef would always give us cuts of sashimi on the side of that fish. It was much appreciated!! 

Although my husband and I often order nigiri (our favorites are white tuna, spicy tuna, halibut, sweet shrimp, and UNI!), we also tried some of their rolls. The white tiger was very yummy and so were the fresh rolls that I don't remember, but they have some very yummy and appealing rolls on the menu. When my husband and I ate at an unnamed sushi spot last week, I looked at all the rolls and they all sounded disgusting and once again, I wished I was at Blue Fin. The service is SO fast! I love it! It seems like with a snap of a finger when you sit at the sushi bar, you will receive your food. The first time my husband and I came, we were in and out within 45 minutes because they just kept handing over our orders. The second time we took it a little slower, but were there for barely an hour. Overall, I love this place! If it was closer, it would be my go-to sushi spot. If you're ever in Henderson, definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Blue Fin Sushi & Roll is my family's go to spot when we're craving some sushi! We usually go for dinner and always do the AYCE which is $25.99 per person around that time of day. You definitely get your money's worth when you do the AYCE versus ordering à la carte.

The good thing about the AYCE option is that things like appetizers and desserts are also included in the menu whereas most AYCE joints in Vegas only include the sushi or are very limited to what you can choose from. The appetizer menu includes the usual edamame, Miso soup, shrimp tempura, and vegetable tempura. We always order a few to tie us over while waiting for our sushi, which comes out pretty quick! We've never waited long. As for the sushi... Wow! Blue Fin has a wide variety to choose from, which makes it so hard to order! Every. Single. Time. A few of our favorites include the Red Dragon, CM 4 Ever, Tiger, and the Fire Cracker which is a deep fried roll. The fish is always fresh and sliced to perfection! Each whole roll is 8 or so pieces which is definitely enough to share! (Or not) Some rolls are even available in half portions if you ask! If you have room for dessert, the tempura vanilla ice cream is a must. They also offer different flavors of mochi ice cream too!

Not only is the food great, but the customer service is quite exceptional. Each time we've had dinner here, Omar has been our server. He always takes great care of my family when we come in! The entire staff is awesome. They are constantly making sure that your order is tasting great and your empty plates are removed in a timely manner! 

Blue Fin is always on point!"}
{"text":"I've been officially rice & imitation crab bombed thanks to Scammy Mc. Scammerson. This place scams the hell out of your tastebuds, stomach space & money. We were trying to explore a new AYCE sushi spot for my fiancé's birthday dinner, but we totally regret cheating on Sakana. I'm extremely aggravated from our experience here - they seriously get no love from me.

The nigiri & rolls here are horrendous! Skip all of the nigiri if you care about your stomach. Rice city! They stuff you silly with rice denser than a rock, topped off with paper thin nigiri & an ungodly amount of imitation crab meat - what the hell!!

Plus all of the appetizers we tried were terrible. The measly soft shell crab (soft shell crap) was overwhelmed with breading and dripping in oil. The miso soup tasted like warm water. The bland baked mussels were topped with a nasty rubbery cheese, swimming in oil and presented like vomit on an escargot plate. Also, what's going on with the rock & roll? It looked nothing like any of the pictures on yelp - we were served a brick of imitation crab and a dot of tuna smaller than my pinky nail and a side of gross thick mayo (cream of sum yung gai) that tasted like artificial sweetener. Same thing with the screaming orgasm - their sweet mayo default is awful! And of course the orange salmon roll was stuffed to the max with imitation crab meat and garnished with a paper thin slice of salmon. Regrets! I have them! 

The proof is in all of the pictures I uploaded. Absolutely disgusting. I was extremely offended by every single item of food that was brought to us, all of it. We ended up having to spit out a ton of rice into about 6+ napkins and we left upset and unsatisfied.

Also to top off an awful birthday dinner in BFE, our waitress had attitude for days. I read several other reviews that mention rude service from a women here - probably the same atrocious lady. Why is she even in the service industry? Serving food?! Why!!??? I seriously can't stand this place. Get me out of here!

PRO TIP: if you care about quality AYCE sushi without all of the cheap fillers - I highly encourage trying our top spot for AYCE sushi: Sakana (on Maryland) it's like night and day compared to this place."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Blue Fin Sushi while on my way to an appointment. But to my surprise I stumbled onto a well-designed resto, clean, nice bathroom, with delicious and fresh sushi and excellent terriyaki chicken. I'll have to come back for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Fresh and inventive menu in an intimate space - just how I like my sushi.  However, I find many of their items borderline fusion.  So if you like cream cheese and truffle vinaigrette on your rolls, then this is your place. I would definitely go back for yellowtail  belly sushi.  It's not on the menu so ask if they have it.  Great service."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good atmosphere - I usually stop in here for lunch during the week and have been meaning to write a review for a while. Service is fast and I've never had any complaints about the food. My only complaint is my complete inability to do anything other than be in a food coma after doing the all you can eat for lunch!"}
{"text":"So I ate here about a year ago and I was honestly not thrilled with the experience. They slap the special sauce on everything and it is honestly just covering all the rolls. The fish had a very fishy taste to it which to me does not mean it is very good quality. 

Now I left a review on their Facebook page afterward and gave my honest opinion, that it wasn't good and I'd rather eat at another spot, Kaizen. Ok so fast forward almost a year later, I wake to see them comment on my post on their page. I figured it would be a generic comment like, \"I'm sorry you had this experience please come back and let us try again\" type deal. No! The person from Blue Fin shamed me for leaving a comment and accursed me of being a paid troll by the competition. I couldn't believe it. They touted all of their other five star reviews and that there was no way they could get a one star review. I get that a lot of people like this place which is why I went. I just so happened to have a poor experience. They clearly need to learn how to handle poor reviews better because this is not the way. Picture included."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restraunt in Las vegas. I get the ayce option every time I come and am never disappointed. The fish is always served cold and fresh. The rice to fish ratio is great. The customer service could do better but I'm here for the food."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  I have heard of this place many times from people, know the neighborhood, so finally decided to try.  It was a fun night out with friends with lots of laughter.  The service was excellent, granted it wasn't crowded at all which surprised me for a saturday night, but the entire staff was helpful and worked together well keeping our glasses full and the food coming out efficiently.  
We started with the Screaming orgasm appetizer, and the tuna poke.  The sauce on the screaming O was different but still very good, the poke came with seaweed salad and had a nice kick with flavorful spices.  
We ordered a bunch of rolls as we all got AYCE and just went family style.  From the red dragon roll, to the rock and roll, the sunset, johnny johnny, and the tokyo express were the only ones I remember someone ordering.  I didn't taste them all but the ones I did were great and flavorful and I know everyone else was happy and satisfied.  My favorite was the rock and roll as no rice and so light and refreshing.  The cucumber wasn't overwhelming the fish either.  
No five stars as the rock and roll is the only one without rice and you can only order one Screaming O and poke per AYCE.  Also compared to some other places we have all been together the dessert choices included were only average.  One of the guys even said the mochi was very dense.  
But we made it fun and enjoyed a good meal with lots of laughter.  They only have one bathroom though so be careful how much you drink as we were waiting for someone who drank too much! 
I would definitely go back as variety is great and a very positive experience"}
{"text":"Another great meal here. Favorite things are squid karage and hand rolls. Great service and food comes out quickly. Manager is nice guy and sent my friend out something he thought she might enjoy, and she did! Go eat here!"}
{"text":"As far as AYCE sushi, this place gets 5 stars from me. I'm not a fan of AYCE sushi, I was pleasantly surprised how good everything was here. Came with a group of 6 AYCE-aters one night, so we were able to sample a little bit of everything. 

Soft Shell Crab Tempura
Screaming Orgasm
Salmon Skin Salad
Calamari Tempura
Uni
Amaebi
Salmon Nigiri
Agedashi Tofu
Yellowtail Belly Nigiri
Salmon Belly Nigiri
Spicy Scallop Handroll
Salmon Skin Handroll
Tempura Ice Cream
Mochi

Out of all the sushi we had, this place did not dissapoint. Everything tasted really fresh. With our large group, and mutiple orders, the staff was very efficient. We didn't have to wait to long for our orders and my iced green tea was refilled often.

This place blows away Goyemon (which is beyond my comprehension why people dine at that dump). I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Very large extensive AYCE menu which also includes dessert!! My group and I weren't very hungry so we didn't want to tackle the AYCE menu so we ordered a la carte. However when the bill was all totaled and done we spent the same amount of money if we would have done AYCE- lesson learned. 
The Volcano roll was probably my favorite. It was lightly fried on the outside which gave it a good crunch and it was different from all the other rolls we tried that night. 
One thing that I did notice is that blue fin uses a lot more sauce than most other sushi joints- we got an Over the Rainbow roll which is your typical rainbow roll but it was served with the chef's special sauce which was plentiful and a little overpowering at times. 
Also- I didn't think the tempura ice cream was too successful. The tempura part did not cook right and was just too soggy. I've had this at other sushi restaurants with much better success. But I did enjoy the green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"Blue Fin Sushi Rocks !!  One of the Hidden Sushi Bars for Locals. I love Recommending Friends and Family. With Fresh Hawaii Big Eye Tuna Bright Red and Freshest Qualities For Sushi Bar, Blue Fin I Visit Daily and i also see Same Customers and we Agree, Blue Fin Rocks !!!   I Love Blue Fin Sushi"}
{"text":"Love bluefin every time!! Never disappoints. I have been coming here since they first opened the doors. Never go anywhere else! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"For the Green Valley & Sunset Rd area this is a good place for AYCE sushi.  Stopped in for lunch and the food continues to be good.  Everything looked and Tasted fresh. Ended lunch with their fried ice cream!  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best $25.99 I have spent. The sushi was delicious. They have a very good menu and variety of rolls plus appetizers and if you want dessert it's also on the AYCE menu. The wife isn't fond of sushi in the least but the chicken teriyaki is tender and flavorful. I usually go to Yummy on Rainbow but I was in Henderson and thought I would try this out. Glad I did. You will be as well. All the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. Our avacado roll was hard, they brought us the wrong roll and seemed to not really care about us. There was one skinny asian lady there that was really sweet so I gave 3 stars instead of 2.. the sushi wasn't that good. Mochi was good. I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch pick-up due to short window in which I needed to return back to work. First time going, but have passed the place many times before. Accommodating gentleman at the door took my order at the door. Ordered a spicy salmon roll, and added some extras to it. No problem! Then the gentleman suggested the current special witch doubled my order for only $3 more...sold! I went to truck for maybe 5min and returned to my order ready and bagged. Now that's what I'm talking about! Got to work and had a great lunch, plus I made it back in time!"}
{"text":"Best in Vegas for AYCE and best in Vegas period if you go omakase. Ive been to SEN of Japan, Osaka (Henderson) which I will say are the only other excellent sushi restaurants in Vegas. Blue Fin is best value for your money and the chef is the most creative in town. Ask for something a little different he blow your mind! If you go anywhere else you are wasting your $$."}
{"text":"I am I BIG sushi fan and this is so far one of the best places to go for amazing sushi. Why the four stars though? Well, sometimes we would get sushi that we didn't even order and then the table next to you got that sushi. For example, you ordered a California roll, the other table ordered a 007. The waiter comes back with the 007 for you. What I would recommend for the waiters is maybe put numbers on the table to help memorize which sushi belongs to which table. Back to the sushi, one word: Amazing! We had the all you can eat and we had nine rolls of sushi. Those rolls were 3 California rolls, Tuna, Spider, 007, Royal California, Sweetheart (I think that's what it was called), and and another roll (I forgot what it was called). So, my favorite out of all those rolls is a tie to 007 and Spider. But if I could only eat one, it would be the Spider roll. That's how delicious it was. I would totally come back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, friendly atmosphere. I come here fairly regularly. The all-you-can-eat is new-ish but amazing. 
The lunch special is pretty incredible. 2 rolls, miso soup, big salad, edamame, and and orange for dessert. All for under $10!
The place is small and quaint. It doesn't take long before they start to recognize you :)"}
{"text":"It's easy to miss the sign for this neighborhood sushi joint on Sunset.  In fact, the first time we ate here, it was after we passed the place 5 times because we mistook Blue Fin for Checkers, which is located next door.  I am so glad we drove by that 6th time!! 

While there is certainly an ACYE option, which looks great, my man and I trust Jin, sushi-chef extraordinaire and proprietor, to surprise us every time we eat at this fine establishment.  To his credit, he never disappoints... and surprise he certainly does! His handroll creations (his spicy yellowtail with special sauce and shiso-tuna handrolls are our favs) are excellent.  But, his take on a sashimi salad (one specially named for me) takes the cake.  I'm admittedly biased - wouldn't you be if you had a salad named after you?  But, then again, you can't be all that biased when this particular sashimi salad is made up of a spicy tuna poke nestled in fresh greeens, a medley of generous cuts of salmon, tuna, yellowtail (and whatever other fresh fish is at his disposal that day), and a dash of truffle-oil! We are also big fans of his cajun albacore sashimi, which is spiced to perfection, and his signature Blue Fin roll (it's the cilantro flavoring that gives this roll its extra boost).

The staff at Blue Fin is friendly and extremely family-oriented.  In fact,  Jin and his lovely wife, Yura, often work side-by-side to ensure a great resto experience.  The rest of the staff is also pleasant and always aim to please.

My only tip for improvement: get a bigger sign so that more people can discover your wonderful restaurant!!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat for $25 a person. You must try the Blue Fin Special.

I came here for a UYE and Blue Fin's anniversary for some sushi and karaoke.  The place is very cozy and probably seats no more than 50 people, so be prepared to sit elbow to elbow if you're in a big group or be prepared for it to get loud when it's busy. I loved their nigiri selection, and the specialty rolls.  

Overall I had a great evening , had great sushi and sang a few tunes of karaoke.  Will definitely be on my top sushi spots to hit up again!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place about 5 years ago & it became my favorite sushi spot ever since. I was tired of Yama Sushi, which is great but I was just over it, so I was glad to find this place.

I introduced my boyfriend to sushi at this place & well, it's been our favorite! The rolls are awesome, food is always fresh & my boyfriend's personal favorite is that our gyoza is always super crispy! The only reason I don't give it 5 Stars is because we've never had consistent amazing service. Sometimes we have to wait up to 10 minutes after finishing a roll to have someone even glance at our table unless we call a server over. So the service is hit or miss, never a rude employee just not as attentive to us. But the food is great & I love that the place is usually never super packed, at least in my experience.

Favorite rolls: Crazy Yum Yum, Gangman Style, Golden Tiger, Royal Shrimp But the whole menu is delicious!!!! Also, must try the gyoza & their nigiri is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Very good service, great people and food. Nice to hit up a sushi place and feel welcomed. Will be back for sure. Spicy albacore and spicy tuna were great. Poke is great with a little spice.
This place is well worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is just ok I prolly won't go back the poki salad fish was cut too thick and the fish wasn't fresh"}
{"text":"Ordered from the ala carte menu -Beef teriyaki combo, and 3 rolls. Also wanted to try the tempura ice cream, eck! Fail! Food was ok but the service needs improvement. Waiters kept on forgetting what we asked for and never got back to us (place wasn't even busy)."}
{"text":"I write this as an outsider: a Californian looking for a place to eat in Vegas. When I saw a Yelp rating of 4.5 stars for this place, I bookmarked it as a possible visit. This is my review...

My girlfriend and I arrived here on a Saturday. Plenty of parking spaces available, parked right by the door. Inside was pretty much the same. The sushi bar was full, but there were plenty of table seating.

The decor has some elements that make me presume that this was once a small French bistro. The doors for the individual male and female restrooms have characters wearing berets. An outdoor patio has some decorative lamps that certainly isn't Japanese inspired.

Seeing as how there's a 1 hour time limit, we set our timers at 12:30pm. We probably stayed a slight but longer than that, and they weren't strict about kicking us out.

The target audience of this restaurant is aimed more towards local Las Vegans than tourists. There are some good things to be said about selecting this place over casino buffets. All you can eat sushi. Certainly cheaper. No fighting for parking. Friendly service (our waitress was always around). Clean facilities. No waiting in line. No gasping for air because of smokers.

BUT... it is far from the Strip. While the cuts of the fish look aesthetically appealing, the quality of the fish is spotty: some great (yellowtail), others okay (super white tuna, tobiko, masago), others not (salmon, ikura, shrimp).

There were a few items that weren't included on the lunch menu, such as uni, sweet shrimp, and something called the \"Screaming Orgasm\". I mainly don't go for the specialty rolls, so I can't really speak out for those. I did order the One item that stood out for me was the crab meat sushi. Mmmm, that's not something you normally see. Wished those were more common.

Lunch is $21.99 and dinner is $25.99. Decent price. Noted on the menu is a charge if you leave leftovers.

Service is good, as our waitress kept coming back. One sign of good service is never having to ask for your own refill, and she certainly was attentive to keep checking our table. Which isn't hard since we were pretty much the only occupied table. Not that I'm complaining, just making an observation.

Dessert items are also included with the sushi gorging, which includes several variations of mochi and ice cream. As we got our bill, we were also served with orange topped with plum juice. 

That being said, the place isn't bad at all. I ate my fill and then some. But speaking as an out-of-state visitor, it might be worth the trip if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this AYCE.  Great ahi poke salad and desserts.  Wow on everything plus great service to boot! We will be back!!! Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Blue Fin Sushi & Roll is literally in the middle of nowhere in Las Vegas (definitely a trek off strip). We made the trip for their AYCE sushi lunch.

For about $20 you get an hour of AYCE sushi, which includes rolls, sushi nigiri, appetizers, and dessert. The only limitations were that a few pieces of fish are not offered during the lunch hour. Rolls can be requested to be made as half rolls, except for fried ones. Options for appetizers include edmamme, fried tofu and miso soup. Dessert options included oranges, ice cream, mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream!!

The cucumber salad was just ok, but the boyfriend loved the crab meat on top! The seaweed salad was over dressed. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)

Pass on the fried tofu, they texture is not the silky kind and they literally fry a large piece of tofu rather than two or three small pieces. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)

The salmon tasted funny (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)

The garlic tuna was amazing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)

Baked green mussels were rich, pass on it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)

They have patio seating, but let's be real it's always too hot in Vegas to sit outdoors ;) 

Blue Fin Sushi & Roll is probably a great place for locals who work around that area, but not worth a special trip off strip if you are just visiting."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants i ever been to i just love the cali crunch roll it was the best good job guys"}
{"text":"We like Blue Fin a lot. We found it when our last go to place started ending up in the restaurant report for violations.  Word to the wise: foodborne illnesses from seafood can mess you up. Just say'in. Happy to say we've been going here for years and it's all good. The fish is always fresh and they keep the AYCE orders flowing. I saw a review where the lady complained that the fish was sliced too thin but that wasn't my experience.  It all looked great, see my pictures. TIP: when we go to eat sushi we order accordingly : if you like the fish (hubby) get nigiri or hand rolls. If you're new to sushi start with the cooked rolls. If you like it mixed with all sorts of stuff (me), get the rolls. Whatever you like they have it. They do have some of the traditional Japanese dishes like teriyaki (for your newbie friends who are afraid of sushi) but make no mistake, sushi's the star here. Blue Fin's menu may not be as extensive as other places but what they do, they do well."}
{"text":"I was truly hoping to fall inlove with this place because it is so close to my house.. 

I ordered thru postmates for delivery which I was happy with.. however the food itself was a total let down.

not including delivery I paid $35 for 3 things.. Not super worth it."}
{"text":"Oh Blue Fin, what can I say about you? Lisa L takes me here, oh about every other day. Best sushi I've ever had. We usually do the AYCE option, priced at $26. Each time I go I've had a mix of pieces, handrolls, and the full rolls. Alaskan and Arizona are 2 of my favorites. All of the fish is really fresh, and Jin always throws in some bonus thing for us, usually not even on the menu. Blue Fin just passed its two year anniversary. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"In town on business, found good reviews on Yelp.  Ordered the chefs 'A'.  Was not disappointed!! Starters with a bowl of edamame.  Miso soup and a small salad next. Dressing on the salad was tangy and crisp!  
6 piece spicy tuna roll. Tuna was fresh and fatty.  Excellent.  Then a 9 pieces of sashimi.  Not sure what they all were, but they were great!"}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the sushi here.  It is nice to stop at a place and have AYCE with heavy portions and happy employees.  I will definitely stop in again when I am nearby."}
{"text":"I eat sushi OFTEN!! The service is outstanding. I tipped the guy. 20 I thought it was so good. The all you can Is the entire menu!! 

I would give it a 5 the only reason I didn't Is that the sushi isn't as fresh as I would of liked.  Everything was still very good, I just thought the product could of been a notch up. However it's a small little place and they do the best they can"}
{"text":"I come here twice a month . The staff is wonderful and the SUSHI is the best. I usually get the all you can eat lunch/dinner. The place is limited seating and is usually full. I love the Grand Canyon, Wet Dream and the green tea or Vanilla fried ice cream . I always leave full and happy that is why I come as Often as I can ."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. I always sit at the sushi bar so I can talk to the chef's and get my food quickly. They do not overload the sushi with rice like many other AYCE places do. A meal+ a beverage run about $30 a person before tip so it is not something I can get as often as I would like. I stick to the sushi because I can watch the chef's make it, although I am sure the stuff that comes from the back is decent. It is a small place and is usually full until 8pm or so."}
{"text":"Love this place! Would give 10 stars if possible. All the food is delish, serving sizes are good, staff is great."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place to eat. I really love Japanese lasagna rolls and they have perfected that. I loved their baked rolls as well however they are too filling. If you are going to get AYCE don't load up on al the baked rolls because the tempura will fill you up. They are also fairly huge in size for a roll. Although they only give you five pieces for certain baked rolls they fill you up in an instant. They do this really cute thing with their orange. Ask for a sliced orange and their presentation of that is really cute :)"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and it wasn't super busy which was nice. I read some reviews that were complaining about price and the sushi... I personally thought it was a good value, they have a lot of yummy rolls and the fish was very fresh. I will be eating here more often for sure."}
{"text":"Yelp, you have failed me!  I had such great hopes before visiting -- from all of the 4 and 5 star reviews and from the consistent Sushi threads in the talk forum.

I think what happens is that the trend reviews really skews reviewer's perception.  Either that or I just went on an off day.

In regards to overall atmosphere, appearance, quality of food, and variety, Blue Fin doesn't come anywhere close to Goyemon.   This is coming from someone who believes that Goyemon has been on the decline of late.

I left Blue Fin full, feeling sick, and wanting my money back.  What the hell is in the sauce on your eel and rolls.  Do they put cornstarch in there to thicken it?  The Udon soup tasted foul as well.  The fry they use in their soft shell crab and agadashi tofu was definitely not japanese.  

The only saving grace of this place was their salmon skin salad which was delicious.  Still, there is no reason for me to come back.   There's probably 100 sushi AYCE places in Vegas and I would rate Blue Fin as average."}
{"text":"Lunch was great. Restaurant is clean and spacious. Menú is clear. Service was quick. And food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp and decided to give this place a try on our vacation to Vegas and let me say that this place didn't disappoint. The all you can eat menu was great. We all left stuffed and happy. The service was also very quick. The only thing that was not good was the tuna garlic nigiri. The fish eggs were delicious though! Over all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"The best Sushi ever & that's hard to believe since in the middle of the desert!
They have Fried Chicken thats also a must.
They even have bombay steaks
If your in town it's a must if your a fan of Sushi."}
{"text":"My Dad & I had lunch here on Father's Day and we loved this place. It was cozy and clean, everyone was friendly. they even made my dad's his own specialty roll he basically told the sushi chef what ingredients he wanted in it and he made it for him right away with no problem at all. I will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at Blue Fin Sushi. Our server was awesome and so friendly, and even with our large party, she managed to serve us with no problems. I don't know whose brilliant idea it was, but the server brought everyone at our table a complimentary appetizer created by the chef. The appetizer was a mix of rice, tuna & seaweed slivers all mixed together with a drizzle of truffle oil and some other seasonings. It was yummy. 

I ordered the Sushi Special Combo- 7 pcs Sushi- Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Albacore, Eel, Shrimp, White Fish with California or Spicy Tuna roll and miso soup and house salad. I opted for the Spicy Tuna roll. I never got my miso soup, but I didn't mind because the complimentary appetizer was far better. The sushi, itself, was okay. The fish tasted fresh, but I didn't really find the rice to be good. I've had better sushi elsewhere. 

For the sushi alone, I would give three stars, but the friendly service and special appetizer bumped this review up to 4 stars. Also, the rolls looked tasty.I would definitely come back to Blue Fin Sushi, just not for nigiri sushi."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I secretly fantasize about Blue Fin every single day. This place floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee! This was my first REAL sushi experience because I always thought I was allergic so needless to say I was terrified! I was really nervous that I wasn't going to enjoy it and insult the chef by spitting it out or choking it down (You dirty birds).  Quite the opposite happened. Not only was it completely tolerable, but I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! 

We did the AYCE and I don't recall everything I tried, but here are some of the highlights: 

Ahi Tuna Salad- This was the first thing I tried and was surprised by the delicate texture of the tuna combined with the crisp cucumber. Off to a good start. 

Rock n Roll- My favorite roll there probably because it had some sort of mayo on it and rice which are both on my cheat list usually. It was all wrapped in cucumber. If I wasn't dieting I would have ordered more. This is the roll I fantasize about the most. 

Spider Roll- Crunchy goodness. Nuff said. 

Teriyaki Chicken- Hands down the best I've had. It was so moist and not overwhelmingly sweet or greasy. What a perfect option for those non-sushi eaters(FYI- You are on the wrong team!) 

Lastly the sashimi.....OMG. The chef sent this over special for us because I was with one of us that eats here often. It was yellowtail simply drizzled with truffle oil and melted like butter on my tongue and that's when Blue Fin and I had a moment..... Up until then everyone at the table was watching the nonfish girl eat fish and I was trying to be graceful about the chewing, etc. . Not now. I wanted to eat it with my hands like Animal from the Muppets. Animal like sushi!!!! Being the lady I am, I contained the inner Animal, but it was still apparent to the table that this was my favorite. Probably the drooling noises gave me away. 

All of the fish was so fresh and the presentation showed the pride they put in to each dish. Five star experience from start to finish and I highly recommend it to everyone I know and don't know. Thank you Blue Fin and Willis for turning me into a huge sushi fan!!!"}
{"text":"Service was 10/10 and the price is reasonable. My only complaint is the \"chef's special sauce\". The rolls that contain this sauce just tastes like it was drenched in soy sauce.

You can see in the picture that the roll is drenched in this sauce. Disappointing as this roll is their signature roll."}
{"text":"Our family loves sushi, we have tried many places. I am not a fan of AYCE usually because I find the rolls are never as good or fresh as places that do not offer that option. This place is the exception!!! AYCE is Excellent here!! Best part, you can order half rolls 3-4 big pieces so your able to try a lot. Delicious rolls, fair prices especially at lunch, fresh, cold sushi w/ wonderful flavors, good service. I took my 17yr old son who AYCE is great for. A romantic date, probably not my first choice. It was clean & had a comfortable casual feel."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dropped in here last night after receiving the rudest service we've ever had  at the The Olive restaurant across the street (more on that in my profile if you'd like specifics). Let's just say that this place was a breath of fresh air from the moment we walked through the door and were greeted by a very wonderful, friendly hostess. 

We've never been here and everything on the menu looked wonderful so we asked the sushi chef what he recommended. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, as well as what fish was freshest, and was able to recommend two rolls that we LOVED: Their signature Blue Fin roll and the Wet Dream. Of the two, I liked the latter better. It was like a creamy party in my mouth! We also had a Yellow tail Hand Roll and some Ikura, both of which were very tasty as well. 

The service and food were top notch and we will definitely be returning for some AYCE soon!"}
{"text":"This is my sushi spot! Clean venue! Amazing staff! My husband and I have been here over a dozen times and their food is consistently the best! Please try their volcano roll!"}
{"text":"To quickly summarize, staff is impatient and mediocre food. 

I absolutely love naked fish sushi bar but it's on the other side of town so I've been desperately trying to find a place that can come close. I always drive passed this place so I figured I'd give it a shot, definitely regret walking in. A few things:

-it was freezing inside
-the tap water had a weird taste. Maybe it was the glasses? Stil, yuck.
-Service: ok once you ordered but until them they stare at you and constantly come over to see if you're ready. Note, their menu is HUGE. It took me almost 10 mins to look thru the menu. 
-menu caters to AYCE ($26 dinner) because the prices are so high. All rolls are over $11. You can half certain rolls btw.
-rainbow roll: unfortunately I halfed this roll, it was the better of the two rolls I tasted but was nothing special.
-happy ending: far from it! Weird flavor combo. A vamped up Philadelphia roll with lemon slices and garlic ponzu sauce. It was mainly a garlic and lemon roll since they over powered the rest of the roll and left a bad taste in the mouth. 

I was not impressed unfortunately. With all the great reviews, my hopes were high."}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to like this place. It's so close to home and had such good reviews. Why does it have such good reviews?! The fish tasted so old and the rice tasted stale! Super white and garlic tuna are my favorites. I should NOT have to chew the super white as much as I did there. And the rolls... Like I said, the fish tasted old and the rice was just dry and gross. So what they do, is they over saturated their rolls with way too much sauce. The rolls were so soggy, I literally gagged a couple of times. I've just been so spoiled with knowing some of the best spots in town, that this place just extra disappointed me. Please don't waste your money here. It really is that bad. Premade store bought rolls are better. Only getting a 2, because the servers were pretty good."}
{"text":"Super cheap sushi, rolls and all kinds of food. Always clean and always great sushi! The sushi bar is awesome and their tv is a great size to watch the game on while eating. Definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. I always get 2 sushi rolls (spicy tuna and a crunch), small salad and soup for under $10. Service is fast. The salad is great... real lettuce (not pointless iceberg) string candied beets, and the dressing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good if you ask me... I've driven by several times and always wanted to eat here. 

Well we went in on a Friday afternoon and were the only ones in there... Maybe it was just a slow day, but from reading all the reviews I was kinda shocked that it was dead in there haha. Anyways, the sushi tasted really good and so did the fish... We got ayce and I can't really tell you exactly which rolls I got, but I wasn't a fan of the one wrapped in cucumber instead of the usual... Also wayyyyy too much sauce on it.... It kinda looked like milk all over haha... every other roll was good though so no big deal...

They are very friendly and attentive here, which if you read my other reviews, is a major thing with me. I think the only reason why I took a star off was bc the edamame we ordered seemed old and not very fresh and their low-sodium soy sauce tasted like they had normal soy sauce and added water to it to dilute it...I could be crazy but just tasted odd. Other than that it was great! I'll probably go here again whenever I'm on this side of town. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic staff, always consistent,  highly recommend all you can eat."}
{"text":"I am not sure why it took me so long to review this place, but here goes. The all you can eat sushi is really a treat, huge variety and everything is fresh and well prepared. Service for lunch or dinner is always prompt, but it can be a bit too much service if that makes any sense. Tonight we came in around 7pm and it was not very busy, just a few other patrons having dinner. We were seated right away, served right away and finished plates were removed from the table within seconds of taking the last piece! Super service to the max. Sushi is always fresh, (although we did have one occasion where we both got a bit of Motezuma's revenge, but we will overlook that somehow). Yeah, I know, but no one is perfect and we won't hold a grudge.
There lunch specials are just right in portion and the price is about the 10 dollar mark, which is really good for a decent sushi lunch with soup, salad and 2 rolls that come out on a sushi boat dish.
The place used to be tiny with just a few tables, but now they can handle a good size group if they have to and  often there are some large parties being served. Overall, minus a star for the overly eager service and the non traditional music they play gets a little distracting and does not really fit the decore or atmosphere for dinner. The all you can eat is a grear value and I am sure some big eaters can really do some \"damage\". The place is really popular and for good reason, we like it and have been dining here for a few years now."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I feel like eating sushi. I love the volcano roll and the yura roll is my favorite. Is the iced green tea is great as well."}
{"text":"We vacation here all the way from idaho a couple of times a year. We stumbled across this place and it was amazing.  We have been alot of places and tried sushi all over. This is the best sushi we've ever had, not to mention the staff was very friendly and helpful by recommending rolls based on our preference. I highly recommend the western special, wet dream, and the blue fin special.  Not one of the rolls that we ordered was bad. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I never did think that I'd be able to replace my favorite sushi restaurant (Sin City Sushi), but, it has happened. Well, sorta. 

I cannot completely write off Sin City, because once you have Young's garlic sauce, or his mussels, you will seriously crave them for days after... but, Blue Fin executes all their dishes delightfully well.

Jin, the owner (I believe) is from Hawaii. The first night I went with my boyfriend, it was a quiet Sunday night. We were served by a young woman who was also from Hawaii. Service was fast, friendly, and extremely patient!  Blue Fin has an exceptional selection of rolls, appetizers and nigiri.

My boyfriend and I usually get a lot of nigiri, and that night was no different. We had garlic tuna, hamachi, ika (with salt and lemon), amaebi, cajun albacore, tako, and a bunch more.

Great fish to rice ratio, and the few rolls that we did try were a good size (*PLUS, they do half rolls!*) 

They have awesome appetizers. I love mussels, but the mussels here are a little different from everywhere else. So just be aware that when ordering mussels here, they are already off the shell, and come in a special dish. We also had their tuna crab cake, salmon skin salad, and \"poki\" ( i always spelled it poke.. hmm)

All came with shredded beet and carrot toppings. I don't like beets AT ALL, regardless of what Dr. Oz says about the nutritional value they possess, it detracted from what would have been all together delicious, again, my own personal opinion.

Anyway, the restaurant setting and my overall experience here leads me to conclude that this restaurant is a solid 4 stars. Their quality of fish is on the higher end as compared with some other popular names in the AYCE sushi world.

Will go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is my families favorite place for Sushi, fresh and taste is great! Clean and great service. Friendly and attentive staff.  All you can eat.  We start with baked mussels and the PokiTuna salad. There rolls are all delicious. Atmosphere is relaxing.  We go at least twice a month. Dragon roll is our favorite."}
{"text":"I love coming here . The food and service is always great . Even if it's jam packed the service is prompt. Rolls are delicious and I love the lasagna rolls ! Most I've had to wait to be seated was about 15 minutes and that's when it was busy. The staff is very nice and courteous. I always tip them well because of it . It's family friendly ! Took the toddlers here the other day and it was a success, the staff even acknowledged the children very well and respectfully . Will keep coming here !"}
{"text":"After calling the other popular ayce sushi place and finding out that it was a 2 hour wait on a Friday night,  we decided to come here instead.  The wait was only 20 min.   Although the price was a $1 more and the selection was a bit limited,  it was perfectly fine for us.   We were hungry and my in laws would never wait that long just to eat.   The service is fast and they don't take forever to bring out the food.  Rice to sushi ratio was fair and everything we tried was quite decent.   We would come back here again after enjoying our dinner without the long ridiculous wait time.   Hopefully this place doesn't get crazy busy likr the other places that serves ayce!"}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE sushi. The place is very small however and we went on a cold night so sitting outside was not an option. I don't eat raw fish much but the cooked rolls were delish! I would go back again!"}
{"text":"This place deserves all stars. I've been eating AYCE sushi here for a few years now for all sorts of occasions and it never fails! Courteous service, fresh ingredients.100% painless. Our go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious place got to try it ! Sushi is bomb Katsura chicken pretty good my favorite is the mochi !! And if u don't know what that is u better come and try it"}
{"text":"This is my first favorite sushi place since we moved to Vegas. One of my favorite rolls us a blue fin special roll. It has the right amount of spice to it and does not overwhelm your taste buds. 


So far this is my place to go for sushi."}
{"text":"4 star sushi 
3 star customer service 
1 star restaurant policy 

If u do AYCE 

Whatever you fail to finish eating the charge you for on top of the 25.00 ...... 

That's ridiculous . Period"}
{"text":"the VOLCANO roll is my new favorite roll - great service, excellent food, extensive menu,"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Good place to go for A.Y.C.E., Fresh fish and great appetizers. Only reason I didn't gice 5 starts is because the service was a little on the slow side. They seemed to be under staffed that night but we're handling it very well!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 star review.

Finally, we tried the AYCE at Blue Fin, after all the talks about how amazing this AYCE is.  The uni nigiri was fresh, which is a good sign.  Afterward, we ordered orders of hamachi, amaebi, saba, salmon, and many more.  We decided that mackerel was our favorite so there came 4 more orders of them.  The amaebi wasn't as big and sweet/fresh as we have wanted to, but was decent.  

For dessert, I ordered all flavors available for the mochi, and tried out the red bean icecream.  I do like the fact that you can order how ever many dessert you want.  Service was really good.  Will I be coming back to Blue Fin?  It was decent, but I will go to Goyemon."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday with my boyfriend. We got seated immediately, our sever was very attentive, and there was a great selection of sushi on the menu. The sever was able to give suggestions to our preference and our rolls came out very quickly. I'm a huge sushi fan so I definitely will be adding this spot to my regular places. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat sushi and it was pretty good. I didn't enjoy the service at all! The waitress was irritated taking our order and irritated that we sat and talked after we were done with our meal. I would understand if the place was busy but it was completely empty! 

Service is everything for me and this place clearly misses the mark."}
{"text":"My other sushi spot was  crowded and I was hungry so I decided to drive to Blue Fin. Not very crowded on a Friday night so we took a seat at the sushi bar. The staff was on point, we never had to wait when ordering a roll. They even accommodated us to where my wife didn't like some of the items in a roll and they made it how we wanted it. Each roll I had was flavorful and fresh. I tried mochi for the first time, coffee flavored and found it to be an excellent end to the meal."}
{"text":"Lowering my rating to 1 star solely because of the service we got from Jin's IGNORANT wife.

My wife and I were the ONLY ONES there for lunch

We did AYCE as usual, did some nigiri, tried specials, tried different rolls, and we enjoyed the Chirashi(off the menu) so much, from attending Lisa L's UYE, we asked if we could order it...Jin wasn't there, but the other chef, Ynot was. we showed him the picture told him about the Yelp event,etc. so he checked with Jin's wife if it was possible.

This is what she said:

\"Oh, this takes longer to prepare and this is for VIP people only.\"
I couldn't help but mumble to my wife, \"F--K ME, I guess we're not considered VIP\".

We were willing to pay
we were willing to wait
WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE

Chef Ynot sensed that we were pissed and disgusted, our orders stopped, and we just couldn't believe she had the nerve to say what she said...SERVICE IS PART OF THE DINING EXPERIENCE!

immediately chef Ynot made a roll on the fly and named it the Sylvia 
Roll. Thanks, but too little too late. As a business owner, every customer should be treated as a \"VIP\"

We finished the roll, thanked Chef Ynot and walked right out the door.
Thats the last time we'll ever go there....Thank goodness for Wayne's, Sushi Mon, and Sin City, Places where we're ALWAYS treated like VIPS....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi staff is well trained and the fish is great...especially for the price.  The tako and uni with quail egg are my favorites.  Well done chefs!"}
{"text":"WOW just super incredible!

Went late and they were open, not many people in here but then again it was around 9:30pm

Seated at the bar because that is the best place after all...

Greeted Politely by the chefs Kyle and Kevin, Explained our first time here and then my son and I were asked what we liked and did not like....The chefs went to work and let me tell you every single thing the chefs gave us were just incredible!

I found my newest Sushi hangout...You will not be disappointed in Blue Fin Fresh ingredients ... Does NOT smell of Fish...First sign of a good Sushi house.

The Salmon Skin Hand Roll was the BOMB...

When They say AYCE they mean it!..My son had one of every desert lol

Thanks again Kevin and Kyle My son and I will be back often"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place! My only go to! Their sushi is actually fresh and well prepared and it's in whole places unlike other places who dice it up to hide the less fresh pieces. And their rice to fish ratio is always perfect. Super clean and awesome service. The only place I ever go now for sushi."}
{"text":"Today was my second time going to this sushi restaurant and it was just as good as the last time. I contemplated doing the AYCE ($27.00 for dinner) but decided that I wasn't hungry enough to eat AYCE. I was so glad that I opted out of ding AYCE because they serve huge rolls. Each roll I got was bigger than any I have ever gotten anywhere else. By the time I was done with my second roll I was stuffed! My only complaint is that their cream cheese tasted a bit odd none the less the sushi was overall really good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Royal shrimp is so yummy my new favorite sushi place they have large combos will definitely come back here with more people great environment and excellent staff"}
{"text":"This is so sad for me to do.  I have been coming to blue fin since 2010.  It is the first place my son ate sushi.  It has a place in my heart.  The quality is still quite good but the service has gone from bad to terrible.  It takes forever to even see your wait staff.  Orders take forever if they are even put in.  40 minutes 5 items ordered and only 2 received.  On top of that we had to order the items twice.  This is depressing."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. The Johnny Johnny roll stands out--mild spicy soft shell crab inside, tuna, avocado and special sauce outside. They will serve half rolls during all you can eat. The rice is exceptional--a little more sweet than I am used to, but exceptional. Stellar cuts of fish for the nigiri! My husband's favorite was probably the Cajun Lover. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a couple times with the bf for lunch and its pretty good sushi. We get the two roll lunch special you get miso soup and a house salad and two rolls. I got the crunch roll and the California roll both were very good the portions are perfect just enough to fill you up but not over stuff you. The food is good quality and the service is excellent I cant wait to come here for dinner they have several specialty rolls that I wanna try. Oh and the prices are very reasonable the lunch special is only $8.95. If you haven't tried this place please do you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love Blue Fin!  The fish is grubbin' and the staff is very nice and accommodating.  I usually like to stop in after class for the dinner time eats and have come a few times during lunch to chow down.  Although I'm usually a fan of baked mussels, I'm not a fan of the one they serve here.  Like Chris V. said, it's more a lasagna/pizza approach when I'm used to the sparingly sauced types of baked mussels out in the valley.  Other than that, Blue Fin does stellar and continually warrants repeated visits from time to time.  Try out the Mexican roll and the Hawaiian roll.. both of my favs.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Sushi. The staff is always wonderful. The food is great. It's hard to pick a favorite roll, they are all tasty. There us something for everyone here! The lunch specials are very reasonable, as is their All-You-Can-Eat specials. Fast and friendly service, great food... it's our family's favorite!"}
{"text":"So gross. I never had anything more disgusting, baked muscles just drenched in cheese, soggy sushi , nigiri super thin and chewy. Very bad. Service is not that great."}
{"text":"AYCE here is definitely a bang for your buck here! Every time I stop by to eat here, I always get AYCE. Their staff is amazing. They're all so very nice and attentive. A local, small business and gets their fish shipped in daily to ensure you get the freshest of the fresh fish we could get (say that three times).

My fave:

YELLOWTAIL COLLAR: Super fatty full of flavor, slightly sweet with a smokey taste. All yellow tail and barely any collar bone.

SPICY POKE SALAD: sssooo good, refreshing, and light with slight kick to it. If you are looking for a light meal for lunch or dinner to pick at ala carte. This would be a fine choice (that is if you're choosing between the seaweed salad and the poke salad)

SUSHI FAVES: Rainbow Roll, Caterpillar, Volcano, Fire Cracker, and Over the Rainbow.

Kyle was such an amazing company the first time I came, and our waitresses (both times I came) were marvelous. The first time, Kyle took us to a different sushi journey and whipped up a concoction of his own. I wish I could remember what he named it, but you can request for his signature dish. Kyle also gave us some of his famous \"secret lychee ice cream\" which unfortunately no longer a secret (sorry Kyle!). I asked for some the second time and it was nice of the waitress to check. Unfortunately, they were out of it (figures...).

Always one of my faves."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been in Vegas, I time my workouts in the morning so I can have the lunch AYCE at Blue Fin. Unlike Sumo, you can order the sashimi appetizers like the ahi poke salad at lunch. Such a great deal and super tasty. All of the specialty rolls I have tried are packed full of fresh fish and not giant rice balls designed to fill you up. And any nigiri you order seems to come to you immediately.

Garlic tuna nigiri is especially tasty, and their spicy hand rolls are fantastic. Can't wait to go back in June!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and had the all you can eat lunch. Other then a few dinner items, nothing was off limits. It was good. I will be back if I am in that area."}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy, even with reservation we had to wait. 

Of course ordered all you can eat, its the only way to eat sushi. It was pretty good just slow coming food and the sushi all came before our appetizers.

No, seriously our miso soup arrived last. We also needed a fork for a child and we asked 4 servers before one of them finally came back with it.

Flavors are good and as many servers stop by the table there seems to be some miscommunication between them and our order."}
{"text":"Could have been better. Sushi was as good as anywhere. Staff not welcoming or friendly. I got the vibe we were a pain not a pleasure."}
{"text":"Their service was very good! I went in at 3 pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't packed and our food was served to us really quickly.   Overall food was delicious and service was great! If you love sushi their AYCE is the way to go! Would recommend this place I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars cause I'm happy every time I'm here, and in comparison to other sushi places in the area, it's better."}
{"text":"Good ayce place!! Sushi came out a little bit slow and the server forgot our order a couple of time that's why the review is lower, but the rolls are very good! The beer tasted good too  but a go if you are feeling up to an ayce sushi place"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Wet dream roll is one of personal favorites but they have so many more good ones to try. We always leave happy and stuffed. Seating is comfortable.This place is a must try. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my older go to sushi places.. 
used to be obsessed but over time my favorite place degraded and I had to upgrade to sushi Kaya or Kaizen. Overall if you're in a bit of a hurry and are looking to eat a quick AYCE . This is the place to go"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of sushi, and this was just an okay joint. Their screaming o leaves a lot to be desired...needless to say not much screaming went on. 

Their hand rolls were great, and decently priced. I got a salmon hand roll and a natto hand roll. There was no wait, and service was almost....too good. For example, I pick up the natto hand roll off the plate I'm eating and take a bite, and as I'm taking a bite one of the busboys (of which there were three hovering over the dining area like buzzards over a body) swoops in a grabs the plate. I'm clearly eating off of it, but don't even have time to object as I just took a huge bite.

I will try this place again, as it wasn't overpriced at all. We got two hand rolls, the blue fin special roll, and a screaming orgasm, and the bill came to about 34 bucks. Was enough to fill up the two of us."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay. Service is okay. Nothing special. Salads are good, especially the dressing. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi places I have tried. I walked in and I was the only person there. I should have walked out after the smell of sewer hit my nose, but I did not want to be rude. The shrimp was flat...FLAT and there was lemon juice drizzled on it, probably to hide the lack of freshness. The staff was very good. The service was not bad. I am not sure why so many local sushi places feel the need to blare hip-hop. Sushi is supposed to be relaxing and social. I cannot see myself returning"}
{"text":"Bluefin is one my top ten sushi spots in Las Vegas. 

Although their AYCE menu isn't as good as other places in Chinatown, they are conveniently located near my school in Henderson so I can't complain. I love how their sushi is really fresh and thick. Although the rice to sushi ratio isn't the best (because let's be real, we all prefer more fish and less rice) the quality of fish is worth it.

Plus, they have an affordable lunch special menu that include a miso soup and chef salad with all the dishes. I always order the Sashimi Special Combo for 15.95. It is a 10 piece sashimi dish that includes: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, shrimp, white fish, miso soup, and house salad."}
{"text":"We didn't have a lot of time to eat before a movie we were going to see so we stopped here for some quick sushi. We shared AYCE, the sushi was some of the best I've had in Las Vegas and the service was excellent. The server was attentive and the chefs were fast. My new favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been all over the world eating sushi. The service was average. The food was priced well. Didn't expect an all you can eat to be good but it was. We had a varied amour of nigiri and sushi. I ordered miso soup and it never came. There was empty tables all around at lunch on a Friday. We we sat by the door at the window and would expect to be in the heart of the restaurant. If your new to sushi or not a picky sushi eater this would be good especially if you eat a lot and do all you can eat. If your very picky on service then probably best to skip. The fish was fresh and the story I was told about the owner having several of these restaurants is probably the reason. I've found really good authentic Japanese restaurants have a few things. A Japanese name, packed seating, Japanese eating there. It's also good if the chef is native Japanese as there is honor in their culture with fresh fish which is not always inexpensive. So I say go if your a family and want good food on a good budget and not picky on service."}
{"text":"I actually came here expecting a not so good experience from reading previous lunch time reviews but surprisingly the food was pretty good and service was pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is spot on and inexpensive...the lead chef Yung and his boys nail it every time I go there which is nearly weekly.  AYCE on lunch is about 21$ , sit at the bar and the guys are extremely fast at producing super quality rolls, etc."}
{"text":"This place is awesome I've been here about 9 times now and I have never been disappointed 
The staff is excellent and the cooks definitely know what they are doing 
I recommend this place to all my friends and family 
Blue fin you guys rocks"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, fresh fish.  Some of the best sushi I have had in Vegas.  The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is the atmosphere.  The staff is very nice but the inside feels cramped and dated."}
{"text":"Came in at 2237 and made me feel as unwelcomed as possible. Fuck you for that sorry ass Mexican sever."}
{"text":"When people ask where they should go for AYCE sushi I recommend Blue Fin sushi as one of my top three favorite places.  I can come here and order from the nigiri and appetizer section and be content for a full meal.  

The place is not too big and they have outdoor seating but I enjoy my sushi at the bar.  The chefs are personable.  Well, one more than the other but the quality is beyond good of that other AYCE sushi places.  They have specialty items as well and most people don't know the difference but I can taste it.  Big eye tuna for example, hello!  Please continue to serve people the all you can eat grade sushi while I indulge on this delicacy.  

To me, it's also apparently clear they do not use short cuts when it comes to the fishes they use to serve their guests.  One of the main reasons why their Saba, mackerel, is good is because they take the time to cut and marinate it before serving it.  Unlike Kaze Sushi who buys it in blocks and ready to serve, bleh.  Then again, not too many can taste the difference.  But if a sushi place has belly's of salmon, yellow tail, or bones of mackerel, then you know they take the care to prep their own goods.  Bravo.

Depending on the volume of customers in the restaurant I try to plan my visit while it's at their lowest capacity.  I would like to thank the Queen of Blue Fin Sushi Lisa R. for introducing me to this place and continually posting pictures up because this is one place I am not shy about using my phone and showing the sushi chefs pictures of what I want.  So as far as what I recommend having here, remember I usually only do nigiri/plain sushi so as a reader you've seen the pictures already and that is what I recommend.  Anything you see a picture of."}
{"text":"SUSHI as amazing at one time now we go there for the chef he his funny as hell."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  Fresh food, well-prepared, with both classic selections and great innovation through their specialty rolls.  The prices were great, even offering all you can eat specials for lunch and dinner.  This is not \"all you can eat\" quality, though, it's sit-down, specialty quality!  Fantastic service, too.  I can't say enough great things about this place.  I found it through Urban Spoon during a trip to Vegas, and couldn't believe it wasn't packed on a Saturday night!  Go here anytime you want great, great sushi!"}
{"text":"Yes and no.... went for lunch with 5 other people, they decided to go for the all you can eat. No point for me since I eat Vegan. The all you can eat look great for the price and the service was good and fast. But the vegi roll was just a roll full of lettuce and pretty tasteless."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite all you can eat sushi, I've come about 15 times and never regret my choice. The cost is about $26 for lunch and $30 for dinner but if you come hungry you will for sure eat your money worth. I recommend the wet dream and  there wide selection of deep fried roles. When leaving always remember you still have room for some mochi! Also I gotta say one last thing about the service. Incredible. If you order half rolls they take longer because they aren't as much of a priority ( money maker ) in a way, sushi can be a little confusing, but there servers will immediately take your plate- refill when needed, it is fantastic. Just know that the more water you drink the more the rice will absorb!"}
{"text":"Wow...  Like seriously, wow.  My buddy and i came back early from Brian Head today due to windy conditions and ended up here since it was closer to his new home.   

I came in expecting a 4, but we end up with an easy 5star experience.  The portion of rice to fish ratio was unbelievably excellent.  The vinegar in the rice was spot on perfect.  ALL the fishes were extremely fresh and the best part is that we didn't even have to bribe the sushi chef any with Saki.  They all came like this!
-Halibut
-Albacore
-Yellowtail
-Tuna
-Garlic Tuna
-Salmon
-White Tuna
-Salmon Skin Hand Roll 
-Spicy Yellowtail w/ Avocado Nigiri - Big chunks of Hamachi
-Saltwater Eel
-Mackerel

We didn't order and cut rolls, but from the looks of other patron's orders they look nicely well made and prob taste 'dericious' as well too!  

We also ordered Hamachi Kama in the beginning of our meal and it came toward the end.  The pic says it all http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w?select=fyqUFthRjAn9X7ihnZQfmA I mean look at the size of the thing! 

I've been turned off from AYCE sushi joints mainly because the downhill route most establishment are undertaking, but relief to see that Blue Fin still kept it real after all this time.  As far as the drive is, i think i will come here now for all my maximum sushi stuffing face time

*Note*  I'm also pleased to announce that i converted my buddy who was a Yama fan to Blue Fin :X"}
{"text":"This week was my first time and wasn't disappointed. I've had Blue Fin Sushi & Roll bookmarked ever since I've read all their positive reviews.  Last week I had overall poor experience at a sushi restaurant in San Diego. I don't want to embarrass I-Sushi so I won't mention their name.  I knew redemption was needed and needed quick.

My visit was during lunch time and chose their AYCE for $21.99. I want to add that from the outside, this joint looks bigger than it really is.  The ambiance was perfect around 11:40 AM for someone eating alone and we all know for the best service, you have eat at the bar near the sushi artists. There was only one other patron here at the time. That only lasted about 20 minutes because once noon hit, the fans started showing up. Every seat was taken and a line was forming by 12:30 PM. Just keeping up with the Jones'. Just another sign that Blue Fin is the way to go.

I had a couple of items for my AYCE venture;
-Nigiri: Yellowtail, Salmon, and the Garlic Spicy Tuna
-Rolls:  Tried their Rock and Roll, which is a cucumber wrapped roll with crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail
-Hand Rolls: Spicy Crab and the Crunch Shrimp

Everything I've tried was delicious and fresh. I thought that the Nigiri's were small, but it's all you can eat. Order more if it's not enough.  I did just that, I ordered and ordered until I was able to erase my last poor experience in San Diego.  To be honest, the food was so satisfying here that just my first nigiri already made up for it.

This review cannot end without commenting on the service. 5 stars for service alone. Even though I was just one of about forty that was eating here, they made me feel like a rockstar (no, not the energy drink).  Watch these guys in action. Rolls, bowls, and shashimi's ordered and delivered with the quickness. All it takes is some eye contact and they're ready to take your request.

My only gripe about this place...it's on the opposite side of town from where I am normally at. Guess that's not their fault. 

On a side note...thanks to all the fellow Yelpers that either gave suggestions for next time or wished me a good lunch due to my experience over the weekend. You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Blue Fin a few times since my initial review and sadly, each time I go, I am less impressed by both the service and the food. When I go to my other go-to spot in town for sushi I always walk out stuffed and happy, even if the service was slipping a bit (which seems to be happening more and more these days). When I walk out of Blue Fin lately, I am full but wishing I had gone somewhere else...

My favorite thing to order at a sushi spot is hotate nigiri (scallops) however Blue Fin does not offer up hotate, only \"yum yum scallops\" which is scallops chopped up and mixed with mayo. Gross. No thank you. 

Blue Fin does not offer up half rolls. For me it is sometimes difficult to enjoy a place that has AYCE but does not offer up half rolls as an option... Some of my favorite dining companions either do not eat sushi at all, or do not eat enough to warrant paying for AYCE, and I have found that I personally can not get my money worth if I try to go the AYCE route at Blue Fin. 

Part of that is due to how oversized some of the menu items are. As others have mentions, many of the rolls are so large they have to be eaten in multiple bites. I was taught sushi should be eaten in one bite. Some of the appetizers are oversized as well, the cucumber salad I had on my last visit was ridiculously large. Sometimes, bigger is NOT better. 

Some of my favorite Vegas Yelpers love Blue Fin, people that have recommended other places I love. Perhaps I need to go to Blue Fin with them, to see if they are ordering things I am not and perhaps that is my problem? Until then, I am going to hold off on Blue Fin for a bit as there are numerous other places in town where I can get my need for sushi met."}
{"text":"Love this place. I don't usually eat sushi because I can not handle texture of raw anything. And FISH? When my friend invited me i was not so sure about it. But I am so glad i went. I had a buffet dinner for 25.50$ I think its pretty reasonable. I started with green ice tea. I am a tea drinker. I know when the tea is good.  They have so many dishes of cooked food for people like me. I started the meal with a seaweed salad. i like it a lot. Miso soup is too thick for my taste though. They use different type of miso paste. The Salmon killer is amazing. I can't smell or taste anything like raw fish at all. The fish is cured and so fresh. Hand roll are so awesome as well. I tried spicy crab and the crunch which is shrimp tempura. I had greentea icecream for dessert.
I definitely will go back and recommend this restaurant to anyone.
The only problem is my friend did not get her order. They were really busy that night."}
{"text":"On my second visit, I wanted to love this place even more. Instead, I had to take it down a notch.

The lunch was quite satisfying overall. One thing that I didn't quite remember from last time was that the appetizer portions are all pretty large. They're definitely shareable if you come in a pair or more. I enjoyed the \"pizza mussels\" again, and the tuna crab cakes were a worthy substitute for the dinner-only soft shell crab. The salmon skin salad was nice and crunchy as well.

Moving away from appetizers, the salmon, super white, and cajun albacore nigiri were all really good. I could order those over and over all day. The unagi nigiri was also good as expected. The salmon lover roll and the Mexican roll (not the royal Mexican, didn't try that one) both won me over at first bite, and the white tiger was pretty good if you like the garlic kick. I liked the Blue Fin lasagna roll too. Heck, a lot of the other menu rolls sounded really good, and I really wanna go back and try those.

The only issue is that there was quite a bit of wasabi sandwiched between the fish and the rice on some of the nigiri. Finding these wasabi bombs is not all that pleasant if you're not a wasabi person or if you've already put a decent amount of wasabi in your soy sauce. Obviously I'll have to skip the wasabi next time, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it as much as I want to then."}
{"text":"Husband and I love this place. Great sushi and great service. We go here whenever we are. Racing sushi and they never let us down."}
{"text":"like most korean chef sushi bars, it only give you part of what your order. the fish to rice ratio is not that good.  Food taste is second rated in my opinion. 

I would go to sushi twister instead if am in the same neighborhood"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just because of the cooks making the food last night (since it's my first time being here) or maybe it's that bad all the time. Everything was extremely overly salted! Left the restaurant feeling disgusted. The service was great, I'll give them that! Never had a dirty/empty plate on the table for longer than a few minutes, food came out just as quick as we ordered it, and the mochi was alll you can eat as well!!!"}
{"text":"After the great review that I wrote the first time I have to say that this place turned out to be a rip off. They made ua wait for an hour without serving us any roll as a strategy for people to eat less. Worst thing is that when we complained the ignorant manager told us yo go if we didn't want to wait instead of accepting that what they were doing is a rip off. Of course we will never come back again.."}
{"text":"Not all that, kinda disappointed. 95% of there rolls are filled with crab meat. There Eel sauce has a different taste. I've tried several sushi places here in Vegas unfortunately the best sushi by far is Yama Sushi"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Great service, great food. We did the AYCE and so worth it. The entire menu is included, so don't be shy!! Everything we got was amazing. So fresh. Tasty. Service was incredibly fast and super friendly. The feel of the restaurant is chill and laid back. They don't make you feel rushed and are quick to suggest and explain different items on the menu. There are several items on that are for the dinner AYCE (The Screaming Orgasm is one), so just look for the yellow asterisk. All in all this is one sushi place that I will for sure be coming back to and bringing lots of friends with me!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place for AYCE. It's one of the best values in town. The quality and quantity are amazing. And we've always had great service from wait staff to the managers, they're all very attentive and urge you to keep ordering. The fish is fresh and they load you up with thick pieces of Nigiri and very little rice plus larger than normal rolls. They allow you to order half rolls for uncooked rolls. Their gyoza, shumai and shrimp tempura are also delicious and always freshly cooked. They have saki specials weekly. I highly recommend their dinner AYCE. It's a small place and there's a line on weekends so make a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times just never wrote a review!
When it comes to sushi I'm still what I consider a beginner, I stick to cut rolls and of course I have my favorites!
So if this helps anyone that hasn't been here before by giving them an idea of what's good then I feel I've done a service.
My usual ones that I get are,
Wet Dream, Johnny Johnny, The Mexican, Tokyo Express.
You will not be disappointed with any of these for rolls.
The service is always spot on."}
{"text":"This restaurant hits all the spots. Clean, fresh food, and great service. We have never had a bad experience and enjoy coming for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Looks like you've changed your menu a bit and I'm glad! The fish was fresh, service was great for a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! They have the best garlic tunas in town! I have to eat here at least once a week!!!!"}
{"text":"After all these raving reviews from fellow yelpers, I was so excited to try this new place. However, I was not impressed unfortunately which left me unsatisfied. There was nothing really special about the menu and everything was so saucy that it overwhelmed the fish. The rolls that we tried were the Blue Fin Special, Tokyo Express and the Shellfish Love. Out of all of that, I think the Blue Fin Special was the best roll and that was soaked in sauce. The redeeming factor of the night was that the sushi chef made us a special roll with bean curd skin and various fish. That was tasty. The nigri (salmon, garlic tuna, albacore and yellowtail) was pretty good and I was pretty impressed that sweet shrimp was on the menu which we did order.  The service was attentive and for a Friday night there was not too many of us. Overall, I am not sure I would make the drive out here again, but who knows....there's always second chances."}
{"text":"What a great sushi restaurant.

Everything I ordered tasted great and the prices were reasonable. Service was prompt and friendly.

The all you can eat deal is a fantastic value. Especially if you like Nigiri."}
{"text":"Great place. A la cart sushi is my new thing. I am getting a little tired of the all you can thing, at least for a while. This however was all you can eat. Great quality though and very good service. I didn't actually eat too much, which was good. Had a bunch of apps, poke, soft shell crap. Lots of nigiri and a few rolls. Overall we were very satisfied and I am sure we'd be regulars if this place wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"OKAY I know I'm from Japan so I have high expectations for sushi, BUT that also means I've eaten at every other sushi restaurant in Vegas so I know what's \"good\" for Vegas and also what's bad. Well, I thought I knew what was considered bad, but I really didn't until I tried Blue Fin. I've had better sushi rolls from the grocery store deli. And the nigiri? I won't even talk about that because it was on another level of bad. 
Baked green mussels: I've never seen mussels served this way. Mussels are the umbrella term for a groups of molluscs that have a common shell. A common SHELL. The mussels here weren't in their shells!!!!!! They were served in an egg carton like plate with the meat de-shelled and placed in each cup with 5x the amount of sauce melted on top of the teeny tiny piece of meat. I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of sriracha and mayo with a topping of mussel. 
Rolls: As a 5 person party we ordered a lot of rolls. The rice was dry in every roll and the seaweed had that wet but tough consistency where you had to eat each piece of the roll whole or else you wouldn't be able to tear through it with your teeth. Oh, and the raw fish was like that too. Rubbery and difficult to tear with your teeth. Yuck. I tried to stick to cooked rolls after that, but it wasn't much better. 
All sushi restaurants have that \"if you leave sushi on your plate we'll charge you,\" clause on their menus, but that has never been an issue for me until Blue Fin. There were a couple of pieces of nigiri that were so bad no one in our 5 person group could finish it. We had 4 pieces left on our table and the waiter instructed us that they would not clear our plates until we finished it and if we didn't they would charge us. I understand that AYCE sushi restaurants need to have rules like this, but the nigiri was so bad there was no way any of us could finish it. Sorry we wasted those 4 pieces of very low quality fish you purchased. 
There was no one Japanese working in the restaurant....... But I think that goes without saying. ;) I wanted to tell everyone eating at the restaurant that what they were eating was NOT sushi. Please don't come here and think this is what we eat in Japan! It hurts me to think that people think this is Japanese food :("}
{"text":"Great location, service and rolls. Favorite rolls are Rock and Roll, Tokyo express, Hawaiian and Arizona. I like that I can stop by for lunch and food comes out fast enough to enjoy, pay my check and get back to work. The restaurant is big enough to accommodate larger parties or you can just sit at the bar. I bring my international students regularly. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"No stars for sushi.  We ordered the AYCE which my date suggested.  The rolls were densely packed with flavorless rice, filled with a crab mayonnaise mixture and topped with  a thin piece of fish leaving the roll exposed on the sides.  The seaweed was not crisp and flavorful, probably too moist from the rice compactor method used in their rolling system; u know those  kits they have to make sushi in a mold. The rice roll slices looked too square it doesn't look nor feel as if hand  rolled.   I regret not suggesting my favorite sushi place.  Not worth the deal they have with AYCE."}
{"text":"My go to place for sushi for lunch. Fresh and quick all you can eat! Love the Dr. Roll. If I am in the area I always make the effort to eat there. Service is attentive and quick! Must try..."}
{"text":"It was a very delicious place and the environment was very relaxing. The choices were great and everything was fresh. Gonna return for another great date"}
{"text":"They have an all you can eat menu!!! Yes I love being able to eat endless Japanese food the only reason not giving them 5 stars is because I've been to a lot of all you can eat Japanese restaurants and the menus had a lot more than blue fin did. The food was really good along with service if you're in the area make sure to stop and eat!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here pretty frequently, usually for ayce sushi. Fish tastes pretty fresh, the quality is good for ayce and it's presented nicely. I normally eat mostly nigiri so i can't say much for the rolls but I've liked all of the chef's specials rolls I've tried. Love the service here! They are always fast seat you, bring out food, clear plates, and refill drinks. We never have to ask the servers for anything because they're always on it. They recently expanded so there's never a wait and sports fans they are always playing espn on the tvs."}
{"text":"Regardless what time of the day you go! You are going to have amazing service... This is my favorite sushi buffet in the Vegas and Henderson area. Janine was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided great suggestions based on my flavor profile I shared with her. 

I will come here again!"}
{"text":"I got sick the same night I ate here.   Threw up two.days, shits the third day.  Was told this was the best place to eat, but my food didnt seemed.fresh when.I got.it, I knew it, got sick.   I am making sure everyone that eats sushi, does not.go here"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place!! Their rolls are always great & their lunch specials are fantastic. I've tried quite a few places around Vegas & I always come back here for the best spicy tuna."}
{"text":"HIT OR MISS! Some days it's good most days is bad. I have stopped eating here, last time I did I couldn't even finish my roll and I only ordered one, the fish was so rank. Service was always so bad, missing orders, mixing up orders, not even being around. There's definitely better AYCE sushi in Henderson"}
{"text":"Not bad. I'm pretty picky with my all u can eat sushi places and always go to the same ones. This place is pretty good. Ok selection. The sushi tasted good. I would go here again if in the area."}
{"text":"The worst Sushi I have had in Vegas.  It was expensive for buffet quality fare.  Every appetizer felt like it came from a Costco sized box of mediocrity.  The service was of equal scale.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls.  Fast preperation for my take out order. If in the area I'll stop in again. It is however a bit on the pricey side for the take out. I don't know if they offer an all you can eat option.  4 rolls left two of us with left over pieces. So I don't know that it would be any cheaper if your paying all you can eat, and we only eat 3 1/2 rolls.  We will stick to ordering of the menu."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a coworker and I have been addicted since. When I go out for All You Can Eat Sushi, this is the spot! Everything I have tried here has been incredible. I have even brought friends from Cali here who say this is better than their local sushi spots. I always start with the RM Spicy Roll and the Spicy Garlic Tuna. It's what sushi dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love Blue Fin as the service was EXCELLENT, but sushi quality was not very good.
The tuna was fatty and the rolls way to big to fit into a bite. They don't offer half portions and come with the standard AYCE warning about being charged menu price for unfinished sushi. However, we left sushi on the table but were not charged. Staff was very friendly and accommodating so I feel bad going off on the sushi but can't give an honest review without mentioning that I was disappointed. Garlic tuna had wasabi on it which I do not care for. Most places usually stick to just garlic & sauce and let customers put wasabi on it themselves.
I would recommend smaller bite sized rolls and half portions so you don't commit to something you don't like. The Screaming Orgasm's special sauce was underwhelming and lacked that tangy punch I was hoping for.
Because of the super nice staff, we might come back in a few months to try it again...a la carte."}
{"text":"At this point I come here as much as I do as Yama Sushi. I always ignored this place for one reason of another, probably because it was on Sunset and I would rather stick to solid sushi. Nothing is worse than chucking $25+ on subpar sushi. This isn't the case at all.

I love the ambiance and the side of the building is quite tidy, but still spacious. I love the service and have never had a bad experience. Even though I'm quite the sushi snob I still have a horrible time remembering most names of rolls.

But any place that has a solid roll that has Garlic Ponzu (see Kan Pai Sushi) gets major points. I always try the shrimp, albacore and unagi. Solid, Solid, Solid. It's only until recently I remembered I can order pot stickers AYCE as well, definately try it.

All of the Blue Fin Specials (tempura or standard) are rock solid. I don't get the 2 or 1 star reviews, it's solid overall and I'm quite picky in regards to sushi.

You only get 1 hour to order sushi for AYCE but that's more than enough thanks to the fast service. This is a good alternative or complement with Yama Sushi. The menu is a bit smaller but I feel they have a wider variety of tastes compared to Yama.

Regardless, try it out. Solid place!"}
{"text":"Blue Fin is an exceptional place to go for sushi. I love how every time I visit, the fish is always so fresh. I am very picky about how my sushi tastes (freshness being the main factor), but they do not disappoint. I love their salmon, and my mother is fan of their yellowtail. She specifically asks for the belly of the yellowtail, and they kindly give her the best. Just be sure to ask! They won't decline. 

The owner is very friendly, and he and his brother are wonderful at preparing the food. If you are a regular there, they will throw in an roll for you on the house. The servers are very prompt at clearing your plates and refilling your drinks. Blue Fin is definitely one of my favorite places for consistently delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Hmmm. After reading the reviews, it's weird to see so many hit and misses. I absolutely love this place! I lived right by this place for YEARS and never gave it a shot. It took moving over to the Southwest side of town and being so disappointed in many of the places over here for me to try this place. We get the teriyaki combos and it's literally the best teriyaki I've had from any sushi place - and let me tell you I've tried a TON of sushi places in Las Vegas, and for someone who didn't try sushi until a few years ago, it's nice to have options when you don't want fish. 

Now, the sushi is actually good here. I liked it. It was good proportions and tasted right. It wasn't too cold or too warm. It was great in my opinion. I liked that I could take my younger sister here and she could actually eat the things that they were suggesting."}
{"text":"This place is simply the best sushi in Vegas. Not very crowded most of the time making it a real hidden gem. The all you can eat lunch and dinner menu are stuffed to the gills with awesome choices I highly recommended the chicken teriyaki appetizer and the lightly salted edamame. With the rolls is really up to you on what tickles your fancy but everything here is fantastic in not a huge fan of the yum yum sauce so I substitute for eel but regardless I just cannot say enough good things about this little spot absolutely great the only reason I just can't give it five stars is because their drink options are fairly limited but even so if you are looking for a great date lunch or dinner spot this is going to be a great pick I promise you."}
{"text":"Mom and I were looking for a AYCE sushi and found this very reasonable place only 21.00 for lunch. Happy girls"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.. must trys blue fin lasagna... Western.....Over the rainbow...Everything so good. Great service. Clean"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  This place is small, so if they are having a big party coming in, you will have to sit at the bar, outside or just wait, but the service is AWESOME.  I have never seen a place with the service as fast as they have here.  

If you have to wait, the wait is worth the food you will receive.  They do have all you can eat and like most other all you can eat sushi places, you will get your food faster here then any place I have been before. 

The rolls are overloaded with rice, they are a nice size with a good amount of stuff inside and on top and it is fresh and tastes great.  

A must try place, and a place we will go back to without question."}
{"text":"I saw all of these amazing reviews for this place so I decided to give it a try. I went on a Friday night at around 8pm. Atmosphere was ok. The servers ignored my table of 4 for a while. We finally ordered 4 rolls and well as a sushi regular, everyone knows it taked a good 10-15 minutes for at least 2  rolls to come out. We received all 4 in 5 minutes! We all looked at each other and thought, \"wow, that was fast!\". The sushi tasted like refrigerated sushi or the sushi you get from the supet market. We were extremely disappointed. We will never go back."}
{"text":"I have tried many different AYCE sushi restaurants in the valley and this place is my new favorite!  I have gone to Goyemon (#2 fave), Sin City (#3), Island, Inaka, Sushi Mon and several others.  Blue Fin wins hands down for me...everything was very fresh and very delicious.  I hardly used any soy at all.  The sushi wasn't drowned in sauce (Island is guilty of that lately) nor was it covered in too much crunchy stuff (most places).  Everything I had was amazing:  nigiri (dont miss the delicious spicy garlic tuna, amazing cajun albacore and the best unagi ever), specialty rolls and hand rolls.  Anything served with eel and/or eel sauce in this place was incredible...perfectly cooked and the sauce was out of this world.  One of the rolls had SPICY EEL SAUCE...I was in heaven!  I can't say enough about this place...its THAT good.  It was puzzling to me why it wasnt busier on a sunday around 12:30.  It was $22 for lunch...about the same as everywhere else. Please people....GO HERE!  Service was very good throughout.  Don't miss the peach or grapefruit sparkling sake."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time sitting at the bar was fairly pleasant and for AYCE it was decent. 

I just left now and it sucked balls. Hard. Sat a a table in the main room. Skimped on every possible item from avocado to tuna. Slathered crappy sauce on everything.  The screaming O sauce was just watery mayo no flavor. 

The final straw was that this place had THE most piss poor service I've had in any type of restaurant I can recall.  From the cocky water boy/food runner who could neither bring water or bring out the right rolls. Bro, there are a lot of people that would be happy for a job right now. Lose the attitude. Moving on to our waitress who at one point I thought would need to be carried to our table to take our order. 

Didn't get a few items we ordered.  Including soup to just stay warm in that meat locker like temperature they kept the restaurant at. 

After a few rolls we got the hell out of there. It was 48 degrees outside and about 45 inside.  

I  Sushi, I promise to never stray again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it's been okay. But today it was awful. I ordered the sashimi plate and saw a fish i couldn't identify. It wasn't a smooth cut either, looked like it was hacked off a frozen fish, seriously i thought that. It didn't smell so i tried it and spat it out, yes mushy,  frozen,  i complained and was given more yellow tail. The fourth piece of fish i tried had a slight off taste. Now my wife and i have the sh!tz - never again! Should've left ASAP.  So now I'm warning you guys,  stay clear, there's no way these \"Chefs\" should let such inferior fish go out, you could tell just by the cut. Be forewarned!"}
{"text":"I feel like I need to write an update since somehow I am the only reviewer and I last reviewed in November 2008.  This is hands down the best sushi place in Vegas.  I grew up eating Gulf Coast sushi in Houston and always thought that was the freshest, the best...but seriously, Chef Jin gets fresh fish daily, and gets his hands on anything exotic.

Last night he treated me to madai, Japanese snapper, a fresh fish he sliced off the filet during dinner.  He is always creating new things.  I just go and never order - he makes whatever (knows what I like and what I don't), and he and his wife (the outstanding waitress and hostess Yura) are so kind.  I get matcha iced tea without asking.  I have a favorite seat.  They put on sports on the flatscreen when I come in.

Honestly, I worried when he added all-you-can-eat because the quality is too good.  You can get any roll, any appetizer (including hamachi kama), any salad, any nigiri, handrolls, ikura, uni, sweet shrimp, tempura, mochi, you name it - for $25.95.  I only do all you can eat on a rare occasion because I usually just eat nigiri and maybe a handroll or interesting creation.  Rolls are too filling for me.

In summary, the food is great, the service outstanding, the atmosphere quaint and casual, the prices reasonable, the green iced tea yummy, hot sake ready, and for the special occasion, I get the chocolate souffle for dessert.  I couldn't live without this neighborhood joint!  Just see my zillion pics for food inspiration."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have been back here because I live on the other side of town, but I revisited to find I am not missing out on anything.

Rolls are huge and packed with bland,cheap, fake crab.  I used to love the Coco roll but it was really disappointing this time.  Screaming orgasm sauce was just pure mayonnaise with none of the acidity that I love and expect.  Garlic tuna and Happy Ending roll were not good either.  I did like the uni and some of the nigiri and my husband loved their take on baked mussels - which was served escargot style and covered in cheese. Not worth going back, though."}
{"text":"This place just keeps the food coming to your table, non-stop! Great service & all you can eat for $21.99....first time trying green tea fried ice cream, simply scrumptious!! A yummy place to eat! I am not even a sushi fan but they have so much more on the menu that I really enjoyed a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"The Blue Fin Sushi was tempting to try, so I went with my 12 yr. old daughter. I did AYCE. The sushi was okay. But guess what? There was TOO MUCH RICE. And they say whatever is leftover, they charge extra. I think they put too much rice on the sushi to purposely charge extra. So I know I'm never going here again, neither is my daughter. Remember, if you're thinking about going here, just remember.. THERE. IS. TOO. MUCH. RICE. ON. THE. SUSHI. AND. THEY. WILL. CHARGE. YOU. EXTRA. PURPOSELY."}
{"text":"Recently decided to try a new sushi spot since the last place started going down hill.. (new chefs) Blue Fin definitely delivered! Nigiri was on point! Cajun albacore was by far one of my favorites in town. Very creative rolls (lots of cream cheese if your into that) all the classics and a few I've seen for the first time. The service was amazing as well, the staff was very friendly and worked as a team. Great experience will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I never thought fish would taste this fresh out in the desert. I mean you don't really see schools of tuna and salmon leaping through the sand on it's way to your belly.

Well Blue Fin's got some sort of deal worked out and they are getting great fish and shellfish. My friends and I opted for the all you can eat option which really put a lot of things on the table in terms of \"i wouldn't get this normally but what the heck\". For their all you can eat you can get uni (sea urchin) and hamachi kama(yellowtail collar) which aren't super common in a lot of places and were both pretty good. I've had better hamachi kama but that's not to say theirs was bad, just average.

Give their mexican roll a try. It's sort of like a philadelphia roll in a tortilla and the fried. I know it sounds crazy but it was actually good. and this is coming from someone that doesn't normally like cream cheese all up in my sushi.

Finally my last recommendation would be that if you get all you can eat, ask the chef's to make you a hand roll with whatever they feel like is good. Those are some smart guys that a few dishes into your meal will probably have a sense of your palette and will be able to put something special together for you.

anyways, the service was great, folks were nice, yadda yadda yadda if they had one in washington dc where i now live you'd probably see me there once a month"}
{"text":"I was pregnant and was not able to come back here for a long while. Now when I arrived, the whole place was renovated. It's nice and pretty but when I asked the server if chef Tony is here, she gave me a weird look and told me she don't know anyone named tony. Now I'm scared if the good will taste the same. On the first round I ordered my fav appetizers and rolls to see if there's any difference. I'm always excited to eat baked mussels here, they have a distinct sauce that is not like other places; but I got disappointed big time... It tasted bland and not all in any hint close to their previous taste. 
I'm trying to keep an open mind and not think that it's a different chef. The coco roll was still good, I'm guessing they still have good quality fresh ingredients. Other 5 rolls I ordered are also not bad, but I notice more rice now and too much sauce. The baked scallops were too tiny and covered with so much breading you can barely see the scallop inside. 
I don't know what happened here but if they read this review I'm hoping they will contact the old owner and get in touch with chef tony. This place is now just like any other AYCE sushi places I've been to... And honestly I'd rather go somewhere else ... 
The server aside from giving me a weird look and didn't want to take my order until my other orders arrive; I'd say I will give her 2stars. Plus instead of refilling my hubby's lemonade, she gave him water and my husband wondered if there is no free refill for a simple lemonade."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent. Nothing to get crazy about. 
Service was ok. I had to ask for wasabi and ginger."}
{"text":"After seeing a review in the Las Vegas Review Journal showing A's in every category I visited this restaurant Tuesday, March 11, 2014. Was surprised to see how many already knew about this place. 
 
Although my girlfriend thought the restaurant had a bit of a fishy smell, I have to say we all thought the food was fresh and quite good. They have an \"all you can eat\" sushi for 24.99 which is a great deal if you want several sushi items . However, sitting at the counter, I was never asked if I wanted to do this offer or not. It was not until the bill came that I saw the \"all you can eat\" price on it. I was not doing the \"all you can eat\" and had just ordered one item and salad, which came to a total of 15.00. 

I definitely recommend that you tell whoever takes your order, (whether it be a waitress or the sushi chef behind the counter), if you do or do not want the \"all you can eat\" offer.  Apparently, if you do not say anything, you will be charged for it. 

Competition is tough, with many followers liking I LOVE SUSHI, SPICY TUNA, OR MOMOSUSHI. It is important that customers don't feel like they are being swindled when dining and I suggest Blue Fin do their utmost to avoid the possibility of a customer feeling like they have been. Needing to correct the bill leaves a bad taste in one's mouth!"}
{"text":"If you like your sushi dry and stale, your avocados spoiled, your service curt and rude, and your AYCE sushi chef doing the eyeball roll, then this is the place for you.

If you like your sushi stunningly fresh, your service prompt and polite and your belly full and happy, then go to I Love Sushi on Eastern and Sunridge Heights."}
{"text":"Excellent service, rolls and my favourite nigiri are always on point! Love this place"}
{"text":"Came in tonight! Another good exsperince! 

I do get very confused who is our server when sitting at the sushi bar which makes trying to order certain things awkward but we always figure it out- I always recommend sitting at the sushi bar to mingle with the chefs when coming here because it;s fun. 

Some of the freshest fish in LV!"}
{"text":"Just all around awesome !!

My favorite roll is \"Wet dream\" omg really makes u wet . lol awesome chefs."}
{"text":"wow where do I start, the service was great they got me a high chair for my son without even asking me. The all you can eat is decent 21.99 before 3pm and 24.99 after 3pm. I swear I didn't get to try as much sushi as I wanted too. the size and quality of the sushi is by far the best I ever had. Wet dreams is so damn good and the Mexican is hella unique... trust me your not going to leave out this place unsatisfied... I know for sure I'll be going here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Blue Fin is my favorite AYCE in Vegas.  There are other good spots in town to get your sushi fix, but Blue Fin is the only place that I'll do AYCE alone.  That may sound anti social, but really, the sushi here is good enough that I'll dine all by myself and not have to worry about sharing.  Not that you have to worry about sharing, it is AYCE after all...but most of the time, doing AYCE is a group affair.

The fish here has been consistently fresh during my visits.  There are always different specials on the chalkboard to try out.  The rolls here are creative enough that I don't mind ordering one or two (I've very much become a nigiri and hand roll kind of guy).  You can also do half orders of rolls to make sure you get as much variety as possible during your meal.

So perhaps the last paragraph can apply to numerous spots in town...but the one thing that I think does it for me at Blue Fin is the sushi rice.  It is delicious, and I do not mind ordering nigiri in lieu of sashimi.  I like the rice that much.  It may be a little thing, but it makes my tastebuds happy.

Blue Fin's another one of those special places, the kind where you have to stop by if you're in the neighborhood.  I'm looking at you, Sunrise Coffee!  It's a perfect two-hit combo of an evening."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went for a date night, thinking we could do all you can eat but we couldn't. The sushi and cucumber salad were amazing. The highlight of the night tho was Alex he was beyond amazing and goes above and beyond for his customers. We will be back for the great food and most of all Alex!"}
{"text":"Found them on yelps, very fast service for Saturday night. Uni is very fresh, the screaming orgasms is a must have. Happy that I try this place out. If I'm ever at this place will eat again. Thanks"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with friends and had a great meal. Good location on Sunset near I49 and middle of NWA and easy to get to from north (Bentonville) or South (Fay). Started with edamame and was ample but not quite salty or steamed enough. Not a big deal and we still dug in. Lots of options regarding rolls and we stuck to solid choices including shrimp tempura, crunch salmon, volcano and BBQ. Our favorites were the unique ones with the BBQ being the best. Great portion with unique familiar flavor. Next favorite was volcano - again large, shareable size and great combination of flavor sand textures. Best part was value regarding prices and amount of good food. Well presented and great atmosphere for friends and people talking and sharing a meal."}
{"text":"4.3 Stars

Location Overview:
First impression is everything. Walking into this location I was a tad bit worried about how small this building was. It is actually quite a small place for sushi. There are only about 6-8 tables inside. And about another 6-8 tables outside in a little patio section. The place is clean and in this situation size is not everything.

Customer Service:
Customer service here was on point. The guy serving us came out to our table just about every 5mins to make sure we had enough drinks and had a new roll ready for the all you can eat. Walking in we were greeted by all staff as well as leaving. Never had to wait long for our waiter to get something. 

Food Quality/Quantity:
The quality of the food is a lot better than what I was expecting. (After being worried about a small business in such a small building) I was more than impressed with the size of the menu. I of course did the all you can eat which is about the same price as every other sushi restaurant. The quality of the sushi was great. With the awesome designs on the food it made it fun to eat. The taste of each roll definitely fit the names of the sushi rolls. The quantity was more than enough for each roll. I noticed that they actually cut a couple more sushi pieces into the roll (not sure if it is the same size or not). The food came out at a decent time. never waiting longer than 15mins for anything to get to us. 

Side Notes:
Not recommended for a large party."}
{"text":"Wow! Can you say \"food coma?\" I don't know sushi very well, I am only a year or two into it. However, I have had bad sushi and I have had the best. Their sushi is fantastic when it comes to flavor. The Red Dragon was extremely good. The spicy tuna was excellent. The spicy crab was ok, but it's also the first time I've tried that dish.

Sushi is also about its presentation and I would say these guys could do a little better. It's the only reason they didn't get 5 stars. The flavor was so good, the presentation really doesn't matter. The service was excellent, fast, and very friendly. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times, celebrated my birthday here few days ago.  One of my favorite sushi place. Service always great.  Friendly employees.  I love the the ahi poke salad and all the other appetizers.  I'm so happy all you can eat mochi ice cream.  Not like other place, you can have one only.  I'll be coming back.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Me and my sweet lady ate here for dinner tonight. The food was okay and came out quick and the staff was wonderful, but too many staff on duty which made it felt awkward due to the fact that they were watching us like a hawk as we eat so it wasent that enjoyable."}
{"text":"We went there for date night.
My wife and I decided to try the all-you-can-eat sushi. Everything was so delicious. The Johnny Johnny roll was my favorite roll.  
We got a bottle of sake and the bill came to $75
Great service very reasonable prices.
This might be our favorite new sushi spot."}
{"text":"First of all don't do al a carte it's a waste of money..  Second this place doesn't know how to do AYCE sushi right.  they have huge portions for salads and appetizers making me think they don't want you to be able to finish so they can charge you extra or they don't want you to eat much. Not allowing you to get your money's worth. This is made more apparent by the amount of rice used in their rolls which for me is borderline hard to eat.  If the owners or management reads this I urge you to do smaller portions. It's all you can eat people get a grip. As a chef I can only assume you have massive food waste. Smaller apps smaller rolls even not only will you be happier but your customer will too trying more rolls and thinking they ate more.     

Having said that the service is ok. Pricing is ok. Taste is ok. Temperature is too warm for my liking..food not atmosphere. 

If you want really good sushi which honestly is my benchmark try 808."}
{"text":"Come here all the time.  The best thing about this place is the service.  I come with large groups many times so we order a bunch of food at once.  They are incredibly fast!  Within a couple minutes the fish come rolling in.  They are on top of all refills.  The sushi here is above average when compared to other AYCE places.  And the sushi chefs don't pack on a ton of rice.  The dining area is pretty big so there is never a long wait to get in.  I highly recommend.  Great food along with great service."}
{"text":"Good stuff! All the fish is really fresh and I recommend the White Tiger Roll. The only compliant I have is they only allow you to order 1 \"half\" roll."}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible, it took me forever to get someone's attention to help me. I wasn't even done with my food and then picked it up to take it."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place.  We had all you can eat so we were able to try quite a few rolls.  I didn't like the eel sauce at all, it was runny and actually seemed watered down?!?  Weird.  The water is tap water (not filtered) and was disgusting.  I did end up liking the sweetheart roll, but not enough to go back."}
{"text":"We came in on a Lent Friday night... and its a small place but packed to the brim. We found 2 seats at the sushi bar ready to try some different things. There are no papers to fill out, you just have to shout out your order to the chefs. 
Interestingly enough the AYCE menu applies to rolls, appetizers, salads, & desserts and comes equipped w/ its on separate menu. Believe it or not it also includes ayce chicken teriyaki. That's different - iv e not seen that before. It was delcious. 
the blue fin roll was my favorite. The ahi poke salad was really good. as was the red dragon. this was the first time I'd ever gone w/ the AYCE sushi option. I always just order one or 2 rolls and then get charged the AYCE price b/c of who I was sitting with. I hate that. So.. i decided to let myself be included and try the funky rolls since I get charged for it anyway. 
This place had pretty fresh tasting ingredients and as a note it had a 60 minute rule. i also ordered the volcano - but I wouldnt order it again. to be honest my bf ordered that for me - it wasnt my fav. 
I would go here again and like I said so far.. ths is my fav sushi place in hendo. ."}
{"text":"let me preface this review that i'm completely spoiled by SF sushi and i vowed NEVER to eat sushi in the desert!!!

ok, so i caved and after getting many \"you must try this place\" recommendations from work colleagues...

long story short sushi is fresh, staff is friendly and service is fast! PLUS the all you can eat option - enough said...

i'm hooked on eating sushi in the desert! highly recommend this spot!!!"}
{"text":"FORGETTABLE. With amazing food options available, it is a sin for a meal to be forgettable but that's exactly what this place was - forgettable. The service was spotty and we were there for a late lunch around 2:00 so there's no reason to not have great service. We were literally one of two tables there. If I have to get up or flag you down you've already blown it. 

The food was ok but I don't want just ok when I go out and pay for a meal. I want it to be amazing and the 4 star YELP reviews made me think this place was legit. So strange. I was just totally unimpressed. $80 lunch for three people and I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Another review goes out to Lisa L.! 

We are always on the lookout for great AYCE sushi - and we're bigger fans of the fish itself and not the rolls.  Blue Fin Sushi definitely impressed up with the quality of their fish.

First off, Blue Fin is a small restaurant - more like a mom and pop's place.  It's almost better to keep this place on the down low because I would hate to have to wait for a seat here.

Our party of three plus toddler went for the AYCE dinner option at $25.95/pp.  

First off - uni, limit one order per person and dinner only.  Because of the weather in California, they did not get their shipment.  Oh.  Would they be willing to give us an extra order of amaebi then?  Yes.  Sweet!  And when it arrived, it looked just fabulous and tasted good too!

We went to work ordering a bunch of nigiri and was pleasantly surprised with how they came out.  More often than not, AYCE sushi places just shove as many pieces on a plate as they can.  But they actually presented it quite nicely for us, which we appreciated.  We were especially impressed with their super white tuna, which I am certain was escolar.  (Super white tuna usually means albacore, so escolar is definitely a highlight!)  

Their version of ikura was a bit different - it actually seemed like they made it themselves since the eggs didn't separate and were still within the sac, if that makes any sense.

Another highlight was their spicy rolls - I'm not a fan of the Sriracha-based kind and this was mayo-based.  Yum!

We also really enjoyed their Soft Shell Crab Tempura (limit one order per person, dinner only).  It had a nice batter and was definitely tasty!

The Husband ordered the Grilled Yellowtail Collar (limit one order per person, dinner only), but hoped they had forgotten since he was getting full.  When it did arrive, it was a huge piece!  It looked like the equivalent of two collars usually served at other restaurants!

Another highlight - unlimited dessert! Green tea and red bean ice cream, mochi ice cream, and tempura ice cream are available.  The tempura ice cream is a huge scoop and we were surprised with how generous it was.

Service did take a bit long, and we were there for a good while, more than the hour time limit.  But there was only the only waitress and the restaurant definitely was filled to the max while we were there.  In this case, we didn't mind - but if it was just the two of us, we might have gotten a bit anxious.

Overall, Blue Fin Sushi is a place I would recommend for good quality sushi.  I can't comment on their fancy rolls, but we liked what we ate and would definitely go back!

There are outdoor tables, but I'm not sure it they open them up when the weather gets better or not.

Lunch (11:00 am to 3:00 pm) $21.95/pp
Dinner (3:00 pm to 11:00 pm) $25.95/pp
60 minute limit

Update! (05.12.10)

Went back for a return visit and we were both pleased with our experience there.

Only a handful of customers sitting at the sushi bar, and that's where we chose to sit as well.  Ordered a bunch of nigiri and they had uni this time as well.  The soft shell crab was served up on a nice bed of salad greens with a sauce on it this time, which wasn't a problem since we asked for no sauce the next time.  Overall, we took our time and was out within an hour.  They didn't disappoint on quality at all."}
{"text":"Waited about 2 hours and didn't get into sushi mon so called and this place got us in right away. We ordered a big order and got great service at first but turn services started to wane as we were there longer and they were not that busy. The sushi was pretty good and the Ayce was decently priced around 25 bucks. I would go back again."}
{"text":"There is a lot of all-you-can-eat sushi choices in Las Vegas, but this is one of the best, if not the best! Yum Yum Yum. The chefs are nice, it is not too busy most of the time. I love this place, esp the Wet Dream. My mouth is watering just thinking about it"}
{"text":"I like sushi alot. This place has an all you can eat option like most. The food is good I don't like how is says on the menu you have to eat all the rice or they will charge you. For me it puts stress on my meal. But the service was amazing and there salad dressing was delicious."}
{"text":"A Yelp loved spot I finally got a chance to check out. Every UYE here seems to fall when I get sick or have to work a crazy day. 

I came with a friend and a baby so we sat at the tables. I know what puts this place over the edge is the specialties of the sushi chef and I always believe sitting at the table puts you at a disadvantage unless you're already a rockstar customer. Just ordered strictly on menu things- those were all pretty good. 

Out of the appetizers I really like their big panko breaded soft shell crab. I'm a sucker for those things. Also got the baked mussels which were baked pieces in a escargot  ceramic instead of the shell...a little too cheesy/mayo-y for me. 

Nigiri wise- tried a bit of everything but the mackerel, the albacore, garlic tuna were standout lovely. The rice to fish ratio is proportional so no complaints there! I tried a bit of my friends rolls since she's a roll person and even the fried, mayo=y, cream cheesy rolls here weren't bad. . I had a Italian roll since it was the oddest roll on the menu with balsamic dressing and grapes on it. It worked actually and pretty good with the panko crunchies for some texture. I think it was because everything wasn't too heavily sauced that I was able to enjoy more rolls here. 

Service from the waitress was friendly and decent. She came by often to check on the baby, haha. 

I do get why this is a AYCE favorite as it is quality. I think the huge hype though is all the specials which I didnt really experience. For that, I must be back to get off menu things my Yelperazzi seem to really enjoy."}
{"text":"They only go got two stars because the food was okay. The service was awful. We were attending a group get together for my friends birthday. The woman who showed us the table did just that then completely walked away while I was trying to ask her a question (she was our main waitress). The next couldn't answer my question at all which was, \"did anyone mention bringing a cake? if not, can we bring one?\" Her answer was, \"first, there was 12 people coming but then there was a call for 25 people.\"  We ordered our drinks had them repeated back to us and the woman still got it wrong when she brought them. We were missing a sushi roll even though we repeated our order twice... It was just a bad, annoying first time experience."}
{"text":"Love the beef teriyaki however it's more onto the bulgogi side though. When I first started coming here they only had one super small section. Now they are still on the small side but more seats the price is okay not outrageous. Plus for me is that they have tempura fried ice cream. However what happened was as soon as I tried to cut it the ice cream slid out and i ended up with a chunk of tempura, not gonna lie it upset me. But it was still super tasty.  One of my favorite gems in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you like Sushi, and enjoy a quiet and cozy place. You should check this place out. I have been here 10 million times. The world is the world and I must admit that once my friend noticed a problem. But it was resolved and I still plan on going back at least a billion more times. Don't miss it if your in that area. Say hello to Wynot, Gene and Gene's brother."}
{"text":"So decided to come here and give Blue Fin a try, since everyone has been yelping about this place like crazy with good reviews..

I must say i was a bit disappointed.  Hate to do this but i must write about my experience.

So a friend and I decided to give this a try for lunch since everyone has been talking about this place. Not to brag or anything but my friend and I know what good sushi tastes like cause duh we are Asian, we have it down to the texture to the temperature and to the flavor.

I'm not sure if the food was just horrible just because it was lunch? But we were in shock how horrible the food was.

From what I remembered we ordered the baked mussels. We were like ok this is cool it's on little plates rather than on the shell. As we were chewing the mussels we were about to vomit. NO joke or exaggeration. For starters the mussels were not hot enough. It was not baked long enough so we were chewing cold mussels.

We decided to ignore that and try the other dishes.

We ordered the Ahi poke salad, that i must admit was really good, it was spicy and different than all the ahi poke salads we tasted. My friend enjoyed it as well.

Then we ordered the Shumai, Ehhh it was ok nothing too good.. Shumai is shumai they all taste the same in all the sushi places..

I decided to order the crab cakes since i have not seen crab cakes on the menu in a sushi place. I was disappointed. The crab cakes were cold and they tasted old, like they were sitting in the back for awhile.. no joke.

Decided to ignore that as well and we came to the ultimate test. The Nigiri and the Sushi.

So from what i remember we ordered the salmon nigiri. It was just ok. The temperature was not right it was too cold, and the rice was weird like it was old. I have to give them props at least the texture was good their was no veins at all in their Nigiri.  Same went for the tuna nigiri and all the other nigiri we had.

The sushi rolls were ok, kinda sucks they didnt do half rolls, I usually order half rolls to make sure i like the sushi.

Also during lunch time they didn't have Uni ( sea urchin) lunch is 22$ and dinner is 26$ something like that.. a difference of 4$ what does a difference of 4$ do, just add the sea urchin and all the other stuff not included in lunch, that's on the dinner menu.

Overall wasn't to fond of this place. I wouldn't mind giving it a try during the dinner time maybe dinner is much better than lunch.

Service was great the waitress was on top of everything and the cooks greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave.

I would give this a try again since i was in total shock of the ratings for this place, maybe i just caught this place on a bad day."}
{"text":"Love this place! My bestfriend & I are regulars. We always do AYCE. Haven't come across anything on the menu that I didn't like. You can do half rolls throughout and desserts are also AYCE. I only gave 4 stars because the service isn't consistent. I prefer the dinner shift because the servers/bussers are more friendly. Ask for Bernie! He's awesome."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews but this was by far one of our worst experiences out. Had lunch with my kids here and was not impressed at all unfortunately. We were sat at a table with no settings and had to ask for every little thing because our server didn't feel the need to do it on her own without us asking. Made us feel like a bother which I definitely don't like doing. As she brought out a few plates we had to keep asking her for chopsticks, napkins, soy sauce, ginger, & wasabi bc she kept forgetting. Smh 

The quality of the fish was ok but the Uni & Ikura tasted funny. It had a weird sweet after taste which I didn't like. The Udon was too salty too.

So midway into our meal we realized that some of our orders didn't come out so we had to actually ask her 2 3 times if it was still coming. Apparently she forgot to put it in. In the end we still never got our some of our orders and son's spider roll so said forget it. She was a horrible server. She later disappeared and was nowhere to be found. If it wasn't for the other guy that was there who was very nice and attentive to bringing out what we needed and taking over we would've made a complaint which we NEVER do. I feel bad because I can't remember his name, think maybe it was Omar or Carlos? He was the only guy there and maybe mexican. Credit for his great service not hers."}
{"text":"Gotta love AYCE sushi.  Sure, its not super fresh air flown fish.  Dare I say its seen the inside of a freezer but it makes up for it by offering a lot of creativity and big taste for a bargain.  At around $25, Blue Fin is an exceptional value.

Multiple visits.  Sometimes ordering just a single roll, other times for the AYCE to really put this place to the test.  Since everyone has their favorites, Ill simply make generalizations:

- Shrimp tempura rolls - The shrimp is what you would expect.  A little oily, overcooked, chewy shrimp that works really well in a roll.

- Unagi - Decent quality, perfectly broiled with a very tasty sauce.  Usually served on the outside of a roll so its sauce adds to the entire sushi.

- Soft shell crab - Previously frozen but deep fried to a oily but crispy goodness.  Just like the shrimp, a little oil in the sushi is a good thing.

- Spicy mayo (for scallop or tuna) - Spicy for sure and really good

All of the rolls are beautifully made and look incredible on the plate.  Best of all, they taste great!

Sushi aficionados, feel free to pay five times the price to enjoy the best on the Strip.  Just remember, good eats come at all prices.

{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!! The servers are amazing and the sushi is excellent!  They always go out of their way to make our dining experience so enjoyable each time we come in there!  My kids are ginger fiends, and they always bring them good sized bowls for each of them to have. Their prices are just right and they are quick to serve you even when you are not sitting at the bar. This is our go-to place for special occasions with the kiddos (birthdays, school celebrations, Mother's Day, etc.) because they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi buffet in the Vegas and Henderson area. The staff are very friendly, and their food is delicious. During lunch is the best time to go, as the all you can eat buffet is only $22 per a person. After 3pm its $26. The owners are super nice and actively involved with their company. I would consider this place a MUST for any sushi lovers in this area."}
{"text":"Sushi was AMAZING! Very high quality fish, super fresh. It's definitely a little jewel in Henderson."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in town. No slow service, no extra rice, great selection. Special rolls are inventive and tummy to my tummy.  I tell people to drive form the other side of town, and nobody has complained so far."}
{"text":"I finally made it all the way out to Blue Fin...it was one of my original bookmarks i've had for over a year, and I finally gave it a shot! LOL

The nigiri here was hit and miss...some great, some uninspiring and not quite as fresh tasting as I am used to, but the rolls were done well here!  I think this is gonna be a good place for the roll lovers...good presentation and taste...lots of depth and goodies hiding inside.

Baked Green Mussel with parmigiano in an Escargot style serving dish! Pretty good! Dare I say too cheesy??  It was a little difficult to eat, as the cheese melted together on top in a solid form, and I had to rip parts of cheese to eat with the mussels as they sat naked underneath, vs it being a melted goo of goodness.

I enjoyed the soft shell crab appetizer.  I think this was a \"one per guest\" kind of order item, but I definitely would have ordered two!

Service was good, especially considering the amount of people we had in our group!  i think they did forget one or two things I ordered, or they ended up on someone else's table, but I was getting too full enough to complain lol.

Took lots of pics!  See below :"}
{"text":"Yummy loved the food here.  Talk about fast service omg rolls were coming out as fast as we could order them. We had a group of 8 and everyone had a awesome time. The staff was friendly the got you drink refills in no time. All I have to say 5 stars all the way. Keep up the great work blue fin"}
{"text":"My experience with most AYCE sushi restaurants is that it's just average sushi, with subpar fish, & this place is no different. Their eel sauce is way too sweet making any roll it's served on taste like a desert roll, & I wasn't impressed by the quality of fish being served. I've definitely had worse, but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"There was no wait when we arrived, and no long wait for a server. I ordered just a few rolls, which were California and Spicy tuna. The spicy tuna was probably the best I ever had. I will come back just to order more of those. 
Prices are pretty normal.. $6 and up for rolls. 

Only thing that was a little confusing, were the servers. We had like 3 of them.. so when I left my tip, I am not sure who will get it. 

Me and my friend were there for like 2 hours just eating and talking. It was a great place for a date night or a great long conversation lol."}
{"text":"By far the best AYCE sushi in town. At least in my opinion. You can ask for custom hand rolls that are not ton the menu."}
{"text":"Unbelievable value. Fresh quality fish. You can order all you can eat from the entire menu for 22.00 at lunch and 26 bucks for dinner. I don't know how they make money. I had perfect tempura including a delicious soft shell crab, lots of sushi and a wonderful rainbow roll. Its spotless, friendly and they urge you to order more. They seem to enjoy you enjoying their food. I visit Las Vegas often and will always make it a point to come here again. I was there for dinner last night and went back for lunch today to see it it was as good as I thought it was. And it was. Don't hesitate to patronize.
Chuck"}
{"text":"Good food and great service,, it a small hole in the wall place, sushi and japanese food off the main menu and/or all you can eat for a nominal fee
$21.95 -lunch and a few $ more for dinner $25.95 which I believe includes the tax....Some rolls have cream sauce,which might be a little fattening on those who eat lightly.. Since it was not super crowded the food came out in a timely manner... When I was there ,there was 2 sushi chef and love the mochi ice cream dessert selections..mmm good,wish I could of ate more....sushi and mochi..."}
{"text":"Ate here again when back in Vegas and I must say I'm so embarrassed I took my mom here! I don't know what happened since our last visit here but it was awful this time and we won't be going back! Too bad we will just have to find another sushi spot when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Cozy, tasty, friendly and packed with value- I am not sure what more Blue Fin could do... oh wait, they were able to serve a party of 12 without issue! This is a rarity. Granted, it is a small restaurant, so if 5 entourages showed up, it might be a problem.

I am generally unable to get my value's worth from AYCE, so I ordered the scallop entree. However, glancing over the AYCE menu and witnessing the rolls that came to the table, their selection is slamming, not just spicy tuna and fried shrimp. 

If you are able to rustle up some of the chef's special creations, you will be in for a treat. We had a pile of tasty fish with truffle oil, and even my fish-picky taste buds approved whole-heartedly! The scallop entree was also a winner served on a bed of tasty vegetables with the perfect sweet marinade.

Service was super friendly and efficient, and the mochi was perfect. What more could ya want?"}
{"text":"Always have fresh fish (the nigiri pieces are huge).Unique flavors (unlike most sushi places where they have 2 signature flavors and it all ends up tasting the same) orange hinted rolls, bbq, coconut, lemon. All mixed with fresh fish, crab, crunch...etc. We have eaten here over a year on and off and have never had bad fish or service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Blue Fin in a couple of years.  The last time I went, I LOVED it...I thought it was better than my go to sushi place.

I went last night with some friends, and had a good experience.  Not spectacular, but pretty good.

The restaurant itself, is beautiful.  They've expanded since the last time I was in, and they now have a very large, spacious dining room, that is separate from the sushi bar area.  There are still tables near the bar, which is where we sat. 

We had a couple of servers taking care of us, and they were all polite, and very helpful.  

The prices for drinks are pretty good.  I had an iced green tea for $2.50 with free refills, and a small bottle of hot sake for $3.95.  My roommate had a LARGE bottle of beer for $6.95.  Not bad at all.  I could have had a large hot sake for only $2 more, but...I was trying to behave myself. ;)

Now...the fish!
My favorite specialty roll here, is the Royal Unagi (made without avocado).  Its a baked roll with eel, cream cheese, a bit of tempura, and eel sauce on top.  It was just as delicious as I remembered, only...SO rich!!I really really wish that they would do a half roll, but on the baked/deep fried rolls, they don't do halves.

The quality of the nigiri was good...not as consistantly good as Sushi Mon's but it was decent. My favorites of the night were:
The Spicy Garlic Tuna...for a girl who is NOT a fan of spicy, this was too much for me to have more than a piece of.  So why did I go back for thirds?  SO delicious...the flavor was incredible.  So incredible, that I didn't care how badly my mouth was on fire.  
The Unagi:  Perfect EVERY time.
The Ebi:  Really good...perfect texture.

From the appetizer menu, I LOVED the gyoza.  these were delicious!!  I'm a big gyoza fan, and really enjoyed these.

Everything else we tried  was good, but didn't blow me away. Super White, which is my absolute favorite was GREAT the first round, but the second round was \"meh.\"
Also, the rice fell apart quite a lot at the beginning of the meal.

I will say this, though, the service was great.  We sent two dishes back, and the only questions asked were simply quality control. 
One we sent back because it had a ton of creamy \"yum yum\" sauce, which is not mentioned on the menu...if it was, we wouldn't have ordered it (my friend has a texture thing with creamy sauces...and I didn't care for the texture.)  
The other we sent back, because my friend is pregnant, and the baby said \"NOPE!\" (Don't worry, her doctor said it was fine as long as the fish is cooked, and we triple checked everything with the servers.)

All in all, pretty good experience.  I've had better at Sushi Mon, but I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Thank you to the lovely Lisa L. for hosting a UYE here! I'm still not convinced with my appetite AYCE is the way to go (sushi - eating wise), but I really enjoyed my meal here!

The standout were the chef's special creations off the menu! He's very creative and great at putting flavors together. The one called \"Sianara Happy hour\" (or something like that) was AMAZING.

The yellowtail nigiri was fresh and tasty, but avoid the yellowtail in the Arizona rolls. The ahi poke was cool - a nice seaweed + poke mixture. Delish! Most of the rolls we tried were great - I'd probably recommend ordering with light sauce, many were too sweet and saucy for my taste. 

Fresh, creative and tasty - check it out for the AYCE !"}
{"text":"Favorite is Salmon, spicy garlic tuna, ikura, unagi.

Good: albacore

Try Cajun albacore, tobiko. The salmon is killer. Uni isn't that fresh though. Amaebi was a bit sour. Tbh, none of their one order per person was that great."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. The fish just tastes so damn fresh. All you can eat is the only way to go. The staff doesn't speak  much English but they are all pretty friendly. All you can eat Moc"}
{"text":"My fave sushi spot in this area of town! Everyone is so nice and their all you can eat is definitely worth it! They have a great variety of rolls including some with mango which is hard to find in some spots."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food. The drink menu isn't the best but the food is phenomenal and totally worth it. Scallops are to die for"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Great food and great service! I go back over and over! Chicken bento box is my favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here at least twice when I'm in town for work. Staff is awesome and the sushi chefs make some amazing rolls. Prices are affordable and lots of locals come and eat."}
{"text":"Seeing some negativity in these reviews is a bit shocking.  I have been going to blue fin for the better of 3 years now and each visit has been nothing short of a pleasant time.  I have never had trouble with their service and their sushi men and staff have always been extremely welcoming and friendly.  I have been to many sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and California and have still to find a place that I enjoy more than blue fin. Their rolls have combinations of sauces that make the rolls new and refreshing everything time, such as the Johnny Johnny.  Their salads are the best I've had and I that is coming from someone who never orders salad.  Their nigiri and fish they use have always been high quality and fresh. Some of the bigger names such as goymeon,janga, sushimon  lack this freshness and this high quality of fish and is one of the main reasons I continue to come back to blue fin. Being someone who has continuously been visiting bluefin I can confidently say I have yet to find a better ayce who provides overall freshness and a huge variety of rolls and appetizers that help top off the fish.  I would recommend blue fin to anyone who asks me for a sushi spot in the henderson or even las vegas area."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. Fantastic service. What else do you need? I think Blue Fin is my favorite sushi restaurant when I need a fix."}
{"text":"Really good sushi! So many places in Vegas have AYCE for around $25 which is awesome. I just make it my only meal for the day and then chow down. :) My Ukranian Canadian friend and I went to town while my sushi-hating boyfriend just sat there and drank his \"pop\". I had a couple Sapporos and fresh nigiri and interesting rolls. No sashimi is allowed for AYCE though because they want you to fill up on rice. Boo! Sashimi is my favorite. I probably would have given this place 5 stars if it had included sashimi. Dessert, however, was included - yum mochi ice cream! :D"}
{"text":"Enjoy stopping in for a quick lunch. I always do AYCE, they don't have much for AYCE but I'm pretty simple so I'm fine with what they have.

Love the Spicy Garlic Edamame it actually has a kick to it unlike other places. I'm more of a Sashimi/Nigiri girl so I can't tell you too much about rolls. 

Great customer service compared to other places and that's what keeps me coming back. I'll be back again soon, thank you guys!"}
{"text":"love love love... korean owned from Hawaii..  everything's fresh and flavorful.   love the tempura soft shell crab! I could eat dozens of them! crispy served with a tangy dressing and fried beets and carrots.  delicious!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Salmon collar and Hawaiian poki salad was excellent. Price was perfect for what I ate. They have wet and dry sushi. (wet sushi = lotta sauce = wet) not fond of wet sushi. but this was good. There dynamite and baked muscles is rich. 1 order is good for 2 people."}
{"text":"4.4 for sure. 

My husband and I were looking for a lunch spot near the Galaxy Green Valley theater and Yelp led us here.  

For an AYCE sushi place, Blue Fin definitely is above par.  I'm pretty sure if you googled \"cozy\" there'd be a link to this place.  It's quite quaint. There is a great selection and variety of  nigiri and clever sushi rolls. My husband does not like fish but loves veggie rolls. He was thrilled to see a baked veggie roll on the menu (he's never had one before). He loved it. 
I had salmon and hamachi sushi (my faves) and I also had the rock & roll and the blue fin special roll. All were delicious and all fresh.

The sushi chefs were extremely accommodating and courteous, and the wait staff were attentive. Service all around was great. The chefs also made a special off the menu veggie roll for my husband that he absolutely loved.

The big plus here, that sets it apart from standard AYCE places, is definitely the freshness and the variety.  I am absolutely coming back and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great AYCE spot."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The location is pretty convenient, and the parking is always a breeze. The decor is nice and rich. There is hardly ever a wait. Although seated fast and initially waited on fast, it's hard to get a continuous flow of good service. I think that's the only clink in their armor. The fish is nice and fresh, their super white tuna sushi is the bomb!!! The marinade is to die for! The rolls are all so yummy and the fish is cut just right. Try the lunch specials- you get miso soup, 5-7 pieces of nigiri, a spicy tuna roll, tossed salad, Mac salad, rice and teriyaki chicken!!! For $10!! I haven't tried the AYCE, but this will be my next go to."}
{"text":"Ahhh, i love the Vibe sitting around the quaint sushi bar even if some stuck up girls were there being stupid. But thats neither here nor there. The Alaskan roll is my favorite. And most places serve 6 pieces in a roll. Here its 8. And i love that i can do half rolls too. They kept me and my brothers drinks full, and quickly took away our empty trays. The Tvs with sport on is a nice touch, and its quiet enough to hold a conversation. The rolls come out quick and our delicious and not oversauced. They dont stuff them full of rice either. My last roll i split with my brother and they didnt fret because he did AYCE too. 

Go for the Tempura Ice Cream with Green Tea. Ohhh So delicious and filling. I shall be back. Thanks for great times."}
{"text":"We come to Blue Fin consistently for sushi, and have done so for years.  As the restaurant expanded, the service declined drastically.  Not the food, and not the chefs - those are the things that keep us coming back still.  It is the wait staff.

For the most part, the wait staff is pleasant.  However, almost every time we eat at Blue Fin, we have to wait a considerable amount of time for drinks if we are at the bar or service at all when sitting at a table.  

We are sitting here now, and we were finally asked for our next order after waiting ten minutes after our dish from the previous roll was cleared from our table.  Waiting a few minutes between orders is fine, but one of the servers was talking with some other customers during a long part of the wait FACING US AND MAKING EYE CONTACT. Seriously, just take a minute to make everyone happy instead of just certain customers.

So, this review would be five stars because the food and chefs really do rock, they just have to do something about the servers."}
{"text":"The first visit was a prelude to a grandiose love affair to come. Second visit with the Duchess, Lisa L., secures Blue Fin as a favorite. Both times, the service has been warm, friendly, and quick. 

Dining with Lisa L. was a great experience because I gave full ordering rights over to her. My only duty was to enjoy the opulent flavor combinations as they danced across my palate. The tako nigiri with a drizzle of sesame oil and a slice of lemon was fragrant and exquisite. The ika with some kind of leaf (was it sesame?) was another ambrosial blend of flavor. Finding a sushi lover that avoids rolls, cream cheese, mayo, while creating unique blends in nigiri was everything I could ask for. The only thing I disliked was my own fault. I have never liked mackerel, but was stubbornly wanting to give it another try at a different restaurant. Yep, over twenty different places and still not a fan. Tried it cooked, raw, Japanese style, Korean style, in several different countries. Safe to say it will not be part of my diet. Yellow tail belly, on the other hand, is perfection. Kevin P., be prepared, it might get heated if it comes to a battle for this fatty cut. 

To eat with someone who enjoys the slow dining experience has greatly deepen my love for each individual fish. No more placing eight orders in at once and swallowing it down. A relaxed pace is needed to allow for moments of appreciation. The two and a half hours went by in a blink of an eye. Instead of feeling bloated and unable to move, their was a feeling of fulfillment from food and company."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch. It's close to work and is easy to get to. I have eaten in and taken out and have had quick, friendly service every time. I just get the lunch specials ($8-ish) so I haven't ventured outside of that section of menu, which is kind of boring but I'm happy with getting any kind of decent sushi. I got the Tempura Veggies once and they were a bit greasy so I have avoided them since. The restaurant is clean. I will continue to eat here, someday I will try something on the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Blue Fin Sushi.  The Yelp reviews were so good I thought that it would be great having it so close to home.

At first glance it was perfect.  No wait, chatty and friendly sushi chefs, nice clean restaurant with no obnoxious music blasting.  The sushi came out and it was beautiful, little works of art.

But when it came time to eat ... it just wasn't there.  The sauces were cloying and over used, drowning the taste of fish.  There were bones in my nigiri.  The dishes were also inconsistent from chef to chef.

I'll come back if I'm in the area and don't feel like driving but I won't be making any special trips when there are better sushi places just a couple miles away."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi in a nice space. Very friendly and attentive waiter. Made suggestions and offered advise on items. BUT the rolls had so much sauce on them that they masked the taste of the fish. It was hard to eat because they were soooo sweet. The sushi itself was good but once again they added ingredients that took away from the fish. Next nothing with any sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly this was not my favorite sushi place! I am huge on sushi and have heard great things about this place but for me the flavors did not mix well. Most of the rolls were presented very well. The best part about this place is unlimited mochi ice cream. I had 6, so I will give 4 starts. But to be completely honest this place is average and nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter for a quick meal and we had no wait time. The service was quick and the so was the food. The place was cute inside too. I only give 3 stars because I tried this place twice and both times it was just ok. Definitely not bad but also not OMG it is so good!"}
{"text":"So this is the first time I have checked in here through yelp but I used to be a regular here. It's been over a year since we have eaten here so we decided to give it a go again. 

Upon walking in we were greeted and sat at our table. The first thing I noticed was that the menus were updated. 

We ordered our appetizers, soft shelled crab and screaming O. Both were meh, I think the screaming O has too much sauce. If they go a little lighter on it, it would be delicious. 

Next we ordered the baked bay scallops but when those came it they were drenched in bacon and cheese. We sent it back because we thought it was incorrect but it wasn't? Which was confusing cause there were bacon scallops on the appetizer list as well. 

We moved onto the Nigiri Sushi and that was SO GOOD! We ordered the garlic tuna, spicy garlic tuna, and super white tuna. Do yourself a favor and try all of those, the super white tuna is the best! Like melt in your mouth best!! 

I then ordered my go to sushi, Uni. It was awful, I had high hopes for it. I ate one piece and sent the rest back. They looked slimy and dark and they had a smell to them when they got to the table. I typically judge a sushi establishment by their uni, they failed. It was not fresh at all. 

After the Uni, I was over it, I ordered a miso soup and then mochi. 

The service is good, they are attentive and our server was very pleasant. The restaurant is clean and not very noisy. The update to the menu was cool and the nigiri was delicious. Taking away two stars for the Uni, that should be something that is FRESH FRESH FRESH!

As we were leaving we did see a truck delivering fish and the box said Hawaii on it. Was cool seeing that they actually eat fresh fish, just disappointed with the Uni."}
{"text":"Showing restraint when I have AYCE sushi for lunch is difficult but I've been getting better. I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and I had sampled enough nigiri to be satisfied but I didn't fill myself up too much where I couldn't finish the rest of the day. The fish and rice were delicious and service at the sushi bar was just fine even though the chef was busy during the middle of the lunch hour.

There were only 4 seats left at the sushi bar when I arrived at noon and the dining room was about 75% full which means the place is full at peak times and I will plan accordingly for the next visit. The sushi chef was attentive making sure to make eye contact with me every few minutes to assure I was getting a steady flow of food. He did a great job of remembering 4 or 5 orders at a time. Although he did forget to make an order of unagi for my last order, but that was OK because I was starting to get full. The servers also did a good job of removing plates but I had to spend a couple of minutes to track one down for my check.

The nigiri and hand rolls I had were my standard and Blue Fin passed the initial test. Mackerel usually isn't a regular order for me but I ordered it here and it was actually the best cut of fish I had. It's usually a little to oily and funky smelling, but this mackerel had none of that going on.

Lunch is $22 and dinner is $26. There's a section on the menu dedicated to shrimp tempura rolls and the appetizer section has the usual players. Everything was good enough where I'll return and there won't be anything to hold me back from trying everything."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 3 star cuz the Eal sause is not from scratch big rolls the chef dint give me any special all average ,they need to fix the poke tuna salad is good huge big soup plate full off sea weed jajapeño more weed way to big and littel tuna, i order the Goyaman roll was to compres hard ard cucumber salad big chunks no sliced very hard whats that i like my rolls soft no no return, good luck with you restaurant plus you over charge me, overoll one more sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Yucky. That may be a bit ineloquent, but everything from the awkward service to the quality of the rolls was just that: yuk. 

We walk in and are seated, and then, not even two minutes later, as we're still perusing the menu, we get asked if we're ready to order....what? I was so confused, and felt a little pressed. Not cool. And they did this twice!! Then when menus were set aside after a few minutes, I remember sitting there looking around after a couple minutes passed by trying to make eye contact with a server. I guess the staff that day isn't good at reading service cues...but they seemed pretty upbeat, I guess. Idk. Just awkward.

Flash on over to the food. Boyfriend got the Happy Ending roll, which was okay. Lots of flavor going on to the point of overwhelming the palate in just a bite, and then your mouth is covered in cream cheese. I wasn't a fan. He didn't finish it. 

I ordered the rainbow roll, and again, it was alright. Nothing to shout about. I also made the mistake of ordering the spicy yellowtail roll...it was chewy. Emphasis on ew. I ate most of the rainbow roll and had a couple pieces of the yellowtail to be sure (even had boyfriend have a bite to be sure! Said the same thing.) because I was starving, but didn't finish it either. I can't imagine doing the \"all you can eat\" there.

Pretty disappointing and awkward experience. I guess this place is a gamble! *Pun so totally intended*"}
{"text":"My 3rd AYCE sushi!!!! I say this with enthusiasm due to the fact I've never eaten sushi till I've moved to Vegas. 

I think my favorite thing about this location is allowing half rolls. I don't eat the raw sushi just yet, so baked rolls is usually where I lean. Have you had 3 trays of full baked rolls? That stuff fills you up so fast that breathing is no longer an option. Breathing isn't that important right? 

If you're curious, here's what I ordered. Along with full prices.

Shrimp tempura 20.85
Ahi poke 8.95
Royal Mexican 12
Dragon 11
Spicy garlic 4
Tuna crab cake 6.95
Calamari 5.95
Shumai 4.95
Spider 10.50
Sweetheart 11
Nigiri: unagi 4.75, cajun albacore 4.25, 
garlic tuna 4.25
Cucumber salad 3.95
Miso soup 2
Mango mania 12
Caterpillar 11
Tokyo express 13
Veggie tempura 6.95
Royal California 6.50
Gangnam style 13
Strawberry jubilee 4.95
Tempura green tea 4.95

$25 AYCE. Worth it!

With great food, comes great staff. The hostess, server and even the manager (who brought us several orders himself) were great!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night for the first time. Overall the experience was good for an almost completely packed house. Okay just kidding, almost every seat was filled. The nigiri we had were good, but there was this really salty sauce they used on some of them (the walu would have tasted so much better without it in my opinion). The ahi poki salad was really good here even though it seemed a bit skimpy on the tuna, but maybeee that's because we were doing AYCE. The place was really busy, so when the waitress asked if we were ready for another round, we had to tell her a couple of times that we were still waiting on orders. I don't recall her name but she was superrrrr nice. Considering on going back on a less busier night."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Met my Vegas buddies for all you can eat before our poker game. Great, great food. We ordered all the great stuff, too much to remember. Excellent value, along with some beer and saki we rolled out of there. It's in a strip mall in a non-descript part of town, but go. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice now and done the All you can eat sushi both times. The first time which was probably about a year ago, we walked out unimpressed. We have eaten at several other AYCE sushi across the Las Vegas valley and this one didn't stack up to the others. HOWEVER, my second try, yesterday, it was AMAZING. It was a Saturday night and busy but we got a table right away. The bus boys and water boys were amazing and super fast. I can't say the same about our waitress. She was a little slow but I tend to expect that on a Saturday night. They have a wonderful selection of sushi you can order and everything tasted wonderful. They have beer specials for $3 too. We will definitely be going back and hope our next experience is as good as this last one."}
{"text":"I have driven past Blue Fin many times and never realizing it.  We finally, after hearing great things, decided to give it a try.  So, we met a couple of friends for dinner and grabbed a table.  I like the feel of Blue Fin as you walk in.  We were in the first section, not near the bar.  So, we didn't have the bar experience, which I have grown accustomed to.  But, the service was quick and friendly.  I like the menu a lot, and was able to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I am still a sushi rookie, but I kind of know what I am looking for in a good roll.

The first thing we ordered was the poke.  I had a couple of pieces but, it's not my thing.  Everyone else at the table loved it.  Anyhow, we started to order rolls after rolls.  Now, I don't know the names, but know that they were good.  Screaming O's, spicy tuna, and a roll that I will probably crave for a while now, that had guacamole.  It seemed every roll came out looking amazing and tasting even better.  

We also had an interesting experience, and no fault at all to Blue Fin, a customer must have had a little too much Sake and was puking her guts up in the bathroom.  But, as soon as she was finished the staff went in quickly to clean up and sanitize everything.

So, I'm sure we will definitely be back.  Great location, prices, sushi and service."}
{"text":"Best hamachi I've had. Their white tiger roll is pretty amazing too. All their ingredients are fresh and I am never disappointed here. The sushi chefs are friendly and funny, and the waitstaff is great. Try the Mexican for a change of pace!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in the city. Good price for all you can eat and it comes fast and fresh. I can eat forever, but the one hour all you can eat is stopping me hahaha. Overall very good sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Lived here for going on 11 years, and it's still the best. I've been over 20 times (I'm not kidding) and the food is just as great, if not better, than the last time."}
{"text":"Great service I felt very well taken care of!  And pretty good sushi rolls. Average pricing for sushi! I would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This was one of a few restaurants I visited before I moved from the area, and this review is more of a 3.5 stars.

My mother was in the mood for sushi and I talked her into going here instead of Oyishi.  While I don't get to do sushi often due to my husband not wanting anything to do with food that is remotely fishy, I wanted to try Blue Fin because I knew the chances of me going out of the way to go here from another part of town was pretty remote.

I prefer hand rolls and sashimi/nigiri mostly so I went in that direction, as many of their regular rolls did not seem that appealing to me, and found the fish to be fairly fresh and tasty.  However, compared to my previous AYCE excursion at Oyishi, I found that Blue Fin goes heavier on the rice, which I was not fond of.  There was also some issues with ordering, and a few times when we ordered one item, we received another item.

I do want to also give them props on their salads and their teriyaki chicken.  The seaweed salad was one of the freshest salads I have had in the area, and the chicken was the best I have had so far from the AYCE joints.  I was not happy with the teriyaki beef and how heavily breaded the soft shell crab was, and found many of their hot items just okay.

I wouldn't go out of my way for sushi in general here, as my favorite is still Spicy Tuna, but for AYCE, but I found it to be pretty good with some hits and misses."}
{"text":"I had a great experience once again at Blue Fin Sushi & Roll!  I was having an AYCE with yelpers a while ago hosted by Lisa L. and loved the quality of their fish. I am so glad that I came back to Blue Fin the other night and had a delicious \"Sashimi Salad\". It was a very big portion but I finished it all :p )  I love salmon and some of the sashimi salmon on my plate were from Alaska and the server wanted me to know before tasting .  It was very tender and rich in flavors!  My dinner was $16 and enough for me to fulfill my tummy. Everyone was very friendly and I had an outstanding service by attentive server. All the employees recognized me somehow(even though I've been there only once).  There is no doubt  in my mind that I am going back to Blue Fin & have some great meals!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Had great buy 2 get 1 free house sake special. Great price for ayce lunch sushi $21. The cooks were very nice and served our dishes fast and with a smile. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of AYCE as I have yet to find a place that can maintain quality ingredients, quality presentation, and creativity at the AYCE price.  Blue Fin tries but still falls short of perfection.  The fish is fresh but inconsistent.  The rolls I tried (Crazy Yum Yum, Dragon, and Grand Canyon????.  They were good but the CYY was drowned in a spicy sauce and you couldn't get the fish flavors while the Dragon was bland.  The softshell crab was good and there is plenty of choices on the menu, even sweet shrimp which is often extra on an AYCE menu is included!

The place was packed for a uye so the questionable service we received (it took 45 minutes to get our food while people who ordered after us received theirs in minutes) and harried staff can be partly excused.

I will go back on a less crowded time and hopefully have a better experience.  I agree with past reviewers that for an AYCE this is above average but as most AYCE places do, it  is just a step down of tje quality and consistency I want from sushi."}
{"text":"Place fucking sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jk favorite sushi ever"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite. My husband and I have lived in Portland and San Francisco, so our sushi standards are pretty high. 

The place is a quaint little sushi place. Their lunch AYCE is $21.99 pp. The rolls are huge!!! Look carefully at the menu and decide if it will be worth it before you decide on the AYCE price. 

Friendly staff, fresh food, cute place. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Blue fin sushi is very good for lunch. Sushi is fresh. Restaurant is clean and service was good. Not sure if their AC wasn't working but just seemed to be very hot inside the restaurant, which is why I only rate 4 stars. I don't wanna have to be fanning my self with a menu..."}
{"text":"Baked mussels are awesome here! Also liked screaming orgasm as an appetizer. Ahi poke tuna was too spicy, a lot of halapeno slices in it. 
I am not a big fan of wasabi, guess it is an authentic japanese kitchen, but it is in every piece of sushi... On top of rice, hidden under the fish. 
Great service! Nigori sake overpriced."}
{"text":"I recently tried Blue Fin Sushi all you can eat menu after a friend recommended it and I'm glad I did! Everyone was so attentive and nice. The god tasted amazing! Everything we got from rolls to fried rolls, potstickers, baked rolls, and drinks were all amazing and the presentation is to die for. The staff makes sure to let you know that if you're ordering a baked or fried roll that it will take a little while and suggest lighter half rolls while you wait. It is a little small so when they're busy is does seem to get a little loud but it's a great atmosphere overall. I'll definitely be back more often to fulfill my sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi places I have been too. Their fish is not fresh and it tastes like dirt in a very weird way... Made me nauseous"}
{"text":"Me and my husband usually eat here when he is in the mood for \"all you can eat\" sushi. They did some expanding/renovating into the next suite which makes dining in a bit more comfortable than when we first starting coming here a few years ago. I do get a bit annoyed that they assume that everyone who dines in will be getting the \"all you can eat\" and do not distribute dinner menus until they are asked for. Especially more annoying when my 4 year old joins us, really, because she is going to get \"all you can eat\"? The sushi is good, not the greatest I've ever had, however definitely worth the prices of the \"all you can eat'. Service is usually prompt, however on my most recent visit, i waited unusually long to receive a California roll (Al la cart) and my husband had already received a full round of his \"all you can eat\" order. They do offer specials, so if you are not seated where you can see the board, check with your waiter to see what those are for the day. I would recommend that large groups call ahead for seating arrangements since most of the tables are equipped for a party of 4-6 people and keep in mind that the bar area is a little smaller than you would expect, so table seating may be able to get you in/out more quickly."}
{"text":"Cant beat the price and the quality of service and food. Open late and the selection is quite impressive for AYCE added to their menu."}
{"text":"I usually order carry out here but decided to try their AYCE. It's about $27 for dinner. Customer service was great. Very attentive staff. They have a pretty good selection on their menu. I'm sure I ordered my money's worth. I usually stick to nigiri and appetizers. I tried their dragon roll and the eel sauce was just a bad consistency. It was thick and just gloop. Everything else tasted good though"}
{"text":"I came here around 6pm on a Sunday night. It has a dining area in the front, then as you walk to the back there are some tables and the sushi bar. I had a seat at the bar and was given a menu to peruse the offerings. You can get AYCE (60 minute time limit) for $25.95, but I choose a la carte because I'm a 2 roll max kind of person.

Its nicely decorated and clean. Service was good. The sushi, however, wasn't all that great. I had a Philly roll and the Blue Fin Lasagna. The Philly had a weird taste that even destroyed the taste of my Sapporo beer. The Blue Fin is a baked roll, that when served wasn't even warm. It tasted good, just seemed like the toaster oven didn't work too well. 

Maybe I'm spoiled because I have been to Yummy so many times and that is the best sushi in town. This was just ok. I'll probably stop in again and try some other items because its close by, but I wasn't wow'd."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town by far. Super fresh fish, excellent service, and friendly staff. My go-to sushi when i'm in vegas. The nigiri is melt in your mouth and super fresh. The rolls are amazing too. My favorite is the volcano roll. Oh and try the tuna poke salad, it is the best i've ever had."}
{"text":"Damn.  I traveled over 20 minutes to get to this side of town and was damn excited to try a new sushi joint offering AYCE.  Every aspect of my wanting to come here were supported by the fact that 1.) I was starving and working up quite an appetite, 2.) was encouraged by all the yelp reviews and outstanding 4.5 star rating, and 3.) the pictures were freaking enticing; it definitely played a role in my excitement and subtle impatience for dining here.

Now, I haven't yelped in a while but felt the need to write about my experience because I was horribly disappointed.  You can't imagine my despair upon leaving that restaurant.  As I mentioned before, I was really saving my appetite for their AYCE so I made sure not to eat anything  beforehand.  My group ordered some of their appetizers but focused mainly on nigiri.  We weren't shy about what we wanted and ordered everything almost instantly after being sat.

Let the disappointment begin.... Our first dish was their seaweed salad.  I was taken back a bit because the color of the seaweed almost blinded me with its bright ass neon green.  It looked really artificial and not appetizing.  Moreover, it was overwhelmingly spicy and this coming from a person who's all about spice.  Now, onto more important things, the nigiri was \".....\", i'm speechless.  Imagine a thin slice of fish served on top of a fat ass pile of overcooked, terribly seasoned, almost inedible rice.  I was beating myself up for ordering that much nigiri, knowing that I couldn't even eat the rice accompanied with it.  I almost died and by the end of the meal we were literally forcing each piece down our throat.  I just threw up a little thinking about it.  YUCK!!  This was by far my worst AYCE experience, ever!  To top it off, the pictures that were posted by fellow yelpers were no where to be found on the menu.  I was so bummed out about that....

Let's sum things up: service was friendly and attentive, although there were only two other tables dining as well.  The fish was of okay quality, it was good but not good enough for me to go out of my way and certainly not good enough to go through the hell of forcing myself to chow down the rice it comes with!!!!  I can't stress this enough and I cant imagine how other yelpers don't find this bothersome or even acceptable for sushi, but the amount of rice they pile on each piece of nigiri is freaking ridonkulous!!  I'm sure it's maybe their strategic way of stuffening you up quick, but damn they're not shy about it and are definitely not subtle!  This place is a no go!  I'm more pissed off about the gas I used to take me there... there goes $10 i'll never see again. blah."}
{"text":"Amazing food. All you can eat makes it a fantastic value."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been to in Vegas. The service is great, great environment, and amazing food. The all-you-can-eat sushi option is probably the best value. Definitely worth checking out! :)"}
{"text":"***December 1, 2011 UYE ***

Well, here goes a review on fine sushi from a novice sushi reviewer!  It is based on the impromptu UYE that followed the kickoff of \"Shop Local!\" at Sunshine Coffee where a number of hungry Yelpers decided to go for AYCE sushi after the kickoff ended.  I didn't know what to expect but I had heard that the sushi here was one of the best in the city.  It did not disappoint!

I love Miso Soup, so even though it is filling, I ordered a bowl and was pleased to hear that it, too, is considered part of AYCE here.  In fact, unlike some of my savvy tablemates, I did not realize until I read Holly C.'s review after the event that unlimited desserts were included, as well.  But, my stomach hardly had room anyway after I finished my refreshing Mango Mochi at meal's end.  

I didn't count them, but our table likely consumed close to 20 rolls before we split, plus a few other odds and ends like Raw Tuna Poki Salad and Calamari Tempura.  I positioned myself next to Tony T., so I had someone to translate the offerings and describe the ingredients of each foreign batch that arrived.  The Miso Soup was good but overly salty.  Ahi Tuna was smooth, cool, and richly flavored.  The Rainbow Roll was excellent, as was the Tokyo Express that contained a mixture of tuna and salmon on each large cut-roll piece.  The Italian Special was good and creamy.  I even liked the Crazy Yum Yum for a time, but after awhile the very mayonnaisey (Holly's word) sauce became cloying.  Tubiko I found to just taste okay, but the red and green fish eggs were certainly pretty and helped usher in the Christmas holiday spirit on this first day of December.  As many avocado lovers know, avocado can vary in consistency, color, and taste, depending on how ripe it is.  Here every roll that included a slice of avocado offered non-stop delicious bites of  perfectly ripe and green avocado entwined with the raw fish.  Cool and tasty every time!  

I didn't love it but found the Salmon Roe to be better tasting than the Flying Fish Eggs.  Calamari Tempura was different than Calamari Fritti but good in a more subdued way.  I tried to stretch beyond sushi that was safe and mild like the California Roll (which no one ordered), and succeeded to a degree, but found that I still had my limits on what I would put in my mouth.  I regarded the Amaebi (sweet shrimp) with fried heads quite skeptically, although the shrimp part of the dish glistened and beckoned to me, so that I developed a slight interest in it.  And, after being coaxed by Tony T. and Lisa L. to try this weird-looking dish, I finally acquiesced halfway and chewed on the raw shrimp.  Surprisingly, I found it to be tasty and somewhat creamy in texture.  But, I stopped there.  I'm not yet ready for fried shrimp heads.  

My stomach also turned as I faced a dish that featured a quail egg nestled next to what looked like brown brains.  I continued to only look, and let my fellow diners enjoy whatever this sushi beast was.  When I was almost full, I realized that I had forgotten to order my favorite sushi: a Spicy Tuna Roll.  So, not to piggishly over-order and leave anything behind, I asked for and received a half-order of Spicy Tuna Roll.  It was as spicy as I recall previously experiencing from a Spicy Tuna Roll, to the point that my nostrils felt like they were smoking, and I had to modulate the spice with a bite from a much milder Caterpillar Roll before I launched in again for more bites of the super-spicy roll.  I did finish all of it eventually.

I believe everyone present had a good time.  We did converse, but almost exclusively about the wonderful sushi spread before us that kept coming and coming until we called it off.  We were all there principally to eat, and that we did!"}
{"text":"Tried the AYCE for the first time last week with a friend. Trying a new sushi place is always scary, but Blue Fin didn't disappoint! 

They Cajun albacore nigri was my favorite nigri on the menu. I also enjoyed the super white tuna! Fresh and full of flavor!

As far as rolls go, they have a very diverse selection.  One of my favorite rolls was the \"Sunset\" roll. The service was great and I liked that the place was small and cozy! I would recommend this place to all sushi lovers! I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant. They are friendly and welcoming to solo diners, which is always a plus for me. Very clean and a nice ambience. Tonight I had the cucumber salad and the Over the Rainbow roll with a lovely glass of Pinot Grigio. The roll was delightfully fresh. A perfect dinner! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place for good sushi! I haven't been able to find a good sushi place in the valley that didn't cost an arm and a leg until last night when a friend took us to Blue Fin. Me and three friends were able to stuff ourselves full of sushi and sake for about $100! That's hard to do since we can really put away a lot of sushi. 
When you walk in it doesn't look like much. It's a pretty small place with only a few tables inside but they also have a patio area that can seat quite a few few people. The sushi was amazing and the service was prompt and friendly. They also have AYCE! Which is what I'll be doing next time for sure! I can't fin anything bad with this place at all! And I'm usually pretty critical. This place was so good I think I might have to go back again today."}
{"text":"Finally was able to go and give the much recommended Blue Fin Sushi on the SE side of Las Vegas a try.  I was there because of an UYE Lunch event hosted by Jessica R, plus also in attendance was Lisa L who organized the last UYE dinner event there. And it was totally worth skipping the free meal at Aria's employee dining and shelling out the $25.95 (dinner AYCE price, because I wanted to order the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama that is only available during dinner AYCE).  Not only was the food we ordered as good as I imagined it to be, Chef Jin (the chef/proprietor of Blue Fin) also made some special (off menu?) treats for us. 

The \"Shiso Special\" would make an excellent amuse-bouche at much fancier restaurants up and down the Strip. It is diced sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) flavored with fresh herbs, sesame seeds, Chef's secret sauce, covered with fried shiso leaf, garnished with masago (red, and green), ikura (salmon roe), and truffle oil. 

To start off the meal, we ordered a lot of nigiri (yellowtails, salmon, uni, amaebi, halibut, red snapper, bunch of spicy tuna and hamachi hand rolls), and Chef Jin hooked us all up with Yellowtail Belly (not part of the regular AYCE menu).  All the sushi were fresh and delicious. Our waitress did her best to try and take orders from all five of us, and some of the items we tried to order was left out, but it was no biggie. The food we were served were great and we ordered more in our second round.

Recommendation:  If you go for AYCE, even during lunch (11am-3pm), and you enjoy uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp) or hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), it is worth it to pay the few extra dollars for the dinner AYCE price and be able to order those item.

The restaurant is relatively small, so if you plan to go with a group it is best to call ahead and make a reservation.

The iced green tea looks great and is probably healthier than plain iced water.

Come hungry for AYCE :)

Rating breakdown:
Service - good
Food - excellent
Ambiance - nice, plays cool musics (some 80s) but not of Japanese artists.
Interior - clean, limited seating.
Price - about what most other AYCE Sushi restaurants charges.
Location - great for those living in the SE Las Vegas or near UNLV, but worth the drive if you live in other parts of Las Vegas.
  -  Out of Town Visitors - It is worth it to rent a car if you plan to venture off Strip to this sushi restaurant. Your cab fare back and forth would probably be more than 1 day's rental rate.

I feel this restaurant really earned a 4.5 Yelp Stars in my book.  And next time I will see if Chef Jin needs anyone to stage at his restaurant, because I would enjoy learning from him."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place. Wonderful service, comfortable atmosphere, and artfully crafted food. I guess if I had to say anything bad it's that their men's bathroom door handle is always loose and awkward to close, but honestly I couldn't give a shit (pun intended). Anyone who loves sushi will love blue fin

P.S. : try the gangam style roll. It's so good it hurts."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Fast service!! The all you can eat is a great value!! We had so much fun trying out new rolls. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for ages, so hopefully I didn't just have expectations that were too high.

We came here today because my fella was craving some sushi. I insisted we skip our favorite AYCE sushi, Goyemon to try this place across town. From the first bite, my fella was disappointed. After every bite I got that look from him like, \"see, we should have gone to Goyemon,\" I enjoy sushi rice, but this was just so overwhelmingly vinegary. It's the only flavor we could taste. I like to taste the flavor of the fish, but all I got was overwhelming flavor of vinegar in every single bite. I was very disappointed. 

I ordered a little of everything. Plenty of nigiri, salmon skin handroll, green mussels, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, tempura calamari and a few other items that I can't remember. The seaweed salad was really sour and not my favorite version I've ever had. The salmon skin handroll was pretty good. I like the salmon quite a bit, that's usually one of my favorite things to order at every sushi place. The only thing that was annoying was how flimsy the handrollls were put together. They fell apart so quickly and made a total mess. The calamari, tofu and mussels were all pretty tasty, although I prefer my mussels in the shell. I would order all three of those again. All the nigiri was fresh and really good, but I had to dab each one to remove excess vinegar from atop it, to make it more palatable. The desserts were pretty good. My fella felt vindicated a little when he ate the tempura ice cream with green tea ice cream and then quickly ordered another to finish up the meal.

Service was pleasant and efficient. I hope this was a one off for this resataurant, since I see so many great reviews from Yelpers I respect."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 arrived here at 1:30 on a Thursday for lunch.  Looked forward to a nice AYCE from the reviews.  Nice to see the place was busy.  
We were seated and waited 20 minutes before walking out   
No one ever approached our table. Two folks were seated after us and made it to drinks and salad - we didn't get a \"hi, I'll be right with you\"
Granted the servers seemed to be moving but not even an acknowledgement!?!  
The greeter/cashier watched us walk out without even saying a word."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  All you can eat, but eat fast!  There is a one hour time limit.
Have a saki bomb with it.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Easily the best AYCE I've been to in Vegas so far, and that title comes at the price of many nights of mediocre cuisine and frustration. 

The nigiri is exceptionally fresh and tasty. The sushi rice is well vinegared, tasty, and the rice to fish ratio is superb. I was a huge fan of the super white tuna, which was just fresh and clean in taste, and the unagi, which was this delicious sear on the outside so it had a yummy crunch to it. 

The rolls were exceptional as well. I love that they do half rolls of almost everything. Descriptions are very accurate, and again, the rice to fish ratio is excellent. The rolls aren't rice heavy and each one was tasty. 

The baked mussels were delish and came in a cute little dish that had a spot for each mussel (minor detail, but I loved the dish). And the ahi poke was on point. Also, all our servers spoke English and were able to tell us what each item was accurately, unlike some places I've been to. 

I can't wait to go back! This is definitely a place I'll recommend to friends without hesitation."}
