{"text":"Disappointed as this place had such great reviews and was highly recommended. Our Avocado roll was not fresh, the avocado was brown with a bit of green... We had a tuna roll that was mushy which is a good indicator that the fish was frozen and thawed and for raw meat I am not sure if that sits well with me. Tuna should be dark in colour and should should be firm. We also ordered a crispy spicy tuna and there was no crisp that I could tell but the sauce on top was nice. Our last roll was a dynamite roll which was okay but nothing spectacular..
I don't think I would give this one another go."}
{"text":"I recently visited this place for the second time this weekend. I brought all my friends and they were thoroughly impressed. Even the few friends that don't particularly love sushi. 

There menu offers a lot of selection, and everything I've tried so far has been delicious- especially the Hell Roll. This place goes in my top three sushi restaurants. The sauces, presentation, and overall freshness of the sushi of the sushi is what elevated this place to be in my top three sushi restaurants. 

Be warned of their hours, they close at 2pm, and then reopen at 5pm. However, we went there at 1:40 and we were served and out the door by 2:20. Service is a tad slow when it is busy, because there only is one waitress. 

The place is reasonably priced, and one specialty roll will typically set you back ~$13. 
If you are looking to discover a new sushi place, I would definitely give Ichi Rock a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it was great when it first opened and it has only gotten better as time goes on.  Delicious and -fresh- sashimi (and they always seem to give us such amazingly huge portions!), friendly staff, and a nice atmosphere inside the restaurant.  I haven't actually eaten in at Ichi Rock yet, but have gotten take out at least a dozen times if not more.

Faves:  Veggie freak roll, amazing korokke, fantastic agedashi tofu.  All of their special rolls are pretty much perfection, in my opinion.  I would definitely recommend giving Ichi Rock a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced for the ambiance, quality of food and overall experience.  There was barely anyone in the restoration on a Saturday night, which is a bad sign.  However, I gave them the benefit of doubt and tried the place for dinner.  Ended up spending $24 for a meal that should not cost more than $15.  The quality of food, presentation on the plate was poor.  Serving was decent, but that does not compensate for poor everything.  The ambiance was poorly done for a place that is charging $15 for fried rice."}
{"text":"ETA 2015: New hot food menu not as extensive and authentic as previous. Disappointing. Still a good time but definitely no longer my go-to Japanese restaurant.

With one of the most authentic Japanese menus in Calgary, Ichi Rock's greatest strength is its hot food and Izakaya (\"pub\") style food. Large variety of delicious things on sticks, Takoyaki, various noodle dishes and hot plates, and even slightly more obscure Japanese fare like tako-wasabi and mochi-wrapped ice cream for dessert.
The sushi is as fresh as you can get in Calgary, and good quality. Decore and ambiance are pretty great for a tiny restaurant.
Ichi Rock is also notable as being open until midnight or later (sushi bar closes at 10) which makes it a prime destination for late night noms. I bring friends and visitors (some native Japanese) here all the time and we've always enjoyed our experience.
The only thing I cannot recommend was the Okonomiyaki which was rather bland."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this little place. I stopped in with a cowoker for a late lunch. I opted for the sushi combo and he got the maki combo. 

Our plates arrived and the presentation was beautiful!  I didnt know where to start. It turns out that didnt matter because everything was tasty and well made. The combos had good sized portions and the price was reasonable, especially for downtown. I felt like our meals were made with care and there really were a lot of options to choose from. Sushi, sashimi, rolls or cones...it was all great.

The service was fast and friendly. I was really impressed with our server and how polite she was. She checked in with us just frequently enough to make sure we were taken care of.

Ichi Rock has now found a place in my lunch location rotation!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my order was rather unfortunate given that most of the happy reviewers here seem to like the ramen, but I ordered barbecue pork belly at this restaurant and it was simply not pork belly. Pork belly is supposed to have alternating layers of fatty and lean meat, but what turned up was completely lean pork! (I've bought pork shoulder at supermarkets that have a higher percentage of fat, not to mention pork belly.) Needless to say, lean pork does not lend itself very well to barbecue as it turned out dry and tough."}
{"text":"Sushi was very fresh, and tasted great.  Definitely some of my favorite Calgary sushi!  Also, the service was very friendly and on time.  I'm going to go again, and you should go too!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place that is humble and youthful/modern. 

It's owned by a Japanese man who has a Korean wife. Aki is the sushi chef 95% of the time and he does amazing sushi. The rice is what makes the difference and the portion sizes of the rolls are right on. Good food for fair pricing in my opinion. Would much rather spend $35/person here (and be really full) than the same money at an all you can eat at some shitty Chinese run Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"The only thing I m pretty sure is this is absolutely not the best ramen in Calgary. Terrible. Too much salt in the soup. Disaster!"}
{"text":"Ichi Rock aka Ichi [ra:ku] is a fusion japanese & izakaya style restaurant. I've been there a few times off a recommendation from a close friend of mine and I don't regret it at all.

This restaurant is not particularly large in size but that's how I prefer my restaurants to be. Situated in the west end of downtown it's cozy inside and you can tell special attention to detail was done when designing the interior of the place.

The waitresses are super nice, very accommodating although sometimes you might have to repeat some things to them (english as their second language) they are fairly quick from taking the order to serving the food.

I believe the only downside is when my friends and I usually go here that there will always be one thing that isn't being served or has run out, partially probably our fault as we hardly make it down there before 8pm. 

With that in mind the waitresses are awesome in the fact that we always end up getting a couple bonus items as their appreciation that we eat at their restaurant and a sincere form of apology that they don't have an item we wanted in our order.

I'd recommend this place to other people definitely!"}
{"text":"The short version? Go, enjoy some of the finest sushi in town (they have absolutely no fear in running out, even around dinner time, which means super-fresh sushi), the most fun staff (especially Aki, who is one of the friendliest Itamae that I have ever met in my life) and the most modern in decor.

The long version? Truthfully, As far as sushi in Calgary goes, you will be hard pressed to find a restaurant that is all in all better. IchiRock brings sushi that results in art, savory food and excellent service to Calgary. Some people I know have complained that you sometimes have to repeat yourself a couple of times for the servers, since English is not their first language I do not mind! Especially considering I never manage to have servers understand me the first time when I say \"Asahi\"...

I always get the spider roll here, always! It is easily the best I have had this side of the pacific, a must in my books. As for everything else? I will repeatedly go back, for everything else. From the creative textures and flavors of the appetizers to the quality and portion size of the toro, I cannot complain about anything.

As far as I am concerned, five stars describes it. All in all, I find no real room for improvement in a market flooded with sushi restaurants, including many good competitors."}
{"text":"Finally, an innovative sushi place in the downtown core! I went here on Friday at around 11:30 and got a table for four. It filled up completely almost immediately after that. My menu selections were focused on the special rolls. Unfortunately, I didn't sample any sashimi and I do find tune sashimi to offer a good benchmark of freshness.. 

That said, I had the salmon tune age roll, salmon tataki, yam roll, and the \"hell roll\". I highly recommend the hell roll for the novelty as well as ingenuity. Ichi Rock does some things differently; the tataki came on a cabbage salad with cold fried onions and dressing, the yam rolls had avocado in them and a wasabi mayo sauce, and the hell roll has fresh crab in the sauce. Very nice.

If you're working in the core and need sushi for lunch, this is the place."}
{"text":"One of the best ramens I've consumed. My friends took me here, as she's eaten at probably every ramen place in Calgary. I have to say that I'm very impressed with the ramen. I ordered the Jiro Spicy and it was way better than the ramen I had at Jinya. The broth was delicious and served piping hot. There were a ton of seared pork belly pieces that melted in my mouth. I enjoyed the crunchy tempura onion and carrot garnish. We all drank the broth, which I'm sure is pretty unhealthy to do... The regular size left me full for hours. However, my egg was overcooked and the yolk lacked that rich flavour you get from farm fresh eggs. Otherwise, it's stellar. My new favourite place for kick ass ramen."}
{"text":"Close to Office. Suggested from a bartender. 
The place is nothing exciting until you get your Ramen! Amazing presentation and flavors. Good variety or Ramen options on menu too. The broth has a little more garlic than other broths I had before, but I liked it. Pork is great and egg are good too. I did non have fish cake in mine.. which seemed  unusual for a Tonkotsu. 
Price is reasonable considering the quality. Background music is a little nauseating after a bit, but keep your focus on the Ramen! They have Sapporo on tap."}
{"text":"The worst plate of Shanghi noodles and chicken covered in grease!!!  No flavor at all except for grease!  Over priced and horrible!  I am shocked as I always see this place busy and that is why I tried it.  Never again."}
{"text":"A quick bite after a long day. I had 2 rolls, the Hell and Rocky Mountain, and both were phenomenal! The Hell was particularly awesome with crab in a creamy sauce covering a mountain of roll!
Didn't realize they had specials till I finished but I reckon the Little Piggy would have been good too.
Good friendly service in a casual cafe-style atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a small place along an odd strip on 6th Ave. It's clean and the service is great, but it doesn't look like much from the outside. 

Their specialty seems to be Ramen and they offer several versions.  I had the recommended Jiro Ramen which was excellent.  Soft egg, pan fried pork belly and a really nice broth.

Prices are high but the quality is excellent and the servings are a good size. I had the regular and there are two sizes larger so even big appetites, or small families, won't go hungry.

Overall, I'd say the broth isn't quite up to Sale Bar Hagi in New York (see my review) which I know consider the gold standard in Ramen.  But excellent just the same."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing really! 

It's a nice little romantic place but that's the only good thing I can say about it. Average quality sushi (maybe above average for Calgary) and terrible service summarizes the whole experience. We had 7 orders and it took them 35 minutes between bringing the first and the last! How can you enjoy your meal when someone has to wait an additional 35 minutes for their plate?"}
{"text":"Was in again the other day and noticed a big TV on the wall. Was that always there? Ruins the ambiance In my opinion. 

New handwritten menu in addition to the old one and they are also plugging new social media specials where you like this and post a check in on FB and you get $5 off. Unfortunately its for your next meal and its actually $5 off a minimum $30 purchase. Not the best way to get me to interact with you on social media.

Really liked their new dessert though, green tea ice cream with a chocolate brownie. Yum. The nigiri was amazing as always but my rolls weren't the best I've had there."}
{"text":"Step 2 of Sushi obsession: locate all places within walking distance of work and frequent often. The friendly folks at Ichirock know me now, in a \"you again!\" sort of way. I'm a big fan of the service and their lunchtime specials. But oh man, being known at restaurants cracks me up, especially when I bring a new crew around to chow down.

The interior is a stylish and modern red and black design with a bit of an east-asian twist, and I love the serving dishes. 

Their dine-in lunchtime specials are continuously expanding, which I'm glad for. I'm not a huge fan of the sushi special though, which makes me sad :( Luckily, they've recently added a customized bento-style lunch special, where you can pick from a variety of smaller dishes - ebi mayo, sushi, rolls, sashimi, yam tempura, and more! I had the ebi mayo and sushi yesterday, and with miso and rice on the side, I practically needed a nap at the end! It came out to 10.95, not too shabby.

If you're not into sushi, they have some pretty awesome donburi (rice with meat) specials. I really like the pork katsudon, which is an egg, deep fried pork cutlet and rice... for 6.95. Holy smokes, what a deal! 

My only complaint, and it is deeply personal, is the amount of onions they pile onto most of the cooked dishes. Onion lovers can rejoice! I however, will continue to forget to ask for them removed, and be slowly extracting them into my sad little onion piles."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite small. For some reason it looks bigger from the outside. Very limited seating. Not to mention its ran by real Japanese people. So I am sure its very authentic (I think - OK I have never been to Japan so I won't know). Anyways came here with my colleagues and I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen. It was really good. The portion is huge. The broth is not like super cremy cremy but just right. The meat is somewhat different from the other ramen places I have been to. Its as if the pork outer skin was smoked or something, it had a dark rich color. Not to mention the meat was very lean. Its really awesome the ramen came with one whole egg that was cut in half. Yes for $13 it came with egg. Not bad. The noodle is interesting as well its nice and thin. Very sure they made it in house. My colleagues ordered the spicy Tonkatsu ramen and the noodle looked different or maybe it was the same. 

My colleague told me that their spicy sauce was really good (order it on the side). Well I am not a spicy person and can't even tolerate pepper so I won't know how to appreciate spicy food or sauce.

Décor is nice and clean looking. We sat at one of those corner tables against the wall. I did see a hint of soup stain on the wall. Kind of disgusting to look at. Maybe they should clean it a bit. We came here at noon for lunch on a Tuesday and it not that busy. I have walked by during dinner time and they were super busy. Maybe its the location. 

But overall this place is not bad"}
{"text":"The place looks high-end and presents itself as an \"Izakaya\".
Kind of like a Japanese Tapas restaurant.

Unfortunately - MOST Canadians' impression of Japanese food is simply sushi, and I think the restaurant is currently in a state of flux, trying to change to a more sushi-based theme, as I suspect they were failing as an Izakaya. This is really too bad, because this place had a super cool theme! We were excited to go and try some of our Izakaya favorites - sadly, none of them were available despite being on the menu!
We tried ordering 8 dishes and were told each time \"sorry that isn't on the menu\" or the other one that KILLED ME - \"sorry the chef doesn't know how to make that\".

I see now they are offering Korean dishes alongside typical Canadian sushi crap. (rolls with too much sauce, and weird ingredients that have no business being together) Apparently they have expanded and are now offering Ramen as well.

The Service when we were there was SLOOOOOOW. One waitress only. Which shouldn't have been an issue since the place only seats 30 people...But we had to wait 15 minutes for a menu, then another 20 minutes to order. In all that time we weren't offered water, or any other beverages.

Our order of Edamame was still frozen when it was brought to us and was WAY over-priced. (they charged us $8 for soybeans with salt!!!!!)
The negiri we ordered was small, rice was under-seasoned the cuts of fish were too thin and cut incorrectly so that they were falling apart. 
The Chicken Karaage was bland and the coating was flat, one dimensional and not at all crispy.

We did try two rolls since they seemed to be the only thing on the menu that was reasonably priced and the chef was capable of making. They were o.k. but nothing special. Again, rice seasoning was waaaay off and there was so much sauce that I felt like I could have had the same meal just by staying at home and pouring my Japanese mayo into my mouth!
The Hell roll had a BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING presentation but due to the weird jelly cubes doused in sterno, the whole roll tasted of BBQ lighter fuel. Not a pleasant experience!

Overall - not my favorite dining experience in Calgary. If you want simple run-of-the-mill grocery store sushi but for some reason want to pay 3 or 4 times as much then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This is a small but tasty spot in the heart of downtown Calgary. It is not easily seen from the road but don't let that deter you. We had a few menu items: appetizers, a salad, and some specialty rolls. 

The highlight of the meal was the specialty rolls we had. The Hell Roll was a spicy and delicious menu item and it was topped with a nice spicy creamy crab sauce and presented with fire! The other roll was the Sakura Blossom. Presented like a flower, the sushi had fresh tasting seafood and a light sweet flavour complimented with the wasabi mayo. It was also presented with a mound of seasoned seaweed and fish roe. 

The sweet tuna salad was delicious and had a good punch of flavour. The tuna was very tender that it could melt in your mouth. However it felt like the salad needed acidity. 

The Takoyaki was delicious and had a good crisp fried shell. The BBQ squid had good flavour but the texture was a tad on the rubbery side. I would return here for another meal!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, but overall the food is unique and good. I would come back, but I am not a huge fan of the rolls. The fish itself is great and seems fresh!"}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it didn't impress or even satisfy.  i came with 3 friends, one of whom suggested we try.  he learned that ichi rock was opened by the same owner as the don day restaurant on 7th ave and 8th st.  i enjoy the pork neck potato stew from don day (their specialty) so i had hopes this new place would be as good for the food (as an izakaya).  sadly, it was not.  

the waitress that helped us was very friendly, but didn't seem very knowledgeable on izakaya food or what ichi rock's recommended dishes were.  i asked if there was any yakitori or kushiyaki, which she replied there were only teba wings... but she did recommend the flaming chicken, which she said was very good.  so we went with that (suicide hotness level), beef tataki, seafood okonomiyaki, takoyaki, bacon yakisoba, grilled mackerel as well as another tuna sashimi dish that i forgot how they described.  

the beef tataki came first and it was pretty terrible.  the pieces weren't very thinly sliced and tasted like previously frozen meat.  i realize that most beef tataki will be frozen, but never should it taste like it.  ginger was placed on top of each slice, i wondered if to help mask the freezer taste.

second up was the takoyaki, which wasn't bad - but wasn't anything special either.  not sure if they were or not, but it tasted like they were pre-packaged frozen store bought takoyaki.  not bad, but nothing special, same with the seafood okonomiyaki:  neither good nor bad.  it tasted like pre-packaged store bought okonomiyaki powder mix was used, with frozen mixed seafood added to the batter prior to cooking.  i have eaten a lot of takoyaki in tokyo and okonomiyaki in hiroshima, so perhaps this is an unfair comparison.. but i don't go out to eat food that tastes like what you can buy and make yourself at home.  

the crowning glory that resulted in the 1 star rating:  the chicken arrived.  for a dish that was 13.95 or 14.95 (can't remember which it was) - it was basically the size of a small plate.  there were small morsels of chicken served with onions and green peppers, drenched in a thick sauce.  i doubt all four of us were able to have more than a single tiny piece of chicken.  ARE YOU FOR REAL?!?  14 bucks for a tiny plate of chicken morsels doused in sauce, with more onions and green peppers than meat?  not everyone is that gullible homie.

the bacon yakisoba followed and was pretty standard fare (read - it's hard to fuck up), but rather light in terms of portion.  nothing really else to say about it.

the only dish that everyone enjoyed was the grilled mackerel, which was the simplest of all the dishes:  grilled and served with a light citrus soy.  it was because of this dish that we ended up additionally ordering the tuna dish, thinking perhaps we could find another good dish to salvage a mediocre meal. 

the tuna mystery dish (forgot the dish name) is best described as a mystery.. the combination of whatever they used to season made it seem like the chef was trying to be creative, without tasting the end result first.  the sauce tasted funky; it was sweet, it was sour and it was savory - all at the same time, but not in a good way while leaving a weird after-taste.   it way overpowered the taste of the fish and soundly ruined the dish.

we were served frozen grapes which were nice, when we asked for the check.  again to be fair, the waitress was very friendly and attentive to us whenever we needed her.  but overall, the food was really disappointing. i didn't think the quality of the dishes warranted the prices they were charging. my personal observation is that this is a corean run joint trying masquerade as a japanese izakaya, which is the latest soup du jour in calgary.  still, there are better (non japanese) izakayas, which offer better value for your money."}
{"text":"Located in an unassuming spot on 6th Ave., I've probably driven past it hundreds of times not even realizing that here stands a cute little Japanese restaurant. Ordered the tajoyaki, BBQ calamari, sweet tuna salad, Sakura blossom roll and Ichi Rock's signature hell roll. Everything we ordered was really good. A good balance of flavors and textures. The only item I wouldn't rush to order again is the BBQ calamari. But other than that, I would definitely order all these items again and looking forward to trying other things on the menu in the future.  Service was also attentive and friendly. Would absolutely recommend to others. Happy eating everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here raving about how there is finally an inexpensive sushi place that rivals Kinjo.

He was super correct, Ichi Rock is a tiny little dive that looks like your typical hole in the wall downtown.   It is all of those things, but they have some amazingly innovative sushi rolls to offer.  

Creativity is what keeps customers coming back, and this place sure has some unique offerings.  My favourite was their \"Hell roll\" which came with these cool stones that were literally ON FIRE next to the sushi.   It was delicious, and I will definitely be going back to see their latest innovations."}
