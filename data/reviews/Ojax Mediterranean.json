{"text":"What a treat after a night out on the Vegas Strip! Came upon this hidden gem while searching for place to eat for lunch after an afternoon of shopping! The place is very nicely decorated and a great place to bring a date or just relax without feeling rushed to eat and leave. The chicken shawarma was perfectly seasoned, the Ojax chicken lemon soup was savory and the Mediterranean salad was fully balanced with the right amount of olives, tomatoes, chunks of feta cheese, cucumber and dressing. The staff was great and tentative. Best part of the whole meal was the affordable pricing! We thought there was a mistake when we got the check,:) This meal very easily would have been triple the price where we live in California! We'll make sure to tell all of our friends and family to stop here before heading back to California. Definitely coming back here again! Thanks again Ojax!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, and WOW. The food is amazing. I highly recommend trying the octopus. Everything is fresh. The decorations are beautiful. They had live music, and the sound was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! We drove from Henderson to go to Cleo at the SLS. However, they are closed on Wednesday's ? We yelped Greek food and came across this new spot. AMAZING!   We ordered the Mezze Platter. Everything on it was amazing. I had the Mediterranean Caesar Salad and the Ojax Signature Salad. Both were delicious with tons of flavor. Next was the Chicken Kabob with Rice Pilaf. Both had a ton of flavor and delicious. 65$ for all of this! Portions are large and worth the drive. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful. Amazing food, and friendly service. You have to try the Armenian coffee. They also have live music, and an amazing sound system. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Must come and try the delicious food..!!! Very nice and great place to spend your evening with your family and friends. Quality and fast service, pleasure to deal with. Definitely recommend !!! Great costumer service"}
{"text":"Beautiful, beautiful restaurant. The decor was stunning, very well done. The food was outstanding, got the chicken shawarma, fried octopus and hummus. I would give them 5 stars but the few things that my partner and I noticed is why I'm giving two. Our waitress expected us to order as soon as we sat down without going over the menu (telling us the specials if there were any) and didn't ask us if we wanted anything other than water to drink which she didn't refill for us but one time and that was because we flagged her to ask for water. We ordered, as stated above in addition to the fish platter and fries. About 10 mins later we got the fried octopus then shortly after the chicken shawarma. 5 mins later she comes out to tell us that they ran out of fries, which we found odd that she didn't tell us after placing our order, but we just got rice instead. About 20 mins pass and we are waiting for the fish platter and when the other waitress who wasn't ours came over to give us the rice, we asked how long till the fish platter comes out. She said she would ask for us and shortly after our waitress came and started arguing with us saying we didn't order the fish platter, which was the first thing we asked about. After that we didn't see our waitress again other than seeing her focused on servicing the owner's table. We also noticed that she was on her phone, touching her face as she was handling food and at one point was eating from the kitchen. We had to walk up to the front to pay for our food because we were never checked on during our entire dinner, she only came over because we flagged her down for water and to argue with us about what we ordered. As we were paying we were helped by the waitress that wasn't ours and our waitress didn't say bye, or acknowledged us as she was walking by us to leave. It's a shame that such a gorgeous restaurant and great food was tainted by poor service. The staff needs to learn how to service more than one table and it wasn't even busy for her to not give exceptional service (there were literally 3 tables including ours and she had only us and the owner's table) which we still left gratuity even though we believe she didn't deserve it. I most likely will not be returning and cannot say I will recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! The food here is amazing. The best octopus I ever had, it literally melts in your mouth. The Greek salad was great and steak Kebab was huge and tasty.  My favorite part was the dessert. It was some Armenian dessert that I can't get out of my head to this day. Will go back just for that. The decor was fancy and romantic, perfect for date night. I took one star away for the service.  The waitress left us hanging for long periods of time without water refills or clearing out our table. Other than that it was a great experience and I have been recommending Ojax to all my friends."}
{"text":"The best place in Vegas. Great and fast service, fresh food, affordable prices, nice and cozy atmosphere. Must try, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best Med Fusion restaurants I've been to in ages.  Food is SUPERB as is the service.  Try anything they offer and you WILL NOT be disappointed.  I highly suggest the Mixed Grill Platters- it's an awesome value and tastes great to boot.  BTW-  the bartender is a hoot and does wonders.  The live music is as good as anything in Vegas.  The environment is SUPERb-enjoy!"}
{"text":"Whoa whoa whoa finally a real and excellent Greek / Arminian in my part of town.  Just discovered it today ,service ,food , ambiance are the best of all the Mediterranean I have visited in town and I have been to many as I love this cuisine  very well priced and plenty of wonderful food on your plate going back this Saturday it is beautiful inside very elegant white table cloth Highly recommend this restaurant and wish them great success.  Went back with my wife today wonderful lunch whoa what great gourmet food , roasted chicken , beet salad ,  babaganoush , calamari ,  end the cherry ice cream are out standing . Be back soon ."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is among my top preferred cuisines, so when Ojax opened near me, I made dinner plans with a friend to check it out. We arrived to a packed house on a Friday night, with a large party taking up much of the dining room. Tables and bar space were still available for walk-in, and staff were gracious and attentive despite the event.  Menu is large, with plenty of mezze and grilled entrees. We shared the baba ghanoush ($7), grilled octopus ($20), grilled shrimp ($13), and the smoked fish platter ($20)- everything was super fresh and well-prepared. The grilled shrimp was my favorite, served sizzling in a skillet with tomato and feta, and amply portioned for the price (~10 pieces). The octopus was spectacularly prepared with a great smoky flavor, similar to other versions around town, but slightly better portioned than elsewhere. The baba ghanoush and fish platter weren't as successful- the eggplant in the dip seemed shredded instead of pureed, which lent an oddly stringy texture to it and it went unfinished. I did like the unusual addition of pomegranate seeds for color and extra flavor, though. The fish platter had great presentation, but some fish were better than others and one in particular was striated and tough and went unfinished. The owner generously treated us to a dessert plate of house-made baklava and kataifi, both of which were among the better versions I've had in town. My only suggestion would be to make the pita bread in house or at least heat it prior to serving, as it was cold and tore easily rather than being the soft, pliable pillow that really highlights a great mediterranean meal.   The space is beautifully decorated and has patio seating available, and combined with the food and service a notable improvement for this plaza. Looking forward to returning for some of their meatier dishes like the grilled kabobs and lamb chops."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mediterranean place its beautifully decorated inside, we had live music last time we ate there. The food is so good and well priced! Dont get me started on that bread bowl! Service is always friendly the outside seating is cute as well! I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor to the restaurant, but the wait staff was very very poor service. What a shame."}
{"text":"I wanted to start off by saying that I'm a vegetarian and this place really knows how to have a menu that caters to all sorts of people. Masis was our server and he really took care of us! He gave us great recommendations and made us great non alcoholic beverages. The food was by far the most amazing Mediterranean food I've ever had in vegas! I highly recommend anyone here for a great time and amazing food ask for masis"}
{"text":"I fall in love with this place.nice interior,life music. the singer sang in French.best armenian food.and after all good dance music.I'll come back again."}
{"text":"So far incredible. We had the octopus. It is to die for. The lamb & basmati equally wonderful. Baklava 2 huge pieces, yum! Service was excellent. Can't wait to come back & try something else."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the atmosphere is a bit strange.  Also we had to wait forever to get our food.  We may go back for lunch but maybe not anytime soon."}
{"text":"We just tried this place and the food is absolutely amazing.   Great option for Mediterranean cuisine"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was really good, service was great, overall atmosphere of the restaurant was excellent. Will definately go back. If you like mediterranian food, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious the service was wonderful and the place is gorgeous!! I will be coming back again and again and I recommend this to everyone !! The quality of food was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. I'm lucky to have this close by, but I would drive across town for it. The octopus was incredible. Great lunch specials as well. I especially enjoyed the bread basket since we came hungry. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is so good so fresh I love it I also love the place is beautiful and I like the hostess was really nice and friendly thank you"}
{"text":"Idk where to start, beautiful atmosphere, great service , amazing food, drinks on point. Its literrally my new favorite place for lunch and or dinner! Babaganoush is probably the most addicting thing on the menu made freshh everyday! The meat platter is awesome if you happen to come with big parties as well as the mezze platter! Quality of the food is just amazing and is probably the best mediterranean i have tried yet in vegas and LA! Hands down, if u havnt tried it yet u should asap and i hear their gana start hookah up there soon cant wait for that! In conclusion this place rocks and has past my expectations by miles , it is wat mediterranean food should taste like! Come try for yourself! 5 min away from the strip!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. Made plans and dressed nice. We get there and the place looks really nice. We walk in and there's a super obnoxious live band-a man and a keyboard. We look over the menu and things seem like they're decently priced, but the live music killed my interest. I asked the waitress if they had music every night, figuring we could come back, but she said \"every night\". So I might try to check it out at lunch, and I hope there's no live band. In my opinion, they should allow some time for family and conversations, the live music is very distracting and loud. Needless to say, we left and never ate the food"}
{"text":"New place wife and I decided to try. We were greeted and treated nicely, food was pretty good. At the end of the meal we left tip on table and paid up front. Unfortunately after the weekend the wife took notice that this place charged us 12 more dollars on top of our bill.... we didn't understand why a new establishment would want to do such a thing. We contacted them and they said they'd look into it but still haven't received out money back, idk maybe they thought we were a lost cause or something.    Pretty bad feeling that this is how they'd treat us, especially since we enjoyed their food. For this reason, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Food is good, but I'm sure you guys can find other restaurants that won't take extra money when you leave the establishment."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and music.   I came here with some of my friends and we really enjoyed ourselves.    We will definitely be back again SOON.    AMAZING"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing on many levels and on top of all that the owner Victor and General Manager Gary are extremely genuine and friendly when it comes to taking care of there customers. I love Meditteranian food and this is my go to for not only that but the atmosphere is incredible. You will be nothing short of impressed with this amazing new hot spot."}
{"text":"MUST TRY! Absolutely amazing ! The staff is great, the atmosphere is modern and welcoming, and the food is BEYOND DELICIOUS!! BEST Mediterranean food in ALL OF VEGAS!  Everything is family style so order a bunch of plates and share around the table. They have live music which is so fun! Super clean and friendly.  Incredible Alcohol selection too.  Every single item we ordered was flavorful and seasoned to PERFECTION ! Oh My God Mouthwatering!  What to order :  The Grilled Platter- all types of meat  Mezzo Platter- all the traditional dips like hummus, babagunush, yogurt dip and pickled veggies  Rice Pilaf - Amazing flavor  Hand cut fries- big , fluffy, crispy CHEESE PLATTER - omg every cheese on that platter was to die for and I don't even like cheese Bread Basket - Best Pita that I've ever had !   Perfect for a family dinner or even a date for two !  Super impressive ! My family went there for my brothers graduation and we couldn't be more pleased! THANK YOU !!!"}
{"text":"Parents And I Went to try this place out ..  We had the mixed grill platter for the table which let you pick 5 items big portions feeds 4 we had the chicken lule kabob, beef lule kabob, chicken shawarma and lamb chops and let me tell you absolutely amazing!!!!! THE HUMMUS Tzatziki and fries OMG amazing ... The Live Music was wonderful  I absolutely loved it wanted to get up and dance but I was to full  But I'm definitely going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Gosh, where do I even begin?? Walking in, we weren't sure where the entrance was but two gentlemen (might be the owners or managers) who were sitting at the patio greeted us with a \"welcome\" and pointed us to the entrance. The place is hard to find if you're not familiar with the area.  Anyway, walking in, we were warmly greeted by the bartender and told us that the hostess/waitress will be with us shortly. And sure enough, we were greeted by her and told us it was open seating. The decor is beautiful. It's like fine dining. From the walls, to the lights, to centerpieces, to the bathroom decor! It was pretty fancy!  Fast forward to the food. We ordered babaganoush-my oh my! Just the flavor that I love! I always order babaganoush when we eat Mediterranean food and this is the best yet!! Close to how I make it at home. I've had some that were bitter and garlicky but this one I have no complaints! I'd go there again for it. We also ordered chicken shawarma and steak kabob, both were soooo good the steak was seasoned nicely and the chicken was just the same! My husband loved it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of some good Mediterranean food. This place had so much on the menu, that we definitely ordered more than we could eat. My absolute favorite was, believe it or not, a salad. (Im more of a fried & fatty food type of gal, so to be impressed by a salad is quite the feat) Their \"Ojax Signature Salad 10\" was a mixture of arugula, goat cheese, beets and much more mixed in a light red wine vinaigrette. This is the type of salad that will actually make you want to eat healthy.  We also ordered some amazing home-made falafel and steak kabobs. Both garnished with extra yummy items.   And, as a forever fan of outdoor seating, the patio was comfortably tucked away from the strip-mall parking lot.   The restaurant also hosts bands at night. It seems like they have a strong family vibe, so it was absolutely charming to watch a girl of about six to get up on stage and sing a few tunes of her own."}
{"text":"My coworkers brought me to Ojax for lunch on my birthday 5/10.  It was purely delicious. Wish I could've eaten more because the menu featured a lot of my favorites. Everyone enjoyed the freshness of the food and the service was perfect. Going back with my family tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great service, bartender, food. The decor is great as well as the atmosphere.  Would highly recommend checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for business meetings and wanted to have some good Mediterranean food!   The place looks amazing!! And the food was even better I'm vegetarian/vegan and they had a ton of options for me. Everything was delicious and you can taste how delicious and fresh everything is. I would come in and try it yourself. Thank you masis for the delicious sparking water mix and the great service!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they have amazing food and delicious drinks. The quality of the food is very good. Great customer service skills, and if you want an amazing drinks you should see Masees, he is amazing. Will be back"}
{"text":"This will be the best Mediterranean option in Vegas.   They just opened and the service and food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food that's reasonably priced. Don't let the outside of the building deceive you, the restaurant look inside is modern and very welcoming. Awesome staff too."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by this place!  Amazing atmosphere, the decor is so beautiful.  Food is so good. We had the shrimp cocktail, chicken and beef kabob, all these dishes were very delicious and generously portioned with a beautiful presentation.   Staff was very very pleasant too. The hostess, the server both were on point.  I wish  this place an extreme success"}
{"text":"We were there for lunch today and the food was amazing! I tried the grilled octopus and it was TO DIE FOR! Good service, good atmosphere, and amazing food! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant yesterday evening. The food was very good. Plenty of choices as well as family style on menu. The restaurant looks like something which is very upscale. The entertainment wasn't too loud where you couldn't enjoy your meal and have a conversation. A couple of patrons even went up and sang a few tunes. The portions are enough for two people to split if desired. The only reason for not rating at five stars, was service was slow due to being short staffed. If they get this fixed, it will easily earn a five star rating. We will be back and update my review next week."}
{"text":"We received a flyer in the mail and decided to try it out on a whim. We are so glad we did! The atmosphere is modern and clean, a refreshing scene for this neighborhood. And it has a misted patio that makes even summer outside seating enjoyable. We ordered a sweet tea and grey goose mule. The sweet tea had the perfect amount of sweetness and the mule was crisp and refreshing. They have a mixologist who is open to making any type of drink you can imagine. The hummus was great! The falafel was perfectly cooked with a light minty salad and the octopus had so much flavor. Can't wait to try more of their menu in the future. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best place to eat Mediterranean food in town. The prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is great too. Definetly the place to be"}
{"text":"I went there for my girlfriends birthday and the food was fabulous. Not only was it delicious but fresh. Still not sure how they are so inexpensive!!"}
{"text":"This place is like a hidden hem- literally! They've been open for a few months now. The location is in a complex shop, where TJ max and a few other places. But once you find them the entrance can be a little tricky-  Upon entering this restaurant you would not expect the gorgeous decor. I was blown away, I loved the decor and set up. The bar had this beautiful feel to it and it lit up with beauty. I could totally see a girls or moms night out at that bar!  Now this Mediterranean place is ideal for dinner, lunch and brunch. Especially if your looking for something different than your average burger and pasta. The food is delicious and grilled, it definitely has a more healthier version compared to a lot of restaurants. Our party did end up ordering there a platter, where we could try 5 styles of meat. My favorite out of the five was the chicken Swanson and beef grilled kabob  It paired well with the pita bread and hummus we ordered. We did order a lot, but did we regret it? Nope, I did enjoy our meal immensely as look forward to bring a bigger party to partake on that awesome platter deal!  Plus who doesn't like a good Tahiti sauce, or hummus. My absolute favorite is that baba Ganoush, and there was delicious, if my tummy would permit it, I would eat it all day long lol. So next time your thinking of a place to do date night, moms night out or special occasions this is your place. Did I mention the bar has some yummy drinks and a pretty cool bartender who can make some bomb drinks and even show you some bar tricks!"}
{"text":"Great service ! Amazing food !! Can't wait to be back for more !! The kabobs are a must try !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not easy to locate being without signage and set in the back of a shopping center, but well worth the effort.  It is immense, beautiful and largely unoccupied on the Monday evening of our visit.  We were warmly greeted at the door, seated at white tablecloth table and soon served a basket containing 5 different types of bread and rolls along with olive oil and butter.    We shared an order of baba gangush that was served with pita bread plus their eponymous salad which included fresh greens, arugula, radicchio, toasted almonds, baby greens and goat cheese tossed with red wine vinaigrette.  For entrees my wife chose the chicken kabob while I went with beef lute.  The chicken was very moist, the beef lute less so, but both were well seasoned and delicious."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, the restaurant very nice, indoor outdoor seating, food really good."}
{"text":"We just had dinner there and ended very disappointed. I will start with the good things: food was good-both appetizers and entrees. Typical Mediterranean cuisine. Decoration is exceptional-very high end, whoever did it is a professional. Owner/manager was very nice, but needs to be stricter with his staff. We were there for half an hour until we called so we can order. Food started coming before the drinks! It took 30 min for our drinks to come, and still some of them were missing, so we had to \"remind\" the waiters. I cannot even imagine what would happen if they had more tables (there were only 3). All the food came before I got my cocktail. Very disorganized waiters and the lady that was in the reception was giving us mean faces all night because we had kids with us. Very rude! If you have kids don't go there for dinner or lunch because you will end up with a bad experience. And you have to call them to take plates of your table otherwise nobody cares. Hopefully they will change/teach the waiters and hostess to do their job, because it will be a waste for a restaurant with such amazing decoration and good cuisine to close. At this point they are loosing clients instead of gaining."}
{"text":"Super friendly owners greeted me right when I walked in. I got to go order and the owner was very helpful about doing gluten-free options. The prices are great, the place has great atmosphere with live bands on the weekends and would highly recommend the food. I love the chicken shawarma!"}
{"text":"I had the greatest time! the food was exceptional and the service was amazing. the hostess who sat my husband and i down was kind and very well attentive. she made sure we were okay and gave us the run down on the restaurant! i'll be coming back just for maria!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food and great service,  also great prices. I had the steak kabob and it was amazing, I like the fact that the rice is separate and when you order it, it's plenty, overall the place looks really nice and the food is great."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent! The food portions are good and the food is fresh and amazing! Would highly recommend the chicken and shrimp kabobs and the rice."}
{"text":"Nice Mediterranean restaurant on the SW side of town.  It's almost too nice for the strip mall it's in.  Service was good.  The steak kabob I had was excellent.  Hummus was OK, but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Amazing food and quality. Guaranty . The real middle easter food The place look amazing very chic."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I eat my leftover steak kebab for dinner at work and I can't think of ONE bad comment for this restaurant.   The dining room is beautiful. The decor was high-end, the Greek music playing was an awesome touch and the service put a cherry on top of everything!   We came here as a party of three earlier today for lunch. Started off with the Baba Ganush appetizer which was fantastic. They brought out a whole basket full with different variations of bread (wheat, laffa, pita, and white breads). I ordered the Steak Kebab and I was really upset when they brought it out because it didn't come with a steak knife?? I figured I'd try it before I complain and guess what....YOU DONT NEED ONE! The steak was so soft and buttery that a regular butter knife was sufficient enough.   My cousin ordered the Chicken Shawarma and it was huge! The flavor was great, I loved that it wasn't too oily and the chicken was soft as well. My best friend had ordered the Calamari and that had the perfect crunch on the outside and softness on the inside.   Overall, we will totally be back. Hopefully in the evenings because every Friday evening they have live Greek music and who doesn't love that?!?!"}
{"text":"My husband and stopped a second time since our first visit was so good. We chose it over a place we normally go after our regular weekly outing. This time we ate inside. The decor is stunning- modern, elegant, tasteful, well done and what one expects from our high end, hospitality oriented town. It's hands down the loveliest place I've eaten outside of a strip casino. The food didn't disappoint. I tried the lemon chicken soup. It was beautifully seasoned- bright, fresh lemony with subtle spices that didn't overwhelm it. My husband and I shared the chicken shawarma. We love it, and my son snapped up the left overs again. The service was again excellent. The value is also very good. This restaurant has become our top of the list Las Vegas near off Strip go-to."}
{"text":"First, this place is kind of fancy. It's the kind of place you take your date to. They had live music and a large patio with misters. The decor is lovely. The food was delicious. My favorite was the baba ganoush. The shawarma was worth ordering again, but I still have a favorite place to go for shawarma. The portions are larger than the server led me to believe. We ended up with left overs, but no complaints about eating their food more than once. I would return, but it's in such an odd location. I guess it will be an option if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Well, it was my first time at this place. This place was recommended by friends of mine. The food was good, but the server we had was not good at all. She was not polite and whatever we needed she was either too late or never brought it to us. They had live music which is cool but tooooo loud that we all got headache! Anyways I don't like to come back to this place"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a big group, while visiting from Los Angeles. I loved the decor and ambiance, they had both outdoor and indoor seating, food was delicious and nicely presented, and service was good.   Felt like a warm welcoming home to go with your family or friends.   I will be back during my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful restaurant.  Server was really nice.  First time here and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"If your are hungry and want quality Mediterranean food, this is the place.  A very nice setting with outstanding customer service, (Jesus) was amazing! The restaurant is very clean and the hummus is delicious.  They serve very large portions, family style and affordable.  A great place wether you're on a date night or with family! I will definitely recommend this place to friends.  Til next Ojax...."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem..  Found this place on yelp of course and after seeing some pictures and their menu... i just had to try it!  Walking up to the restaurant it gets a little confusing on where to enter this place.. there were a few gentlemen sitting at the outside patio area smoking and eating (either the manager or owner) and instructed us to walk towards that door..  ( i really dont know if that place is a designated smoking area.. thats why i guessed it was either a manager or the owner)..  walking in.. WOW.. this place truly looks and feels like a fine dining restaurant.. to the right there is a mini bar area where people can drink and hangout and could possibly wait for a table.. with a few tables where people can also eat.. theres a host table as you walk in.. and behind that there is a wall of jarred olives.. interesting!  to the left there are plenty of seats and tables that's prepped with plates and glass and utensils ready for people to sit and a long bench style seating towards the wall..   the lighting was just awesome !! great for those selfies of yourself or pictures of the food.. intricate designs with different color patterns on the lights..   there was also a spot where i can guess where live entertainment (a stage) is set to play.. since we came in during lunch there was no one there playing.. shucks..   ordered the chicken shwarma and my wife got a steak kabob.. and both were ridiculously amazing. the food quality was really good.. also ordered the babaganoush.. and that itself was great.. just give me more of their bread (which was also awesome) and that's it and ill be good !  staff was nice and friendly.. although i had to call for them every time i needed something because they were either cleaning something or talking to the chefs in the back..   all in all. this place was really great and i recommend those who love Mediterranean food to give this place a try.. not packed at all when we went during lunch so i cant speak about dinner times..  well be back for sure!!  enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten  greek  food in many different cities over my life. This is  one of the best. great food, great service, great drinks. will be returning soon.I would describe what we ate but, I saw so many items on the menu that you usually don't see in one place  Everything we ate  was great!"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for healthy and clean  restaurants with a good ambience  very difficult to find  this combination and and this location has been vacant for so long I did not pay any attention to it and the heck just happened to see the  sign  and what a surprise ! I have stopped frequenting the restaurants on the Strip since they came up with that parking fee.   The location is one of the busiest corners in Las Vegas, namely Sahara and Decatur. It's kind of hidden away in the complex  and it's not visible from neither Decatur or Sahara, but this is quite gem of a place and the owners seems to have spent incredible amount of money and effort in turning this place into a classy restaurant and in the style of Cafe Nicole West, that used to be here long time ago, before the recession, which took  the shine away from this strip mall.  This is one of the few restaurants which has a patio dining, which is not just few chairs but it seats close to hundred people in the patio alone inside it's well lit Greek and Mediterranean ambience. There is overhead music which seems to be a Greek music. I can't make out any the lyrics but it seems to be an affection directed towards the opposite sex.  The location has changed few hands and the new owners looks like are here to stay for good.  The food is Mediterranean, which is becoming a vogue and trend for health-conscious millennials and also baby boomers. My favorite here is chicken kabob, hummus and tabbouleh with a glass of red wine.   The menu is the mainstay in any Mediterranean cuisine. The wine list is adequate and reasonably priced, service is good. I think I have found a place where I can feel happy about spending my money since I know I'm getting healthy food at decent prices and the parking is a breeze not to mention there is no fee to park !!"}
