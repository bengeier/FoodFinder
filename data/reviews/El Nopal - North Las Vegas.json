{"text":"The food is Fantastic and full of flavor! I ordered the Enchiladas and Sopes and was very pleased with the size of the meals. This place has just became my new fave spot"}
{"text":"I love eating here once a week. The food is inexpensive and fresh. I order their caldo either menudo or caldo de res for 7.99. Huge bowl serving that you will not able to finish. While you are waiting for your food,  chips and fresh salsa, green and red, and sopa de fideo are provided. During happy hour, I  order a $3 michelada. I received this huge sized glass mug with cucumber douced with tajin and valentina sauce as garnishment. Talking about it makes me want to go right now. This place is better than Robertos."}
{"text":"First time here the service was great and the food was delicious.We ordered the camarones al mojo de ajo , shrimp cocktail, tostada de ceviche de pescado and micheladas. The micheladas were 2 for 1 so that was a plus! Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"food is great, service on this day is slow could be the \"PROJECT TACO\" going on across the street. few people but only one server and one cook."}
{"text":"This place is exellent!!! The food is very very good and the costumer is outstanding. .. My recommendations to everyone who are in the mood for some real authentic food Mexican meal..."}
{"text":"First time here and will never do it again! Poor service, inability to understand the English language. Fajitas were over-cooked and dried out. Tortillas were forgotten while server attended another party and I had to flag her down for it. Wife specifically asked for non spicy enchiladas and the opposite happened. Rice and beans were watered down. When server asked if everything was okay, we told her no and the problem with all. She went in the back and a man looked out and then we didn't see anyone for 5 min and had to go in the back to get someone to give us our bill. No manager came out to speak to us nor comp the meal as we did not eat it and never received our dessert that was due us. Working in the food industry for years, I am amazed how places like this are even in business. It definitely won't last that's for sure! I will say that the atmosphere and decor is great and authentic, unfortunately, not the reason I stopped in."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed this new place the   Food was delicious our server Maria was awesome the place was nice and clean . My daughter tried the mole my husband got the Chile rellenos, I got the trio we are definitely  coming back for more to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We've  dined in and ordered delivery on grubhub. We've only tried two items from the menu so far, which are the enchilada style burritos and shrimp ceviche tostada.   We always get stuffed and are very satisfied with the flavor and amount of food for the price. I definitely would recommend this place for Mexican food. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Good food amazing service will return!   Amazing dinner special 2 fountain sodas 2 entrees and a desert for 20$"}
{"text":"From the moment we walk in to the moment we leave, EVERYTIME is a GREAT EXPERIENCE! The food is tasty and delicious, the customer service is outstanding, and it isn't too expensive. I have been here 4 times since finding out about this place and definitely will be going back. The only thing I'd say to improve is for the dollar tacos, maybe offer some sides (for additional price of course) and toppings. However, they are just a dollar! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Service: Excellent  Portions:  Generous   Prices: Affordable  Flavor: Very authentic Mexican flavor. Our group ordered menudo, machaca (loaded with meat and veggies), carnitas huarrache, and El Nopal breakfast. We were all satisfied with our choices.  I would have liked the complementary salsa to be thicker and spicier. It was watery and diluted.  Over all, thumps up! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazzzzzing food! El Caldo de 7 Mares está súper delicioso! No hay dos come este Restaurante! Y el servicio súper bien! No se cómo se llamaba la señora que nos sirvió pero se merecío un típ grande!"}
{"text":"El Nopal is a cute little restaurant with plenty of delightful dishes to chose from, today being Sunday I went with the traditional Siete Mares or seven seas sea food stew. It was very tasty and fresh. The limes were a bit hard so I chucked them in for flavoring.   They have daily lunch specials up until 3 pm.   The service was warm and attentive."}
{"text":"Nuestra comida fria pedi los camarones ala diabla NO SON AUTENTICOS la salsa es horrible y sin sabor tanbien mi horchata estaba HORRIBLE parecia agua de la llave cuando le dige ala mesera que me la canbiara por otra cosa medigo que No podia canbiarmelo tenia que cobrarme por que ya le avia tomado obiamente que tenia que tomarle pero es una porqueria de bebida muy decepcionado con este lugar mi  esposa pidio el alambre a ella le gusto aun que su comida tanbien estaba fria fue la primera vez en este lugar y sera la ultima"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. The food and service were excellent! Our server (Cynthia) was extremely courteous and made the experience a very pleasant one. We will definitely be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here by mistake. Thought it was a place a little down the way that my sister in law and i were going to have some mexican corn and ice cream. But , we decided to stay here and try just a sope each (had to keep room for the other goodies) so glad we stayed.... The service was very nice and the place is very clean and cozy. Started  with the typical chips and salsa at the table  while we wait. They give you green and red.  Im not a green salsa fan but i must say i did like this one. So,they both were good.  We ordered a pork carnita sope. It was so flavorful.  We will definitely be bringing our husbands back to enjoy a Saturday night dinner with a michelada :=)"}
{"text":"This place took over for the Red Tortilla restaurant that closed after five short months. The place has a nice vibe to it. The Manager Maria was very nice and personable and did a good job explaining the menu and their specials. They also have a15% military discount on regular priced items. The food was pretty tasty for a casual place. Hopefully they will last longer than the last place. It is a little warm in here even though there are a lot of celing fans on."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed Great service but the food is Not good at all!!! I order the mole plate the chicken tasted old the mole was deluded the the only flavor I tasted was ANISE. .Not good at all  Even my Orchata did have flavor  Sorry to say that this place was a disappointment! !!"}
{"text":"Really authentic and affordable, neighborhood Mexican food. Doesn't disappoint . All of their plates are under $10."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Not just the good, but the people. I felt like I was talking to a family member. We very much felt at home and I got that vibe from placing an order to go! The coctel de camaron was delicious, but the caldo de pollo... that was A1! Absolutely delicious! It reminded me of my childhood.  I am so happy I stopped by this little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious. My husband liked the Chile Colorado and I ordered the Biria. We enjoyed our food and they serve really generous. The flan is so delicious as well and the horchata is so awesome. The ambiance of the restaurant is so authentic and the good thing is they don't play the music really loud. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This the second time we go to El Nopal, it was 8:00 pm and it was almost time to close, and Lupita the server serve us with a great smile and attitude, when you go to other restaurants and is almost time to close, they look at you funny and with a face saying don't came in , but Lupita was the opposite she was so pleasant and nice, and her service was above and beyond, and the food was great, keep up the good work, thank you."}
{"text":"Very good food, I'd say it is very authentic Mexican food. Something my mom would make at home. I've had the tacos, fajitas, and even the shrimp was super good. The happy hour is amazing here. 2$ beer and 3$ micheladas ice cold. Yummy !!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress's are wonderful and food, the environment was great. The employees are humble and nice. Drinks and music was great :)"}
{"text":"Food is great  people are nice and alert ! Place is super clean as well !! I will definitely be coming back to try the chilaquiles"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place.. by accident last fall. We live pretty far away but it's near another business we visit. Our first trip was great but I didn't do a review. We have always loved authentic Mexican food and are always on the run so being able to sit down and enjoy the flavors and service, once again did not disappoint. Attentive service, great food. I am a creature of habit and actually went beyond my comfort zone and ordered Chile Colorado from the 2 for 20 (not a fan of pork but I love red sauce). The flavor was exactly what I'd expect. Perfect and seasoned. Finally something new, authentic. Consistent. Priced right. Plenty of options on the menu as well. One more note, I actually like that the kids' meals don't come with a drink. It encourages me to order water for my kids because I refuse to pay adult prices for children's drinks. We are a soda free household anyway (I only let them have soda outside of the house as a treat) and I haven't had it myself for nearly 5 years so good for you El Nopal... kids don't need that extra sugar! Good luck in the new year!"}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious food! Came here after a horrible experience at Las Pupusas (same shopping center), Zusanna from El Nopal made sure we had excellent service she was upbeat, courteous and very attentive! We got tostadas de camaron and fish, kids got breakfast burritos and carne asada fries everything was really delicious and tasty thank you El Nopal for turning a bad experience that you didn't own into your hands to ensure we had a pleasant family brunch. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Burrito was decent. The carne asada was good. The tacos were small and tasty like i like them. Only down was there wasn't a self serve salsa bar."}
{"text":"Unfortunately bad enough where I feel compelled to leave a review. I think this is more of a 'get what you pay for' kinda thing.   My $2 taco from here was tasty, but the chicken enchilada dish I got as my entree was bad enough that I didn't even finish it, despite how hungry I've been today. Bland, overcooked, and stale food that pretty much only left disappointment in my mouth ;-;  Like if you want something super cheap, normally I'd say this is still okay, but there are so many delicious mexican places in and around Vegas and literally the only reason I tried this over tried and true options is because they delivered on grubhub.   Unfortunately can't recommend that people eat here based on this quality of food."}
{"text":"Although the restaurant was very clean the food was not too good. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food was tasteless, old, and stale. The music was unnecessarily loud. The portions were paltry and not commensurate with the prices being charged.  Who charges for chips and salsa when you have guests ordering meals.  This was our first time there... and it will certainly be our last.  It's a shame, the waitress, although poorly trained, was very nice and trying very hard."}
{"text":"El Nopal (Quick Review)  El Nopal is just okay.  Their menu is kept basic with a few combos, tacos, burritos, and entrees.  I didn't find anything special about their Mexican food. However, I did enjoy the 3 Item Omelet. Service was pretty good when we were the only guests.  Overall, the food was just okay."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, I ordered beef shredded Enchiladas with salsa verde, really good food"}
{"text":"Went to eat here with my family because of the huge sign outside of the building that says \"lunch special everyday\". When I asked what the lunch special is they told me that the lunch special is only Monday through Friday not everyday as advertised.. every time I asked my waitress about whether they had something she had to go ask. She didn't even know what all their drink choices were, when I asked she had to go look. They are one of the only \"Mexican restaurants\" I've ever been in that didn't even have queso on the menu... the food was sub par to say the best, my kids wouldn't even eat the quesadilla. I will not return and would not recommend this place to anyone, we make better Mexican food at home and we aren't even Hispanic."}
{"text":"I'm not happy at all with this restaurant, actually I did not try the food yet because I couldn't wait for it, I went inside with my family and we wait like 5 minutes to been sitting, after some customer left a table we decided to take that table, there were working two ladies in my opinion I think they need more help because it was too much work for them, we wait 'till one of them went to clean the table like 5 more minutes so finally she took the order, my husband order a michelada beer but for some reason when she brought the drinks the michelada was on another table with other customers so she took it from them and give it to my husband, the michelada looks like somebody drink a little bit already (of course he does not gonna drink it) we left the place, I don't feel happy and I don't think its good customer service there..."}
{"text":"Nope! Tried this place twice since it's located really close to my house and was disappointed both times. The first time was because I got a carnitas burrito that was so greasy it made me sick... yeah I get that it's pork and can be greasy but this was literally dripping oil.. gross. The second time we went for some basic street tacos and while the food was fine the service was terrible with the kids working the register/ taking orders and in the kitchen.. they were obviously very concerned with closing at exactly 8:30 so they could go hang out with their friends that were parked literally right outside the front door waiting for them. They were outside talking to these people more than they were in the restaurant! It was awkward and uncomfortable. Will not be coming here ever again. Nothing like the one on Russel that one is so much better!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! My hubby got the \"alambre plate\" & I got the enchilada style burrito. Their freshly made habanero salsa is the BEST! This mexican grill is definitely our new to go to spot and the prices are incredible."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving authentic Mexican food and wanted to try a new place and thanks to Yelp we found this place. Based on their reviews and being close to home we decided to give it a try. When we went in la guerita told us to have a seat where we would like. The setting was perfect, clearly reminding me of my beautiful Mexico. They brought us chips and salsa first, then sopa de fideo and finally our food. Let me tell you, everything was awesome. My husband is super picky when it comes to any type of food, so for him to like the salsas and the sopa de fideo, it's a good sign. Finally they brought us our order, he order a shrimp cocktail and a fish ceviche tostada. Last minute we decided to order a preparada, and it was pretty good, loved the chamoy and tajin rim. He really enjoyed his food, no complaints. In regards to me, I ordered the asada huarache, and it was super delicious! I rarely like beans at food places, but the beans that were on the huarache were the best I've had, not sure if they fried them in manteca (pork lard) but they had that similar flavor, they were soooo good topped with shredded lettuce, tomato and cheese. We never order dessert when we go out, but today we decided to order the churros. They were the perfect way to finish our visit at The Nopal. If you are looking for a great place with authentic Mexican food and awesome customer service definitely give them a try, you will not regret it. Definitely found our go to place!"}
{"text":"I am so sad to write this update! We went back to dine in again and had the same waitress. She is very nice and always has refills.  She remembered us, which makes this update so much harder to write.    We ordered the 2 for 20 dinner specials!  The soup again was good, the burrito was good and the churros were bomb again.    The downside :(  The buffalo hot wings we had loved last time, were so hot this time, we could barely eat them.  Mind you we love hot wings, but this was chaos.  The mole plate I ordered on the 2 for 20 was also so hot I could barely eat it. Even mixing it with the rice and beans it was still way to hot.  I brought home the majority of the wings and mole and they were thrown in the trash.    I was told there are different cooks at different times.  This time, we saw in the back it was a woman.  There is a difference between hot and HOT...  Sad to say, I won't go back.  I loved it so much the first time, but I am not willing to take the chance to throw food in the trash.  #sigh"}
{"text":"My wife took me here for fathers day worst service I have ever recieved. The place only had one server . The food took about 40 minutes when she brought my food she did'nt bring my tortillas with my food 20 minutes later I asked for my tortillas and the server gave me a angry look like it was my fault that she did'nt bring them food was not that great worst fathers day dinner ever. Go to bonito michoacan. Great service Great food f this place"}
{"text":"First time here at El Nopal and my impression of the actual place and what it looks like it was pretty good.  I like the Mexican theme they have there it's    100%  authentic from the decor on the walls to the chairs.   The place was very clean, and had a comfortable, and friendly feel.  They have quit a few selections on the menu, but I decided to go first with the chicken enchiladas with green sauce ($7.99). I was very surprised to see the big plate that was brought to my table with the enchiladas a side of refried beans and a side of rice. The enchiladas were so fresh and tasted very delicious the rice was cooked perfectly and the beans had a very good taste to them.  After I finished that plate of enchiladas I decided to order the shrimp cocktail as well.  The shrimp cocktail ($12.99) came with a good amount of shrimp and all the fixings, like tomato, cucumber, avocado, there was a big slice of orange and some lime that came with it. You also get some crackers to accompany the cocktail. The cocktail itself was very delicious the cocktail juice had a good taste to it, and there was a reasonable amount of shrimp in the cocktail as well.  Overall just a very good experience the food was delicious the place was nice and clean and The prices were reasonable. I would definitely be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"We came in for a little snack and to celebrate Taco Tuesday, one of our favorite days of the week. I think this place is fairly new.. Maybe not. It's hidden in the back left corner space of a plaza across from Craig-Ranch park.   There was only one gal working the front and she was super nice. There were more dirty tables than clean and only 2 tables with guests. She gave us the regular and lunch special menu, but with no mention of a Taco Tuesday special that my husband had read about, so we weren't sure in that department. Oh well. After making up our minds rather quickly, we waited for about 10 minutes for her to come back around to take our order, or at least a drink order. 2 pastor tacos and a pastor and asada taco for him.  We waited another 10 minutes for our tacos in the now almost empty restaurant. And the waitress was nice enough to bring us out complimentary chips and salsa, which were good. I like when the chips are warm and fresh. My tacos looked so sad. They barely had any pastor on them. But on the other hand, my husband's looked so much better than mine. Even the meat looked better.. Which was kind of weird because we ordered together.   The only upside is that they ARE in fact $1 on Tuesdays, so I didn't feel robbed. Another plus was that my husband was so unsatisfied, he made me go back to thatChicago Taco Shop down the street (which I didn't really care for my first go round) and they completely made up for the El Nopal taco fail."}
{"text":"I was immediately put off by the INCREDIBLY rude cashier and did not even bother trying the food. There are literally thousands of other restaurants in this city that at least pretend to be nice to a potential customer."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner last night, and my entire household has been up all night with stomach pains and diarrhea. Super disappointed. I was hoping to have found a go to Mexican restaurant. Hoping this was just a fluke incident and that it normally doesn't happen."}
{"text":"I have eaten there a couple of times and It is very good place to eat mexican food. Good service, clean and spacious place and delicious food."}
{"text":"Good food and really good service. If your looking for a place to chill out and eat good mexican food this is a ok spot. They also serve beer here...."}
