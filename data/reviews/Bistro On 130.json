{"text":"Brand new sit down Italian restaurant, me and the hubby decided to try it out for a date night dinner. I was basically blown away with the food and service. It took me back to my 20's when I used to eat at fancy restaurants all the time. Love that this is right here in town and no valet necessary. 
To start, we ordered the calamari appetizer. It's served in a spicy arrabbiata sauce. This is when I realized this place is special and we were in for a real treat. Then the French onion soup, a meal in a bowl. The broth was bursting with flavor and was a perfect combination of cheese and bread. The best French Onion soup on the planet, hands down. We ordered a pizza to try; better then my local wood-fired pizza place (that used to be my favorite local Italian) up until yesterday. Nailed it! For entrees he chose the veal parmesan and I had the chicken piccata. All the dishes are served with homemade pasta, only place on this side of town who does so. We couldn't even eat half our entrees because we were so stuffed but they were perfectly executed. First Italian restaurant I have had in years who serves better food than my Italian kitchen. Mangia!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside....what's inside is what counts.  The food has been very good over our three visits.  Soup or salad come with your meals (doesn't happen much anymore) and the nice selection of entrees is sure to please most diners.  The chicken piccata is outstanding- I have a hard time ordering something else - but the salmon and good old spaghetti and meatballs don't disappoint.  Even the pizza got a big thumbs up from my picky husband.  We've brought friends here twice and and are headed back tonight with another set.  Support the non-chain little guys!  Glad to have this place in our town!"}
{"text":"I may have given this place 4 stars but our waitress wasn't nice to our granddaughter so the stars went down 

The fried mozzarella was good

I got eggplant parm. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was good. It was layered, like a lasagna, and not crispy - which is how I like it. It came with a side of penne and had I known, I would have asked for spaghetti. The homemade ranch on the salad was good

My husband got Veal Piccata. He said it was good. He got the French Onion Soup which was good too. 

There isn't a children's menu, so our 5y old Granddaughter had to order a full size spaghetti and meatballs - which was WAY too much food and $15!

The prices are high - it was $69 for three of us and we didn't order drinks or dessert"}
{"text":"We weren't to sure what to expect here.  We went based on the reviews on Yelp.  We arrived and this location is in a rundown sort of strip mall.  It didn't look inviting from the outside.

We went in and were very warmly greeted by the hostess.  We sat down very quickly.  The waitress came within a few minutes of being seated to take our drink orders.  She joked around with us and chatted with us occasionally throughout our experience.  

We received fresh warm bread which was super yummy.  We ordered the mozzarella which was tasty, hot and gooey.  So good.  I had the wedding soup and my wife had the French onion.  Our son had a Caesar salad.  Everything was seasoned very well.  And lived up to the 5 star reviews given here on Yelp.

I had the Braised short ribs which melted in my mouth.  My wife had the allouette chicken which she raves about.  Our son had the cheese ravioli which he devoured.

We had a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"New Restaurant! Loved it. The atmosphere was cozy and feels like an actual night out.  I've already been back 3x! I've had Calamari it was excellent the chicken piccata is the best I've ever had. We had my husbands b-day there 15 ppl, service was excellent! Everyone loved their food and the portions are huge! food is just amazing! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A perfect alternative to chain venues. Delicious , well prepared dishes (hand made pasta) served via attentive staff. Modest exterior hides an attractive interior establishment. Excellent calamari, eggplant, soup, pasta , meatball, desert. Relax and enjoy the repast. And, this won't cost you an arm and a leg. Great value."}
{"text":"Tried this fairly new place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  Really wasn't sure what to expect.  Bread was served warm, salad was good, made with spring mix and the ranch dressing was good.  My date had pizza and enjoyed it.  I had a chicken dish served with risotto and asparagus.  Love that this is not a chain restaurant.  Food was flavorful and not overly seasoned and salty, which you find a lot of places.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
