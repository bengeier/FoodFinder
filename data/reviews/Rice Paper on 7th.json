{"text":"Decided to try the new spot in the hood after a good workout. It was leg day, so naturally i was feeling like some Pho. I was sweating my crumbs off so I couldn't wait to get outta my car and into some A/C and eat some food. Turns out rice paper doesn't have A/C, i guess they can't afford it, its all good i've totes been there. However, they do offer some complimentary office fans, that they will gladly point in your direction free of charge (thankfully) to help cool you off from the heat outside. Very generous of them in my opinion, they hit that one out of the ball park. My bartender was a very stable, young man, probably in his early 30's and very confident. I first asked their permission to use the bathroom, they allowed, it was rather pleasant in there, almost a bit cooler then the dining area. I pondered for a short while if they would be upset if i asked to dine in the bathroom, seeing as the ambient temperature was a bit more tolerable than the dining area. I decided they might not want me to do that, so i never asked. The happy hour was pretty much a facade in my eyes, the big banner hung up outside is rather misleading in my opinion. The prices on everything are already so extreme, that the happy hour just appears to be normal pricing anywhere else you go. A $6 vodka soda isn't really anything a place should be bragging about for their happy hour. The food happy hour was even more insulting. Buttered noddles with a mint spring for only $9.5/7.5 on HH. Gee thanks rice paper. The pho price here is hands down, the highest I have seen in my 11 years on this earth. I asked the strapping young barman if the pho comes with a complimentary Iphone 7, he oddly enough told me, no it doesn't, it just includes the bowl of pho. I ordered the firecracker shrimp, tasted great, but it nearly cost my entire life savings. I guess I just can't afford this place as much as they can't afford an air conditioning unit. I'm hoping i win this weeks powerball, because then i certainly can say I will be back and i would love to order that pho. Thank you for the good service barman, you were a considerate man."}

{"text":"Our family loves Vietnamese food and we were excited to try Rice Paper on 7th, as it is so close to our home. The first thing we noticed was that there is VERY limited parking, If a dozen cars can fit, I would be shocked. Oh well, is what it is, we got a space and headed in. I would agree with another reviewer that while the inside is nice, the bar takes up WAY too much of the space. But, we weren't there to drink, so we pushed two tables together and started checking out the menu. To say this restaurant was \"warm\" would be an understatement..... it was REALLY warm and when it is  over 100 degrees and humid, thinking about eating a big bowl of hot soup......doesn't sound very appealing. Oddly enough, at the end of the meal one person in our party went to use the bathroom and FOUND the A/C! It is all in the bathrooms....so head there mid-meal if you need to cool off.....  Normally we frequent a Vietnamese restaurant further West, so we were used to their offerings. While we did see Pho and spring rolls on the menu, that was about all that seemed familiar. But with an open mind we chose an assortment of dishes to try. As we ordered and asked some questions, it became apparent that our server did not know very much about how the foods are prepared, but she was very willing to go ask questions.   So, let's get to the food.....because it is a very mixed bag of tricks, After several wrong food deliveries we started eating.    My daughter had ordered some crab puffs but was sadly disappointed that they seemed to be mostly just cream cheese. Her Pho with Shrimp was so underwhelming that she ate the completely flavorless shrimp and that was about it.    My husband had ordered the braised pork with quail eggs. While he said that the pork was very tender, he had to spent a good amount of time removing the giant blobs of fat from it before he could eat it. It was very unappetizing. He also said the whole dish smelled and tasted very gamey.   My daughter's boyfriend had ordered beef and rice dish and he said it was delicious, but portion size seemed rather small.   I ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and it was fantastic! The chicken was perfectly cooked and the noodles and sauce were very good! My portion size was great and since I hadn't been super hungry when  we arrived I have leftovers to enjoy today!    We have no idea if they have any desserts, as none were discussed or offered.  So, overall......our final thoughts on this restaurant weren't too positive. We would be very hesitant to try other dishes given the 50/50 experience that we had.I would probably just call in and order my chicken dish for takeout, but I am quite sure we won't be dining in at this restaurant again. And they seriously need to get their A/C fixed."}
{"text":"This is my first time reviewing on yelp since being new to phoenix. I live in the coronado district and a neighbor recommended that my partner n I grab some happy hour n some food before heading to the show in downtown. She recommend a new spot where we live close to. I looked it up on yelp and was a tad interest on the menu. I supposed this is a spring roll bar with a variety of fresh rolls to chose from and also you can modify your rolls to get gluten free. My first impression was a shocker that it was your not typical mama papa place like most Vietnamese restaurants. Awesome great 12 craft beers and a great happy hour. We shared all of our dishes. They were not kidding the spider roll was excellent, my partner ordered the gluten free rolls! The server recommended firecracker n garlic noodles. Excellent! I got the shaken beef and she ordered the braised pork entree and both were delicious. Went back on Sunday it was really good. Decor is modern and sleek and we will continue to be regulars. Thanks for coming in the neighborhood, we can ride our bikes there and have some drinks! We will continue to explore more restaurants around the area"}
{"text":"If you like to hang out, have a few drinks and chill, Rice Paper offers a nice bar in a charming converted house. If you want pho,this isn't the place. I'd suggest skip Rice Paper and try Pho Thanh or Da Vang instead. I ordered the large pho tai ($15 - dang!) and specially asked the waitress to make sure my pho was super hot as I like to drink hot soup. Well, she brought it out and it wasn't hot at all. I rarely do this but I sent it back. The second bowl she brought out wasn't much better; her response was this is the best the chef can do. I didn't want to press it much so ended up eating it. The soup flavor was ok. There was so much noodle in the soup - and worst, the noodle was mushy and over cooked. And there must've been half of a small onion in the soup too. Onion wasn't sliced thin enough and given the soup wasn't hot, it was rather overpowering. Overall an underwhelming and unsatisfactory experience."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place.. I got the rice paper roll with fillet mignon and the noodle soup.. Everything is great. The service also good. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"All 3 of our crab egg roles are completely burned. Upon calling to complain and address the situation the lady who answered the phone didn't seem to care much. I love Vietnamese food. So I decided to give this trendy place a try. Never again. I'll stick to pho Thanh. For how expensive this place is I shouldn't be getting burnt crab."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, decor, service. A really good place to have lunch or dinner. Friends and drinks. Greta bar options. But the pho was to plain. I like more strong flavor of the broth and that cinnamon kick. I will give another try, with another plate. Pork spring rolls are okay."}
{"text":"I was an avid fan of the original Rice Paper on 7th...as many sad pho-necians were upset, RP opened up downtown at the bottom level of an historic hotel....while rice paper continued to slander itself w sub par food, slanted rice in Scottsdale began delivering and conquering this highly contested battle of pho....anyway, neither here nor there....rice paper reopened on 7th!!! Hallalaujja!!! Wrong.....place has a great new buildout but now with Scottsdale prices. And they use the fat sized pho noodles, not that hard to find good stuff.....I also witness a cockroach fall from the window right next to my wives food...I immediately killed the insect and was given a free beer.....lucky I didn't call abc food investigators. And the service is beyond bad....pick up the pace, my pho-gettin-co"}
{"text":"I don't recommend Rice Paper for anyone with a limited amount of time for lunch. It took nearly 10 minutes to get even approached at our table, another 20+ minutes to get our food. By that time we just ordered it to go. Even our spring rolls took over 20 minutes to make, then came out with difference sauce than what the menu said.   Our server told us it was busy and apologized, but there were still plenty of empty tables. I understand that that's not the only indicator of a place being busy, but it still was disappointing. I'd mention the food, but I didn't even get a chance to eat it, I had to send it home with my wife for later as I was due back at work as soon as the food came."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere there. Love the \"U\" shaped bar and the televisions on both sides. Music was just right to fit the groove of this restaurant. Staff and locals were really friendly which made the experience so much more than expected.My fianc√© and I sat at the bar and had the Garlic noodles and fire cracker shrimp which was out of this world!! The couple next to us shared a shaking beef which they said was amazing! Can't wait to go back and try some of the other good looking food items on the menu. Oh and the cocktails were made with a little love which is always good. Looking forward to popping in there for happy hour-as the happy hour specials looked to be very enticing."}
{"text":"I was closed. Then came the NOW OPEN sign until you get to the door and find out it's closed yet again. Phone number \"can't take your call now.\"  Downtown location has terrible service. Clearly the problem is from the top down."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and it was an incredible experience! Zoey took care of us and she was so welcoming and pretty much the sweetest person ever. You could tell this was an awesome place just because even the staff that weren't on the clock were hanging out there. The place has an amazing vibe. On top of that, Zoey was really enthusiastic about the food, which she had every reason to be, because it was to die for. We ordered the lobster puffs, firecracker shrimp, the 3's company roll, and the surf and turf roll, which was all super yummy. The food so fresh, and not to mention, very aesthetically pleasing to the eye! My friend and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very nice great food....good service...love the menu extensive choices...nice atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Listen,  I am a lover of all things Pho, and Bahn mi. I have high expectations and an endless appetite for delicious broth and crunchy sweet and sour sandwiches.   This. was. Amazing.   Maybe its because its been a while since I've had REALLY good Pho (like California good). But my wife and I were both blown away by how good everything was.   We ordered 2 drinks (Beer and a Mixed cocktail) both delicious, and our bartender/server was wonderful.  We got 1 Pho with Sliced Ribeye and one Grilled Pork Bahn Mi  Pho - more like Pho-nominal! It was so effing good. The broth on its own was a more intensifed flavor than I have had with Pho in the past, and the accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Only slight complaint we had was we wish there was more cilantro - but we're nuts about the stuff so for normal people it is probably fine.   The Bahn mi - my love, my one true passion in life...ok ok not really but seriously it is my all time favorite sandwiches, so I got high expectations. Listen up ya'll, this sandwich delivers, the pork (Pork belly btws) was grilled to perfection crispy outside, smooth fatty and delicious in the middle and just so tasty, covered in a deliciously sweet heavily spiced sauce, that to me tasted like their house made housin sauce turned up to 11. Tucked in the roll which was coated with garlic mayo, and pickled cucumber (not pickles), carrots and dikon were shoved in with some raw Jalapenos and plenty of cilantro. SO FREAKING GOOD. tiny complaint here was the pickled veg definitely could have been more pickled, but it was still so good. Who doesn't love a little extra pickle in their life though eh?   All in all, this is definitely a place we'll be visiting often, very, very good."}
{"text":"One word. Terrible. Why? Because their food sucks & their price is ridiculous. I paid $13 for bbq pork with noodles & a $16 bowl of pho. I wouldn't have minded the price if it were good but both dishes was terrible. My bbq pork was dried as can be & the fish sauce for the noodle was bland. My husband had pho and he said the only reason he finished was because he was hungry, not because it was good. That with an ice tea totaled out to be $34. Don't waste your money, go to another Vietnamese restaurant, get more authentic food for half the price. I should have known better because when we walked in there was only 2-3 other people. This was lunch hour! Also, their parking lot suck so bad. Small lot, bad location. All in all, not a good experience."}
{"text":"Visited Rice Paper for the first time this weekend. Cute, quaint place. Decently crowded on a Saturday night but no wait. Nice patio. First thing I noticed is that almost every person was eating Pho. We opted for the spring rolls- an order of grilled chicken, filet, pork and surf & turf. Overall, they were very good, felt like a healthy meal. Just don't order these expecting a lot of meat. It just isn't there. The rolls came out of the kitchen family style but our server didn't know which rolls were which. The bartender had to come over and try to decipher. Ordered water with lemon. No lemon in the restaurant and the water was very very unfiltered. :("}
{"text":"I ran into Rice Paper for a quick snack, and can't wait to go back for a full meal. I had the chicken spring rolls - delicious and fresh. There is something on the menu for everyone and is a welcome late night option that's not pizza. Can't wait for the weather to cool off so I can enjoy their massive patio."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 10 times already for the past few months and each time I leave very happy. There food is De-LOY-cious! I eat and a lot of Pho places and this is number 1!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years! Their spicy edamame is the BEST! The food is always so good and the cocktails are amazing! Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome: food, service, atmosphere! I drove past Rice Paper many times, but never took the time to drop in. I'm so glad I did, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I work at this location and it's a wonderful place to work. I've also been a customer in the past. Everything is made fresh to order. No imitation meats and the ph√≤ is to die for! The spring roll bar has new items, and of course he famous firecracker shrimp is back!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice last weekend.  The spring rolls are amazing. I had the pork. My companion had the Saigon rolls.  We both loved them so much we ordered seconds and skipped the main course. Server Ethan was great!  My companion is a very indecisive person. Ethan gave great advice and was super patient with all the questions.  Next time we had the pho, which was delicious. I get the pho with the thin sliced beef and it's always good. The small pho is still a good size.  I like the new location. Roomier and more enjoyable than the original."}
{"text":"The garlic noodles + dynamite shrimp are the perfect combo mixed. Sadly the prices here are out of control for what you get."}
{"text":"Glad to be able to go to Rice Paper again!  Great food, great atmosphere, and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"So sad this is not the same place as when they originally opened years ago. I loved their sizzling beef cubes. The last time ordered them they were very small and dry. The \"original\" used to melt in your mouth. Today I ordered Pho Thai to go and it is just alright. In my opinion this place is also a bit more expensive than other Thai places in Phoenix. Not sure what happened to this authentic place."}
{"text":"Great Pho!! Very tasty and well seasoned! The fresh Spring Rolls, hands down, the best I've ever had!  Cute little place with a nice comfy atmosphere. Great service and the bar seems to have a nice variety.  I will definitely visit again and would absolutely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! Food was amazing as well as the staff!! For my first time trying Pho ever ! I'm super happy It was here. Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Forgetful bartender. Place wasn't busy at all!!!!!  Never returning to this place. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Vietnamese and WOW! This place rocks my oral happy place!!  The interior has been entirely updated with clean, simple settings and furniture. Outdoor seating is also available, but not recommended mid-July.  First - the Vietnamese iced coffee is legit. Sweet, cold, deeply flavorful.  Not included in HH prices, but that didn't stop me from partaking.  Next, lobster puffs.  Think of an upscale crab puff from your local, cookie-cutter Chinese buffet. Except real lobster at a ratio of 4:1 cream cheese.  Paired with a fantastic sweet Asian Pesto sauce, it's the best starter!  Finally, my entree was the Pomelo Shrimp Salad.  The menu is so robust, there's no way I can't come back!!"}
{"text":"I can't use enough superlatives. This place is hip and the food kills. I was in Phoenix on business and couldn't have had a better surprise. Miss this place and you will miss out. Clearly, the people/person in charge has it figured out. Truly, an Asian oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"Pho,samples,and hot ginger tea... Yep it's a very nice place to warm you up. The Pho here was what got me turned on to pho,been awhile since we've been back,they moved up from there old spot,more outdoor seating but seams like the inside lost room."}
{"text":"Better than before  Don't miss this place  Food is amazing  Firecracker shrimp is the bomb"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food! We tried the summer rolls which were fresh and delicious! We also tried the crispy rolls which were served with mint and cilantro. They were very tasty! I ordered the tempura shrimp salad which was light and delectable. The service was great and our server was very attentive. The restaurant has a very casual ambiance and my only criticism is that they could use more seating. Great place! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It was so good got the 3's company and felt so not guilty eating it!!!! Bartender was soper hot and server was very nice!!!"}
{"text":"I was so stoked to find out Rice Paper has returned to the Coronado neighborhood. The perfect rainy weather was a sign- it was time to get some Pho!   We walked up and immediatly noticed the nice covered patio with plenty of seating. It wasn't being used during our visit (because of the rain, I'm assuming). Walking in, they kept the same general vibe from before, but updated the look a little. The exposed brick is great and I love the bar.    I had a drink with house infused lychee vodka and quail egg whites, definitely a unique combination but really tasty! They have some other interestinf craft cocktails, as well as some more classic drinks. Happy hour for drinks is 11 am- 6 pm which is awesome!   I used to frequent the old location for the pho, so I had the pho ga and my boyfriend had the mixed pho with tripas, steak, beef puff, tendons, etc. Portions are pretty large so we both had the small, but there is a large option for a couple dollars more. Everything was excellent, but the best part may have been the sweet chili oil, along with the usual hoisen sauce and sriracha. Expect a very nice side portion of cilantro, basil, jalapeno, sprouts and lime. They don't skimp on these ingredients like some places!   They are in their \"soft opening\" period so staff is still learning. Still, they were friendly and enthusiastic.   There were a few things I would change, but nothing worth taking a star away:  -I didn't see any seating for larger parties other the  the patio  -while eco friendly, the re-usable plastic chopsticks were awkwardly large and slippery to use. There were forks provided but I just prefer wooden chopsticks.   - I may just have missed it, but I don't remember seeing the spicy edamame on this menu. That was one of my favorites so I hope I'm wrong and just didn't notice it.   Overall I'm excited rice paper is back and will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"This is your modern Vietnamese restaurant. You get great ambiance and service but a higher price to go with it.  Good food but be prepared for a higher price than your typical pho place."}
{"text":"If you want delicious high end fine Vietnamese food Rice paper is your place to be! Start with the Firecracker shrimp, garlic noodles, crispy and fresh spring rolls, garlic fries with bahn mi, and their Pho is all fantastic!!! You will love this place and come back over and over like we have!"}
{"text":"Was looking for Vietnamese place and check yelp. Wow, the reviews were correct.  The food was outstanding. Their specialty is the rolls and they were great. Loved the soft shelled crab and tempura shrimp. The tofu appetizers were good too. We had excellent service. Our only issue was we enjoyed the food so much we kept ordering more food till we were stuffed."}
{"text":"Yup went here during the lunch hour and they were closed. I'm confused? Weird and Unprofessional"}
{"text":"Excellent pho restaurant with a very homey experience and great service. My only complaint would be that this is not the most authentic pho I've had, but if you go in with that understanding you will certainly enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Tuna Spring Rolls with a bowl of PHO! Love this place and happy to see it open again!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, cool and welcoming. Garlic noodles and fire cracker shrimp was very tasty. Pomelo salad light and refreshing on a hot afternoon."}
{"text":"Walked in and stood at the door for the whole 5 min before someone finally came greet us. Their pho is way overpriced!! The beef broth was warm, instead of hot. and the portion is small, but the price is expensive! We will definitely not go back again!"}
{"text":"My first and last visit to rice paper. This review is not a reflection of the staff, as they were great! It does reflect he quality of food and ambiance.   There was no air conditioning, just a fan in the corner of the room. It's 100+ degrees in Phoenix, you need to have proper air conditioning as a business. My thighs were sticking to the chair with sweat and I had a sweat mustache before my food even came. We asked our waitress about it and she just laughed it off asking if it was really that hot, while fanning herself.   The food came (I was served the incorrect dish twice before my original order came up) and it was underwhelming. The lobster puffs tasted like cream cheese and I am slightly wondering if there was even lobster in them. The ratio was off. I ordered the pho and it was flavorless. Bland enough that I took a few bites and did not finish it.   Disappointed by the experience and food, as Vietnamese is one of my favorites to enjoy."}
{"text":"I took a week vacation nearby.  The environment is dusty and noisy on a very busy street.  I don't see the good atmosphere eating outside, so moved inside seating.  The food I ordered (noodle soup) was served warm, not hot right out from stove.  They are willing to re-heat.  The bill was charged incorrectly, I think it's for the other table, so they need to correct it.  Overall, I don't recommend this restaurant at all, because the food is not authentic Thai either."}
{"text":"Walked in, there are 8 people dining with one at the bar, 2 severs. Gal server said to have a seat anywhere and helped us move a table, said she'd be back shortly. I'm not sure what happened between that and getting my friend a hot tea that took 20 minutes but she got in the weeds somehow. She swung by the table and said it would be another \"2secs\" before she could return to take our order without the tea in her hands. She had greeted the table next to us who had been sitting there for quite sometime so I already knew where this was going. I saw the other server was moving at a faster pace and touching his tables frequently so I walked up to him and asked him to take over. She then approached the table and I told her politely I'd rather him serve us. He did an amazing job and treated us well so thank you Josue (sorry if I spelled it wrong)The table next to us however was forgotten about after she took their drink order and never attempted to make the drinks. She was too busy giggling and didn't even notice they left because it was taking so long. Let me note that while she spoke with them, she said\" yeah, I'm not sure if we have that drink we've been running out of stuff all week so what's you're other option\"!? why in the hell would anyone say that the a guest? Maybe there was a hiccup with the ordering, who fucking knows but c'mon! Don't sell the business short! Throughout the night she had her hands on her face, tucking her hair behind her ears before she would grab plates off tables and while standing at the POS, where everyone can openly see her, be sucking on a pen half way in her mouth. The girl needs some coaching/training before she's left on the floor in her own section because you're losing guests. Maybe it was her first day but there were rookie mistakes that were made."}
{"text":"So happy they are back.  Quality food. Friendly staff.  The menu is deep with lots of choices.  We crave this place"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous but the wait was ridiculous.  We got here at about 1:30 and at 2:30 we were still waiting for a crispy roll.  We ordered a lobster puff for app and it was great.  I ordered a wrap and a crispy wrap.  My fiance ordered a lobster crispy roll and a salmon crispy roll.  We received the roll and the lobster roll with an extra lobster roll as they made the wrong one.  I then received my salmon roll but my fiances did not come out for a looong time.   When I finally asked what the wait was they said they indercooked the first roll.  I had to ask what was going on.  I don't have an hour and a half for lunch.  We finally left without the last roll."}
{"text":"What happened???   *First I want to start off by saying that THE STAFF IS GREAT! Every time I have visited this establishment, I've been very well taken care of, so there are absolutely no complaints there.*  Okay, last week I went in for my weekly bowl of pho and it just wasn't the same. The tofu was over cooked and super tough. I thought that maybe they were just having a bad day, so I went back and ordered the same bowl of pho, but again the tofu was extremely tough and this time tasted greasy.   Unfortunately that's not all. Since the reopen of Rice Paper, their prices have gone way up, which is fine if the food is great. For the past month I've been charged $11 (used to be $7) for my small bowl of pho. Well, they recently changed their prices (NOT mentioned on the menu btw) and now charge an EXTRA $2 for vegetarian broth...what?? You're serving me a vegetarian dish and you're charging me extra for VEGGIE BROTH?! I guarantee that it cost more to slaughter an animal and marinate its soul for 25 million hours, but I get charged EXTRA (without notice) for over salted vegetable BROTH?! Why don't you just charge me al la carte for the 2 slices of lime and basil while you're at it - ridiculous. So now the total for a SMALL vegetarian bowl of pho is...ready for this...$13!!!! No thanks, I'll get off my ass and learn how to make it at home.   Welcome back to the neighborhood and thank for you for the month of pho, but now we must part :("}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in for lunch on a weekend afternoon and very much enjoyed Rice Paper. We had our toddler and twin infants with us, and I was worried we might receive an eyeroll or look of disdain for bringing so many kids to a small, hip restaurant downtown, but that was not the case at all! The bartender doubled as our server, and he was really wonderful- kind, knowledgeable, excited about their menu, personable, etc.  We started with fresh shrimp and chicken spring rolls; they were excellent.  The dipping sauce was well-balanced and a nice kick for the delicate spring rolls.  I had the braised pork bahn mi, and it was incredible.  Juicy, messy, balanced flavors, really good bread, just delicious.  My husband loved the shrimp pho.  My only complaint is that the restaurant was hot!  They definitely need to fix the a/c issue, as it made for a sticky and uncomfortable lunch.  I feel bad for the staff having to work in that heat...  We will definitely be back, but will wait for cooler weather!"}
{"text":"The hours are until 10pm, I came in at 9:02pm and they said the kitchen was closed... crappy."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant tonight after a reservation problem at another restaurant.  This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to.  I ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and it was incredible.  The waitress was terrific and the owner even stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok.   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The pho broth is definitely top notch, this is coming from a guy who grew up in Westminster, CA and has eaten his fair share of pho. Their Vietnamese coffee is also very well done. Will be coming back here."}
{"text":"My first of many visits to Rice Paper. Tried the lobster puffs and I was so surprised at the great flavor of fresh herbs and crispy wonton. The dipping sauce was tangy and it came with creamy coleslaw. I also tried the beef in grape leaves the ground beef had a nice peppery seasoning and the side sauce was nice compliment, somewhere in there was mint, very nice. Since this is a spring roll bar that's going to be my next adventure to try. The Bruce Lee looks very interesting.  Guthrie is a great bartender and made great recommendations on his sampling of the menu items."}
{"text":"I give the place 3 stars because of their nice staffs.  Not for their food. First of all, let's start with the location and the atmosphere, parking is way in the back, very limited. Patio sitting actually has more chairs and tables then inside, although I don't know what for since it's too hot to sit outside now.  Inside, the bar took up most of the space, smack right in the middle of the restaurant, it doesn't scream Vietnamese AT ALL.  It was very very hot inside the restaurant, we sat next to a floor fan which was very dirty, dirts and such that are stuck to the outside of the fan that hasn't been cleaned in a long time, it kept blowing dirt and hair into our drinks and food.  Okay, let's start on the food. Pho's broth was blah blah blah, the biggest failure any viet restaurant can have is in \"NOT being able to deliver PHO\". which is the most common dish. It's like going to BURGER KING and not able to get the hamburger ur expecting. They should take of the \"Vietnamese restaurant\" after the \"rice paper\", it's a shame, they make Vietnamese food look really bad if this what they r serving and calling themselves \"viet\" restaurant   Shaken beef was not tender enough and too sweet.  In conclusion, I won't be coming back, it was not worth my time and money at all. If you want true viet food, please go to PHO THANH, PHO 602...... this is not the place"}
{"text":"Not my ideal place for authentic pho. It is tailored towards Americans. I ordered the pho dac biet (small $13) and my boyfriend order the pho tai (small $12). The word small is the perfect amount of food!   We also got the pork spring rolls (thit heo nuong) $4.95 . I did like the pork spring rolls, but the spring rolls were not rolled tightly. So when you eat it, it gets messy and a lot of the food falls out.   When we were seated the music was way too loud. I felt like they were trying to rush us out, but towards the way they turned it down..  Overall, the food is alright, you're paying for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off all, the service here was super amazing! The staff was very kind and the food came out quick. And when the food came out, my goodness, it was one of the best bowls of pho I've had in Arizona. The broth was incredible- I had the pho with tofu and it was delicious. The best part about the dish was the rice noodles, which were cooked to perfection. Next time I will for sure try the summer rolls."}
{"text":"Went there after their reopening. Place now has a patio out front and I think new management. Food was the same as before, which has always been great. This time the service was outstanding. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've eaten at. The atmosphere is nice- brick walls and perfect amount of seating. The caramelized salmon was on point! Perfect amount of salmon and rice.  The flavors were so good! I ordered the chicken spring rolls for apps and they were a bit over priced but the still tasted good. I like that they have the option for different types of meat. The meal was $21.00 but definitely worth it! Green tea to top off the meal.  Overall the meal was really good! I rarely give 4 stars but this place had me coming back again. The service was great and it has a good bar feel. The overall experience was great!!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town by far. The springs rolls are also an excellent choice. There hasn't been one thing on the menu that I haven't liked. I've been going here every now and then for the past 4 years or so. Delicious food."}
{"text":"RP was already a bit too expensive for what they offered before they shut down both previous restaurants, imo. Their reincarnation is even more expensive now."}
{"text":"Rice Paper on 7th is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix! I've had good pho before, but their pho  was out of this world. Went for lunch today with two friends, one vegan like me and one transitioning to vegan, and everyone was just as thrilled about the food as I was. The garlic noodles are just as amazing as everyone has raved about in previous reviews. If you're vegan, make sure you specify no Parmesan. I was able to get vegan spring rolls, vegan crispy rolls, and vegan pho soup....every plate equally delicious. Fantastic service, food, ambience, and decor. The previous reviews complaining about the heat, not sure what that's about, because I get hot very easily and I found the temperature very cool inside. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Weekday evening after the dinner rush.  The parking lot was packed and we had to get creative.  I'm not sure where all the car owners were because there were not enough customers to justify how crowded the lot was.   I was excited by the variety and flavors expressed by the menu.  I ended up ordering two appetizers and a main course.  One appetizer was Garlic Noodles.  I figured since they are two of my favorite things, I couldn't go wrong.  The other was Fire Cracker Shrimp.  Pho Tom was the main course.  Fire cracker shrimp was worth a 5-star rating.  Delicious.  As good as it was, the Garlic Noodles were a tremendous disappointment.  Top Ramen for grown ups with garlic flavor for ten bucks!  In a word, no.  The Pho Tom reminded me of posole ... very little cooked in the actual broth; what you want to add in you do on your own at the end from fresh, natural ingredients.  I particularly like the sensation that lime juice creates in this situation.  With the Pho Tom, I learned of something new that filled me with delight, which is the subtle addition of mint leaves.  In general, the only use I have for mint is in my Crest toothpaste.  But in this context, it was spectacular!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a gem... at its old location, just south of the current place. Their Pho broth was fragrant, veggies were fresh, the meat plentiful and of high quality. In fact, this was the first Pho restaurant that I frequented that used nice sized slices of eye of round and whose Banh Mi did not feature toasted wonderbread.  Not sure what happened but I noticed that the quality starting falling rapidly. Veggies were wilted, broth served lukewarm, and service was severely lacking. During a lunch visit with my children, I sent my bowl back to the kitchen to be reheated. I did not get my lunch returned until my children had finished their meal. I think our waiter forgot and simply left my bowl in the microwave.  Though the 1st location closed for repairs, I didn't fret as I frequented their 2nd location at the San Carlos Hotel. In fact I preferred this location due to the close proximity with my place of employment. Their pho was above average; the food quality impressive. After awhile, it seemed as though they could not maintain standards either. I noticed that the broth became watered down, veggies became old and wilted and the service lackluster. The gradual decline of standards at the San Carlos location seemed to seal their fate and this location shuttered shortly after. Since Rice Paper was my go to spot for Pho, I tried to give them a last shot at their new location. I visited recently with my children and was not impressed. I was hoping that the quality of food would follow the price increases. Needless to say, Rice Paper is a lost cause."}
{"text":"HOW I HAVE MISSED LON.  Sad part is that she has to start from scratch with Yelp.  Hundreds of favorable reviews to recapture but that should be easy.  Same amazing food and same ol' Lon.  I have searched high and low and have not found anything comparable.  Glad Rice Paper is back."}
{"text":"Portions are large prices are a bit higher than your usual Vietnamese restaurant but the atmosphere is very hip, mod, urban worth the extra cost for a good experience."}
{"text":"My 1st Phoenix Pho. Being from the bay area I was hesitant attempting to get pho in Phoenix, BUT this place exceeded my extremely critical pho expectations. From the fine you enter this cute cafe your warmly greeted and felt like family. The phone spring rolls are beyound authenticity and perfection. I highly recommend trying this fantastic pho place out. Bon appetite."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Nice vibe, good drinks...but the service on this trip was AWFUL.  I called in an order and the staff rushed me off the phone.  She was literally RUDE.  Yep, it's Christmas Eve and our family tradition is to do take out.  Thought we'd give a new neighborhood joint a try.    Here's the thing folks, if you don't want to work, then don't open your establishment.  Not sure if I received a 'thank you' for your business--let alone a 'happy holidays'.    Not sure I'll come back because of this.  Like I said, solid joint, but plenty others there that are willing to match quality food with quality service."}
{"text":"I've tried to go twice now during their supposedly open hours (once for happy hour, once for dinner), and both times it was closed with a tiny handwritten note on the door. Not sure I want to bother trying again. Seems like they've got issues."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.. The pho amazing, and bonus you don't leave smelling like pho. The best thing I have had are the lobster pops from the apps menu. Great local beer and amazing staff. Nice date atmosphere but also chill. Love it !"}
{"text":"This place reopened down the street from where it was and I am happy it did. I am bummed they stopped having blue moon on tap but not too bummed.   Positives: firecracker shrimp is the best  garlic wings are great when they dont over cook them which is rare  Their chicken pho is the probably the only pho I have ever tried and actually liked  happy hour prices are great  Negatives:   I feel their spring rolls could use something. They have a variety of them and the sauces they have are good but they always seem too be off a bit. Like the meat is too dry or there is too much lettuce used."}
