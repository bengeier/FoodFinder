{"text":"Pizza is not the best but the staff is.  Really nice guys, fast moving and generous.  I stop mostly for slices on the way home.  I call from my car and run in and take out for eating at home.  The slices are huge.  The sauce is tasty.  Not the best Ive eaten but a great weekday pizza place.  My only regret is that they use a pizza converyor cooker and not a pizza oven, so the crust doesnt get that crispy.  
Ill be back.  Perfect neighborhood pizza parlor."}
{"text":"Antonio's is my go-to local pizza joint. I LOVE pizza and IMO this is thee best pizza in the South Hills. A group of us had a party, where 15 different pizza shops were represented. The only one that held candle to Antonio's was the great Vincent's Ardmore location.
  Better still for me is that I can be there in 5 minutes from home. Thanks for serving up awesome pies! Keep em coming!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the customer service was terrible. I got charged twice for my order (first $37, second being $31) and they showed up at my door the next day with the same food. I don't know why my order or credit info was saved twice, but accidents happen. They took the food back but didn't take away the second charge. I called and talked to the manager and he blew me off saying he would look into it and call me back and I never heard from him again even calling back again and again. Extremely disappointing for such a good pizza place to have ripped me off like that."}
{"text":"Pizza and hoagies are ok nothing great.   The staff is friendly.  The restaurant area was clean.   nice place to eat in."}
{"text":"The bread sticks and french fries were decent, but the pizza and the chicken fingers are great.  Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Antonio's is our \"go-to\" for delivered pizza in our area. We are Dormont dwellers and although Antonio's is in Brookline, it's close enough. 

We've tried the rest, Antonio's is the one that my sweetie and I agree on. 

Tonight we ordered a large pizza and two small orders of wings. (We were not agreeing on the flavor of wings tonight.) Both of us started with our wings tonight, and both of us raved about them. They were perfect, just perfect.

Our pizza got second billing tonight, but it wasn't the pizza's fault. Actually, it was very good. The sauce has some \"tang\" to it, the toppings are fresh and there are plenty of them. (Tonight we had Pepperoni and mushrooms...)

Often we order their pasta dishes and have never been disappointed. I'm a particular fan of their baked ziti. 

I have to point out that their delivery drivers are part of the equation. Although the stand time quoted is 40 minutes, we consistently get our food (in the next neighborhood) within 25 minutes and often within 20. That is very impressive. Admittedly we tip the drivers well every time. 

So... If you live in Brookline, Dormont or Beechview and are in the mood for some takeout, ring up Antonio's!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good and the staff were nice to customers. But while there could hear the the way the, I'm assuming owner talked to the young staff,  horrible. Very demeaning would never let my kid work there."}
{"text":"Have been a loyal customer here. Good pizza but tonight order never showed up. Was supposed to be 30-45 minutes and nothing. Called and was told he should be on his way. Never saw them. It's a shame. Called and cancelled the order."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is wonderful, they really go above and beyond!! They are always extremely friendly and accommodating to our family especially our kids"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a simple order of 2 gyros and order of fries.  When the driver finally arrived he demanded I give him the money before he handed me my my food.. The food was cold and the fries were black and greasy.  I told him I did want the food and I wanted my money back...  he became rude and belligerent. I called back to talk to management and make a complaint.  They basically told me to call in the morning to talk to the owner. By the way tried to give the food tome dogs and either one would eat it either!"}
{"text":"Food here always great, don't eat pizza so can't speak for that, but their hoagies are some of the best around, stuffed with meat & on good bread. Antonio's usually my go to spot for take out hoagies in brookline"}
{"text":"This is place is just the greatest. The pizza is fantastic, one of the best I've ever had. The staff is so awesome, attentive, and personable. I've never had a an encounter less than perfect with them. Tony's garlic bread is seriously addictive."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit and we will definitely be back. The food is very good, reasonably priced and the customer service is probably the best I've had at a restaurant in years."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  First time for Antonio's. Awesome dough. When reheated my mushroom pie kinda turned to a floppy mess. But, I can't deduct a star for reheated pizza. Go for it!"}
{"text":"I have only tried the pizza but it was very good! I enjoy taking my kids for lunch...they offer huge slices for $1.99!"}
{"text":"I love Antonio's Pizzeria. The sauce isn't too sweet, which seems to be a trend among Pittsburgh pizzerias. I prefer a more acidic tasting sauce, and Antonio's has it. The prices are great too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, pizza, I really wanted to like you, but you were a complete let-down.  After my first love in pizza, Slice, decided to go downhill, I was on a quest for a new number 1 spot.  After reading some reviews, I decided to give Antonio's a try. 

We ordered a large pizza with garlic sauce, bacon and half tomato and half spinach.  I also ordered the chicken parm half hoagie.  While the toppings were more than adequate, the crust was a complete disappointment.  Yeasty, flavorless - it so brought down the excitement I had at seeing a pizza actually covered in toppings. 

The chicken parm sandwich was ok.  It was large which I appreciated and the tomato sauce was pretty tasty, but the chicken was lackluster and there was hardly any cheese atop it's crusty shell.  

We will likely not be back and the pizza exploration continues!

One major plus was that the guy that answered the phone might have been the most pleasant, competent and kindest pizza order taker I have ever in my life spoken to.  So props for training your people how to be considerate on the phone!"}
{"text":"yelp 10% discount deal was refused because only manager knows how to apply it. note to manager: please train your employees in applying discounts.

The pizza's not very good, either. Nowhere near the level of Mineo's or, of course, Fiori's."}
{"text":"Good but nothing great. We ordered Hawaiian, meat lovers, and 6 buffalo wings. Pizza was a little soggy but you got generous toppings. Sauce was ok but too much crust. Wings were large in size and the buffalo was hot. Price for the amount you get and the service was good"}
{"text":"This place was good at one time.   Tonight though pissed me off enough to write this short review.  Missing an order of fries...the 2 others were cold and 2 cold gyros with big chunks of yellow lettuce and a runny white sauce mostly sponged up by the pita, making it inedible.  Sorry, won't be calling back.  It's not easy to find a good delivery place around here, with a little effort someone could really do well, but some don't get it till it's too late."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of pizza, but I had a mean slice of pie here early last month with sausage. It surely satisfied my craving. I'm glad Vinnie's Pretzels was closed that day or else I would have never gotten to try this excellent pizza."}
{"text":"Came here as this was the last stop (side note - I originally wrote \"lost\" stop and then realized what a Freudian slip that was!!) on the Pittsburgh Food tour and frankly, I found this place to be the usual pedestrian plastic cheese pizza place with an undercooked base. 

There might be other flavors but we had the cheese pizza and it was okay - not something I would come back here again for.

Yelp Review 45/2017"}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 it wasn't super delicious but it did the job. The cheese is super silky. Slices are extra crunchy. Cheese fries are well, cheese fries. Not extremely greasy which is always a plus! Very good customer service, however. That's important."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh 5 years, and have had mediocre pizza from several places since moving here.  I even went back to just ordering from Dominoes, I was so discouraged.  So ,I  tried Antonio's delivery tonight.  Glad I did!  Their sauce is really good and the amount of cheese on the pizza was perfect!  Crust was crispy yet chewy.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their italian hoagies are very good!  I have stopped in the shop and picked up food and had food delivered and all the workers are very pleasant and polite.  Service with a smile is always a nice thing :)  I havent had their pizza yet, but definitely will in the near future.  Can't wait to try that."}
{"text":"Insanely enough, Kay had a craving for pizza after eating at Johnny's Diner and Scoops on Beverly. She at first craved a hot dog, but Hank's Too is closed on Sundays. She changed her mind, saying she wanted something...salty. Alas, Vinnie's Pretzels is closed on the Sabbath also. 

\"Pizza. I'll settle for a slice of pizza.\" 

Arbitrarily, we shuffled into Antonio's for two cuts of sausage-adorned pizza, and I was thankful for it was better than I recalled. The sauce was sweet, the cheese was lardy, and the crust cracked from the dental pressure I applied to it. 

I was also thankful that pizza-hating Kay loved it. Her urge was satisfied, and thus her dark side went into remission for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I was a little hungry while walking on Brookline Blvd and was lured in by the smell of pizza and their pizza by the slice sign outside.  I got one huge slice for $2+ tax.  The slice was great, but I regretted adding the crushed red peppers.  For some reason these were the hottest red peppers Ive ever added to a pizza.  My lips were so hot that it even hurt to lick them lol.  I almost always add the crushed pepper when available at a pizzeria, but wish I had passed this time.  I quickly dashed across the street afterwards to cool off with some ice cream from Scoops on the Blvd.  I liked the pizza and will be back for more, just gotta remember to go light on the peppers next time."}
