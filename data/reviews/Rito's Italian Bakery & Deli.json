{"text":"If you are looking for real Italian bakery this is the place.  We've been getting Rito's for years.  Best European style hard crust bread in the city, almond paste cookies, cassata cake, and cannoli.  This truly is the best family bakery in Cleveland with old world style cookies and pastries!"}
{"text":"I like going to rito's because of their fresh bread, but the women that work their are not very nice.  Every time I come in they seem to go in the back and hide. The one lady (who I think is the manager, but not quite sure) never ever smiles and is actually quite rude. I do like their lunch meat though, some of their cookies are great. Some of their desserts are not very fresh though, like their cupcakes. All in all I do go their because my family loves their Italian bread, but they need new employees."}
{"text":"The staff is very rude and act like they are annoyed by your questions especially the woman! I am italian and know what a real fresh cannoli tastes like. The cannoli I purchased here first of all the shell was super stale and the cannoli cream was pre made. Come to find out when I asked them, the woman said there pastries and goodies are not even made there. Along with another puff pastry I tried it tasted like the frozen pastry puffs you get from Wal-Mart and unthaw them..so disappointed was really hoping for a \"Real\" Italian bakery only thing fresh here is possibly the bread but haven't tried it ..I will not be going back .Shame on you for calling yourself an Italian Bakery.."}
{"text":"I have only ordered the cannolis from here but man they are good! I love cannolis, and these guy's cannolis are good enough to write a review just  about them!   I will have to order some other items to be a little more fair in my review, stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Everytime my fianc√© or I go in there all the employees are rude and it makes for a bad overall experience we live down the street and refuse to ever go back there for our bakery."}
{"text":"What a selection!  The cookies are tremendous.  Angel wings are my favorite.  Fresh bread daily.  Awesome cakes and authentic Italian everything.  The Italian ice is to die for."}
{"text":"I've been stopping by Rito's Bakery in Parma for years.  The bakery is awesome.  I love their Sicilian sheet pizza and lemon biscottis especially.  Recently, I went to Rito's to have them cater a lunch for work.  I choose the Italian deli tray with all the special Italian meats and cheeses and the American deli tray.  This has to be the most freshest meat, cheeses and breads I ever had from deli trays.  In fact, the morning I came to pick up the order, the bread & rolls were still warm.  Not only did we have plenty of fixin's to make sandwiches but the trays each included salads and their amazing Sicilian sheet pizza.   I received exceptional quality and quantity for the value.  Very affordable and uber delicious."}
{"text":"This is my second review.  After dealing with a pretty rude associate at the location on Pleasant Valley back in May, I posted a review  at that time  about my experience . I was contacted by Rito's and given an apology as well as repeating my order for another day, free of charge as a courtesy.  That was more than I expected. The fact that they took the time out to contact me and apologize was sufficient. This is the customer service that has kept them in business soo long.  Very pleased with Rito's and obviously will keep giving them my business!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian bakery, cannolis are delicious, some of the other pastries are good. Their deli sandwiches that they make fresh to order are delicious. Their Italian ice is my favorite, they have strawberry and traditional lemon. Definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"I don't recommend the cakes or cookies but I did get a paska bread there  on Easter and it was excellent!!"}
{"text":"After having a few issues, ritos was fast to resolve my problem and correct it. I am very satisfied with their customer service. They are a family run business and treat customers well. In today's corporate America, it's hard to find businesses that still actually care enough to make sure every customer is satisfied.  As far as the bakery, they have the best pizzelles on planet earth. There pastries and cookies are above average and reasonably priced.   I haven't tried the deli items yet, but will be back many times and will be sure to do so."}
{"text":"Rito's swiftly, and accurately corrected my issue regarding the large sandwhiches. I hereby present them with a 5 star, service, and quality."}
{"text":"Ritos has let me down time after time.  I have given it multiple chances and will not be returning.   I went there yesterday which was a Saturday at 5:30.  The employees were very rude, I assume because they close at 6:00.  Regardless I bought 2 pizza doughs, garlic bread and a chocolate cupcake.  At first the women said they had no pizza dough, then said she had frozen.  I asked how long it takes to thaw and she laughed as to mock my intelligence and said 30 minutes.   As I walked over to the deli to look, another woman saw me and rushed over to cover things.  She had an angry look as if to say deli is closed.  I felt I had 30 minutes left since said close time is 6:00.  At the end of the day the pizza dough was good, galic bread was dry and almost no flavor, and the cupcake dry and tasteless.   Never again Ritos, you guys stink!!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this bakery!  Stopped in for some bakery for a friend who just had a baby. The woman working there didn't acknowledge me when I walked in, even when I greeted her!  She was too busy complaining to a customer about \"all the Indians\" owning local businesses. Disgusting!  In hindsight i should've just walk out at that point. The woman finally asked \"what do you want\". I ordered a few baked goods and paid without so much as even a smile from this woman. The empty parking lot should've been a sign of what to expect. Anyway, it's sad that I won't be shopping here again because I truly want to patronize local businesses. I will spend my money at another bakery."}
