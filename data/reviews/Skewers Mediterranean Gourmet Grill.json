{"text":"Amazing food! I was shocked how great it was.  The meat is tender and taste soooo good.  I think this is one of the best places I ate at.  We also got french fries - damn...you must try it.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fresh made-to-order Middle Eastern grilled meat wraps and platters. So excited to finally have some great Arab food along Lakeshore. Owner is very hospitable, greeted us at the door and was friendly and chatted us up while we were there."}
{"text":"Great new spot near Port Credit right next to Dairy Cream. Had the Fabulous Tikka Wrap and the Tabule and my lady had the Fat Uncle Wrap. The food was great, everything was very very fresh and delicious. Place is super clean and run by friendly staff. Dine in room for about 12-14 people. Will visit again, now off next door to Dairy Cream for desert!"}
