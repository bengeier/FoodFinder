{"text":"Delivery was short 2 items...  After contacting business the food actually came from, they stated that Tempe takeout was told they did not have some of the items I ordered.  I was NOT notified and the delivery guy did not mention that my order was missing items, but gladly took all the money and quickly left.   Move on, do not use this site!!!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that Tempe Takeout has a wide range of different food choices, from Indian to your good ol' fashion hamburger.  My experience with them have been positive--hot food on delivery, great communication and of course great food.  I use them at least once a week!"}
{"text":"5 dollar delivery fee and a 12% driver gratuity required to order from here plus a 1.5 to 2.5 hour delivery time, getting the food room temperature. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I attempted to place an order, I dont think it matters which restaurant.  When I placed the order I was given a timeframe of 1 -1 hour 15 minutes.  Since it is Valentine's Day, that seemed reasonable.  I got a call from a 229 area code (Georgia???) at the time the delivery was supposed to be at my door.  They said it was going to be another hour and a half.  I cancelled my order, and I'm thinking I will probably have to file a claim to get my money back.  The person who called did not identify who he was with or his name until i asked him...and then he said his name was the same as mine.  The manager did not want to speak to me and no one seemed to know what was happening.  This was my first time trying their delivery service and it is the last.  I suppose if I waited 3 hours for a hamburger, it would be piping hot and fresh when it got here...right?  I wold give this place less than one star if possible."}
{"text":"Tempe Takeout is a nice local business that looks to provide delivery for places that don't always deliver but have takeout. While this is an awesome idea there are problems that arise. If something is missing you have to contact them to contact the restaurant and this can take over an hour.   Another major issue and one of great concern is that some places they have listed will have prices different from their own menu's by up to $1.50 which is very concerning."}
{"text":"I took them an hour and a half to get my order delivered. That alone is enough to never use the service again. They add in the \"gratuity\" which makes it a fee not a gratuity. They also add a $3+ fee for using a credit card. Never using this service again."}
{"text":"I ordered a $20.00 hamburger and fries from Boulders and I can only describe it as low grade dos food. The hamburger meat was not fresh, the pineapple was canned, tomatoes yellow and the overlooked meet was like a hockey puck. Oh and did I mention the fries were raw. The worst part is that when I called to complain, the guy on the phone who said he was the owner told me he would call me back and there was nothing after two and a half hours. When I called back the guy, who would not give me his name, refused to rectify the situation at all. I would have been happy with a five dollar coupon but instead he was condescending and self-righteous. Oh and they automatically add a 15% gratuity to every order. It is not worth the money and I predict they will be out of business in 6months."}
{"text":"Ordered food and told it would take 45 minutes from a restaurant on Mill. We are .5 miles away from Mill. The order was placed at 9:20p We received a call at 10:20 saying the restaurant was closed. After looking up the restaurant's closing time they closed at 10. We were informed that we couldn't get our order until after the restaurant closed. We asked for a supervisor. They were not able to provide any solutions. Being successful ASU graduates, after having a long day at at work, we decided to give these guys a shot and they blew it. An hour later after being on the phone with them for quite some time they were not able to confirm if/when they would be able to give us our money back. Everything seems a little sketchy with them and after receiving all of the other 1 star reviews I am certain they are not reliable with what they say they can deliver, service wise. This was our first time trying them out as opposed to delicious deliveries and moving forward we will decide to never use them and will let anyone know who considers delivery of what our experience was."}
