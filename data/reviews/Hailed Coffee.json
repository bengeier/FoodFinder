{"text":"The only thing I would complain about here is the location.  It's a little too far for me to come to with any regularity.  If I need a moment to escape the hustle and bustle of the city - to feel like I am in some small modern cafe in the Middle East or Central Asia - this is the place.   Really nice job. An asset for the community.  Look forward to seeing you expand into other areas of the city."}
{"text":"Adore this place. Everything about it tickles me silly. It's super cute yet modern, and the food was delicious! Coffees superb.   We had an almond milk cappuccino (excellent) and cortado (very good), two biscotti snacks (so delicious), and lastly the roasted pistachio croissant (O.M.G. where have you been all my life?!?).   Can't wait to go back again. *swoon*"}
{"text":"Another great addition to the boutique cafe scene in Toronto. The best choice and a new experience if you have never had Cardamom with your coffee, is the tailor made Hailed Cappuccino , infused with cardamom . This spice takes the taste of coffee and coffee culture to a whole new level. This place is probably the only place or one of the few places in town that adds spices to their espresso drinks. The selection of dates they carry is very good and one must at least indulge in a few different dates with different tastes and textures ."}
{"text":"My favorite cheese and zaatar croissant ever, latte infused with cardamom taste a little bitter than usual lattes .. but overall was a good experience"}
{"text":"Just had my first Cortado cup, espresso coffee mixed with half&half, and it was amazing! Perfect amount of coffee. Friendly place, nice vibes, and great location. I forgot to hail my cup, add their signature cardamon syrup, but definitely will next time ;)"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend. After chatting with the owner for a few minutes about the menu, we ordered the Arabic coffee at his recommendation. Not knowing much about the subject, I was a bit worried about getting an overly strong, Turkish-style coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised by how understated it was! The cardamom flavour comes across quite nicely, and the lighter consistency of the coffee made it really easy to polish off the whole pot between the two of us.   Also really liked the accompanying dates. I had no idea what to expect out of dates to be honest, but they were great. Combined with the really relaxed, clean asthetic of Hailed, I would 10/10 go again."}
{"text":"My favourite cafe in the area Great coffee (Arabic coffee and any of their Hailed drinks), great maamoul, great dates!"}
{"text":"Hailed coffee #Toronto, where proper Arabic coffee is found!! It comes in a shareable pot for 2-4 with a side of premium dates!!  They also have a hailed cap which is not to miss."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to our neighbourhood.   The coffee, the environment,  the staff are amazing.   It is a must try."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with Hailed Coffee. I am surprised at finding such a nice coffee shop in this neighborhood. This is my first time to try Turkish Coffee. It is very tasty and smooth. This is my best coffee in my life. The place is very clean and bright. They do not have many seats, but they have good size table if you want to bring your laptop to work. The service is nice and friendly. This will be my favorite place. Next time I will try Arabic coffee or drip cofee and some pastries."}
{"text":"Love the infused cardamom flavors in their drinks and snacks... hailed chocolate is amazing. Great ambience and free wifi. Lovely hang out spot!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Nice staff! A welcome addition to the 'hood! Loved the cardamom shot. Dates were delish!  Who knew?  I like the ever-evolving nature of this street. It's moving from a monoculture to something truly more polycultural."}
{"text":"Great lighting, great relaxed ambience that's not too crowded, and friendly baristas. However, I ordered the cardamom latte and didn't taste anything special about it. The latte in itself was also just average in my opinion-- and the the food and drinks are definitely overpriced. It's a good place to just get that one airy Instagram caf√© shot and for a quiet spot to catch up with a friend, but if you're just going for good coffee, I'd say you're better off choosing somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love it a Latteeeee ! What's your fav coffee to get!? Leave a comment below and let me know! .  I made it to @hailedcoffee!! Took me long enough!  Such a serene interior and lovely people serving it. Loved everything about it!!"}
{"text":"This was an impromptu visit to this area as was in the vicinity. This neighborhood's main strip seems to be on the way up as a lot of new establishments on this stretch of Gerrard.  The setup is clean with an open concept and an airy feel. Nice display area with an assortment of desserts on the offer. I tried a cortado as had my cappuccino fix earlier on. Here is verdict Espresso:Medium/light Crema': OK Milk: Done well Latte Art: OK.  Decent attempt at a cortado. Now for the bad I tried a bit of the pistachio madeline. Oh boy something was really off as the rose essence completely overwhelmed even the mighty pistachio. The filling idea is interesting but poorly executed IMO. Now for the service hmmm not sure what to say when the barista orders your around to do the chores they are paid to do! I don't think I will revisit  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Hard to find behind the scaffolding of construction, but this tiny coffee shop provides help in a void created by the 777 Bay Starbucks closing (did you know Starbuckses can close?). Nice coffee but they should fill the drip coffee up to the top of the cup, we always have to ask to fill it up more. (Except today when the lady was really good about that!)  Interesting snack choices including dates with tahini."}
{"text":"Excited with the concept, location and general offerings but I thought the mammools were overpriced and I guess I got the counter staff on an off day. I am happy to give it another shot."}
{"text":"As I was on my way to Wonder Pens, I saw Hailed Coffee and knew I had to try it seeing the space in the cafe as well as the aesthetics! So I got their regular latte which is cheaper by a couple dimes from their hailed-coffee. Because of my awkwardness, I didn't ask what the difference was but I'm assuming the specialty coffee they use is different.  For $5.25 I got a regular latte in store. The espresso wasn't too strong and the latte was very smooth. I'm not a coffee expert but it was definitely a good cup of coffee. And the cup is pretty decent size as well. However, the cost is pricier than most coffee shops I've been to.   For seating, there are two tables at the front and five in the back. Around afternoon time, there was still lots of space and I got a whole table to myself! I saw that they have wifi so be sure to ask if you need it. Barista was friendly as well!"}
{"text":"What an experience.  I had the signature cardamom cappuccino and it was the best I've ever had.  Then had an espresso tasting (from a citrus espresso to the house brand espresso). Definitely one of the best cafes in the city and a good place to visit after dinner on a date"}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than this! The hailed latte (a cardamom latte) is absolutely delicious. The desserts and coffee accompaniments are excellent with a lot of not overly sweet options (such as the pistachio cookie). The brightly lit spot is a great take out or sit down spot. My only gripe is that is isn't closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot in the neighbourhood. I love the Hailed latte. Service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a hidden gem. Go there and try their Hailed Cap which is infused with cardamom. You wont regret it.   Very friendly staff and nice atmosphere where they play oriental music and serve authentic arabic coffee and desserts.   A must try!!"}
{"text":"A turkish coffee, with a cardamon kick, a few dates and a pistachio filled cookie, a special treat. A little out of the way but well worth the trip. A special place, making special things., well done."}
{"text":"Hailed stands out from the endless plethora of same-old-same-styled boutique/indie coffee shops in Toronto simply by bringing contemporary Arabic coffee culture to the scene. That should be enough to make you come for a taste, or so I hope.  You could have a cappuccino, or you could \"make it hailed\" (basically get it cardamom-ized, yo). You can also try a handful of their handful selection of dates. Whatever you do, definitely go for their lovely-n-sweet pistachio baklava. Watch out for lifestyle blogger/Instagrammer types falling in love with the minimalist space.  But if you decide to go the extra mile for the Arabic coffee experience ($9 for a small pot suitable for 2), be forewarned. Firstly, it takes quite a while for a pot to brew. Secondly, it takes even longer for you to enjoy--next thing you know, you've been here all afternoon! It's quite a delicate tea-like aroma and experience, and maybe it's a good thing they open late on Fridays and Sats. Maybe it's a good thing they're only a couple doors down from the popular Saturday Dinette. Maybe--hey, what's going on with this quiet block I pass by too often year after year??  [TTC: 506 streetcars to Logan Avenue.]"}
{"text":"Coffee is really nice here. Lots of places to sit in the back. Very clean and quiet too. I especially love that they have an appreciation for Saudi dates (although a bit expensive)!"}
{"text":"Quaint little coffee shop in East Chinatown.  My friend and I stopped by here after seeing a show at Crow's Theatre and figured we could stop for a drink.  We both got the Hailed Cappuccinos and they were pretty good ($4.00+tax=$4.20).   The latte art was also cute.  I'd come back here to try the Turkish Coffee because I noticed they had that on the menu.  Seating is fairly limited (maybe 4-5 tables in the back and bar stool seats at the front)."}
{"text":"I had their latte and it was good. Very smooth flavour and not straight bitter like some places I've been to around this area. Would recommend. I would like to come back to try some of the foods and different types of dates that they offer.  Price wise it's a little pricey for the size but quality is there so that can be overlooked."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in the east end. You can do work it but I personally wouldn't recommend it. The tables are too small for my liking as I use my laptop and mouse and find the space to be very limiting. However, I believe this cafe is more meant for meetings or catching up with friends and family. Their selection of drinks is great and I'd just recommend coming here for a good conversation."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed quite a lot by this coffee shop. But since it's the only cafe open at the time I'm out the door I have no other choice, and wish I was getting my money's worth everytime (so expensive!!)  First time I tried their brewed coffee I literally thought I drank cat piss. Not sure if I keep getting a bad batch or something but it was really horrible. For a coffee place though this is something you should nail every time.  Their croissants are good, but again pricey which is fine.  I think this place only attracts people for it's \"Instagramable ness\" but that's all a load of shit to me because when you die, you don't wanna have a memory of that ok coffee you had that one morning... so why take a photo at all. Focus on what matters!! Like good caffeine!!!"}
{"text":"Cozy, welcoming and the coffee is exceptional It's 1 place I'd become a regular of if I lived in Toronto.."}
{"text":"I love the Kunafa! The staff is very friendly. They also have many new choices I'm looking forward to try."}
{"text":"Coffee is amazing. I just got a large drip coffee with a shot of vanilla and it was amazing. Great atmosphere, clean, unique and quiet. They had samples of dates and Arabic coffee for us to try which was really cool and interesting. Not that much space to sit but there are a couple of tables if you can manage to grab a spot !  Definitely stop by if you're going for brunch at Saturday dinette !"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop just opened up recently. The first location is in the east end, great to see it open up in the west end. Small location but great coffee. Good selection of croissants, desserts, dates, and chocolate."}
{"text":"Hailed is the definition of an aesthetically pleasing cafe. It is so crisp and clean and bright inside. Very contemporary as well as unique in its menu. Which is why it stands out so much from the endless amounts of independently owned coffee shops in Toronto. I got to try the signature caffeinated beverage, the cardamom cappuccino, and I have not stopped craving it since. This is a great and unique coffee shop, and definitely worth stopping by when you feel like you've visited a redundant amount of coffee shops in Toronto"}
{"text":"Great space, and friendly staff. The flowering jasmine iced tea is nice and refreshing on a hot summer day. It's paired nicely with their classic chocolate croissant. Their croissant is not the flaky French croissant, but still very good and not bready. The \"make it hailed\" cappuccino is really really good, with a hint of Cardamon. The Gruyere croissant is also fantastic! We will be back for more for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and lovely ambience! Also try their date cheese cake and their award winning chocolates! New favourite spot in Toronto.  Finally found a cafe that serves Arabic coffee."}
{"text":"Tiny coffee shop perched on the edge of what will be the Gerrard St entrance of College Park (currently undergoing extensive renovations). The brewed coffee + croissant combo rings in just under $5 and you can choose from a selection of croissants (plain, pain au chocolat, almond). There is a wall of chocolates, specialty dates and coffee beans. No seating inside the shop but I can imagine this being a place to grab a snack as you head into the newly updated College Park later this summer."}
{"text":"4.5  Well walked a round trip of 30 minutes in -7C (though sunny) to get to this bookmarked place. I can't say there was an even comparison to other coffees I've had because I decided to get their known Hailed latte (cardamom infused!). Not sure if it was the added flavor but it wasn't bitter at all. I should go back just to test out their plain Americano. But this was a tasty cuppa! I would recommend. I really didn't need to add sugar since the flavor was just enough.   I also had the  bechamel  croissant. Did not regret that choice at all. A pretty good croissant for sure, flakey, fluffy, soft, moist flavorful.... But I just minused the 0.5 because it's still not as good as my favorite croissant at cherry bomb and these were not made on site. But still pretty darn good. Id go back for seconds.  Decor is pretty simple, blank white walls, it would be nice to feature local artists work. Good service. I really hope they do well! Too bad they aren't along the busier queen street in leslieville but hey, I walked pretty far to try this place and it was worth it! It's a unique cuppa and can definately tell the cultural influence in this cafe."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Hailed Coffee! Their drinks are lovely, their food is delicious, and the bright white aesthetic can't be beat! It's a great place to study during the week if you can snag one of the three tall tables - otherwise you'll be balancing your laptop on your knees in the back. Definitely get your drink Hailed - the cardamom is delicious!"}
