{"text":"I would compare this restaurant to a diner you would find in New York or Massachusetts. Service was friendly even to us clearly Americans; and it felt like a locals joint and was the only place open at 4 nearby, so we trotted in and ordered a hamburger and a gyro. Both plates were satisfying but nothing spectacular. I am giving an extra star here because the service was very friendly for a part of town that doesn't seem to get many tourists."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this short. I went in their once, while I stood at the cash to order something to go the delivery driver counted out his float on the prep counter in front of the cash. THEY PREPARE FOOD THERE.  It was quite disheartening so I left without trying the food, and that is the real crime."}
{"text":"While headed to the biodome, after our initial breakfast option was out of business, we came to the choice between Gerry's and Roi D'Ontario. We almost fell for going to Gerry's, then we realized it was a suburban trap.   On to Roi. It's a total greasy spoon. And most of the menu probably isn't great (the beans were gross!). BUT, the crepes were amazing. So buttery, and just the right firmness for me, sitting next to a cup of real maple syrup. These were different than every other crepe I've had, resembling pancakes rather than crepes. I later found out these are the types they have in sugar shacks (ployes?). These were the best I've ever had, and for the rest of my trip I was longing for those crepes again. On my last day in Montreal, I only considered doubling back for here and Schwartz's. I'm not sure if this is a good place for a tourist to select as a destination, but I would like to know what a real Montrealer thinks about this place. I bet the poutine is pretty dirty good too.  Something interesting about Montreal is that there is pizza everywhere. In New York, pizza is only sold at Pizzerias and possibly Italian restaurants. In Montreal, most diners have separate pizza menus and a pizza oven, and there are lots of pizzerias too. I didn't dare try any because they didn't look that good, but next time I go I will let my curiosity take control of my stomach."}
