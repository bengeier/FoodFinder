{"text":"Last night was my first time at this restaurant. In fact, I thought that this was still the dodgy Blue Moon. Boy, was I wrong.   My friends wanted to check it out for dinner last night &  when we walked in, I was chocked by how different it looked. Way better! I loved the little date booths at the back and there was also a curtain at the back that was hiding stage. I'm assuming that after dinner, there was a band?   We had two tweens as part of our party but I would suggest that this is not a place for kids. The menu had a nice selection of items and our server was so wonderful! Even as the place started to fill up, he stayed attentive to our table. (I've been in so many situations where we have been left for dead)  I had the Butter chicken which, for $18, I expected chunks of chicken and not grizzly bits (sorry but I gagged). The rest of the party seemed fine with their food choice. I didn't hear any raving about future craving going on. (Mind you, the music was so loud that we wouldn't have been able to hear it anyway) The oysters were a hit and the devilled eggs were a surprise to see on the menu and turned out to be really good (I wish that I had taken a photo) The presentation of each dish was amazing!  I can't say enough about the service, it was really great!   **Hint: The stairs going to the washrooms lead into the ladies washroom. If you are a man, take a sharp right! :D ***"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks on Sunday night around 8:30pm  and wished we had come for dinner. The menu looks fantastic and for you fellow glutards, there are many GF options. The bartender Avary made us feel at home and clearly is a master of his craft. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner at the Riverside Public House tonight was fantastic. Two of us for dinner and we were amazed that they had our favourite beer on tap - which is rare.   The special tonight was in house smoked ribs with a loaded baked potato and coleslaw. The bones came out of the meat clean, it was likely the best ribs I have ever eaten. Hubby had the burger and said it was cooked perfectly and spiced the way he likes it. The fries were home cut and crispy.  We really like to hear that everything was made in house and the meat is from Rowe Farms.   All around a hit. The music tonight was some of my favourite 50's music so we were rockin' to Chantilly Lace while enjoying our food.  On Thursdays they have a Neil Young cover band and a DJ on Saturdays.   We will be back - glad to here that in mid September they will be open for lunch and possibly brunch on the weekends.   Next time I want to try the Halibut and Fried Vegetables."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 or 5 times and never really had a bad experience. If you're looking for good food, cocktails and a place to have a conversation, this is your place.   The Food - To be honest I've only ever had the burger and fries, which is fantastic. It's difficult to explore this menu further when I know I can have a great, juicy burger. That said, I do really want to try the Chicken & Waffles after reading other reviews.  The Atmosphere - Nice decor and good music. Anytime I've been it hasn't been too crazy - usually enough people around that it doesn't feel empty but not too many that it's hard to find a seat / table. I've even set up at the bar to do some work when I've been in the neighbourhood. Can be a good alternative to the always uber-busy Prohibition down the street.  The Staff - This has been a bit hit or miss in the past, but a lot better recently. The bar staff really know their drinks / beers able to give you the full walk-through.    I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Especially the fry chicken and waffles! Great service too. Got a little loud after 11pm but I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. I'm making this my Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Nice joint, and the food is amazeballs.  The chef is Sort Of A Big Deal and it shows. Between three of us we demolished four appetizers, each more wondrous than the last. Scotch egg, chantrelles and beans on toast, country pâté with house made pickles, welsh rarebit. Do these sound like things you should put in your face? Yes? Yes. I have every reason to believe the mains are equally great, and everything is locally sourced.  The place has that good, modern pub feel: wood, leather, dark paint, edison bulbs. There's a large amount of space and, if I'm not seeing things, there seems to be a dance floor/stage at the back for live music. For us on a Tuesday night it was cool and quiet and lovely.  Their beer list needs work, and is the only significant thing holding back that 5th star; I'd give them 4.5 if I could. This food and this atmosphere wants a nice tap/bottle list with some rich quebec dark ales and some clean ontario microbrews and a sharp belgian or two for variety. Instead there's a curious focus on BC beers (3 of 8 taps) and several of the bottle offerings (Sol, Dos Equis, Heineken) are pretty uninspired lightweights.  I really enjoyed this place. I'll be back. You won't go wrong to come here, especially if you're in the mood for pub-style food done really really well. If they fix their beer list, it gets a 5 from me without reservation.  Pro-tip: they make their own Worcestershire sauce. Put it on everything. Then drink what's left. Then steal the bottle to hide under your pillow."}
{"text":"Live around the corner and wanted to check out the new place in the neighborhood for a Saturday dinner. There were two of us, we sat down and ordered drinks (a glass of wine and a caesar) but waited over 20 minutes for them to come. The restaurant was not full, we had nothing on our table, but at least the waitress apologized for the long delay.   We ordered mushrooms on toast as an app, I asked for the fish of the day and my dining mate went for the burger. Our food took another 30m to arrive. The fish was cold, and burger was equally (if not less) tasty than the $6 burgers across the road at Dangerous Dans.  Total: Three standard drinks, one app and two mains. $90. Overpriced.  The food was not worth the wait nor the price. It's too bad, we had high hopes! Giving 2 stars as the decor wasn't bad."}
{"text":"RPH may be a new \"public house\" in my 'hood, but it ain't no prototypical pub/sports bar atmosphere. They may air live sports on their TVs, but you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone else who just want to hang out here just to watch a hockey game (if watching a game in mute over the soundtrack of loud music is your thing) over a few pints. Not a kind of place for that kind of thing though--why not? It is however fast becoming the closest thing the east end's got to a decent club as much as it already is nonetheless a decent bar to relax and hang out at.  RPH is best described as an upscale gastropub, the kind of place where you might want to have a small party or dinner with a large group of friends ready to splash some smiles and cash for a good dinner. It is very well-suited for that kind of use. There's also a stage/dancing area in the very rear.  It's not bad, actually overall. The place is very relaxed, filled with young professionals-types, and nearly pitch dark. Service can be spotty, but the staff are friendly and even chatty, at least when I'm around, if ever. The food and cocktails are pricey, but judging from the bill, the beer (a limited selection thus far) got a bit cheaper to make up for it.  It is here that I discovered the crazy concept of serving waffles with fried chicken. The chicken is tender and not too crispy, the way I like it. Drizzled with their spicy maple syrup, and complemented with savoury flakes of braised kale, it made the waffle and fried chicken that much more finger-lickin' good. They also make good burgers.  {TTC: Any Queen or King streetcar to Queen/Broadview}"}
{"text":"Can everyone stop raving about the chicken and waffles at Stockyards now, because the dish is done so much better here.  My friends and I wandered down Queen Street from Greenwood in search of a place to grab dinner. Most places were packed due to the new found warm weather, but Riverside was not. The back of the place was busy but were were able to seat our group of six at the front beside the open windows to the street.  Starting with cocktails, most of the group was pretty straight forward with most grabbing a pint or a gin and tonic. I went with my personal favourite, a dark & stormy. It was made well and went down smooth, other than the price. It was a few bucks more than what I'm used to paying, but considering the location, their cocktail prices are on par with similar venues.  It took a while for the meals to arrive, but when they did I was impressed. While most of the table ordered the burger, I grabbed the fried chicken and waffles. They must have a typo on their menu however. The description says \"buttermilk chicken, rum spiked waffles, veggies\". So you see, there is an extra \"s\" on \"waffles\". You only get one waffle which was the only thing that let me down with this plate.   The chicken was perfectly cooked. It was nice and crunchy on the outside and the meat was tender and juicy. The waffle was crisp and tasty, though a little small considering the size of the plate. The veggies were a mix of grilled zucchini, asparagus, and pearl onions.  Unfortunately I was the only one at the table to have something positive to say about their meal. While my friends drooled over my chicken, they had nothing positive to say about their meals. It actually made me enjoy mine a little less.  While I'm giving this restaurant/pub 4-stars its not really a place I would probably come back to or would recommend to others. The food in genreal doesn't stand out and nothing makes it better than any other restaurant other than the fried chicken. I think what it really came down to was the service. For what ever reason we had two different ladies serving our table. This led to them both coming to the table at different times asking about drink orders when we had already placed an order with the girl who stopped by a few moments earlier.   I don't really know how else to explain it other than frankly, the service just needs to be better."}
{"text":"Made a reservation a week in advance for 10 people after reading about it in the Globe and Mail. The day of, called to confirm and they didn't have it listed. Was no problem anyway since it wasn't busy for dinner. Food was ok overall but not worth the wait. It was over an hour between the time we ordered and when we were all served.  Our server was great, until we very gently complained about the food. Then she went cold - though did come around in the end.   The mussels on toast app was good but really salty. According to my companions, the fish special and hamburger were good.  Two of us ordered the chicken pot pie. It turned out to be a bowl of bitter garlic and chicken soup topped with pastry - and oddly, served with a fork. It was not a stew texture as one would expect in a pot pie. Rather, it was very thin and watery. We had to ask for a spoon. In the end, all I could taste was burnt garlic, so decided not to eat it. Instead I got fried chicken. Very salty and greasy - even for fried chicken - but ok. Really liked the crispy texture.   I probably wouldn't go back for dinner, but maybe would go for drinks and music later on in the evening."}
{"text":"Like the little brother of Prohibition Gastro house that just doesn't get enough attention. It's a great space they have and are stuck right in the middle of a very quickly improving trendy area but haven't really stepped up to the plate. The food is decent but pricey, the drinks are standard, TVs are wonky and the atmosphere is lacking. They have an opportunity to really compete in the area and draw big crowds. So far they have whiffed."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the neighbourhood. It is always a great meal and I love the Basil Smash. Truly a great cocktail. I have tried quite a few things. The devilled eggs are very tasty, as is the salad. For mains I have tried the burger which is excellent, the fried chicken which is very tasty and not at all greasy. I have has fried chicken in a few great restaurants and this is by far the best. The service can be slow but I enjoy a slower paced meal so it doesn't bother me at all. Some may find it too slow. They have bands now and then which are pretty good as well. All in all its a nice place to go to for a meal and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I have been back here 3-5 times since my original review, and I really like the restaurant. Late night on the weekend I probably wouldn't come here (a few times I have walked by and it's been packed), but if you come for dinner it's excellent.  Hilights: - There is something for everyone, even my picky, allergy-ridden Mother found more than one thing to order. NEVER. HAPPENS. - The service is usually pretty good - It's not super expensive - The bar menu is AWESOME - even if you're there for dinner ask to see it. There are different small plates than on the dinner menu, - The volume of the music is normal now (my previous #1 complaint - this is resolved)  Favorite dishes: stuffed quail, chicken and waffles, beef croquettes, asparagus from the side dishes.  I really like eating here, especially with guests who don't frequent the neighbourhood (it's usually busy but you can usually get a table)."}
{"text":"A lady bartender is awesome and makes great drinks. The Old Fashioned or Manhattan (can't remember) was great. She does a great job at it.   Unfortunately the other bartenders don't stack up. One guy was extremely rude and then started accosting us for a tip when we didn't tip. We didn't tip because he was really rude. I tipped the lady bartender $1-2 every time because she was friendly and made great drinks but if you're rude and then yell at us for a tip then I don't think so.   Some service people seem to think they can be rude and harass for tips anyways. One of these people is a bartender at this place. I asked another male bartender for Jameson on the rocks and I got some kinda paint thinner instead that costs $8. Some aficionados may argue that he probably brought me the right drink but I've had Jameson before and even though it's no reserve single malt it's not THAT terrible. Needless to say after those experiences I went back to the lady bartender since apparently she's the only one who knows how to tend bar there and does it well.   It's a nice space. I went here for an event called Toastr. I probably wouldn't choose to go back on a normal day but it's a good space for that event. Hopefully that same great bartender is working the next time I go (if I ever do) so that I can avoid the terribleness of last time."}
{"text":"And Riverside Public House is now gone.  Boots and Bourbon is there now.  Review pending."}
{"text":"I finally made my way Riverside Public House (@RiversidePublic) for an early dinner after not being able to made it to the opening event.  Dustin Gallagher have been enlisted to head the kitchen here where he had skillfully crafted an upscale English pub fare menu and being a big fan of Top Chef Canada, I was excited (^_^) We got there at around 6:00pm for an early Saturday dinner, it was no surprise that we were the first table but what's surprising was how the place remain empty even as we leave at around 8:00pm. Love the rich dark color of the leather booths    Daily Soup : Clam Chowder $7.00 ~ was thick and creamy  Ploughman's Platter $18.00 ~Everything here was great especially the pickled cauliflowers and we finish every bits of it ;) ~The liver mouse was very smooth whereas the chunkier terine was equally good. ~ Love the selection here where each item is different in both texture and flavor to the next   Porcini Mushroom Pie $18.00 ~This was delicious by all means, served pipping hot and the pastry just smell incredible.  ~Love the heirloom tomato on the side and how they served the dressing on the side in that cute little bottle, but wish there was a tiny bit more. On the menu it said it comes with a potato salad, but I'm glad it didn't since there was quite a bit of potato in the pie already. ~Perfect for the colder weather, very comforting. But thought it was quite a splurge for a pot pie with that price tag  ~Wish it was more of a pie with crust etc instead of just a puff pastry on top, which make me think how easy it'll be to duplicate this at home.  ~ Plus there just wasn't enough pastry to go with the fillings  :(    Country Fried Chicken $14.00 ~The coating was very crispy and light with hints of coriander, parprika and cumin flavors (at least that's what I think it is). The chicken itself was perfectly cook and incredible moist. But the potato salad was overdress and quite bland, that was the only thing we didn't finish :(    We were so full and had quite a bit of sweet stuff during the day, so we skip dessert.... but surprise, the bill comes with homemade caramel which was super delicious :)    Verdict : There's some hit and miss for us but I will def will come back for the fried chicken or maybe try their make to order Burger with their \"special sauce\""}
