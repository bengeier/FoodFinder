{"text":"Love this place! Sorry Ben thanh we traded you in for something better! Highly recommend this restaurant. I love the quality and quantity!"}
{"text":"I could have ranked the food about  2-3 stars because the flavor was not the worst I've had.  However, it was after leaving the restaurant and carefully looking at my bill when I was incredibly disappointed with my visit.  Sure, it was probably my fault for not spotting the discrepancy, but I am usually trusting the establishment I'm paying money to wouldn't exploit my patronage to gain an extra buck or two unearned.    I am not from the Charlotte area so I understand Mecklenburg County may have some different taxing rates.  But based on my bill (a photo of which has been uploaded), the restaurant charged me 12% of my total bill for tax.  I'm pretty sure this tax rate is not used ANYWHERE in North Carolina as I also have over 10 years of experience in the service industry.  I'm also not one to quibble over a couple of dollars, but with the big picture and assuming they might engage in this overtaxing practice regularly, your average customer is being completely ripped off.  Maybe it was completely arbitrary but whatever the case, I generally have a standard to not go someplace that not only is untrustworthy, but seems to not care whether or not they have won me over as a customer by blatantly cheating on my bill.  Bottom line: check your bill carefully!  Or better yet, just go to Truc on Tryon Road where the service and food are both better."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've ever eaten. The broth is the perfect balance of flavor and the price and quantity of food you get is great."}
{"text":"Best pho in Charlotte. Hands down. Their broth has incredible flavor and the service is great! A must try!"}
{"text":"Ok, there are at least 8 other pho places I would go to before I go here. Their food is not disgusting, it just severely pales in comparison to the plethora of Vietnamese restaurants in this city. The broth was not to my liking as it had a very strong anise flavor and lacked the rich beef flavor that I prefer.   If a friend suggested we go here, I'd unfriend them in real life. I just...can't. I can't."}
{"text":"Not saying that I am a Pho expert but I have been to a couple of great authentic places and I do like this place a whole lot. Great prices, and you should know its legit when locals come to eat out. Great Bowl of Pho!! The prices are great $8 for a XL bowl of Pho. Also, you have to order the Rice Paper Shrimp and Pork Rolls.  Will for sure go back again!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pho and a tofu fresh wrap, both were delicious and flavorful. The service was amazing as well. I would recommend this place and would definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the older side but set up wwll for the space. I noticed right away that there isn't much veggie friendly options as I thought, but I'm not a vegetarian so it's ok. I don't eat pork and I do see a lot of that on the menu. I ordered a #11 medium size; hold the bbq pork. The TV was on sportscenter channel. I didnt notice until after i started eating that the grade is a B. 82.5, so its a low B at that. I was very disappointed. Pho was good thus the star. I can walk to this location so I will return to try the seafood chow main I saw on the menu if the grade changes."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a youngin' and absolutely love this place. The portions here are huge and the prices are unbeatable. I have tried just about everything on the menu. My absolute favorites ate the vermicelli bowls and Bun Bo Hue. I love the pho also, but that's pretty much a given. Definitely come check this place out. The neighborhoods doesn't look so nice here, but who the eff cares? The food here kicks serious butt!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and the first time was great! I had the buon bo hue and it was the best I've had in a long time at a restaurant.  Very flavorful and spicy.  The second time I went, we went closer to closing.  I ordered the same thing in a medium bowl and there was barely any noodles in my bowl.  I took two bites and I was done.  My mom ordered a medium pho dac biet and she received a large serving of noodles but all the herbs were brown and wilted.  She pointed it out to our waitress who was rude back saying \"that's the prettiest one you are going to get\" and walks away.  Her pho was also ok not great.  Between the experience and food we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a very cute place.  It has a very welcoming atmosphere that you can feel when you walk in.  The people are really friendly and are willing to help someone new to this type of food, like I am.  The food was really good.  Very fresh and spiced just right.  It's a great place to come and hang out and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Do NOT buy your Vietnamese Coffee from Pho An Hoa. I paid $4 for 9 oz of coffee.  Most Vietnamese Restaurants that sells Vietnamese coffee usually cost $3.50 for 16 oz. The coffee was good but I would rather go to Le's Sandwich and get my money's worth of Vietnamese coffee. I got my coffee to go so the portion might be different if you dine in."}
{"text":"Best pho in Charlotte that I've had, and I've had a lot of pho. Beef is tender and seasoned and broth is flavorful. Very friendly helpful staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The Best Pho in town! Family atmosphere and friendly staff. The best part is they remember us when we come in regardless of how long it's been since we were here last. This is my go to restaurant when I'm feeling down because it feels like home away from home, my comfort food, my comfort place."}
{"text":"I have such a difficult time rating Pho restaurants because nothing can ever compare to Momma's pho. I do have to admit that Pho An Hoa does do a good job of satisfying my cravings when Momma isn't around or if she is scarce for ingredients. I always order the same thing - Pho Dac Biet, Medium with extra limes.. ALWAYS. I love that Pho An Hoa gives a plethora amount of herbs and bean sprouts. Service is always great and the food is always consistent.  Tip: Grab a bowl of pho when you're hungover, I promise you will thank me later :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to get to try some authentic Vietnamese Pho - it came quickly, steaming hot, and very large portions! Sadly, I discovered once again that I don't really like all Vietnamese food. I'm sure it's very good for someone who likes it, but I've already known for a while that it's not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Vietnamese places in my life time and all have been very authentic so going out here in Charlotte I was searching for something authentic to follow suit. Pho An Hoa is actually right next door to another very popular Vietnamese restaurant but the hubby and I chose to go here instead because it's new to the area, and there were several Vietnamese families in there so in all honesty that right there sold me. Who would know better about a Vietnamese restaurant then Vietnamese people?! The service was great, never had an empty cup and had everything I needed without having to ask for it. I got a bowl of Pho, made mostly of beef and it was delicious and to date has been the best I've had. It was very flavorful and had all of the fixings. The prices are perfect, it's not overpriced and it would be perfect for someone on a budget. This will be my new Pho spot and I recommend it to anyone else who enjoys Vietnamese food! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pho hands down & they are always so friendly. Why someone would give 4 stars for not having a veg friendly pho is beyond me - maybe don't get pho? If you want legit broth perfectly seasoned this is your spot."}
{"text":"Location is probably the only downside. We call this place \"Bullet-hole\". But seriously, there's a bullet hole in one of the windows.   My Asian friends swear by this place's pho. Trust the Asians, go where they go. Lang Van is chock full of white folk, and oddly enough their pho isn't nearly as good as Pho An Hoa. I always go with the classic: Pho Dac Biet. The broth here is so, so good. Not too sweet, not too salty. But seriously, the broth is where it's at.  Side note: if you're meeting someone make sure you specify the \"An\" part of the name. There's \"Pho Hoa\" right down the road, also on Central."}
{"text":"OK but not definitely worth returning.. The broth did not have the home made authentic taste to it. Feels Fake. It is given as diluted a lot. The chilli paste on the table is too oily. In a strip mall in the Hispanic, less nicer  part of town. Cost of medium is $8.50.Small portion size. for the price."}
{"text":"Great service and great pho! I am more of a fan of their mi, though, and be warned that the portions are HUGE. The waitresses are really friendly. Low, low, low key place. Nice hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Best taro bubble tea I've had in forever, possibly in my life! That's how I started my meal at Pho An Hoa this past week with the most bubbly and fun group of Charlotte Yelper's! I couldn't help loving this group of people and the restaurant. A hole in the wall to be sure but with an incredible broth in their pho! I started with an order of fresh shrimp and pork spring rolls which was A-OK. Definitely tasty and nothing to ding them on, but not the most flavorful or protein forward that I've tried. The taro bubble tea was a different story! The bubbles were perfect, not squashy and fleshy from sitting too long but with great texture and honey-flavor. If you've never tried taro, do it! It's an Asian root that is the most Easter shade of purple imaginable.   A cold and rainy evening screams pho, so I went with the #1 (deemed the 'most popular' on the menu). Tribe, rare flank, meatballs and fatty brisket all served in a bed of noodles and incredible beef broth. Throw in some bean sprouts, basil leaves, lime and jalapeno with your choice of table sauces and you are in for a treat. Next time I will go with the non-most popular pho: number 4 or 5 would be my future pick. I gave tripe another try, but alas I don't like to crunch into my meat. I also wasn't a fan of the super fatty pieces of meat. Aside from these facts, the child's portion was perfect paired with a drink and overall a great value! Can't wait to return and try some other items from the menu; I could see Pho An Hao becoming a regular spot! Great food and awesome service all around."}
{"text":"I guess with 39 check ins, I should write a review for An Hoa... I mean it has been 3 years since I wrote my review and it is in need of an update.  What has changed? Absolutely. Nothing. And I'm glad that it hasn't. My experience here has always been stellar. What do I get now? Oh you know, the same. However, I ask for a few more side dishes to go along with my Pho. So you want to know that inside secret don't you? I see that my review actually went long lengths for this restaurant and I'll let you readers know what's good.  So what does it for me was something one of my Vietnamese friends told me to do. He said that you had to get some sliced onions mixed with red vinegar, then together that and meat with some noodles and eat it all at once. My mouth is literally salivating for it right now. Hey, you don't have to do what I say, but I'm just letting you know, it's pretty awesome. To me, it brings the flavor out in the combination between the meat, noodles, broth, and some mixture of the dipping sauce you use with the meat. If you want to know my combination, well you'll just have to keep reading!  Overall, Pho An Hoa keeps delivering for my family and I. And I don't plan to quit on going anytime soon. This place has probably been the most stable for me and my pho cravings and will continue until further notice."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. It's in a little bit of a sketch neighborhood, but it's soooooo worth it. Like most of these authentic Vietnamese restaurants, service gets straight to the point, I wouldn't strike up a conversation with my server or anything like that. They're really friendly and extremely fast. I stick to my regular items, as follows:  Combination pho: In my opinion, they have the best broth in Charlotte. Decent portion of meat in your pho. They add \"nuoc beo\" (fat water) to the broth, which gives it more flavor.  Bun bo hue: On a scale of 1 to 10 for spiciness, I'd say it's a 5. Broth is super flavorful, and again, decent portion of meat.  Papaya salad: OMG, soooooo good. It's a little spicy. It comes with super delicious Asian beef jerky. My mouth is watering jus thinking about it.  Avocado smoothie: Also amazing. It's thick, rich and creamy. They must use at least half of a real avocado to give it that rich texture. Good level of sweetness in my opinion, standard for more Asian smoothies/boba teas, maybe a tad less sweet than that. They give it to you in a to go cup too, so if you're too full from the pho, you can just take it with you."}
{"text":"Time and time again, this is where I get my pho fix.  I get their combination beef pho, XL size.  Because why not?  It's always my favorite thing there.  Last time, I made a slight miscue by trying something new, and underestimating the Bun Bo Hue.  Pretty spicy, that I couldn't enjoy it as much because I was sweating bullets.  Time to go back to the basics.  But recently, I discovered their Green Papaya Salad.  What a revelation.  I'm shocked that I didn't discover this earlier -- spicy shredded beef served over thinly sliced papaya makes for a nice kick and tang.  It's by far one of my favorite dishes to order in Charlotte, period.  If I ever leave Charlotte, this is one of the foods I'll miss the most, and definitely one I'll come back for."}
{"text":"I got the medium shrimp and meatball pho and taro bubble tea for to go. they added up to $13. The bubble tea is pretty good, has a rich condensed milk flavor instead of just powder. The broth is very comfy, but a bit salty. Overall, it is a good place for fast pho stop."}
{"text":"I love Bun Bo Hue ! I always come here cuz of that bow. Pho is good also, I often oder with Hanh Tran and vinegar onion on side. Staffs are nice , they can remember which dish you like on next time you come! One thing I don't like that too old music they play"}
{"text":"We wanted some Pho because he was feeling under the weather. We usually go to two different spots, but decided on going to a place closer and new. We looked up the closest one and this came up with four stars! So we drove literally three minutes down the street. When we first walked in, it looked like most pho restaurant and had about four tables already sat. After we ordered we were looking around and I noticed how DIRTY it was. We sat next to a wooden block (a support beam?) and it was covered in splashed food. The condiments on the table were also caked in fingerprints. Ew. We wanted to leave but since we already ordered we stayed. After we got the food I went to check in on Yelp. The sanitation score is horrible!!! Below 90... what had we gotten ourselves into?!   The Pho was alright, not the worst. But definitely not the best I have had. The broth is way darker than other restaurants as well, and a little thicker.   I will definitely NOT be coming back.   P.S. He picked this place and did not look at the sanitation score before we sat... we would not have stayed if we have known the score!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town! A little hole in the that's worth driving to. Forget about all the other Vietnamese spots... this is THE spot in Charlotte for authentic Vietnamese. I recommend the avocado shake with boba, any pho (they actually have an extra large size!), green papaya salad, and of course, the spring rolls. Friendliest service and great food."}
{"text":"One of the better pho places in Charlotte! Great pho at a cheaper price compared to some places in Charlotte. Their spring rolls are great too. Of course it's not like Atlanta or west coast good, but if you're in town and want good authentic pho and not care about the interior decorating, then come here."}
{"text":"Good pho, bad Thai tea.  I will not be returning back since the Thai tea I've ordered had ground coffee in them (hoping in was ground coffee) It looked dirty and wasn't a pleasant taste. I don't like wasting anything but I threw that one away. 3 stars for good pho but they advertise a size XL like it was bigger than a large... nope - it's just a large."}
{"text":"A big bowl of pho was just what the doctor ordered. I guess technically what I ordered wasn't pho, but it was a big bowl of awesome. I had the #12 - seafood vermicelli soup and I also ordered some vegetarian rolls to share. Both were delicious.   The restaurant is small and the servers are prompt. I love Ben Thanh, but this place is better I'm afraid."}
{"text":"My go-to pho spot in Charlotte. Parking sucks at times during peak chow down hours. Butttt, the pho broth and meat it on point."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho in the uptown area and just about the Charlotte area. The family that owns and runs it are very nice and attentive. The Pho broth is amazing! This is a total \"hole in the wall\" kind of establishment, but if you are a fan of Pho, it won't matter. I often call and order take out, especially on cold winter evenings. Best hangover helper too BTW, ha!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Giving it a 4 star review because they do not serve a vegetarian friendly pho.  Only use chicken or beef broth.  Oh well, few veggie friendly options on the menu.  We got tofu spring rolls - Very good. For our entrees we ordered veggie stir-fry and tofu, one with rice and one with egg noodles.  They were flavorful and portioned well.  They only had califlower and bok choy on them, still very flavorful.   The staff was very friendly and we had a pleasant time.  Unfortunately no vegetarian pho :-("}
{"text":"My go to place for Pho! Small and not the most nicely decorated place but the food is fantastic! Parking is difficult on weekends."}
{"text":"We were pretty happy to find this place in South Charlotte. Everything was good. Mom liked the fried rice a lot. Vermicelli was also good to me. Ohh the also have soup if you order rice... nice"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this pho restaurant for at least 14 years now, they have gone a LOOONG way since I first came here. If i were to review them 14 years ago, I would have probably given them 2 stars for sanitation. I was just there for dinner tonight, I checked their sanitation score which is 93, it's acceptable for an ethnic vietnamese restaurant that used to be a hole in the wall place.   They put up curtains, put covers on the chopsticks and included a variety of sauces on each table. The only thing I have to warn you about is they only have one person running the kitchen and one server only...so if there are a lot of people in the restaurant(dinner time), things gets slow and hectic.   We wanted bubble teas but were told they can't make them...ok. Ordered the papaya salad, it was ok for $6, tasted kinda like pad thai but green ripe papaya instead of noodle.  Ordered #15 egg noodle with wonton, shrimp and pork. The broth was a tad salty, but overall pretty good for $8.50, the XL side. I would recommend a medium if you are moderately hungry and only and XL if you are DYING for food.  The price here is probably the best for pho, you can get a children's pho bowl for $5, then small for 7.50, medium 8.00, extralarge is 8.50. I think their best items are their noodle soup bowls. What is great about this place is that they do not charge extra for egg noodles, they have a whole category of noodle bowls that let you choose the noodle you want."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great experience and wonderful flavor. Plentiful servings and very relaxed atmosphere. Not expensive!!!"}
{"text":"The broth of their Pho is amazing. Plus you can get a side of meatballs in broth or extra thinly cut steak to add in to your Pho!  Their fresh rolls are super flavorful! Probably the best.  Definitely a hole in the wall feel, but the employees remember you and service is speedy. Eaten here multiple times in a week and made me happy every time."}
{"text":"The flavor certainly isn't bad but it's probably a little too salty for my taste and with ben thanh next door it's hard to see why you'd go to pho an hoa but variety is the spice of life."}
{"text":"i eats alot of Pho but this place is the best i never have by far the beer broth is flavorful is amazing how broth soup can make Pho good or bad !!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Charlotte !!! They are all about the Pho here and thats good for us. Their focus on their craft; constantly produces a tasty , hearty noodle soup that on a cold, damp day... will save your soul! Service is great and the food comes out as fast as you can go wash your hands and come back sometimes; making one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"I'll just go ahead and sum up what you need know here: the pho comes in so many different sizes, including child's and extra large. I'll wait while you all start to slow clap.   We put Christi K and Adam R in charge of picking us a place to eat after our kickoff event for our Yelp's Fit Club series. Since mother nature apparently didn't realize it was the first day of Spring, it was chilly and perfect pho weather.   This place is one of those amazing strip mall gems in Charlotte. It's right by another another QC SMG, Cedar Land. It's not fancy at all, but the food is delicious and the staff so friendly. Such a warm and welcoming vibe.   I wanted to soup and vermicelli, so I decided on wonton soup and a grilled pork, shrimp, and fried roll vermicelli bowl. The broth on the soup was delicious. My noodle bowl, huge and delicious. I had enough to make two meals out of it. Christi and Rose both got child size phos. I laughed when they ordered them, but they really were the perfect size for the ladies. The boys decided to be boys and get extra larges. Holy. I could probably have drowned in one of those. The avocado boba was really good. Rose loved her taro bubble . I didn't get to try it, but it sure was pretty and purple-y. It's on my list to try next time. I was cold, so I went with just a pot of regular ole hot tea.   Tonya P has already decided that we need to go here for a late breakfast and get child size phos. Okay, twist my arm. I'm in!"}
{"text":"I can't believe some of these reviews. Yes, it's authentic. Yes, there's a strong anise scent in the broth. Yes, they use fish sauce. Again, it's AUTHENTIC! If you don't like pho or any Vietnamese food, you shouldn't write a review on it. I've been coming here almost 20 years and it hasn't changed. Same delicious broth, same sweet mango bubble tea, same savory fried spring rolls. My teens have been coming here with me since they were old enough to eat solids. The service can be hit or miss. If Tena is working, you're taken care of. If she's off, you may or may not get a refill - depends on which gentleman is there. But don't let that deter you - the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I love the pho here. The broth was flavorful and the meat was soft not chewy. The boba when I had it was ok. The spring rolls are really good here too. It has both pork and shrimp in it!"}
{"text":"Second Best pho in Charlotte...it's the cheapest. They do not skimp on the meat either.  Saigon Bay has surpassed them however in my current Charlotte rankings."}
{"text":"Good timing with service. The star anise is a little strong in the broth. Very fresh herbs. Best spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the pho was good, but very authentic, which to me can be a bit heavy on the fish sauce. The place was a bit dirty and the b sanitation rating was a bit off putting."}
{"text":"Excellent service, prices, food and options on drinks, apps and even beers. I had a Pho bowl combination and spring rolls with egg soda and coconut bubble tea to cap it off. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My standards for Vietnamese is very high. With extensive travel experience in the region I know I am probably being overly knit picky. Ordered some fresh summer rolls to go and to be honest they were disappointing compared to other rolls I have had from other Vietnamese places here and Charlotte and elsewhere. The pork was tasteless, there were not many vegetables/herbs and the shrimp was rubbery. Perhaps the quality of ingredients explains why they charge significantly less than other places for the same product. I'll pass and head up the street to another establishment. Might go back to try their pho."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident one day I wasn't feeling well and wanted soup...I think this place sells the next best thing to Jewish penicillin...chicken soup. There's was a seafood pho, I took mine to go like I said cause I was sick got home combined the broth with the submersibles and got into the zone. Made some for my son who as an almost adult can get finickie but he inhaled his as well."}
{"text":"So this place is delicious . Its in a not so hot location , but the food was just what I wanted . The food came out fast and tasty . I enjoyed the menu because it wasn't too long . I had the spring rolls with shrimp and pork with peanut sauce , delicious ! I also ordered the #20 vermicelli noodles with shrimp and beef with some oil and fish sauce , it has cucumbers , and sprouts , and comes with a chopped up fried egg roll . This bowl was fresh very tasty , always one of my favorites. Simple but excellent . I also had the Taro boba shake , perfect sweet drink . If you want good Vietnamese go here , you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We use to come here.. it was lunch time and the place wasn't even packed. It used to be so busy. What happened to this place? Vermicelli sauce wasn't salty, spicy, our sour. It was just sweet. Had to add more fish sauce. Pho wasn't up to the hype anymore.  I ordered this pink drink on the menu and the waiter didn't even know the name of it. He just said it had coconut milk in it. He gives me a WHITE drink with coconut flavor and green jelly. Jelly was good... but I could taste the fat from the coconut. I assumed it was powdered mix of coconut so I said I didn't want the drink anymore.   Basically it wasn't what the picture presented. How can you advertise something that you can't recreate clearly? The waiter was just like \"oh okay. hold on. leme me go ask\" with no look of concern. The larger man which i assume is the boss?? Didn't even introduce himself, asks, what the problem is? We tell him that this wasn't what we expected comparing it to the menu... we can taste the coconut powder because there was LUMPS in the drink.   He interrupts me to tell me everything they make here is fresh and they don't use coconut powder in the drink. Okay... good for you but there's lumps in the drink. I don't care if you do or don't use powder... there is chalky white stuff in the drink. Every Asian knows how a good coconut dessert drink should have and not have. Regardless if you use powder... mix it enough so it can dissolve. If its the milk or cream... make sure you mix it or don't get the top part of it. It's the coconut fat. I mean how do I describe this to a boss who clearly was having a bad day already. He offered us a new drink and I just don't want it. So he says okay thats fine. Turns around and just throws it away. Like DAMN. Listen a customer and check the damn drink. LOOK at IT. I wasn't lying. This type of drink shouldn't have particles of coconut floating around.  Also, we had the Boba smoothie it was good BUT the boba was SO HARD. How can you say you make everything fresh but serve us hard boba? Yes you might make it fresh (cook to order) but are the ingredients fresh? I'm more mad about the attitude of the man. He was quite rude and he seem to rush us to pay. He didn't come back to say sorry he was just mad.  And yes, I did tip 20%. But that's only because of the total of the bill. The service was very passive and the man did not show empathy.   Will not be returning. Go to Saigon Bay or Saigon Palace. Good food, nice people."}
{"text":"This place is a good choice for Vietnamese. It's a fast, cheap, hole in the wall. Nothing fancy about it. Just good food. I may have had more flavorful broth at other Vietnamese restaurants like Ben Thanh next door and Vietnam Grille on South Blvd."}
{"text":"Great Pho!   The location is very humble, but their food is amazing!   Great hole in the wall for good Vietnamese food.   I've been once, but will be back. Their shrimp/pork spring rolls with peanut sauce were amazing!  Service was efficient, but not above and beyond. Just simple, straight to the point."}
{"text":"I [heart] this place!  Thank goodness Kristi and Adam made a joint effort in choosing where to eat this one night - I was just a tag-along.    Located off of Central, next to Cedar Land... in a very unassuming strip mall, this place is the definite go-to for Pho or Vietnamese cuisine.  It was definitely cold and starting to rain, so I went straight up Pho (#4) EXTRA LARGE.  It was a little intimidating ordering that size and we found it funny the sizes went:  CHILD, SMALL, MEDIUM, EXTRA LARGE!  Even got a bite of their spring roll, which was amazing.  My friends ordered some shakes as well, that looked quite good (since they disappeared so quickly after arriving at the table).  The staff... made you feel like a guest in their home.  Super friendly service and great tips on ordering if you are unsure.  We were having so much fun we over-stayed!  On Sundays they close at 9pm and we were still having such a good time past it, but they never said anything and made sure we were taken care of.   It was only after we saw someone putting the chair up on the tables that we realized what time it was.  Our bad!"}
