{"text":"Went there on Sunday the World Cup.  Took 20 minutes before a server took our drink order.  Said the management decided to cut staff today!!!??  insteading of adding more for the game...hmm...Then took another hour to get our meal.  Food was ok once we got it."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night for some wings and beer. I guess we had a waitress as evidenced by the fact that some menus were thrown on the table, but I ordered the food at the bar and spent the night walking back and forth for pitchers of beer (it was funny at first but got old quick)  we did not see the waitress until we were getting about ready to leave... she came by and asked us how we were doing! I have had crappy service before, but never non-existent. Anyways the bartender was very friendly, I wouldn't go back though, there are SO many of the exact same bar by different names where a waitress will actually bring the beer to your table for you."}
{"text":"Tipp's is your average pub, but it doesn't go beyond that.

Food: The food selection is typical pub fare. The preparation and presentation is decent on most items but some, like tacos leave something to be desired in both flavor and quality.

Beer: Typical domestic selection. Try to hit the specials since the normal prices are on the high side: $7/pint. That being said the specials are usually not that \"special\" either.

Service: Waitresses are friendly but on the slow/inefficient side...

Lot's of TVs to watch the games and 2 pool tables."}
{"text":"The search for a great Irish pub in Calgary does not end at Tipperary's. I'm  not sure it should even start there. There's little evidence of any Irish-inspired dishes on the menu. Instead there are pictures of scantily-clad women that might make sense at the kitchen of a rundown strip club, but not here. It appears the owners borrowed the menus and figured nobody would be able to tell the difference.
I've been there a few times and have yet to receive a decent meal. It has never been particularly appetizing, nor has it ever been served the way I ordered it. Every time I've eaten there, the servers tried their best to make me feel like I was inconveniencing them by offering them money for goods and services.
The lack of Irish meals makes sense now if they're just calling it Tipperary's Pub, dropping the word Irish from the name. That's a step in the right direction, but then what's with the shamrocks everywhere?
The place does attract a fair crowd of locals on weekend nights to watch sports and knock back a few. Go there if you find yourself in the area and are craving a cold beer, but avoid the food."}
{"text":"Average quality food, usually reasonable service, dark interior.  Why four stars? The pizza is one of the best parlour style pizzas in town, with a thick crust that is cooked up nicely crispy on the bottom, a zesty sauce, and generous toppings (meat lover's is highly recommended) without being too greasy.  Best of all, on Tuesday evenings they are half price!"}
{"text":"My go-to for nachos and a lot of other pub food. Always delicious and service is generally great. Parking is not great. Fortunately, it is close to the train. Highly recommend Tips."}
{"text":"We popped in here on our way home one evening after another event.

It was a Wednesday evening so it wasn't overly busy.  Our service was fine... at first.  We seated ourselves and it didn't take too long for someone to bring menus and take our drink orders.  Our drinks took a bit and the server came back to ask us a question regarding one.  At that point I decided to change my order and asked if they were being made yet.  She said no and that the bartender would probably be glad I changed my mind(I was going to get a blended drink, but decided on a martini).  I don't really care if a beverage is a pain in the ass to make... I don't want to basically be told I'm a pain in the ass customer because I ordered that.  

Moving on.  We ordered sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo and the lobster mac n cheese with bacon on top to share.  The fries were far too salty, but still yummy.. and it is pub food after all.  I found them spicy, but that seems to be the norm with yam or sweet potato fries everywhere lately.  The lobster mac n cheese was pretty good.  It had real bacon on top.  I'm not a fan of bacon so hubby had mine.  The food was definitely edible.

The service, on the other hand, sucked. We waited for ever for our food.  We waited for condiments, for utensils for one of us, for our tab,for dessert etc.  The ice cream on the dessert was terrible.  You could tell it had melted and been refrozen.  It tasted and felt terrible to eat.  I ordered another drink(and so did my hubby)and we ended up leaving without getting them it took so long.  Thankfully we were not charged for them.  We asked for water and never got them.  The service was terrible.  I would not go back.  Definitely would not recommend them for large groups.  We were only two people and they couldn't serve us adequately."}
{"text":"I would not go here again. My husband and I seated ourselves and waited approximately 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Our food took another 45 minutes. Throughout dinner we were accosted by flies. At one point, a fly took to my beer and proceeded to meet it's death inside of it. The server offered to replace the drink, but by then we were done our meal and I said no that's fine. She didn't take it off of our bill so we asked for it to be taken off since I had only drank 1/2 of it before the fly flew in it and she checked in with us again. She asked me if the fly was in there before which was weird. I wouldn't have drank it if it was...Anyways she finally got it off. But overall it took forever to get served, forever to get our food - steak sandwich and bison burger, and forever to even pay!"}
{"text":"American visiting Calgary: honestly could not tell you why this place isn't rated higher. Tried the fried pickles, sirloin, and wings. Everything was fantastic, especially the steak. Staff is friendly and fun. Highly recommended. P.S. NFL network on for every game!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular in the past and am a regular again.

They have certainly upgraded their menu selection since I was here last and their latest offerings are surprisingly good, rivalling gastropubs but without the pretentiousness.  It may not have the polish of some of the trendy bars downtown but it is seems like one of the hidden gems that only friends tell you about.

It is a great neighbourhood pub where everybody knows your name.  They have just introduced a $5 Appy Hour where you have 5 different items you can select for 5 dollars.  Try the Pizza Rolls!  The Hummus and Veg is great value too.

Tuesday is their pizza special and I hit that every Tuesday for three months.  I am not kidding!

Every day they have a special no matter what your tastes are.  And they must have a soup expert in the back because I have never been disappointed by the soup here.  I never even heard of an egg & sausage soup but it is to die for."}
{"text":"Ah good ol' Tipps. I'm actually surprised I have yet to review this or check in, as we're here way too often. Def a local watering hole for us and some friends. If there is an event we always have the back room, or we'll come for wing night. 

Sadly I can't eat too much here, but I can drink so that is really all that matters and they have good fries! HAHA. 

it's typical pub, it's broken into two sides, one more lounge with VLT's and so forth. It's a good place if you're in the area and looking for some quick eats."}
{"text":"Tipperary's is A-OK, and, well... that's about it.

They have the average menu items, at the average quality, at the average price you'd expect. They play your average music mix at an average volume you'd expect. They have all the average beer you would expect no more, and no less.

OK... The PIZZA is a standout. Enough to make the whole place stand out? Well, it's doubtful.  But the pie is stone oven cooked, and the herb infused crust stays crisp, even under the layers and layers of ham, sausage, and pepperoni on the Meat Lovers. Pretty impressive.

While I don't have any reason not to go to Tipperary's, I'm also struggling to find anything that makes it special."}
{"text":"the following description is of my experience at the restaurant getting the service of the restaurant: 

ordered blackend steak strips.  Steak came raw on the inside and black outside.  I think it was frozen and cooked from frozen at very high heat.  We couldn't eat it and spit back raw pieces of meat.  What came back was pieces of meat all stuck together, pounded out and then stuck together back again, including chewed up pieces.  Someone never told these people to make a new entree once they screw up, not to try to serve dogfood to customers.  Needless to say I wouldn't pay for it and we left shortly afterwards to give our business to another place."}
{"text":"Good pub, too bad they don't have a patio. Happy hour is fantastic, the food is pretty good for pub food, and having one side that's kid friendly before 8pm is kind of handy. The lounge side is always closed off to kids. Great friendly place to pop in for a drink and a bite."}
{"text":"Well it's a pub alright.

First off, I don't really have anything against Tipperary's. That being said, it never really gave me a reason to like it either. I came here for a birthday party and was pleased there was a lot of seating until I looked at the menu. It was pretty much everything I expected to see for about the prices I thought was normal. Nothing was cheap or even really that original. The service was alright from a waitress who seemed like she just wanted to do her job.

It's an okay place, but I don't really see a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Ordered the perogies....looked good but was tricked. They were displayed nicely but they were all burnt on the other side. We got another plate. When we got the bill it was indicated as comp`d but then billed again.  Dark irish pub the way I like it except the food in the irish pubs I frequent is really good."}
{"text":"Waitress was a crank. Charged me pop price (2.75) for a soda water even though we were with guys who were eating and drinking. I can't positively review a place that doesn't support designated drivers. Will never return to this idiocy."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 went here for breakfast Sunday at about 11am. We will be back because we sat right away and the servers were quick and friendly. This was probably because it wasn't busy and I don't see why, the food was fairly cheap and hot. Everyone was satisfied."}
{"text":"good pub food and ceaser's were great.  it was not busy on a sunday and service was good."}
{"text":"I feel foolish because this place is on my way home and I've only been twice.
And yet I look at their digital sign on the outside of the building telling you the daily features every day I drive by and think to myself that I should totally go snag one of their great deals.
So I finally went again, and it was awesome!
We went for a UFC fight ($10 cover - reasonable), and got a great private little booth with views of about 7 tv screens without barely turning my head, so that was a huge plus!
Then it turns out it was steak sandwich night - I think it was $8 and the large sirloin that came was tender, cooked correctly, and super flavorful (must have been a marinade).
My draft beer was only $5 or $6 too, which was a score, because a lot of places jack up their prices for televised events.
See my pic for their happy hour features - up to date as of Sept 2017."}
{"text":"Came here before the stamps west quarterfinals and they were packed but we got a table and ordered our brunch. 

It took is over 45 mins for our food to arrive. I got the burgers benny which was very good. The price was also great. Based on food alone I would've rated 4 stars. However, it took us another 30 mins to get and pay our bill. I understand the waitress was busy, but it's inexcusable. We ended up walking up to the bar to ask for our bill and pay. Parking available underneath the pub. Lots of tv's and pool tables as well."}
{"text":"Not impressed.

Unfortunately I need to update my previous great review of Tipperary's. I usually only come here for the wing special on Wednesday, but I work out of town and am never home on Wednesday's. Last night was the first time in a while I've been home, so we ventured over to Tipp's in hopes we would have some delicious, cheap wings.

It was very busy when we arrived, which was to be expected. We weren't really acknowledged when we walked in, but we quickly found a table and a waitress tended to us right away. We ordered drinks and waited, I went to the bathroom and returned, waited some more. Finally our drinks arrived. At this point we ordered our food. Our wings took a VERY long time. About 45 minutes after sitting down, we got our food. The wings were awesome, as usual, and after a couple more drinks we asked for our bill. SHE TOOK MY HALF FULL DRINK WITH HER! WTF!? I said bring the bill, not I'm done with my drink. Once she brought the bill, we knew it would take forever for her to come back so we went over to the bar to pay. Another waitress ended up taking our payment and our waitress didn't even acknowledge us leaving, no 'thank you!' or 'have a good night!'.

I do find the food at Tipperary's to be good. But the service needs a MAJOR change before I'll come back or recommend this place to others. Sadly, two regular customers left disappointed and probably won't return for a while."}
{"text":"Tipperrary's is our usual hangout spot after dodgeball on Weds night. Yes, I said it. Dodgeball.

Lots of seating in the pub. Over 25 flavours to choose from for wings. But they aren't that great to be honest. Melrose still takes the win in terms of awesome wings for Weds.  

On to the beer... the selection is all right. 

But as the cliche goes, \"It's not bad... but it's not great.\""}
{"text":"I've been here three times on Thursday happy hour, so I'm just judging for that time and the dish we always share when there.  On Thursday it is two bucks for a plate of buffalo Parmesan ribs... They are excellent and 12 bucks normal price. Anytime I've been there I've had fast friendly service....   I'll go back...

If you're single like me..... It's not a place to stay the evening in hopes of meeting someone."}
{"text":"Meh.. is how I would describe Tipperarys. Nothing that stands out as horrible about this place, but also nothing that really makes me want to go back.

I've given this place a few tries and have never been overly impressed. The only reason I even bothered to return for a second and third time was due to the fact that I had a couple coupons for the place. 

On my lunch visit to Tipperary's today I went with the lasagna and a beer. The lasagna was ok but nothing standout about it. The garlic bread that came with it wasn't garlicy at all and was pretty unappealing, and this is coming from someone who loves garlic bread!! The service was decent and I don't really have any complaints there but again, nothing really stand out about it. 

Would I return to Tipperarys? Maybe if meeting friends there or something and to try the pizza which from reading some of the other reviews sounds like it might be the best option."}
