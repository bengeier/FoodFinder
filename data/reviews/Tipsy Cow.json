{"text":"Hummus, with pita delicious! Pepper relish sets it off.   Chicken sandy to order, can pick all the favorites! Made your way!  Chicken caesar, generous portion hot great tasting grilled chicken. Every bite melts in the mouth.  And the service behind the bar is the best you'll find! Ask for Dave he will take care of ya!  Even went back for the rest of the menu on day 2 of my business trip!  Chips and dip is a belly filler in itself, followed by the buffalo chicken salad can't go wrong.   Dave made my some of the best crown and gingers my palate has come in counter with.  Wings to go and another chicken sandy, one will be saved for lunch tomorrow. The other, won't make it till midnight!  Stop in tipsy cow great grub, clean, friendly, bartender Dave is the best will suggest great menu items!"}
{"text":"The burger was good. Then again I was hungry. The milkshake wasn't so good. The service was terrible. If you go, shoot for days that they run specials. Maybe I'd go back on a Monday for Wing Night or Wednesday for burger night. I personally like BRGR better in terms of both food and atmosphere. I went to eat... But as a bar, they do serve alcohol"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Shadyside! I love everything about this place, from the decor to the menu. Their special is the BYOB - build your own burger - which comes with endless delicious options. The menu also has a large variety of wings. The food was great, drinks were great, and the service was great. Make sure you check into their specials, wing night, sangria night, trivia night...etc as theyre well worth it!"}
{"text":"Awful. Only one server working. Chicken sandwich was incredibly bland and I struggled to down half the sandwich. Others thought the 50/50 burger was lacking flavor. Checks were given to some at our table before they received their meal. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Better than average. We were seated quickly,  drinks served quickly,  and the food was absolutely on point. I had a custom burger. It was prepared perfect and the portions weren't huge. The ambiance was chill, the decor was nice,  and the crowd was nice. The only downside was the server. She wasn't awful she just seemed distracted or something. Overall a really great experience once we got our food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great -- The patio will be a hot spot this summer and while the menu is pretty limited, the food is a good as you can expect. Will be back"}
{"text":"Ambiance: This place used to be Shadyside Saloon and was completely revamped.  There was a brief stint as \"Stack'd 2\" and \"The Avenue\", but it seems the name has now settled on \"Tipsy Cow\".  The setting is an upscale burger joint similar to BRGR or Burgatory.  Several TVs inside along the bard with plenty of seating for groups as well.  There's darts in the back.  Really nice outdoor seating area for about 25 people which is dog friendly and awesome in nice weather.  Food: They offer several predefined burger options as well as a \"build-your-own\" option similar to Stack'd.  They also offer several apps, mostly of the fried variety.  I've had a few different burger options and all have been good but none amazing.  Drinks:  I have fairly high standards as far as draft beer lists go and the options here are fairly middle of the road with mostly standard widely distributed craft and national brews.  There's a few different wines by the class and a full bar.  They have sangria by the pitcher or glass and it's half-off sangria pitchers on Thursday's bringing the price down to $7.50, making this a great option for a warm Thursday evening outside.  Furthermore drinks are half-priced during happy-hour from 5-7.  Overall: While the burgers aren't the best in town the place is still pretty cool overall.  I like that it's dog friendly, has great outdoor seating, and nice drink specials."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance last night, and sadly the best part was that they brought out water bowls for my dog.   One of the biggest disappointments was the fact that the kitchen crew would come directly outside next to the patio where guests are seated, and smoke, multiple times throughout our meal. I didn't come to a restaurant to sit in an ashtray. This was unsanitary and also probably was the reason our three burgers took 45 minutes on a not busy night.   Additionally our burgers were cooked well done when we all circled medium rare. The overcooked burger was accompanied by extremely undercooked cold fries.   Last thing - I understand there are new servers all the time, however ours mentioned she was new multiple times and that she didn't know the items we were asking for on the menu. She didn't use anything to write down our orders so after every time we ordered a new drink or food item, she would come back out to ask again what we wanted.    Tipsy Cow may only be good if you're tipsy and want less enjoyable bar food."}
{"text":"Had a Sunday afternoon to kill while my son was checking out CMU. Parked myself at the bar to watch some NFL football. I found the food, service and drinks to be great. I loved the fact you could get a can of Miller lite for 2 bucks or you could splurge and get a high quality IPA for 10 bucks.. Food was great, I had a build your own breakfast sandwich which was off the charts and later on, some buffalo wings that were top quality.."}
{"text":"It's sad I have to review this place so low and never was given the chance to even try their food. I went to Shadyside with all intentions of eating there. I saw their patio was dog friendly from their Facebook page so we had our boxer mix with us. The outside was a bit crowded but there was a two top table not being used. After waiting for about 5 minutes and almost having another group butt in front of us, the hostess came over. We ask for a table for two outside since we had the dog and she just stared at us. There was clearly a table available, but eventually she found her words and told us it would be a 40 minute wait and just walk away to the group waiting for a table behind us. No can I take your name, would you like to wait, nothing. It was the rudest thing ever for her to just pass over us.  I will never go back to this establishment after being treated so poorly that we weren't even allowed in the door."}
{"text":"Great place! The burgers are delicious, the patio is really nice, and half price happy hour is awesome. They have a decent mix of draft beers and some really good house cocktails. Plus Thursday is sangria night!"}
{"text":"I tried this place with a friend after the Pup Walk in Shadyside. They were so fantastic about accommodating us and allowing us to sit on the patio with my pup. I'm not sure if they're regularly dog-friendly, or if this was a special circumstance because the Pup Walk was in the neighborhood, but soon after we were seated, three other groups with dogs in tow joined us on the patio!   Their menu is a little sparse - pretty typical salads and burgers, which were fine. The service was good and our waitress was attentive, but it was about Noon on a Saturday and a few tables, so they really weren't that busy.   I would try this place again if they continued to be dog-friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews. My guess is this place had some early challenges with identity and service but we most definitely did not have that experience. Over 1 month now since it has opened and it by far trumps it's predecessors at this location. Overall, Tipsy Cow is a good addition to Shadyside with ample outdoor seating (surprisingly hard to find in the Burgh) to celebrate the end of winter and a VERY reasonably priced drink and food menu. Great casual spot to hang out with a few friends.   Ambience: I didn't go inside so I can't comment much on the interior. They did a great job capitalizing on the front space though- at least 10 tables to seat 4-6 people. Plus the front wall retracts to open the whole restaurant to the outdoor air. Definitely need more of this in Pittsburgh when the weather is nice.   Food: Fried mac n cheese = epitome of Pittsburgh. Sooo good and heart attack inducing. The fried pickles and French fries I thought were pretty standard. They also have a build-a-burger concept for $10-15 or so. The wings were average. Good bar food but nothing to write home about except the fried mac n cheese. I'll go back just for that.   Drinks: The beer list was disappointing- a reasonable mix of types but they didn't have many craft or local beers. Aside from that, cocktails were rather reasonably priced. And on Thursdays, 1/2 off sangria pitchers with some of the best sangria I've had in the city for $7 per pitcher.  Service: This was where I disagreed with other reviews. Maybe we went on a good day or after they fixed their problems from opening. The service was prompt and helpful. Plus they brought out a beer pitcher for my friend's dog to drink out of and a box for him to eat his food. I haven't seen many dog friendly establishments in Pittsburgh..."}
{"text":"Last Thursday I went to the tipsy cow with a friends for happy hour drinks. My first drink was a Strawberry margarita, and it was delicious! I then tried the blackberry mule special they had that night, and that was unique and delicious as well. I ordered carnitas tacos off the appetizer menu and when they arrived, to my dismay, they were mahi mahi tacos! i would have probably loved them had i not been allergic to fish, so i had to politely send them back. i could not be happier with the response of the staff. the manager was extremely apologetic and said that my next drink of my choice was on the house. while i don't easily get disappointed by wrong orders, i was extremely impressed by the reaction of the staff. i highly recommend. while i doubt the tipsy cow staff makes mistakes often, they surely redeem themselves on the rare occasion that they do. and the carnitas tacos were bomb!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this weekend. It was a cool atmosphere and on a warm summer night it was great to sit outside. My friends and I got a pitcher of sangria and some light food. The red sangria was pretty good but I did question if there was much alcohol in it. I found the food to be okay but the service was prompt on taking orders and checking back on us. Overall the place was pretty busy but not shoulder to shoulder crowded. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Ellsworth and lots of outdoor seating. They have a great happy hour special from 5-7 which is half off almost all drinks. I tried the red Sangria which came in a huge glass and was delicious! The white also looked very tasty. They had many draft beer selections including Rivertown and Summer Shandy. They are known for their build your own burgers and you can pick your meat and toppings with many different choices all coming with a side of fries. My date was happy with his burger and all the options. I went with a appetizer of the pretzel twist which came with a cheese and mustard sauce. Very tasty and worth the $5. For a busy Friday at happy hour our waitress did a nice job."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sangria was so yummy and worth for the happy hour half off price. There was so much chicken and it was the perfect amount of Cajun powder. The pieces were very big though and would have preferred if they were cut up and then fried. Loved the vibe of the place but service was a tad slow even when we first arrived and there weren't a lot of people there yet. 10/10 will come back again. My friend got a burger and it looked like what they have at stackd but it's $3 more expensive here :( he said it was very good though! Tipsy cow also offers a lot of different burger options (lamb, bacon, sausage, turkey, veggie, etc)."}
{"text":"I love how you can customize and create incredible burgers. Your mind and creativity is the only limit on your dinner. I will upload a picture. The staff is super friendly and there are dart boards with an open tournament on Monday Nights, no skill required! 5 Stars!!! Also a great revolving Craft Beer list.  The Secret Tipsy Cow Menu. 1.Beef MR 2. Habanero Rub 3. Wheat Wrap 4. Sharp Shredded Cheddar 5. Jalapenos, Guacamole, Red Onions. 6. Request Sour Cream and Pico. This equals one awesome meal. Also beef can be substituted for Grilled Chicken, Carnetas or BBQ Brisket (Barbacoa) Best Burritto in Pittsburgh thanks Will the Chef, it was awesome!  #SecretMenu"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Tipsy Cow partly on a whim and partly because of the amazing name.  Once we got there we were quickly seated inside.  It was rather loud due to the live band (i.e. three dudes playing instruments and singing popular songs, it was pretty good), and so not really an ideal place to have an intimate conversation.  We often found each other pseudo yelling to hear each other.    I tried to order Sangria... despite there being a usual special on thursday nights (the night we went) ...well apparently they arent doing sangria because they are doing like a wine series.  Oh well, I got a strawberry basil margarita which was strong and had a rather artificial strawberry taste.  That being said, I really enjoyed the customizable burgers.  I ordered a bunless burger with classic rub and various toppings like tomato, romaine, onion, cucumber, and avocado.  The waitress said the classic rub would be ok but didnt really know much else haha.  Anyway, the point is I had no reaction and it was definitely gluten free :D   So it was a nice night out with live music, pretty good food, and an ok drink.   I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Nice new place on Ellsworth.  I just went there with some friends for brunch this weekend.  The food was pretty good (we only got a couple of appetizers), but damn: $10 for a beer on draft?  I miss the days when places in Shadyside were more affordable.  I probably won't be back unless friends drag me back again."}
{"text":"I've gone here for drinks, and while everything was good, I wasn't 'wowed'. I ordered the wings off the menu and they were alright. I'm not sure if this is always the case, but the atmosphere was very loud but fun at the same time. I'll definitely return to try something different off the menu!"}
{"text":"tipsy cow is such a good vibe for a weekday night. with the outdoor patio and open concept of a bar / restaurant, it really makes you feel like you're in a welcoming place. the food was awesome but the service was a little slow. in all respect, there were maybe 2 waitresses and they did amazing for the amount of people they had to serve. everyone was friendly and always addressed our needs. the live music was a great addition to our meal! definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We had our company happy hour here and they were so accommodating!  Great drinks, great food, and they even turned up the music for us when we asked!   A huge shout out to Dave and Anna for getting us all set up and taken care of!   We are excited to come back soon!"}
{"text":"If I had to sum this place in 3 words: Maggie is awesome. Not to discredit the others since I've only been here once, but Maggie was on top of her shit. I also didn't get food, but her service and their happy hour were fantastic."}
{"text":"Service was not great. Both the waitress and hostess were texting on their phones the whole time. After getting food, we were not checked on and it took 15 minutes for us to get our check. The waitress finally refilled our waters when she brought our check. Despite the service, the food was good."}
{"text":"Although tipsy cow is a place I frequent, I will make a full disclaimer that it's strictly for atmosphere & drinks and not for food & service.   Happy hour is my favorite time to stop by, because who doesn't love 1/2 off pitchers of sangria and cheap beer?! In the warmer months, they offer an awesome patio that puts you right in the heart of all the bustle on Ellsworth.   I have been here more times than I can count and I am never overwhelmed by anything on the menu. It's average American fare, but it makes a good snack when you're drinking. Service is also typically slow.   For sure a place to come when you're looking for good drinks and a relaxed vibe!"}
{"text":"Tipsy Cow is by far the best neighborhood bar and grill in Shadyside. The wings are consistently good and have tons of flavors. The burgers allow you to customize what you want and are delicious. They've improved the layout of the place so it's a sports bar but it's not overwhelmingly that vibe. There's something for everyone. Most importantly, Dave the manager runs a great staff that will get to know you and make you feel like Norm on Cheers, if you're so inclined as I am to hang around for a while."}
{"text":"The waitress made me feel as if I were bothering her while she sat at the end of the bar eating her food with the hostess and other staff... I wanted to eat and have fun too.I had to ask for a menu she never offered...smh"}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. I ordered chicken fingers and the first one I bit into was raw. Not undercooked. Completely raw. It was cold and rubbery. They were, of course, very apologetic. They didn't comp our visit, offering fries for free instead. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday evening around dinner time and expected great things - I'm a big fan of Stack'd in Shadyside also and their burgers are yum!  First of all our service was terrible. I hate to say that because the waitress was very nice and friendly but I think the place was just highly understaffed with way too many customers and not enough waiters/waitresses to handle them. It was over a half hour between the time I sat down and the time I actually was able to even order anything (maybe a 15 minute wait just for my glass of water).  I ordered wings to share, half Thai Chili and half OMFG! sauce (both of which I've had at Stack'd) and though I am aware that they are labeled spicy - usually my friend and I can handle spicy. However these were WAYY too spicy to the point where you could tell the flavor was good but the fire was just a bit much.  They also lost my other friend's burger order and had to rush it later after the rest of our food had already been brought out even though he turned in his order slip along with us.  Then when we were almost finished eating and ready to go, the waitress came out with 2 more wings saying the kitchen had dropped them (on the floor?) and decided to make us new ones give them to us like 20+ minutes later? We hadn't noticed because the menu doesn't say how many you are actually supposed to get but I thought this was strange - though it was nice of them to give us the wings even though we didn't ask for them.   I don't want to be too harsh and ideally I would leave around 2.5 stars but since the wings were good (albeit too hot to handle) I'll round up to 3. But the establishment needs to pick up the pace a bit because the service was far too slow and I spent a good chunk of my time here feeling frustrated."}
{"text":"I liked the Tipsy Cow.  I went on a Tuesday night specifically to participate in Bar Trivia and I genuinely enjoyed myself.  We were sitting right next to the door too and were concerned cold air would blow through but I was warm so that was a plus!  Bar Trivia was fun, food was pretty similar to Stack'd.  Atmosphere was fun and I would definitely go back for a hang out."}
{"text":"Maybe I am aging out of some of the Shadyside establishments or maybe I just am not a burger person, but I am not sure about the Tipsy Cow.  We have a bunch of places just like this  in the city and also more burger joints are opening.  Tipsy Cow has the choose your own menu with very limited chef combos.  There are some interesting apps fried mac and cheese bites and, my forever app, the fried pickle.  They are slices, not spears, but the spicy ranch is mouth burning.  Keep in mind that Tipsy Cow means spicy when they say spicy.  I like a little spicy, but nothing that takes away from my meal and I need to counter act it with something else.    Highlight of my visit: Happy Hour is great.  1/2 price drinks.  Pretty good deal."}
{"text":"This place has a serious identity crisis. Tipsy Cow is the newest rebrand for this location, which was redone last year around this time. First informally known as 'Stack'd 2' after Stackd in Shadyside it was finally given the official name of 'The Ave' in the Fall. I found they had rebranded to the Tipsy Cow when I arrived back from Hong Kong at the beginning of April.  Last time I was there was Monday as the day was pleasant and my friend and I had a desire to dine outside. The tipsy cow has 4-5 tables outside and another 3 booths with opened up windows. Very good. K and I arrived to find a few of our MBA kids already sitting so we joined the party and eventually inherited the table. The corner booths comfortably fit 5 people.   Once seated, our waitress [waitron] was MIA. So it took about 10 minutes or a little more for me to finally get a good old Dogfish Head 60 minute. [How I do love this Beer] At least with company the waiting was not bad. Finally I grabbed some wings [super crispy and filling but at $10 for 12 that's a bit pricey for Pittsburgh] and K some fries [standard]. After taking over the table we lounged until it started raining and hunted down the MIA waitron so we could leave.  Pros: Good draft beer selection, wings, Build you own Burger menu, outdoor seating Cons: MIA waitron  Good staple for Ellsworth but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I know this is a new establishment and they're still working kinks out... but I had a very bad experience at Tipsy Cow. I went on a Monday night for dinner.  It's seat yourself, but there was no way to know it until one of the servers walking by told us to seat ourselves. The other group waiting who came after us then took the table we would've wanted so we lucked out there.  It took a while for our server to find us and bring us menus, one of which was a beer menu written on a piece of receipt paper... While we were waiting to place our order, we saw a group of people leave without ordering and left their menus on their table - bad sign. There were only 2 servers working there that night, so I understand why we didn't see our server much. But the lack of service we received when she came by and her unfriendliness was very discouraging. We ordered burgers, which arrived way over cooked. We asked for refills of water but never got them. Our server would visit the table next to us but would ignore us, and not once did she even ask how things were. We eventually had to go up to the bar to get waters. Oh but when we went up to the bar, the bartender had disappeared for a few minutes too. At last, we saw our waitress who already had our check and silently left it on the table. We noticed that she at least had the time to write \"thank you\" on the check. She again visited the table next to us but conveniently didn't notice our check was ready to be picked up so I had to get up and follow her to hand it to her.  I was definitely not impressed by the venue or the food. The service could have made up for it, but unfortunately it was severely lacking."}
{"text":"We brought my daughter here because we were starving. The staff was awesome one in particular made sure our food came out right away cause she knew my daughter was hungry. They also gave her things to occupy her.  Food was great but most importantly me and my family were well taken care of. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Only had drinks, but got to try three different kinds of cocktails and a beer. My favorite was the Seasonal Moscow Mule. It had spiced apple cider, vodka, lime juice, and ginger beer -- the perfect combination! The food looked good, so I plan to go back. My only complaint would be that I felt a bit rushed. I wasn't finished with my drink yet, but the server came by and asked if we wanted the check. She was nice enough though to give all four of us our own receipt, since we were paying separately, which was appreciated."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich = amazing. And $3 Bloody Mary with it...can't beat that!!! It was my first time here and was surprised to see they have a build your own breakfast sandwich slip of paper (for hamburgers too). I had the sausage and egg, cheddar, tomato and the house sauce. Added a hash brown on the side for $1. Whole meal was under $10 and so yummy. Love that they have outdoor seating as well and different drink specials!"}
{"text":"Chill vibe to this place. It was not busy when we went on a Friday night. The outside area is a nice place to sit when weather permits. However it does close at 1:30 AM where is the inside stays open until 2 AM. Standard drinks and pricing"}
{"text":"This place must be pre-qualified for the \"Restaurant Impossible\" show: I got food poisoning today from our lunch there. From the quick glance I had from the kitchen I should not be surprised. The service was also completely understaffed and very slow."}
{"text":"Great burgers! And great service! The checklist menu helps you build the perfect burger. Go for the garlic aioli. You will enjoy your burger here."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating, and all the times I've gone out to eat here the food never disappoints me. From burgers, to fried pickles, wings, and even the salads the food tastes extraordinary.   Their cocktails are delicious too, but a bit pricy, so I usually only enjoy one and then get a classic mixed drink. The crowd that goes is usually 20s-30s I would say, at least for lunches and weekend drinking, so their music played reflects on that and is usually whatever the top songs on the radio are. Touchtunes is also there though so if there's something special you DO want to hear, you're more than welcome to switch it up!   Depending when you go the restaurant could be packed and very loud, or it can be pretty empty with only a few tables taken. I don't have a preference as the service doesn't seem to be affected either way. Keep it up tipsy cow, you have a loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Tipsy Cow for the penguin game since that was the only bar that had a couple tables open where you can see the tv. I really enjoyed my experience! Our server Jen was very nice and very attentive! My boyfriend had some wings, the sauces were really good and flavorful. I had a jerky cow, one of their specialty burgers. I ordered it MR and to my surprise it actually came out MR! I know it sounds like it should be a given, but I can't remember when was the last time I had a burger in a sports bar that was cooked to the right temp! Great job! That being said, the burger was missing that spicy kick from jerk seasoning I expected... Good flavor all in all! Our friends enjoyed their food as well! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a great find right outside of Bloomfield and shadyside! This is a great bar with great m food! We ordered wings, chicken fingers, and fries and made a meal out of those! The proportions were great and the food was great! We didn't have any drinks, but they looked great! Our waitress was great and the atmosphere was cool and hip! I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"After working a night shift I came here after eating nothing all day and ordered the hummus and a side of fries and just came down with food poisoning. I highly question the cleanliness and quality of this food."}
{"text":"I've visited this sister restaurant to Stack'd maybe 2-3 times now. I have to say, while the service is a bit better, it's exactly the same menu at 1.5x the price. Went here with my brother and they literally put whole habanero peppers on his burger - you can't cut them up? In case you didn't realize, the smaller the pepper, the more dangerous it gets. Mine was basically a small chicken sandwich with marinara and provolone that ended up being $10.70 plus tip."}
{"text":"After feeling unsatiated from my prior dinner, I decided to stop by for an 1120PM late-night snack. My friend and I both built our own burgers, and despite the fairly well-done (I appreciate the crispy, charred outside that added additional texture and flavor) patty, I was pleasantly surprised that I was satiated enough to go into hibernation for the remaining night.  Things I liked: -friendly, welcoming staff -delicious french fries. They had skins left on, which contributes a crispier outside and soaks up the oily, salty goodness to add additional flavor -great options to build a burger  Things I didnt like: -the environment is really loud, at least on the late-night Friday we went. We exchanged our culinary experience that through sophisticated banter that comprised of yelling or ignoring each other. Perhaps it was the college basketball craze of the season... -I appreciate the option to select whether I want my patty 'pink' or 'no pink' although I doubt either really makes much of a difference. An alternative would be to go well-done and charred, respectively.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and for the price was happy for the late-night dining experience!"}
{"text":"Went to check this place out last night (Friday). I was not impressed.  Pros:  Cool atmosphere but a little loud Fun menu with the build your own burger concept Hostess will seat you at a table even if your whole party isn't there Quality of food is on the same level as the price  They have a good variety of Beers on tap and in bottles and a good selection of house cocktails.   Cons: So I did a build your own burger. Ordered numerous sauces and wrote by each one \"on the side\"..... guess what the burger came out with all the sauces on it. The waitress said the kitchen must have forgot and left the burger and went to go get the sauces on the side. About 8 minutes later she brought back the sauces... really?! The burger and bun was soaked in all sorts of sauces. Gross!! I even told her but she didn't seem to care.  Moral of the story. I might come back for drinks and apps but the build your own burger concept is not what that kitchen or server is cut out to do!!"}
{"text":"Worst burger I've had in awhile. Sad that it is a burger place. Ordered Medium, and it couldn't have been more Well. Frozen fries, not even hand cut.  Don't waste your money. If you like burgers actually cooked to temperature, avoid this place. There are about 10 other burger joints I can think of that are cheaper and better."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night with the BF and honestly was not expecting good things. I have talked to a couple of people who had bad experiences, so safe to say I was skeptical, but we rather enjoyed ourselves!  They have a small menu with a few \"house\" made burgers/sandwiches, salads, apps, or a build your own burger menu, very much like another popular burger joint some might be familiar with (*hint hint* rhymes with Purgatory), and milkshakes. Both the BF and I 'built our own' burgers- him the 50/50 with a salad and I ordered the beef with fries. I liked mine; it was cooked properly and tasty. We both enjoyed the 50/50 burger; I was surprised how much you could taste the bacon-y flavor, although I felt it was a little dry and he said it was not, it was juicy, so you will have to form your own opinion there... We also tried a salty caramel milkshake for the walk home and it was good.  I know the other reviews complain about the service, and like I said, I have heard that from people I know, but our service was fine. Our waitress was attentive enough; filled waters, asked how things were, checked in...things of that nature.   For me, I enjoyed this place. I would have probably only given it 3.5 stars if I was able, but Yelp has yet to make that change (*hint hint* Yelp). It wasn't my favorite but I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've never been a mainstream brunch guy. The hype, the prices, the opportunity cost, it always seems to contradict what I look for in a good time. With that being said, Tipsy Cow is the spot for me. Sunday mornings are rarely too busy to enjoy and you can usually scheme that VIP treatment with a few clever words to the waiting staff.   The breakfast food is head and shoulders above the rest of the menu in every way imaginable. If you stray too far from the sausage egg and cheese don't say i didn't warn you. The sausage BANGS and without it this would be a 3 Star review. Its very unfortunate that this mornings visit was defined by a klutzy waitress. I understand there are several moving parts for a server to handle but we needed a little more dedication from our sister.   The nachos might be the worst in the city. Fake cheese, pre cooked chicken (i understand this is the standard), sub par sour cream, it was gut wrenching.   On a positive note, this place has the best Bloody Mary's in the city. Whatever BM mix they use is something serious and for 3 buck you ain't gonna find much better.   French fries are fire. Sausage smacks. Clean dining room. Just make sure you get one of the short italian beauty's to take care of you.  XFactor: PRICE. 10 bucks for a sausage egg & cheese, fresh cooked fries, and a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I like the place for summer since they have an open front and it gets pretty busy. The burger was good too."}
{"text":"This place is a decent little burger joint with outside seating, a cool interior atmosphere, good food and drinks. Their milkshakes are also spot on, tasting like a classic shake and served in a classic milkshake glass. While the food is very good, the place is a little pricey for a burger restaurant, no sides are included with main dishes, and the menu is scattered with hidden gems rather than popping out at you. Overall, it's a good spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  Had a build your own burger.  Was able to build a burger that was very tasty and cooked perfectly.  Actually the burger was better than expected but not as good as a few other burger joints."}
{"text":"Britney is the best waitress ever - come here and ask for her to serve you. She is amazing."}
{"text":"You can order a burger, wings, etc. off the menu or you can build your own burger, which is what I did. The concept and options are not too different from Burgatory. Taste-wise, however, Burgatory is way better. The burger I created had avocado, baby spinach, pesto aioli, provolone, cucumbers, and mayo. I thought I would enjoy it but I was wrong. It was already disappointing that the rarest you can go is medium rare because I always eat my burgers rare. However, when I bit into my burger, I was even more disappointed to find that my \"medium rare\" burger was actually medium. The white sangria I ordered was really average. I wouldn't order it again. I must say though that the burgers are very fairly priced. $9 each including fries with several $1 add-in options (ex: egg, avocado, guacamole, bacon, onion straws, fried mac & cheese). Their happy hour prices are also good. Came in a group of 4 on a Monday at 5pm and the place was very empty.   Taste | 2.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3"}
{"text":"Updating my review to 4 stars because I am pretty blown away by their awesome happy hour. A friend and I had 4 beers for less than $9 at happy hour tonight. Everything is half off - you can't beat it! Other bars in the area will have half off certain items, but here it's everything besides their specialty cocktails. Still can't speak much to their food as I've only had apps - but if you're looking for happy hour in Shadyside, this is your spot. Also have great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. I'm always impressed by the service at the bar (I have always sat at the bar). Friendly and highly attentive. The food is great with highly reasonable prices. It's your typical bar food but well. Would highly recommend to others and plan on continuing to regularly patronize."}
{"text":"I felt like the Tipsy Cow had a ton of potential: a build-your-own burger menu, decent location, and great atmosphere.   Unfortunately, the food just didn't live up to my expectations. The burgers we're ok, but nothing to write home about. I really enjoyed their unique fries which had a house seasoning, but I don't think they'll be for everyone. I had a chocolate milkshake too which was sadly very poorly-mixed with very hefty chunks of chocolate throughout.  Nothing bad to say about the service. Our server was very friendly and happy to field a request for recommendations. The food arrived promptly despite it being a busy Friday night.  If you're nearby and want a burger, the tipsy cow might be worth stopping by to give a try. I wasn't crazy about the food though and probably won't be making a special trip again."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were okay - their menu is BYOB - build your own burger. The burgers are actually quite big, the meat patty was tasty and overall worth the money. I was a bit disappointed by the Buffalo Chicken Wings as it was drowned in a sauce that could be barely described as Buffalo.   Typical (dive-ish) sports bar - good for groups for Happy Hour. If you eat here, go with the burger.  PS: Our table won the trivia game that night and was rewarded with a $25 gift card. They didn't want to let us use it though on the same night. Awkward."}
{"text":"The food was great. You get to design your own burger (bad note: the salmon burger was on the menu but no longer available). I selected the veggie burger after hearing the sad news about the discontinued salmon burger. You get to pick from a variety of sauces. The Thai sauce was really good yet very spicy. Also, the Bloody Mary and Russian drink were quite tasty."}
{"text":"I mean it's ok here-kind of a bro like crowd. Never had food and only a couple of beers. Probably not a place I'll frequent, not my type of crowd. Liked it better when it was Shadyside Saloon."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends the other night. The seating was first come first served and not well regulated.   Our waitress was prompt, but it seemed as though the kitchen and the bar were definitely running slow.   We ordered two appetizers that oddly came with the exact same dipping sauce. The fried pickles were definitely better than the fried mac and cheese bites.   The burgers came next after quite a wait and my friends Sangria took a while as well. Once the burgers came mine was missing most of the toppings and needed to be sent back. My friends milkshake was also MIA.   When my burger was back in the kitchen the waitress explained that they just forgot a few of the toppings and were adding them to the burger. As such when my burger was returned to me it was severely dried out, though I will say it was worth returning just to get the cheese wheel topping that was delicious.   When my friends milkshake did appear it was also dropped off without a straw. Overall the service was spotty and the food was just ok. I might go back, but with so many different burger places in Pittsburgh I am not sure I will."}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight with a bunch of friends for trivia night and I was honestly really disappointed with the food! There weren't any tables available for our group for trivia night (which is no one's fault) so the five of us had to situate ourselves at the bar. There were no drink specials or food specials either, which is also kind of disappointing because the food is pretty overpriced in my opinion. I ordered a BYO-burger and the patty was tiny. Alcohol is always expensive anywhere so that's why it's nice to just grab the special since it's cheap, but there weren't any, so we just split a pitcher.   The service was okay and not very attentive (also slightly rude when my friend asked questions about what was on tap) but the atmosphere of the other diners was nice and bustling. Trivia was really fun and the trivia host was super super great. But that was it. If it were not for the trivia that night and my friends wanting to go, I definitely would not come here for the food."}
