{"text":"This place is very good!  The enchilada style chicken burrito was delish...best rice and beans ever!  My daughter, being staunch vegetarian, had the Mexican bowl without meat.  I'm looking forward to ordering again and trying other items :-)  The only downside was it took forever to get the delivery but the owner personally delivered and was very nice, I understand totally what it's like to be extremely busy which should reflect highly on his restaurant.  Ok, I ordered again tonight and again very pleased.  Carnitas very tender, wings bomb!  Must say again how awesome the rice and beans are.  Thumbs up to Grubhub.  I will be ordering again very soon!"}
{"text":"OMG... Me and my friends came in here by accident and boy I'm glad we did... The food and the service was Amazing, The chicken was delicious tender and moist, I'm definitely coming back every time I'm in Vegas!  ."}

{"text":"this place is located inside of a little market. I stopped by based on the recommendation of yelp and it was a great place with great food. highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I called late for a delivery from Sacramento, CA to my boyfriend in Las Vegas because he was craving Mexican food. I called a couple of other places but they weren't  too friendly and did not want to do anymore delivery. So I called Senor Pollo Restaurant and Rami took my order even though it was almost closing time. He was really nice and made it happen for me...the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I ever had in Las Vegas, he even added a little extra to my order for free. My boyfriend said the food was delicious and freshly made. I will definitely come by and thank him personally when I move to Vegas next week."}
{"text":"La comida muy deliciosa ! El pollo es el mas rico de Las vegas. Una atencion excelente y los precios razonables! Cuando visite Las Vegas seguro vuelvo por ahi!"}
{"text":"I loved the food here. A group of friends and I came here for dinner. I had chicken, that was perfectly seasoned it was wonderful to eat a piece of meat that didn't need additional seasoning or sauce. That is so rare these days. I didn't have a chance to eat any Mexican food but their case looked good. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"We ordered the Carnitas Family Combo \"Enough to feed 5\" they need to add  \"Plus Some\"-Fresh & Hot with all the sides. The Shrimp Ceviche was excellent! And the Husband is still noshing on the chicken wings ( he is very picky when it comes to his wings) the sample of the potato salad was great....will be ordering that next time!! Delivery was fast with great customer service, he made sure we had everything we ordered plus pointed out a few extras!! Very Satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome prices. The chicken was amazing service was awesome. Must go! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Friendly people  great service!!!  I am from  Los Angeles and I would definitely come back here every time I come Las Vegas.  The chicken are tasty and Juicy.  And the place is super clean.  And the price is also great!"}
{"text":"Great food and strong flavors. Grilled chicken was very tender and cooked to perfection. Great service and friendly people. Delivery is fast and food arrives hot. Try the rice pudding, very yummy. Thanks guys for the great food ;)"}
{"text":"I placed an order this morning for a delivery. After an hour, I checked on the status of my order, and was told that it was out for delivery with the driver. An hour later, I received an email, saying that my cancellation request was processed, and I will be refunded in 2-3 business days? I was then told that the restaurant has no drivers for the day, and therefore is not making any deliveries.   Extremely frustrated, and will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really good food and awesome delivery!!  Even as a picky eater, I love the food. They allow you to create a burrito with many different options. Also, the quesadilla is perfect. Definitely a good choice for anyone to try.  Great authentic taste.  Ordering now as we speak!"}
{"text":"Food came quickly and was delicious. Those working there were very helpful and knowledgeable in the areas I had questions. Price is definitely worth the food. I reccomend trying this place if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I have visited the resturaunt often. The staff is so friendly, place is always clean and food is so amazing and is served fast too!!! . Recently I have been having my food delivered from senor pollo and I am completely blown away by the service I receive. They are always so prompt, the driver is so friendly and the food comes hot!.  When there is a problem. Rami (the owner) always finds a way to make it right and have me walking away a happy customer! Keep up the great work guys!  I am truly a customer for life! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken, rice, beans, tortillas. Good, fast customer service, clean facility and friendly staff. Definitely will eat at Senor Pollo again on my next visit to Vegas. Thank you for your good tasting food!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! My second time around and again i left very happy. Its one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. It is very difficult to find an authentic Mexican place. I am amazed in how tasty their food is. Many choices , tasty food, and great prices. I am glad i made the choice to come visit again."}
{"text":"I absolutely recommend either eating at the restaurant or having it delivered. The customer service is beyond excellent. I tried the mojarra frita and a shrimp burrito  and both were exquisite dishes. The delivery is very prompt and the driver has excellent customer service. I will order here everyday from now on. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"I literally ordered my food for 5 minutes ago I arrive there about 7 minutes ago I was treated very kindly I even interacted with some of the customers that were currently eating their dinner and they were a delightful experience to say the least. I then went to the cashier and ask is my order ready he gratefully treated me and said yes your order is ready and I will also include a side of large hips I then said thank you sir this looks very delightful. I then went home and indulged in the Mexican food and it was amazing Simply Amazing I had the carne asada fries with fried tortilla chips and a 6 ounce of Red Sox and it was amazing I would recommend this to anybody or anyone that has the munchies or the audacity to order Mexican food thank you and goodnight"}
{"text":"Honestly the best menudo ive been able to find in vegas comes from this resturaunt, ive personally dwnlded their app added as a favorite. Great food perfectly proportioned delivered hot an fresh. Thank you Rami."}
{"text":"I ordered $58.58 dollars worth food on Monday, April 18, through Eat24.  After over 2 hours I called restaurant.  They claimed driver didn't show but they would get it out with another driver.  Another 2 hours and no food so I called again and talked to Rami.  He said they got too busy.  I told him to just go ahead and refund my money and cancel my order.  He told me he'd discount the order but by this time it was 930 pm.  He then said food was on way and to just take food and he'd refund my money.  Needless to say I received no food and my card was charged the $58.58.  I tried calling but both times I've been told he isn't there."}
{"text":"Horrible food, had their chicken and it was still raw in the middle. They're delivery time was Horrible as well,was told 30 mins took them an hour and a half on a Tuesday night. Would not even recommended it to a starving kid from a foreign country if they were giving the food away. Only giving 1 star because hello yelp wouldn't let me give 0"}
{"text":"This place was great. We ordered delivery last night, and then came over for dinner tonight. First off, best horchata in town (and we've sampled a ton!). The food was great: delicious and full of flavor. We got a burrito enchilada style which was giant and delicious. Also got the taco salad which was spicy and flavor packed. Their pico is spicy and fresh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is AUTHENTIC and very tasty. The customer service is top notch. I will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas!!! The burritos are amazing. The customer service is great, every time  i'm in Vegas with the boys I make sure I stop by there."}

{"text":"I hadn't even seen the owners comment until now. I had no clue it was an issue with Eat24.  Nice friendly guy :)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place forever so we decided to go and get the wings and fries special.  First as we were trying to get to the place we almost missed it because it's not in an actual fast food place but inside of a liquor store.  The left side is where you get the food and the other side is the liquor store.  Perfect idea to me cause we ended up picking up a bottle of wine to go with our meal.  The place looks pretty clean although it's not in the best neighborhood but usually these kinds of place have the best food.  There isn't much seating about 2 or 3 tables and there is no privacy from the customers entering the liquor store.  If there was more privacy we may have eaten our food there. Service was ok considering the lady that took our order didn't speak much english but enough to understand our order.  Then there was the lady that we paid for out food and she was really friendly and helpful.  Service alone will bring me back to a business.  We got our fries and we had to wait a bit because they made them to order and they weren't sitting out waiting to get sauce added to them.  I'm a French fry connoisseur so they weren't as good as I would like them too and they weren't crispy but they were made fresh.  My boyfriend to the mild wings and I got the hot wings.  The wings are HUGE and not the skimpy ones like Wing Stop and I mean HUGE and meaty.  Since I like spicy food my wings weren't too spicy to me but they were pretty good.  I tried my boyfriend's mild wings and they were pretty good too.    I looked at the Mexican food they had there and it didn't look so great because it looked like it had been sitting all day and had that film around it.  I have seen the pictures of their food so maybe I will go another time to try their tacos and burritos since mexican food is my favorite on the planet.  So I definitely will be back and I say give them a try."}
{"text":"I'm not nearly done eating yet but I want to write this before I forget.  I've been looking for good Mexican delivery for ages and finally found it here. Everything we ordered is great. My Cuban raised mother-in-law says the beef-potato balls are the best she's had. Her husband is raving about the enchilada style chicken burrito. Everyone else's mouths are too full to comment.  The delivery was a little late, but it was a large order, so no big deal. Our driver was amazing (I wish I'd caught his name). Seriously awesome, friendly and helpful. Overall very cool.  Everything is hot and fresh. The vegetables are crisp and the fruit is juicy. The meat is perfectly cooked and the tortillas are tender. I grew up in Southern California, but can't remember the last time I had better Mexican food.  I'd write an essay about how impressed I am if I weren't in such a hurry to get back to my food. I'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in the chicken I had. Maybe I was expecting something more asado than anything. The chicken tasted like the whole chickens they sell at Albertsons for like 5$.For what I paid I wasn't happy. The only thing I did enjoy was that the service was ok from the workers. I did enjoy the pepino with limon drink though. That's about it. I won't be returning though."}
{"text":"Just checked in to this place waiting for my food. Was a little hard to find. It's inside Maria's Market (I think that's the name). Got 2 orders of the wings and fries. Their website said it comes with 12 but the sign says 10 my order came with 9. Some of their prices differ from their site but are still cheap. I checked in using yelp and received a discount. They only offer ranch with the wings no blu cheese. Wings were okay sauce was good smelt different from other places and it came with seasoned fries. Paid $13.50."}
{"text":"Awesome, I repeat, AWESOME service! I don't know how the food was (it looks delicious from the photos) because I'm in LA and I ordered food for my shop crew in Las Vegas and Rami is beyond helpful!  We will definitely order from Señor Pollo again anytime we're treating our guys to lunch and I will make it a point to stop in and taste the food for myself next time I'm in Vegas!  Thank you very much for your great service!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for authentic food like this for months in Vegas. Located inside the marketplace. This place has everything including what everyone forgets , great hospitality. The folks that work here treat you like family. Notice I haven't even started talking about the food yet. I ordered takeout late Friday. I called first but they didn't pick up later found out is because their busy. The owner called me back, first time ever a restaurant called me back lol. I ordered steak enchilada, carne asada fries and chicken wings. They told me exactly when to expect my order pick up and called back with update... I know crazy right. Upon arriving I noticed the place had way more to offer than what you can see on yelp. The owner gave me samples of other dishes on display that had me drooling. They have an app that you can download which is best way to order with pics. Hands down great place for authentic Mexican food, will order again so I can try everything. Not a sit down to eat place. Primarily takeout/pickup and delivery."}
{"text":"This place was delicious but delivery took FOREVER. The driver did call to tell me he was going to be ten minutes late but he ended up being an hour late. Frustrating. Would have been much more tolerable if he'd just been honest to begin with. When he finally showed up (2 hours after we placed the order) he said he'd had to do a delivery downtown and gave us a card for 10% off next time. Seriously?  10%?  That's why restaurants have a \"delivery area\". Why are they delivering to downtown from North Vegas?  They need to either hire more drivers or limit their delivery area. Such a shame because the food really was tasty."}
{"text":"Great food amazing service they have the best tortas in town. They always have fresh pork (carnitas) . Don't be fooled by its location food is just amazing and affordable."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food. The pastor and carnitas tacos are delicious! I ordered delivery and was charged a fee for every little side so that was the only down side that made it seem pricier than other places, but it was excellent food and I would order again. Also had a burrito enchilada style which was good and a large portion. Pozole soup really good, lots of flavor. Cucumber lime drink was sweet and refreshing.  To be fair the two salsas we ordered were much more than we needed. Also, we were given some ceviche for free which was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Always I get delivery it takes about an hour or hour and a half but it's worth the wait the food is top notch very high quality food. Wings are bomb and the hamburgers too very good prices. Now Mexican authentic food they have the best ever. Would recommend this place to everyone. People works here are very professional and always smiling and they give you samples as much as you want to try everything they have...."}
{"text":"I waited 4 hours for my food. Even though the restraunt said our food had left twice. I had actually cancelled tge order through delivery.com, and a few minutes later the driver came. He promised the food was fresh, it wasn't. But the service! So bad. I ordered food at 6 and it didn't come till 10 at night!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected all bad if you want good chicken wings go to Boston pizza"}
{"text":"I was exited to try this place. But I was disappointed with the delivery. The burrito was not rolled correctly and the tortilla was oily and soggy. I even considered toasting it in my toaster oven to crisp it up but it did not appetizer me anymore. Unfortunately I won't be ordering from here any time soon."}
{"text":"I finally came to señor pollo after being invited by the owner a numerous amount of time, he promised me the best menudo ever, he is Sooooooo wrong because mom's food is the best but however his comes second lol."}
{"text":"Delivery, yeah for delivery! Only ordered 2 items, fried catfish yum! And family carnitas which is 2lbs. Not sure why they shredded it all, made it REALLY dry. It was ok, but we will not be ordering it again. Big props though for the salsa and sides!  I asked for extra crispy fish and it was crispy when it got to my house! I will order again, and try different things."}
{"text":"I came to the strip and I was craving Authentic Mexican Food and I found this restaurant and it was really good. Not only the service but the food as well. I would recommended to anyone craving Mexican food while staying at Vegas"}
{"text":"We originally went in for wings which are amazing! I got a deal off Yelp pay $10 for $20 worth of food. Well we ended up getting a carne asada quesadilla, the 3 taco plate and an extra taco and our total was $19.94!!!! Great fresh food for a great price even without a coupon!!!! Great customer service and love that it's in a small market."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!It was a delivery that was on time and tasty! There's a great amount of options to choose from. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas for my buddies bachelor party, we got wasted the night before, no Bueno lol any how I yelped near by restaurants and this little Gem came up! I rarely rate restaurants but seriously everything we had was amazing!!! the chicken was moist tender and delicious, my buddy Joe had a burrito with al pastor which he said was freaking delicious! I tried a  piece and yep! he was right.. The staff was really nice and welcoming which is a plus, but I care More about the food..  Haha try this place you won't regret it:) specially if your looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"We ordered at 7:30pm on a Saturday night and our food arrived around 9:10pm. Slow delivery, but the restaurant did text me to keep me updated and let me know when the driver left for our delivery which was nice. We ordered the beef soup, which ended up being more of a stew but it was pretty good. Quesadilla was cold and bland. Ordered a shrimp ceviche that was decent and got a crab ceviche for free (not sure if that was an error or gift, but fine by me!). The fruit punch was DELICIOUS, definitely get some of that. It has fruit chunks in it and is heavenly. My boyfriend also got a ham sandwich and he seemed happy haha. I guess we forgot to get much actual Mexican food to really try this place out!  I give three stars for the slow delivery and food that was just ok (except the juice - thats pure heaven). Not bad but certainly didnt blow me away either. Also the minimum order of $30 for delivery was a little frustrating. We will try it again thoughfor sure, especially since we somehow forgot to order much real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Nasty food. Ordered a whole chicken and it must have been cooked and sitting under a light all day. Flavorless, dry, and disgusting. Save your money and pick another spot."}
{"text":"My bf & i would normally go to Hamburger Hut next door for chicken fingers and fries - you pay like 8 bucks for a four piece with fries +1 ranch. We came across Senor Pollo a bunch of times on fb and wanted to try the chicken and fries for 5.99. Last month we called in and put it an order for pick up. Rami took our order and was very helpful with what they had and different flavors etc. On the phone we ordered 2 chicken finger combos: 1 all hot & the other 3 bbq, 3 hot. I also asked for extra ranch and he answered all of our questions politely.  When we picked up our food, we got their $1.50 tacos & he gave us free samples of the carne asada meat  He was so nice and he threw in a bunch of extra ranch for free, extra hot sauce and salsas. We told him we'll be coming back more often.  All of the food we had was so good and worth the money! $1.50 tacos & $5.99 6 piece chicken fingers fries and drink"}
{"text":"Been waiting for delivery for over 2.5 hours... I would LOVE to review the food but I fear I shall never try it"}
{"text":"I ordered at 6:24pm, food should have been at my place at 8, but didn't arrive until 8:24pm. I ordered a burrito, taco, fries, and wings. The fries were lukewarm and not all were edible cuz they were cold.. and anyone whose eaten cold fries knows they're disgusting. The burrito was ok, didn't have the cheese like I paid for. Now was gave it 1 star are the wings. THEY STILL HAVE FUCKING FEATHERS IN THEM!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! Needless to say I trashed them and did not eat a single one. Idk how this place has 5 stars. I will NEVER order from here again and I'm GLAD I bought through grubhub so that I could get all my money back. 2 hours for this. Feathers... Luke warm food even though it's in a warming bag. Ridiculous. Disgusting."}
{"text":"It's amazing although they are a bit late on their delivery but when they do bring it. They always add a couple of extra items and it always makes my day . Amazing Mexican food by the way!"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup order  California steak fries sandwich Quesadilla plate with chicken  First of all my California steak fries were missing guacamole. That was a big disappointment considering you pay for it. Meal was... ok the quality of ingredients is poor  The cheese they use for the quesadilla is almost unappealing. Even Roberto's taste way better then this place  I don't think I'll be back. It wasn't good or memorable. Just \"bleh\" kind of wished I put my money towards another meal"}
{"text":"I definitely should have read the reviews before ordering. The only reason this isn't getting five stars is due to how long it took to get food. It took two hours. Now I've worked in restaurants I get having a busy restaurant & it taking a bit more time for deliveries, but I feel if it's taking two hours for delivery then maybe it shouldn't be an option? Maybe just stick to dine in & carry out. Other than the ridiculous time to wait, the food was delicious. For how long it took to get it we were actually surprised it was hot. The enchilada style burrito was so good, really filling! We also got the three taco combo with carne asada which was really good as well! Overall this place has great food quality. We will definitely enjoy this place again, next time dining in instead of delivery."}
{"text":"New in town coming down from California and getting to know Las Vegas so I have been ordering in for a few weeks now and wanted to get something different so I tried the cat fish I have to say one of the best fish I have eaten and we ordered the chicken husband was thrilled with it really good food has very good flavor only down part was the delivery was slow but I have to say it again really good food I can say I will be ordering here again 100%"}
{"text":"Extremely Professional, love the Food from here, even when it's about too close they are willing too take a order. Manager here rocks you can notice he has a good connection with his employees n you can also tell he has a very good bond with every customer that walks thru them door!  I'll always come here instead of some where else. Senor Pollo Rocks Baby!!!! Keep up the good work. Employees also Rocks !"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery for the office. When we received our meal more than 2 hours later it was cold. The hamburger was raw not pink in the middle. The chips and the guac were delicious as were the radishes. I am so disappointed...  Rami made up for this experience! Our second try of burgers, taquitos, and a torta were very good. We also tried the roast chicken which was amazing! It melted in your mouth. The rice and beans were worthy companions to the chicken. I have never had beans with takeout that were that good. I will definitely be ordering again...maybe even pick-up for a delicious meal at home. Thanks for making things right Rami!!! You have earned more customers!"}
{"text":"Flavor of everything was amazing. Chicken was delicious and juicy! Burrito was stuffed and rolled perfectly. Carnitas were on point. Carne Asada was juicy and bean and cheese burrito was perfect! This place is great we will be back."}
{"text":"Okay I came here to use one of the multiple yelp offers this place has posted, namely the 15% off coupon. I ordered the standard lunch plate and a drink which consisted of rice, beans, a Mexican style roast and tortillas. I get to the cashier and show her the yelp coupon and then I realize she doesn't speak one word of English. Lol finally I communicate what the coupon is and she calls someone over the phone and then finally hangs up and says $11 dohlars!!! Wow 11 bucks for a regular lunch plate with a coupon used as well? The food on taste was a 2 out of 10. Fairly bland and nothing to get excited over. But 11 bucks for gas station lunch line food is insane!!! Skip this place and go next door for some decent cuisine that is half the price as this joint!"}
{"text":"I ordered wings from them on grubhub a while back. They called me back telling me that they didn't even have wings in stock and asked if I wanted to order something else. I said \"no thank you, would it be alright if I could just cancel my order then\". I am not rude to people who handle food. Life's rough. I went to order from them again to give them another chance, and they are no longer on my grubhub. So I find the phone number to ask why. The lady who answered the phone said \"well if we can't deliver to you then there must be a reason why\"... Whhhhhat!? I just hung up the phone. I couldn't even fathom that kind of customer service. Did I get blocked from something that wasn't even my fault and I kindly declined to order something else. I'll never know because she didn't have an answer for me but I guess the people there just don't care about their service."}
{"text":"Delicious! I just received my order (delivery)   Love love just wish I had found you guys sooner moving now  But I hope you will deliver to my new address. I ordered 2 plates of tacos with rice and beans, half roasted chicken combo, and a medium size order of fruit . One taco plate for me now, then the other my roommate and the roasted chicken for dinner."}
{"text":"Yes...it's in the hood. That's where all the comparisons end. The first thing I look at is how clean and establishment is. This place is very clean. The service was very professional and courteous. The cheeseburger was very good and had a \"homemade\" quality to it. I recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was awesome ! I ordered for delivery and Rami took care of us personally , I felt like he went the extra mile tonight ! I would recommend this place if you really want some good Mexican food ! THANK YOU RAMI !"}
{"text":"This place has the best Menudo, the service is wonderful they treat you like family. I will continue to come here. I truly recommend it to the world!! I love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from UberEATS here and I was seriously disappointed . I ordered a half chicken with green salsa and guacamole  I paid $2 for the guacamole and I received a tiny little cup with guacamole that is enough for 1 taco. The chicken looked nothing like what I saw in the reviews and on their menu, it was undercooked and seemed like they threw it in a pan with water into the oven."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place a few times. Each time I have enjoyed my meals. I wish I could say the same each time for the customer service --- but 5 out of the 6 times I've ordered here there's always been a very awkward and strange experience and ending with something from my order missing. Be it having to wait damn near two hours for the order to arrive or somehow ending up in a text conversation w/ the delivery driver for updates on the food as if it was a friend who owed you a meal on the way. Each time the food is so good I tend to overlook those errors. Each time i'm offered something for the mistake but I forget about it and never take them up on the offer --- except for the last time, I ordered 3 pounds worth of catfish (the catfish is amazing here, can't deny that truth) yet they delivered 1 pound and two catfish combos, not equaling 3 pounds or even 2. For that blunder I was offered a free pound on my next order. I accepted and made sure I would use it. It was much deserved for the error. So, today I call to place a delivery order and a woman answers the phone and I place an order (At this point I made it clear I was ordering delivery and not pick up) then I added on the pound of fish and explained to her that it should be comped. She then gets quiet and says \"We aren't delivering\" I go, \"what?\" She matter-of-factly goes \"we aren't delivering at the moment\" I say, \"Well, every time i've ordered here its been around this time and its been delivery\" -- More silence. I then go \"you know what, I'll order on Grub-Hub but i'll need the fish comped\" she begrudgingly obliges and takes my number down and says she'll contact the manager and get back to me. \"Ok, you'll get back to me.. when? I'm ordering food, can you let me know a time\" She mumbles that she'll call me right back and we hang up --- Well, two hours and 20 missed calls (and one where they picked up and hung up quickly) --- I have no call back, and no food. This is not only the worst customer service I've ever experienced but the most disrespectful. Judging from most of these comments they don't have many loyal customers if any at all but they just lost me."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Definitely returning to try other things. I had the mojarra and it was on point."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more disappointed, i drove all the way from north east vegas to have some of the great food I've been hearing about,it said they open at 9am got there 5 after 10am and the lady tells me that they don't open until 10 then looks at her watch and says  oh it's after 10 then tells me the food isn't ready yet which me being a chef it's understanding opening a few minutes late,but i stood in the line by myself for 30 minutes until i asked when the food will be ready and they asked what i wanted and i said some delicious roasted chicken,they said that would be another hour so i said how long for hotwings they said an hour as well..grrrr i want to try the food so bad.:-("}
{"text":"Im from Chicago and I'm telling Seinor Pollo has the best Mexican food hands down. They have the best authentic Mexican food. And best customer service if you use Grubhub this definite is about to come to."}
{"text":"When I went here the customer service was great! Tacos where good but they forgot to put sauce on some of them. Only problem I had with this place is that it's pretty difficult to find. I don't mind it being in a liquor store but at least have some sort of sign indicating that the restaurant is inside the store."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. I have not had anything that I didn't like. The customer service is great also. Everything is better than you would get in a chain restaurant and worth giving a try. The prices are great also. Try the fresh fruit punch or lime cucumber water. Both are awesome."}
{"text":"We used them using Grub hub - AMAZING food, service & delivery.  Our order actually arrived 30 minutes before estimated delivery time.  Food was hot & delicious.  My husband made sure I remembered the name, so we can order again."}
{"text":"Prices were a bit extreme for how little we got. Chicken was weird and not at all we would would have minimally hoped for. Only positive was the hot salsa was perfect amount of hot."}
{"text":"This place must be having some problems. I just ordered food for delivery and after an hour of waiting, I get a call saying my order was refunded because the place is closing early. So I don't know what that's all about but why wait an hour after I've placed my order to let me know? I'm starving.... Oh well"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Can't complain at all. It's always fun to see the differences in Mexican culture from coast to coast, I have to say that Texas still has everyone beat. If I'm ever in vegas again, I'll check them out."}
{"text":"Fucking disgusting. Never eating here again. Really expensive and no flavor. It literally took 2 hours to get my food. I timed every minute. This place doesn't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"Been living in Las Vegas for a year now and had been looking for a real authentic Mexican spot. I FOUND IT!!! Their food is so delicious! They are friendly and always ready to take our order. We're always trying something new and we are always happy with our order!!  keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new Mexican spot out and from the reviews, and especially the deal offered on yelp, I decided to try it out. The restaurant shares its space with a liquor store so, at first, I thought I was at the wrong place. After going in, I seen I was at the correct place. I went in and the lady had to ask a gentleman in the back about the yelp deal and we were able to use it. The gentleman asked us if it was my first time and I told him it was. He allowed me to taste the different meats that he has. I forgot what the name of it was but I chose steak. I got a burrito with steak and it was really good. The gentleman was so helpful and very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place . I have not ever been disappointed  by the  food . The service here  is top notch ! I had ordered chicken soup with  some rice and it totally  kicked my colds ass!  Weeks back i had ordered  chicken with rice and beans. The beans were something I've never had before ,super delicious! Rice fluffy and flavorful. The chicken was very juicy and tender. If you want good food and great service , come here you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"Was hungry and decided to use yelp for nearest restaurant and came across this one. I read the reviews and looked like it was a good place to try out. The place is not fancy at all but I ordered the mild chicken wings special with fries  and omg they where very tasty. The fries where good enough as well. The only thing is the waiting time but the cashier or owner was really friendly. Spent $20.50 on 2orders of chicken wings and 2 hamburger orders which is not bad at all. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"It was alright, after all the hype on Facebook my hubby and I went down to the hood. Yes this place is in a not so great area of town.  We ordered 5 hamburger specials for 4.99 each and an order of taquitos and a chicharron taco. If you want an excellent hamburger go next door to hamburger hut. These hamburgers were good size but just alright, not crazy good like all the reviews had said. The fries were soggy but to be fair we didn't eat them till we got home. My hubby did not like the taco at all and he knows a good chicharron taco. The taquitos were alright as well they don't give you enough guacamole or crema and no cheese I was disappointed. Overall I'd say save your money and go next door to hamburger hut they have excellent burgers as already stated and broasted chicken."}
{"text":"We put in our order & 20 mins later the food arrived! The delivery guy called to say he was on his way, he is very friendly & personable. Thumbs up for the fast delivery & excellent customer service. I ordered the torta, it arrived with soggy bread but it's to be expected since it was being delivered. It was packed with flavors & juices in the meat. We got the shrimp ceviche that was fresh & delicious. The chicken burrito was excellent, not greasy compared to other Mexican restaurants. The only down side is that the chips was not as fresh as I'd like them to be. Minor detail I can overlook. I do recommend ordering from here."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the owner is such a sweetheart they got a little busy and had few people ahead of me the owner personally called me to apologized and kept me updated with my food the wait time wasnt longer than average I love this place and will order food tomorrow"}
{"text":"We got lost when we exited the freeway and thought to give this place a try before trying to find the freeway entrance. The place looked busy which is always a good sign, I ordered house special which was half a chicken with sides my wife ordered the fish, to our surprise the food wash delicious, we did wait a bit for our order to be taken but it was worth the wait. I added this place to my favorite unknown restaurants."}
{"text":"Been to the first location. Man it was amazing... Food is sooo authentic. I usually dont like mexican food but man I am a huge fan. Definitely going back. LOVE THE CHICKEN TACOS!!!! YUMMMMM!!!!!! Go here for delicious eats! Fast and Great Customer service..."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best wings in vegas by far...and at a great price you can not beat it"}
{"text":"TRASH.  Its like a gross ass food truck inside a convince store.  I highly do not recommend this place.  Just turned my stomach thinking about the food poisoning this hole in a hole caused me"}
{"text":"I have to say this is worst senor pollo I ever ate at I spent a lot of money and only one item was good ... I'm very upset and will not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know"}
{"text":"Went there for the frist time yesterday 3/21/16 for some lunch.I ordered their 12 piece mild wings. I used the check in offer the employee at the time did not know how to in put the discount  she apologized about it I told thats okay, I still wanted the wings she asked for help a male employee then called the owner, the owner  helped him with discount. The owner gave me more discount then what the check in offer said which was awesome he did not need to do that. That's what I call great customer service I will definitely be coming back to try their other food."}
{"text":"We ordered our food at 6:45pm and were told it would be about an hour wait. At 8:00pm we contacted Eat24 (who we ordered through) to find out the status, they said the driver was busy but that he should be here in 15 minutes. At 8:30 we contacted Eat24 again, they called the restaurant and were told that they were busy and the driver had already left. There was no offer from the restaurant for anything free or a discount off our next order or anything. We FINALLY got our food and what we found was just ridiculous.  To start, I ordered a hot dog with fries for my 8 year old. Needless to say that, by this time, the bun was hard. What was more annoying was the fact that it was covered in jalapeños, pico de gallo, mustard, and relish. A strange combination for anyone, but inedible for an 8 year old. My problem is that none of that was listed in the description, it just said \"hot dog\".  Additionally, my sister and I both ordered chicken burritos, admittedly they were huge, but when I cut mine in half I noticed something weird. I pulled out a Lima bean. A Lima bean? In a chicken burrito? I thought maybe it was a fluke but as I ate the burrito I realized that for some reason there were mixed veggies in my burrito. Looking at the pics on Yelp it looks like their sides of rice have mixed veggies in them (still odd for a Mexican restaurant). Apparently they use that same rice in the burritos. It gave them such a weird flavor that we could each eat only about half of the burrito.  Our experience was not good, the food wasn't as described and the wait time was terrible with no effort from the restaurant to fix it."}
{"text":"I love ordering delivery from Senor Pollo... my favorites are the catfish, the fried chicharones, and the burritos. They areally always timely and accurate."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and place is closed.  Like as in closed down no longer open for business, closed. Walked into the little market and where the section for the chicken is empty. Asked the man behind the cash register for the market, said they are all gone. Which is crazy since there are chicken food signs all over the outside of the market and someone just left a review 10 days ago ????"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. and waited. now don't pass this up because you think it's going to be bad. keep reading here because honestly, I'm telling you we waited a really long time - it seemed like it took forever BUT ...  If I could give this more stars I would, enough stars to equal Pi or infinity...  the reason the delivery took so long is that SENOR POLLO gets REALLY, REALLY busy. and that is because the SENOR POLLO CHICKEN BURRITO with green salsa is the best - it is - THE Most AWESOME chicken burrito in all the land, and totally worth the wait.  advisory and fair warning === their green sauce has a kick, and I say this because others do not like spicy heat as much as this pale-faced red haired gringo. So to compare, on a regular basis I search for spicy foods, and eat fresh and pickled or nacho style jalapenos and habaneros, and the SENOR POLLO green salsa is a match for upper notch heat.  The SENOR POLLO red salsa is liquid fire and I have never been to a restaurant that had salsa that was TOO hot, at least never until now, this is so hot, hot, hot it will set your ears on fire but it's good and the green salsa is (great) soooo yummy, yummy, yummy, goooooood....  you can not leisurely walk to SENOR POLLO, you must run, and bring a friend or three as they will thank you.  I recommend  the ENCHILADA STYLE BURRITO, (wet) it's the Chicken burrito dipped in the green salsa (salsa verde) with cheese on top and then it's heated in the oven, oooey gooey heaven.  the TACO is a \"street taco\" style of your choice of meat with onions, cilantro, and green salsa, Mmmmm... chicken or beef and others....   For your friend not in the mood for Mexican fare,  they can have a HALF CHICKEN that is better than most roasted or rotisserie style., it's not spicy, but is juicy.   Next I am not usually a fan of refried beans, but SENOR POLLO beans are good enough to eat with just green sauce sour cream and chips.   and remember to get the flan... now, if they are open - go eat at SENOR POLLO... I know you will say thank you, and you're welcome... ask for the Izmeeem special... it's not on the menu - Yet, but it will be..."}
{"text":"They no longer except Yelp deals. The party store owners now run the restaurant too. Nice people, but TOO BAD if you purchased a \"deal\". NO MORE DEALS!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant but that quickly went into disappointment. We order the enchilada style burrito, the California steak fries, two shrimp tacos and a steak burrito and sadly all were sub par. The steak tasted like the frozen steak-ums you buy on sale at the grocery store. Nothing had flavor just piles and piles of spice and heat with absolutely no warning. I love recommending restaurants to my followers but unfortunately this will not be one of them."}
{"text":"It took our order 2 hours to get to my door.  It's unacceptable! If you know it's going to take this long don't take orders so far from service. Lessen your coverage map. It ruined our appetite and was a complete waste of $55"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Vegas... Customer service is just as good. Got a great deal on here Pay $15 for $30 worth of food. I always get my wings Well Done and they were spot on perfect."}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  Was starving at work and needed food. Should have visited the vending machine instead.  The chilaquiles had to be the worst I have ever had. A semi hard fried egg and dry tortillas do NOT a good dish make.  The Fruit bowl was to include strawberries, instead there were green-rimmed cantaloupe and tasteless papaya. I do not expect 5-star cuisine, but AT LEAST let me feel like the $22 I spent on 3 non-meat items was worth it.  The best experience....THE DELIVERY DRIVER & the fish taco.   Sorry folks...WILL NOT BE a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Very good quality food authentic Mexican food best in Las Vegas. Very professional  people too I come here once every 2 days and I wish I can come everyday. I would really recommend this place."}
{"text":"I literally called 20 times before closing and I was hung up on every time, music, then hung up on. Called Rocco pizza."}
{"text":"There are things that should be obvious to anyone in the foodservice business. Food should be served hot, completely cooked and you should get what you order.  Senor Pollo failed all three today. The worst by far is the shrimp ceviche. It was supposed to be crab ceviche and the shrimp is raw. Not into death by toxic seafood poisoning."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in town!!!!! I ordered a DELIVERY!!! (Yes you Hurd right!) to my work and then to my house for my fiancé to try! By far the best chicken quesadilla we have ever had! There carne asada burritos and street tacos were also very good!!!! They do fresh juices as well! The man who takes your order and delivers is very nice!!!!! I will for sure keep ordering from this family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and Rami is super nice, makes you feel special! The green sause they make is probably the best green sauce in town in my opinion, full of flavor and nice and spicy!!!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite new place to eat. I have never been disappointed with the food or the service here. Everything is delicious. I would be hard pressed to recommend anything specifically because like I said, everything is delicious. The staff is amazing as well. If I could give this place more stars, I would."}
{"text":"Really disappointed today, I've ordered twice from this place for delivery and after an hour and a half I contacted Eat24 and was given the message that my food was ready and was on its way. Five minutes later the restaurant calls to advise that \"thanks for your patience your food is coming up and then on its way to you. Then another 30 minutes later it shows up. First my \"shrimp\" ceviche was plastic container \" there might have been 2 shrimps minced in the cup of pico de gallo. The chicken wasn't all that good, I could have gone to Costco and gotten better tasting rotisserie chicken. The tortillas were heated up hours ago shriveled up and hard. The previous time it had been 2 hours and they said were sorry we got busy behind people didn't show up whatever. Same excuse, this was the last time no mas!"}
