{"text":"Pho Ga was one of the best I've ever eaten! A little off of the traditional version but the bokchoy and quail egg were enjoyable none the less. The broth was fresh, rich and perfectly seasoned. 
My colleague had a vegetarian version of the red curry and throughly enjoyed it. Nice portions and a great value. Service was excellent and the chef/owner came out to greet us after the meal. 
I started off with a fresh cold spring roll with tofu. Very fresh and tender with a side of hoisin and splash of sirracha. 
I often pick a local place off yelp to explore the flavors a city has to offer. This was a total 5 star win. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went here for Pho based on other reviews and was not disappointed. It was delicious, the portion was extremely generous and it was inexpensive. Will definitely be making this my go to"}
{"text":"We had Vietnamese take out and we were disappointed. Food was mediocre, flavour isnt there. We had pho, pho tom yum with seafood and fried spring rolls. Broth needs more flavour, cinnamon and cloves in the pho was overpowering that was all I tasted and smelled. The dipping sauce with the spring rolls tasted like water and fish sauce, not a proper nouc cam, at least squeeze some lime add some brown sugar. It was a waste of money and will definitely go to Mekong River instead i Etobicoke are (viet-thai-chinese fusion resto close by), at least their food is better."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Thai spring rolls and Pho Ga, my date had the beef pho. Both were amazing! I wish there were size options, but whatever you don't finish you can take home, which works for me! The staff was super super kind. Overall awesome experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here at this recently opened Viet-Thai restaurant!  The restaurant is small, casual and inviting.  They have two distinct menus - one for Viet food, and the other for Thai!  My boyfriend tried the pad Thai and I had the Tom yum pho!  Both were delish!!!   Food is very authentic as well - as the chefs are Thai and Viet.  The pricing is a little higher than the average casual Asian spots (came to $28 tax in for two people), but for the deliciousness, good quality and large portions (and also generous amounts of meat and seafood), I think it is well worth it (not to mention I'm a very keen supporter of local businesses!!). The general manager, Tim, also gave us complimentary apps to try!  Service was quick, helpful and pleasant, and atmosphere was overall very family-friendly!  I will definitely come back - especially since there aren't a lot of (authentic) Asian cuisine options around here!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I ordered take out 45 min ahead and showed up when they told me to, on a Sunday at 7:10, the restaurant was empty except for a dirty table with a big bone in the bowl. 

Service. 1/5. They asked me to wait a few minutes for my food and I did. I went for a walk and came back ten minutes later and I waited outside as I didn't want to rush them. Five minutes later I went inside and my food was still not ready. After reading all the good reviews I was happy to wait. When I got home I realized they didn't give me the rice I ordered. Thanks. 

Food 3/5. With no rice I had to add my curry dish to my pad THAI. I tried both on their own before that and neither was great, plus way too many peanuts in both. My wife liked the Cold rolls and they were okay But I have had way better. Overall, nothing was great and food was average at best. Add horrible service and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Got take out tonight and really enjoyed our food. Fresh and tasty. Our two year old loved the glass noodles! Looking forward to trying more of the menu. We will definitely make it a regular place to eat and get takeout!"}
{"text":"Yeesh, I feel kinda bad about being one of the few to rate this spot below its average but based on our first experience ordering in from them it's an experience that deserves telling. 

In our house, we have a fairly standard rotation of ordering In option. It's either Thai, Indian or Pizza, with very little deviation as these are the options that play best to a household with a vegetarian and an eats-everything-a-tarian.

South Etobicoke is no stranger to Thai food either, there has to be at least 10 decent options BUT DGVTC (there's no way I'm writing that name 4-5 times in a review) really fell flat for me at least. It was ordered via Foodora and that was a great experience, the food arrived hot and within 25 minutes based on our proximity to the restaurant. So full points there to whoever deserves them.

My issue simply was with the food. It was half-assed, lazy Thai food. That might sound harsh but it is what it is. I have a theory that when it comes to Viet-Thai food, while the countries are close in proximity and there are similarities to their dishes, restaurants should choose one or the other and excel at it. 

DGVTC (see what I'm saying) offers traditional Thai (even the famous Massaman curry - dubbed the kind of curries as I've read) cuisine and then also has Ph√µ? I decided to keep it simple and we ordered a mango salad, a vegetarian Pad thai and a Street Style Pad Thai with extra shrimp and made Thai-Spicy.

The mango salad was as it was supposed to be, a mostly green near perfectly ripe julienne mango salad with some other vegetables for colour. Where the lost me was on the Pad Thai. This is likely one of the most popular and most ordered Thai dishes and so it makes a great barometer for comparison - kinda like a burger but in Thai food!

The shrimp were a good size and ordering extra was a good idea, but the dish was pretty bad. The noodles barely had any sauce on them or coating of any kind so even on a 5 minute travel time they were congealed in a mass of singular noodle upon opening. There was very little taste with the supposedly 'more flavourful' street style version of the dish. In addition, I enjoy spice and typically when I order something Thai-spicy it means that they use additional Thai chilli peppers in the mix. DGVTC gave me an unmixed dish with a literal pile of crushed chilli flakes poured in the corner. What's worse is my fiancee who does not do well with spice received the exact same 'pile' in her corner. So not only did I not get the flavouring or cooking I requested but they almost ruined her dinner by tossing an abundance of chilli flakes on/in it.

This is why I call it lazy Thai food. It doesn't take much effort to ensure you properly season/sauce a dish like this, incorporate the requested changes into the cooking of the dish AND not just tossing the contents of a crushed chilli pepper packet onto not one but both dishes - what if my fiancee had an adverse reaction to spice?

With so many other options in the Longbranch-Etobicoke area, I think we'll move on and save DGVTC for emergencies only...

{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!! I've been here 3 times now, and each time the food and service were awesome. Vietnamese and Thai food, lunch and dinner menus. Owner Tim is friendly and motivated to serve delicious food with good service. He said he is hoping to introduce authentic Vietnamese dishes not normally seen. I'm really looking forward to seeing that! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp through search for Thai food for takeout. Food was great!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe for their Thai dishes, but not so much for pho.

I'm from Orange County where pho restaurants are abundant.  I am also Vietnamese.  I came here on vacation with two other people for a quick lunch.  We were all starving and wanting some pho.  I was down to try something different and went for their Thai Tom Yum Pho ($13).  My sister and mom shared a Pho Ga ($9) and a Wonton Soup ($5).  Each pho dish that came out was HUGE and definitely shareable.  I thought it was weird that it didn't come with a side dish of mixed Asian greens and bean sprouts to throw in like most typical Vietnamese restaurants provide.  Instead, everything was already thrown in for you.  I wanted to love my Thai Tom Yum Pho but it was bland AF.  I didn't expect it to taste like pho because Tom Yum Pho doesn't exist but it sure as hell wasn't good or flavorful.  My sister and mom that had the Pho Ga thought theirs was whatever.  It didn't taste like pho and was on the bland side too.  The only thing that was good was the tiny $5 wonton soup.      

The entire time we were there there was no other person who dined in.  Most were take out orders.  Besides \"pho\", they also had seafood dishes, meat dishes, vegetable dishes, different types of dry noodles, salads, different variations of spring rolls, and curries.  The service was good.  The lady was really nice to us and food came out pretty fast.  The inside is very small.  This place just isn't for me and recommend not getting the pho here."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and always prefer to support local businesses, so I was so hoping this would be a good experience. I wanted delivery, but opted for pick up due to weather. Their website really strong arms you to order through Skip The Dishes, which was a bit annoying, but I decided to give it a try. The website gave me a pick up time and I got there on time. Empty restaurant which was a bit sad to see, but I thought it would at least ensure my food would be ready on time. Not the case, and when I did get the food, the lady was absolutely indifferent to me giving me my food which was disappointing. Nonetheless I was eager to get home and dig in. What awaited me was 4 dishes that seemed slapped together with no effort. Noodles were all stuck together in one glob. The fried rice with tofu had no tofu. The only redeeming food was the Thai Spring Rolls...but that is not saying much. Total price? $52 and change. Needless to say I won't be returning to this place. Shame. Looks like I will keep heading over to Feast of Dilli down the street to pick up dinner."}
{"text":"Love the food ....so yummy n delicious...lunch was good ...love the pad thai ...definitely coming back here soon..."}
{"text":"We are regulars here! Fast and delicious take out. Best we've had in the neighbourhood. Charming service."}
{"text":"Great place, great food (and selection). we were a group of 6 and we all had different dishes. Green chicken curry, Chiangmai Noodle,Bangkok noodle, pho, wonton, and spicy sour soup. All were flavourful, and a good amount of spices. 

The interior is a bit small and plain but whatever... came for food not for decor :)

Our waiter/waitress were both super nice and even offered to top off the spicy sour soup with ingredients, free of charge. 

This restaurant was different from other viet/Thai places because they don't offer a kettle of tea but that's fine too.

Great place!"}
{"text":"At first glance, this place lights were dim and quiet. It appeared to be closed but it wasnt. There is not much seating which can be a problem during busy times. 

After looking at the menu, I was fairly disappointed, definitely more thai type dishes than viet dishes. I was definitely looking for more of a viet place being the name of the restaurant was viet sounding.

The best part was the food. I ordered the Pho and it was delicious. You can only order one size which is strange since most other viet places give you options to select size. It also felt like it lacked meat which was a disappointment.

I do recommend to try the place and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Great to have new food options in this area. 
I was hoping it was more of a classic pho/Vietnamese spot. The pad thai is OK, bit greasy, could use improvement. Pho bo had poor cuts of various beefs. Broth bland. 
The staff is very friendly, I hope they (just opened) make some early changes. Also offer white meat with the chicken pho (menu has dark only)."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's a great find in the Etobicoke/area.  We've been here a few times, and it's quite tasty.  So far, I have tried a couple of the curry dishes, a few noodle dishes and everything has been great.  I particularly enjoyed the street style pad thai which is interesting (and delicious) and not available every where.  Any of the peanut curry/peanut dishes are also great.

I also like that I can order on Foodora if I want to take out, and eating in is great.  They are super friendly and kind."}
{"text":"I don't really like pho and I enjoyed the pho here and also their other foods (e.g. red curry, Viet spring rolls). Would come back again."}
{"text":"I had high expectation after reading the reviews but was disappointed by this restaurant . First of all there is no AC and bad air circulation so if you go there on a hot day you will steam. A lot of flies on the window.
Tried the mango salad , mango was fresh cut but not the other veggies or fruits .
For main dish I took beef, it was ok even if I felt the beef did not taste very fresh.
Will not go back"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend without knowing they were new! Their menu has a ton of variety. We had the mango salad, fresh rolls and bowls of pho. All were fresh and flavourful. The man gave us a complimentary dessert! The only downside to them being new is they don't have a liquor license yet. I'll definitely be back soon though :)

UPDATE: As of June 2018, they now serve bottles of beer!"}
