{"text":"Talented, friendly staff along with nonstop entertainment through the week. Regardless of when you stop in, you are bound to catch some local artists doing some incredible things. Definitely a great Noda stop!"}
{"text":"This is a small and comfortable place. This is a great place to just chill and relax. The people here are friendly and welcoming. This is a great place to just hang out."}
{"text":"It's nothing fancy and you need to be fit to enter.  The steep climb of stairs may have you out of breath when you reach the top.  It's rather small but quaint and there is a single bar.  We didn't have reservations so we weren't able to order dinner but they did serve the folks who had done so.  The restrooms were clean and I may visit again in the future if the right show comes around."}
{"text":"Burlesque is Coming Fun show in an intimate venue. Service was great as were the drinks."}
{"text":"Attended for the first time in order to catch \"Completely Hollywood (Unabridged)\".  Show was terrific, and the cozy seating makes the show that much more intimate.  Food is catered in from nearby, definitely have to try that next time.  My cocktail was awesome (ordered off-menu) and it is cool that there is a small table next to you to place it on.  All in all a very welcoming experience and I know we will return soon."}
{"text":"A great venue for the arts, regular performances with a variety of comedy, poetry, music, theatre, etc.  The staff is friendly and you've always got the option of food with the Boudreaux's menu available."}
{"text":"This Venue is the reason I see shows in Charlotte. The owner is a drink wizard and I love the variety of shows available as well as the supportive atmosphere for independently produced productions."}
{"text":"Upstage is a great space with an incredible atmosphere. This event bar always has something going on. From theater productions, slam poetry and music events to comedy shows and karaoke.   The staff are excellent at keeping your glass full and at making expert level cocktails. Fun for private events or a night on the town.   \"The best place in NODA for comedy and home to Robot Johnson.\""}
{"text":"went for the first time on thursday, the entertainment, the drinks, and the service was great. i do hope that they would lower the lights a bit during performances because given the size of the place it shouldnt be so bright when the crowd is so close to the performers. that part felt weird but otherwise a great place that i will come back to and have already recommended to several people"}
{"text":"I'm nothing if not a fair yelper so here's a fair update, and I'm increasing my rating.  I recently went back to Upstage (per my last review I was true to my word and I'll be darned if they are getting a dime in drinks or food from me) for burlesque.  I had out of town guests visiting and that's what they wanted to do.  While the service at the bar was still very slow as far as I could see,  they did have several new servers on staff.  While my tattooed nemesis seems to still be there and still not give an eff about patrons (female patrons I should say) there were several good additions to the service staff.  I'm encouraged.  I still won't lift my no eat/no drink ban, but the service appears to be getting addressed with the new additions.  The older lady acting as hostess was AOK.  She came to check in with us several times.  I am encouraged that notes are getting taken.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Best local arts venue in Charlotte! Great supporter of love entertainment! Awesome stage and manager. Totally recommend! The drinks are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ghostbusters- ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!   Such a wonderful Friday nights night- cast is AMAZING, often hard to keep up with the game, kind of similar to Rocky Horror where u get a goodie bag of items to throw- SO MUCH FUN!!  Food is delicious, service is great- our server Amy always knew when a \"heavy\" game time section was coming up & greeted us with beverages every time we were close to the end of our drinks!!   THIS IS A MUST SEE!!"}
