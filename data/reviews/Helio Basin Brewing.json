{"text":"House beer & the porter are great beers, but try the flights great way to sample the different flavors. Yucatan taco was amazing the War carnitas has a great combo of flavors. Tacos are sold individually so if a couple sound good try one of each. Get the rice it's creamy, spicy & Amazing!! The staff is friendly & helpful. They are really knowledgeable about their menu & beers"}
{"text":"I Arrived in Phoenix for a Sedona vacation hungry and thirsty.... this was just a google search.... OMG it was the greatest find!!!!!! Never mind the mini mall exterior!!! The food and beer are amazing .... I don't normally drink beer  but I might start if I lived close to this brewery.... such flavorful beers and no nasty aftertaste!!! And the food... an incredible chef.... the food partners with the beer beautifully.... Ii ordered the chickpea tostada!!!! I will come here every time I am in Phoenix!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to this spot!  I had heard lots of good things and this place absolutely did not disappoint. It manages to be an absolutely amazing and authentic experience that stand out to me vs. all the other breweries that have popped up in Phoenix the past few years. 

I had the Sonoran dog, which hit the spot perfectly. The beer was great, with awesome seasonal selections to put you into the Fall mood. The highlight by far was the \"Beer and homemade ice cream flight\". Holy crap, what an awesome idea - spoonful of ice cream with a sip of beer. Surprising match made in heaven. 

Highly recommend this place if you are into good beer and great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer - for a place that just opened they already have so much dialed in. Not your typical \"bar food\" either, the banana leaf tortilla plate and fry bread were exceptional, and somehow even better than that - the dessert... just get it and you'll know why. Do yourself a favor and get over the fact that the Blackberry Wheat beer is a \"fruit beer\" - simply phenomenal and easily an everyday beer on a hot day, just damned good. Already going back tonight to taste more of the food, get that dessert, and nab a couple more brews. Staff is super friendly and the owner's kick a truckload of ass. With craftsmen (and craftswomen) like this Helio will be a new and welcome staple in my outing regiment!"}
{"text":"I've been extolling the virtues of the food and atmosphere at Helio Basin since I first ventured into the place nearly a year ago, calling it the best and most innovative Mexican food in town. Unfortunately, something has changed and it disappoints me very much. 

First, the service model has changed, and not for the better. Last night when we came into the restaurant, instead of sitting at a table and being cheerfully greeted by a server, Now you queue up in a line at the bar, quickly peruse a menu, place your order with the person at the bar and then pay in advance. You then get your beer handed to you and a number to take to a table and wait for a food runner to bring your food. If you want water, it's now self-service at a water station --- no ice, just cold water. If this sounds like being in a fast food joint, you're right. Once you get the food delivered to you, there's no further interaction with anyone from the staff. What used to be warm, friendly service has turned impersonal. 

Second, regarding the food, what was a small but really creative menu has now become a smaller, very limited menu. There used to be eight different taco offerings (called tortillas), but now there are five. The War Bonnet Carnitas, which was life-changing good, is now gone from the menu.No more coffee-rubbed skirt steak either. We tried ordering the fantastic guacamole (served with those wonderful chips made from spent grain), but were told that they weren't serving it any longer. Huh? Because we were standing in a line and didn't have the time to completely peruse the menu, there may be other dishes missing from the menu but that I just didn't notice.

I fear that corners are being cut and that quality may begin to slip. The chorizo tortilla no longer had the fried egg on it, which was a very nice touch as the runny yolk would blend nicely with the very flavorful chorizo. Not only is the egg gone, but they are using a different chorizo that feels like someone went to the store and bought a package of Johnsonville sausages to chop up. 

I've told so many people, friends and strangers alike, about Helio Basin, but now I feel the need to call them all back to say the place has changed. I hope that this is just a temporary blip. It used to be a friendly place with a good homey vibe and killer food, but it sure wasn't on this most recent visit. I'm hoping that the owners can get it back to where it used to be. It's not close to my neighborhood but in the past it was worth the out-of-the-way drive ---- I guess I'll just stick to the brewpubs in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everything I consumed from this place was amazing!! I ordered a beer flight and they were all good! My favorite was the House Beer, I don't know what was in it or what kind of beer it was but it was goooood.

The coffee rub steak tacos were amazing, would recommend to anyone who loves tacos and wants something a little different in a good way."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give a review talking about the beer, but they're closed at 9pm on a Friday. The dude that answered the phone when I called hung up before I could ask if they'd be open Saturday.

No surprise that no one wants to be here on a Friday night. Keep up the great customer service!"}
{"text":"The customer service was awesome but didn't enjoy listening to complobehind the wall. The food was cooked well but so much sauce you couldn't really taste the meat. I ordered a blackberry wheat which was ok, I didn't taste any fruit, & it turned out super hoppy. I told the bartender I didn't like hoppy beers so I feel like she should've advised me like she did on the others."}
{"text":"The flight is amazing! The tacos are really tasty as well. It would be great if there was a side of rice AND beans. The menu is mostly ala carte. The plates are nicely portioned. Maybe an option to add sides would be great. We had the guac and it was super flavorful. The minute here is tasty, and not fb tasty. You can actually taste the food as it is described on the menu. Great stop, but it got warm.  So four out of five stars."}
{"text":"Not your typical brewery. Surprisingly good food, sharp and attentive wait staff, delicious beer varieties. Tasteful decor inside. Try the blackberry wheat and the pale ale if you're a beer noob. Their food is made from scratch daily and is worth coming in for alone. The roasted oodham tepary bean blend tortilla plate is a vegetarian delight and their house chorizo tortilla plate is perfect for the meat lover."}
{"text":"First off, Welcome to the neighborhood! Everything was perfect, The food was super tasty and full of flavor with a unique twist on all the dishes. Beer was on point, looking forward to another glass. The staff was attentive and always up for good conversation. Keep up the great work guys!  Will be back again and again :)"}
{"text":"Went with friends and everybody loved it!! All beers are really worth  trying. Each one, stands on its own. All have a nice clean finish. Makes it easy to order another. You can see the brewery through the backroom windows. 

Hungry? The menu is WOW! Dishes are creative and unique. You won't find these dishes anywhere else. We had Chicharones to start. Light and came with a buttermilk sauce. The whole table liked em. The individual tacos are amazing! Again, unique.  I
 had pork belly and my husband the chorizo.  Both yummy. You can tell it's all home made.

You have to try this place.  Atmosphere is laided back. The beers are all delicious. You have to try them all. The staff is knowledgeable and fun. The food we ate was excellent. Very worth the visit."}
{"text":"Exceptional, if a little pricy, artisan tacos. Good beer. Atmosphere is current, but doesn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. We shared 2 taco plates (beef and pork, can't remember names) and both were fantastic. The hot sauces were also very good. Our kids shared the corn bread and taquitos - both were a hit with these picky eaters. We did a flight of beer and most were good, some a little less, but the Paradisi was awesome - hoppy, fruity and refreshing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beers are fantastic.  Not overly bitter like some places are trending.  Food is excellent and a bit different than most breweries.  Hats off to the brewmaster AND the chef!  I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Staff was incredibly passionate and excited about the brew and food...which were both amazing! The tortilla plates were unique and well thought out! Great place for foodies!"}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance while waiting for a friend! Awesome place! Great craft beers. Had some chili and guacamole that was out of this world! Even had some fancy ice cream for dessert. Played some connect four while chatting over some awesome food. Will definitely be back with more friends!"}
{"text":"This place is such a great addition to the local brewpub scene in and around Phoenix. The beers are amazing here and are definitely some of the smoothest and easiest drinking brews I've ever had. The Amber was the most interesting and unique beer I've had in a long time and everyone else that was trying it was saying the same.

I've had two visits so far and tried the majority of their food, all of which was far from your typical pub grub and absolutely delicious. The tepary bean puree is very hummus like and pairs well with the pickled vegetables. The green olive guacamole is definitely one of my favorites and the spent grain tortilla chips are the perfect vessel for it. Their banana cornbread is simply addicting. All of the tacos I've had are bursting with flavor and a very welcome change to the typical bar food lineup, and the best part is the spent grain tortillas actually hold the tacos together until you finish. Did I mention that they locally source their food?

The staff is friendly and helpful and make each visit a delight. Always looking forward to my next visit.

P.S. - When you travel to this gem, which you know you should, look for the sign that says \"BREWING CO\""}
{"text":"I'm amazed by this place, the beers and food is waay more delicious than I expected for it to be. The atmosphere and service is pleasant and chill. Definitely glad I live near by this gem."}
{"text":"In terms of location it's a bit south of our immediate restaurant comfort zone but after reading the reviews we gave it a try.  Wow!  The food was delicious!  

Loved the Sonoran Dog & Tri Tip Tacos.  The Blackberry Wheat Kraft Beer was delicious!  And the most uniquely delicious item was the banana cornbread.

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Visited on labor day. Had a slightly hard time finding it at first, but that might have been directions fault. The place is really barren, slightly sterile look to it, but I'm guessing it's because they've only been open for such a short period of time. Place is really large, probably good for large groups. 

The beer: they have a limited selection right now, but hopefully they'll expand. I really liked the blueberry wheat. Their sampler tray is super cute and a great way to try their beers.

The food: Great tortilla plates! You can either get one taco for $6 or two of the same for $11. I highly suggest bringing a friend and splitting the tacos, they're unbelievably tasty! The veggie one was really good as well as was the taco with avocado hummus."}
{"text":"We check out different restaurants often and this was a great find!!   We read about it in the September issue of PHOENIX magazine - AZ Beer Guide. But it was better than what we expected. The menu is small but we tasted several different items and each was better than the last. This Chef is destined for greatness.The craft beer menu was a nice variety and although I don't like sweet beers the Blackberry one was so light and refreshing. My husband is a die hard beer lover - a true Brit and loves IPA's. He found several he liked. Although it was a 40 min drive it has the potential to be our fav go to place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is simple and good...small menu but food is spot on.  Great beer too.  I don't review, but this place was worth it."}
{"text":"LOVED IT. There is something for everyone. We came with a group of adults and kids and everyone was satisfied. They have a variety of tastes, from cheese crisp and orzo soup for the kids to flavorful pickled veggies with hummus, salad, steak, beers, etc., for the adults. They are extremely friendly, accommodating, and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun."}
{"text":"Good beer and food but food portions are small. I got the Taco Tuesday special and they were very good but did not fill me up."}
{"text":"This was my fourth time at Helio and will be my last. Prior to this visit I would probably give them 4or 5 stars and is why we've been back. The beer is good and the food is not your typical bar food. I've had both taco dishes and the Sonoran dog as well as the cornbread. All are excellent but it's been the same limited menu for some time now. It's getting a bit boring. The reason for the 2 stars is the music. Not only was it loud (we asked if they could turn it down but they said no) but it was obnoxious rap/hip hop with foul language. Really??!!!  Very disappointed as we really liked the place and had high hopes. We will not return. Don't waste your time when there are so many other options."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great service, it's a trifecta! Had the chorizo and pork belly tacos, both yummy. Tried all the beers that are out so far they are all very good! Looking forward to the rest of the flagship beers."}
{"text":"Such creative food is awesome. So many restaurants try and over due it but I have to say this spot on. It is a must try!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, great  beer. Then, excellent food. Top it off with good service from a server who knows the menu and knows how to make recommendations that enhance the experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came back 2 months after my last experience.  The place was empty, maybe 4 people there.  Server came up to us with the menu...still only 7 beers, no wine, no other beer, no liquor.  I see that they are trying to get a liquor license, but that is something you should do before you open.  The ambiance was not good, very boring, sterile environment, not at all interesting.  As my companion enjoys wine, and I enjoy more choice in beer, we left without ordering.  There is no compelling reason to return.  I hope this place does something to get and keep customers."}
{"text":"Solid brews and delicious, unique eats!  The Blackberry Wheat and the Porter are exceptional but all of the beers in the flight were fantastic!  Super friendly and knowledgeable staff!  I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best thing ever! I got the War Bonnet and Honey Chicken. 2 tacos and a pint for $10! Great place for a fun lunch."}
{"text":"Literally the best tacos I have ever had. I ended up trying 3 (pork belly, chorizo and skirt steak) and everyone was spot on and incredible. We received great service as well and all the beers we had were very good. We will be back for sure and cant wait to see these guys grow."}
{"text":"they play pink floyd and the urinals are kegs. good beer tho but needs more things to do/look at inside. has a hospital vibe"}
{"text":"This is where you want to go if you're in the area. For starters, all of their crafted beers that are made in house are amazing. This is not your everyday bar food, it is beautifully crafted meals that leave your taste buds begging for more. Top that with a great staff who ensure your experience is beyond satisfactory. The list goes on folks, but the plain and simple, go here."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but my husband and I didn't find a beer we liked here. We tried four different options and decided to keep moving on our brewery adventure after realizing we didn't want anything available. We spoke to someone who frequents this place after and they recommended we try darker beers next time (just not what we were craving in 95+ heat) and to get something to eat as the food is great. We aren't from the area but maybe the recommendation will help others in the future. It was quiet and slow when we went in over the weekend. Plenty of seating and parking."}
{"text":"Amazing, not what you would expect. The food is great, different, unique and the beer is so clean. Very nice. Will come back again with my friends."}
{"text":"Great braised pork belly, great cornbread, great beer."}
{"text":"Great beers and great food in this gem. Staff is very attentive and easy going. The hot sauces are fantastic! Robust porter and the American IPA are solid core beers and the seasonal beers are all great."}
{"text":"Although the food was good, the price was high for what you received.  For $12, you get a steak on the stick appetizer with 3 sticks.  You do not get much for that money.  The price could easily be cut in half for that.  The cornbread was just ok.  It tasted dry.  The tacos were good, but the steak taco was not tender and it was cut in huge pieces so when you bite into it all the meat comes out at once.  The pork and pineapple taco was good but the dry onion rings on top did nothing to compliment it.  I took them all off.  If you don't drink beer, there are no other options for drinks on this menu.  I understand the wine license is coming in about 3 months.  For 3 people with a tip, our bill hit $100.  That was not a $100 meal.  I hope this place makes it.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Helio is in a strip mall, but inside it was nice and roomy.  Great beers and interesting food, I would recommend this to anybody in the area, I was visiting from Denver and on the way to the airport, stopping to watch some football and have a few beers."}
{"text":"So I needed a little place to escape the routine and I had never heard of this place so I went. It was barren when I entered, but the service was very nice. I had a beer, then another... they beers are tasty and one might think that is what matters right? So I have kept coming back to this place, some days there are quite the clientele and it is a very heterogeneous crowd too which appeases me. 

But their brown fall brew is amazing. I have come back just for this on a stressful day at work. Just to sit back, have a really good beer can make the difference some times. 
The atmosphere is partially standard bar, but it has some space. It isn't big but big enough. I feel that if this becomes the standard in the valley, Phoenix will rise again."}
{"text":"Wow! This place exceeds other 5 Stars that I have given. We should be able to rate the food and beer separately. Both are great here. I tasted 4 beers I think. Autumn Oak Nut Brown, Kaki Imperial Coffee Stout, Robust Porter, and Blackberry Wheat. (Not in that order). All were good. But Brown was different than others I've had. Ordered the Blackberry because it was recommended to pair with the Pulled Chicken Verde pub tacos. The food was more adventurous than I usually try and had ingredients I would never have used. Great. Seared Banana Cornbread for dessert. Wow. Most of the music was good and not too loud for grumpy old me!  May be my new favorite for Phoenix. My husband had the coffee rubbed tri-tip tacos, which of course I tasted. Amazing. 

Taking home some Helio Basin mustard hot sauce.   

Very clean too. This chef and brewer are great."}
{"text":"Simplicity and greatness... Skirt steak tacos were great.. Friend got the vegan tacos and loved it... 7 brews across the spectrum... Loved the porter. Worth the trip if you are tired of the large scale over done breweries..."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the beer, service and food is excellent! Beers are true to style, and main ales taste exactly the same each time, so you know that they take the brewing seriously!"}
{"text":"Get the blackberry wheat beer, you won't regret it. Lovely fruit aroma without an overbearing sweetness to the taste. They mean it when they say it's subtle, but it's the perfect balance. I didn't try food but I'll be back to get the blackberry chimichanga!"}
{"text":"We came in from out of town and our hotel clerk recommended this place. Seriously, no joke, I would fly to Phoenix just for Helio Basin Brewing!! It's that good!  The beer is yummy, especially the Blackberry Wheat and my husband said the Robust Porter was the best Porter he has ever had.  

But let's discuss the food.  The tacos were not only the best tacos I have ever had, they were quite possibly the best meal I have ever had.  Do NOT leave this place without trying the Pork Belly tacos.  Also the chicken and goat cheese was to die for.  Apparently their cornbread is amazing so we are going to have to go back again before we leave.  Not too far from the airport so that will make it easy for us to grab our last meal before we catch our flight home.

The best part, though, was the amazingly friendly people, from the gal who greeted us at the door, our waitress, and the manager, who all stopped by to say hello.   It was 7:30 at night and the brewer (owner?) was hosing down the floors for the night in their spotless brewery.  Truly a labor of love.  

DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE BY!!!!"}
{"text":"The blackberry wheat beer was excellent and the Pork and skirt streak tacos were out of this world!!! Indescribable.....Helio Basin  hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Did someone say steak? NO, I said cornbread and tacos! The seared banana cornbread with cracked pepper honey butter is worth the drive across town. Not to mention the house chorizo hand-crafted tortillas with spent grain topped with a fried egg.  Oh yeah, it's also a brewery and they are delicious."}
{"text":"Cool new spot in PHX! Large space and great southwestern menu. Excited for a new brewery in the area! Cheers!!! Delicious Blackberry Wheat beer. Only 4.9%ABV and 15IBU. and I'm and IPA guy. Looking forward to their own IPA."}
{"text":"The three stars are not a reflection on bad service or bad food.  I went with a friend today for lunch.  He suggested it and wanted to eat there again.  The appetizers were good.  The pig skins were really yummy.  The food on the menu was really different and did not appeal to me.  The flavors and tastes were different.  Maybe this place pushes the limits a bit for me.  I will try it again.  I will try the chorizo and chicken tacos next time.  Maybe the beer aids a bit in the flavor too."}
{"text":"Food is very flavorful,  beer was awesome!  Definitely will be going back!  It's kid of hard to find but its right behind Peter piper pizza!"}
{"text":"The beer here is on-point so 5 stars for flavor and options. Also 5 stars for the food - OMG, I had the honey-marinated chicken taco with spicy goat cheese and I thought I had legitimately died and gone to taco heaven. If you love goat cheese like I love goat cheese, you'd be remiss to not get at least 2 of these tacos.

I give 5 stars for service as well. We sat at the bar and had the big-bearded bartender (trust me, you'll know him when you see him) and he was so incredibly nice and attentive and gave us the suggestion of getting a flight to save a bit of money on the beers we wanted to try.

The thing that knocks it down a notch is the ambiance, or really lack thereof. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting a brewery to be some amazing, fantastic adventure in interior design, but they have holes in the ceiling currently covered with black trash bags... It's not a good look.

I still recommend it if you're a major beer lover!"}
{"text":"Had a few hours to kill before catching a flight out, so the good Lord Yelp steered me in the right direction. Super chill vibe, the bartenders were friendly and open. Beer recommendations were on point and food, even though not the biggest selection, was tasty as hell. 
Lucky find and lucky for the locals !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! They take alot of pride and integrity in their specialty dishes and the entire staff from servers to chef are all very hands on and knowledgeable about every menu item they have."}
{"text":"Great beer and food. Had the chickpea tostada with elk sausage. Amazing flavors! Enjoyed it with Autumn Nut brown.  Thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and beer pairinf.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem ... OUTSTANDING! Beer was great and the gastropub style food was delicious. I'm most impressed by the quality and diversity of the food, felt very upscale but the prices were very reasonable. I had the banana cornbread and  chickpea tostada paired with 3 beers and was very impressed with it all. I don't live close but I will go out of my way to visit again! Lastly to mention we had great service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and beer, very nice place!!!
Especially Alma, the cook helpers. Muy buenos tacos hechos con tortillas hechas a mano, ingredientes frescos y todo muy limpio yo les doy una calificación excelente"}
{"text":"Really interesting food and changing menu. Wild game sausage. Tepary beans. Chickpea tostada. Healthy stuff! Innovative kids menu. And then there's the beer. A session IPA bursting with fruity piney flavor. Saw an imperial coffee stout."}
{"text":"The beer is on point here. I tried everything they had to offer (not flights), except for the house beer which is just a transition beer from piss water to craft. The brew master has refined recipes that produce unique styles and also shows well in the traditional styles like the American Pale Ale. Well balanced beers that meet good specific gravity points that give them a well rounded body and leave great lacing on the glass when done.

The chef has produced a great menu with awesome tacos, the spent grain handmade tortillas are wonderful. The chorizo is maybe the best I have had, the banana cornbread almost made me ask for the whole pan and the pork grinds, well, WOW!

Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Good beer and truly unique menu. I was apprehensive, but decided to try the special spicy pub broth. Surprisingly good! Service was also great. I'd highly recommend if you're staying close to the airport and want a quick bite to eat and a beer"}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and just happened to see the good reviews on this place so we gave it a try. It was probably the best food we have ever had! Everything was perfectly made and beautifully presented. I'm not much of a beer drinker, my husband is, yet I loved the beer we ordered. The staff was friendly and helpful. Try the hot sauces if you get the chicken verde tacos any of the sauces make the tacos even better. Before we left they told us about their deserts we tried the vinegar grapefruit pie. It was the most unique and delicious flavored pie ever! Try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch after reading a review. We were very pleased with everything. The chef is very creative without being pretentious. She uses Arizona heritage ingredients like tepary beans and different pickled veggies. We had the duck sausage tacos which were filling and delicious. To drink we had a porter which was also great. Prices are reasonable and service friendly. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for brunch....had a blueberry mimosa while others had craft beers brewed by Heilo.  Yummy menu with homemade tortillas.  My fave was seared banana cornbread with butter seasoned with cracked black pepper.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Beer is 10 / 10. Smooth IPAs, crafty originals and something for everyone. You taste the beer style first then a hint of the flavoring. Friendly service with a smile. A little quirky which is great. 

Place is 10/10. Great bar with some level change. They really put some money into the TI of this place. Urinals are Kegs

Food quality is 9/10. Menu was 7/10. Food was great but they need develop a few better dishes. But the concept and execution are on point. Just my opinion. 

Check this place out. Drive from anywhere. Enjoy the newest craft beers by some of the best young talent out there."}
{"text":"First time visit here, came in for resteraunt week. First the beer is fantastic, the food is good not great. The main reason I did not give a 5 is that the atmosphere is a bit strange.  Given it was a Thursday night, but the music was a bit slow and the vibe felt out of sort. Will I go back? Yes. I feel that a atmosphere need to be bit different."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because the food was absolutely fantastic and the beer was good too. Server was great and super knowledgeable so no complaints there. The only downside was the atmosphere and it was a big downer. It was a Saturday night, about 830 and there were maybe 10 people in the place and I know it was because the lights were way too bright and the music was pink floyd and other sedate classics. All they need to do is put on some funkier music (ie.. check out Postinos they nail it) and turn down the lights and we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST brewery food. A lot of local breweries have delicious beers, but this place nails both. If this place was closer to my house I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Helio has very good, Fresh and Original food. Beers are all brewed in house and also very good. They have a selection of 6 \"core\" beers plus a few seasonal. What I loved the most, though, was the food. Tried the tacos which were \"to die for\" all with a Mexican flair and an interesting combination of fresh flavors. From pomegranate and pineapple chunks on my tacos, to the side of pickled grapes. 
The only suggestion I have is in terms of ambiance. Their lighting sucks! It is way too bright with energy efficient type of bulbs. All they need is a dimmer switch and Voila!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! It's rare to find a place that has great beer and amazing food. The beer flight was the perfect introduction to the main brews and were all above board. We got the sweet and spicy chicharrons which came out hot and still popping, excellent with the house brew. All the tacos we tried were great. I'll definitely be back and recommending this place to everyone l can!!"}
{"text":"Already feel like regulars here. My husband and I love this place. Beers are awesome and food is delicious. We've tried the pork belly and chorizo tacos, and they are both amazing. We have also gotten the guac every time we go. It's a must!!! The chips are made with the spent grain from the beer - super cool. Service is great, helpful, thoughtful, and fun. Our new go-to place for sure!"}
{"text":"Beer is still delicious... but the food is not really conducive to hanging out for a pint, and the set-up isn't really comfortable for sitting down to a nice lunch. The food isn't super great, either. It feels like they're trying too hard to be unique, but they miss the mark. Maybe add something simple to the menu like plain-old chips and salsa? Or French fries? Give us something to munch on that isn't so heavy while we enjoy the amazing beer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Cool atmosphere, great service, and don't even get me started on the tacos!!! Best tacos my husband and I have ever had!!!! I was born and raised in az and have lived in Texas so I know what tacos should be and all expectations were surpassed. Go here on taco Tuesday's especially! The beer is very good as well. They have a nice choice of core beers, and a very cool selection of seasonal beers as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing place and amazing brews! The flight is amazing and allows you to figure out what \"grows\" on you for taste.  The Porter is my favorite, but you can definitely tell that they have put a lot of thought, time, and backing into this.  Great local brewery!"}
{"text":"Came here for an event and tried a wide variety of food. While I did not try any of the beers (went to the gym afterward), I am confident giving Helio Basin a full five-star review.

The owner is very friendly, outgoing, and knowledgeable about the industry & craft. Additionally, the food was fantastic and unique. The guacamole is incredible. I've never had guacamole with grapes in it but after trying it I am a believer. Unique yet very, very tasty.

Another great menu item is the corn bread. I could eat an entire meal of it, and I imagine it pairs really well with the wide variety of freshly brewed beers on tap.

Bottom line: Will definitely be returning to taste some of the beers, and I'm excited to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Another friend opening a new awesome spot to enjoy an adult beverage. I'm drinking the Blackberry Wheat and it is delicious!! So refreshing, not too hoppy, and ice cold. You have to visit this brewery and try these fresh brewed beers!"}
{"text":"I really like this brewery.  It's very big inside which makes it a comfortable place to hang out, even when it's busy.  They have a great selection of beers, all of which are creative and tasty.  The food is good, but definitely not why I would go in.  Definitely better for a beer or two and maybe an app than going in for a full meal."}
{"text":"Want something the same but completely different?  This place is definitely unique and worth coming back to.  I had guac, two tacos, and a drink (Tuesday taco night), and have not had anything like it anywhere else.  Every item was uniquely crafted by a chef who colors outside the lines to create familiar food items with a twist that you won't find anywhere else.  Even the chips that came with the guac had a texture and freshly-made flavor that prevents me from comparing it to other restaurants.   You just have to try it yourself to understand."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan. I stopped in here for a beer after work and the staff was so friendly it was a nice warming welcome for that after-work atmosphere. The bartender was very welcoming and kind. She suggested a few beers for me and gave me a little background on some of the beers. 

I ended up with the American IPA. It was perfect. Not too red, not too malty; just the perfect amount of hoppy and fresh. My only suggestion would be to chill the glasses. In this sweltering heat the beers get warm pretty quickly. That may just be me though...I nurse my beers. 

UPDATE: I've been back a few times now and their beers are noticeably cooler! 

I can't wait to come back here and try their food. It's light Mexican style bar food. I saw a few vegetarian options on the menu that I will be back to test out. 

There was a waitress that was so sweet and kind, I exchanged a few words with her and she made my day. They left an impression that will certainly lead me back through the doors!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos and split a beer sampler. Loved the tacos! And recommend the blackberry beer. So good!! Service wasn't the best but we were hanging out so it didn't really matter to much. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We've waited WAY too long to make it out to this place but finally did and now know what all of the rage is about! We are so happy that it is in the neighborhood! 

We came late on a Wednesday evening and indulged in some delicious beer and grub. I had the blackberry wheat and it was AMAZING. I am a big fan of Abita Purple Haze and this seriously rivals it, if not better. It wasn't sweet at all but had the perfect hint of blackberry.

For food, we had the sopressata chips to start and they were literally incredible. They bake the meat into the perfect crispy chip form and cover it with sesame seeds. It was nice and salty and a perfect compliment to the beers. For my entree, I got the Sonoran dog because duh. It was delicious as well! It was so big that my husband had to help me finish it! For something sweet, we tasted a tiny scoop of their homemade bubblegum ice cream paired with their 602 Brew. We will absolutely be back for the ice cream flight!! YUM! 

I love that they source their food ingredients from local farms and the menu is very unique. Don't expect to come here and get a burger and wings, Helio is unique and they definitely do it right! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Chicharones!!!!!!! Still crackling from the fryer. Jalapeño corn bread Yes!!! The tacos were great. We got there in between lunch and dinner so no crowd. Beers were ok. The house was very bland no flavor. But I am more of an IPA hop guy. Had a flight of the regular taps they were good and I would go back again if I'm in Phoenix. Though it would be for the food over the beer."}
{"text":"Do not miss out on this place. The beer is great and the food puts this place over the top."}
{"text":"Yeah oooh rah great beer and local food both hand crafted! I had veggie tacos. So healthy so good. Cauliflower broccoli carrots squash onions and a Pima corn tortilla with carrot butter very very good. I had 4 tasters of beer so I could taste the craft. Tasty. Hubby had a porter. A damn good one!!! Try them all!! So good loved them and the tacos and yeah it brightens up the strip mall and it's 10 minutes from the airport. Fly, eat drink, sleep Ahhh!!"}
{"text":"Helio had new and interesting beers on tap as well as food options. We enjoyed a flight of their beers loving every one of them, then enjoyed two different tacos. We are headed back soon to try more of their food. Personal favorites of mine are the blackberry wheat and the honey chicken tacos."}
{"text":"I came here for a Local First promoted dinner with the brew masters. I was surprised Helio Basin is taking residence in an old pool hall I used to hang and drink cheap bad beer at. It's definitely great to see an upgrade in the beer being served at this location - lol. I had blast hearing the stories from the brew masters of how this place came about and how they make their beer. You can tell these guys know their stuff and are very passionate about serving a good beer. In fact their slogan is \"Quality Crafted in Phx\". Not only do they serve good beer, but the food is phenomenon. Chef Tamara Stanger just recently won the Devoured culinary classic excellence award for her smoked bison taquito. About thirty of us were served a four course dinner with a beer paired with each dish. Their IPA and Blackberry Wheat are the big sellers. Both were very clean, crisp and delicious. But I think the Robust Porter was my favorite. It's not too heavy and full of flavor (a nice blend of chocolate, caramel and coffee). My favorite courses were the Palo Verde Torte and the Blueberry Tamarind Pudding. Each dish was beautifully presented and had some sort of representation of Arizona in it. Hello Basin is a great addition to the Arcadia food scene and worth another stop. They have a great happy hour and I hear Taco Tuesdays is a must. Check them out!"}
{"text":"What if I told you that one of the top chefs in the entire state of Arizona is hiding out at a Phoenix microbrewery?  If the name Tamara Stanger doesn't yet fit into your gastronomic lexicon, then file that name away for future use.  Why?  Because Tamara is already kicking ass and taking names at virtually every food festival she enters.  The Tacolandia festival?  First place.  The Roosevelt Row Pie Social?  First Place.  The Scottsdale Culinary Festival?  First place.  The Devour Culinary Classic (the Super Bowl of AZ culinary events)?  Yup, first place.  My only question is how has Helio kept her around this whole time?  To co-owners Mike Conley and Dustin Hazer, my advice is pay that woman whatever she wants.  I count myself lucky to have sampled some of Tamara's creations at these culinary festivals.  From coffee and beer infused tacos, to a hibiscus vinegar pie, to her Devour crown jewel: braised bison taquitos.  Yet despite all of this, I've been to Helio a couple of times for brews but have never had a meal here.  That changes right here, right now.

You'll find Helio Basin Brewing slightly hidden in a Walmart shopping center on the southwest corner of 40th Street and Thomas.  Its next door to the Mattress Firm and around the corner from Peter Piper Pizza.  The inside is somewhat spartan but with plenty of seating for at least 100 patrons and the main bar front and center serving up Helio's in house brews.  As I said, I've been here for beer before and they make some great ones.  In addition to some seasonal and special batches, their everyday brews like their American IPA, Hoppy Amber, and 602 Brew are great options.  They also have arguably the best flight boards in town (wood cutout boards of the state of Arizona so awesome they look like they came from an Etsy or Pinterest catalog).

But I knew all that when I arrived today.  My main mission was to sample chef Tamara's everyday menu for the first time.  I started with their Seared Banana Cornbread.  The cornbread comes with a side of their cracked pepper honey butter.  For those of you like me who are easily addicted to Texas Roadhouse' dinner rolls, eating Helio's cornbread is just like that.  The bread was perfectly soft inside with a firm and slightly crunchy exterior and I could've eaten that honey butter by the spoon full.  Great notes of tempered sweetness to wake up your palette.  When it comes to the rest of their menu, I should note that most of the dishes here are on the spicy end.  Its understandable as spicy food often pairs well with good beer and those spices can impart great flavor, but I had little trepidation as I'm usually a wimp with spicy food.  But one dish that I just had to try was their Smoked Rabbit Pasta (yes, rabbit).  Linguine pasta mixed with slightly spicy tomatillos, house made rabbit sausage, locally sourced olives, capers, anchovies, pine nuts, cheese, and herbs with two warm house made tortillas on the side.  Oh and a farm fresh egg on top if you dare (and of course I did).  If there was ever a dish that encapsulates the full range of Tamara's talent, this is it.  A battalion of great flavors, textures, and mixtures of meat and non meat ingredients.  The rabbit sausage is admittedly a leaner and gamier sausage than I've had before, but the noodles were perfect and the anchovies gave the pasta an extra briny note that worked beautifully to balance out the cheese.  Hell even the house made tortillas were amazing.  An absolute grand slam of a dish on every front.  After finishing dinner, I (briefly) debated whether I had enough room to try out a dessert item.  Then I saw the first item on the dessert menu.  Caramel Cheesecake Chimichangas.  Cheesecake in chimichanga form and covered in beer infused caramel and salted popcorn.  Total time elapsed between waffling and ordering?  About 5 seconds.  Two chimis come in total.  The crust cuts easily with a fork and inside is warm melty cheesecake.  Mix in that caramel and popcorn in each bite and you've got a delicious sweet and salty conclusion to an outstanding meal.

Total cost for the food, a pair of 5 ounce beer samples (because one must at a microbrewery), tax, and tip came to about $50.  Just FYI, the rabbit pasta w/egg is one of the most expensive items on the menu at $22 so that's what drove up the price for me (and was totally worth it).  Almost all of the rest of their food menu items are less than $15 each.  So lest there be any doubt that Tamara Stanger and the brewmasters at Helio Basin are putting in just as much hard work as well as good food and beverage in front of their everyday customers in addition to the festival circuit.  If you're a beer fan, you'll love Helio.  If you're a food lover, you'll love Helio even more.  Which is why Hello is hands down my favorite microbrewery in the valley.  And why you'll want to keep a close eye on Tamara, a fantastically talented woman finding new ways to make you say wow with each and every dish."}
{"text":"So I am really glad this place opened down the street fro my work. A pleasant addition to the growing, quality craft beer scene in Phoenix. After moving from San Diego it was one of the things I missed most. This place has all the potential of making it big. They have really great food ( albeit a tad pricey food imo) but their star is the IPA. Really enjoyable, and my favorite out of the flight we had ordered.
The food was also, really good. Out of the skewers, and the tortillas-yucatecan banana leaf pork belly taco we had, I think I enjoyed the most simple chicharones with my beer. They are sweet and salty pork rinds, which really are the perfect finger food while enjoying crispy beers on a 100 degree day. I also have to give a shout out to the pineapple jicama salsa- so refreshing with my taco in the summer!!

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Best 'craft' tacos on Earth. And, the spent grain tortilla chips with the 4 homemade salsas are so delicious, I can't even deal. What a wonderful food spot. Keep up the good work chef! I heart you Helios."}
{"text":"The beer is awesome as is the food. We had the corn bread- incredible! We also had the tri top tacos and Sonoran dog... so much flavor and straight deliciousness. Love that they are rotating their menu- you always get to try new things!"}
{"text":"My wife and I (she's a non-drinker) went to the Fenix Beer and Music Fest at Helio. I had intended to go to Helio just to try a pint and see what the place looked like. First time there, they got me for $10 each at the door. I was thinking that it bought me something like a couple of small beer tastes or a taco, etc. But we spent that $20 for basically nothing, because I had to pay the regular price for my beer consumption and food. She got expensive (but tasty) tacos, so her investment was $34 for three tacos. I got a couple of beers, one good (the Helio SASS IPA) and a marginal one (Blackberry Wheat) for my investment of $33 or so. Not a good evening as there was a lousy rap singer on \"stage\" in the parking lot and we had to leave. Disappointing \"festival\" in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good variety of beer. Very solid pale ales. The BlackBerry wheat was light and refreshing. Great find."}
{"text":"came in to support the owner and staff...cheers to Mike, Micah, and Chris and have been back several times to enjoy this fine establishment. Good beer and the food is amazing, you wont be disappointed if you stop in!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer. Great food. Amazing people. Little fun fact: the scratch tortillas are made partly with spent grain from the brewing process! Love it."}
{"text":"The beer is good.....The chef, descended from heaven with the ability to please your palate and make you see God."}
{"text":"Well my beer snob buddy said Helio Basin is a go to brew pub and I took her advice. Let's see is this a brew pub that serves awesome beers or a Gastro pub that serves beers along side with 5 star chef farm to table type fare?  

I was welcomed immediately at the bar, Justin?, I explained I was a 1st timer and described my beer preferences. He patiently explained the options and pointed me to their new release IPA.

There new release sassion IPA is a beer that you can drink all day 12 months a year. The all American IPA is also awesome. It's a complex IPA but enjoyable for even the non-IPA drinker. I sampled a few other beers and you can't go wrong.

After a few libations it was time to eat. After reading all the great reviews I knew I could not go wrong. The tri-tip tacos were recommended. Holy moly I am still dreaming of these tacos. Picture three small homemade corn tortillas (just like little grandma used to make) stuffed with perfectly marinated beef, spicy sauce, sweet onion, mushrooms, and topped with a fresh jalapeno slice.  Oh pick a sauce mild, med, maple syrupy, or 7 out of 10 hot. The 7 out of 10 got me hooked. It's one of those hey this isn't bad then it hits you!

Yea, Helio is going right into the brewpub rotation."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not a hipster....so you hipsters may feel differntly about this place. 
This place tries WAY TOO HARD to be edgy and different. Great beer, but food is SO out there and wacky!!! All we wanted was tacos, instead got a varitable garden of weird root vegetables and weeds. 
Tip for the owner, if you have good beer you don't need to try so hard to be chic."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Love the ice cream!!"}
{"text":"When you walk in for the first time, the place seems very sparse. There's not a lot of atmosphere, but then when you order the food and try the beer, none of that matters. 

I was there at lunch and had the apricot chicken tortillas and the chili. Awesome. Just awesome. My friend had the big salad and she loved it. 

This really is one of those places where you go for the food and the beer."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for the first time, and it was really fun! We tried a flight, but the one thing I didn't like about that is that you have to do the flight with their 6 core beers. I would have liked to pick from the entire menu, as we knew going in that we weren't going to like all of the ones from their core list (we're not big on IPAs or stouts, so it was unfortunate we had to go with those). 

Other than that, this place is a good spot. There were quite a few people there, but because the layout is big and spread out, it didn't feel that way. They had cornhole and some board games to play too, which is always fun! They also have a lot of cool merchandise available :)"}
{"text":"We decided to do a brewery crawl last weekend and Helio Basin was our first stop.  I tried the blackberry wheat beer and really enjoyed it. The food at Helio came highly recommended, so I decided to try the mesquite honey chicken taco with apricot and goat cheese...wow, was it ever good!"}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised that this place got such good reviews.  I just attempted to eat the Sonoran Sausage, an overpriced brat.  

I can only assume that they soak the sausage in salt for a period of no less than a year, because what I had to endure was something that I think hunters use to bait animals with.

Fortunately, I had palatable beer to help me forget what I did to myself which is why I'm giving them 2 stars.  Looking at prior reviews of this place, it must have been a fluke, but I won't be coming back.  If I want to eat a salt lick, I'll just go to Cabellas and get one.  It's about the same price."}
{"text":"Chicharrones were amazing. Beer was A+ and the CO2 wash in the growler pre fill was great. Loved the food. Loved the beer."}
{"text":"Good beer good tacos. Usually at a brew pub you only get one or the other food it good beer. The tacos are too big though, they should be Street side so you can try 3 without stuffing yourself too much"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff, excellent food, and brew. Love this place. Happy hour until 6:00 weekdays. $1 off brews and appetizers."}
{"text":"Amber is the pint to get.

Tacos were delicious but meats could have been chopped more finer. 

Overall a very good experience and a great vibe."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing, and the beer is really good too. If you're in the area, make a stop. My first visit was on Taco Tuesday. Got a beer and 2 tacos at a special price. I tried the chorizo, the tri tip, the chicken Verde, and their special that won Tacolandia. The place is quiet during weekdays, but don't let that fool you. The food is good."}
{"text":"The beers were great, my husband had the IPA and I had the blackberry wheat beer. Alone those would get 5 stars, however the tacos were a disappointment. The descriptions were very intriguing but the execution was missing something."}
{"text":"Amazing beer and the flight is perfect. We had the cornbread and it was soft, warm, and the flavors were delicious. Also had the special which was a cheese and meat platter. Restrooms and entire brewery was extremely clean. Very laid back atmosphere and great service. Plus they support the Semper Fi fund!!!"}
{"text":"A lot of driving around and needed a beer. Found this place on Yelp. It was closest to where we were and had good reviews. It's not too busy right now but there are a good amount of ppl. Beer is great and they had cards so we played some \"speed\". Didn't have the tacos bc I had just eaten but the food looked and smelt great. Bathrooms are cool. Kegs for urinals. If I could recommend anything it would be to get a bigger/better sign outside."}
{"text":"The beer was decent not great.  The blackberry wheat and IPA were ok.  The amber was tasty, as was the Porter.  The Kohi coffe stout was something I looked forward to and was disappointed.  Smooth for a 10 percent just not that tasty.  The brewery itself was cool, especially the men's stand up urinal. You will have to see it for yourself.
 One gripe I had was when one of the employees came down to coral Alley's toys, even though no one but us occupied the lower level at the time.  The toys were in no one's way.  Just saying not cool it was only 4 dig treats and they were within 1 foot of us."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great beer.  Friendly people.  And the Savory Waffle is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is a more than amazing place!  Very unique menu and the chef really knows what he's doing!  The beer is amazing and great local brew and great service!  We tried everything and ordered more!  You really have to go explore the menu!  Smaller menu but focuses on something different, quality and perfecting the taste!  They also recommend and pair your brews with the food which is spot on!  Definitely one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"When the foodies I work with suggest a new place to grab lunch, I listen. They are the reason why I Yelp! on a regular basis about some pretty cool places. Which is why I am writing about Helio Basin Brewery. And, I've decided to refer to my inspirational co-workers as my \"culinary co-horts\". At least for now...

I regret that I cannot mention the beers, as this was a working lunch and I did not partake. But I will be back because the selection sounds really good. The Blackberry Wheat caught my attention, so more on that later.

Thanks to my culinary co-horts, I had heard them talking about this place from a prior visit. They kinda pumped up my expectations. And based on my meal, I can say that Helio Basin nearly delivered what I was expecting.

Their specialty is tacos. The menu is a little confusing at first (tortilla plates) but you soon realize we are dealing with street tacos here. Very creative street tacos. Banana leaf roasted pork? Spicy coffee rubbed skirt steak? And those are two options I passed on!

The tacos I selected featured beer braised pork belly and chorizo. Besides being creative, these were delicious. This is the first time I've tried pork belly. It was smothered in a pistachio and pine nut mole. Solid. However, the house made chorizo with roasted tomatoes, a fried egg and fresh herbs, was mind blowing. The herbs really kicked up the flavor. My only complaint was that the corn tortillas may have sat too long cause they were on the hard to crispy side.

The menu deserves high praise. It's comparable to what I enjoyed at Taco Guild. Despite some poor execution, I'm definitely making a return trip to try the other tacos. Just beware. These are $6 street tacos. A little pricey, but worth the money!"}
{"text":"Hello Basin Brewing offers CRAFT BEERS and CHEF CRAFTED Arizonian Influenced FINE BAR FOODS.

When you walk in you know your in a Brewery for sure. There's a big bar surrounded by some high tops and take a few steps down and there's a big space filled with a fermentation room with great big vats for brewing. There's bunches of kegs and single tables and community tables.

I ordered the Trout Tacos. I got three street sized tacos on Spent Grain (by product from beer) tortillas. The tacos were filled with rich firm smoky trout, pickled fresno peppers, creamy deviled egg mousse, capers and baby greens. I really enjoyed the nutty taste of the spent grain tortillas and I thought the smoked trout and fresno peppers were an excellent pairing. For me it was impossible to taste the deviled egg mousse because my mouth was filled with smoke so the egg was just something creamy inside.

My husband tried the Sonoran Dog. This sandwich was painstakingly detailed. It was a spicy house made brat, smoked bacon, duck fat beans, stewed nopales, pickled fresnos and onions, picco de gallo, ancient mustard, jalapeño pesto, cotija cheese, crema on a bolillo roll. Now this sandwich had A LOT GOING on. It was an outstanding sandwich.

We were served by the bartender. He was the only working out front when we were there. He was efficient.

4-5 stars depending on what you order."}
{"text":"This is a gem that opened only 12 weeks ago and I must admit this is the best beer I have had in awhile. The staff is great and the food looked and smelled great. According to others that were here it is great."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, and an awesome tasting room. The IPA is especially good - hoppy but not overpowering.  The banana corn bread is to die for, as well as all of the tacos (we tried almost all of them).  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"fantastic! been there 4 times since they opened. beer AND food AND staff are terrific!
go go go"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Arcadia scene.  Clear pride in ownership - high quality food options and tasty beer.  Love the views of the brewing operations from the dining room and the keg style urinals."}
{"text":"Being from out of town we were looking for a unique local place to try something different compared to home. The bartender Chris was nice and the beer smooth. This place will do well."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Porter. This place has a great vibe and attentive and friendly staff. Will be back again and again. Tacos were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Had some delicious beers and killer tacos. It was a tough choice (because of how good a handful of the menu items sounded) but went with the tri-tip tacos, as I was told that they're a fan favorite. It makes sense why. They were loaded with meat and super tasty. If you're going to bring tacos to the table around these parts they better be good, and HB did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Helio Basin is totally solid. Great beer great service and the tacos are extraordinary! I love their American IPA and the Hoppy Amber. For tacos I've had the War Bonet and Mesquite Honey Chicken and both were great. Excited to try more!"}
{"text":"This review is solely for the two porter (robust and autumn nut brown). These were alright. Not strong or flavorful much. So don't come here for dark beer.

Service was nice though."}
{"text":"Tried the flight! All the beers were great!! The food was delicious! The mesquite honey chicken taco was amazing! The goat cheese just topped it off perfectly!"}
{"text":"The place is big & has a great ambiance. I had their Porter & The Husband had their IPA & Citrus beers. All were very tasty. For food we had the cornbread & at first I was a little nervous because of the texture of it. I must say I was pleasantly surprise. It was delicious. The banana leaf pork tacos did not disappoint & I'm not a big fan of quinoa but tried my husband steak tacos & they were also great but would definitely get the pork ones again & now I want to try the other ones. I would say the charro bean were my least favorite just needed more in them. Maybe onions, tequila, & some spicy flavor but I'm use to the ones I grew up with that my friends nana makes so you be the judge....Overall this place ROCKS & I'm definitely going back & recommending it to others as their new go to Brewery!"}
{"text":"Let me just say, WOW. I moved from Phoenix to the Bay Area 8 months ago and in the mean time all these great new places pop up just in time for me to engorge myself with great food and brews for the holidays. Being from the Bay Area now, I'll put my taste above the average person. Helio Basin is about to be one of those places I have to visit every time I'm in town now. I split a beer and ice cream (yes you heard it right, ice cream with a bonus sugar cookie on the bottom) tasting with a friend and everything was absolutely amazing. Didn't have a single flavor I didn't like and I'm usually pretty picky about my beers. To top it off, the ice cream is made from scratch by them so you know you're getting a good pairing and those interesting flavors you're not going to find anywhere else. Also, do yourself a favor and get the chicharrones, they're out of this world. The staff is incredibly nice as well and the prices can't be beat.  Make sure you stop by here if you're ever looking for great craft beer and maybe even a meal to go alongside it."}
{"text":"Another Yelp winner!!! On this cool and calm Saturday, I ventured out to visit this highly reviewed \"Hot and New\" Yelp business. Upon seeing Pork Belly Street Tacos listed by another Yelper - I was down to chow! Being a fan of Microbreweries, I was expecting to see an atypical setup; but something was off about its location. I've been to Walmart and Dollar Tree and Onos Hawaiian a dozen and I have never seen a brewery setup there. I quickly realized upon my arrival that it was in a strip mall in the proverbial blind spot of the area, which explained why I never noticed it.

It is located on the backside of the building located (where WSS is) on the corner of 40th and Thomas. As expected I ordered what other Yelpers ordered - Blackberry Wheat beer, Seared Banana Cornbread, and Pork Belly Tacos; but I was definitely tempted to try the spicy coffee steak tacos... I may have to come back for another visit.

The Blackberry Wheat beer was not exactly my favorite of beers, but it will 'get-ya-there\". The tacos though... almost indescribable. Its like something out of the wild hallucinations of an exhausted Chef who was worn down by standarized flavors offered by the same old same old foods. The pork belly tacos were minty, spicy, and sweet. It was like my tastebuds were confused by the flavor explosion and decided to pick whatever flavor it wanted. If you dont know what to eat, eat here. The flavors of the food are uncharted territory.

Ending the meal with the cornbread was a great way to finish a satisfying meal. It was subtle, sweet, and a little crunchy.

My total came to just north of $20 just for those three things, so it is pretty expensive to eat here.

This is a must-try place!"}
{"text":"Food choice is limited, but the I had the Sonoran Sausage and it was perfect. It had a distinct Phoenix touch. And bacon on top???  That is incredible. I wish the beer was better, but they are working on it. Music choice was spot on."}
{"text":"2 tacos+pint 10.00 EVERY Tuesday. GREAT tacos, AMAZING service with good environment. Highly recommend giving this place a try. Had the Amber, very clean and balanced. Enjoy your experience!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I completely forgot to review! What a great place. I hope it makes it.
We came on a recommendation from a friend. Service was prompt and very friendly and very knowledgeable. 
I had an 8 beer flight. Personally, I'm not a hoppy IPA type guy but I did enjoy the other offerings, notably the black berry wheat, the porter, and the oak nut brown.
We tried the banana cornbread which was awesome. And then had 2 tacos....one of which they altered to have no meat. Both the sweet potato/ portabella and the War Bonnet tacos were just great. Even the tortillas were soft and sweet.
Great food, great service all in a beautiful building."}
{"text":"The best food I've ever had at a brewery, hands down! Complex flavors that I want to replicate at home. The porter and nut brown are also rad!"}
{"text":"Stopped by just for a couple beers and munchies with hubby on Friday night. 
The atmosphere was okay...the lights were a little too bright and the space too wide open for our tastes, but I'm sure when the weather is warmer and those roll up doors are open, it would probably be pretty cool in there. But the service was great and very friendly.
The beer was really good. I had the Blackberry Wheat and hubby had the Robust Porter and then the Kohi Imperial Coffee Stout. He's more of a hop head, but he liked those both very much and I really liked my choice. 
DO order the Banana Seared Cornbread with honey butter with cracked black pepper- delicious and addicting! Hubby got the the Chorizo Taco with and egg on top which he loved. We also shared the Beer Beef Sticks rolled in jalapeños..very tasty...especially with their homemade Serrano and ghost pepper hot sauces!
They also make their own homemade ice cream. They have one called Pistachio, Date and Black Pepper that was the total bomb! The flavors go awesome together and we loved it!
The place is a bit of a hike for us but we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Soooo goood- go here! We liked the seasonal beers and the beer and ice cream flight. Yes, a beer flight with ice cream pairings. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this brewery a couple of times and enjoyed my visits.  They are located on the southwest corner of Indian School and 44th streets and set back a little bit from the road.

The interior decor is pretty basic.  The have a bar that sits about 20 people with two televisions and plenty of tables for parties of four or more.  The brewing area is very visible and it's fun to see them actually brew the beer.

They have six core beers and a couple of seasonals.  I've tried their IPA and pale ale. Both were just OK.

Yesterday I was here for taco Tuesday.  For $10 you get two tacos and a pint of one of their six core beers.  That is a great deal!  

The two tacos (they call them tortillas) are made from the spent grain from the brewing process.  All of the variations listed on the menu looked good and I went with a pork belly taco and a skirt steak taco.  Both of these were incredibly delicious and flavorful.  In fact, they may well be the best food I've had at any brewery.

Make sure to give Helio Basin a try.  They are a great option if you are in that part of town."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. I absolutely love the flights, especially that they are served on an Arizona shaped board. The food was the best part. Usually you go to a brewery and get your typical brewery food (burgers, fries, wings, etc). But here the food was so UNIQUE! We tried the Chicarrones + Cactus Dip, as well as the Chickpea Tostada! I was hesitant when I first saw the menu, but the blend of flavors was amazing. We finished off with the seasonal pumpkin chimichangas!"}
{"text":"Don't let the surrounding strip mall detour you 
This place is awesome.  The beer is great. We didn't eat but the food looked outstanding.  For sure will be back!!  The coffee porter was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday special in town. A thoughtful,  gastronomic delight. Brew Master and chef have illustrious pedigrees and the product shows. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place just opened ! Our waiter was helpful and always available evening though his territory seemed quite vast. This is a great big open space to meet up with friends. Beer is excellent, small plates perfect and with lots of spice and flavor without the grease and breading you always see with bar food."}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer. 1 star for the brunch. Average of 3 stars.

One of my friends had been here previously and was incredibly impressed with the Sunday brunch. So we decided to try it again with a larger group. However, when we got there, the brunch menu had 3 food items on it. That was it. Don't advertise your Sunday brunch and then have a pitiful menu. Needless to say, we decided to switch venues.

On the other hand, their beer is fantastic. I ordered a beer (the hoppy amber) before seeing that their brunch menu was tiny. It was such a great balance of hops and malt. A couple of my friends had made my same mistake and their beers were also quite good."}
{"text":"Went here for a get together with friends. Very few beer selections with under 25 IBUs. The menu wasn't that wide but the descriptions of the items was very accurate. If you get the guac and don't like cilantro tell them know up front as it is tossed on just before serving. The service was actually good and consistent all evening."}
{"text":"Great coffee stout--loved it! Great vibe, loved it! The guacamole wasn't my favorite, it had grapes:/. Other than that the service was great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and epic beers.  We sampled all the beers for $2 a piece and enjoyed ever single one!  Impressed with the fresh take on locally sourced food and the combination of food and drafts.  Great view of the brew tanks, large bar, and well thought out.  We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Chef Tammy is killing it. We had the chickpea tostada with elk sausage. The tangy dressing on the kale counterbalanced the rich, delectable flavor of the chickpea flavor. The charred onions added a touch of bitter and umami. The kicker was the hint of cinnamon in the crisp tostada. 

We also had the banana cornbread with sweet butter and tepary beans for appetizers which did not disappoint. This chef is on to something. 

Oh. And the beer is equally delicious too !"}
{"text":"Great local farm to table food. Sonoran sausage was great and had an amazing smoked flavor. Tri-tip tacos were great as well. Homemade hot sauces were delicious. Great beer and staff was really great!"}
{"text":"This place redefined my expectations for brewery food.  I started with the seared banana corn bread.  The bread had a crisp perfect crust surrounded by moist bread with an ideal amount of real banana flavor.  I had the Sonoran sausage sandwich.  This consisted of a large tasty brat on a fresh roll topped with a variety of items like nopales, bacon, pickled onions, peppers, beans, and a bunch of other savory goodies.  It was beautifully plated and looked as good as it tasted.  The creativity and perfect execution of these edgy AZ recipes sets this place apart from a lot of restaurants.  Get to this place."}
{"text":"What a cool atmosphere! Got a tour of the brewery and tried many different beers! They are all super creative flavors, and great beers. The food is also amazing!!! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went today for opening day and everything was great ... the food, the beer and the service! Excited to have this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Awesome little brewery with a great selection of craft beers. If you like stouts the imperial coffee stout is amazing and super smooth for being at 10%. Also you can get a flight with all their core beers for only $10!! Please check this place out and ask if Alex is bartending he's awesome!"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. And yes! All of the beers here are on point to say the least! The tacos are all good, but the very best are the mesquite chicken, the chorizo, the war bonnet, and the pork belly! Appetizers are ALL good, the guacamole, chicharones, and corn bread are the BEST! The staff is great, on top of things but not evasive. The restrooms are clean...seriously, that's a big deal! The environment is super casual, but really nice! So thankful that we got this place in my neighborhood!!! Come and check it out, you won't be sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"Unexpected find on my way to Home Depot. I tried the IPA as any hoppy gal should and I was definitely pleased. I asked for recommendations on starters: beaf sticks, and banana cornbread. I cannot emphasize enough how awesome these apps were. I asked to try the homemade tortilla and stiiiill not disappointed. I can't say often I'm blown away unexpectedly on food, but I happily was today. I'll be back soon to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"first five star I've given out. even if this is walking distance from my house. Great music, real delicious tacos, a very focused and delicious beer menu. beer pairing for dessert, extremely helpful, cheerful and knowledgeable staff made the experience 5-star worthy. a welcome addition to the neighborhood, likely going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer. Great food. Excelled service. All enjoyed with great company. 

Enjoyed the Sopressata Chips and Sonoran Dog. Also sampled all Core Beers and Seasonal Beers on the menu. We're in love and will definitely be back. 

Awesome event space too!"}
{"text":"This is a foodies' brewery, wow!  We were totally impressed with the quality of both the excellent beers and the unique and creative food offerings.  If you're looking for burgers and wings go elsewhere.  We had a sample flight of 6 beers which honestly we're ALL excellent.  We really enjoyed the Shim Sippa Session IPA which was light and delicious and the Blackberry Wheat which paired perfectly with the pulled chicken chili Verde tacos with local goat cheese and maple glazed apples. Yum!  We also had the Moqueca which was amazing and chocked full of seafood.  This place is a winner.  Good food, good beer, good value, easy parking--- we'll be back."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!!! My hubby is the beer drinker and he is loving the crafts but I can't not mention the food. I had the chicharonnes with nopales and beer cheese and they are killer! Saw what everyone else is ordering and can't wait to come back! This is a must stop by if in the neighborhood. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Tried Helio for the first time last night and loved it!  We started with the banana cornbread and had to order another one because it is to DIE for!  The meat skewers were fantastic as well.  The tacos were so flavorful and inventive.  Very interesting combinations that work out deliciously.  We finished with the ice cream/beer pairings.  A little weird to pair beer and ice cream, but a good way to try both.  The ice cream is made in house and is soooo good.  Also very different flavors and conbinations but very tasty.  The beer is really good too!  I loved the house ale and the blackberry wheat.  Definitely a place I will be frequenting often!"}
{"text":"The beer was delicious, and the food amazing!!! The blackberry wheat beer was smooth, and the blackberry flavor danced along my tastebuds.  The Oodham fry bread dish is fantastic.  White tepary bean puree, and topped with the most amazing selection of pickled vegetables that I have ever had including pickled grapes!!  Three of us shared this amazing dish.  Next time I won't be sharing, lol.  It was superb!!! The chef is a genius! Don't take my word for it, get your behind on down there!"}
{"text":"I loved the beers I tried, and the Sonoran dog was delicious! I'm definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The tacos are amazing.  Very unique and ridiculously good! Hot sauces are fantastic. The beer flight was great. Oh and the people who run the place are so friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you haven't, you must. Any foodie who hasn't given this diamond in the rough a solid collage effort is seriously slacking in there expansion of fantastic food and beer in Phoenix. There kitchen does close a bit early for summer hours, call ahead or check the website for kitchen hours. 
It is a big floor plan, family friendly, clean!!, And completely amazing. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Helio Basin is amazing. Great beer and very unique food. Only thing that would take this to 5 stars is if they had better prices. Taco Tuesday deal is really the only affordable time to go."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to take me to this new brewery right around the corner from my house and I was blown away!!    The beer is great and the food is exceptional!   We ordered the guacamole that had green olives and red grapes which was such a nice compliment to the avocado.  The spent grain chips were made in house and were amazing!  We also ordered a tortilla plate with mesquite honey chicken, apricot pepper compote, spicy goat cheese and a homemade tortilla.  The rest of the menu looked amazing and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Had the Chicharones and a mix of the Tacos. In the Taco hierarchy the Rabbit Sausage is the winner followed by the tri-tip. The chicken tacos would be the best thing at a lesser place but can only pull third place against this first rate taco flight. Tortillas are tasty but they really need a double wrap.   Chef Tammy is doing real work here. Come for the food and stay for a beer."}
{"text":"Hipster AF!
If you like being around hipsters and talking trash about light domestic beers, this is your place! Look no further! Not trashing it's a nice place with nice people, it really is, just not my style!"}
{"text":"The beer was okay -- rather below-average craft beers.  Atmosphere is a little funky with the white fluorescent lighting.  Corn bread appetizer was tasty.  The tamale pie, a weekend speciality item, could have been good, but was incredibly dry and difficult to eat.  The pork belly taco was decent but dry as well.  The carnitas taco was solid.  We hope the place works out, because it's a cool concept in that part of town.  We'll probably give it another shot in six months to a year and see if they make some improvements on the beer, food, and atmosphere (they've only been open for 5 months)."}
{"text":"Great brewery, friendly staff and good beer. I only knock a star off because there were a lot of IPAs, which I don't drink. Apparently, the IPAs at every tasty though, if you enjoy that type of beer."}
{"text":"Really good beers and epic tacos, the food is amazing. Really good service, bartender was very helpful. I will be back again"}
{"text":"The menu makes it looks like the tortilla plates contain the kitchen sink. They do, but it all works together and is AMAZING. I had the carnitas and the skirt steak and I had some tears when I tried them- last time that happened was Cochon Butcher in NOLA. Perfectly cooked and seasoned meat and all the toppings played so well together. The duckfat charro was also smoky, rich, soupy, and delicious.

Beer speaks for itself, this review is just for the food. Amazing."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the beer here.  Good House Beer and the Porter was excellent.  I didn't get a chance to eat but the food that came out looked great.  The space is very open and probably needs more going on as it has a bit of a warehouse vibe going. All in due time I guess.  

If you're doing an afternoon brewery tour of the area like I was, this should definitely be a stop."}
{"text":"I was in awe of the beers but what I wasn't prepared to be awestruck by is the FOOD.  While most brewpub menus are glorified sports bar cuisine, Chef Tamara writes a menu that is pure culinary poetry!  In addition to the regular weekday menu of tacos and small plates, on Fridays and Saturdays she does full-blown entrees that are nothing short of works of art.  Foie gras creme brulee!  Lamb belly with blood orange marmalade! Trust me on this, I am a foodie who was in the F&B biz for 30 years, and I was simply  BLOWN AWAY!  Do yourself a  favor and get over here!"}
{"text":"I would like this place to succeed, it's a good concept. The spent grain taco idea is great, and all of the food is really good and deserves 4 to 5 stars. The hot sauces are killer. But the beer selection needs some direction. 

1 IPA... I'm all for having a good selection of beers, but a brewery better cater to beer palates and let's be honest, that's mostly IPAs. They need to start producing beers that will draw the beer crowd and the rest will follow if it's good stuff. Give me a Double (or gasp! a Triple) IPA along with all of the specialty stuff that I normally throw out of my beer sampler pack.  Get a signature beer and grow from there. Great food though. Also a bit over priced for 39th and Thomas."}
{"text":"We found this place driving by and decided to check it out. From the start, greeted with a smile and excellent service. The food was fantastic, we enjoyed the tortilla plate with Mesquite honey chicken and the War Bonnet Carnitas followed by their Blackberry Chimichanga. Amazing, will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Cool new brewery in Phoenix!  This brewery is actually quite large, so if you have a big group I say bring them by.

Helio has a large list of beers they make in house, and they are pretty spectacular.  I'm a big IPA fan, so I truly enjoyed American IPA.  They also have a food menu, and they specialize in tacos.  We tasted a few, and my favorite was definitely the House Chorizo (comes with a sunny side egg on top...super yummy!).

If you like beer, and you like tacos, definitely come check this place out!"}
{"text":"The War Bonnett Carnitas and American IPA are excellent. Lunch time on Friday os a perfect time to go."}
{"text":"Came here after work with a coworker a few months back excited to try out this new brewery and its beer. While I will say that the blueberry ale was pretty refreshing, the remainder of the beers I tried left something to be desired -- even the IPA, which I was shocked about. The hoppy bitterness was a plenty but the malt character was lacking in my opinion, and an excellent IPA is able to balance both. I will try them again in the future, but was definitely left expecting more. Nevertheless, I will give 4 stars particularly for the blueberry ale and the attentive service."}
{"text":"Good beer, amazing gourmet tacos. All the food is basically mexican inspired i.e. chicharrones, corn bread, guacamole, etc.

Great deal on Tuesdays for 2 tacos and 1 beer for $10.

Bit hard to seen from the street but it's in the complex on the SW corner of 40th and thomas."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because it has excellent reviews and was mentioned in Phoenix Magazine. I'm glad we did try it, but it's also one we won't come back to.  I came with my mom and sister and we started with a glass of wine for my mom, which she enjoyed and my sister and I split a flight. She thought all the beers tasted the same so she wasn't much of a fan. I liked the flight board shaped like the state of AZ and the berry beer had a touch of fruit flavoring that I enjoyed. We got the cornbread appetizer for an appetizer and it was very good and the flavored butter was fantastic. There wasn't much of it though, which was a disappointment because it was $6, and for what we got it should've been more like $3 or $4.  The overpriced theme continued for the rest of the meal. It was all good, but the entrees are all about $5-$6 overpriced. We got 3 different things since it is a VERY limited menu.  I'm talking like 4-5 appetizers and the same for entrees. We ordered the tri-tip tacos, the Sonoran dog and the tostada.  Again, the were all good-not fantastic, just good and beautifully plated.  Our server was excellent. He was the only one there, so he manned the bar, took orders, delivered food and beer to tables, and delivered the bill and was cashier. He did a great job, although there were only a couple people seated at the bar and 4 other tables.  We ended with dessert because who can resist an ice cream flights, especially with fun flavors such as blueberry and chocolate chip and Mexican lime. You can get 4 \"scoops\" on a crunch cinnamon and sugar flat tostado/crispy flat sopapilla type thing for $6 or pair that with 4 flights of beer for $12.   Now the 4 ice creams we tried were all delicious, but I say \"scoops\" lightly because they were scoops more fitting to Tinkerbell or Thumbalina, rather than normal-sized human beings. Again, it was good, but overpriced.  So all in all, I am glad we tried it. It has potential and there is good space inside and it's nice and open, but they need to tweak some stuff-including the menu and pricing and this place will have a better chance of surviving another year in the valley's booming Brewery scene."}
{"text":"House beer and skirt steak taco were tasty! Topped off with pistachio pie served with strawberries which was quite a surprise. Not overly sweet and delectable."}
{"text":"This is a unique place, in a good way. I look at the menu and ask the bartender, do you have burgers? Nope! I never heard of such a thing. So he tells me it's taco Tuesday. You get 2 tacos and a beer for $10.00. I had the chorizo, chicken, tri-tip and a roasted rainbow cauliflower. All of them were delicious. Their beer is very good as well. Very cool place with great food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch today. This is one of those hidden gems. You would never guess that this culinary thrill would be hidden in here. First and foremost it is a brewery with a great beer menu. The Blackberry Wheat reminds me of Christmas. It was heavenly. BUT LUNCH was so much more than \"bar food.\"  The food was incredible. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer.  Never been disappointed.  The Seared Banana Cornbread is a must.  Just tried the Chicharrones with Cactus Dip for the first time,  so fresh they were still crackling when they hit the table.  These are going into the regular rotation.  The Mesquite Honey Chicken Tacos were sooooo  flavorful.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This is some of that best bar food I've had, let alone brewery food. The menu is Mexican inspired and unexpectedly innovative, eclectic and changes with the seasons. They never get lazy and fall back on traditional items like hot wings, pizza or beer battered fish as would appear at less inspired brewpubs. I'm not even a beer guy, I order the food to-go more often than not."}
{"text":"This was a good brewery experience.
They actually have different and good food here in addition to pretty good craft beer. 

Food is a little pricey for the serving size but it's unique enough to justify the price. The beer is good, it's not the highest tier for beer in AZ but it's not average either.

The food/beer combo makes this place unique and worth a visit.
....and then a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Went there for a networking Happy Hour the other night. It was friendly, clean, and the staff was super nice.
I only participated in beerage, but what I choose was tasty (pale ale). The HH had muchies which smelled fantastic, but I pick and choose my calories and beer was where I choose.
I'd go again if in the area!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, grab some unique beers and some killer food . The menu was small - and I overheard it was a summer menu , but I'm not sure . Either way there are plenty of what I would consider artisan meals and appetizers. The food was delicious and the suggestions of beer on the menu to go with the food were spot on .

 I went on a weeknight and it was packed . They had a few bands playing also . The chicharrones and cactus dip was perfect. Great start ! The coffee rub tri tip tacos were also fantastic. Friendly crowd and staff  . Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Meet these guys at the Pizza/Brew festival downtown, the beer was excellent and the people were really cool. Great customer service is the key to a great organization. You guys are on the right track, I wish you well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a special Valentine's menu last night. We started with a crisp bee's knees belgian blonde made with Arizona mesquite honey. We then moved onto a generous cheese plate that included port derby cheddar, stilton white mango ginger, triple cream brie, beemster, jam and roasted nuts. From there we were served a gorgeous lamb belly served with blood orange sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes and broccolini, toasted pine nuts and burrata. To finish off we were served a delicious prickly pear vinegar pie alsamic whipped mascarpone, dark chocolate and mint. Service was overall pretty good for the busy dining room. Everything I just described (while drooling) was $65 out the door (tax and gratuity included), which was a smoking deal for the meal we had. I will be keeping an eye out for additional special event menus at Helio!"}
{"text":"Helio Basin Beers is a new place as of this past July! We enjoyed the 
House beer, Robust Porter and their guest beer: Dark Munich beer from Helton Brewing Co. Tortilla plates (2 tacos each) are substantial! Female chef doing an excellent cooking and presentation of food. Very tasty tortilla plates and did not include rice with ours, but you can for additional $2. Spicy Coffee rubbed skirt steak taco, Honey mesquite chicken taco, a vegan choice of Roasted Oodham tepary bean blend, sweet potato, portabella, arugula, sweet corn and blackened tomato hummus taco all on corn tortillas.
Asked for cotija cheese instead of goat cheese and received it.
Fermentation cellar to take a peak at while there.
Good music and did not distract from tv or conversations."}
{"text":"the chef is so creative!  Although a short menu, the food and beer did not disappoint!  
Friendly staff. Decent happy hour price$."}
{"text":"Helio Basin was on our weekend to-do list and the hype of this place was real. 
Our first time here so I ordered the flight and it was pretty tasty, a few of the selections were substituted but no biggie, we happily drank them. 
Bar service was amazing. He was juggling a few customers and our service was amazing, everything we ordered he seemed enthusiastic that it was a great choice. 
My not so favorite part, I hate to do this.. the food was bland in my opinion. :| we saved our appetite specifically for this place and even with that both of our meals were nothing to write home about. The pie was he best part. Grapefruit vinegar? Yes, por favor! The flavors didn't compete and it wasn't too sweet, it was a perfect slice of pie. 
We will absolutely return but next time we will eat before we brew."}
{"text":"Food was mind blowing. The rabbit tacos are from another galaxy. My girlfriend also thought the chicken tacos were very good. The beer was very good as well. The pale ale was wonderful. Wish I had one of these in my town!"}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely worth the visit. Great beer and tortillas. Started with the Seared Banana Cornbread with pepper honey butter. A little bit of heaven on earth. Warm, sweet with a little spice. Excellent! Had the War Bonnet Carnitas and the Pork Belly tortillas. If you are in to complex flavors, this is the place. Lots of different flavors and textures in each. Liked them so much, I had the banana leaf pork. They also have a nice selection of their own beers. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Sunday brunch and it was awesome! The quesadilla was delicious and the menu has pairing suggestions with every item. The location is the only thing subpar about this place. But the house made ice cream was to die for!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and tried a flight of 5 beers, and each had something interesting. My favorite was the amber, and I typically do not prefer ambers. The food was out of this world. I really love a place that has menu options besides the standard burgers, pizza, wings, etc, and this offered that and more. Sure, the entrees are tacos, but the options of types of tacos you can get are like nothing you will find elsewhere. The chef has put together some very creative combinations. 

We tried both fry bread appetizers. One had a white tepary bean puree and pickled vegetables and grapes on top which were to die for. The other was topped with romaine and tomatoes with a bowl of saffron chili beans and a side of cucumber habanero relish to put on top. 

For tacos, we tried the yucatecan banana leaf roasted pork with pineapple jicama pico and crispy fried onion which was amazing, all of the flavors complimented each other perfectly. Also tried the beer-braised pork belly, pistachio and pine nut mole, roasted corn, cotija and cilantro which I liked, however pork belly is generally too chewy for me. That's just my personal preference though. We also had the mesquite honey chicken, apricot apricot pepper compote, spicy goat cheese, and micro epazote, which may have been my favorite. The last one was spicy coffee rubbed skirt steak, red quinoa, avocado mousse, and sundried tomatillos. 

We also got a side of the smoked duckfat charro beans which were scrumptious.

Our bartender was Mitch and he was a lot of fun. I also liked a lot of the small touches such as the plateware used and the decor in the bathroom. The prices were also affordable, not anything too high like I would have expected when seeing this kind of menu in advance. Mitch says the chef keeps adding new menu items so I look forward to coming back and checking them out. There should also be additions to their 5 main beers coming in the future. I highly recommend giving it a try and don't go without trying the food."}
{"text":"Best new Brewery in town. Craft kitchen and one of the best young Brewers in the country. If you are looking for the next local hotspot then you have to check out Helio Basin.

Great food. Great staff. Best craft brewery in Arizona!

Highly recommend the pale ale. The Beer braised pork belly, pistachio and pine nut mole with roasted corn taco was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in a strip mall. A good friend recommended it, and even though it was some miles away we went. The Bree menu was short but our server said there was more. I had the rabbit sausage tacos, Allee had the tri tip tacos. Dessert was a vinegar citrus pie that was out of this world. The place was unusually quiet for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Guac to die for. Awesome tacos. All the food is A+. Corn bread yum. Food is super cheap. Casual. Friendly. Berry wheat beer amazing...not a beer drinker here but love that berry beer. No brainer."}
{"text":"Had a really nice porter, which was great to be able to have in the summer when no one else seems to offer dark beer options. Staff members are super cool. Music is at an appropriate level (audible but not dominating). Really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Very chill spot if you want to grab a beer, bartenders are cute boys to look at and very customer friendly."}
{"text":"Props to their chef! She is incredible and I am in love with her food! The skirt steak and pork tacos were delicious but the venison special was killer! Their beer is equally amazing! I tried the throwback triple double IPA and the American IPA both were awesome! They've only been open for 10 months but they are already killing it! Check them out if you're in the Arcadia area! And if amazing beer and food weren't enough the atmosphere is perfect and there bathrooms are super cool! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The beer flights were great and well priced. The menu was being changed while I was there so I cannot comment on the food much."}
{"text":"Beer and food have sustained humanity through some of its most trying times:

- The monks of Europe made the dark ages a little more bearable with their excellent brews.

And that's really the only example I feel like coming up with right now, but I think that's all you need to get the point, which is that Helio Basin is elevating the oftentimes dry and tasteless Sonoran desert to a whole new level of deliciousness.

So instead of trying to suck the juice out of a barrel cactus or bite a hunk out of a prickly pear, how about you slake your vicious desert thirst with some blackberry wheat beer and fill your rumbling tummy with a sprawling collection of crazy good tacos. Seriously, the tacos (tortillas) here are spot on.

Oh and one more thing - CORNBREAD. I'm not going to say it's life-changing, but...it's pretty close. So go and see for yourself how amazing this place is."}
{"text":"Holy cow! About 6 months ago we started brewery hop, we visit one new brewery per month. Helio Basin might be my favorite so far and it's going to be tough to beat. And to clarify I started gping to breweries long before brewery hop, this place is still in my top 5. Arguably favorite since brewery hop and top 5 overall. What makes this place so awesome, well the beer is awesome, I could drink any one of them at any time. Customer service wasn't but could be better and it might it probably is when they have more staff for busier times. I would also like to note that we didn't try the food today. So here is the bread and butter of what makes this place great aside from the beer. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. The music is loud enough to hear but quiet enough to hold a conversation or concentrate on studies, kind of like copper star coffee. The juicy part is that they recycle, reuse, locally source and are actively engaged in the community. Examples include turning old kegs into urinals and donating the spent grain to be used as cattle feed on a local ranch, the kicker this same ranch is where they buy their beef. That is just a sneak peek, go in to try the beer and read their \"active in the community\" wall. Awesome place supporting the community!"}
{"text":"Excellent hidden deliciousness! I tried three different beers and all were great. I wish I lived in the area, I'd be a regular. The food is exceptional and unique. The service was great. Thank you Mike."}
{"text":"Sampled all 6 of their beers. The house was excellent almost pilsnerlike and I'm not a pioneer fan, but it was good. I wavered back and forth betel seen the amber and the IPA, both are winners!  My buddy loved the porter. Overall, a plus across the board I the beers. 

We had two tortillas-yucatecan banana leaf pork and the mesquite honey chicken. Both were amazing. Full of flavor and large portions. Very fresh and the home made tortillas were heavily. The pickled peppers onions and pears should be sold in jars; loved it!

Definitely go check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great food! Has something for everyone. Cornbread is amazing, as are the skirt steak tacos."}
{"text":"The beer is great and they have a great beer flight option. The menu is a bit eclectic. We ordered the guacamole and the chips that came with it were amazing! I would suggest coming for drinks and a snack."}
{"text":"Drove by this place while exploring Phoenix...great find! Great beers and yummy appetizers. You have to try the Blackberry wheat. So good! Great service, too!!!"}
{"text":"Check this place out !!!! Diverse & impressive  menu (plant based friendly) - friendly service especially the dude with the impressive beard. Beer is super tasty !"}
{"text":"Was here for their music fest. Thank god for a few guest beers because their beers were not very good. Music was good. Didn't try the food because a friend said it wasn't worth getting so we went to OHSO nearby to eat."}
{"text":"\"Spring Equinox\"
I was a a last minute plus one for their first tasting dinner & beer pairing. So the stars aligned to my benefit. The dinner was Private and held on a Monday night, when they are usually closed.
The Eight Course Menu for the evening was not only local, but foraged and indigenous. 
Chef Stanger NAILED IT
My Top Three were Pemmican, Fried Purple Asperagus & I'iotois, and the Wolfberry Galette (If I had to pick three, but I'm not)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Surprised by the quality and taste of their food. Had the corn bread, skirt steak and chicken tacos. Taste is unbelievable! Kudos to the chef. She obviously knows what she's doing. The beer was great too. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by on a Sunday afternoon on our way to the airport based on positive Yelp reviews. Boy do I get what people were saying. This place is fantastic! While the location and entrance is a little unassuming, the inside is pretty cool and the food...oh the food. It's so good. 

We ordered a blonde with the chicken tacos and then a coffee stout with the steak tacos. Choked down on those and decided to try the bananas cornbread someone was raving about. I'll shamelessly admit we ordered another after the first order because they were THAT GOOD. I'd like to give the stout all the credit for me kicking my husband's butt in shuffleboard. 

Overall, had a great time. And honestly, you'd be missing out on some of the best food and beer I've had in a lonnnnnng time if you don't come here."}
{"text":"Beers are very good food not so much, interesting food concepts small menu so it should  be a culinary delight but no."}
{"text":"Had the pale and IPA- both solid. Also tried the blackberry wheat - nice for a hot day at the pool/game.  Atmosphere: nice brewery feel with the operation in back with cornhole games and big beer garden tables. Food: Holy fat!  Had two orders of the tri tip at our table and easily the meat was 40% fat. Fat slabs - not marbling. Very greasy on top of it.  Help was on the spot and helpful. 
Will be back for the beer."}
{"text":"Kahi Imperial Coffee Stout made with Ethiopian Yirgacheffe  at 10am? Yeah! Breakfast of Champions!

 These amazing people offered refuge to a couple of Sunday morning landscapers and let us hobble in a few minutes early for a beverage.

Can't wait to sink my teeth into the Sweet Potato Doughnuts with amaretto maple icing and Biscuits and Gravy with parsnip gravy and fire roasted poblanos.

Afterwards...hmmm...Beer and Ice Cream flight!"}
{"text":"Their gourmet tacos are really tasty. My chicken tacos came with an apricot spread and microgreens and were oh so good. The blackberry wheat beer is worth a try, don't worry the blackberry isn't super overpowering. I like the fact that you can get small glasses of beers so that you can try a few in one sitting."}
{"text":"A diamond in a rough (area!) The outside isn't much, but do yourself the favor of going inside. 

Breweries seem to be popping up weekly and they are the next foodie revolution in Phoenix. Tired of LGO or Postinos or Sam Fox's psuedo local faire, hit a brewery! Sadly most are just so-so and you end up with a $50 bill and a total \"meh\" feeling. 

Helio Basin is a refreshing break from that rut. The beers are delicious and different. The blackberry wheat is just awesome - subtle flavors and great finish.

The menu is unique and the chef's combinations puzzling but delicious. Grapes in the guac - a nose wrinkler at first, but once you try you're a fan! The chips that go with it are a pleasant change from boring old tortilla chips.

The corn bread ... it defies words. A must must have!

The tacos ... big enough to split, albeit it a tad messy to cut. If you do the guac and cornbread then one whole taco is probably enough. If you go with a friend, get two and split.

I'd have to say the flavor profile on the tacos was superior to Taco Guild. 

Costs - put this as mildly expensive. 2 people with guac, cornbread, 2 tacos and 3 beers was $50 with tip. 

The staff was stellar and added to the experience. The manager was friendly and welcoming and even our waitress had a great knowledge of both the beers and the menu. A nice change from what can sound like a tedious repeat of expensive items to boost sales/tip.

Lastly, there are plans to expand a patio area and improve the exterior. Hopefully it'll be dog friendly. 

Well done, Helio Basin! I wished I lived closer, but I will add you to my list for visits to this area."}
{"text":"Beer and ice cream flight is awesome! The sugar cookie it comes with is also delicious. They make their own beer AND ice cream. Cool place in a kind of meh area. Hopefully more spots like this make the area nicer! Said they're having a beer crawl with a bus including Helton and another brewery Saturday 11.26."}
{"text":"Did the Beer flight with dinner, so that this review for what it's worth. 

First, Beer flight was solid. No beer was over the top amazing, but all very drinkable. Not a knock, just my personal opinion. With that said, if anyone  ordered me any of the beers I would be more than happy to drink it. 

Tacos- on point. I had the steak, rabbit sausage and the chorizo. This place might have the best gastropub tacos. Egg on top of the chorizo was downright impressive."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my brother for a drink (or drinks) after lunch. We both for the flight which consisted of 6 3 oz pours. The beer was pretty good overall. What lacked was the atmosphere. The place was pretty dead, only a handful of board games and not too many TVs were on. I like their urinals though - made of kegs!"}
{"text":"Great food that is different and cooked from the heart. The beers were good as well. Friendly staff that's eager to reach out to the community. I'm excited to see what they bring for the future. It was great knowing they actually opened with their own flagship beers. Nothing more irritating that a so called brewery open and not have a single beer of their own on tap. You're just another ale house then and not a brewery. Cudos to these guys! They hit the ball out the part from the opening gate."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Fun atmosphere and DELICIOUS beer! Central location is very convenient!"}
{"text":"Nice brewery, eclectic food menu, excellent beers. Staff was super awesome, helpful, and friendly. Had 6 \"core\" beers and 3 seasonal to choose from. Flights available. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"From Fort Collins , CO (the Napa Valley of beers) so I know a thing or two about beer. This place is top notch. Great selection of beers that are interesting and well crafted. Food is in the same league.  

For beer/foodies this is the place!"}
{"text":"This newly opened place has the most imaginative menu I have ever seen in a brewery. The combinations of flavors and ingredients are sensory overload for your taste buds! The chef has created some amazing dishes using ingredients that you don't think will go together well at first but which turn out to be  absolutely divine. Although I'm not a beer drinker, my husband said their beers were great as well. Had a sticky toffee dessert with mango ice cream that was to die for. Warning, this brewpub is for imaginative eaters so enjoy!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem we discovered when looking for an easy place to eat near the airport.  The food was incredible and inventive and the bartenders were super friendly.  We ordered the smoke duck fat charro (beans), seared banana cornbread and smoked rainbow trout tortilla and all were amazing.  The beer flight was awesome.  Wish we had left room to try the \"homemade ice cream flight\" which is meant to be paired with the beer flight.  We did have the blackberry chimichangas with a scoop of the blueberry chocolate chip ice cream and it was excellent.  So glad we stopped in on our way out of Phoenix- do not miss this!"}
{"text":"The rating is for the food. Helio Basin is by far making the best food in AZ. 

I have never had a bad meal here. On my most recent visit we had the banana cornbread (to die for); the chicharonnes (excellent); and I had the chickpea tostada (amazing). On previous visits I had some of their taco plates and they are worth every bite. 

Their beer has much to be desired although I had the session ipa this time and it was great with the strong flavors of the food. Their beer tastes better in their beer and ice cream pairings, but standalone - i would rate their beer 3 stars. Certainly not bad but there is better beer being made in the Valley (AZ wilderness and wren house, for example). 

10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Chickpea quesadilla with Kale is unique and yummy. Went for taco Tuesday which gets you two tacos and a beer. Great deal! Enjoyed the smoked trout and veggie taco - both tasty especially since the tortillas are made with beer barley. It would be nice to see a fresh fish option (vs smoked) - only one choice of fish makes for a limited menu. Their sauces also are not shy of heat - overall great casual place to enjoy great food and good beer."}
{"text":"What a great place the Beer,Food & Service were fantastic. Make sure you meet Chris he knows his stuff with food and Beer. He is both a foody and a beer snob. Tammy is wonderful in the kitchen she is fantastic and uses the best of local food. Cheers to Mike Tammy & Chris. See you soon"}
{"text":"Perfect place for local craft beer and delicious food! Service is always excellent and friendly. Very cool atmosphere and ambiance."}
{"text":"We had no idea when we walked in that it was their first official day open for business... They clearly are not suffering the same plight as so many other new bars and restaurants in town which take too long to work out the kinks. They are super dialed in and the customer service was over-the-top. Decor is nothing special it's actually kind of bland, but it really doesn't matter. The beers were fresh and crisp and the food is really tasty. The banana cornbread is amazing (although fairly greasy). The white bean purée appetizer with fry bread was super tasty and quite amazing, visually. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Sunday afternoon beer and tried the IPA it was great! The space is huge with plenty of seating and garage doors that can open in better weather. They have a small food menu also but haven't tried anything yet. Will be back to try more beers another time!"}
{"text":"Great beer, but seriously where did the steak and chorizo tortillas come from!!! AMAZING! Definitely come for lunch or dinner when you grab your beer. Staff is super friendly and informative!"}
{"text":"WOW. That is what I thought when I saw the culinary masterwork tacos set in front of me. I don't know anything about the history of Helios Brewery but they are doing it right! Simple menu of fresh, fantastic food and a selection of hand crafted brews.  This is my kind of place.  The menu changes up about every four months to keep you interested in what these mad geniuses have come up with next.

I had the Rabbit Sausage, Mesquite Honey Chicken, and Coffee-rubbed Steak tacos and each was like a flavorful adventure in my mouth."}
{"text":"If you're looking for layers of flavors in your food, from everything from the starter, to the entrée, to dessert, to you drinks, check out Helio Basin.

We went to Helio brewery one day on a recommendation from a coworker, and definitely don't regret it. We decided to try the Chickpea Tostado to start and share the Coffee-Rubbed Trip Tip Tacos .

The Chickpea Tostada came out and I said aloud, \"These ingredients just make sense!\" Do you know that feeling when a chef just whips ingredients together and is hoping it all come together, but it just doesn't? NOT the case with the Chickpea Tostada. The ingredients include a heaping of chickpea puree, crunchy onions, delicious prickly pear grapes, and it's all topped off with purple kale. The flavors come together in a symphony of yumminess.

Next came the tacos, the tacos also had a distinct flavor profile where the flavors just came together. I think I'm noticing a pattern...The meat itself was seasoned well on its own, but coupled with the balsamic mushrooms and jalepenos, the taste was just amplified by the complimentary ingredients. It was also so much fun trying out all the five different flavors of hot sauces with the tacos, and I personally loved the honey habernero.

Finally, and this was absolutely my favorite part, we tasted an ice cream and beer pairing. Each pair had its own unique identity. The Mexican Lime with the American Pale Ale, was tart and flirty. The Pistachio, Date, & Black Pepper was creamy and smooth with the Robust Porter. There was the Blueberry and Chocolate Chip that magnified the Blackberry Ale and the IPA that magnified the Mesquite Cherry ice cream. And c'mon, where else are you going to find a beer and ice cream pairing in the Valley? That's like my two favorite things in the world.

Overall, this was a food experience for the books. Definitely check Helio Basin out if you're ready to have your taste buds blown."}
{"text":"Great find, great folks, great food. Tried the porter and the daily food special and it was full of tasteful surprises! Happy to support this local business."}
{"text":"First time at this location and really liked it. Although the restaurant was understaffed and food took an extremely long time, fortunately for us, our beers and drinks didn't take too long and we had a large group we had a good time. Their Sonoran Brat was absolutely fantastic and probably the best best I've had. It came out nice and hot and had that bbq smell and taste to it. Truly authentic. Overall had a good time, but just lacked employees which caused extremely long delays on getting our food. Like I've an hour. Felt bad for the 1 server that had to serve the entire restaurant at no fault of her own and we did give a healthy tip to her because although she was struggling being by herself she was pleasant and did the best she could with the cards she got dealt.

Overall the restaurant ambience great, very large and open./inviting. 

A little further for us to go here regularly but a good place to check out and try. All their food had compliments from our friends which was great to hear."}
{"text":"Chris at the bar was excellent. I started off with the steak sticks with jalapeño pesto with the blackberry wheat beer. Quite spicy but still delicious. Meat was cooked perfectly and it was a significant portion.  Beer had a crispness to it, and went down super easy. After that I had just 1 of the tacos ( it was the day's special, a duck meat but I forget what else was in it) that was absolutely fantastic. The pickled red onions were a nice touch. I also tried their beans with it, the duck fat broth that they came in was to die for. I had the  citrus paradisi with the taco. I am not an IPA guy and usually stay away from anything with a high IBU but this beer was great. It had a blonde, citrusy taste to start and then a slightly bitter taste at the very end. To finish the meal off I did 4 of the ice creams with 4 different beers. The portions on the ice cream were the only small portions of the day, but the flavor were unique ( I would buy the lime ice cream by the gallon if I could). And it allowed me to try the other beers which were great as well. Great beer, fantastic food and on point service. Stop in and have a glass!"}
{"text":"The food was spectacular with limited choices, very happy. The beer flashy was great and reasonable. Very surprised at limited patrons at 9 on. a Tuesday but their loss."}
{"text":"Great brews, super friendly staff and taco Tuesday with the BEST tacos you've ever had! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I had a steak salad, which everyone was jealous. The appetizers pleased everyone. Beers are great. Casual, prompt friendly service, couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"1st time customer.  Why it took me a years defies expectation.  I go to breweries all over the world.  This place should be crazy packed.  Glad it isn't for me! Compare food to OHSO 1.5 miles away.  For same relative price it was fantastic versus OK.  Beer was exceptional.  I ordered flight of beers because I wanted to sample.  All we're good .  Favs were Amber and Amer IPA.  I'll be back.  Hope it stays Thomas Rd just tougher for a brewery than Indian School or Camelback!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This was worth the drive.  I started with the flight of beers and I just couldn't pick just one to get a pint of!  I treated the food the same way and ended up getting one of each of the tacos, an order of the cornbread and the steak appetizer.  The flavors are really something special. Just make sure you save room for the chimichanga dessert. The big question is; did I like the beer or food more?!?"}
{"text":"Brand new to Phoenix, this brewery is an absolute must visit & will not disappoint. Their beer and food menu is not just another brewery, they have original beers, like a delicious Blackberry Wheat which is now my favorite beer of all time, and a menu like no other brewery...do yourself a favor and have the cornbread. You can thank me later. I had the vegan taco which was incredible & my friend had a chicken & a pork taco and I know she will be writing a great review as well, it's that good! It's delicious, upscale food in a  comfortable atmosphere with great prices & great service."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, amazing food and beer. Taco Tuesday is a great deal if you wanna come try it out without breaking the bank, 2 tacos and a beer for only 10 bucks and these aren't your average tacos."}
{"text":"Run do not walk to this awesome brewery!  If you live in Phoenix and ever drink beer and have not been, well you are just crazy for not going.  Very clean, awesome beer  The gumbo I had today was to die for.  Beer guy Jan was terrific.   The Porter was perfect and then some.   I stopped by on way to Sky Harbor.... if on layover... you should come here.  I was a bit fooled by strip mall exterior but once inside, you are in beer Nirvana.  The very best of Phoenix and I live in Kansas City where we fortunate to have Torn Label!!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. The food here looked and smelled great BUT we didn't eat here. We came here after dinner to try the beer....unfortunately, the beer was for real not awesome. We tried the IPA and the blackberry wheat. The IPA was alright per the husband (I don't like any IPAs...). The blackberry wheat was fairly undrinkable. I never leave alcohol behind, but I had to leave half of this beer. I would like to come back to try their tasty looking food, but I cannot get behind their beer at this time."}
{"text":"How spoiled are we in this area? First Wren House opened a year ago and has been my go-to on a weekly basis ever since, then we got Helton opening just a month or so ago and adding solid beers with cheesy goodness to the scene and now there is Helio Basin! And bonus - I can walk here, when its not 1009903 degrees out! Hope they're ready for their first regular! 

Walking in, I'm expecting the typical growing pains of a newly-opened business but there is none of that - they're clean, fully staffed, 6 beers on tap and kitchen full of goodness ready to serve me. The bartender was a familiar face from AZWBC and hooked me up with a flight so I could sample everything. There are breweries open for over a year now (looking at you, west side) that still have off flavors, growing pains and overall disappointments when it comes to their beer lineups. Not the case here! Every beer was really spot on and true to style - even the wheat beer which I normally do not like due to their sickly sweet syrup add-ins, came out tasting like real blackberry with a welcome tartness. IPA is awesome, went back in for a pint of that one. 

Then the food - my friends kept ordering Tortilla plates and apps so I certainly couldn't resist that. The plates are amazing - such wonderful fresh ingredients, perfect portioned in spent grain tortillas. I lived, breathed and died for the steak one - its spicy coffee rubbed with quinoa in one of those amazing fresh tortillas! Its incredible. My friends loved the cornbread and the frybread and bean dip too. Overall not a single complaint here. 

They're already signed up and supporting the local homebrew club, ASH, as a sponsor too - just another reason to come on in and make this a favorite on your CenPho beer scene rotation! I'll probably be there when you do...:)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: if you just want some plain tacos Super Oscars is around the corner. 

That being said this brewery is great. The tortilla plates they've created are unique and delicious. The seared banana cornbread is amazing. The chicharrones are good, the guac is good. I haven't had anything here I didn't like. 

Oh yeah and the beer is great. The vibe in this place is very laid back which is also nice."}
{"text":"Well from what I can tell this place was created by basic white people for basic white people. I did quite enjoy the food and somehow they managed to copy my high school music playlist"}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading great reviews on Yelp about this place. I'm giving it 2 stars because the food we had was a 4, the beer a 2 and atmosphere a 2 . The place is large but even upon entering it has an atmosphere of being cold and impersonal. This could be because it was Sunday afternoon; not sure. Even the waiter who took our order despite being efficient just seemed like he'd would have preferred to be elsewhere. I had the Robust Porter which was far from robust, it was light and not very flavorful. We ordered 2 appetizers; the beef skewers which were tasty and the chicharrones, which rate 5 stars, were great and could easily be addictive but not good enough that we need to return."}
{"text":"Came for the tacos and beer. In love because of tacos and beer. The flavor combos in their tacos are next level. Seasonal menu means they are doing that extra thing when it comes to the food. Beers are excellent too. I can only speak to the ales, but up there with anyone else in the country. 

Great friendly service. They do beer flights and fill growlers too. I bring all of my out of town guests here. They are winning awards and getting national recognition lately. It's well deserved!!"}
{"text":"Excellent first visit! Went with a large group (10+), everyone found a beer they liked. Various plates ordered, all devoured quickly. The chicharonnes and the cornbread were really tasty. I will go back and try everything eventually, hopefully they can do it all without cilantro!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place today. Quick review?  Kick ass. Everything was awesome. Good beer (the amber and the porter stood out to me) and the food was better than anything you've ever had at a brewery.  The trout tacos? Amazing.  The service was great as well. This is a new favorite spot for me and we will be back for sure...my wife was skeptical driving up, but already begging to go back. Do yourself a favor and drop in."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service,the workers here know their beer. We had a couple of appetizers posole and banana cornbread,both were fresh and tasty. The beer selection isn't overwhelming with just enough choices to zero in on a favorite. I will recommend this place and return for more."}
{"text":"Great craft beers & appetizers!  A lucky first find!  Try the meat sticks & the white bean purée!  Will not disappoint!!  The staff is super knowledgeable & nice!  Will come back my next trip to Phoenix!"}
