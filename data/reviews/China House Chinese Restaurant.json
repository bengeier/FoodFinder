{"text":"This place is THE BOMB!  Started working locally about one month ago and since finding this gem (a co-worker's recommendation)  have eaten here at least twice per week.  Great little family run restaurant with super quality and great prices.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The tasty food, budget friendly, great service, friendly staff and nice place to eat."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this place for a few years now. We love their wonton soup, house special fried rice, Lo-Main, Hunan sauce is great... Delicious Chinese food at a good price. I think their Lunch special is a good deal"}
{"text":"We are travelling and arrived 30 mins before closing. Though I try not to arrive to close to closing time at any restaurant, restaurants usually have no problem staying open while folks finish eating when they've arrived prior to closing.  We ordered a large order of Sweet & Sour Chicken with white rice and two spring rolls. The woman taking our order asked if it were for here or to go? We planned on eating in the restaurant, but knew we wouldn't take long. She told us that they leave at 10pm. Not that they close at 10pm, but that they LEAVE. Ok... We'll make sure to eat fast, I guess. Now, they have the back door open, and one of them is smoking outside, so the stench is coming all the way to the front of the restaurant. Not cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I occasionally order takeout for lunch from China House. It is conveniently located for us and there is adequate parking for the restaurant as well as the businesses surrounding it. The food was ready in the length of time they mentioned on the phone, and this was my first experience picking it up from the restaurant.  As soon as I walked in the door, there was a young girl who instantly asked if she could help me and quickly found our takeout meals and rang up the order. I quickly glanced around the restaurant and I was expecting it to be busier around the the time of day I was there, noontime; however there was only two people dining in. My take on the limited business inside was that they lacked color and decor to add character to the place and that most customers have the same thought as us, purchase and take out.   My go-to Chinese meal is General Tsos with fried rice. I really enjoy the chicken, broccoli, and sauce; however, I am not a fan of the chewy (dried) peppers that typically add some heat to the dish. I am not keen on the egg rolls or the hot and sour soup and will regularly pass them on to my husband. What brings us back is that the prices are very reasonable for lunch and for the amount of food that we receive, usually providing each of us with two meals. I am sure we will continue with our occasional appearance but will unlikely stray from our go-to dish."}
{"text":"Quick and inexpensive, typical 'American' style Chinese place. This is our go-to takeout place in the Wexford area. I love the vegetable lo mein noodles!"}
{"text":"Really love this Chinese food takeout place. Probably one of my favorites in the area. We always get pretty standard fare, crab rangoons, house lo neon, pork fried rice, and General Tso chicken. Everything is always hot and fresh, and tastes really good.   The house lo mein has a bit of everything in it and it is delicious! Overall this is where we typically end up for take out.   There is a small place to eat in here. Also be warned, they will ALWAYS say 15-20 minutes to wait for the food. In general it's never that fast, expect between 30-45 minutes depending on the day."}
{"text":"I guess if you don't like traditional Chinese or prefer to eat \"fast food\"  or \"American\" Chinese, this would be good.    Tried it twice to go but probably won't bother a third.  The fried rice was bland and dry.  And the chicken dish (I think General Tso but may have been something else) we got was tolerable but was lacking in flavor and slightly overcooked.    If nothing else it is very inexpensive and the portion sizes are large.  So if you don't like a lot of flavor or don't mind things being on the overcooked dry side with little spice then this is is the place to go.  Definitely won't starve on a small budget.    But if you are looking for something more tasty and don't mind normal portions or paying a little more for better quality there are several restaurants in the area that do Asian food much better.  A couple are within walking distance."}
{"text":"I love this place !!! Every time their food is good and the service is quick, good for a weeknight ."}
{"text":"The food here alone is worth four stars, but the service during my visit unfortunately took it down to two.   I called in for takeout on a recent trip home after being in the Wexford area and having a craving for Chinese food. I ordered two lunch specials (chicken with broccoli for myself, General Tso's chicken for my boyfriend) and went in to pick them up after the fifteen minute wait given. I walked up to the counter where the woman was already bringing the food to the register, and she asked me if I was picking up. When I said yes, she starting putting the order in the register and said \"So that's General Tso's chicken and beef with broccoli.\"  Hold up: that's either not my order, or my order was taken incorrectly. I looked at her and said \"I ordered chicken with broccoli...\" very politely. I understand mistakes happen and that she might possibly have misunderstood my order over the phone or something, but the fact of the matter is that I did not order BEEF with broccoli when I don't eat beef.   I'm pretty sure I ruined the woman's day when I told her this. She immediately slammed the register, started sighing and rolling her eyes, then stomped over to the cook and another employee to have my food remade. I don't speak Chinese, but it was obvious from the pitch and tone of her voice that she was upset about me. This did not have to be a big deal. All you had to do was smile, say \"I'm sorry about that,\" and remake my food. There was no need to pull an attitude like the one she had - if anything, I should have been the one to have an attitude, but no, I was perfectly fine with them making the necessary change to what I had actually ordered because it wasn't worth making a fuss over.    They had the correct order made in less than five minutes, and after the woman was finished bagging it she set it on the counter, said \"here\" and then walked away. I grabbed the bag, walked out, and I will not return again if I'm in the area. The food is great and the prices are extremely reasonable, but to be treated like that over a mistake that YOU made is completely unacceptable. If you order food from here, I recommend double checking that your order is correct before ending the phone call and going to pick it up."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice friendly family own restaurant . Super cheap and has the quality of a traditional Chinese taste! I recommend the triple delight! Also English service and lots of space to dine in and eat peacefully. The service is extremely fast and huge portions as well!"}
{"text":"Came in to try to the lunch menu. Good portions but not shareable. Hot & sour soup was more like a runny jelly with lots of black pepper rather than a soup. The bourbon chicken was extra sweet. The fried rice was such a let down. It was yellow rice with uncooked onions & a few peas and carrots. Hot & spicy chicken had a nice amount of veggies but not very spicy at all. Overall, not a Chinese place I would come back to if I'm craving a good taste."}
{"text":"I frequently come here for takeout. It is a typical Chinese restaurant with some decent food.  Their prices are extremely reasonable and if you want a big meal you will definitely get it here.    They have a very reasonable priced lunch menu.  If you aren't looking for a huge meal, plan to split whatever you get!  My go to here has been general tso's chicken, but I have also tried szechuan chicken and a few other things when I'm feeling adventurous.  They give you a nice sized portion and the sauce is very on pair with any decent Chinese restaurant.  Their hot and sour soup is acceptable, and you get an egg role as well with the lunch special.    I am a firm believer that Chinese food is for lunch only.  It is not the healthiest thing in the world and if you want something to fill you up, then China House can do that for you at a decent price.  I would not recommend eating in the restaurant since they don't have much going on inside. Overall a good place to get takeout from, and I'll keep coming back for more when I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to China House for a few years now. We used to go to Lucky's but it just wasn't as good as it used to be. China House offers the usual assortment of Chinese food, but the portions are quite large which I love. The lady at the front register (who answers the phone as well) is always quick and prompt, but not in a rude way, just efficient.  I wouldn't say it's 'top of the line' food, but its one of the best in the area and a great amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to Chinese restaurant for take-out. I've tried the other more expensive places in the area (i.e. Jimmy Wan's, etc) and none have yet to compare to the quality of food, especially for the price. What this place lacks in atmosphere, it makes up in portions, quality and value."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Economical. English speaking waiters/service"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, quality Chinese food is hard to find in Pittsburgh. The easiest way to get a remarkably accurate idea of whether a Chinese restaurant is good or not is wonton (and to a lesser degree egg drop soup).  There wonton soup is excellent!  Chicken and broccoli good too!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place which is located in the Pine Shopping center.  That said, the won-ton soup was absolutely horrible, the vegetable brown rice dish was great is one took all the brocholi off it in search of a few other vegetables.  Low prices for sure.  Free tea but boiled forever in a pot with tea bags!  One has to pick the food up from the counter and then bus their own tables.  Not going back."}
{"text":"This is your standard Chinese fare found all over the US. Pretty good for what it is, prepared quickly, and very affordable. Great takeout spot for when you're too lazy to cook."}
