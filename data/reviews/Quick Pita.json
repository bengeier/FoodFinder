{"text":"Can't get much worse than this. Wanted the kefta kabob, overheard some conversation behind the counter saying it was frozen, was told \"we don't have that.\" OK, so I ordered the basic chicken shwarma pita (becuase the plate was priced at around $12, which seemed pretty pricey for this run-down looking place). My chicken didn't come from the usual rotating shawarma stick - nope, it came from a metal bin of pre-cut chicken that was sitting on the grill. I thought 'no big deal' as I've seen other shawarma places do this when they're busy (although these guys weren't). Well the chicken was so dry and burned it was actually crunchy. Not cripsy, but CRUNCHY. And had that burned, charred dried out taste and crumbly texture. Pita they use tastes stale. They charge extra for extra hummus??? To top it all off, tried to pay by credit card, woman couldn't figure out how to produce a copy of the receipt for me, when I asked for the copy she already printed, she tells me \"No, you can't have that. We need that.\" And proceeds to keep fiddling for another few minutes to try and print one. I gave up, took my disgusting shwarama and walked out. Waaaaay too many decent middle eastern restaurants in the city to bother going back here. Stay away."}
{"text":"Starving on my way home from work I kept looking over at Quiznos but it was on the other side of the street so I decided to settle on Quick Pita. 

I have never tried this place before but it usually looks busy so I figured what the hell. The two ladies working behind the counter were friendly and had my chicken shawarma platter done within a few minutes.

Ok so this was pretty dissapointing. The rice pilaf was bland and overdone. The potatoes were cold and tasted as though they had been sitting out the whole day. The garlic sauce had a mushy texture to it. Isn't it supposed to be smooth? The pita bread was stale and cardboard-like...

The tabouli and the chicken itself were actually not bad. Fresh potatoes and rice would've rounded this meal out nicely. Why is it that restaurants always mess up the easy stuff?"}
{"text":"To accommodate picky eaters = one vegetarian, one dairy and egg alergictarian and me - hell I'll eat just about anything (except lam *unnecessary b*, goat cheese and most seafood)- we decided upon Quick Pita. And I have had cravings ever since!

The platter was great! I love chicken.....This chicken was good - not over/under-cooked as others have had! And I loved the different bits of things I had never tried before.....a heaping butt load of parsley with veggies, rice and some brown bits, potatoes and a pita! For around $10... Nice, but I couldn't eat it all! The other diners had some other food that met their restrictive diets and they enjoyed whateva them people who can't eat meat and dairy eat.

One my next dip into Quick pita I just got the chicken shawarma - loved the garlic sauce and the pink pickled turnip! Everything was fresh and tasty.

This evening, once again, it hit me I WANNA SHAWARMA!!!!! I toddled off and got......chicken shawarma......but with fries this time. There was only one gal working and she did a kick arse job! She said there was supposta be another worker but a call of sickness was made so she was alone. She handled all the customers with a smile and did a great job of fulfilling customer requests! 

I don't know why people complain about the price of it....$5 for a dinner that isn't deep fried dog food  is a great deal in Toronto! The platters are less then $15....you canny get that in most restaurants nowadayz!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's quick.  It's got some good hot peppers and pickles.  And there's an Asian woman who seems to be some kind of manager or supervisor, who is kind and on the ball.

But that's the only thing going for it.

Compared to any Chicken Shawarma, Quick Pita employees have been heavily trained to wrap meager toppings into a dry wrap - something that is masked by the wax paper wrapping.  Here's what happens:

There is a woman there (older, possibly Eastern European) who puts about 5 or 6 thin strips of shredded lettuce into the wrap.  So I ask for more.  She adds another 4 or 5, and somehow doesn't understand the meaning of 'more'.  She does the same for the tomato and the onion.  Today I had two pieces of tomato - each of them were the size of a quarter.  So I asked for more.  She added one more piece the size of a loonie.  Absolutely ridiculous.  All of this served with a scowl.

On top of that, she added pieces of chicken that were burned and dry that did nothing for the flavour of the wrap.

I will not return - places like this have far too much competition in the area.  People won't settle for poor service and even poorer presentation."}
{"text":"2 shwarmas for $8.99. I had the chicken shwarma and the S.O. had beef.   Both were fresh, delicious, and packed with garlic sauce, tahini, pickled turnips and salad.

They're pretty dainty as far as shwarmas go. I was still hungry after I devoured mine so you might just want to eat both by yourself. Or maybe I am just a pig. 

And if it matters to you, they take greenbacks. Two Americans walked in asking if they could pay with US dollars. (Typical, isn't it?) I didn't stick around long enough to find out what their exchange rate is, though.

They only have a couple of seats in this tiny take-out joint so you probably want take your food to go.

***ETA: I've been eating their falafels almost weekly for a few months now and they always hit the spot. The falafel is fresh, crisp and not too mealy, and they always take the time to grill the pita exterior so that it's not the raw-flour blanket I get at other places.***"}
{"text":"The food here is nothing special and the prices have been raised by a few dollars. The store claims the prices have been raised by a few cents, but that's not true.

I don't think I'll be coming back here as often as I was. The food is way too overpriced for what it is. However, the service here is still good, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Nice little shawarma place around Yonge and Eglinton area. 

Smiley and friendly faces serving you over the counter!

I am regular here... in the sense, I work nearby and its a quick of option to grab a sandwich, whether fully veg (falafel), chicken or beef.

Overall, always a nice experience...

I love the exotic bottled juices here, which you won't probably find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to this area and I love middle Eastern food so I decided to try this place. When I went in there was one other person and the staff (2 people) seemed busy. They took my order, but didn't start preparing my order. I don't usually mind waiting more than average wait times because sometimes they get busy and we are all human after all. However, after waiting 20 minutes, the older staff asked me if I wanted ketchup twice. At the 2nd time, I told her you asked me that just before and she said, \"I forgot\". When I got my order, I mentioned that I waited for 20 minutes. Her answer was.... \"There's nothing we can do\". She didn't even say sorry for the wait. And what's even more rude is \"If you just be patient\". Ok, do I just have to be patient in a restaurant of this type? The whole business concept is one gets food quickly.  I'll guess I'll have to find another Middle Eastern place. It was down right rude."}
{"text":"I made my yelp account specifically for this restaurant. First of all from outside, it looks good with its flashy lights. However, once inside it's a totally different story. I am in a protein diet, so I ask for beef shawarma meat, to be placed on my tabouli. Everything seems fine, but once the bill is ready, I realize it's the same price as the plate. I ask how can just meet and tabouli be the same price as a plate. I ask for manager which she calls. He tells me policy is Same price doesn't matter  if plate or not. How the hell does that make sense. To make matters worse the beef was all dry and not seasoned good. As for the tabouli it's just cut up parsley and onions and whatever goes on it all dried up in the Container, once you order it they put lemon juice on it. Like come on if I wanted parsley with lemon on top I would make it at home. Will not go there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is god-awful and should be closed down.
Any type if meat is dry and tasteless... Meaning it's been sitting there for days if not weeks!

Total disgust"}
{"text":"Had chicken shawarma sandwich. It was so good, I got another. Haven't tried anything else to comment but I must admit that the shawarma was one of the best I've had in the city."}
{"text":"Below average Shawarma, pre cut meat, small portion of add ons. Some grisly bits of chicken in finished product. Not heated at end of preparation leaves you with an unsatisfactory Shwarma experience. Possibly great when drunk...otherwise avoid."}
{"text":"Ah, Quick Pita. Where do I begin?

The place is tiny and tucked away on Duncan, but that shouldn't stop anyone from visiting at least once. 

It can get crowded, but if you're not in a hurry and want somewhere to sit, there are a few tables, as mentioned by fellow Yelpers.

Unlike the other neighbourhood shawarma/falafel joint, the people here are FRIENDLY, and they SMILE. And if they make a mistake in your order (which happened to me last week, when they accidentally gave my chicken shawarma to a guy who'd ordered a falafel), they will make it up to you, free of charge.

So ... what about the shawarma? Apologies to the Simpsons, but ... it's like having a party in my mouth, where EVERYONE's invited! SO. TASTY. And the price for a lunchtime meal is completely reasonable.

Sure, I've had shawarmas in other places which are just as good, even better. But they're too far away to walk to by foot. 

I first visited here in January, but I've been back a number of times since. And now that the weather is better, I will definitely be making regular visits."}
{"text":"Why the price is so high ? I bought one burrito here for the price of FOUR McDoubles. At list I expected to have x4 bigger burrito. I have received the extreamly small piece of bred with smell-of-meet. It is not good deal.

Ok, maybe they have the better quality of ingredients ? Absolutely not ! Meet was cold, salad was tainted, service non-pleased, and the room is dusty.

Overpriced food with low quality. No value."}
{"text":"Nope!

Cons;

Undercooked falafel balls...no crunch.
Something was super salty.
.50 extra for tabbouleh...really?  It's standard at many places.
Wilted lettuce and the other ingredients looked a bit anemic.
Waxed paper melted into pita due to grilling.

Pros;

Provided seating and calories."}
{"text":"Quick Pita is good for what it's meant to be: a quick place to get something on a pita.

I find their falafel on a pita to be pretty good. Most of their items are reasonably priced. However, some of the food looks as if it lacks freshness; but most of it is relatively fresh. 

The staff working there is always very friendly and efficient.

Overall, to get something to eat that's cheap, fast and pretty tasty; Quick Pita is a good place to go."}
{"text":"It's sad when an employee makes you not want to be a customer anymore.

This is a Quick Pita / Steak and Cheese Factory joint venture. I've ordered things from SaCF through Just-Eat a couple of times, for delivery, and loved it, the food and the service. The last of those times the delivery guy suggested me to order directly with them.

I tried to order it on a Saturday. It was 10 PM and the pamphlet said they were open 'til 11, so I figured out, there should be no problem. A kinda clueless teenage girl took my whole order, confirmed it, confirmed my address, got my credit card info, only to call me back 10 minutes after to tell me that it was too late to order.

You could have checked that before getting my order, but that's fine.

Then today I tried to order again, the same teenage girl took my order but this time she told me they'd send the credit card machine with the delivery guy and I would pay it at the actual delivery. Great! Food gets here, the delivery guy who doesn't speak or understands a word of English tells me to swipe the card - without typing any amount first, what's unusual. An error message appears, he doesn't know what to do. Calls the restaurant and the girl tells me to try some stuff with the machine that didn't work. She tells me that she will call the manager and then call back. \"Should I just stand here in my hallway with the delivery guy?\" \"Yes, please\". What? You know, when I order food it's because I'm kinda hungry... but what do I know.

Ten minutes go by, me and the delivery guy trying to figure out the machine without success... she calls back and instructs me to try some other stuff, all to no avail. She tells me then that she doesn't know what to do. \"Can you figure this out and then come back so I can pay? I'm really hungry, I could use some food\" \"uuhhhmmmm... no sir... you have to pay, we cannot leave\" \"what? How is it my fault that your machine is not working?\" \"it's not your fault, but it's not my fault either\" - ???

At this point I was 100% fed up, gave the food back to the delivery guy and asked them to get the hell out.

What happened to customer comes first? What would they lose by coming back later? $1.25 (1 litre of gas)? This girl is a genius. Made the business lose two happy customers over the threat of spending $1.25 to compensate for a problem that was caused by them.

I hope the owners of this place read this. Maybe it will prevent damage being done to people that are still interested in being their customers (hint: we're not among them)."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick dinner.

I ordered a chicken shawarma and was quite disappointed. There were many pieces of dry chicken that were as sharp as a broken piece of plastic. I seriously thought that someone was trying to kill me. 

For $6 it was quite thin. Apparently all the ingredients were in there.

There's a first for everything..."}
{"text":"Eating with a vegan when you're a die-hard carnivore can be a feat in itself. Eating with a dead broke vegan when you're a dead broke, die-hard carnivore in Toronto is a feat of biblical proportions. So when we arrived on Friday night hungry and rip-roaring to go. . .  it was quite a feat finding something that both of us wanted. Then we stumbled upon this shop situated in a side road. I had the beef gyro and my friend had the veggie plate with some Falafel. It was delicious and didn't eat up my drink funds. The two men working were so sweet and helpful!! I will be paying this place another visit next time I'm in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Quick Pita is one of those off the main road pita places that offers fresh, delicious pitas.  They open for lunch, but the times I've been here there's been little to no line-up.  They accept debit, but there's a service charge.

The place is pretty small, but there's a few (not many though) chairs and tables for you to sit in.  It's really more of a take out place.  In fact, if you're just grabbing a pita, you could use this as a small meal, or rather a big snack.  They also offer full meal options, all of which look delicious, but I've always stuck to the pitas."}
{"text":"this beats the street meat after hitting the entertainment district.  Located on quiet Duncan St. Quick Pita has been here for years.  They have a lot of specials for those who are running low on cash due to spending it at the clubs lol... 2 shawarmas for $8.99 is a good deal, and it tastes great! keep in mind this place can get packed at the wee morning hours.  Great service, and the place was clean for the area it was in.  SORRY no pictures this time...i was way too hungry after getting aquainted with Kettle One Vodka."}
{"text":"Worst chicken shawarma I've had in Toronto. It was ridiculously small and not very flavourful. So bland. Next time I'll stick with Naz's which is also in the area."}
{"text":"absolute garbage. i asked for a falafel. i was given raw falafel. it was a disgusting experience. falafel should be crispy at the very least. i understand that you can source lebanese ingredients but at least fry them until crispy!!"}
{"text":"Had chicken shawarma plate. The food here sucks and the quality is horrible. The chicken is overly done, there is more skin than meat, potatoes are over-cooked. I will never eat here again...."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice.  I got a chicken shawarma.  It was really good but a little light on the chicken...I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. 

Quick slap-together anything goes shawarma by way of the lousiest service. 

A 'lady' (using the term loosely) made my sandwich with everything in it when I was in the back of a line (four people ahead of me)... By the time I was in front of her, I had to tell her what to remove and never mind the white pita I would overlook. She looked thoroughly inconvenienced. The irony. 

Get this- You have to pay extra for tabouli and hummus (huh?!). The staff argued that this is normal (righhht)

Plus- Fee for use of debit. Again. Same refrain: \"they do that next door too\"-OK, so I WON'T be back here OR wherever 'next door' is.

Best part- the staff insults you to your face in Arabic. A few summers in Tunis have given me enough working knowledge of Arabic to know when someone is throwing racist slurs at both me (African gal) and the guy ahead of me (south-Asian customer).

I'll happily turn the other cheap for a good shawarma but didn't even get that. It es terrible.

Never again. 
 
I RECOMMEND- walking past this dump. Nothing to see here. Head over to FIT FOR LIFE half a block closer to yeg intersection (50 eglinton east)

EXTRA TIP- FIT FOR LIFE has more sandwich styles and combos AND a healthy salad bar. Better ingredients, better service, no silly extra fees or racism on the side."}
{"text":"Quick Pita is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shawarma spot on Duncan just south of Queen Street West. It's pretty cramped inside with a pile of tall stools in the corner (and strangely, one lone stool bolted down), so you'll probably want to take your pita to go. It's got your standard shawarma offerings: chicken, beef, and falafel. They also have a massively stocked drink fridge. Seriously, there is stuff in here I have never heard of.

The pitas here are fine, but nothing exemplary and pretty light-weight compared to other options in the city. I was pretty hungry an hour after having a chicken shawarma from this place. Not a bad place for a snack, but my quest for Toronto's best shawarma rages on.

Obligatory Title Pun: The BREAD falls a little FLAT.

Menu Readability: Whatever.

Need to mention: They take debit with a $0.50 charge, but there is the world's smallest ATM out front.

What this place teaches me about myself: If I was a Sierra Online game I'd be ShawarmaQuest III."}
