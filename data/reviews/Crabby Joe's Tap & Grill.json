{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal with my son. The food was served fast, hot and delicious. The waitress, Lesley W was super nice. They even charged my cell phones for me. Very happy with the service."}
{"text":"I come here often on date night with my husband and the fish and chips are amazing.  He usually gets the ribs and is a HUGE fan. However, the place is LOUD. They have live bands at times when you wouldn't expect and that makes this not an ideal place if you're expecting an intimate evening. Service is usually really good, staff is friendly and intuitive."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Probably only best to go here for their Tuesday 39 cent wings special."}
{"text":"I would give this place less than a star if this app would let me. Service was crap, the bathrooms were a death trap and the bartender/server had to be asked 5 times for a glass of water. Don't bother with this place. Go to McDonalds or anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was there for the World Cup finals and had a great time. I sat at the bar and found the staff very friendly. I also ended up chatting with some of the regulars and it was a very friendly vibe even though we were supporting different teams.  I had a lot of beer and their bruschetta was awesome. It is served on a flat bread with tons of feta. I added a few drops of Tabasco just to spice things up a bit.  I also had their wings which were quite nice.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was staying at a hotel nearby, and this was one of the few dining options within walking distance.   We should have expanded our search radius.  This place was bad. Food, drinks, service... everything. After a long day of driving, several of us felt like having a pasta dish (more of a meal, rather than a sandwich or ribs or the like), and while we all had only modest expectations, they still didn't come close to meeting them.   The service was awkward and amateurish - our primary waitress seemed to struggle with my perfectly neutral American accent (wtf?), and the server who helped bring some of the plates to our table loudly announced twice she didn't know what any of the dishes were. Really nice.  Because none of us got sick and the prices weren't too bad, I'm going to be generous and give 2 stars. However, make no mistake, if ever again in the area I would never return here."}
{"text":"I personally felt the service was horrible, our waiter barely came to see us after being seated, our food took a really long time to come and on top of that the food wasn't  even that great. We had empty drinks for a good while till she came back, and even then we had to ask and wait anouther 10-15 minutes for drinks. I liked the drink menu but aside from that nothing too great. I have been here on a couple occasions for casual meet ups with friends or birthday dinners and I have never left feeling that satisfied."}
{"text":"Strives to be mediocre but doesn't quite make it. Nothing memorable here. Intenta ser mediocre pero queda corto. Nada memorable aquí. Quizer ser mediocre mas naõ chega."}
{"text":"Bad service.. had to sit outside in the heat with very little shade and we had to move everything our selfs. Took 20 mins to get drinks..."}
{"text":"Took wife and kids there had steak and wings for myself. Love it. Wife had shrimp scampi also tried hers too and that was also great. A bit too spicy for my 9 yrs old son. My daughter had kids pasta. We all love it and had left over doggy bag for breakfast. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"If I could not give this place a star I would.   The food was really bad we had to send the burnt food back and then it came out burnt again   The manager could have came out and checked it himself but he or she was no where to be seen.  Drinks were not replaced   I would never come here again.  Stay away"}
{"text":"I met some friends for casual dinner with friends I haven't seen in quite some time.  The restaurant upon arrival was quite busy and bustling which was calmed my mini nervousness when trying a new place...especially a bar/grill type (they all seem the same).  Because my partner and I were late meeting our friends we quickly ordered from the featured menu.  This day happened to be chicken wings/finger day.  My partner and I were impressed by the deals on the featured menu and were content with our choices.  We both ordered the Loaded Fries as apps which were awesome.  It's basically piled fries with bacon cheese and sour cream, but so satisfying.  I must admit, I filled up on the fries by the time my chicken wing/finger platter came out i was full.  So I sat back and enjoyed my company.  The chicken wings/fingers were bland (i ordered them BBQ Hot) they were not \"Hot\" by any standard, maybe medium at best.  I know bar/grill franchise restaurants hot=medium, medium=mild which is why I got hot.  The fries were ok, better with the cheese and bacon.    The wait staff was very nice and attentive.  She came around frequently to see how we were doing.  When I asked to pack up my BARELY untouched food to take home, she told me that I WASN'T ALLOWED TO.  My partner conceded to the rule and gave up his wings without asking any questions.  But I on the other hand was confused since I had 80% of food left and it would be a complete waste, albeit not the greatest meal, but worthy for work the next day.  I asked for the manager and without word for word encounter I will summarize.    So because my partner and I ordered from this featured menu, the fine prints states you are not able to take home any left overs.  I totally understand if we were at a buffet or an AYCE type of eatery, but there was no \"refilling/replenishing/get more of\" of anything...it was MY entree.  To throw it out seems more spiteful than enforcing a rule that encourages either gluttony or waste.  The manager explained that this rule is set by corporate and she would be in a lotta trouble if she let me leave the place with my food that I had bought.  I did imply that it was my first time and planned to write a review on my first experience...she let have my food....this time.  Im all about following restaurant policy...minimum of $10 dollars, no outside food or drink, paying for food that was not eaten (sushi reference) those we already expect when going out to eat.  3 out of the 4 people that night ordered from this featured menu and we did not see the fine print (of course we didn't its fine print) but as a courtesy and so that we are all on the same page a verbal reminder might be helpful.  The food was a steal that knowing the rule before hand would be fair.  I did appreciate the service and the atmosphere, it was clean and vibrant.  The Loaded Fries are a good app to share and yummy!  I'm happy that management heard my concern with much sincerity and let me have my food.  I MIGHT go back...with my younger nieces or people from out of town that might enjoy that TGIF type of feel.  I'll be sure to read the fine print."}
{"text":"I give 1 star because I love martini Fridays, but the rest is because the service is terrible. Shouldn't have to wait 10 mins or more for a drink that is drank in seconds."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday with a friend because she said the burgers here are good. Therefore, we both got a burger, I the The Big Joe and her the Bacon & Cheddar. The Big Joe comes with two patties, two slices of cheddar, two slices of bacon, and two onion rings with BBQ sauce served on an Asiago bun. Yes, this was a little ambitious, but I liked the combination of what came on this one in particular. It was difficult to eat, I had to take the onion rings off to make it work, but it tasted pretty good. I also substituted my fries for onion rings and a side of Chipotle sauce, both were really good together. I only ended up eating half the burger because it was so filling so I got to enjoy it again the next day. Because this place is not too far out of the way, I would like to go back sometime and try something else so I can see how other menu items compare."}
{"text":"Awesome food options, decent beer choices and great service. Iv never tried crabby Joe's because I figured it was just another chain restaurant, but this place makes great food. If it is all pre-made, it doesn't taste that way. I got the flat bread and my friend got the classic burger. You could tell a little skill and integrity went into making them. Also, if you're looking for a place to watch the leafs game, this is the place. It has memorabilia everywhere and half price pints during games."}
{"text":"This restaurant has closed down it is being made into Chucks Roadhouse I live right near it"}
{"text":"Customer service training is needed!!!! Food was extremely slow to come out. Didn't taste so great and wasn't hot!! Below average. I wouldn't pay for this again. The place looks decent inside but I don't plan To go back"}
{"text":"Ummm....yeah. So, it's getting 2 stars because the server was good or I'd be giving it 1.   Nothing arrived at the same time, a personal pet peeve of mine. It was pretty busy, but we seemed to wait forever for the food...one..plate...at...a...time. Had to send the poutine back because there was a hair in it, which they replaced. The wings were very overcooked, practically dried out. Those were also replaced.  They even ran out of sangria flavours. When it's the special, you should probably expect it to be popular.  I probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing food !!! Every night after 9pm they have half price appetizers and they're all delicious. Service can be a bit slow but if you don't mind waiting then it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Crabby Joe's? More like Crappy Joe's. Ooo yeah, I went there.  In all seriousness, I've been to Crabman's a few times already, and every time I always feel underwhelmed when I leave. The last time in particular, where the flies were so bad in the dining room, that I actually wanted to leave because it was so annoying.  The place itself is nice on the inside. Nice and roomey, with a decent bar area as well. Think Jack Astor's, only if they had a psychotic break, and started taking everything way too seriously.  I've never had a complaint with the servers. They've always been very nice and helpful.  The food itself was always really bland. I don't know, maybe it's because it's a little pricey, but I never really feel like the results really justify the bill.  Located in an area where you can always get better food for less with Sonny's, Burrito Boys, or even Denny's and Boston Pizza a little farther up Queen...I hope the Crabster steps his game up."}
{"text":"I have been to other crabby Joe locations (in Hamilton) and this was by far the worst.   The waitress sounded like she didn't want to be there and hated her job. I ordered the Tuesday wings special and when the food finally arrived, the wings were fairly small and didn't have much meat on them - very disappointing.   When we needed the waitress halfway through our meal for water, we had to wait 5 to 10 minutes for her to finally look at our table or walk beside. This was completely unacceptable and was reflected in my tip.   Overall, I will not recommended this location to a friend and unlikely I will go back to this location."}
{"text":"Went to Crabby Joes after a little shopping at Walmart. Had a massive mug of domestic beer for 6.99 a good value over a regular pint and a plate of gourmet onion rings. Was very happy with the onion rings as they were made to order. Service was slow though and some bar patrons are very loud with foul language."}
{"text":"Was here back when the NHL was actually playing hockey and not in meetings. I'm from the states and a hockey fan so I wanted to check out a Leafs game at a local bar to see what the fans were like. Great time and when hockey is back I will be back . Great food I had wings while I was there... great drink specials too. Excepts American Express."}
{"text":"I totally should have read the Yelp Reviews before coming here.... This place is 2 stars at best and it needs a total makeover.  The owner really needs to look at his business and make some drastic improvements when it comes to everything in this place.  Decor is too dark, Servers are on their cell phones instead of tending to customers, and the food takes forever to come out.  I came here on one of those \"Im hungry and just need a place to eat\" moments.  I ordered the chipotle wrap with a salad and my friends ordered a pasta and a burger.  The food took awhile to come out but when it did it was not bad tasting.  However, while we were waiting for our food one their patrons stood up and walked out of the door due to sheer frustration that their server was paying more attention to their cell phones than their customers.  As he was walking oit he yells \"Crabby Joes Sucks!!!!\" which is exactly what the reviews say....  Anyways, Im positive that I will never ever be back here and Im pretty sure this place will not be around long if they do not drastically improve or do a complete restaurant makeover."}
{"text":"This dump is so bad it doesn't deserve any stars. The service was terrible, the food was awful. The only good point about this experience was leaving. NEVER going back to this dive."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Nothing super special. The fully loaded baked potato was awesome. The drinks were really on the mark. Wine selection was okay. Sangria was the bomb. Server didn't know the menu or liquor selection. This place has the bones to be good, but needs work."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since early 2014 and I've never had anything but a good experience. I have never been in the dining room though, only at the bar, and have had a variety of drinks and bar food from the starter menu. The wings are really good, and the beer is fresh and cold. Service is quick and servers friendly and cheerful. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Went back and was not impressed. Got the same special. This time the fries were cold and soggy and three of the six chicken fingers had unchewable bits of connective tissue inside. The soft drinks are over priced but free refills. While eating and hanging out I ended up getting two refills. When my glass was empty after that the server asked if I wanted another, I said I'm ok for now. She said \"Good, I was gonna say that's a lot of pop\". WTF? Don't judge my beverage consumption habits. After we were done eating nobody came to check on the table for 45 minutes. We contemplated getting up and finding the server to pay but she was MIA. The place wasn't anywhere near packed. It's a good thing I apparently over-consumed the soda or I might have died of thirst waiting for her to come back with the bill."}
{"text":"Place is okay  I would put it on the same level as Jack Astor's but a step down as Jack's certainly improved  Have had various things off Crabby Joe's menu  Food can be hit or miss  Service definitely is something to be improved  Agree with post before  Sometimes servers do pass you by without you getting their attention  Again hit or miss but depends on who you get and what kind of food you get"}
{"text":"Noisy.  Slow service, slow getting mediocre terrible food.  Just don't go."}
{"text":"I decided to give it another go. I really wanted to enjoy this place. I kinda liked the chill atmosphere that had a Jack Astor's vibe and it was close to a friend's house, but it just didn't make the mark.  I ordered the Asian Sesame Salad and again, the waitress was amazing. So friendly and great at her job. But the flavors of the salad was sooooo bland. The dressing was weak, there were only 4 mandarins in my salad and the rest was just a bunch of iceberg lettuce and a fillet of grilled chicken on top. Just not worth $15!!! Unfortunately, Wendy's has tastier salads. Ugh. Quite disappointed because I was hoping to find a close resto near my friend's house that we could walk to if we wanted to, but unfortunately, Crabby Joe's is seeming more like Crappy Joe's. Womp Womp."}
{"text":"The food here is not tasty enough for my liking! Both times that I have been here I had to send the food back, (and I'm not THAT picky!). The service was great but the restaurant seemed a little lacking in a way which I can't put my finger on. The atmosphere is very warm and comfortable. Our waitress was helpful and patient. I simply would not recommend this place due to the quality of food. I asked to speak with management to make a couple suggestions. For example, the music is far too loud; I had difficult hearing my dear wife sitting just in front of me. Perhaps the owner could take a course or two to learn how to work with customers. I have a feeling that she doesn't like her job or working with the public. Overall, very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Trust the reviews that your read here about this restaurant. We sat down at a dirty table with dirty and wet menus and all of our menus were either covered in sauce, sticky or had food in the crease. We were situated beside the kitchen and at one point while we waited to order we watched one of the cooks from the line walk out and scratch his ass and walk back into kitchen. I'm not usually a picky person but i expect a certain standard of cleanliness above everything especially when I am paying good money to eat their food. I don't want to feel like what I'm eating is going to make me sick a half hour later. We ended up leaving without ordering because after watching all this I pretty much lost my appetite."}
{"text":"1/2 Price apps after 9pm will keep me coming back.  The restaurant is very clean and has that sporty feel to it, with all the monitors playing Hockey! Okay a little beef before I continue with this review. I hate sports bar places that only play HOCKEY on their screens it's ridiculous, yes I know I live in Canada and this is HOCKEY country but there is other sports besides HOCKEY. Even when it's not HOCKEY season they still have HOCKEY playing on their screens. Come on! you can have HOCKEY on your main big screen that's fine by me but at least have all the other monitors on other sports PLEASE and THANK YOU!  Okay, I've been a regular here for about a year now and one thing I've notice is the decline in their service. When I first came to Crabby the service was off the chain the servers were on top of everything from drinks, got our orders correct and took our orders within 5 minutes. Now it takes over 10 minutes to place our order, another 10 minutes to get drinks, another 10 minutes to get our food and another 5 minutes to get our right orders. It's been very hard lately to come back here b/c this has happened on two occasions, but that doesn't seem to stop people from coming in, the place is packed mainly b/c UofT campus is right around the corner and there are a lot of students that are here.   I have to be honest if it wasn't for the cheap food I probably wouldn't come here. The wings are average nothing compared to other wing places, although I do love their lemon herb and Cajun wings and it's 39 cent wings every Tuesday so take advantage. The big reason I come here is the 1/2 price apps I am a huge fan of their apps. Each app is roughly $5 or under If you don't know what to get off the bat heres what I suggest. On your own I would get the Buffalo Quesadilla something about that buffalo sauce makes them so good and if someone asks to try one tell them to get their own b/c they're that good. Something to share would be The Loaded Cheese fries or the crabby combo. I would suggest the crabby combo first b/c it gives you a variety of what apps that are available.   Items to definitely get  -1/2 price apps -Buffalo Quesadilla -Calamari -Loaded Cheese Fries -Crabby Combo -Garlic Cheese Bread"}
{"text":"Not the best place but totally worth it on Tuesdays for the 39c wings. Go after 9pm for the half price appetizers as well and you are in for a TOTAL deal.   I will say though, that their wings are not the best. I didn't find it all that bad but then again, I am not a wing connoisseur. My boyfriend, though, knows wings (because he orders them everywhere... almost) and he didn't like them at all. Apparently the BBQ wings didn't taste like BBQ. The honey garlic was a disappointment too. However, we ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and that thing was DELISH.   Drinks? I ordered a frozen margarita. The waitress got me a strawberry one. I asked her to get me a traditional one instead and she did so without a fuss. That was nice of her. To think about it, she was actually super nice. The frozen margarita was okay.   Probably not going back, to be honest... Just wanted to try it for trying-sake."}
{"text":"Memphis flatbread $11.95 - a great combination of pulled pork, cheese and onion rings. The size is a bit small but the most important part is that it tasted great.   I got it as take-out and the whole experience was excellent. I was told the my meal would be ready in 10 minutes and it really was ready in 10 minutes.   Can't wait to come back so that I can try the beef dip."}
{"text":"Okay so I give it 3.5 stars now because it's not the best but I gotta admit its like a love/hate relationship I got with this place.   The food here is not overly priced, that's what I like about it. The service has gotten better I must say, depending on the waitress that you get. The apps here are good, and so is the food all together. I really like their drinks too. Read the tips for their specials they have here. I haven't had bad service here in a while. So I'll give credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, service was lacking and the food was nothing special. My burger was overdone and the pasta my partner ordered was soggy.  I wouldn't go back, there are much better places to spend your cash then this overpriced, chain restaurant  Update:   Went there for a birthday dinner (This place was chosen by the group...against my wishes)  Ordered the grilled chicken breast and rice.  The chicken wa totally overdone and rubbery, the asparagas was so overdone it was mush and the rice tasted weird.   And all this for 13.99!!  I ordered tea that tasted weird as well, when I looked into the pot, it was really dirty and full of tea grains (my tea bag was fully intact!) most likely left over by the last person that used it....YUCK.  The place was busy, not sure why,unless everyone in Pickering is lacking eyes and tastebuds??????"}
{"text":"Food takes soooo damn long. Went here on a friday night and it wasnt even busy. It was actually dead. The food that we ordered were just appetizers and took more than 90mins to actually get served. Twice that happened. I have a feeling they will close soon.. Permanently."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my colleagues today.  I hadn't been to a Crabby Joe's in years.  The service was good ... our server was very attentive.  I ordered the baked chicken parm (lunch size) and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed when I stopped by here on a Friday night.. First of all waited FOREVER just to be seated. When we finally sat down took us about 15-20 mins for someone to take our drink order.  Then when my drink finally came it had a hair frozen into the ice cube! I was disgusted, so I had brought this to our servers attention.. They replaced the drink but yet still charged me for it. Food was okay, nothing special.. After my experience here that night I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Waitress' were very friendly and service was great. We all enjoyed our meals and prices were reasonable. All around good experience"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a group of friends. I only had a salad and it was good, that is why the 2 stars. However the time of payment was very confusing for the two waiters that were in our table. My husband wanted to pay for my meal however he sat at the other end of the table , because of that they didn't want to make only 1 bill as it was not his side of the table. This was very simple to figure out however you refuse to do only 1 bill"}
{"text":"Usually go here on Tuesdays for the wings and beer specials with family.  The atmosphere is awesome whether there is a game on or not. Its calm and cozy. The servers are friendly and nice to talk to.   The wings are awesome. I recommend having a mix of the cajun+honey garlic. As I write this, I am thinking about heading over there to order some to go... They are really good. Sweet potato fries are good, Caesar salad too.   Highly recommend this place. I love it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for dinner  and also drinks/dessert.  The service is good but the bartender doesn't always make drinks properly.    Food is nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, and I can def. say I wasn't impressed. This place is more of a game night/drinks type of place, compared to a dinner place.  The service was good, our waitress checked up on us here and there, and she was really nice. The vibe of this restaurant was also really good.   However, the food was.. horrible. I got the cheddar on cheddar burger w/ sweet potato fries, and my boyfriend got steak w/ fries and veges. We both felt like our food had no taste whatsoever, literally. The only thing we both liked were the reg. fries and the sweet potato fries, and believe me I had better if that's even possible..   Wouldn't come back here unless it's game night and I'm just coming for drinks."}
{"text":"Every time I passed by this place I always thought it was a crab place.    When you check the menu there's crab item at all lol.  I did order the avocado and beer salad which wasn't too bad but my niece wasn't too happy with her fish and chips.    Might come back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Tonight, (a Sunday) my girlfriend and I arrived at around 530pm. We were met by a server,  standing immediately in front of us (there is no real entry way). After peering over her shoulder,  she returned to her phone call without saying a word. Two other servers past in front of us, with both not giving a single greeting. Eventually the manager approached us and asked if we were waiting to be seated still.  The manager seated us at a booth beside the entrance to the kitchen and informed us our server would be with us shortly.  I'm not sure what shortly means to everyone,  but 25 minutes without a single server speaking to us AFTER we had been seated is not shortly in my book.    The reason I specified as to where we were seated is that during that time, is that we were continually being passed by servers, all avoiding our gaze, nor informing us that they were even out server.   At about the 30 minute mark, my girlfriend and I had enough and decided to leave. I spoke to the manager on the way out and explain just about exactly what I have here. He attempted to convince us to stay but frankly whatever server we should have been assigned would not be happy to be spoken to by her, or his, boss about forgetting us. And I've seen the movie WAITING, so I'm not running the risk of having a pissed off server.   So my recommendation : AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Should be a great place; very good location at a busy intersection.  Inside though it's dark, staff aren't customer focused and there were some \"interesting\" clientele in the bar area.    Lacks character in terms of a vibe, lots of window dressing but usually attitudes like this are from top down.     Staff cell phones get way more attention than customers.   However beer is nice and cold, timely refills.  Not sure about food because I wasn't offered a menu."}
{"text":"A group of my cousins dropped by Crabby Joe's last night at 9 pm and our food didn't come out until 10 pm *subtract a billion stars*. Even the drinks took at least half an hour for it to arrive at our table.  The only good time to go here is after 9 pm because the apps are half off (but you have to buy a drink too). Drinks are $2.89 which is expensive...it's just pop. My sister and I ordered 10 honey and garlic wings, 10 medium wings, and the loaded cheese fries. The wings were dry and the fries were not loaded with cheese. It was loaded more with sour cream instead.  I never go to Crabby Joe's unless my cousins invite me out. Not my kinda place."}
{"text":"Dropped in as a \"plan B\" and was not impressed.  Crabby Joes seemed to be just about average in a sense of food quality, and below average in a sense of service.  That's one combination I find annoying - when waiters are friendly, positive, smiling, talking to you and so on - but completely ignore your needs as a customer.  I really want a server to notice when there are forks or knives missing, or that clients are sitting in front of an empty table and patiently waiting to make an order - especially when there aren't many other customers around.  Other than that, think about Crabby Joe as a second grade Lone Star or Montana's version, and you would be just about right in your expectations."}
{"text":"Came in here with my family on a Sunday night for dinner. We arrived at 7pm, luckily we made reservations as the place was pretty full. Apparently on Sundays kids eat free.   We were seated on the bar side at a high table, that comfortably sat the seven of us. I really enjoyed sitting on the bar side as you got to view right into the open kitchen and watch the production. As well they had several flat screen tvs around the bar playing every possible sports event that was on that evening.  Since there was a bunch of us we ordered a few appetizers to share  Garlic Cheese Bread - Joe's garlic skillet bread loaded with melted mixed cheeses Served in a sizzling skillet, the bread was soft and chewing but what I really liked about the bread was in had cracked black pepper in it that made it spicy  Memphis Flatbread - Tender BBQ pulled pork and mixed cheese topped with crispy onion strings and drizzled with ancho-chipotle sauce The flatbread was really thin and crispy but held up against the ample toppings, I enjoyed the sweet and smoky taste of the meat and added crunch from the fried onion  Buffalo Chicken Flatbread - Crispy buffalo chicken, mixed cheese, tomatoes, green onions, medium sauce and ranch dressing Again ample toppings, loved the crispy chicken, heat from the hot sauce and the balance with the creamy cool ranch dressing  For Entrees the majority of us went with the Chicken & Ribs combo which was actually on a special price for $15. (normally $20.99)  1/4 Chicken & Ribs - Succulent, oven-roasted quarter quarter chicken and a half rack of Joe's legendary pork back ribs I didn't enjoy the chicken part of this meal at all, I just found it tasteless, no signs of being oven roasted as the skin was not crispy or browned at all and the sauce on the chicken was far too sweet for my liking  The ribs however were pretty good, not the best I've ever had but good, the meat was tender fall of the bone and not overly saucy For my side I got a baked potato with sour cream - which was nothing fancy just a simple potato - Since I could see right into the kitchen I saw that the potatoes were actually microwaved instead of baked - not sure if they were baked at some point afterwards?  Overall service was pretty good and the atmosphere of the restaurant was good to watch a game. However I don't think I'll be rushing back here anytime soon"}
