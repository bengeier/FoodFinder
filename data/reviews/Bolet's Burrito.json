{"text":"The veggie burrito here is a staple in my diet. Great place, simple good food and nice people. The student deal is awesome."}
{"text":"Get there early to beat the lunch rush, and take home some awesome. The Buffalo chicken is wonderful and spicy the pork burrito is my favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered off of Foodora and were disappointed to find out that FOUR quesadillas ordered were delivered as burritos instead -- meaning we had no idea what to expect in our burritos."}
{"text":"A good value burrito option.  I've had the fish and chicken and both were good. I still prefer Burrito Boys but you can't argue with the value you get here."}
{"text":"I went to B.B. for the first time last week, and, surprisingly, it was pretty good! Not sure if it was \"the best\" burrito I've ever had, but, i enjoyed it enough that I'll definitely be back! Hits all of the key things; good food, fair price, decent service, and, despite the odd location, very clean bathrooms! (This should be more like 3.5 stars.) If you're in need of a burrito fix, and you're in the St Lawrence Market area, walk a little further East on Front and check out Bolet's!"}
{"text":"Finally a place where you can get an HONEST burrito for $6.00 This place has been open for a few months and I've been there at least 3-4 times. The burrito's are very fresh and are HUGE (like a burrito should be). I've had the beef, chicken and shredded pork burrito and highly recommend them. You simply can't go wrong... The place is a bit off the main street. There is a Raba on the corner and it is on the side of Raba down Sherbourne. (on the corner of Sherbourne and Front ) Try it you'll like it !"}
{"text":"Hmmm, what just happened? I was so sure that I would love this place.  Excited by the prospect of a great burrito (who wouldn't be?), I decided to venture out into the cold in search of Bolet's Burrito. Despite reports that this place is hard to find, it's probably safe to leave your favourite compass and/or sextant at home. The location is right beside Rabba Fine Foods, so you really can't miss it.  We came here for lunch on a Thursday and there was no one in line, so we were able to place our order right away. I wasn't aware of this prior to coming in, but this is really more of a Filipino-Mexican fusion place, so there are some unique options on the menu. I went with the pulled pork burrito, which was only $5 (student special).  The person who took our order was friendly and welcoming and our burritos were ready within minutes. As I unwrapped my burrito, everything looked great: the portion was huge and I was pleased to see that the wrap was well-toasted. After a few bites, however, I realized that most of the filling was lukewarm borderline cold. I also wasn't a big fan of pulled pork in a burrito setting, but it's possible that I couldn't properly enjoy and appreciate the flavours because the food wasn't hot enough. Overall, it was pretty disappointing.   So I don't love this place yet, but I'm willing to try. Based on the high reviews, maybe this was just a one-off. Hopefully I'll have better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Nothing too fancy, just great food. Seems like a family affair which I love supporting."}
{"text":"Im in love with the fish battered burrito and the owners are the most sweetest people, especially their co-workers!  Great prices, friendly environment, very clean/tidy and tasty burritos! Definitely coming back again!  They also take credit now! Amazinggggg!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken burrito is amazing, good price and fresh quality ingredients. A hidden gem just outside the core"}
{"text":"Big portions. Unique flavors like spicy Thai and butter chicken. Fresh ingredients. A bit dirty looking, but I've eaten here many times and never been sick. Really cheap for what you get."}
{"text":"Just finished a large chicken burrito from Bolet's, and I can testify to the freshness of the toppings, as well as the sheer size of the thing.  The staff was extremely friendly, the burrito was put together well (no splitting despite the volume of contents), and was very tasty.  I think my wife's beef edged out my chicken for taste, but they were both quite good.  I've had burritos all over the city, and this is a place I'll be back to.  Great value here.  I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.  Edit: just to update that after a second visit, the pork is a great option here too.  I think the pork is my favourite option here so far."}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about the burritos here is that they are huge. Aside from that, they're nothing special.  I got a beef burrito with everything on it. The beef was tough and it seemed like it had been sitting in a warming tray all day. I ended up picking most of it out, which wasn't a smart idea because I then had to look at it.  In terms of taste, it was pretty bland.  In terms of seating, there are four tables with stools. The interior is nothing special. It's kind of dirty and there are a couple of things hung on the wall.  There are so many good burrito options in this city, and this isn't one of them. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place for a burrito. It is a tiny, you-could-easily-miss-it bare bones place, run by a very nice family. It kind of reminds me of your very first apartment - not shabby-chic; just plain and cheap. The burritos are big, flavourful and excellent value - none is more than $8.00 If you are in the area and only used to big 'chain' burritos, this is a must-try."}
{"text":"Unique burrito place. Really great flavors. Got the steak burrito with all toppings. I was a little skeptical at the quality of the steak... so one star knocked off for that. But overall I would eat there again. Good prices a lot of value for your buck."}
{"text":"Tasty burritos, large portions, cheap prices = Best value in the nieghborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to this place ever since I moved to the neighbourhood. This was a bad idea because I am now hooked. So yummy! Great for something to grab on the way home from work! One of the best burritos I have ever had! Also, the small size burrito is not so much a small as it is gigantic."}
{"text":"Best burritos in the city. I go to this place at least once a week. The staff are friendly and attentive too. Would recommend this place to anyone and have."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. This is definitely our go-to burrito place. Yummy burritos and super friendly service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in the city, and in my opinion best place to grab a bite in the area.  Food is fresh and delicious.  Prices are super affordable, my wallet says I can eat here everyday but my waist line says I need to limit myself to once in a while.  Portions are huge, I have a pretty big appetite and I only order a small.  The one downside, and it's only because of how popular the place has gotten, if you go right at noon it can take a bit to get your food but the food always comes to you hot and fresh.  The staff are friendly and always make sure every burrito is made perfectly.  I also just got their punch card....your 9th burrito is free....this could be dangerous."}
{"text":"I love this little shop. Burrito's are fresh, tasty, and a very good price for value. I also like the fact that you can see into the kitchen, which is very clean!"}
{"text":"Jarritos were good. Can't say the same for my burrito and quesadilla"}
{"text":"This is my favourite burrito place ine city. Huge tasty and cheap. Really nice staff. I usually get the buffalo chicken burrito. Not really an eat in place, although it has a couple of small tables and counter seating. There can be a bit of a lineup at lunch. On the Ritual app so you can always order ahead of time and then just come to pick up! Entrance is just past Rabba (same building but on the side of the building)."}
{"text":"Bolets Burrito looks a bit drab from the outside, but don't let that deter you. For just $10 you get a large burrito stuffed with fresh toppings and your choice of delicious meats including buffalo chicken, pulled pork, steak, fish, shrimp and ground beef.  While I have only tried the (amazing) buffalo chicken, they all look and smell delicious. This small family business serves one of my favourite burritos in the city.   There is also a student deal - $5 for a small burrito which is hard to beat. Add plenty of seating to the mix and you've got a pretty awesome lunch spot that won't break the bank!  The restaurant itself is a little off the beaten path, just walk down Sherbourne past Front street. It's on the west side of Sherbourne just past the Rabba. Trust me, it's worth the effort!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't much to look at, but the veggie burrito was danged tasty. The large version was very filling - I'm still full 3 1/2 hours later.  It seemed that most people were taking out, so what appeared to be too few tables actually worked out. Decor-wise, it's pretty sparse with a couple of sombreros on the walls. You definitely feel like you're at a little independent, not part of a chain.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I'd go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for burrito.  The portions are large and the price is very reasonable.  I've tried the burritos from chipotle and I prefer the taste of the burritos in this place.  The decor isn't the greatest nor is the location, but that's not the reason you're coming here."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped here shortly after arriving in Toronto. I came here because of the Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed in the least. We both got fish burritos, which tasted amazing and she made the fish to order which I loved. She was also extremely nice. My bf is an extremely picky eater and he enjoyed it so that alone made me give this place 5 stars. And to add the cherry on top, the prices are so freaking cheap and the portions sizes are huge and I'm greedy so that's always a plus."}
{"text":"Small Ma and Pa's run burrito joint and they don't disappoint. Have eaten here frequently and beer burrito is tasty. Havd tried a few different combinations that's as good but my favorite is the beer burrito. If you're in the area you gotta try it. Good prices as well when compared to other and bigger joints."}
{"text":"Really yummy burritos, honest homemade taste. One of my favourite burrito joints in the city. I tried their special jerk pork recipe today and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing little underground burrito place. Friendly staff and wicked selection of burritos. Student deals and price is so worth it 100%"}
{"text":"Since I've been here like a dozen times since my previous review figured it was due for an update. This place is amazing. Cheap, huge burritos and kind, quick service. More consistent quality than most places. Decor still not great, but whatever, once you get your food you'll forget all about the weird cactus paintings. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I think I'm missing something here...this place is close to work and it's getting great reviews...so I have tried it...three times and honestly I don't know what the hoopla is about.  The burritos are bland and either need a lot of salt or they're dripping in sauce...either way there's no taste...they ask for your spice level and it doesn't matter what the answer is (I've switched it up each time)...it's always the same amount of heat.  I asked what kind of beans they used... were they fresh or refried....they didn't have a clue.  Nice enough people and service is efficient but that's just not enough of an incentive to come here."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. I found the chicken to be very bland. The burrito bowl was super disappointing. The burritos are a bit better, but nothing amazing. I'd rather go to burrito boyz but there isn't one nearby."}
{"text":"I was past here regularly and have only just stopped in after it was reccomended by the bike guys at Europe bound on front. I had high expectations and they lived up to it. The staff were so friendly. They have a stamp card. Only take debit and cash. I will be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of burritos, but ever since I found this place I'm starting to like burritos again. This place has the best burrito's I've tasted! The location & decor are a bit sloppy but if you do in the staff are very friendly & they provide good service. I always get the Chicken & Pork burrito and they both taste very good & fresh. I suggest everyone go there and give them a try! You will not be disappointed in terms of taste!"}
{"text":"Ordered off here more or less 20 times via Ritual.  Have always been satisfied, slight inconsistencies in days but that just means it's either delicious or REALLY delicious.  Owner/staff are very friendly.  Great lunch value for downtown - large burrito could easily be two meals w/ a side."}
{"text":"Great place! Service is fast, friendly and reasonably priced. I always come here when I want something tasty, filling and cheap."}
{"text":"I had their daily burrito special yesterday: Sweet & Spicy Thai Burrito.  It was only OK.  The ingredients were fresh, except the chicken. The meat had been fried at some point earlier that day and when I ordered the woman working there took the pieces out of the container, marinated them quickly with the Thai sauce and then heated them up. I wish the chicken had not been fried... then the burrito would have been great... :/  On a positive note:  The staff there is just so friendly.  They always greet you with a smile and seem to be happy to see you."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito spots in the downtown area! It's definitely a hidden gem because it's actually a bit challenging to locate at first.   I usually get the buffalo chicken on whole wheat with brown rice and beans. I get everything in it with just a little bit of hot sauce. Give this place a Try!   They also have student discounts!"}
{"text":"Really love this place..  Food is fresh.  Love the shrimp burrito,  a lot of value for the price...  Only place that tops this place the is the original burrito boys on Adelaide..."}
{"text":"I found this place because of Yelp.  I was in the area and hungry and checked out the map on yelp to figure out where to eat, and this place popped up.  Without yelp, I would have never found the place!  The entrance is not at street level so it's not easily seen.  But thank you yelp, this place was great!  Portion was HUGE and price was cheap!  I had the pulled pork burrito, which was tasty, but when I saw the other person who got steak, I should I tried that one."}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood joint to get a burrito that isn't a chain.  With that said, I highly disagree with it being the \"best burrito\" in Toronto, or ever.    It appears to be a small, family-run business run by filipino family.  The decor is functional and practical and the people behind the counter are fun and have a great sense of humour.    What you will get here is sheer size.  While you CAN finish an entire large burrito, you probably SHOULDN'T because you will be slothing around for the rest of the day.  I had half of one and I feel like my heart has elevated a few inches towards my throat.  Speed is average and they call out your number when it is ready.  I have tried both the chicken and pork burrito and I must say that the Pork Burrito is the better of the two.  Both burritos were only lukewarm which was unfortunate.  Overall, a relatively inexpensive way to feed yourself for lunch (you will most probably have leftovers for dinner) but not the tastiest way to feed yourself.    If you're in the St. Lawrence Market area I would recommend getting a burrito at Carnicero's instead.  That is quality stuff!"}
{"text":"It's more a value then quality thing. 8 buck for a massive burrito is nice, I went with pull pork, the pork was tender but there wasn't much of smoke or barbeque favour to it  I would probably end up coming back thou 8 burrito to get one is a bit much but I Cant say I blame them, there food cost must be high for the amount of food they stuff into one  Thou it did surprise me that it looked like two Asian ladies were running a burrito place but that didn't stop them from offering good value food"}
{"text":"Amazing burritos tucked away in an unfortunate location. Prices are also great (I'm a student), definitely a diamond in the rough"}
{"text":"Best burrito place I've been. It's a little bit difficult to find this restaurant since you can't see the  place until you arrive in front of the restaurant.  Most of the burritos are great, but the sweet spicy thai burrito is awesome if you like somewhat sweet and crunchy chicken.  Make sure to order a small size, it'll be enough to fill your hungry stomach."}
{"text":"ive been here two times.  its definately a great spot when your craving carby comfort madness.  the portions are good.  the burrito bowls are yummy.  not sure about the actualy quality of the meat it does taste rather cheap and a tad processed but definately satisfying none the less.  staff could be a little more nice and customer.servicy...in addition the place itself looks like a ghetto hole in the wall.  they could really use a facelift outside and inside."}
{"text":"Was here the other day and didn't really have high expectations, but boy was I pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a small chicken burrito, easy on the cheese and sour cream  (hey.. I gotta watch my figure) and it really hit the spot. The taste was on par with burrito bandidos or burrito boyz.  Even for a small burrito , I was totally stuffed.  I'm really glad that they're open in corktown as it's a block away from where I work. For the $7.10 (taxes in), it will leave you satisfied for an entire afternoon (okay, so I eat a lot!).. even more so if you order a large burrito.  Remember to bring your stretchy pants if you decide to get a burrito from Bolet's burrito!"}
{"text":"Baja Chipotle chicken isn't the greatest,  but amazing burrito,  hot sauce is sooo on point it's firey!   Just the Baja Chipotle chicken isn't my first pick for the meat..  Still stick with buffalo and butter chicken"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworker, on a random recommendation from a friend.  Let me just say, not having had any expectations, I was still completely blown away. We made small talk with the staff and asked for recommendations, which they were happy to give us even while a line was forming behind us, but they still served with smiles on their faces.  I ordered the buffalo chicken burrito and got it in a bowl.  Holy cow. This heaping plate of fried chicken strips with buffalo sauce, on top of the normal fillings for a burrito like lettuce, tomatoes, rice, beans, etc. The entire thing was delicious from start to finish. For less than $10, you get incredibly high value and delicious food, from a family run restaurant.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Great prices, excellent burrito's, you cannot go wrong. We go here for lunches at work all the time, it does get busy for lunch rush but they are still quick to turn it around considering."}
{"text":"I love this place. Buffalo chicken burrito with everything.  Use Ritual and then you don't have to wait.  Family run, too, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall burrito place in the St Lawrence Market area. Seems family owned, and is surprisingly good for the price! Very affordable prices, and they have a student's special for a small beef burrito for $5."}
{"text":"I like this place. You get sooooooooooooooooo much food for 7 bucks AND you can earn a free burrito! The staff is really nice too.  The only thing is, I can't go there too often because its just soo much food.  Oh yeah, and they think I don't notice, but every time my co-workers eat one, they always go missing for 20-30 minutes before the end of the day.  I know they're in the can.  They put A LOT of beans on the burritos.  I highly recommend the spicy buffalo burrito."}
{"text":"Simple decor but amazing food for great value!  I got the 5 dollar student deal and they didn't cheap out on the toppings a massive burrito with flavourful meat!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this burrito place -- but I'm afraid it was only okay.    This place isn't fancy, which I take to be a good sign; the best burritos I've found tend to be at hole in the wall joints.  The price was good, and a large was big enough to split for a decent meal.  We tried the beer chipotle chicken with the works.  The meat was fine, though sweeter than I liked; it's likely that other meats have better and more interesting flavors.  Fillings were generous, but the flavor just wasn't what I was hoping for, based on the stellar reviews.  To be fair, though, I was spoiled by excellent, cheap Mexican burritos during 7 years living in Los Angeles.  I don't know what Toronto standards are for burritos, so Bolet's very likely stacks up to other options in town!"}
{"text":"It's always an amazing feeling when you find a hidden food gem near your school. From the happy workers, to the cheap prices, to the super flavourful burritos; Bolet's Burrito hands down serves up the best Burrito in Toronto and is a great experience as a whole.   Located on Front St. and Lower Sherbourne, it is not extremely easy to find since it is situated at the side of Rabba's. But once you find it, you'll keep coming back wanting to try all their burritos.  Their prices range from 7.50 to 9.25 with tax included, and their portions are huge for its price. A small size is already pretty hefty and can fill up anybody's appetite. Even better if you have a student card, you can buy a small Chicken, Pulled Pork, Veggie, Steak, or their Special burrito for only $5 tax included. No matter what kind of burrito you buy, it'll be filled with fresh veggies and flavourful meats.   Overall, I'd recommend this to all burrito lovers and blows all the other chain restaurants out of the water. *Caution*: If you ask for \"spicy\", it will be FLAMING HOT"}
{"text":"Had a small fish burrito. Pretty good, not overcooked or oily. Burrito was crisp warm and not soggy or overly hard. Also the BBQ pulled pork was juicy and sweet. Large is more than enough for dinner. Will come here again to try out their other flavors."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Large veggie burrito is only 7 dollars -- it's a foot long and weighs like a brick. I've tried the veggie and chicken and both were really, really good. Even though it's a ton of food I don't feel overwhelmed when finishing the whole damn thing.  These burritos are delicious, and a pretty great value. Ingredients are flavourful, fresh, and plentiful. And they have a frequent buyer card, which really takes me back to my teenage years.   Bolet's is a much better option than some of the bigger name burrito places -- for both quality and price. I can't wait to fill up my card!"}
{"text":"Sooooo Gooooood. Did not disappoint. Large portions. Flavourful. Sweetest owners with the brightest smiles. Even though they close at 8:30, and we arrived at 8:20, they were very polite and welcoming. They never made us feel rushed while we dined in well past their closing business hours. (Felt horrible because we didn't realize they closed at 8:30 until we left and I checked their sign for informative purposes since I want to come back next time!)   Buffalo chick was crispy, juicy and the burrito sauce pairings and spicy kick was so yummy!  Fish was very hot and went well with the burrito wrap. Such a good find. Place is clean but decor and location is deceiving compared to the food they served, but for great value, sweet service, and delicious food, well worth it. Neither my boyfriend nor I could finish our burritos because the helpings were so generous!   Bottom line. Big thumbs up and highly recommended. Give this family restaurant a shot because the value is well worth it."}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Saturday after the Market on the reviews of Yelp. Ordered the large Fish Burrito and my pal had the large Beef. Both were big substantial and boring. Seven Lives beats this place hands down. I guess you can't always rely on Yelp to get it right every time."}
{"text":"Friendliest place I've been to so far in my burrito tour of Toronto. They need more seats! The burritos are delicious, i've tried every one. Especially buffalo chicken and the veggie burrito are lovely.   Tip: order a regular - cheaper and same size as large. Also meet the owners! Bolet is a sweet guy"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem in the Old Town/St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood in Toronto. Authentic seasoning in all of the meats. I would definitely recommend the Tequila Chicken whenever it is the special of the day because it's fantastic. I was also blown away by how good pulled pork tasted In a burrito. I do love Burrito Boyz, but when I can I always visit here instead. Definitely one of the best burrito spots in Toronto.   The only con is the location is hard to find if you haven't visited it before. I live a few blocks away and only found it because of Yelp. If you need help finding it, It is tucked just south of the 24Hr Rabba on Lower Sherborne."}
{"text":"Bolet's Burrito location and decor don't lend it much, it's off the sidewalk in a walkway for a Rabba on Sherbourne. But beyond it's unassuming and plainly decorated store, the burrito is something much better.  I can see all the ingredients, and they all look very fresh. The cook takes her time and does everything very well. Good place to go for cheap burrito."}
{"text":"I feel like Arthur Dent trying to get a cup of tea when I order burritos in this town. I end up with something that's almost, but not entirely, unlike a burrito. Bolet's is good, but there's some uncanny valley action going on. It looks like a burrito, but doesn't quite taste like one. That's not to say it's bad; it's actually good, it just doesn't taste quite like I expect it to. Maybe it's the chicken curry or tuna melt burritos that give me this impression, but I will say the pork burrito was good. As for the size, the small is large enough and at less than $8 including soda, it's good value for money."}
{"text":"My ongoing quest to try every burrito in Toronto brought me to Bolet's Burrito on a sunny Friday. I walked in and the place was pretty much empty, so I immediately ordered a small Steak burrito on white with everything in it (\"beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, green peppers, green onions, sautéed onions, jalapenos, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce\").  I received it a few minutes and I'll admit, it's one heck of a fine looking burrito. It's got that irresistible crust from the grill and it was seemingly very well put together.  The first bite was a bit of a red flag - I got a piece of almost cold tomato - but the second and subsequent bites were all perfect. The ingredients were perfectly proportioned and the spice level was insane. (I asked for it extra spicy and I sure got that.)  So why am I giving this three stars instead of four? Towards the end I got a bite of inedible meat, like it was a big chunk of hard fat or gristle or something. I actually had to spit it out into my napkin, which is something I never do. It was unpleasant to say the least.  Anyway, the rest of the burrito was fine, although it did completely start to fall apart towards the end."}
{"text":"One of my favourite burrito places in the city and probably the best value in Toronto as far as burritos go (good portion to price ratio). Great friendly service too! My only complaint is I wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly at lunch time. Their small is big, the large is enormous. Can be a bit of a long line-up if there's a big George Brown crowd, but they get through it fairly fast. I like the fish, pulled pork or adobo chicken burritos. The buffalo seems popular. What else to say - they're solid burritos packed with good ratio of rice, beans, veggies and your chosen filling, all made to order."}
{"text":"This place hidden it's tuck in the way at front / lower sherbourne , behind the supermarket around the corner . I hope more people are able to find this place and try their delicious burrito . I use to bike there everyday for a year and to my surprise I didn't even know this place . I even ask the owner \" is this place new \" they told me they have been there for 5 years now hahahah.   The burritos are come in either small 10\"or large12\" .  It was tasty yet I found it's quite filling with all the beans , rice and all the other fresh toppings , it's plentiful and they don't even charge extra for all the toppings ! The price is student friendly .  They also have choices of quesadillas.   I had the small fish burrito , fired fish and heat up on flat top !  They serve it in a foil paper so it keeps it warm .  The small one is too big for me so I saved half of it for dinner still warm Lol .  What I like the most about it is you could tell that they prepare the food with love and care !  Unlike those big chains they only care volume I assume.  All the ingredients are very fresh they are also so generous with the portions , hard to find a place like this in this neighborhood .  The fish batter could get bit soggy over time and personally I am not fond of beans and fried fish together.  I can't wait to try other things on the menu and I heard the most popular one is buffalo chicken ."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo and my bf the beer Chipotle.  Both were amazing! A little ma and pa store. They are very courteous and service was great! No negatives from me."}
{"text":"Prices are affordable and the service is friendly. Ordered a small spicy sweet Thai  burrito and a chicken burrito. Fresh and super filling and it held together pretty well without it being messy."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow!!!  I have to admit that I was very skeptical in going to get a burrito from this place after being a regular @ Burrito boyz...but I am so glad I did!  Please don't let the appearance of the place fool you as it is very simple looking.  I ordered beer chipotle chicken burrito and damn! *tear*  I'm very glad I chose to make the trip and I cannot wait to try other types!  Salamat!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent affordable place for a lunch. Like most reviewers I agree the portion is pretty big, and is a huge value for the price. (6.29 for the small beef) You'd probably be best off ordering a small, as there really isn't much difference between the small and the large. They have a variety of different proteins you can get. Some of them are out of the ordinary for a burrito like buffalo chicken and pulled pork. I opted to get the beef burrito and I have to say it was surprisingly decent. The one thing that this place has over all the other burrito places is they don't charge extra for gauc. So for me this puts them a slice above the rest... especially since Burrito Boyz has gotten so gross over the years. I'd go to this place over Burrito Boyz in a heart beat. Cheaper, bigger, and less of a hot mess.  The only reason I am giving it a 3 instead of a 4 is because I wouldn't travel to eat there. But if you are in the area... work in the area... great spot for a quick bite. In the end they totally deliver a satisfying lunch at an extremely fair price. I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Soooooo gooooood. When I first walked in, I was a little skeptical. Was afraid I was going to leave with a stomach ache. But boy was I wrong, the burritos were AMAZING. Dare I say this... possibly better than Burrito Boyz. Everything is fresh and made to order. Very well priced. I made the mistake of eating here before my 3 hour lecture, which eventually became a 3 hour nap. (P.S. don't wear super fitted jeans - you're gonna walk out with a burrito baby)"}
{"text":"Best burritos in the city! I used to work in the area and frequently grab a burrito there. I live and work far away from there now but will still make a special trip just to have one of their burritos.   Great prices too!  The staff are also very nice.  I highly recommend the buffalo chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pulled pork for lunch and ate half of it. Half is just right for one sitting for me, saving the other half for later. It is delicious, fresh and flavorful, like real flavor, not just making it up with salt and a lot of sauce. I also thought it held together better than most burritos.  Service was friendly with a homey feel. So happy this is in the neighbourhood bc it's perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"I think this is the best burrito I've had in town.  First of all, this place is a little hard to find.  I work around the corner and had to be shown this place after nearly six months in the area.  Right at Front and Sherbourne, around the corner from the Rabba this place sits in a small, no frills shop.  The service was to be expected in a place like this: no frills, a friendly smile and little chatter aside from taking down the details of your order. There's no need for endless small talk; most of the clientele seem to be in and out on their lunch hour.  I opted for a small shredded pork burrito the first time around, which proved to be incredibly tastey.  Unless you have a massive appetite, I'd suggest going for the small.  For six bucks, you get more than enough burrito to fill you up.  I've since had a chicken and veggie burrito, and have never been disappointed.  This place is great, and a definite standout in an area saturated with delicious lunch time options."}
{"text":"Really good Burrito hidden away in Lower Sherbourne. I really like that they really take the time to grill your burrito so the tortilla will have a crispy skin. I really like their fish burrito and they do ensure the fish is crunchy and crispy before assembling the burrito. The food takes some time to cook so if you are on a rush I would order advance through Ritual. I find this place is better than the bigger chains. I use to live across the street and never heard about this place because their signs are not distinct had I known I would have come here alot more often."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Toronto - and for only $5! I had a small steak burrito and it was enormous. Pretty identical to the burritos you'll get at big fat burrito or burrito boyz. If you have a student card, it's $5. Really nice people working there, too!"}
{"text":"I had the sweet chilli chicken burrito, great bang for your buck if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Just not my cup of tea, I felt like they added way to much sauce in my order and they burned my bread. That made me super sad, I didn't really did not like how it was burnt. Also when I asked for the wifi password, he looked kind of pissed...  I'm probably not coming here ever again."}
{"text":"I use to walk by this place all the time on my way home and never even noticed it as its kind of hidden away. We went in a few months ago and I've been hooked since. The beer chipotle burrito is my favourite. Amazing flavours! The sizes and prices are very generous. The staff is always friendly and speedy as well."}
{"text":"Best burrito in the city.   Buffalo Chicken burrito, extra guacamole. My favorite burrito in Toronto.   The location is a little odd and hidden away, that doesn't matter, the burritos are HUGE and DELICIOUS.   The steak burrito was good but the Buffalo Chicken is amazing. Highly recommended. Definitely good value for the money, their \"large\" burrito is massive, the equivalent of a extra large at Mucho, Quesada, Big Fat Burrito, etc."}
{"text":"If you're coming here expecting a burrito boyz-style burrito you will leave a bit disappointed. I came in here with this mindset and because of this, it didn't live up to my expectations. It is a different kind of burrito. That's not saying its bad. It's a good burrito, they load it with your choice of meat and sauce. It was just missing something.   Service was good but I waited a long time for the burrito (~15 mins at lunch)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because a co-worker wanted to try it. I decided to order the veggie small burrito. I think that they must have mistaken and given me a regular, because it was ginormous. I love most veggie items at places... but this one was underwhelming. None of the flavors stood out... the only thing that I noticed while I was eating it was whenever I got a bite of sweet potato, because it was sweeter than the rest of the burrito. My co-worker said his chicken burrito was good.   I doubt I'd go back, but he said he would...   However, for its size, it was definitely an inexpensive option. Only like $5 for my burrito."}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you are just looking for something to stop the hunger.  Very good price."}
