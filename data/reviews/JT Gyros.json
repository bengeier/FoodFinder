{"text":"I ordered a #1 to go. the meat was tender, tomatoes and onions fresh and crispy and the tzatziki was home made and delicious. pitas were soft with a slight crunch on the outer ring. The staff was friendly. Was fantastic, I'll defiantly be coming back. Update: This place used to be good. Now it has a more manufactured frozen food taste. Management changed and so did the food quality."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not fancy, but a great neighborhood place that's always clean, prices are good, and the staff is always friendly. The gyro pita is tasty and loaded with plenty of meat to fill you up.  Their baklava is awesome too! JT is right around the corner from my father-in-law's place, so I make sure to get my gyro fix every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has good food...it's the meat portions I have an issue with. Ordered through Grub Hub and most of the meal was rice and salad, very little meat and they charge $5.99 for delivery when most places only charge $2.99. Will not be dining here again....too chinchy with meat!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good.  The owners do a good job of keeping the place clean and even recently upgraded the place.  They have a good selection to choose from.  I enjoy the combination plate the most: comes with chicken, steak & gyro meat.  The portion size is big so there's always leftovers.  The jalapeno poppers are excellent.  My favorite is the soup which unexplainably puts a smile on my face.  I have to get my fix at least monthly."}
{"text":"Pretty good neighborhood gyros stand.  Salad and the sandwich are both very good.  The only thing that we haven't liked is the free soup that comes with the combo meals.  It smells pretty bad and doesn't taste any better.  How do you tell someone you don't want the freebie they are including in your meal without hurting their feelings?"}
{"text":"My favorite gyro in the valley.  The meat is the Kronos - same as many, but the pita is slightly toasted and works very well with the sandwich.  It comes with a free little container of the lentil soup - good enough that I will order a full size version on many trips."}
{"text":"I have been coming to JTs off and on for 9 years ... And I while working for various companies I have the ability to travel most of metro Phoenix and surrounding areas... While there are easily some places that come close to the flavor and quality JTs has always put out... None can equal them! ... Travel from Goodyear just to eat here and always leave excited I went!! The number 1 meal... Good old fashion gyro... Cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Hands down the absolute best gyro! I have been to countless Mediterranean restaurants, and not one of them comes close to JT Gyros! Their shawarma is to die for! Amazing chicken gyros! Their tzatziki sauce is by far the best I have ever had! The pita bread at JT Gyros is delectable! Grilled to perfection! Their rice is mouthwatering! Delicious falafel! Scrumptious hummus and baba ganoush! Such tasty soup! Awesome baklava! If you're looking for gluten free their low carb platters are incredible! Any time I go out to eat I always want to go to JT Gyros. Truly the best food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I almost go to this place weekly.  They know our regular order now by my phone area code.  We've never had a bad meal, and the food quality puts to shame every other gyro place we've tried here.  If you go in and they have a bunch of baklava's sitting there grab one because they are fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for gyros! They are made to order the meat is always freshly sliced. It's VERY clean! The baklava is amazing! The staff is very friendly too!"}
{"text":"JT's exceeded my expectations when I ordered the gyro plate the other day. Very generous portions and the plate is nice crispy fries (they know how to operate a deep fryer!!), gyro meat with griddled pita, rice and salad.  Really, this was enough food for two but I couldn't take the leftovers unfortunately.... The pita was just about perfect and the tzatziki was pretty solid as well.  I wouldn't say I was a fan of the salad, as it seemed there was no 'ette' in the vinaigrette (read ALL vinegar) but I'm sure it would be well received by others. I'll visit this shop again and determine whether they knock Chicago Gyros off the my-favorite-gyro-shop throne-and that is a very high standard!"}
{"text":"5 Star Service and delicious Kronos gyro. I have driven by JT Gyro many times. Being on a Mediterranean food kick, I decided to stop to grab a bite. The interior is spacious and nicely designed. The lit menu above the order counter was easy to read. The chef owner was lovely and hospitable. I thoroughly enjoyed my Gyro sandwich with thinly sliced gyro meat that was nicely grilled. The tzatziki sauce was creamy and flavorful. The finely sliced onions and tomatoes were a nice complement. The pita bread was well toasted. It was the perfect ratio of meat to bread to condiments. The lentil soup was hearty and tasty. I will be back to try the falafel next."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek restaurant I've eaten at so far. Service with a while and everything was served very fresh vegetables and all. The place is really clean and I loved my lamb gyros sandwich. Nom nom nom!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday afternoon for lunch. Walked in and knew all we wanted was a Gyro and some fries so easy, didn't even have to look at the menu. I walked up to the counter in the middle of the restaurant and I'm not sure if it's cause I'm short and she didn't see me right away, but the women working the counter didn't say hi or even acknowledge I was there for a couple of minute's I can honestly say I didn't get the warm and fuzzy invite to return soon.   I said Hi and placed my order to go. We sat down at the card looking tables and chairs and waited for our meal to be done. They had a nice flat screen in the corner of the room so we were watching the college football game on TV. About 10 minutes later our meal was handed over.   We walked out and got home to start our lunch. The Gyros had a decent size but the dough was a little tough, and my fries were of the large cut kind. Half of the fries were overdone and half of them were perfect, so I'm not sure if I got a little of two different batches or not??  I bit into my Gyros and the sauce was nice and creamy, and the meat was seasoned OK. I've had better gyro's in town, so I probably will skip coming back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"JT Gyros is a great little shop in a nondescript center that has been struggling to stay alive because of construction.  Actually, I'm glad this place survived because it is one of my favorite neighborhood gyro places.  That says something about the food, because JT Gyros was surrounded by construction tape and closed stores and still people found it.  The center also looks great now that the renovation is complete.   Anyway, about the food: The Vegetarian Plate is my personal favorite and I'm not a vegetarian!  It comes with dolmas (rice stuffed grape leaves), falafel, baba ghanoush, hummus, tomatoes, and a pita bread that is not fried. Sometimes I substitute for the pita used on the gyros because it is so good.  Also, the owner is really nice and he is always there workin' hard- and he always remembers me.  I say go and try this place if only to help support a local business. In a final note, the restaurant is always very clean and tidy.  Update 4/17/08: They had a Dean's list award for cleanliness presented by Channel 5 News the last time I went!"}
{"text":"Today I visited JT Gyros for the second time and decided to write a review for it. I completely agree with a previous reviewer with the place warranting about 2.75 stars. Maybe 2.5. It's not that great. Actually, now that I think about it they're getting a 2 (folds arms and nods).  Yesterday I got the vegetarian plate to go. I'm a big fan of this style of cuisine, with my favourite being Greek Wraps on Bell Rd. I love dolmas, falafels, shawarma, kibbe, tzatziki, hummus, baklava.. you name it I drool over it. And I've had lots of veggo plates from mediterranean places before, decorated with all sorts of dandy unique items like pickled turnips etc. I was quite disappointed with the meal from JT's. To start with, it certainly LOOKED appetizing. All the pieces of the puzzle were there; hummus centrally punctuated with kalamata olives, a nice arrangement of dolmas and falafel (hockey-puck shaped on a bed of lettuce, as opposed to the more traditional shape which always reminds me of the haystacks in Monet's \"End of Summer, Morning\") on a bed of lettuce, surrounded by tomato and cucumber. That's almost where the attractiveness ended, I'm afraid.  From best to worst: the hummus was great, very tasty although they went a little too heavy with the accompanying oil and the topcoat of paprika; the falafels were just okay (didn't taste near as flavorful as the fresh stuff from Greek Wraps - Ryan C got it spot on with the observation that it tasted like out-of-a-box mix); the dolmas were WARMED (I cannot STAND the taste of warm dolmas, especially the ones with meat in them - these didn't have meat, of course) - dolmas MUST be served cold as far as I'm concerned, although I understand that this is very much a personal preference; the lettuce had turned wet and soggy from the dolma juice, the pita bread was sub-par and was almost as tough as shoe leather when it cooled down slightly (I had to growl and wrestle with it to rip off a chunk like a feral animal); and finally.. oh my god, the so-called \"tzatziki\" was absolutely ~disgusting~. It was actually closer to coconut cream than anything else, except less flavorful. OK, imagine mixing 1 part flour with 10 parts skim milk. Or a container of raw Church's Chicken regular batter mix. That's what this stuff was.  I paid almost ten bucks for a meal that left me highly dissatisfied in flavor. I polished the entire thing off apart from the not-even-close-to-tzatziki sauce, which indicated that it wasn't a complete turnoff, but still. Seriously, if my meal didn't have good hummus that I was able to just drown the flavor of the dolmas in I'd be mildly pissed. Won't be coming back. It's entirely worth the trip further down the road to Greek Wraps. Did I mention Greek Wraps yet? That name again: Greek Wraps. As for JT's, it gets this week's steaming dog's egg award. (claps hands twice) (light turns off)"}
{"text":"This great food. Try the chicken shwarma sandwich! Also if you are eating to go phone your order in about 10 minutes it's usually ready. Favorite place to get Greek food."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time but I moved to the other side of town a couple of years ago. I just happened to find myself on this side of town and had to stop to have lunch at one of my old haunts. It's like unwrapping a birthday gift but better because it's not my birthday and it's wrapped in tasty pita bread.   I've never been disappointed with my food here and today is no different. Veggies were fresh and crisp. My kifta was seasoned just right and the rice was just as amazing as I remembered it.   I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The gyros here are pretty good. It's not that expensive. This place is good for lunch. The good things about JT Gyros is that it comes with soup at no extra cost. The place is quiet and there isn't much customers. I wish that this place has more customers because there food is delicious. It's also very clean. This place is great."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros in Phoenix. Only reason not 5 stars is because of the one refill policy. Not a good idea. Also, the sauce cups are too small."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place word of mouth by a stranger when he overheard a conversation about not being happy with a few gyro places. I tried it and that one time was all it took for me to have a favorite Greek food place. The service is also helpful and friendly and they keep the place amazingly clean. I still refer people to this place when taking about an amazing gyro."}
{"text":"Gyros and salad are great, maybe the best in Phoenix. Lady at the counter is super sweet and always so nice to my son when I come in. Atmosphere is relaxed and non-chain feeling, which I love."}
{"text":"Really like this place, have had the basic gyro, low carb 3 meat salad and the shawerma pita. Everything is good every time.  The place is clean, well kept. Service is fast and friendly.  It's a bit of a trek for me to get there but totally worth the trip, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for delivery through GrubHub. The hummus had very little flavor and was very oily and the dolmades are small and also very oily. The delivery time was prompt so that was a plus. Next time I will try somewhere else in the area."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian and you love Greek food beware of Jay's Gyros their vegetarian selection is overpriced and tastes like trash. I understand the name of the place has Gyro's in it so I can't say that their meat selections are bad.  The hummus is tasteless and runny, the dolmas taste like pine sol, and the falafel is bland I just couldn't believe I paid $9 for a dinner I couldn't eat.  I will stick with Greek Patio and Pita Jungle for tasty Greek food.\""}
{"text":"This place has the best Gyros and Pizza Puffs I've ever had.  Their menu is a little pricey and I have to say that I wasn't thrilled seeing the 1 refill note on the soda machine.  Note to: JT Gyros if you read this I would suggest removing the sign from the machine and allow your customers free refills as you will lose customers with this since other places allow free refills."}
{"text":"Came in at 6:50pm. First off I wanted chicken Sharma not an unusual thing to order at a Greek or Israeli or even middle eastern restaurant in general. All they gave is beef Sharma . I wanted to leave but the wife really just wanted to hurry up and eat she was very hungry. So i decided to order the house special #20. It's marinated chicken grilled with onions green pepper with rice salad and pita. I was then informed that they do not have ANY RICE WHATSOEVER. Which ruled out every dinner from the #13 to the #24. The not friendly women's alternative was to offer me extra salad or French fries... no apologies I asked how a place that serves over half there food with rice can possibly be out. She had no answer for other than \" I don't know\" I made a different selection and was again told that she didn't have something needed to make it. I really wanted to leave . But in the interests of trying to a Pease wife I ordered jus a gyro. And a hummus. After 20 freaking minutes we finally got called to the counter to go get our order. 1 my gyro meat was barely warm and actually room temp in some parts. I didn't even see the tomatoes on the hummus being as how they where almost comely white and non ripe. Also they where grainy. Ditto on the mates in the gyros. All in all over the last two years and 4 visits. I. Just flat done with this place. It can just piss off. There's are 3 other gyros middle eastern restaurants that are sooo. Much better. One even just across the street. All I can say is that at least the place was clean thats. It. Period. Of and the pita was warm yay. I can do better in my own kitchen for a fraction of the cost. Oh and the dinning room. American idle was blaring out of the in ceiling speaker system. Do not come here. It's rally just a roll of the dice and at best you will get ok food. The rice was good I remember from before but being as how they currently have none and I'm being served Tha worst quality vegetables I can get . I mean even the olives where bad. I've never given a worse review thanthis. Even my 9 year old so e was picking apart his gyro and coming get that the tomatoes where gross. I know he s a kid they all hate beggies. But he loves them. He eats them green out of the garden raw. So for him to let it fall out of his mouth. This is deorable. I've eaten better food out of a fold packed MRE."}
{"text":"Today was Chicken Veg Soup with the PitaSandwich, which had plenty of flavor, meat, tomatoes, sauce and sliced onions. Then hop skip and jump across the street to the Dog groomers School for another bargain!!! Win Win"}
{"text":"So I could have swore I reviewed this place before.. ahh who knows.   JT's is your average Gyro type place. Everything is good and nothing is terrible.   Todays was just ok. The pita was a little over cooked and crispy on the outside, the ez onions were loaded in there and the sauce was a little boring. The price was good though, the meat was plentiful.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend stopped at this place for lunch we had the gyros meal. The service is excellent very friendly staff. The food was pretty good but I was a little disappointed in the portion size for the amount they were charging. They did play what I am going to assume is Greek music the whole time I was there so if you like that sort of thing This would be a good place for you to try"}
{"text":"The gyro salad is amazing. I love this place.  The gyro.meat is always perfect and greens and other veggies always fresh. The lentil soup is among my favorites in the valley!  It's been about a year since I was here but the remodel is nice and makes the place feel a bit homier than before."}
{"text":"I sometimes order party trays from here and my guests love it.  It's perfect for any occasion.  The food tastes great, the prices are reasonable and they're very friendly.  All my guests have started ordering from here for their parties or gatherings and they love it as well.  Orders are always hot and ready on time."}
{"text":"Stopped in after my off-site company training. Looked at all the reviews and had to give it a try. I had the #24 Gyro on top of Hummus and had then do half Shawarma. It was great! I'm a huge fan of all the Mediterranean food in Long Beach and have had a craving for it since I arrived in Phoenix. You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"At JT Gyros you get plenty of food. Almost too much food but it's excellent. I had the Beef Shawerma plate which comes with a Greek style salad and yellow rice.  It's marinated beef served with pita bread and tzatziki sauce. Also tried the baklava which was delicious. They also had some middle eastern singers on the television which was cool to watch and listen. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"I've read the other reviews and I wonder if I just got lucky.  I happened by this place today, first time in.  I ordered the #13 (I think)-Gyro plate to go.  Got home and everything was perfectly delicious.  Large portion, cooked evenly, delicate, fluffy rice, warm pita, perfectly dressed salad and I got some kind of little soup, too.  I could only eat half and I'm giving the rest to my hubby for dinner.  Several folks mentioned customer service...well it's obvious the people running the place are from another culture.  Maybe they don't do overly demonstrative, bubbly service, but the woman who helped me was immediately present, efficient and pleasant.  The baklava was outstanding and the restaurant was extremely clean.  Very loud Arabic music playing but what did I care...I was taking mine to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food.   Try thre gyro, one of the best I've ever had.  Place is waist and clean.   The staff polite curtuius."}
{"text":"Had no idea they were closing in 30 mins until as we were leaving we were their last costumers.. They were absolutely wonderful to us .. I got chicken and steak rice salad with a warm pita... amazing. . He split my meat meat portions so I could have both..  I got a small hummus yummm with two extra posts.Very good. the combo plate was really good salad is a nice portion with feta olives and jalapeno, plenty of rice and warm pita, beef gyro chicken.. all very juicey. Not dry... Would recommend this restaurant.  The price was right for my pockets without leaving a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"We have made this restaurant\" our place\".  The food is very good fresh made, flavored perfectly.  The owner,JT, makes sure you are pleased with your order.  It is a yet un discovered eatery with a pleasant casual atmosphere.   We have taken most of our friends there and they have all said it was great food and nice.  No left overs were left. They always take home a box.  Servings are of a healthy size.  I have yet to be able to eat my whole dinner.  I can and have recommended  JT's to anyone wanting good plate filling Greek food that you don't have to wait long for.  Love it!!  Everyone we bring here also raves about the French fries.  They are perfect.  Very crisp on the outside and golden brown, while tender and flavorful on the inside.  We think they are the best in the valley.  Maybe I should not say all this to keep JT's a little known place in order to make sure he always has a table for us.   Carl and Karen Zilkie"}
{"text":"Had Gyros salad was excellent I added extra meat and had left overs...meat was delicious and sauce was great too. I will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"It's that hidden spot on 35th ave. and greenway Rd. NE corner. But dear God this place hit the spot. It aroused all my taste buds when I saw the food my mouth started watering. The taste was amazing I had a Gyros sandwich combo and a Falaffel salad both were very good sized portions and very filling (side note I eat alot). But overall great experience nice staff, met the owner JT he seems pretty cool.  I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who loves authentic Mediterranean food and wants something fair for their wallet as well."}
{"text":"Have always passed by this place and finally decided try it.  I was thinking I made a mistake the particular day I went in because the customer service was very poor and almost unwelcoming.  I felt like I was bothering them just placing an order and was so glad we were getting takeout.  Once we got home, I decided yes, I'd definitely go back again.  The food was delicious and fresh - everything we got was great and the flavors were wonderful."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love the little cup of soup that comes with the gyros. Excellent Greek salad. Authentic!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident one night when I went to Del Taco across the street and they were out of chicken. With my immense chicken craving I decided to go across the street to Popeye's, where I stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant.   I've been going there pretty consistently for about a year now and it's pretty decent food. Typically when the boy and I go he gets the steak kebab plate and I get the chicken kebab plate. It comes to about $20 and we take it home to eat.   Their rice is always delicious, the meat is always cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and served with speed. Their fries are perfectly crunchy and the pita....oh the pita. YUM.  The family that runs the joint are VERY nice. It's a place I'll go back to again and again, and to think...if only Del Taco wasn't out of chicken..."}
{"text":"Tried this little gyro place today and it was pretty good. Didn't hurt that there was a group of hot fire fighters there waiting for their food. I digress. Anyhow cousin had the number one gyro and I had the gyro dinner. Both were good. Son had the chicken nuggets and those were pretty bland, could've made them better at home."}
{"text":"Two days  and two trips to the spinning meat sticks of happiness.    I have to say that I'd already ordered the dolmas  when I sat down to read the reviews and sadly Valerie's take on them isn't too far  from the truth.    Dolmas seem like pakora , within Indian restaurants, in that they nearly all have them ( except  for the insane places that have them only at weekends) but you never quite know what you're going to get.   What I got looked the part,  but  apart  from the citrus smell it was hard to pull any  real taste  out of them.   Out of the 8   5.5  were left.   So  now I'm getting a bit  worried about what's coming out next   but thankfully I didn't need to worry.   The gyro salad was large,  fresh and the  meat was plentiful.  The pita bread  decent and the accompanying sauces within expectations. My partner had the Gryo pita basket and the  damn thing was also good,  decent fries served with it too.      I'm certainly going back based on the strength of the entrees and  without the dolmas  would have been a four"}
{"text":"First off, before I get into the JT review, a big honking one star or two thumbs down or a 'you suck' goes to whoever listed the restaurant profile on here.  The Sunday hours are NOT 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  So I got there too early, which totally f'ed up my karma for the whole day leading to the Cardinals losing.  Okay, rant over.  I had been to JT's once or twice before.  I had decided I was in the mood for gyros for game day and was going to head out around noon.  Then I happened to look at the reviews on yelp and I saw they were open at 9 am on Sundays.  Nice, I figured maybe they opened up for people going out to tailgate (note:  It's amazing how many sub shops on the way to the stadium DON'T open early on game day for people wanting to pick something up for a tailgate).   Anywho, I got there around 11:40, they were closed, tried to go to Mr. Gyro's at 35th/Bell but they are closed on Sunday's, and ultimately went back to JT's, since I didn't know if Chicago Gyro's was open on Sunday.    Rolled in right at 12:00, and my order was taken quickly.  Filled my cup with some wild cherry pepsi (kind of flat) and sat down to watch some football while my order was being prepared.  Unfortunately, I couldn't do this, because for some reason the TV was showing some comedy central...or should I say 'comedy'...   Anyways, my order came up and I headed home.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the to go box was that they must have been using the fries from last night.  I mean, they were kind of hot, but generally they weren't crisp.  I would expect the first batch of the day to be pretty good, but these were definitely subpar.  I grabbed the gyro and noticed that the pita had been toasted on the grill and was pretty dark.  This gave it a great flavor and a great crunch!  The gyro meat was great and the tzatziki was quite tasty as well.    If I had only gotten the gyro, I would be debating whether or not to give JT's four or five stars.  But since the soda and the fries kind of suck, I'm giving it 3 stars.  I'm sure I'll be back at some point...I'll just be sure to call ahead to make sure they are open."}
{"text":"JT's is a no frills eatery serving inexpensive Greek food pleasing to the palate. We got here right after hiking so we wanted something healthy-ish for dinner. After looking through the menu I decided on the chicken shawarma salad, half portion.   The salad was a generous size for a half portion, filled with romaine lettuce, small feta crumbles, cucumber, tomato, and a pepperoncini. There was a lot of chicken on top of the salad and it came with a side of tzatziki sauce and lentil soup. The salad was crisp, cool, and all the elements went well together. The chicken was well seasoned and I liked the shawarma spices. The lentil soup was excellent. I could just have that soup for dinner and be satisfied!   There was a slight mix up with one of our orders but it did get somewhat corrected (Ordered a gyro hummus plate, got a chicken hummus plate instead but then we got extra beef as a side).  The owner was very friendly and chatted with us for a little bit.   If you're in the area it's a good choice for Greek food."}
{"text":"JT Gyros is an excellent little greek gyro place. It has a very extensive menu with all the expected dishes, from standard gyros sandwiches (with fries for meals), greek salads (including low carb meat-topped salads), to various meat plates with basmati rice and meals come with small 3 ounce cup of house soup.  Every thing is tasty and their house sauces are good too, including the tzatziki sauce and the house salad dressing (oil-based).  The restaurant is a counter serve-only eatery, so there is no pressure to leave a service tip, though the food often is reason enough to tip them.  Price for the basic gyro and other sandwiches are reasonable. However, prices for the dishes are higher for the same dishes in other comparable restaurants, but the quantity always far larger than most portions at those same comparison places."}
{"text":"Cleanest restaurant in town! JT's Gyros has the freshest and tastiest gyros ! Every item on the menu is De-lish and the Baklava is the absolute best! Definitely an A+ place for great food!"}
{"text":"This place is near my house. I've gone twice before and it's been okay but not great. The second time, I ordered a hummus plate and was very unimpressed with the quality of the hummus. I much prefer the nearby Greek Pita off Thunderbird and the I-17."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered #31. Their salad was amazing. Huge portion, which I wasn't expecting. Friendly service. Will definitely come back to try something different on their menu."}
{"text":"This place was awesome until I came in to order this evening. The cook was mopping the floor in the restroom. He was wearing gloves and he didn't change them out. He washed his hands with the same gloves and started preparing the food. Disgusting. After washing his hands, he was waiting for the order to print until he cleaned his nose. They have an A rating but I am not going to eat here again."}
{"text":"Seriously, better than ANY other gyro place I have ever been.  The meat is the real stuff, not frozen strips heated up.   pitas are hot and slightly toasted.  HERE'S THE UNUSUAL PART :  Absolutely spectacular fries!  If you are like me and hate soggy limp fries, you don't have to worry at JT's.  Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - the way fries are supposed to be.  I usually have to order my fries 'well done' and at other places they are STILL soggy.  Not here.  I have taken two Fry snobs here to see what they thought and they both gave them rave reviews!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here spontaneously because I saw that they served gyros, one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, I did not get very good food or service.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is dull. It was lunchtime and not many were in there. There was no greeting, I just walked to the counter and waited until the woman was there and placed my order. The wait time was also too long compared to other places that serve gyros.  As for the food itself, I almost threw up. I got home and opened up the container to find the pita bread was burnt. I thought I could bare it because I was very hungry, but at the first bite I had to spit the food out and gagged. I brought the food back and the woman didn't even seem surprised that I was returning the food (did she know the food was not cooked right and gave it to me anyway?).   Overall, very bad experience and I will never be going into this restaurant again. I see there a lot of positive reviews, and I only wish I could have had the experience instead. Sorry JTs Gyros, you have lost a customer."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for quick excellent mediterranean food - its not a fancy place - this is a really great neighborhood place - clean with an A rating and simple.   The food is tasty and fresh - and the portions are large - i get the 10 house special which is white meat chopped chicken grilled with fresh onion and bell pepper - its laid over this amazing rice that just is so on point. Comes with salad bread and soup! They also have the best babbaganush in  town!!!   Oh yeah they have gyros ;) but with plates as good as theres thats just a bonus."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and it was Very good! Went the typical route and got a gyros sandwich. And was delicious. Bread was warmed up perfectly! Fries were crisp and crunchy! The way fries should be! Staff was friendly! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place always has good food and good service. We were really sad when Mr. Gyros closed, but we found this place and weren't so sad. It's not usually very busy and its relatively quiet. We've only ever gotten their Veggie plate, so I can't tell you if the meat is good. The veggie plate is amazing though!!!"}
{"text":"Picked up a rental car and headed towards the 101 and got lost.   Ran into JT Gyros, had a nice salad with great meat.   The baklava was absolutely wonderful.  Staff very friendly.   If you are a Pita Jungle Fan this is a good alternative if it is packed and you won't pay the price."}
{"text":"Upgrading to 3.75  JT's menu seems to expand everytime i go; it's quite extensive.  When you get it in sandwich form, they toast their pita bread a little more than other places and I really dig it like this. They always have super fresh bright green leaf lettuce here - not pale, lifeless iceburg.  JT presented my falafel sandwich without sauce so that he could offer a new sauce on the side for me to try.  He described it as a little spicy, but sweet, too, since it was made with mango.  I can't remember the name.  I'll just call it chili-mango sauce. It tasted a little like Taquis"}
{"text":"Warning! Do not order through doordash. ... Ordered, they got it wrong. Corrected the order, they got it wrong again. Called to get money refunded and the people in the restaurant argued and yelled at us and told us they can't put chicken on a Greek salad. Strange!"}
{"text":"I don't claim to know much about gyros, but this is my favorite place to get a regular gyro w/ feta chz.  I've been eating here for a few years, and i've never ordered anything but that.  Tastes good to me, and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"This place was great! The pita wasn't too thin, nor too soggy. It was perfectly crispy. The menu is expansive and has something for everyone."}
{"text":"JT's is your typical gyro joint menu wise, but they're doing it well and keeping it clean.  I've ordered from JT's on about 12 occasions and haven't been disappointed, so I'll just give a quick rundown on the standouts:  Pita - The bread is great and toasted well, buttery and crisp. Tzatziki - Likely they best I've had from a gyro shop. Gryo - Great, fresh produce. Green leaf lettuce, tasty and never limp tomatoes, onions, etc. Kifta Kebab - Fantastic, the best I've had from this category of restaurant in the valley. Rice - The rice is always tasty, it's cooked and seasoned perfectly with a little dash of smoked paprika to finish Fries - Some of the yelp reviewers pan them, others love them; I'm in the love camp.  Always crispy never greasy in my experience. Service - JT is a friendly guy and the one time they made a slight mistake with my order, he corrected it quickly, gave me a discount and comped a drink and some baklava. Cleanliness - this joint is spotless, as proven by their county inspection record.  Skip the Greek Pita, the Pita Jungle and the other chains, the food here is far tastier and more consistent.  This is my second favorite kebab (gyro) joint in the valley."}
{"text":"Great cook on the meat and the fries! Perfect lunch to fill up on. Also love the little side of soup.  A nice surprise even on a hot day.  They gyros are smothered in sauce ... it is not just dribbled on."}
{"text":"After eating at another Gyro place religiously for years, they started to cheap out.  My daughter told us to try this place.  We were pleasantly surprised!   We ordered the Gyro Pita Sandwich and it was loaded with meat! The pita was slightly crispy on the outside and was so flavorful on its own, I ate the whole thing.   They gave us a cup of lentil soup on this cold evening and it was yummy too. (For the record, I have always hated lentil soup)   Hubby was starving and wolfed it down so he ordered another one.  He got another cup of soup, but this time his pita was overcooked and dark.  That changes the flavor of the meal, so he said it was not as good as the first one. But it was still loaded with meat and he was full.   The restaurant is unassuming but clean.  As a matter of fact you could smell the cleanser and the gentleman was cleaning tables as we entered.   Their prices are great and I look forward to going back and trying the shawarmas, the salad and the various plates.  And maybe, just maybe the delish looking baklava!!"}
