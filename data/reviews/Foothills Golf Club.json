{"text":"We went to a wedding here in March.  Let me first say that the wedding, bride, groom were beautiful and it was a great day to celebrate their wedding.   The set up of the alter and chairs was facing the parking lot. Who in their right mind would consider this a romantic setting. Why would this place even consider this an ideal spot as a backdrop. It should have been facing the other direction.  My other gripe was the the wedding coordinator and her staff. Rude and not accommodating. I went to ask for a drink for the mother of the bride who wanted a kaluha and milk. I was told. Sorry. That's not part of the package for this wedding. I said. This is for the mother of the bride. She said sorry. I told her I would pay cash for the drink and she said. We are not set up to take cash. I gave her a blank stare and she said. Fine. I'll give you just one drink. Really. I found it rude.  Then as the bridal party was coming in, i noticed the appetizer were up but the bowl of chips was empty. I asked the same wedding coordinator who was also the bar tender if there were more chips coming out. She said. Sorry that's all the ordered. Really?  A bag of tortilla chips?  The bridal party was out doing photos and did not have any of the appetizers for the cocktail hour. The food was decent at dinner. The tenderloin was cooked nicely. That's about it. If you are doing a wedding here, make sure that all the details are worked out before hand. Where the chairs will be placed, sunset facing, and how the open bar will be set up. Also if you run out of chips, you may have a relative bring an extra bag cause this place won't spare another if you run out. In the end the wedding was great, but really consider another venue and if you can work with someone else rather than the nasty wedding coordinator they have there."}
{"text":"Where do I start... A few year ago this place had great views and pretty decent grounds keeping. Over the last year I have played here 3 times, both in summer and fall. The fairways and the greens were so bad last summer most of the time I was putting on bare ground, zero grass. The fairways had 20 by 20 yard areas that looked the same. I felt like I was playing winter rules in Siberia looking for a piece of grass to hit off.  Now in November when all course have lush, beautiful grass the foothills is still lacking areas. Smaller bare areas than summer but bad enough that you will definitely be affected. The greens are ok but still some bare areas. I will post pictures of all.  Oh yeah, 1 more thing... We booked a 1:12 tee time and have been playing for 2 hours now and have made it to hole 6. The had a 5 some go off in front of our 2 some and said 'we don't mind 5somes.  They are welcome to play here'. So basically what they said there was... Anyone willing to pay for this terrible course is welcome to play and we will not enforce any Rangers. Great.  Never playing here again. Can play any other course in the valley for a few bucks more and will be able to finish in less than 5 hours."}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona in 1997 and at that time, the Foothills was probably in my top 3 golf courses to play at the time and we played LOTS of golf. The grounds were kept pristine and the golfers were treated like gold. I haven't played in a couple of years since my wife and I have had 2 children and have had no time. I'm finally getting out some and decided to try The Foothills with some friends recently.   1) The course is now riddled with dead grass and bad patchy greens. 2) We aren't bad players, yet everything seemed to be \"hurry up to wait\" for the next hole where the next group was waiting to tee off. OVERBOOKING!!  What happened, Foothills? Bad management in the recent past?  So disappointed.......I loved this place.  8(  Now, it's not the worst experience I've had. But I've had much, much better. If they pick up the course conditions, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I played this course on 8/6/2014.  One of the four courses that make up the Foothills Golf Group, I think this course could be a really nice place to play.  Sadly, the fairways were mostly horrible and the greens were very damaged.  It could be bad weather, but I think it's also poor maintenance.  It's sad.  It's a nice layout."}
{"text":"I played Foothills this morning and it was fine. Not spectacular, not crappy, but somewhere in the middle. We had an early tee time, so we were able to beat the heat and the course wasn't too crowded.      I enjoyed the seemingly laid back attitude. All the starter said was, \"The putts break away from the towers, have a good time.\" At the ritzy, uptight courses, the starters or marshals seem to read you the constitution before you can even tee off.      The course was in decent shape. The greens rolled true and there were a few that were two-tiered. The fairways had just been aerated, but I wouldn't knock a course for that. It's maintenance that has to be done. The \"desert\" areas weren't necessarily  desert areas, but spots were ground was cleared and stuff never grew back.      As far as the layout, It was designed by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish, two well-known course designers. The front nine wasn't horribly difficult, while the back was markedly tougher. There was four sets of tees, with the black (or back) tees stretching out to just over 7,000 yards. There were some tough holes with deep, steep-faced, green-side bunkers, but only a few fairway bunkers. Water came into play on four holes, but there were no long carries over the water. All of the par fives were reachable in two, while the par threes were of the shorter variety. One of the nicer aspects of the course was that not too many holes were laid out next to each other, so you don't have to dodge errant shots from golfers playing the neighboring holes. The drawback to this is the course winds through housing developments and the views of the mountains are obscured.     The clubhouse seemed nice with a small bar for drinks and sandwiches. The pro shop was adequate with the necessities but didn't have too much in terms of equipment. To buy clubs and such from a golf course pro-shop isn't the most frugal decision anyways. They did have a clearance rack of shirts at good prices.     Foothills is a course I would play again, as well as recommend to others. While not dazzlingly difficult or breathtakingly scenic, It is a good value, and the atmosphere is an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"I spend the mid to late 80's until the early 2000's playing Papago exclusively until they redid the course and put money into what seemed like lengthening the holes, adding ridiculously placed bunkers and upgrading the cart paths. Now they overcharge and the whole ambience of the old course is gone.  It was then on to Aguila and bouncing around the Valley for years. Last year I got the Gold Card to play the Ahwatukee Foothills courses along with The Duke. Foothills Golf Club last summer was a disaster! It was totally burned out and for the most part unplayable. For the past 2 weeks I have played there again and could not be more impressed. The greens are a hair slow but I imagine that is to keep them green and somewhat moist. The rest of the course is in really good shape and I expect it will only get better as the weather cools down. 8:00 time this Sunday again and looking forward to it. The cart lady is super sweet and the pros Barry and Dan are extremely friendly as well as totally professional What a 180 from last year!"}
{"text":"Played here two weeks ago, severely disappointed in the course. They charge winter rates that are competitive to REAL golf courses. Unbelievable, I think they are trying to kill the course so they can push for more development on the property, otherwise they have someone who has no clue what they are doing. Please fix this course or at least charge way less. The product now has no value for play."}
{"text":"Shame on you...Foothills. What was once an upscale, challenging and fairly well maintained course, is now a pathetic, weed strewn, bare ground covered cow pasture in the desert.   I live in the area and was proud to have the Foothills and Club West in the neighborhood. However, sInce the clubs have been taken over by new ownership, both courses have declined so dramatically, that it is an embarrassment to the area.  I played just two weeks ago after avoiding the course for more than a year due to its' steady decline. I was appalled by how much more ignored the course was. I will not play it again as long as the current ownership is in place.   I now travel 20-25 minutes to play the Raven. An outstanding course with fair rates and good customer service."}
{"text":"Course is greatly improved.  Greens were great...fairways much better than last summer. Great job... the word needs to get out that the course is playable and fun!"}
{"text":"Biggest dog track waste of money golf course in Arizona.  They fool you with a nice clubhouse and mountain scenery but be course itself is beyond awful.  Even in the peak season when grass grows and the weather is great they can't seem to keep the course in even decent shape!!! Dirt and ground under repair all over the fairways and greens!!!  ALL YEAR LONG GARBAGE!!!!  I've played here several times over the last 7 years and it gets consistently worse each time.   Today was the last straw!  I wanted to give it one more chance figuring the weather has been great and we got a ton of rain this year.  Big mistake!!!  Course was in terrible shape as usual.. Worse than ever!!!  Then to cap it off, not only did they overbook as usual, but they let a 5-some with 4 women go out in front of us!!!!   And they were all clearly beginner golfers with no etiquette.  We had to skip a hole to get past them because they wouldn't let us play through.. The other 2 guys in out group went home after 2 1/2 holes it was so bad!!!  Never playing here again!!!!!!  And if you are from out of town or a local I suggest you go anywhere else but here!!!     I didn't even mention that it's overpriced for a garbage course.. Should be $10 not $50.  Get with it Foothills.. You should be embarrassed!!!"}
{"text":"They should change the name to Foothills Wedding Reception Venue of your Dreams (with golf, too!).  When searching for a reception venue, most people are concerned with these things: price, food/drink,  and fun factor.   Price: Foothills was neither the least expensive nor the most expensive venue that we considered. The thing that we appreciated was that their prices are accurate and reasonable, without all of those upcharges. (We toured a venue with an upcharge for regular silverware instead of plastic... no joke.) Considering the quality of food and service the Foothills offers, their prices are a steal. They also have different price points to accommodate your budget.  Food and Drink: Forget the cookie cutter menu and drink options. Foothills is willing and actually WANTS to make food that you WANT TO EAT for your wedding. They have a menu of great options to choose from, but if you don't see an item that you really want, just ask them! We wanted chicken parmesan, they made it for us, no problem! The quality of the food was excellent and our guest were raving about it. We went with an open bar for our reception and Kelli, the wedding planner/food and beverage manager/bartender wowed all of our guests with her friendliness and ability to remember the drink orders of 100 people.  Fun factor: The fun factor for this venue begins the day that you book an appointment to visit. We were expecting a 20 minute appointment with the usual questions and tour.  We left an hour and a half later because we were having so much fun with the wedding coordinators, Kelli and Laurie. They know their business and take care of EVERYTHING. I looked forward to my meetings with them because I knew that there would be no reason to stress or worry. The fun continued on wedding day because I was so confident in their skills that I was able to devote my time to having a blast with my family and friends. People ate, drank, laughed, and danced all night long. They enjoyed the sunset view from the patio during cocktail hour. They enjoyed the food and drink, the dance floor, the attentive staff, the excellent service, and the energy of the room. (Review within a review- Book It's Your Night DJ service. They work closely with Foothills and do a great job.)  I am sad that my wedding day is over, not because I want to re-live the magic of the day, but because I want to hang out with Kelli and Laurie more! If you are searching for a reception venue in this area, stop looking. Book at Foothills."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the people and the views at Foothills. Even though the fairways are sometimes under repair for tricky soil and water conditions, this course is very peaceful."}
{"text":"This used to be a delightful classic desert course with relatively wide fairways rolling hills, great views, fantastic greens, all in pristine condition.  But it is now a mere shell of what it once was. Its condition is  least a notch BELOW the normal municipal course, like Dobson or Ken McDonald, yet with higher green fees.  The putting greens are atrocious - cut long, with tons of sand, and numerous small bare spots.  The old cut holes from at least the last week are clearly visible, and putts noticeably bounce. On longer putts you might as well use a wedge, because you have to take a huge backstroke just to get it  somewhere near the hole. On a couple of lag putts I barely got it halfway there.  Yet the folks in charge there - especially the older \"gentlemen\" - are in denial, insisting that the course is in great shape, acting as if they are presiding over Augusta National."}
{"text":"Great course to play.  Nice fairways, some challenging holes.  Made for a nice morning of golf.  If you are headed into town and want to enjoy a morning or afternoon of golf and not spend a lot this is the course to play."}
{"text":"The course conditions at Foothills Golf Club are awful. Not one area of the course is in what I would call even average condition. Greens are sparse and bumpy, fairways have bare areas and where there is grass, it is clumpy and torn up with divots. Teeing areas are also sparse and full of divots even on par 4 & 5 holes. Looks like there has been no work done on the course for a couple of years. I paid $60 to play and it's not worth half that. There are many courses in the Phoenix area that are in much better shape and about the same price or less. Don't waste your money on this course."}
{"text":"Course was in good shape.  I don't know why this gets such low ratings.  Yes it isn't pristine like a $250 golf course, but it is very playable and well worth the price.  It is a great layout, greens were fine and fairways were good.  I guess if you want everything perfect you ought to play one of the pricey courses in Scottsdale.  I can play here about 8 times for the cost of one of those."}
{"text":"Would have rated a 0 star but could not... Pathetic course conditions... Its April for petes sake... The staff was very rude and inconsiderate... No water at all in ball washers or even the ball washer on the cart... Will not recommend or play this course again..."}
{"text":"I've played the Ahwatukee Foothills a number of times, and recently played with out-of-town visitors on a golf vacation.  They were oohing and ahhing about the many mountain views.  Definitely a course to add to your list  Even though most of the course runs between housing developments, it was designed for the most part to give plenty of space, so you don't feel like your constantly in somebody's backyard.  Desert golf on the edges, but fairly wide green fairways to work with.  A challenging course, but not a back breaker  I've always been able to find some nice deals on golfnow.com, especially last minute"}
{"text":"Went for the Easter Brunch.  Knew $34.95 was a bit pricey but we had 17 people (3 children and one new born) and they accommodated our group.  We had a 12:30 reservation and they were ready for us.  Good so far.  The food was average at best, but ok.  Where things go south is a the couple with the newborn showed up late - around 1:05.  I walked in to the food area and overheard the manager complaining that they had just shown up - like it was some big deal to her.  They advertised the event was open until 2:00.    Then, unbelievably - the manager had her staff break down the room while we were all still eating.  I'd had enough but to boot, heard the same manager complaining about the couple who'd just shown up / again / to one of her employees.  I asked our server for the GM - not the F & B manager, who is obviously quite unprofessional and rude.  Barry, the GM, came out and spoke with me.  He agreed with everything I said and in fact he was the person the F & B manager was first complaining to, so he knew.  While he apologized for her actions and stopped the tear down in progress, the damage was done....and he did nothing to accommodate our group.  Then the F & B manager tried to be all nice to the kids but again, too late - damage done.  Needless to say - average food, high cost and a manager who is insensitive and really unprofessional....this is not the right place to go for holiday brunch."}
{"text":"Well let's see...there really aren't a lot of options when it comes to a brunch, and Foothills doesn't disappoint....too much. ha. Ok...upon entering, I felt like I was entering a low key wedding party. Large round tables (which by the way is perfect w/ kids) and a smile at the door. Felt welcome immediately. Long line of food w/ the usual suspects and one surprising one. Eggs Benedict. Didn't have one myself, but saw many enjoying. Cool Bloody Mary bar too for next to dirt (in price) and cheap($) mimosas. One surprise was no direct-waiter service...which I always thought....at a brunch buffet...why do I need a waiter? Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of people replacing food, and taking care of tables, you're just not bogged down with one server so you can ask anyone for anything.  What's really cool and what will have me going back is the people there. They seem eager and appreciative every person is there. Pretty cool to be around that...especially on a Sunday morning. My only gripe (and it's considered by many to be a high-maintenance one) is I can tell their food is not ...local. I'm huge on supporting local agriculture...but we are talking about a corporate golf course...so for what it is. A- and still has tons of potential.   OH-The golf course...very good. In a residential but very open. Well taken care of. not a lot of water at all and semi-quick greens. sand traps and desert that'll make you look horrible or like an absolute rock star. hahaa....I'm like a +22 and shot an 87."}
{"text":"This is not a golf review!  I came here two weeks ago for a wedding, so my review is based entirely on the wedding.  It was an outdoor wedding in front of the clubhouse.  The way they incorporated their waterfall into the precession was quite nice I will say.  As for the banquet facility it was just OK.  The food was served buffet style and it was god awful.  The staff was quite nice and it was open bar, can't complain about that!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California I was pleasantly surprised by how great Foothills Golf Club actually is!! First time playing golf Arizona was a success. When the boys told me we'd be golfing in Arizona, my immediate sarcastic thought was \"oh good, desert and cactus\" but it's really nice. Sure there are some patches but overall it's green and a well-kept hidden treasure in my opinion. Foothills is better than some of the courses out here in Orange County. Life hack tip: Go in with zero expectations and you'll probably leave happy.   The greens roooooooll and there is no shortness of views. The pricing is affordable. Staff is friendly and helpful.   The only thing that sucked was pace of play. We tee'd off before 3:00pm and were constantly waiting for the groups ahead of us to finish and had the group behind us on our tails the entire round of 18. We finished our round in the dark. Guys, either you need to get better or lose the friend who's holding you back."}
{"text":"I've played Foothills a couple of times.  Not bad at all for the price.  The Foothills has some decent scenery, and it's been in decent shape both times I played.  The layout is nice, with water coming into play on three or four holes.  For the price, it's much better than comparable courses in the East Valley.  You can usually get a spring twilight round or a summer round for a very reasonable rate (~$30?).  The practice facilities aren't the greatest.  The layout is kind of confusing.  The course isn't particularly difficult, although I want to murder the 17th green.  Those bunkers are going to get it next time."}
{"text":"This course is a fun track.  Challenging with houses lining almost every hole.  Well maintained and getting better every time out.  Great views as well and usually not overly crowded.  Nice staff to top it off."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this course gets low ratings. There are some problems with dry patches and the greens need some work. I don't know if that's a condition of the grounds crew or the way the course was designed on the rocky steps of South mountain. Overall pricing isn't bad and the scenery is pretty nice. You can still see Rod Stewart's house!  Give this course a try. You can find some pretty good online deals and I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and service good, but it becomes apparent quite quickly that there may (stress \"MAY\") be some issues with this club.  Either they have run into serious financial problems ....or....they have decided spending money on the course is not good business.  The green fees reflected this.  We paid $44 for 18 holes with a cart during MARCH of 2018.  When everyone else is charging $150-225....this course is 44 bucks ???  The course is steps away from becoming a goat path, with weeds growing in stressed rough/ fairway transition areas.  There are few courses outside muni's in inner cities that I have seen in worse shape. It almost looks like their greenskeeper died and was not replaced.  No greenskeeper alive would allow this on their watch.  Again, I hate to give only 2 stars because staff were very cordial, but the course needs LOTS and LOTS of work.  Also the driving range is atrocious !!  Potential here for a decent course but they really have to start spending money.....lots of it."}
{"text":"My family ate Easter brunch at foothills golf club and we will not be back. We had a table of 17 for 1230p reservations for a brunch that ended at 2pm. The manager on duty was overheard talking about our table not once but twice by a member of our party. The manager was upset that part of our party was late ,and decided to show when ever they wanted.  Sad part, my daughter has a three week old baby and a visitor from out of the country. Yes she was late. Not there business. There were 14 other people. In addition they started breaking down all the tables in the back room where we were sat while we were still eating. It was distracting and noisy.  We spoke to general manager who apologized ,he did have them stop breaking down the tables. The waitress was very sweet and asked if he offered to do anything for us and we said, no he didn't.  Last time!!"}
{"text":"Curran! Sorry had your name wrong. Thanks for your very verbose response. I'm not looking for a free meal or a redo. The opportunity was lost and that's unfortunate."}
{"text":"The staff always strive to make our experience the best that it can be. We have been for a couple of events. It's a beautiful venue."}
{"text":"I am very pleased to have a great brunch spot in the Foothills area! We just went this weekend for the 2nd time, and it will definitely not be our last! I do not eat eggs so sometimes breakfast can get a little boring, but I did not feel that way here. I had plenty of options and my favorite was the biscuits and sausage gravy. I think we have found a lil gem right in the Foothills and once the neighborhood finds out about this it might get too crowded!"}
{"text":"The fairways were very skimpy with many bare spots. Lots of desert rough. Even a ball in the fairway might end up in a bad lie. Even the employee working that day admitted the course was less than adequate. According to my playing partner the course was nice at one time. Don't take a nice set of clubs there. The grass was very thin. I wouldn't recommend this course even if it was less 40 for an am tee time. Very few golfers even at 11 am; apparently the message has gotten out regarding the current course conditions."}
{"text":"Had a DealChicken for the golf course which was an amazing value, came with a round of golf, couple sleeves of Nike balls and lunch for $15, however when we checked in a they had was cheap Strata golf balls that no one wants, requested Nike's like the voucher clearly states and again was told tough. Course was in fair condition, some of the greens had really bad bare patches in them. Also, went to the club house at 4 after we were done and were immediately told we had to leave cause there was a wedding coming in. So much for the 19th hole!"}
{"text":"Course was in amazing shape!  Loved playing it and will be happy to come back and play next time I am in Phx!"}
{"text":"One of the better course at an affordable rates, even the winter rates, its still affordable. Landscape is pretty good mainly due to the course is built on bottom of South Mountain, AZ. Fairways are generous and forgiving. Some holes are surrounded by houses. Greens are typical speed and can be tricky due to the mountain (tip: just make sure you are aware of the mountain and water wrt your putting line) but not PGA fast. Long hitters will have fun on most of the PAR 5s. I would definitely go back for another round. I have taken lots of photos."}
{"text":"Nice clubhouse for a party  I cannot speak to the golf course as I was only at Foothills Golf Club for a party in the clubhouse. Nice enough area. It was night and there are not many streetlights, so be prepared to drive slowly and turn quickly. Also, the layout of the front versus rear lot is a bit confusing-- you'll want to park in the higher lot for clubhouse events.  Clubhouse is fine. Shows some age, but the service staff are nice enough. Food was also good. Not exceptional mind you, but par for what you would expect.  There was great company at the party.  That may be making a positive difference in my rating."}
{"text":"A living social brought me to this course as I like to play different courses all over the valley.  Two stars because of the many issues with this course, which is sad because it has so much potential.  The clubhouse is nice and the foothills area is neat, but that's about where it ends.   The range is only 250 yards long and on the other side of the range there are other golfers hitting back at you so you have to watch out for unfriendly fire.   The greens looked to be suffering from some fungus as there were large areas of many greens that were dead.  Some of the fairways were very wet/soggy to the point that they didn't want you taking the cart out on them.  Probably the best part of the day was the cart girl, and I didn't even get any beers! (but the other guys in my foursome did in case my wife reads this) With so many great courses in the Valley to choose from I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"DOES THE GRASS EVER GET WATERED???????????????  Oh boyyy, after reading the reviews I figured I would still give it a shot...BAD IDEA....Paying 45$ is waaaaaayyyyyyyy too much. the greens are all dried out and so are the fairways. I don't think they know what watering means.   I should have gone elsewhere"}
{"text":"I golf Foothills only about four times a year and it's always the same.  As much as I enjoy the layout of the course and the beautiful views, it is very poorly managed.  They seriously need to space out the t times.  In many years of playing here, I've never had a round under 5 or more hours.  I golfed yesterday with some friends and we waited about 7-10 minutes for each shot.  We saw groups of 5 on the course and no rangers.   I'm done!  No more golf here."}
{"text":"\"Okay here is my thing with this course yes it has issues...yes they are making changes and trying to improve but see it for what it is a true beauty below. Its dirt cheap to play here a very friendly staff fun interesting holes and not crowded.   Lighten up people..."}
