{"text":"Ok. Walked in and was told 45 minutes by one of 4 hostesses. I walked to bar to grab a drink and noticed half the tables were empty on a Friday night. After an hour we just grabbed a tabke at the bar. 


Service to order was extremely slow. Food took forever to come and it was cold. Maybe it sat in the kitchen .. who knows. Most of what we ordered was wrong .. example we ordered buffalo wings and received cold buffalo tenders. 

This is my 3rd attempt and always the same old issues. I wonder why they cant staff the floor? 

This place is horrible and I cant stress enough... dont go here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , very good food. It's just a little over priced. Other than that I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

Has a nice atmosphere.  Try the top shelf long island iced tea!"}

{"text":"I LOVE Houlihans!!! This place is great! I've been here tons of times over the years and I've never been disappointed. 

I recommend the chicken enchiladas, the mushroom enchiladas, the Asian chop salad, the calamari, the meatloaf, any of the Long Island Iced Tea pitchers, the pot roast, stuffed chicken breast, calamari, and especially the Tuscan salad with goat cheese. 

I also like the atmosphere, and (HUGE PLUS) there's almost never a wait at this location (at least the times I've been here!)."}
{"text":"I like Houlihans, when you go there you know your food is going to be good, it is the same way each time.  I like the ahi tuna salad, the french onion soup, the tortilla soup, but most of all the shrooms, which are breaded mushrooms filled with a cheese and horseradish sauce on the side.  They are delicious!  The ahi tuna salad has rare tuna and banana chips with a sauce on it, it all comes together really well.  The buffalo chicken salad taste good also.  Lots of choices!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Kudos to the chef, however our waitress \"Amanda\" was not as outstanding as the salmon. We had accumulated approximately 3 plates, 6 glasses, and and two headaches by the time we received the check....which Amanda awkwardly said she would wait for me to pull out my card to pay. Who does that? Perhaps she could have removed the restaurants stockpile of dishes on our tiny ass table while I retrieved my credit card. Overall food = 9.6 ... waitress = 8% tip."}
{"text":"Honestly not bad for a chain. Some nice small plates, craft beers, decent atmosphere, and great patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Service was great. 
The Ahi Tuna salad was tremendous. 
Food arrived promptly.  


I would most definitely recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I generally avoid the chain restaurants but we have come to like Houlihan's at the Galleria.  It is reasonably quiet and they have cozy booths.  Service has always been prompt and good.  Since we typically go there late evenings, we have no experience during busy times.  My wife requires gluten free and she has been able to find sufficient GF menu items.  She typically orders the sea scallops.  I have had the Southern California Fish Tacos a number of times.  Well, they might not be quite as good as those you can get in San Diego, but they are the best I've found in Pittsburgh.  Most recently, I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad and found it to be a better than average Caesar salad with tasty grilled chicken and the added touch of warm polenta croutons.  We keep going back because we've always had a good experience there."}
{"text":"We have dined here many, many times over the years with family, friends, etc.  We have always been very happy with the service, the atmosphere, the food and the prices.  When we do girls night, we especially like to sit outside when the weather is good.  Although the bar area is smallish, it's has a nice vibe whether it's busy or quiet.    
After the closing our favorite local bar/restaurant (within walking distance of our house) that we visited at least once a week, we decided to go to the bar at Houlihan's until we found another spot.  After one visit (sitting at the bar), we decided we found our new spot--even though it's not within walking distance of our house!  We are typically there on a Thursday night so Andrea and Kurt are usually behind the bar---they are great--friendly, always pleasant and accommodating and good martini makers!  We have also had great service from all of the bartenders when we are there on other evenings.  We also had a great experience with Luke (server) one snowy day when we found ourselves there for lunch with family and then happy hour and dinner with friends!   
Their food is always fresh, well prepared and presented well. The menu is varied enough that everyone can get something they enjoy.   The prices are reasonable too.  Win. Win. Win."}
{"text":"I'm a Houlihan's fan. It's REALLY fast, the service is unfailingly delightful (their wait staff rocks) and the food is consistent. I always order the same thing (grilled chicken sandwich with a cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom on top), so consistency matters to me. I've only ever gone there for lunch, and have always been seated immediately - maybe that's the secret to avoiding the long wait times other reviewers have mentioned. 

While there's nothing particularly flashy or fancy about Houlihan's, I like knowing I can count on a fast, yummy lunch served to me by someone pleasant and helpful. It's my standby."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here. They started the modern restaurant scene in Mt. Lebanon when they moved into the galleria and have kept up since. Fair prices and good food. Steaks are good and veggies have always been fresh as well as mixed drinks.

Recently they did make some updates to the decor and menu which seems a little smaller. It's a big place but walk in on a saturday night put a reservation in and the longest you'll wait is 45 minutes. They have a text notification so you can go walk around the mall while you wait for your table. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place but it use to be pretty good. I went on Sunday with a group of friends only to find out that they were out of most of the food and drinks that they wanted. The food I did order was good, but how can a restaurant be out of so many things. I use to go there all the time, hopefully things will improve."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their food!! The atmosphere is nice and service is generally speedy. Chicken nachos & chicken Alfredo are the dishes to try. Their mashed potatoes are a hit with my friends. It's the place to be."}
{"text":"This place is okay, It has a very \"normal\" selection of beers and other adult beverages. The service is always fast and friendly but this place definitely gets way too overcrowded than what I would expect in an establishment of this quality. If you don't get your name in quick expect to wait at least 20 minutes before you get seated which is not worth it in my opinion. The food is just okay nothing really spectacular but I do like the little plates of food that they offer. MY biggest personal hang up is the menu ranges from the little plates to giant entrees that mostly consist of pastas, steaks etc. And if you want something a little but lighter than an entree but larger than an appetizer you basically have to settle for a sandwich or a burger. I went with a plate of 2 cheddar sliders which where flavorless, dry, and overcooked. I'd go back but not on the top or my list."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times and while it used to be great, lately it's service has really gone down hill.  Food takes forever, is mediocre at best and the staff all act like they hate their jobs and don't want to be bothered.  The one thing that bothers me more than anything is that the kids menu says that all kids meals come with carrots/ranch beforehand and ice cream after.  After eating at other places that do this, like BJs, I would have expected the carrots to come out immediately.  I have 4 kids and after waiting a long time for our table on a sat night that would have been a life saver, however we never saw those carrots and haven't the last 4 times we ate there.  Why on earth should we have to ask for them? Again after we finished  eating I couldn't help but wonder if the waitress was going to ask us if we wanted the ice cream, as my kids knew about that and were expecting it.  Nope, she never offered, I had to ask, and she acted like she couldn't have been more annoyed that she had to get us 4 ice creams.  I'm sorry, but if it's such a pain to do these things don't offer them.  We likely won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Houlihan's is one of these staple restaurants that serve more or less what you expect from a just above average chain.

I've been here a dozen times, and maybe more often when it was on top of the hill near Fort Couch Road.  The service is usually pretty reliable, good and fast.

My wife lives and dies by the Buffalo Bleu salad.

The Rojo Chicken Street tacos were ok --- but missing the sour cream, guac, and salsa from traditional dishes.  While I know they were trying to go \"beyond\" that, I still found myself requesting those ingredients.

The Italian Sausage Flatbread was good, but it was burnt this time.  Normally, it's better.

The chicken nachos were huge and quickly gobbled up by our party of six.

Houlihan's was packed when we were there Saturday night.  I've also sat at the bar several times and the service is friendly and helpful.

The goat cheese and artichoke balls, and buffalo chicken tenders are also very good appetizers.

Overall, while nothing was exciting in this particular culinary cosmos, everything was good.

The prices are a little high on some items, but the food is good consistently, and service quality is high --- they are easily justifiable especially in high-rent district of the Galleria."}
{"text":"Meh... When I used to work near here, I had fond memories of grabbing take out orders of the stuffed mushroom for us to munch on, or convincing friends to hold weekend dinner gatherings here so that I can easily pop down after work. 

But I really don't like Houlihan's beyond its convenience. The food is expensive, and the price is justified by neither the food quality nor quantity, and I've always found the decor a bit dark in here. 

The service is good. They're definitely adequately staffed during the rush hours, and everyone is friendly enough. 

But I still wouldn't come here on my own accord... I just don't think the price is justified by the flavor or portion of the food on the plate. 

The one exception, though, is the potato soup!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I live in the neighborhood so we visit Houlihan's quite often for drinks or a quick meal.  They have good sandwiches, burgers, appetizers and a steak wedge salad that is delicious.  The drinks however are a little more expensive than you would find at other places in the area, but they do have specials from time to time."}
{"text":"I really like this Houlihan's out of the locations I have been to in the Pittsburgh area. I have always had a good experience here.

I recently went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with my mom. We were seated and waited on promptly. Our server was very friendly and very attentive. I ordered the Brentwood Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries and both were really delicious. This sandwich will probably be my go to item when I visit again.

My mom ordered the Organic Power Greens salad which she said was also very good.

The atmosphere was nice and relaxed since it wasn't very busy at the time we were there. I'm sure we will be back again for another lunch date soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided on a quick lunch here the other day. It was during the week, so no wait. We walked in and were greeted promptly and seated. I have to point out though, that the hostess was as far from friendly that they come. She's probably in the wrong business. Anyway...they seated us directly across from another table, so it was almost like we were sitting across from each other on an elevated stage bc they were the side seats which sit up higher. We were pretty much forced to sit side by side because of the oddly shaped table.

So I ordered the mushroom flatbread which came with a soup or salad. I decided on the Tuscan white bean salad. It was white beans with arugula and almost like a salsa/bruschetta and two pieces of toasted bread and a dollop of goat cheese. It was pretty tasty I must say. Not much to it really, but good. Also a healthy option which is nice. We shared the Thai Asian wings and they were PERFECT. Perfect crunch, and perfect flavor. I'll be back for more wings for sure! Our waitress was attentive as well."}
{"text":"This is a chain and I usually can't stand chain restaurants. But the atmosphere makes it not feel like a chain. No televisions playing sports programs. Nice cocktails with a good happy hour. Really great small plates. I recommend the avocado egg rolls, the goat cheese artichoke things, and the lettuce wraps. Don't bother getting a large meal - just get a bunch of apps. You'll be happier!"}
{"text":"I had a friend who worked at this location so I would visit with friends and family all the time for some food.

If you have the unfortunate idea of dining there at night, you'll feel like you're in Abercrombie and Fitch (meaning - you'll need a flashlight to read your menu). The restaurant attempts to be very trendy with it's dim lighting and decor, but it's more annoying than anything. I suppose they don't want you to be able to read the overpriced items when your receipt comes.

There's little to be said - the food is nothing more than average. They have a wide selection of available foods and drinks. 

My main concern with Houlihan's is the treatment of their workers. I've witnessed on several occasions managers attempting (and failing) to quietly berate several workers. They then turn around with a smile on their face and act like they didn't just treat the waiter or food runner like french fries they found under the grill.

I have no desire to return, as Houlihan's is nothing more than an overpriced restaurant with nothing to offer as justification for it's prices"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this restaurant , it's a great place to hang with friends, enjoy good food and great drinks. Tonight we had a bit of an issue that happened with one of our meals, but the staff got right on it and offered our table a dessert. Our server, Gabby, was awesome and the manager was very friendly. Needless to say, we will continue to come and enjoy our time at Houlihan's! #GabbyforCorporate See, we said we'd put it. Thanks Houlihan's staff!"}
{"text":"Went for birthday dinner with wife / kids and my mother who was visiting from Florida. Ordered apps which came out in 15 mins or so...but entrees still were not served almost 45 minutes after that. Actually, not sure when the entrees would have ever been served because we didn't hang around to experience them. If you are so swamped in the kitchen, don't seat people!  On a positive note, the calamari wasn't bad. But bottom line, I expect a lot more out of a restaurant on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Can I say that I just say that I LOVE Houlihans.   The food is always good.  I feel as though I'm getting good food, at a good price and it always tastes like the chef knows what the heck is going on.  Lol.  I absolutely love the small plates and the pot roast...OMG. Okay, don't get me started.  In all honesty though, I know that Houli's is one place that I can go, it will be good and any problems will be corrected immediately.  Now that's how you keep a customer coming back.  Thank you Houlihan's for showing your customer some love!"}
{"text":"The food was below average at best. I had chicken parm & my gf had ribs w asparagus. The parm was tasteless and her asparagus smelled & tasted like propane. The margherita flatbread was flavorless. Not the trypical Houlihan's meals we're accustomed to."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night.  Absolutely delicious. We had Calamari, French Onion soup, the Kansas City Hamburger, loaded baked potato, Oriental Chopped salad.  Everything was prepared perfectly. Great flavors.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"While I'm waiting on my silverware with my dinner directly in front of me. I figured I'll write a review! I ordered the 9oz steak which comes with either soup or salad and two side dishes. I chose soup, and he asked me if I wanted green beans or asparagus. I chose asparagus. When my dinner arrived I chuckled to my husband saying \"at least the waiter chose my other side\"! 
Thought it was odd how he just placed my plate on the table and ran off. I was like \"dude you didn't check to see if I like the way my steak is cooked\"! Overheard him telling the people next to us how he's a real estate agent and gave them his business card. Just off! Ready to go home at this point."}
{"text":"We've been patrons of this Houlihan's over ten years and I can say without a doubt the food quality has been suffering significantly for some time. Nevermind the menu...now half what it once was, but it's unforgivable to pare down and still manage to foul up what's left. In the last ten visits we've spoken to the manager five times and by rights it could've been more. Pittsburgh's south hills has limited options and it's being exploited here, but do we deserve and continue to support rubbery chicken parm(microwave chef), a very long hair in the salad dressing, cold pommes frites, missing bananas on an entree' salad that's supposed to have them?  The short version, talking with a manager is ok, (we're not eager to see a mega chain Joe's Crab or Carraba's take over), but it doesn't do any good here ...and really, should you have to at all?  Sorry Houli's, but we're done with ya."}
{"text":"I really like this Houlihan's, for several good reasons:  They keep the menu fresh, with seasonal side-menus, so there is usually something new.  The service, for this price-point, is above what I typically see, especially in this area.  Servers typically know their menus and dishes well, and can answer questions in detail.

The menu is centered on American cuisine:  some beef, some chicken, some seafood, several deluxe, entrée salads, a handful of sandwiches, and some starters.  They do have some unique starters:  White Bean Humus, for example.  It comes with toasted pita bread and fresh vegetables (baby carrots, celery, and sliced cucumber).  It is delicious."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Consistently good good and service. However the menu has been trimmed by about 3/4.  But what remains is done well. A little more pricey than I remember from past trips. But worth it.  The food was less like that of a chain, and seemed more personal and well thought out.  Good job Houlihans 
The baked potato soup is fantastic lettuce wrap appetizer and pot stickers delish. .
The grilled salmon was perfectly done and amazing, creamy golden mash and asparagus side completed a great dinner.
So glad we came back."}
{"text":"Flat out this place just sucks. We went there tonight. Over an hour wait for any food to arrive after ordering then when the appetizers came they were not even warm. Actually just room temp. 

After bringing this to the managers attention she professed to fix the problem. I asked joe she would fix it and she responded by saying she would get new fresh ones made. 

About three minutes later our dinners were delivered, ICE COLD, congealed from sitting for so long. We got up and walked out. Telling her about on the way out since she was at the front of the house, not in the back fixing a terribly broken kitchen. 

This place was a shit show. Never going back. We went up the road to delallo's and had a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I went to the Galleria this past weekend with a friend of mine who lives in the South Hills.  Naturally lunch goes with shopping as Oreos go with a glass of milk.  One thing I've learned though is that each restuarant should be judged on its own merits.  To be fair, the chicken salad sandwich I had was pretty good.  One thing I like about Houlihan's is that you can get a choice of sides.  So instead of fries, I tried the peanut ginger slaw with my sandwich.  It was pretty good!   

For dessert, we split a vanilla bean creme brulee that was good too.  They do offer an Italian Style donut concoction.  Pump that insulin Susan, pump!"}
{"text":"The special of the Maryland Crab Cakes was very tasty. It came with 3 small 1/2 dollar sized lumps. The accompaniments very tasty and blended well. As usual with good crab cakes, there is never enough."}
{"text":"We have been coming to houlihans for years, it's close and it's always good and there is almost never a long wait.
There is a lot to be said for a consistent restaurant. This place is always clean, the food is always good and the service is always excellent! 
The manager is always there, and he's been there for years! The food options are wide, from bar food and burgers to pasta and healthy choices.
Drink specials and the tv at the bar will always have a Steeler game in the fall and Penguins in the winter.
Even though I try not to go to chains when I can avoid it, but houlihans is one that I will return to."}
{"text":"Great little hidden place...friendly staff...great food! Diane (waitress) takes the cake though...she's hysterically awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Since I live in the neighborhood - I come here quite often for drinks and quick bites. They have a nice bar and a great outdoor seating. It's a great place to watch games and just hangout with your friends.

Try the Thai Chilli Wings!"}
{"text":"Ok we are athoukihans right now.   The guys name is Bruce and the girls name is Andrea.   Nicest staff in town hands down!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here but I hate restaurants that randomly decide to shut down their to go orders.  I have ordered to go for years and apparently they have now decided not to do it when they are busy."}
{"text":"Just left here which we always went to this location.  This time and last were subpar to say the least. Ordered chicken nacho's. These used to be awesome and now they are aweful. The chips were burnt and dry and the little dip of guacamole you could not even taste. The drinks did not have any alcohol in them. But I will say the service was great. Food has definitely gone down hill. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch. I had the small buffalo chicken salad which was the perfect portion and delicious. My friends had the artichoke balls with goat cheese. They were excellent! I would order them again. We also tried the summer special- fried asparagus. They were not greasy. I would come back to this location again. Service was great and food presentation was spot on."}
{"text":"Houlihan's is a total hit or miss experience.  I've had times where it was a wonderful experience and meal and times where everything went wrong.  
I've been to this location with only one other person and also in larger groups.  It seems some servers are better equipped/more used to large groups then others.
The restaurant itself is fairly long and narrow.  Booths on the side and tables in the middle with the bar in the back.  The kitchen has clear glass windows so you can mostly see in the kitchen (but not the type of set up where you can really see the chefs or food prep).
I like the menu because it is the type where there really is something for everyone.  There is more trendy stuff like avocado (which was delicious but should have been called guacamole toast).  Things like ahi tuna as well.  But also standard burgers, salads and grilled chicken.
Presentation of the food is generally done pretty well and everything I've ordered has been tasty.
As I mentioned earlier, there are some servers that don't seem as trained, so those experiences haven't been as nice, but the management does what they can to make it right."}
{"text":"Darren and I came here last weekend before seeing the new Wolverine movie, and I loved it. The chicken/avocado eggrolls are an excellent app. I also savored the Petite (4 ounce) Filet Mignon, their mashed potatoes (sooo good), and their S'mores Crock, which is one of the neatest desserts anywhere (you dip sugary graham cracker sticks and fresh strawberries into this marshmallow/chocolate fondue...mmm...). The service was great. Some of the waitresses show a little too much leg, though (they kept having to pull down their tight, shirt skirts). Anyway, good eats here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday night to celebrate my bday with the coupon Houlihans gave me.  There was a 25 min wait but a lot of open tables.  The hostess explained that there was a large group dining there and due to getting backed up in the kitchen, they weren't seating everyone right away bc it would take too long to get their food which doesn't logically make sense.  By the looks of things, they were short on wait staff and not seating patrons in every section.  There was live music which was enjoyable.  Once seated our waitress was friendly, food was good and the experience was overall pleasant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. Especially since they gave me a coupon for my birthday, a very nice touch. 

A friend and I decided to go here before a movie in the Galleria Mall to grab some drinks and a late lunch on a nice Sunday afternoon. After we sat down in the dining room, we opened our menu to find that there was a happy hour all day on Sundays, and when we asked the waitress, she said it is only for the bar. I find this silly because 1) there was probably two tables of people in the entire restaurant- it wasn't like we were hogging a good seat, and 2) the hostess didn't tell us about the happy hour let alone that we had to sit in the bar; but I guess rules are rules. We politely asked if we could relocate, and we did; to the tiny back corner table of the empty bar area. 

We agreed to just let it go and enjoy our lunch: we decided on the loaded guacamole w/chips and the firecracker shrimp, and then we split the BBQ ribs dinner for our entree. 

The loaded guacamole had a sweet salsa & crumbled cheese on top, but it lacked flavor. It tasted like mashed up avocado; no lime juice or seasoning to speak of. The firecracker shrimp, although the shrimp were crispy, it tasted really mayo-y, and was not spicy at all! It was very off-putting.

The BBQ ribs were okay-tasting, but were barely warm let alone hot and the fries didn't have any seasoning on them.

The beer was cold, a plus I guess! Needless to say, I will not be back. Which is unfortunate because it's 10 minutes from my house, and I frequent the Galleria mall for movies and shopping on the weekends."}
{"text":"Food came out speratically for a table of 4... fire alarm flashed with recorded message of evacuation. . Worst risotto I ever had .   Other than that it was .... OK"}
{"text":"It is to be expected on a Friday evening for a restaurant to be busy. However when told the wait will be 45-50 minutes and you end up waiting 63 minutes, that to me says that the productivity is not doing well. But like I said, it was a Friday. So getting a beverage from the bar is recommended while you wait.
   We were seated in a nice booth. The server was nice, obviously a little overwhelmed, not holding that against her though. We were able to place our food order in a timely manner. 
    We started with chicken tortilla soup and a house salad. The soup consisted of corn, tomatoes, chicken and tortilla strings. It had a hint of lime and a kick. Resembles a chx fajita taste. The salad was a basic house salad with the exception of corn on it. It also had a choice of mozzarella or goat cheese, bacon bits, tomatoes and croutons.
    The entrées we chose were the shrimp tacos, a side of fries, and seared Georges scallops. The shrimp tacos consisted of 2 tacos with 3 jumbo grilled shrimp. Each soft taco had lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and lime and was drizzled with sour cream. Also served with a side of chips and salsa. The side of fries were good and obviously a generous serving size.
    The seared George's bank scallops were very good and were presented well. It was served over a bed of a basil infused olive oil rice and arugula with a balsamic glaze at the bottom. Definitely a thumbs up. 
    For dessert we decided to have the caramel almond crunch pie, because it was the picture on the dessert menu and looked fantastic! However, when it came it was melting! We were not aware it was ice cream cake! But whatever. It was very tasty! It was vanilla ice cream with crushed almonds mixed in. Chocolate and caramel crunchies on top with a chocolate almond cookie crust. 
    The wait was long, the service was not bad, the ambiance was nice/ casual, the food was good, the price was a little bit above average, but for dinner it was not bad."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the Mt. Lebanon location.  It seems every time we go it gets worse and worse.  This last visit was the straw that broke the camels back.  When we walked in, employees were huddled around the fire place and I became concerned.  As we were walking to our table there was a giant space heater sitting on a random table. I thought this was odd and unsafe.  Needless to say when we got to the table it wasn't a comfortable temperature.  We figured okay. Maybe they are having a problem. We'll tough it out. We were starving. We were greeted right away by our server who was very friendly. He brought us a jug of water to the table with our glasses. This is something new to us here, but it seems many restaurants are doing this now.  I'm not sure where they filled up this jug from, but I think tap water would've been better. I'm not even sure it was water it was so gross.   We both got something else to drink and ordered our food.  I went to visit the men's room and I wasn't even at the entrance to the bathrooms and was punched in the face by a god awful odor. The kind of odor that no single human is capable of producing(I'm not one that's overly smell sensitive). I held my breath and proceeded in.  The bathroom had to be 100+ degrees. This made the sewage smell unbearable.  There is definitely something major wrong with the plumbing here.  The bathroom itself was disgusting. Think creepy gas station bathroom and multiply that on the grossness scale.  When I got back to the table I started looking around closer and noticed the table wasn't really clean. The dust on the fixtures around the restaurant, you get the picture. With how dirty everything was. I was questioning the kitchen cleanliness.  I kept trying to talk myself out of how dirty it was because I was so hungry and didn't want to leave or wait somewhere else.  Huge mistake. Our food came out in a normal time frame. When it was delivered I noticed this god awful smell.  I thought it was the dressing on my girlfriends salad. Nope, it was the roast beef on my French dip.  I can't even explain how bad this was. Imagine cat food left sitting out for a week. The smell was so bad that we both were gagging with the plate sitting on the other end of the table. I was beyond grossed out as I already consumed soup.  I told my girlfriend to not eat her food as it definitely wasn't safe.  We hurriedly asked our server for the check and boxes as we aren't ones for confrontation. We got out of there as fast as we could.  Threw the food in the first garbage can we found and went elsewhere.   It's sad to see how far down hill this place has gone.  There are many new restaurants opening in the Galleria and we will choose them over Houlihan's from now on.  I highly suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"The goat cheese/asparagus poppers were good. The service was great, and the manager stopped by to check on us."}
{"text":"Food was good and atmosphere excellent.   However, the service was extremely slow, compromising the experience.  If you go, allow plenty of time and definitely order the S'mores fondue crock for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. My husband's pasta that was listed as spicy was not spicy but instead tasted like pure salt. I tried the chicken that they are known for and it was okay. The potato soup was very good. We had excellent service."}
{"text":"While my visits to Houlihan's are limited, every one of them makes me anxious for the next.  The service has been great at both the Washington Road and Robinson Mall locations.  The same can be said for the food. It's been served in a timely manner, it's delicious and more than generous.  Since I haven't tried the entire menu, I plan to stick with Houlihan's until I have the type of disappointing experience I've had at other restaurants.  I noticed that another reviewer calls the food expensive.  Unless that person is eating at fast food restaurants exclusively, I can't imagine what they would consider Houlihan's expensive."}
{"text":"We came to Houlihan's for Valentine's Day dinner, using a forgotten Christmas gift card! 7pm reservation, no wait. The lighting and decor was just right. We opted for the Valentine's menu. Their special shrooms really are amazing!!! Loved the house salad with corn - unique and refreshing. Entrees filet and salmon with sides followed by dessert trio. The food did come out a bit fast but it was all delicious and we had some to take home. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Houlihan's in is the Galleria so it's easy to find parking in the parking garage there. We came late on a Saturday and also had one of their $10 of $30 coupons so it was a perfect time to try it out. Surprisingly for being nearly 9pm there were quite a few diners. The thing I didn't like was how near we were seated to the bar area, because a few of the people hanging out there were very loud and on the verge of obnoxious. I also didn't like how dark the dining area was, I had to use the flashlight on my phone in order to ready the menu.  Our waitress Mary was very polite and kept the meal moving along at a perfect pace as well as keeping our beverages topped off. Didn't have any idea what kind of food they served here but a quick scan of the menu it appeared that they are trying to be a higher end chain restaurant. My husband started with the house salad and it looked awesome, you could smell the bacon on it as soon as it got to the table. It was loaded with fresh corn, tomatoes, shredded white cheddar and croutons all on top of a hearty bed of shredded lettuce (my favorite cause it's easy to eat!) He went with the Pot Roast. He said parts of the meat were tough which should never be the case with a pot roast and that the carrots were a little too al dente. Flavor was good and the crispy fried onions in top have a nice crunchy contrast. I went with the Scallops. 8 nice sized scallops surrounded a creamy risotto that had tiny little disks of asparagus running throughout. It was topped with a hearty helping of arugula. It could have used more salt but the scallops were cooked well and cleaned well so I guess I couldn't complain. Overall the meal was good but nothing spectacular. It seemed like they try to make more high-end dishes to compete with fancier restaurants, but the overall wow factor when comparing to one of those restaurants is lacking. Would I come back, maybe if I got invited to something, otherwise not likely."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and love the Salmon BLT.  The lettace wraps were pretty good as well.  Sat at the bar and had great service and TVs."}
{"text":"This place is great, we have been here twice recently in the past month and we had great customer service both times. First was Mother's Day and they gave all of us moms a flower as well as 10 dollars off our next visit. We went back to claim our 10 dollar voucher yesterday before catching a movie since it was so convenient. Mike our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. He found my son a pack of markers which kept him entertained the whole time. He also gave us another voucher which we will definitely be returning to use! Also, I would highly suggest this place for families because every kids meal comes with an appetizer \"carrots and ranch\" as well as a dessert \"ice cream with chocolate syrup\"."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially if you sit at the bar. The bartender I had was named Bruce, not only did he basically ignore me the entire time I was at the bar, I watched him make my Long Island iced tea (without any alcohol) but other drinks minus alcohol as well. I had to send the drink back and get a beer, if I didn't I would have gotten a virgin Long Island iced tea. 

Secondly, there were a ton of people at the bar however I received a drink and was promptly ignored for about 45 minutes. I was waiting to order food but couldn't because I did not exist to the bartenders. They eagerly served the \"regulars\" and had great conversation with them.

Unfortunately I couldn't give a rating under 1 star but if you are on a business trip, do NOT go to this restaurant unless you have to go hungry for the night and have no place else to stop."}
{"text":"It may not be fashionable to give high marks to this chain that tries hard not to seem like one, but I will. My case is as follows...

*The Spicy Chicken and Avocado Egg Rolls are a hearty, crunchy, meaty, and flavorsome example of fusion gone well.

*The Honest Gold Mashed Potatoes (they were out of Loaded Baked Potatoes, so this was a second choice) are an honest-to-goodness side-dish one would expect at your favorite aunt's home for Sunday dinner. Fluffy, thick, buttery, starchy notes for hours, adding bacon or cheddar or lobster to these simple and simply savory spuds would ruin them. 

*The So Cal Fish Tacos are packed with a flaky, wet, panko-coated tilapia, a piquant/sugary honey-cumin dressing, pico to wake the dead, a napa cabbage slaw to keep one regular, and a chipotle mayonnaise to glue it all together and because, well, mayo is nearly vital to almost anything savory and handheld. 

*The S'mores Crock continues to be one imaginatively decadent, deconstructed dessert.

*Houlihan's makes a damn deadly brownie sundae that rivals the best of the best anywhere. The hot, the fudgy, the creamy, the cold all combine to create a quintessential version of a dessert that appears on menus nationwide. 

*The service was phenomenal even if I wished some of the younger female staff weren't wearing short, tight skirts and so much makeup (trying too hard to get tips, ladies?). They resembled the bar-harpies that haunt Carson Street on Saturday nights, and they needn't have. 

On the downside, this Houlihan's is located in Mt. Lebanon's Galleria mall, so one can expect to dine alongside the privileged, the Botoxed, the money-hungry, the hair-plugged, and the overly tanned. 

Nonetheless, as with the other Houlihan's franchises I've visited, this location dependably dished out to us a meal that was respectably above the notch of average, Houli's givin' us what we needed prior to catching a certain comics-inspired feature at the nearby Carmike.

Snikt! Bub.

P.S. On a Friday evening, as busy as the house was, we were seated without waiting a single minute. Were we just lucky?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and surprisingly there was a 30 minute wait. We walked around but there really aren't many shops left in the galleria worth going in. 

I ordered the heartland grilled chicken salad and my friend ordered the buffalo blue chicken salad. The heartland salad was ok nothing special. Grilled chicken, red bell pepper, pecans, cheddar, croutons and garlic ranch. There was barely any dressing so I asked for more on the side. 

For dessert, we had the mini fried chocolate donuts. They were freshly made and delicious. Can't beat a crispy warm donut covered in sugar. Overall nothing special, a standard chain with mediocre food."}
{"text":"We love the Houlihans back home, and so it was a no brainier to eat here before catching a movie.

We were seated right away, and our waitress was absolutely fantastic, I believe her name was Jennifer. Very attentive and friendly, made the good call of bringing our sons food out with the appetizer. 

The food was phenomenal, we ordered the spicy chicken and avocado eggrolls. Honestly, I could eat and entire meal of just those. 

He ordered the 9oz sirloin with loaded baked potato and a southwest chicken soup. The steak was cooked to perfection and he loved the rest. 

I ordered the chicken parmesan and French onion soup. The soup was fantastic and the bread and pasta was delicious. The chicken, not so much, but that may be me. Something about the texture of chicken parmesan just doesn't delight me. 

Drinks stayed filled and dishware was constantly being cleared from the table. 

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"No Wifi available. Waitress seems \"off\". Napkins? Sugar? Unfamiliar with drink menu. Oh, my."}
{"text":"The waitress we had was the only good part of my meal. Went for my birthday because I got a coupon for a free entree. I'm allergic to shellfish and told my waiter ahead of time that I had an allergy. I tried to order 4 different times and was told I couldn't order anything that was fried (even chips or fries) because they only have one fryer for their fried food. As somebody with an allergy, this is ridiculous. Restaurant standards dictate that you have at least two fryers for your fried food. Not only could I not order what I want, but when we alerted the manager to this (very politely) he became very agitated, rude, and belligerent and berated us for not ordering something different. Although he ended  up taking my food off of the bill, I was very disappointed with the quality of service and the management in general. I used to love Houlihan's, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went here tonight to grab dinner with my dad. We used a $10 off of $30 localflavor coupon, which was a great deal. Ian was our server and he was excellent! I ordered the burger with fries and French onion soup. My father ordered the Thursday special, which was the stuffed chicken with cheese and a loaded baked potato. He said he loved his meal. The stuffed chicken was going to be my second option if I had not gotten the burger. My burger was tasty and they offer many different options of cheese. I went with Gouda. I asked for medium well and it came out pretty well done. That's probably my only complaint. The fries were great and the side of ranch I requested was really flavorful. My favorite part of my meal was the French onion soup!! It was super cheesy and delicious. You have to get it!! Yum! They also had live music playing tonight (Thursday)."}
