{"text":"Just moved to North Ridgeville about a month ago and decided to try Wasabi for a few sushi rolls for a light dinner as it's near our house.  I was skeptical as it seemed very quiet there for a Saturday night.  I picked up my take out and the staff was very friendly.  My husband and I loved our sushi! Had the Cleveland Browns Roll and the Dynamite Roll, and an order of crab rangoon and everything was awesome.  This place was also really affordable!  Definitely our new go to for take-out sushi."}
{"text":"This seems to be our go to for faux sushi (not raw). Spicy shrimp roll, and lobster roll. Order extra spicy mayo, it is very good. We have had many other rolls that were good as well. Their crab rangoon is very good. Order extra Thai chili sauce, it's a great dip. The best surprise we had was the avocado salad. It is an iceberg lettuce with avocado on top, however, the dressing they make, makes this simple salad one of the best. Ask for Mitch , he is a very good waiter."}
