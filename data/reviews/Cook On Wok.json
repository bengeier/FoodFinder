{"text":"It's more of a 2.5 star to me, here, but whatever. I tried this place several years ago and the food bored me too much to become a regular customer.

We finally gave it another go, because maybe things are different now, etc. Just like the first time, service was friendly, and I liked the restaurant's ambiance and cleanliness. Price is nice for the lunch specials. But, just as before, we found the food boring and mediocre.

In the same way that the five star reviewers here can't understand why us two and three star reviewers are disappointed by the food, I just can't understand how anyone could call it yummy, great, or the BEST. It's nowhere close to those things for me. Too bad."}
{"text":"I can't eat at a place that is 86 degrees. I know that electricity costs go way up in Summer but I will never go here again. Even though the food was OK."}
{"text":"I want my money back. This is probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I ordered the general gau's chicken yesterday and it was not even edible. I ended up throwing it away after eating one piece. There's almost no chicken and what was breaded was really saturated and soggy with the sauce. The rice was boring and kind of mushy. The eggroll looked and tasted store-bought and it seemed cooked that way too.  I really wish I could get my money back. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food here is very hit and miss, with the hits being great and the misses being pretty bad.  I really enjoy the kung pao chicken which is flavorful and not too greasy.  The pad thai (yeah, it's a chinese restaurant but it's on the menu) is surprisingly good.  I would avoid the pork dishes which use bbq pork slices and are very bland.  Try the small portions first to see what you like and go on from there.

BTW, the service is here always really friendly and quick.  Big smile for that!"}
{"text":"Egg rolls were pretty good. Then we got our entrees: happy family and steamed fish. The fish was not fresh, and the happy family was way overcooked and also not fresh. Nothing in the happy family was fresh, and the crab meat actually looked like noodles. 

Service was adequate, but a little slow. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical about ordering Chinese food for delivery (especially if I have never been in the building myself), as I have had WAY more than one bad experience with different Chinese restaurants.  I recently moved here from out of state and since the pots and pans were still buried within the jillions of boxes - I took a chance with a coupon I had found in a local ad that came in the mail.  I am glad I took the risk....the food was delicious!  And at LAST a Chinese food place that answers the phone with perfect English - I actually understood him!

I figured I would order a variety of items to meet the minimum $15 delivery requirement - and also so that if one item was bad I could default to the next (a plan that turned out to be completely unnecessary since I enjoyed every last bite - even on day two!).  I was a bit worried when the delivery driver called to reconfirm the directions = lost.  I thought \"oh great - now it's going to be cold so there is NO CHANCE this is going to be okay\" - WRONG!!!  The driver rolled up in a Benz, so I assume they either pay the drivers WAY too much, or he was the owner.   He was dressed impeccably, extremely friendly - and the food was still piping hot!  

I started with a cup of the Wor WonTon Soup.  Glad I did not get the bowl, as it was a very nice size.  The broth was clear, the veggies fresh and crisp with two humongous wontons in it - as well as some extra chicken and a massive tasty shrimp in it.  Then I moved on to the cream cheese wontons.  They did these right, although I would have preferred a thinner wrapper that absorbed less oil (no biggie as they still were very good).  Then I sampled the spare ribs.  I am used to tiny little ribs and these suckers were giant slabs!  A bit more fat than I would have liked, but the sauce definitely made up for it.  For the main course I ordered the House Special Chicken and steamed rice and it was cooked perfectly (no dark meat or \"what the heck is this?\"  in there) and I highly recommend it.

So I am now 10 pounds heavier than I was yesterday (I finished the left over spare ribs for breakfast) and I have had no gastro-intestinal problems to speak of.  I hope this wasn't a fluke due to their Grand Opening and they remain consistent with their quality, fair prices and level of service.  If they can keep it up, they will have a loyal customer for as long as I remain in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's too bad. We've been loyal customers to this establishment for a long time. Henry has always been good to us and made sure the cooks prepared our food the way we requested. We decided to stop by today but we forgot that he wasn't working, instead we had to deal with the nightmare that is May. She is just about one of the rudest people I've ever had to deal with, and when we had a flavorless dish come out of the kitchen and we complained about it, she said that's the way we had to eat it and charged us for the dish anyway.  She had no concern for the happiness of her customers or the capacity to be able to understand why we were dissatisfied.  She straight up said she did not care if she lost out on a customer.  You don't say that to customers that order 50-80 dollar checks.  She was so concerned about losing out on a dish that cost 10 that she didn't realize she lost out on much more than that in the long run. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has changed since I visited a few times over a year ago.  It is under new management according to the menu at the front desk.  The white rice did not taste freshly steamed, it was dry, and had an odd after taste.  The sesame chicken had a sweet dry coating like sweet & sour chicken but with the addition of sesame seeds.  And the other menu item I tried reminded me of kung pao chicken but with shrimp and beef added.  The shrimp was deveined... The chicken texture was decent... The beef was soft and chewy.  This meal was not tasty.  I will not go here again.  Restaurants that I use as a comparison are China wan wan and Chopstix.  
 
Does anyone know of a superb Chinese-food joint? I am losing hope with these trial and error attempts to find a quality, fresh, no msg, place with suitable meat texture!"}
{"text":"After having a good experience ordering takeout from here once, I stopped by for a quick lunch on Monday afternoon and I thought it was pretty good, however if you order the food to go it seems like they cook it a little better. My dine in entree, sweet and sour pork, had vegetables in it which were basically still hard and raw.  I'd try it again but would order something else."}
{"text":"We come here over and over and over. This place is amazing. They know us and what we order, even down to the side of chili oil my wife always request, they had that out. The food is some of the best around and prices are right on point. It's tucked away behind the circle k. If u want great Chinese, definitely come here!!!"}
{"text":"We are a younger couple who loves good Chinese food. This place is absolutely delicious from the soup to the main entree. The service is amazing and so nice EVERY time. It's a hidden gem located beside the bank and behind the circle k."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad dish here. The pot stickers are excellent and the pad Thai is good to. Service is always quick and their always polite."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood Chinese Restuarant.  Service is great and the food is delicious.   We always order the Dinner A, which includes soup, appetizers a fried rice and two large entress'  for $25.95.   The Honey Walnut Shrimp is excellent and so is the Kung Pao Chicken if you like a dish spicy.   They also have  delivery which is  convenient  for people that want to stay in.  Yummy more Cook on Wok Please!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS: kung Pao chicken, orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken. WORST Chinese food ever. It went straight to trash and no dinner for the night. Called owner to let them know. He offered some $ credit but I refused since I won't try their food ever again. - Hope it helps others. Cheers."}
{"text":"I love to order my chinese food for delivery to my house. I have never been inside the restaurant but they always deliver my food quickly to my door. They make great noodles, rice and meat dishes. I wasn't a fan of the Honey Walnut Shrimp. It was breaded and not at all like Im used to. The orange chicken was more sweet and sour chicken but so good. I really liked the free sushi when you order over 25 bucks worth of food."}
{"text":"Really screwed place where you order before, while one goes shopping food arrives and they insist person ordering has to be there mind you that you're in the system and have ordered while other places are courteous and respectful. Gave them ID and 2nd card for security and yet no. Sent food back. Checking card for refund!"}
{"text":"Wow, great Chinese food and in this little hidden away plaza by a gas station!  Everything was wonderful, appetizers were perfect. Staff was great, what a hidden gem in Henderson!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  We order take out or dine in at least once a week.  We love the Honey Walnut Shrimp, Kung Pao Chicken and there Fried Rices are all excellent.  The staff is very helpful and prompt.  They have some awesome Lunch specials too.  Quality food for the money.  Our favorite neighborhood Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Obviously another Americanized unhealthy Chinese food restaurant, and nothing wrong with a little unhealthy dinner on occasion. I've had a few dishes, The vegetable fried rice was delicious, the eggplant in garlic sauce was pretty good but could be better. Obivous choices like sesame tofu isnt on the menu, but im from NY so I guess I became used to it. Asking a question here isn't the easiest thing to do, I wish an email was available to ask them if the brown sauce is vegetarian or not, I have a feeling none of there items is really vegetarian"}
{"text":"The Honey Walnut Shrimp and Beef and Broccoli are my favorites.  The Won ton soup is amazing too, it was loaded with chicken, bbq pork, shrimp, fresh veggies and lots of Won Tons.  Came out super hot also, the way I like it.  The service is friendly and very accommodating.  One of my fav Chinese Restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food, wonderful service and good prices. I will definitely return. Had low mein and fried rice with wonton soup. It was packed full of meat and the wonton soup was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I give them 0 stars because the food was HORRIBLE first off. Second half my order was wrong.  And to top it off the cashier was rude!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 2 years! Their shrimp fried rice is awesome! It is located right next to my work, so it is very convienant for me. Love the service here! Very fast and friendly! Their lunch menu is also cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE This place was horrible- the lady se arrived 9.00 pm and BEFORE she said \"hello\" of \"welcome \" se made a bad face and told us in a bad mood than they were closing at 9.30 pm all the time and each time we would ask for something she would answer first of all with a \"we need to close al 9.30 pm\" she was nasty and NOTHING nice nor polite, she made us feel we just came to bother Her and her family business; finally at 9.30 pm she practically kicked us out from the place.  AS COSTUMERS WE FELT HUMILIATED  AND WE WILL NEVER RETURN. This lady was really despotic please eat in somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food is ok however it's not good enough to have the cashier be rude. If this place was not so close to the house I would NEVER eat here. 
Bathroom looks as if it has never EVER been cleaned. I can only wonder how clean they keep the kitchen. 
I have to say this is the last time I eat here. Well maybe if I am starving to DEATH. There are WAY better places to eat in the area. Pizza Hut would have been a better option. I knew how this place is and I knew better. This time was my bad but never again. 
I think the Health Department should come take a look. I'm not sure they would even pass. Ohhhhh well what can you do!"}
{"text":"The shrimp and lobster sauce is simply the best in town.  Great food and always super service.  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time the other day because I was craving chicken and rice, something soo simple and yet they managed to ruin my appetite. 24 bucks on a few bites. Gross!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from there last night and it was the worst food possible. I ordered garlic chicken with fried rice and a order of vegetables. When I got home opened the containers the garlic chicken was drenched with a brown sauce which was very sweet and over powered the food and made the food soggy.. then the vegetables were also drenched in the same sweet brown sauce.. the \"
\"Fried Rice\" was white rice drenched in soy sauce, it wasn't \"fried rice\" the food was NASTY DISGUSTING , I couldn't eat it!! I will never order their again $22.00 down the drain. I could have gone to Panda Express and gotten better quality food for a cheaper or about the same price!!
DO NOT EAT THEIR!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. NASTY FOODS. I want to give NO STAR if i could. I ordered spicy shrimp called szechuan shrimp. But it wasnt spicy at all and vegies taste like someone $@#÷ in there. I spit it out immediately. And server  (tall guy) was RUDE. Extremely Rude in front of your face. Ah i wish ive never went here. Feel like i ate some trash"}
{"text":"In general, I like Cook On Wok. The food is OK, the portions are adequate, and the food is served lightning fast. Delivery is fast too. 

What I am saying is that for the cost, the overall quality is in line with my expectations. 

For the positives: taste, looks and quantity. The two guys that greet customers are awesome. 

For the negatives: The store is a mess and the bathrooms look like they are plague incubators. The older asian lady that is there sometimes is rude and makes me want to walk out before I even place an order. 

All in all, I eat there because the food is OK and filling. It isn't great but most Chinese restaurants are marginal too."}
{"text":"Total bummer.  Food arrived hot but I'm not sure what we ate!
Chicken Lo Mein - noodles were tasty and favorable - however, the chicken was weird - was dark meat that was stringy and rubbery - should have order vegetable probably would have been better.
Potstickers - they were very good, however the sauce that came with it was just terrible.  I'm not sure what that was.
General's Chicken - we had two bites and threw that away.  Ordered it Spicy.  No heat what so ever.  Sauce just didn't cut it.  And chicken was rubbery.
They gave us free fried wontons.  They were ok.
So I guess We will continue to search for decent Chinese food cause I would never order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is great for fast take out. It's only a couple dollars more and a couple minutes longer than Panda, but it's better by far. Our favorites are the beef chow fun, Mongolian beef, and mandarin shrimp."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience with Cook on Wok. We would recommend this resturaunt to everyone looking for affordable asian food delivered fast and fresh. The quality of the food was delicious and we will be ordering again in the future. Our only regret is we feel we insufficiently tipped the delivery driver. We apologize and hope to recieve the same driver in the future so we can sufficiently tip the driver for his fast delivery."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I am confused by the other reviews...is this the same restaurant?

I have ordered to go as well as delivery from this restaurant and have been more than happy! From what I have tasted its the best Chinese food delivery in Henderson!

They have awesome lunch specials (Including multiple vegetarian options!) for a very fair price. You get large portions, and I think that the food is damn good. They use no MSG and the vegtables are good. The sauce isn't too gooey and they are very lenient on changing menu items-even specials which usually doesn't happen! 

They also send out coupons for free delivery and free meals that easily top the competitors coupons. 

My boyfriend and I can each get two full meals (4 total containing a entree, rice (fried or steamed), a veggie roll, and if you dine in soup, for under $20, which is enough to last for 3 meals for each of us. (Don't judge we are very busy and it's nice to have extra food in the fridge). 

Cheap and good? I will be back!"}
{"text":"Threw away $80 dollars of food. The food tasted like it was on the verge of spoilage.  How do you mess up fried rice?"}
{"text":"Food is so good, portions are good! Best egg rolls. Want food to go, they at every quick! The sweet and sour chicken is perfect as it should be. Make great hot and sour soup as well as wonton is great. We usually leave with food for entire family for around $20 and enough for 2 days! Absolutely must try. There lunch dine in meals are also great and real cheap!"}
{"text":"One year ago I would've given cook on wok on Stephanie a five star review. They had the best Chinese food that I've tasted since I've been here in Las Vegas in 16 years from California. In the past few months they have changed their recipes for the lo mein and rice that we usually get. It is not the same and I'm so disappointed. I hope that they go back to their roots and offer the recipes they used to about 6-8 months ago. And apparently they now run out of food you want to order.   We wanted lemon chicken tonight and was told they were out of stock. How does that happen?

Still not original, I really miss the old food recipes,  and out of regular pork like we wanted.  Unfortunately this will be the last time we go there. If it was fresh they would've had the regular pork that we wanted rather that the BBQ pork we settled for.  Dammit we wanted regular pork-fried rice.  And now there's a big ass container of sauce that comes with  lemon chicken, which seriously could be used for pork fried rice chicken fried rice anything pork or steak with a sweet sauce..  our old Cook on Wok please come back."}
{"text":"I would rather be punched in the face, than eat anything from this Cook on Wok location."}
{"text":"For quick and cheap Chinese food, this isn't a bad option. A close friend of mine grew up in a household that owned several Chinese restaurants (which is funny because she is Taiwanese), so if she says this is authentic, I will take her word for it.

Food: I've only gone for the lunch special- very cheap and quite good. I usually get the Lemon Chicken special- You get soup, an egg roll, entree and rice for $5.95, much cheaper than places like Panda. I love their Egg Drop soup. I have always been a fan of Egg Drop but I love theirs the most- It's not to thick or goopy, they use the right amount of corn starch in my opinion, and they actually add seasoning flavors, so it's not just the bland chicken stock, thickener and egg. A little soy sauce and pepper on this and I am golden! The Lemon Chicken was good too- Not too sweet, tangy and plenty of the lemon sauce on the side to spoon onto my rice for a little flavor kick!

Price: Did I mention they are cheap? You cant even get a combo at McDonalds for this meager pittance any more! Great portions for the cost, and the service is fast.

All in all, if you're looking for some place quick, affordable and Chinese, this is a good one to keep in your pocket.  Great.. now I'm craving Egg Drop soup.. *grumble grumble*"}
{"text":"1st off.. The guy on the phone was nice and seemed very willing to help me.. It's a real pleasant surprise when some one is helpful and pays attention to you.. But it was all down hill after that.. The delivery time was acceptable no where near fast but not slow by any means.. I requested that the delivery driver call me when he gets at my home, due to me being upstairs and i have a bad knee so I'm not fast down the stairs. I am startled by all the dogs in the house freaking out because the driver was pounding on my door.. Almost breaking my neck running down stairs i go answer the door.. I answered the door and politely asked why you didn't call he didn't even apologize..   He seemed smug and un interested in what i had to say.. my total was 21.90 i had 25 to tip him 3$ but in the midst of all the mess I left it upstairs.. I handed him 23$ and he looked at me like I was stupid and said only 23 dollars..? Astounded I just shut the door.. I went back upstairs and settled in bed, the only reason I did order delivery is because I wasn't feeling well.. I open the bags and come to find out there was no fork or spoon not even a napkin in the bag.. Having to go back down stairs sick and on a bad knee to grab silverware I open my food and the chicken fried rice was descent, good flavor. The coconut chicken was like chicken in coconut soup, soggy and not done very well at all.. Due to this whole experience I will not be ordering from them at all ever again.."}
{"text":"It is a pretty standard Americanized Chinese restaurant. It is close to our home, so it is in the rotation of our go to places when we are feeling lazy or just don't feel like cooking. We only dined in once and the service was fine. The prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get. The menu is hit or miss, so if you find something that you like it is best to stick with it. I personally enjoy Happy Family (shrimp, chicken and beef), Szechwan Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. These items come with steamed rice and are $5.75 for small and $8.95 for a large. I think a large entree is easily shareable if you get an appetizer or a soup to split as well. They do have a lunch special that ranges from $4.95 to $6.25 and includes an egg roll, rice, and a soup or hot tea if you're dining in. It is a good deal, but don't expect a ton of meat in your entree during the lunch special."}
{"text":"I got here 1 minute after 3:00pm -- 1 minute -- and she told me that they don't serve lunch anymore.  So I threatened to leave, thinking full well she would ask me to stay and say \"Okay, I'll let it slide this time...\" but she didn't.  Halfway to my car I realized I was hungry, so I returned and asked if I could look at the menu anyway.

Dammit.

I got the small portion of orange chicken which ended up being about the same price anyway.  Despite the initial annoyance, I found it very tasty and scrumptious (did I just use the word scrumptious?), so I'm bumping my review up to a 4.  Just make sure to get there PLENTY OF TIME before lunch ends at 3.  Jeez."}
{"text":"Horrrrrible experience. Hair in rice, no hairnets used in kitchen and gloves are iffy. Terrible customer service, manager rude, says owner doesnt care and is never there anyways.

WARNING!!!DONT EAT HERE. YOU WILL BE SORRY!"}
{"text":"Seriously the most bland Chinese food I've ever had. Ordered the Szechwan Chicken that has a hot pepper next to the description and it still didn't have any taste. Portion size is good as is the price and you can order online but ask for extra sauce of any kind if you want it to taste like something."}
{"text":"What a nice experience...good Chinese food, you must try the eggplant dish...delicious!! The service is good, they are very friendly, food is fresh....My only recommendation will be about the bathroom, keep it clean please."}
{"text":"We have tried a number of Oriental restaurants and are usually disappointed but their Lemon Chicken was very good.  So was the Kung     Pau (sp. ?)  chicken. We have eaten there a lot and the food and service is always good.  Great neighborhood place to eat with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have never had a bad experience this is my daughters favorite place to eat as the  people here are always so sweet and the food is yummy"}
{"text":"The good was pretty good - I would ask that they use the chicken pieces from the sweet and sour chicken for the lemon chicken - It alot more flavorful - The BBQ Pork Fried Rice is awesome - Overall great food for the area compared to Panda Express."}
{"text":"I always bring my husband and my family to this place and I have nothing but good experiences with these people! Great food and our server is great! She knows my exact order by heart every time, fresh food great service and the pricing is fair."}
{"text":"The food here is ok.  Reasonable prices.  The first time I went I had the MuShu Pork which was good, but the second time I got Cashew Chicken which just did not do it for me.  Food came out fast.  But it took forever for the waiter to take care of our bill because he got ONE other table."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely awful and I'm not at all picky about my cheap and greasy Chinese take out. I got the teriyaki chicken lunch special. The chicken was the consistency of jello, didn't even taste like meat and the fried rice was just hard, gross and plain. The portion was smaller than a usual lunch special at other places but even worse - my box was like 80% rice and so little chicken! Even the egg roll was just meh, although I was starving and I usually love egg rolls :( Wouldn't go back here or recommend it."}
{"text":"Decent food at a good price. Nothing hugely special. We go there mostly because it's 2 minutes away. Ambiance is a little lacking...but it serves it's purpose. No complaints. Wouldn't drive very far to eat there, but if your a local...stop by."}
{"text":"Beyond worth the money. My wife and I come every other weekend. Food is amazing. Great service as well."}
{"text":"I don't know what the bad reviews are all about. Yes, it was crappy before. Bad service and bad food. THAT was the first time I had it back in August 2011.

Management has changed since then, so did the food and service. I work next door so it's a walking distance for me to get lunch. I don't have a personal favorite but DO try any of their lunch special. Ranges from $6-$7.50ish. There's a $10 limit on cards but sometimes they may forgive you if you don't have cash. 

I've tried almost everything on their lunch menu. Well, I usually eat off of my co-workers' take out lunches. Busy days are Fridays and Mondays around lunch. Just FYI. But it's a great place for a sit down restaurant for something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"It's your stereotypical badly decorated Chinese restaurant with the stereotypical Chinese restaurant fare.

Ordered House Special Chicken and House Special Lo Mein. The chicken was the typical spicy-ish coated chicken nuggets with broccoli. The lo mein was a bit oily, as per usual, but okay.

Probably wouldn't go back unless I REALLY couldn't think of any other place to go. Which is pretty unlikely to happen."}
{"text":"The food is great (in my opinion), and Stephen the owner is a nice guy as well. I recommend giving them a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so this joint is under \"new management\" and I'm going to be frank here when I say the food sucks now.  

I gave this place 2 different times to surprise me with their original flavors and quality of food but alas.. it's seems to be consistently poor.

Cook on Wok has maintained 3 out of the 5 stars for the following reasons:

1) their not so delicious food is still reasonably priced on the lunch menu
2) I'm lazy and they deliver
3) I'm EXTREMELY lazy so not only do they deliver but you can order it to be delivered ON-LINE, haha.

If you're feeling cheap and lazy and don't care if the food is top notch or not, give them a whirl.

With any luck the \"old management\" is just on vacation??"}
{"text":"I work next door and I come here often.. Today was the worst experience I have ever had. I understand the lady who waited on us is new but she brought out everyone else's food and I'm sitting here with nothing for at least 30 minutes before someone I was sitting with went and asked her where my food was.. They all kind of looked at each other like they had no idea what she was talking about then they threw it together quickly and brought it out.. We had a hour and 20 minute lunch and spent all of it here waiting for food. And they still charged me full price.. The food is always great but For real I repeated my order 3 times to her and she even repeated it back and still forgot my order???? Kind of ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Five stars I don't give five stars to often. (Nope!) But what I will say about Cook On Wok is that the owners have done their homework to have a successful business. They get that we want and deserve excellent service hot food and great prices. 
 From my pictures you see first hand that I love the shrimp. When I eat here I feel spoiled and catered to. The staff are respectful and the place is clean. I give them 2 thumbs up and a yey! along with fifty billion stars. oh and a cabbage patch dance :)"}
{"text":"Delicious. The spicy eggplant was bomb. If you love coconut def order the coconut chicken. It's like katsu style with big coconut flakes and sauce. Yummy! Everything is tasty."}
{"text":"Do not order the Mongolian beef or twice cooked pork. I ate here after a recommendation from my mom, and I will admit the classic fare of fried rice and wontons were good but the entrées we chose were almost inedible. The Mongolian beef was 95% undercooked white onions with maybe 5 pieces of under seasoned beef in the small order, I really wish this was an exaggeration. The twice cooked pork had the same issue and was noted on the menu as spicy but definitely was not.

If you come here stick to the appetizers, rice and noodle dishes and avoid the entrées if you want your money's worth."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for years, and each time they remember me...Awesome feeling! The food is always fresh, hot and affordable. Only thing I wish was that there were vegetables in the fried rice. But everything else is good. Intimate atmosphere, great parking, and location. I would recommend to anyone in the area. Beef broccoli is my fave!"}
{"text":"Your standard Chinese restaurant. Everything was breaded great, and the sauces weren't overwhelming, balanced pretty well. Waiting staff wasn't that great, lagged a lot on helping us. Quite a few instances where we were waiting on them for several minutes to clean our table. Thai tea was really sweet, and even as a Thai tea lover, I didn't drink more than a couple of sips. I would get the orange chicken, cashew shrimp, sweet and sour chicken (I believe), and pork fried rice again if I were to come back."}
{"text":"I enjoy getting takeout delivered to your door always fresh and hot and prices are out of this world cheap"}
{"text":"only reason they're getting 1 star is because by default you have to rate one Star.


I've been to this restaurant 3 times the first 2 times i visited i was really pleasantly surprised.  i ordered the combination fried rice which was great.  However today i placed my order and went to pick my order up.  When i arrived there i the person handing me my order the same person that last 3 times i went gave me my food.  i was like i ordered the large order of combination fried rice he proceeds to tell me that is the large in a little rice take out box.  i said the last 2 times I've ordered this i was given it in the large take out box.  he said that it's the same size when clearly they were two different sizes.  I let them know that they're crazy I'm not paying $8 for a smaller portion than i usually get.  so needless to say that i can celled my order and will no longer go there since they want to rip people off.  Don't change your sizes depending on how you're feeling,  Off to find another Chinese restaurant to get great fried rice!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews...its not mind-numbingly, transcendental, change-your-life Chinese food (you may have to go to Beijing or at least San Francisco for that), but its great for the price and when you're looking for something fast.

I haven't tried most of their menu, but I've been to this place sporadically since I was a little kid (they've definitely been around at least since I moved here in the late 90's) and I love their egg drop soup.  

Their pad thai is my favorite dish, although when you're there, ask for \"spicy noodles\", as that's what they call it.  Very generous portion for the price, so much noodles that I'm almost afraid the white styrofoam take-out box will split in half.  I also liked their Kung Pao Shrimp, which is far superior to Panda Express' similar offering, and also cheaper for the size.

I did not like the Kung Pao chicken, however, it seemed as though the chicken they used was not that great.  

All in all, their spicy noodles are excellent and enough to satisfy two people for an evening.  Great quick meal when you don't have time to cook."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE This place was horrible -- we arrived at 9.00 pm and they gave us a table. A lady came to take our order but BEFORE greeting us she made an ugly face and told us in a bad mood than they were closing at 9.30 pm, I was asking questions about veggies in some dishes, after answering 1 or 2, she said we needed to hurry up as they were closing in 20 minutes refusing to answer additional questions. Every time we asked for something she kept saying \"we need to close at 9.30 pm\"; she was nasty and awful, NOTHING close to nice or polite, she made us feel we just came to bother her and her family business; finally at 9.25 pm she basically kicked us out of the place.  AS COSTUMERS WE FELT HUMILIATED AND WE WILL NEVER RETURN. This lady (the only female we saw as waitress working there) was really despotic! When leaving, a male said happy holidays to us, the other males were OK, the only horrible one was this female, more than enough to never go back. Just rating 1 star because there is no option for none. Please eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"When I want Chinese food this is where I come. Once upon time I lived in this area but not anymore but that doesn't stop me from coming back. I love their combination fried rice I order it every time. Also their coconut chicken is the best. Service is always fast and friendly. I've never waited more than 15 minutes for my food which I think is great considering usually I'm ordering 4 or 5 dishes and lots of sides. Location is good when cheyene isn't being ripped up by construction. Portions here are huge so plan to feed an army if you walk out of here with more than one or two dishes. Price is always great here I've never spent more 60 or 70 bucks despite ordering half the menu. So next time slip panda express and give this place a try I bet you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as we entered and they got to our order right away. We have been looking for a Chinese spot that's on this side of town that's more authentic. The pork fried rice tasted really good and didn't need to be doctored up with soy sauce. We also ordered lettuce wraps with some kind of chicken.  They prepare their food fairly quick, so or to go order didn't take that long. It's small and surrounded by several other choices for grub but ill stop by here again."}
{"text":"I'll admit the food is passable but that's it, add the lousy service when I went in to pick up the order my wife phoned in and I'm never going back. I'll drive an extra few miles for good service."}
{"text":"This place has good, not amazing, but good food. Ordering is easy and quick, delivery is prompt, prices are very reasonable. A nice atmosphere for dining in, too. Again, not amazing, but comfy and clean. I especially like the war wonton soup."}
{"text":"Great place and great customer service. There food is really good too, my favorite Chinese food place in Vegas. Fast delivery, I don't eat pork and they always get my order right. Also they always give me extra fortune cookies for my kids"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give this place another chance since it is under new management. The food was very good, it was flavorful and the staff were very tentative as well. I will definitely continue to be back."}
{"text":"I would have given this place four stars given that the food is pretty good, they deliver, and are close to us. However, my latest encounter, which was last then 10 minutes ago, was what brought the star level down. 
I placed a phone order for delivery (I usually do it online but I wanted a boba drink so I called it in instead because they dont have the drinks online). Let me replay the part of the conversation that made me angry...
Me:\"Can I have a boba drink too?\"
Person on the phone:\"Yeah, you can have one. What do you want. \" (in a serious/annoyed voice)
Um. Wait. What?  That's not how you talk to a customer. I should've cancelled my order at that moment. But whatever, I guess my boyfriend and I will find other places close by. I actually liked this place but never again."}
{"text":"I tried Cook On Wok after receiving one of their promotional menus at my home.  I decided to have them deliver.  The food arrived after a decent wait.  We had pork fried rice, pepper steak with steamed rice, cream cheese won tons, and barbecued pork strips.  We thoroughly enjoyed the won tons, the pepper steak, and the steamed rice.  We thought the pork fried rice was absolutely delicious.  We weren't impressed with the barbecued pork strips.  Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be eating from Cook On Wok again."}
{"text":"Parking right out front. 
Great lunch special. Kung pao chicken,  fried rice, egg corn soup and egg roll. For $5.50. Since this review was started the lunch special prices have increased but still a good deal for chinese in the area. Food good amount and quality and service was medium. 
Restaurant is clean . 
Good deal worth trying for lunch. Will come back."}
{"text":"Raw noodles.  Unfriendly staff.  Just that simple"}
{"text":"Love this place. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for over 8 years. Food has always been great and the service is wonderful. They are from China and don't make small talk unless you want to a speak in Chinese.
If you have special orders they will make any changes you would like. Not so spicy, extra snow peas. The lunch specials are the best in town and they include soup if you dine in. This restaurant is the American version of Chinese food. It is not PF Chang's or fusion. China a go go's food is bland. 

Thank you cook on wok your delivery service is great."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was a great surprise! The food was outstanding, service excellent and very clean. We have found our new Chinese food eatery!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. No, it's not OMG it's amazing chinese food, but it's pretty solid. Lunch specials are cheap cheap cheap, and when you ask for something to made spicy, they actually make it spicy. The salad they serve is simple, but made very tasty with the dressing they use. The egg drop soup has corn in it, which adds a nice touch. Oh, and the Mongolian beef is made spicy instead of sweet, oddly enough."}
{"text":"Great food.  Pleasant service.  Fresh every time.  Wonderful  delivery service."}
{"text":"The crab ragoon, the egg rolls and the generals chicken were certainly not the best I've ever had. There was little too no sauce on the general chicken so was dry especially when I added the rice."}
{"text":"The food taste fresh and is really good.  I always get the singapore style noodles and shrimp fried rice.  No silverware in my to go bag the last couple of times so I had to wait to get home to eat."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! The rice tastes weird and the items we ordered were just mediocre. Not authentic whatsoever. Will not come back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for lunch because its so close to campus and the food is cheap. 
Its not a bad value at all if you're craving westernized style Chinese food-- certainly better than the crap you'd get at panda express or other fast-food chinese. The owner is a somewhat friendly Chinese immigrant who recognizes his regulars. The egg roll is a tasty greasy spring roll that comes with that comforting sweet n sour sauce. The egg drop soup is tasty with hot sauce but I absolutely love their hot and sour-- feels great when you've got a sore throat or allergies acting up. I've had just about everything on the menu. The Mongolian beef is tasty but a bit chewy. The cashew chicken isn't bad but I much prefer the Kung pao chicken. The orange chicken here tastes familiar to the Chinese food fan but is still considerably better than your average fast food fare. I recommend  the house special chicken which has the sweetness of orange chicken but the added spice of sauteed red peppers and some vegetable. The fried rice here is nothing to write home about so I usually opted for the white for health preferences.  The portions are rather generous here so expect to be stuffed everytime you eat lunch here. Green tea goes well with the meal and is pretty cheap.
I really don't suggest you come here expecting an amazing dinner-- its more of a casual lunch spot. Its far from original or innovative but don't knock it till ya try it. They certainly won't blow you away but they just might convince you to come back.

[Edit: I've heard that the ownership and management has recently changed here, and I haven't eaten here in at least 10 months. It is possible that my experiences are not an accurate representation of what you may get here. Just a disclaimer.]"}
{"text":"We had jalapeño Chicken and Shrimp and Moo Goo and it was great!!!! They told us 45 minutes for delivery and they delivered in 30 minutes. The food was wonderful!!!! Clark"}
{"text":"Too much soy sauce in the fried rice. I hate this place my husband loves it. I love fried rice so the first time we order I order my staple Chinese take out order chicken fried rice and egg roles. I hated the rice and actually really like the egg roles. But $3.25 for two egg roles kinda pricy. The chicken in the rice was too chewy and again way too much soy sauce. The second time we ordered there I got shrimp fried rice light on the soy sauce. It was actually really yummy. When we ordered a third time I said light on the soy sauce and they put the normal amount. Fried rice shouldn't look like brown rice.  On the plus side my husband likes the house special chicken which is general tsaos. Too spicy for my liking but he loves it. And I suffer from too much soy sauce.....Sigh."}
{"text":"This place is very, very good.  Booth seating is plentiful and comfortable.  The staff is very polite and attentive.

The Sesame Chicken was crunchy, not over fried, very flavorful and light.  The Beef Pepper steak is very flavorful and plentiful.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp is sooooo good you really should this dish."}
{"text":"Oops - wrote this review in Oct of '11 and forgot to post it.  Haven't been back since though . . .
10/2011 -- Wow, a year ago I would have rated this place 4 stars but my second experience with new owners is worse than the first. To start, over the last 5 years I have ordered from CoW probably 100 times. I have tried many different dishes but a staple ordered every time was Spicy Noodles, a chef specialty. The delivery guy before new ownership (probably the owner , he seemed invested and was there EVERY time I ordered and handled the phone, deliver, and packaging when I did take out) was the kindest person I have ever had deliver to me. He was over so many times while I was pregnant he asked to see the baby after my son was born. And when we ordered after that he would joke about if Gibson was ready for Orange Chicken yet. Great rapport. I wish I knew his name. I would order from any restaurant he was involved in. 
Enter new owners. I feel weird giving one star for a place I liked for so long, but my last experience went from bad to worse. 
1st was the delivery. After 1 hour 15 minutes I finally called and the answer was pretty rude (keep in mind the online quote for time was 45-60 minutes and past experiences with CoW had been timely).  15 minutes or so later I got a call from delivery saying she was lost and asking for directions. This frustrates me because basically every computer and phone are geared with GPS capabilities. Seems ridiculous for delivery people not to use those tools since that is their business.  This is horrible, but I was actually pissed that my boyfriend gave her a +25% tip (which is generally our m.o.- our delivery peeps love us). 
2nd the food. Quality wasn't horrible but the comparison was miles apart. Spicy Noodles had NO meat of any kind.  This dish formerly had chicken, shrimp and pork so it was a disappointment to have none. Then the crab won tons, another staple with Chinese take out in my opinion. They were over fried and therefore hollow inside. All the filling had been blown out in the fryer so we basically got charred won ton wraps. Both my boyfriend and I had dishes we have had before, me with Hot Braised Tofu and him with the staple Chicken and Broccoli and both were not great and definitely not the flavor and quality we had in the past.  I'm eating the Hot and Sour soup today fir lunch but don't have high hopes after my experience so far. Not to mention they no longer send strips withe the soups which I thought added a great crunch to a nice hot soup. 
All in all extremely disappointing. I have a hard time giving a restaurant I once loved a single star but the new owners should not be able to maintain the same name. They obviously have a new chef and the friendly staff is gone. If any one if the following had been positive I wouldn't have been so harsh but every aspect was a flop;  customer service, delivery, food ingredients, food quality . . . I can't think of one positive thing.  Bummer, I now need a new Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now in the past month. Both times we have had the lunch special which includes soup, entree, eggroll, and rice for $5-$7. You get plenty of food for your money. The staff are nice and the place is clean - though not fancy.

I had the Mongolian beef the first time and it was good. I tried the twice cooked pork the 2nd time and I'll definitely get that again next time."}
{"text":"In my family, we call this place \"Grease on Wok\". Barely edible."}
{"text":"We ordered Orange Chicken, Beef Lo Mein, Teriaki Chicken and a few other things. Bill was 50 bucks and when it got to the house we opened it and was the Lo mein and had some odd veggie thing and an extra white rice and no pork rice. The orange chicken was soggy and I ordered the large but was less than what you get in a small. Not happy. I will stick with Chop Chop Wok by the 95 and Cheyenne."}
{"text":"Even though most of the reviews for this restaurant aren't good, I decided to take a gamble and try it out anyways... And I'm very glad I did! It's literally walking distance from my office which is also a plus. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken Lunch Special for 
$5.95. It came with hot and sour soup. For the price, it was a large portion. Most importantly, it was delicious! Nice service as well. I will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Their server is very friendly. Food is priced good and have good lunch specials. I especially liked the lemon chicken and Mongolian beef.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  Chicken curry was tasteless soup the same. NEVER again"}
{"text":"Portions are small and not a lot of meat. Mongolian beef was kinda chewy and fatty. Asked for egg drop and got chicken corn soup. Not the same thing. Asked for the crisps that go with the soup and guy says that's extra 0.65. No napkins or silverware. Really?? Won't be back. First impressions are everything."}
{"text":"Service staff is friendly. They start you off with fried wonton wrappers and hot and sour sauce for dipping. I'm not 
sure if it's because I'm in the southwest now and everyone figures you must have a version of chips and salsa to start, 
but I wasn't a fan. 

They sent us out free egg rolls which were a nice touch, but the egg rolls were not tasty. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken
and my husband the pork lo mein (spicy). They sent mine out spicy and his mild. The food itself was just not 
as good as it could've been. 

I will give them credit on the hot and sour soup, but the wonton soup was overly seasoned. 

With so many options in this area I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place out. Not too bad. Got sesame chicken and egg rolls.  One day I will find real egg rolls in this town, but this is not the place. Sesame chicken wasn't bad, but not great. Service was super fast and friendly. Will go here again, but won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Food tastes authentic and prices are cheap. Customer service is good as well. The place is pretty clean. Lunch special is the best, you get lots for your money. When we crave chinese food this is the first place we think of."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden Gem. The food is great, fresh, the help is very friendly and attentive. It is right in the middle of Stephanie between the 215 and the Galleria Mall.  We found it by accident and it is the BEST Chinese food we have found in Nevada. This is a must!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery! Chicken Dan Dan Noodles are wonderful and tasty. Used a coupon and got 6 free crab wontons. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the orange chicken and egg rolls!! Also the service is always great! Oh and the crab Rangoon are amazing!! Except I get it without crab so it's like a cream cheese wonton and I love them."}
{"text":"Walnut shrimp!! Best Chinese, always happy when I dine in or order to go. Best value!"}
{"text":"My last trip here, I ordered 2 items, chicken fried rice & curry chicken.  I actually liked the chicken fried rice quite a bit.  However, the Curry Chicken, ordered extra spicy, was a huge disappointment.  I disliked the item so much, I actually deleted their number from my contacts.

Mainly, the curry chicken tasted stale & the chicken was almost gelatin it was so soft.  I am, typically, not a waster, but I threw this dish out.  I know that chicken takes on the flavor of the sauce you cook it in, but, in this case, it took on the staleness of the curry.

This is sad, because, for years, I came here ordering their Lo Mein.  Then I left the area for a while.  This foray was after a year or more since my last visit.  All things change, entropy is always in effect, and all good thing must come to an end, I guess (cliché riddled rant now over).

I may give it another try, but would be hard pressed to do so."}
{"text":"Change in management is a terrible thing!   Used to love coming here, but gross, what happened?  You can't even get service without waiting at the counter 5 minutes while folks in the back pace back and forth on dirty floors and scowl in your general direction.  And there is smoke EVERYWHERE!  I mean greasy choking cooking smoke, making you gag.  

And if you are dining alone, or picking up an entree for one, and I wouldn't recommend dining in, bring the cash.  They let you know in no uncertain terms, by like 50 signs pasted around the place that they won't take credit/debit under $10.  The ratio to Asian art and these signs is like 1 to 50.  

The food has changed too.  Bad, is all I have to say.  And they got rid of the smoothies.  

Won't go here anymore."}
{"text":"Try the Pork Lo Mein, Crab Rangoon and the Won Ton soup. 
Service great, but I only get take-out. 
Made fresh and it's hot and yummy."}
{"text":"I don't get the awful reviews for this place, I think it's okay. The service was TOP NOTCH and SUPER FRIENDLY, but we were one of only two tables that had customers in the whole place. 

I was scared to try it after reading the Yelp reviews but I was inticed by the restaurant's giant red and white banner hanging outside that screams \"Low Carb Chinese Food.\" I think the only thing low carb about it is if you don't eat the gargantuan pot of white rice that comes with your dinner, but the food was decent. The hot tea is really good and they would refill it (including a fresh tea bag) as much as you wanted.

The meat quality was particularly good, the chicken dishes use all white meat chicken breast. The atmosphere is like a Denny's stuck in 1981, but that only adds to the \"charm\" of the mirrored walls and fake plants. I dig it!"}
{"text":"I order delivery nearly every time. They always say 30 - 45 mins but always arrive in 20mins. Over the phone they it can be a little bit of a challenge.

I've eaten lunch a few times and it isn't that bad. Semi clean and the service is par.
The combo fried rice is pretty good with most chicken dishes not too bad.

Look this place isn't a 5 star restaurant but they do serve you the food you need at the time, and in time."}
{"text":"We are finally starting to get to know our Vegas neighborhood, so we decided on this trip to only choose to eat in our area.  Since we were feeling Chinese, we stopped in here.  SO GLAD we did.  The food is really good.  You can taste the fresh in every bite.  Veggies are crispy, sauces are so tasty and the know how to cook shrimp.  I LOVE when shrimp is not over cooked.  We ordered the Schzechuan Shrimp and it was delicious.  The Pepper Beef, delicious lot's of beef and loaded with crunchy bell peppers.  The house fried rice is really good.  We didn't care for the twice cooked pork, I found the pork chewy and not very tasty.  Their eggrolls were on point as were their cream cheese wontons.

AND THEY DELIVER.. : )"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time and have loved it just as long. My fave is the dressing from the salad. The owner makes it himself from scratch. The Mongolian beef is one dish i get everytime as it's always consistent . I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dining at a Chinese restaurant while visiting my grandma has become a bit of a tradition.  Usually it is a place near her house in California when I visit.  Yesterday though, my grandma was in Vegas and I took her to a place near my home.  Cook On Wok.  This is a place I had been to one other time and enjoyed then.  My grandma and I enjoyed it yesterday.  For $5.25 you get a cup of soup, a salad or egg roll, the entree and rice.  It is good food and a good price considering it is a small sit-down restaurant.  I ordered Orange Flavored Beef.  It was very saucy with a strong citrus and spice taste to it.  I believe I detected cinnamon.  Orange and cinnamon is a good combo.  There was also some candied orange peel in the dish.  Very good.  My Grandma ordered Beef Pepper Steak.  This was tender beef with a good gravy and flash cooked bell pepper and onion.  The vegetables were still crisp.  Love it.  With our entrees and a shared pot of green tea the bill came to a very reasonable $12.85.    I plan to go back when I need a good laid-back Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We have tried lots of Chinese in northwest area, this one so far is the best. Nothing beats east coast Chinese to be honest but this is the best we have found in area :) need more chicken portion in lo mein order tho to be honest :)"}
{"text":"enjoyed moo goo gai pan with extra chicken and steamed rice!  Veggies fresh and crispy and chicken goist and tender.  Will return in Sept 2010."}
{"text":"Ordered late night...loveddd it! I highly suggest getting the chow mien with Mongolian beef! It's very affordable and tantalizing!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times in the past few months!! Food is a lot better, dining room redone. A+ House Chicken has become my favorite dish there !"}
{"text":"RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!! The cashier actually threw packets of soy sauce instead of handing it to me. Then mumbled some Asian language in about me to the other workers. Just because I wasn't paying attention to her when my pickup number was called. I place I will never return to. Check to see if they spit in your food. VERY BAD SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Descent food, nothing special. I didn't like the fact they use part of their dining area toward the restroom as storage. Everything was alright but the fact that the waiter didn't come back and check on me if I needed anything else. As it turned out, I did. Some hot sauce, didn't feel like getting up from eating so I ate without."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering here and I really like their food. I just wish they add more yummy sauce on their ChowMein which is the spaghetti noodle kind. I feel like it's really dry because the noodles would soak all the sauce in. Other than that it's a must visit & order anything in the menu."}
{"text":"Had delivery this evening and really enjoyed the food. It showed up on time and the quantity was just right."}
{"text":"We ordered sesame chicken, combination fried rice, and Mongolian beef. Friendly staff and we ordered pickup when we went in and received our food very fast.

-sesame chicken was delicious. Fresh, crispy, and the sauce made it great.
-combination fried rice was also delicious. Great amount of shrimp pork and chicken. Very flavorful and not dry.
-Mongolian beef was just ok. Way more green onions and peppers than beef but the flavor was good."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the service we received. Upon entering we were merely directed to a table and provided no menus. The host simply walked back to his stand. We sat and chatted, waiting for a waiter to at least bring us some menus. The delay took excessively long. We watched the workers talk in the back, only to have one person to run 1 thing out at a time. The place wasn't busy, it was a Wednesday around noon, so I can't attribute the flaw in service to being overwhelmed.  The waiter finally came to our table to take our drink order. We stated we had received no menus and, being new to the restaurant, had no idea what drinks were available. He stated he would get us menus after he got our drinks, ignoring our previous statement. We restated it, and the host rustled up some menus. The waiter then walked away to another table before giving us a chance to place drink orders at least. Overall the experience just felt very rude and we perceived it as them blatantly ignoring us. We proceeded to leave thereafter due to the poor service. Again, I have no opinion of their food because thr service was bad enough to cause us to leave before even ordering. Hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"Most everything I have had here is OK, not great, but OK.
I do like the chicken lettuce wraps, and their egg rolls are pretty good too.
Most of the spicy dishes aren't very spicy at all. The kung pow chicken has very little spice, I usually have to fix it up with some hot sauce, but the flavors are good. I also like the shrimp and garlic sauce.
I have only ate in the restaurant once, the service was good. I usually get delivery, the deliveries are always quick and convenient!"}
{"text":"Long wait to get food for a slow night.  Food is over pricing for the quality of food and atmosphere.  Service not so bad, but I have to call for refill on my drinks, wait stuff didn't even bother to ask if everything was ok.  Restroom is dirty, does does the hallway to the kitchen.  Stuffing for the egg rolls was left an attended on one of the tables.  I don't think they will past my health code.  I don't think O will ever come back there again.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"A Fan of their SHRIMP CHOP SUEY 

   When it comes to Cook on Wok:s shrimp chop suey, my taste buds say, \"Baby, your the greatest!\" Well, maybe not the greatest. I am still trying Chinese restaurants throughout the Valley. Regardless, my taste buds elevate Cook on Wok's shrimp chop suey to the 4 star yelposphere. 

  I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. In my opinion they are a better value than a fast food restaurant. The Cook on Wok lunch specials include an entree (see my photo), crunchy noodles with duck sauce, white or fried rice, and soup of the day where an additional $2 upgrades to wonton soup. Their wonton soup is over and above the typical wonton soup that includes shrimps. On the other hand, I also enjoyed their hot and sour soup (included). The lunch special menu trails behind several Chinese restaurants in variety. After eating their SHRIMP chop suey, I am decided on ordering it when I done here. Although, the plate is not overflowing with food, it is flowing with the delicious ingredients of shrimp chop suey. Cook on Wok is generous with the number of shrimps. Every bite is delicious from the shrimp and vegetables down to the broth. With the lunch special I order a Coke that they serve in a generous size glass. Before the tip, the total adds up to approximately $12.

 Twice in recent times, I have made the right turn from Warm Springs Road into the Circle K parking lot at the southeast corner of Stephanie Street and parked in the adjacent parking lot to dine in Cook on Wok. Upon walking inside, the friendly gentleman walks me to the table a few minutes before becoming my waiter. The atmosphere is one of a dine in Chinese Restaurant instead of a take-out. It is a clean and relaxing environment. 

  I recommend Cook on Wok for their shrimp Chop suey lunch special. I support this recommendation with my signature of four stars."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot but since they've changed management in the past few years it's gotten worse. The food is hit and miss and there is usually something messed up in the delivery orders. Not the worst but not great. Bring Jimmy back it was amazing when he was manager."}
{"text":"I am reposting this review that I posted on the Cook on Wok restaurant review page as this is obviously the same restaurant but just re entered with a #3 after it.

First off I will agree, the staff are friendly.  That is pretty much all this restaurant has going for it though.  Never having eaten here, my husband and I decided to give it a try for takeout.  We were told 10 minutes on a to go order which ended up taking about 25 minutes.  Seriously 3 other people placed to go orders, received their food, and left in the time we waited.  The staff was very apologetic and threw in an order of egg rolls for free in spite of the fact that we had not complained at all about the wait time.  So service is good, but what really counts is the food.  I really had a good idea when we unpackaged the meal and took out the glow in the dark pink sweet and sour sauce.  If a restaurant is going to serve over processed, sub par condiments there isn't much hope for the food.  The egg rolls were extremely greasy and rather tasteless.  The pork fried rice was over all rather bland and had a previously frozen quality to it.  Nothing tasted remotely fresh.  Finally the coconut chicken we ordered was inedible.  The chicken was stringy and so hard you could not stab it with a fork let alone chew it.  The sauce again appeared to be processed but since we couldn't eat the chicken it was hard to really gage it's quality.  To sum up we paid over $20.00 for some rice that tasted like what my mom used to make from a box in the 70's and greasy egg rolls.  We could have gone down the street to Panda Express for half the price and twice the quality.  Pretty sad when the fast food option is better than the sit down."}
{"text":"FINALLY a goddamn Chinese Food place that delivers. I've been asking for 2 years for one that delivers, especially in my area... and now I've finally gotten my wish... 

To top it off? Their food is GOOD. This place took the place of the recently deceased Pick Up Stix, which I will definitely not miss... (Sorry, shitty chinese fast food is not my idea of tasty... this goes for all the ones in the area... Pei Wei, Pick Up Stix and especially Panda Express...) 

The restaurant is quaintly decorated. Not too extravagant or flashy. Their food is VERY afforable, and they have smaller portions for take-out or delivery if you desire. There are plenty of lunch specials, along with options for children as well. The place is VERY clean inside, and is much better than the former business in that space. 

They have a minimum order amount for delivery of $15. There is a $3 service charge and a 4 mile radius. The hours there are Sunday-Thursday 11-9:30, and Friday-Saturday 11-10.

The owner Bob even came out and greeted my bf and I while we were eating. I let him know I'm definitely impressed and will be referring business to him from all my friends and neighbors in the area. 

Also, for those of you who dislike MSG. This place does not use any in their food."}
{"text":"I do not know why this place has such a low rating. I love this place, the food is great the portions are more than generous, they use white meat chicken, and the service is attentive. Also, the prices are very cheap, $5.50 and $6.50 for lunch is perfectly acceptable. They will change the heat level for any dish and make special arrangements for you. I wanted honey walnut shrimp with chicken instead of shrimp and they did not bat an eyelash they just said no problem. I also like that the plain lo-mein is truly plain, no vegetables or anything. Really give this place a try, and for other posters who have not been here in a while, you may reconsider coming back to this place. The decor is a little odd, 50's Chinese diner chic? Kind of strange but who cares? The place is good, clean, cheap, and the service is good. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Thought I would try something new, but I will stick to my restaurant.  

They have great service - greet you at the door, and are attentive when placing your order. I ordered pad Thai, which maybe was not a good choice.

It was very bland.  Very, very bland. So much so I had to throw it back in the fire, add some of my own stuff to add some flavor.  Never had I done that before, but I guess there's a first for everything.  My mom enjoyed her food though.  Maybe it was just my food, but that was my first time there, and not a great food experience.  I'll give it a shot one more time.  Based upon some of the other reviews, the food is good, so I'm willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Flavorless lo mein and almost out dated beef (it tasted and smelled funny). Shrimp friend rice was edible but not the next day. The egg drop soup had a metal flavor to it like it had been canned for years =P"}
{"text":"We've tried this place 3 times .. and each time the only food worth ordering again was the soup ..

Everything comes in the same funky brown sauce .. Pork Chow Mein, Shrimp Garlic, Cashew Chicken ..

No thanks we'll keep looking there's gotta b something better."}
{"text":"Food is alright, nothing extraordinary. Service is not really memorable, other than you having to ask for utensil every time you order food to go. It should be curtesy to always have at least a fork in the bag."}
{"text":"Fresh, inexpensive, delicious Chinese food! Even makes me feel like I'm eating healthy with all of the fresh veggies they throw in. My favorite is the Kung Pow chicken. Again, very fresh tasting! White meat! Couldn't ask for anything better! Very polite staff also :) Lunch specials can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I've only had delivery. I always get pepper steak and my fiancé gets general tso. We always get the egg rolls but I'm not a fan. Usually delivered within 45 mins. It's good but I prefer China one now that that is open. Prices are cheap and when u want something delivered it's convenient."}
{"text":"Look, I'm not saying search this place out.  I'm not saying \"THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN THE WORLD!!!!!\"  No no no.  I'm saying that if you live in this area, this is the best take out Chinese around.  If you want a delicious take out meal delivered to your house, or you want to pick it up, go here.  I've been to a couple of the other take out joints in the area and they stink.  No really they actually smell.   This place is good, has a variety of food, and is decently priced.  Don't believe these cranky reviews from people about how horrendous there hot and sour soup is.  This is good take out.  Don't leave the strip for it, don't drive from Henderson for it, but if you are in the area HIT IT UP!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. The usual fare, I had the Mu Shu Pork really good even the crapes that come with it were good. My husband had the mixed fried rice and really liked it to.  We also got the vegie and chicken spring rolls and egg rolls they were hot and tasty not too greasy. The price is good and the food is filling, very nice people that work there. Is it China Town great no, but for a local place is was good."}
{"text":"Even thou i have became a food snob over the years i still cannot forget how i would eat at this place all the time. It was prolly because you got your money worth and i was a student at the time. I usually come during the lunch for their specials.. you had the choice of egg drop soup or hot and sour soup then they give you a salad then your entree.. i would suggest teriyaki chicken or the lemon chicken .. I would recommend this place if your on a budget.. nothing to fancy but will fill you up for sure! staff are very friendly there.. just sad to say i dont eat this kind of food anymore.."}
{"text":"Friendly and great food with the freshest ingredients. Ask for Tony, he will get you Fried Rice or Chow Mein made New York style."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant that delivers to my house.
It's got the basic menu and they're more than willing to augment a dish to suit your preferences.
For example, I like Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is not normally spicy, but I ask them to spice it up, and they comply.
They have family specials, but on those, they are not too keen on changing the choices.
They deliver really fast, and have never made me wait more than 15 or 20 minutes for delivery.
I would recommend ordering from the regular menu, and stay away from the family specials.
They may seem like they're a good deal, but I don't like when my choices are made for me.
I love their pot stickers (although they are pretty expensive), and I like their beef and broccoli, War Wonton soup, and spicy shrimp w/vegetables.
The food is pretty good, and the delivery is fast, but the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat the whole family enjoys coming here or taking out. Tonight we had take out and was made very fresh and always good. Keep up the good work you have always been good to us you even know us by name. Awesome place awesome food."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back! The food was very good and the wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We had the vegetable egg rolls, sweet-n-sour pork and the vegetable Lo Mein. Everything was cooked fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here every once in a while. We usually have it delivered and it always arrives fresh and hot and the people that work there are always super friendly. We are picky with Chinese food and we enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I've only gotten delivery,  which is always super fast. It's easy to order on the eat 24 app.  Delivering staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This was very mediocre delivery Chinese food. The typical fat-laden goopy crap you see everywhere. They do deliver, which is great.. but so do many others. I didn't particularly enjoy anything I ate... I had some sort of orange chicken and a mongolian beef.. but just very *eh*. My fiance thought they were ok, so I'm bumping it up from the 2 stars I'd give it."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally be able to get Chinese food delivered! It's made to order, so it's nice and fresh when it comes to you. The portions for the price are pretty damn good! For $23.95 before tax, we got 2 orders of soup, 4 fried wontons, 2 egg rolls, 2 good sized main dishes, 2 cartons of white rice, and 1 carton of chicken fried rice. I also got an order of egg foo young, which was so tasty! Because we spent over $25, we also got a free order of California sushi rolls. They are quick with deliveries and the driver has been super nice both times we've ordered. We will definitely continue to order from there!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Cook On Wok.  We have passed this establishment many of times, but on a Friday night we decided to stop in and give them a try.  Inside had plenty booth seating and their staff is very polite in addition to attentive to the customers needs.  

During our visit we ordered the Orange Chicken, which was very \"orange\" in flavor, and the Beef and Green Peppers.  The beef was cooked great, it was not dry and their was more than enough for us to share and take home.  Along with our meal came egg drop soup, fried rice,  cream cheese wontons, and egg rolls.  Overall the food was good and their service was great.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"I prefer not to eat faux Chinese food but if I'm outnumbered and the majority votes for this place and I'm eating for free then, I don't have a choice. We get food here every so often since our office is in Summerlin. They cater/deliver. The ordering process can be tedious. Language barrier/ hearing problems? Whatever it is, it would take you at least 5 minutes to order over the phone.

The non-Asian folks normally eat sweet and sour chicken, Szechuan beef, crab rangoons, egg foo yong, veggie fried rice and, eggplant and tofu. Their only saving grace is the salt and pepper shrimp - mind you, I'm allergic to shellfish so you could say I'd rather die than eat here if it were up to me.

Yuppie chow fun!"}
{"text":"Good flavors, a little heavy on onions and peppers in the schezuan beef and Mongolian beef, could use a little more meat for the price. The pot stickers and spring rolls are good. They have kids meals, my kiddo like the orange chicken kids meal which includes white rice, broccoli and a couple of crab rangoo. This place is good overall."}
{"text":"Greasy and bland.  I had to raid my Asian sauce collection from the pantry to drown my food in multiple sauces to produce any noticeable flavor.  

I was on my way home and placed a call in order for delivery, using my credit card to pay.  Since the boyfriend was home to receive the order, this seemed like a wonderfully convenient idea, which I would later learn otherwise.  The delivery driver arrives and informs boyfriend, \"No card, no food.\"  They failed to advise of this little detail that the credit card and ID must be present and offered for review at the time and location of delivery, otherwise they will give you the food.  The delivery driver took the food back to the restaurant and informed boyfriend that I would have to drive there to pick up my delivery order and show them my credit card before they would release the order.  So, I go pick up my delivery order and ask for a refund of the delivery fee.  At this time they inform me that my card was already charged at the time of the order, also at the same time they could have informed about their policy that they won't deliver the food if the card isn't on location.  They couldn't figure out how to refund the delivery fee, so in my frustration I told them not to worry about it, as I decided that we would rather eat our food while it's still luke warm, rather than completely cold."}
{"text":"RIP Cook on WOK.

Now clearly a different owner/menu. Be warned, it is not the same."}
{"text":"Ordered from here quite a few times and always forget to write review. I've not been dissatisfied with the service or food from here. Ordered the General chicken, Pepper Steak, rice, hot/sour soup. Really easy ordering options online or call in. I've dined in and the old school vibe was definitely throw back 80's lol! White meat on the chicken and it can be spiced up to your liking. The pepper steak tasted fresh and vegetables combined produced a great flavorful  combination. I will venture into the seafood menu next time ordering. Very helpful and friendly when ordering, great customer service always helps!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it great food. I had lunch here and the wonton soup was good. The Orange flavored chicken was average or even a little less than average. The fried rice that came with it was.....well....it tasted like white rice. Looked similar to fried but was pretty boring too. 
I would compare the quality to panda express. Not great, but an acceptable alternative to fast food. Only downside to that is that you have a waitress you have to tip here. 
The dining area is odd, with boxes of supplies piled up on the right side of the entrance area. Makes it look cluttered and unfinished."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the lunch. Service was good. The young lady serviced us with a smile and promptness. We ordered the Salt and pepper Shrimp with house fried rice. The shrimp was served lukewarm at best as was the rice. The shrimp was plentiful and plump in both dishes, just not hot. The rice was a little drier than I like, but Okay. Overall will I return? Yes I think they deserve another  chance. It wasn't that bad"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few more times and other than the Orange Beef, I haven't been too happy here.  But the beef is so exceptional it still deserves three stars.  I may try some of the dishes that I had from Beijing Chinese Cuisine down the street to see how it compares."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the price is cheap ?especially lunch special ? and the owner is friendly ?and also he got a cute baby ... i will come again ?"}
{"text":"This place is good and very consistent. We've tried a handful of dishes from there and are never disappointed. Service is great, but we've only done takeout. The prices are really good too!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Cook On Wok in the past. Actually a long time ago and I believe it was good, but not this time. we had it delivered. It took a very long time, but my main complaint was the food. my husband got the pad Thai. he said it was the worst ever. the orange chicken was horrible too. the crab rangoos were smashed and not the best I've had. The only dish we got that was decent was the garlic chicken. I won't be returning or ordering again from here."}
{"text":"Basic bland Chinese.. Nothing memorable :( not a lot of meat in dishes and not worth the money :("}
{"text":"This is some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. My wife and I ordered the pork fried rice, and chicken lo mein only to be greeted with the greasiest, scummiest Chinese food I've ever had. The pork in the fried rice was spongy and fatty. The lo mein was weighed down with way too much oil. The price is fair but better suited for edible foods.

Once again, this is probably the worst Chinese food I've had, and if Chinese food is SO BAD it stands out as being worse than the worst, there is a real problem."}
{"text":"This place always delivers great food and really great service.  Sometimes I din in or even carry out.  The food is prepared quickly and is so good. I will always come back...enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food.  Wonton soup has shrimp and pork and chicken with vegetables in s clear broth with nice size dumplings.  The House Special Chicken is very good!! Sweet & Spicy white meat chicken pieces ($1.00 extra for white meat chicken), with steamed broccoli.  Asked them to put sauce in container of ordering for delivery so chicken does not get soggy.  The Walnut Shrimp is very good also.  The shrimp were nice sized, 21-26 ct., Sz., very nice and very good shrimp, with nice brown sauce and vegetables.  But, would not recommend the Shrimp Egg Foo Young.  The patties looked pre-made and sauce or gravy had the shrimp in it instead being in the patties? Otherwise, definitely one of our Favorite Chinese to go or delivery that is close by. Thank U for always being patient when placing order! Very patient because of so many different sauces, chow mein noodles, hot mustard and sweet & sour sauce that's fresh not in packets which they will Do!"}
{"text":"Food Poison that what I got when I went to eat here, Food was very poorly cook and taste was horrible. 
The services that we received less than one star but the lower you allow to rate this people is one star.
This place should be close down and the county should inspect this kitchen very well, I never got food poison before and within 10 minutes of eating here I was rush to the hospital."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Prices are very affordable. Usually order take here for lunch but today i came inside the resturant. Very friendly staff."}
