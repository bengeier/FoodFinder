{"text":"We have always enjoyed breakfast here, but they have recently begun serving dinner on Saturdays. Outstanding service and probably the best salmon salad I have ever eaten. Absolutely love this little place !"}
{"text":"Giving this place one star is saying much, the hostess was very rude, we waited like 15 min to be seated and she didn't even put are name on the list, told us to wait minute but as soon as another party showed up she went and took their name and help them. After that we just decided to leave and we will never come back or recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot near Wigwam resort . Nice relaxing outside dining available  with great views of Wigwam resort area . Fairly busy street but quite enough to enjoy your breakfast  Our group was impressed  with   service and  food .Pancakes I had were excellent  and would love to try lunch next time in town ."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say.  Wow!  This was the WORST restaurant experience that I have had in my 43 years on this earth.  I am not exaggerating.  It was very, very painful.  It started with the hostess.  A \"5-10\" minute wait was all, she said.  25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names.  OK, no problem, mistakes happen, we understand.  She says we get the next 2 person table.  Cool.  As we are waiting, I notice a couple being seated that came in much after us.  After some questioning, she allegedly crossed out their names too.  Umm, really???  The girl had no clue.  Finally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient.  OK, we are patient.  We order our food, a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich.  As we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting, we hear the waitress scolding customers.....\"I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer, you chose to wait.  Really????   At another table she says the same thing.  The table next to us, once they get their food, complain and leave without even touching it.  Oh my!!!!  Apparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd.  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above, took 70 minutes to get to us.....YES! 70 MINUTES!!!!!!!!  I can't believe we waited that long.  We were so mad, but at some point we were too invested.  Once the food comes.....no chips.  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet.  Really!!!!?????  The food was decent, no complaints there.  Every single table, though, was mad and upset about the wait.  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and I eat out A LOT!  Anyway, stay away from this place.  They don't deserve your business.  This, by the way, is also the first \"bad\" review I have ever written.. They should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"My godmother and I went to this restaurant on Monday. I created a Yelp account because of it. This place is amazing. The food is wonderful, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the overall ambiance is comfortable and warm. I don't know if a gentleman named Gilbert is the owner or the head chef, but he came out and gave my godmother and I and full history of the food they served, which was awesome. I truly appreciated the overall experience and the Park Cafe will be a restaurant that myself and my family will frequent. Do yourself a favor and go!!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot with simple outdoor seating. Excellent omelets with fresh ingredients. Panini sandwiches were very good. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal here tonight with four friends.  All of us were very happy with our paninis. I had the portobello mushroom which was incredible.  The serving size was great for the price.  Help was friendly.  Cute spot away from the big chain food places."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't even know what to rate this place right now. This was my second time here, great experience and great service. So I decided to take a relative and well yeah I felt pretty embarrassed because he found a hair in his food. Sad to know he won't come back, hopefully he changes his mind. All I can recommend is hairnets from now on to prevent this happening...  Thank you"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast, but with such a limited menu we won't become regulars. However, on our last visit I ordered coffee and the creamer on the table had gone sour and curdled. It took quite a while to get the waitress's attention and when we finally flagged her down she just brought me a little pitcher of milk. But left the spoiled cream on the table and didn't bring a fresh cup of coffee. Had to flag her down again and ask for a new cup of coffee and to please throw away the spoiled cream.  Finally, when we got our bill we were charged for a full order of the Hawaiian French toast when we ordered a side just to try it out - when I asked about it we were told there was no such thing as a side order so they just charged us the full amount. Expensive breakfast (and the coffee wasn't comped after all the hassle, surprisingly). Overall, we ended up paying around $45 for breakfast for two. We won't be back for quite a while - we have better luck at the chain up the street. We're bummed because we REALLY wanted to like it and support a local business as we go out for Sunday brunch every single weekend."}
{"text":"My family lives in Litchfield Park and like to spend our money with local vendors.  Our breakfast this morning couldn't have been worse.  The service was extremely slow, my breakfast was cold and they completely forgot my husband's order.  No one offered to take his breakfast off our ticket.  It amazes me this place does the business it does. I won't spend any more money at Park Cafe."}
{"text":"I love this new addition to Litchfield Park! I have eaten breakfast and lunch here. Their panini's are great!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 out of 5. Food was descend and the Presentation was good. Waiting time: 1/2 hr for seating Waiting time for food: 1/2 hr. It was manageable for me and my wife. I only have one issue with the staff members, they seem a little unorganized on managing customers waiting time for food. Two family was seated before me and my wife and we got served before them.  It was great that we got our food first but I can hear the customers complains on waiting time. One family waited a total of 2 hrs, she was really frustrated. God bless her heart . My recommendation, if you are really hungry, don't go."}
{"text":"Breakfast was yummy and bloody Mary's are the best!!! Waited a long time (30min), but food was worth it! Service was good!"}
{"text":"We visited park cafe today and we were impressed for the food quality and friendly service,  i had the goat cheese and chorizo omelete which was very delicious my mom had the south of the border steak omelette wich came with tomatillo red guajillo sauce, i got some of it it was very tasty we were told they have new breakfast menu everything  looks very healthy this is not an ordinary breakfast place ' their rainbow fresh potatoes are delicious . My friend ordered the blackened shrimp tostada salad wich she said it was great and very fresh honestly highly recomended if you are looking for heathy options at an affordable price."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast over the weekend (Sunday) at the cafe. We haven't been in a while and thought it was a nice morning to give it a go. There was a little wait, but we got sat shortly after. The girls seemed busy and didn't seem like they had much help. Our server was great and got our drinks out as quick as possible. The food was excellent when it came out. Our breakfast trip took a little longer than we had expected, but the service was excellent and the food was as good as we had remembered."}
{"text":"Was excited to eat at the nice little place.. After checking in it took an hour to be seated followed by an hour to receive our food:( food was fine, but couldn't make up for the ridiculous wait!"}
{"text":"Clearly a place that cares. Well prepared breakfast and delicious. Breakfast burrito with chipotle with your choice of meat .  A family friendly very pleasant place"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Very relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely come back when passing through."}
{"text":"The chorizo eggs Benedict is my favorite even though I'm from out of town. They usually only serve it on the weekends but made an exception for us today! Great, consistent, friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food was delicious and the prices and very reasonable. The service was incredible. I highly recommend it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"when my hubby and I were in search of a nearby place for brunch we were very excited to find Park Café. At first, we were charmed by the vintage urban décor. However charm was quickly replaced with disappointment when the staff was less than happy to see us there. We decided to stay anyways and give it a fair shot. I ordered the chipotle eggs benedict and my husband ordered the oatmeal whole wheat pancakes (sounds delicious, right?).   The food finally arrived. The pancakes were flat, flavorless and bitter.  My eggs benedict could have been great. The bread they used was soft and delicious the sliced deli ham was ok, but the sauce ruined all the potential this dish had. The traditionally creamy hollandaise sauce was replaced with a runny, brothy sauce that was very greasy. I couldn't get my self to eat half of my serving. The only good thing that was on my plate was the potatoes that came as a side. They were delicious, but I had to ask for condiments for them and our waitress seem annoyed by that.  Unfortunately we will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time visiting and a thank you goes to Yelp as this is where I found the recommendation.  We found the food to be excellent. The menu was well thought out with a lot of attention paid to each item on it. For example there were 4 different types of potato making up the wedges complimenting the Southwestern Omelette.   The manager who greeted us and acted as our server made a couple of mistakes and had to confirm our order, he could probably do with writing things down more, but these were rectified with speed and an honest apology.  My wife and I found the ambiance of the Cafe to be great. The inside is very characterful and the patio was inviting. The noise level was low enough not to have to struggle with our conversation.  All in all we had a wonderful meal there and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast. Enormous coffee cups filled with delicious, aromatic brew, and impeccable, friendly service. Unique, chef created sauces on South of the Border and Chorizo & Goat Cheese omelettes to die for. Yummy oatmeal & whole grain pancake instead of toast well worth mere $2 upcharge. Eating outdoors with a view of two lovely palm lined streets added to the joy of this experience. Our server, Adriana, was as lovely as the ambiance and three other staff helped to make sure we were happy. Highly recommended as the place to start your day!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Food is always fresh and delicious!   The staff is very friendly and accommodating always there to ensure your experience is welcoming."}
{"text":"First time here and the serve was horrible and my pancakes and bacon was over cooked."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.   My husband and I each ordered a burger. The burgers were good. We both got the southwestern green chile bacon burgers. I ordered mine without a bun and the homemade chips, my husband got his on a pretzel bun with fries. Both were made correctly. I also had an iced latte, it was so good and creamy tasting. We have never been disappointed with our meals here. I hope they start servicing dinner again soon."}
{"text":"The food was good. It just took an hour (not an exaggeration)  to get to us. So if you aren't in a hurry and have a deck of cards, coloring books (a family that colors together stays together) or a backgammon set it would be fine."}
{"text":"First timer a Sunday or two ago. We sat on the patio and it was moderately busy. My tuna melt (different name?) was delicious. My husbands Eggs Benedict was all kinds of good. Loved our fries! I remember coming here when it was Pueblo and wasn't overly impressed with breakfast.  This meal was different. It was nicely plated and scrumptious. Afterward we wandered over to the little farmers market in the much beloved litchfield park. Room for improvement-- it took us a bit to track down the waitress. We didn't see her much at all during our brunch and we had to track down hostess to pay our check and even that took some time.   Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We finally made it for breakfast after seeing such positive reviews, we go to Litchfield often for evening outings, thought we would check out breakfast. First thing we noticed is you walk in and no one acknowledged us, not sure to seat yourself or wait.  A couple of waitress's hustled by but never said anything.  After about 5 mins of standing around we asked a waitress about it, yah grab a seat- thats it.  ok, chalk it up to busy? not really maybe 5 tables with people eating.  We find a table, again sat for 10 mins before approached for drinks.  We ordered the traditional breakfast - once we got them, they were good.  But sitting for 40 mins for eggs, bacon and potatoes is a little much.  Not sure if this is normal or they were understaffed, our waitress never acknowledged how long we had been waiting for our food.  Since we arrived later in the morning we did see alot of lunch plates going out of the kitchen, may give them another try for lunch.   We always support local small business but the service today was very disappointing to an otherwise very cute restaurant.   We will try them again but not a fan today."}
{"text":"My family enjoys the Park Cafe. It's different than your typical food chain restaurant spot because their menu has a variety of choices to eat and drink. However, I will sadly only give them 3 stars because of the \"wait\".  Whenever we come to eat, we always call to check how long the seating wait is (It is typically an 45-60 minutes long) on Saturday's and Sunday's. But to receive your food after ordering is another story. The first visits made, we waited about 30-45 minutes long to get our food. However this last visit we waited one hour and 10 minutes......for only two omelet meals and 1 scrambled egg. Luckily our server empathized with us and gave us a discount.    In my opinion, the wait situation is a little ridiculous. I've been to other mom and pop restaurants where this isn't the problem.    The point: If you're hungry, willing to wait about 2 hours, and want a different kind of menu, then make the visit. If not, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice since my last review and have been pleased each time.  The portions are generous, the staff is friendly and attentive and they have a great selection of fresh things."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast.  Was staying across the street at the Wigwam. The spanish omelette was great -- steak, pico, onions, tomatoes... Service was very prompt and courteous. Great place for breakfast. The atmosphere reminds me of cafes in Austin, TX, not an upscale suburb of Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Something for everone. Service is quick. Family owned.  Best cafe for miles. They are now open for dinner. Burgers are juicy. Pizza is perfect. Oatmeal is creamy and amazing. A must try."}
{"text":"We gave this place a second chance because it's close to home & we like to support local. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment once again. Food is decent, but nothing is spectacular. Worst part of this whole experience is that we had to wait 35 minutes for our food to be served!!! This was about 10 mins quicker than our last experience so I guess you can say they're improving. Needless to say, we won't be back again..."}
{"text":"My family and I have been Sunday regulars for about a year after moving to Litchfield Park.  Let me say that the food is good, not great, but good.  The place is quaint and local, which is a nice change from the chain onslaught in this area.  For the last year the service has steadily declined.  Today was my family's last Sunday brunch for a while.  Our service extremely slow today.  It was no more crowded than usual but 30 min for my daughter's food to come out was way longer than usual.  She was done and more than ready to go before my food came.  I had my server box it up and paid as we'd been there pushing an hour.    I do like the place but the wait gets longer every time and the food wait gets even longer.  Seems the new wait staff isn't up to par."}
{"text":"What a cute place to enjoy some coffee and breakfast. The food came out fast and was delicious"}
{"text":"I stopped in for my first time today.  The breakfast burrito was fantastic!  I'll be back very soon.  Very kind staff and Adriana was very attentive.  Comfortable and a nice vibe------5 stars....."}
{"text":"The wait to be seated was ridiculous, the wait for our food was ridiculous and the wait to get the attention of a server was ridiculous. Expect to spend over an hour from the time you get there to the time you leave. The food was okay, definitely not worth the wait. I have been there before and never had an issue but this past time was beyond annoying."}
{"text":"In town for Spring Training. The girls just arrived and were starving. We came to Park Cafe on a recommendation from a friend. Did NOT disappoint!   We had the chilaquiles with and without chorizo, as well as the breakfast burritos one with chorizo, one with bacon and French toast. EVERYTHING was delicious. I wish I would have taken pics before we ate but I don't know that they would have done it justice.   D E L I C I O U S !!!  Just a heads up they do add gratuity to your bill (20%)  I recommend eating outside. The ambiance is so much nicer."}
{"text":"Great little corner spot. I love the Caprese sandwich and their signature chips.  But it's too much for me to eat alone. I've been here several times and found that it's best to split a sandwich. When you order, tell them you are sharing it and they will put it on  separate plates for you.   Always nice, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but every time I go, they're SO slow. Getting drinks...slow. Getting food... so super slow. Getting the check... slow enough that I've always had to go in and pay. If you're not in a hurry, great place but expect to be there for an hour and a half AT LEAST."}
{"text":"Their menu is amazing. We've gone there on several occasions, received excellent service. All servers are attentive, along with the Proprietor acknowledging each time we visit.  Food is amazing! It's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Had a great dinner with friends and family , amazing customer service Julio was very sweet and helped us explore the menu. Definitely a must for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"A great place for a tasty brunch / breakfast . The food and service are always great , didn't have to ask for much because staff was completely on top of everything . Food was excellent and the mocha I had was one of the best I've ever had ."}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to their pancakes...  And egg benedict so yummy! But they only serve egg benedicts on weekends! As a local, I totally recommend this place for your brunch get-togethers. Be ready for a long wait on weekends. But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"What to say about a cafe that makes delicious cuisine, amazing mochas and has super-terrific-yummy-delicious bacon? VISIT!  This was the last meal we had before heading back to the Golden State after our stay in AZ and it couldn't have gone any better.   The atmosphere inside definitely reminds me of a New York type establishment, yet I've never been to NY. The service was impeccable, very nice and accommodating to requests we had. The food was *muah*, deliciosa. I really don't have any words because it would not do it any justice, it me had and enjoyed. Allow your mouth to become engulfed in a festival of flavors that will leave you wanting more!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Amazing customer service, the coffee is okay. I've had better lattes! But the food is amazing. Definitely going to become my go to spot."}
{"text":"The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Coffee starts my day and in room coffee is normally an after thought at most resorts and the Wigwam nearby was no exception. Therefore, I headed out for a locally owned spot. This coffee was served in a giant beautiful cup and was rich and flavorful.  I wasn't out for a huge breakfast but it looks like the menu has omelettes to order and French toast, which sounded amazing.  There is outside seating too which for cold Midwesterners--- I appreciated! Bring on the sun."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I had the chilaquiles and they were spot on. For drinks I had an strawberry mimosa which wasn't that good at the beginning but the manager kindly fixed and was delicious afterwards! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"New favorite brunch spot.  Exceptional mimosas, mouthwatering chilaquiles, and fantastic desserts.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is okay....came here for the first time and got chilaquiles. It took foreverrrrrr. Way longer then it should have and it wasn't crazy busy. The server wasn't very good. She barley came to the table and the food was just okay. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! I love that I can bring my dog and sit in the patio area. The food is delicious I usually get the chilaquiles or huevos rancheros. Some people complain about the wait, yes it might take a little while to be seated and get the food especially during their busy hours but it's totally worth it, plus if it's always busy it just goes to show how great it is! :)"}
{"text":"Went here recently for lunch and the place was packed.  They were not ready for the number of people and it took a full hour for us to get our food.  The burgers were good and the homemade chips were quite tasty.  The chairs are the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever had the displeasure to encounter.  The business is new so make take time to get the kinks out.  But I would not sit in those chairs for another hour even for a free meal."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. We've been to the Park Cafe two Friday's in a row now. The staff is amazing (Summer waited in us both times) super friendly and if you need anything on the menu explained they will explain it.  The first time we tried the Chilaquiles which for me were a tiny bit too spicy but somehow I managed to devour the entire plate. (Nothing a little sour cream can't fix) My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and he enjoyed it as well. (He did say it had a kick as well.) The cafe mocha is nonetheless AMAZING.  The following Friday I had the breakfast burrito with bacon and it was also tasty and he had the \"special\" which was the Dulce De Luche French toast. He wasn't too fond of it simply because he said it was TOO sweet. But cmon it's in the title \"Dulce.\" ;) Our two year old toddler had the Mickey pancakes both times and I love the fact that they are whole grain. My cousin who was visiting from Cali had the Chilaquiles this morning and was in awe. She said we definitely have to bring her back next time she visits.  The Park Cafe is like a little hidden jewel tucked away in Litchfield. We love this place! It might just be our every Friday morning spot! :)"}
{"text":"This is now my favoritist place to come and eat! The flavors in the food are different and great. The atmosphere and setting is small yet roomy. The staff is great and attentive. Marisol was our server and there wasn't a dish she didn't recommend along with the drinks and she did not fail us. Gilbert is also quite the manager very attentive and involved with everything going on. We are always curious to know the ingredients in our eats and as simple as they are they make the dishes very flavorful we will definitely come back and try out more of what the menu has to offer. If your trying to stay away from ur typical Mexican/American dishes this is the place to come! The picture is chilaquiles with chorizo, huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"We were here for special function dinner. Fora catered event always put your best foot forward. Chip are good, salsa not exciting at all very bland.  Here's to hoping the meal is better. Food was not much better. Rice and beans good, cheese enchiladas and beef tacos ok.  Coke was really good.  Probably not a returney."}
{"text":"DH and I had lunch at the Park Cafe this past Sunday at about 11:30am and the place was packed to the gills with people.  Always a good sign that the place has good food!  :-)  Plenty of seating on the patio (with umbrellas provided for ample shade cover) and inside.  We were shown to a table as soon as we arrived, so that's another plus for them.  :-)  Even though the place was packed, the wait-staff were VERY attentive, kept refilling our glasses, and keeping us informed as to when our food would arrive.  Took a while to get our food, but that was to be expected on a Sunday brunch morning.  DH had their BLT on Hawaiian bread with their homemade malt vinegar potato chips (so good!) while I had their Portobello and Brie sandwich on a Ciabatta roll and some insanely delicious french fries (nice and hot).  Both sandwiches were delicious!  One thing I was expecting (especially with portobello mushrooms) involved was a soggy sandwich.  Pleasantly surprised that the ciabatta roll had been toasted and that most of the moisture had been cooked out of the mushrooms prior to them assembling the sandwich.  Just the right amount of mayo as well.  (If you can't tell, I'm NOT into soggy bread.)  DH and I have been to this location many times before.  First it was a coffee shop, then a restaurant that served American-style food and then a Greek restaurant.  This has to be my favorite so far and I hope they continue in business for a long, long time.  They're off the main roads and in the heart of Litchfield Park, so unless you actually go into the town, you might not realize this little gem of a restaurant exists.  That said.....spread the word people!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots. I always order the huevos rancheros and it is always fantastic! Great team service and food here!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Park Cafe.  I met a friend for brunch and we sat outside.  It was a little cold today but the had plenty of heaters going so we were very comfortable.  It was a little busy and the location is small so come early for be ok with waiting.  I ordered the Southwest Omlet with streak and a side of rainbow potatoes.  It was a good size plate of food so you def get your money's worth.  The food was too greasey for me.  The omlet filling was cooked with grease, grease on the omlet and deep fried potatoes.  Because they make everything fresh, it would be great if there was less grease.   The hot tea options are great. The memosa's i was told were good (they ordered 2).   I went for breakfast food but next time i will try the lunch food."}
{"text":"This place was a good breakfast cafe, my wife and I came here for the first time. We liked the atmosphere. We both ordered the b.l.t and it was delicious. Location of the Cafe is nice and calm . We didn't have to wait to be seated . We are definitely going back agian but with our daughter's this time"}
{"text":"The food, drinks and atmosphere were GREAT here!!! Highly recommend!! :) I had the breakfast burger, it is topped with an egg and they made it perfectly! And a Sangria Mimosa to top it off!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning and if you live in the West Valley you will search for a breakfast & brunch spot, you will immediately frown with disappointment. Your options are slim. There is Waffle House, Village Inn and who could forget Mimi's! Yum!  As much as I would love to dive into a cafeteria food my wife and I will always make the long commute to downtown seeking that good coffee, fresh ingredients and finally the occasional mimosa or bloody.  And so I managed to spot Park Cafe on Yelp.  Despite the positive reviews I was weary of the Yelpers because few actually had credibility based on their whopping 4 reviews!   I decided to try the standard black coffee, after all the cup of joe knows and it was actually not bad.  The details like your water with lemon seemed to be filtered, check!  On a roll so far and I glance at the menus and spot the omelette which seems to be there shtick here I asked for a special and to my surprise I was informed of the Eggs Benedict! I also ordered a Bloody Mary and this too was ok.  Feeling excited I overhear that this place is owned by the same cat who owns the ever so disappointing mistake of a Mexican spot, Old Pueblo Cafe. Being optimistic I decided to stay (yeah pueblo can do that)  Ok well the food comes and my Eggs Benedict look like the hollandaise was mixed with ketchup!  Little did I realize they mistakenly ordered me the Cajun Benedict. So being a food trooper I decided to give it a shot.  The poached eggs were well cooked, they were over what seemed to be a descent brioche bread. The Cajun sauce was just okay, definitely a bit acidic and lacked the Cajun taste.  It was served with a colorful array of potatoes and this gave the plate some presentation.   Overall have I found the spot on the West Valley? Unfortunately I will still be in search of it. This place is ok and actually an improvement from what seems to be a business owners investment, not passion.  There is a difference, believe me you can taste it. The manager seemed to care about my thoughts on the food and I had to provide it. Hope they can make this place work."}
{"text":"Came to Park Cafe with my hubby and mom-in-law for breakfast during our Arizona visit and had an awesome experience!  Food was so delicious!!! The place was cute and cozy.  Servers were nice and friendly.  Oh, and they make you drink your mochas in these gigantic cups.  You'll feel like you're never running out of mocha.  Haha.  We'll definitely come back when we visit AZ again."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful spot for breakfast. They have delicious omelettes.They do serve drinks like Bloody Marys and Mimosas and beer. My only recommendation is avoid going there Sunday after church around 1030 11. This is the busiest time for them so if you want to avoid waiting long try not to go at that time. They have an outside patio which is perfect during the fall winter spring."}
{"text":"We visited the park cafe this morning while on staycation at the wigwam. We were a little hesitant after reading the reviews, but we were very pleased. The service was awesome, very nice people. We got there right at 8am as they were opening. We were the only family in there for about 15 minutes. The food was awesome. I had the Hawaiian French toast, hubby and dad got the Santa fe omelett, and our girls got the Mickey mouse pancakes. All of us agreed we enjoyed the food. We didn't wait long at all for our order to be prepared. Mom and dad had the coffee and they both really enjoyed that as well. Rest of us had the oj, which you could tell was real fresh squeezed. Most likely going back for dinner."}
{"text":"First time here! I ordered the shrimp omelet and had a mimosa and a coffee! To my pleasant surprise the shrimp omelet had just the right amount of spice in the green sauce! ( many places the sauce is way too mild for my liking.) Park Cafe did it just right! Also the mimosa was wonderful and fresh. Good coffee too and our waitress was great. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for breakfast. Wife got coffee and I tried an espresso, yuk. Coffee was very good, smooth and fresh, my espresso tasted more like stale boiled down coffee. I got the bacon, eggs and potatoes with a side of toast. Bacon and eggs were good but the potatoes were soggy, looks like they were pre-cooked then reheated in the microwave. Shame because it was a great mixture of different types of spuds. Wife got a cheese, pepper and bacon omelette, too bad that she ordered a cheese, ham, and pepper omelette. It tasted very good as it was. Our waiter was indifferent the entire time we were there, when taking our order he kept looking around at other tables. After I got done with my sub-par espresso I ordered regular coffee, it took him forever to get it. He never did ask about the food, and of course when we left cash for the check we got the \"do you want change\" question. They get 3 stars because most of the food was good and the other employees seemed to enjoy working there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and like it a lot!  The food is not heavy, but is atill satisfying.  The atmosphere is very chill. I usually order the oatmeal pancakes breakfast and a caramel macchiato.  Usually spend less than $20 for my son and I.  This is a great place for an outdoor coffee meet up, when the weather permits."}
{"text":"Adorable spot, right across from Wigwam resort. We had a simple breakfast that took FOREVER for them to make . ((45 mins for eggs and pancakes))However they are friendly and they were pretty busy ."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick late lunch. Walked in here by accident. Divine providence guided us in. Ordered chilaquilles and veggie omelet. Wife kept raving about her multi-colored potatoes. It was slightly crispy outside and soft inside with great flavor. Her rye toast was perfect. My chilaquilles had just right flavor, not too spicy but not gutless. Chips were still crispy despite having sauce over it. Ingredients were fresh. Service was excellent. I don't really have to write this review as an out-of-towner. Need more places like this."}
{"text":"Had a chance to try the new Park Cafe in Litchfield Park Sunday and I'm glad I did! I'm a big fan of locally-owned places and Park Cafe did not disappoint. Cute little place with a great patio, Friendly greeting and outstanding service. I had a spinach omelet that was cooked perfectly and you could certainly tell the ingredients were really fresh. I also tried the stuffed French Toast my son ordered...delicious! The menu had a nice variety and I'll definitely come back to try it for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict. I am an eggs Benny snob. I always love to try a new place in search of the best Benny.  We it's not here although there were things I did like that were a little different. The bread was  chibada like. The hollandaise was descent with descent flavor just not enough. The ham was thin ham slices which is a no go.  I didn't order a sandwich.  The eggs were cooked perfect which is always nice. So all in all it was just average.  Don't go drive out of your way for this like we did."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and had a strange vibe from the staff and the customers. Maybe I was having mental problems. I'm not sure.  In any case, I had some sort of eggs benedict that was quite tasty, and my partner enjoyed some sort of tortilla-based brunch item that basically looked like a delicious pile of nachos with spicy brown sauce. I was happy that they had mochas available, though it tended toward the end of coffee-flavored hot chocolate (a frequent woe of mine)."}
{"text":"Wanted a Bloody Mary. Found this place. Nice little cafe. Menu looked great. But a buddy and I just wanted a bloody mary. Waitress was very nice until we said we just wanted a few bloody mary's. After that she was a ghost.  Drinks were not to order and we had to flag her down for a 2nd round. Well she missed out on a big tip. I believe in tipping well when wait staff is good. Hope she learns her lesson. Good luck here."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. The food is AWESOME and the manager Gilbert is so hospitable and really cares about his customers. He creates gourmet specials at an affordable price and we wish they were on the everyday menu. The main menu is great but needs to expand to include these tasty specials and we hope that happens soon! The food is very fresh and can be custom ordered. Its only breakfast and lunch but hoping they open for dinner at some point with a bigger menu. Great food, espresso bar and even beer and wine too!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food! The Park Cafe is a hidden gem. The strawberry lemonade is fresh and delicious. My breakfast burrito with chicken sausage was so very good.  I highly recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"Awesome food, highly recommended anything from the breakfast menu. Service can be slow, especially when they're busy so just be ready for a wait but enjoy the surroundings and it's not so bad."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem everything taste good and staff is really nice and courteous."}
{"text":"My husband and I split the chilaquiles which was really good and it was a pretty big portion. My brother let me try his burger and fries and they were really good too. This place was great! I love the location,  it's very clean,  not too loud,  the service was wonderful and the food was great.  I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. We vacationed at the Wigwam and found this little gem next to the resort. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito and the kids loved the waffles."}
{"text":"As a new resident from LA, this is a cafe that features a hip, understated atmosphere with great service , food and drink! One of my new cafes choices in the AZ!!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Wigwam across the street where the breakfast was not good, so I heard over here after reading the reviews online. They were not lying. It was Saturday at 10am. I sat outside, enjoyed the mist and absolutely everything else about Park Cafe.   I'm super picky about my eggs (because I cook them well myself). I ordered the vegetarian omelette, substituting cheddar for provolone.   It came really fast and was -- literally -- perfect. All the veg were fresh and had been perfectly sautéed before being included in the omelette. Multigrain toast was basic (and basically perfect). Potatoes were roasted (I think) and included a combo of regular, blue and sweet potatoes. Hit sauce seemed homemade and was great.   Service was lovely and attentive. Price was reasonable. A real find!"}
{"text":"Went to the Park Cafe for breakfast and LOVED it. The atmosphere was very welcoming and the food was great! The variety of choices was refreshing compared to your regular Cracker Barrel down the street. The wait was a little long but well worth it! My 2 year old son LOVED the potatoes. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So let me start this review by saying thank you to Cracker Barrel for being too busy. We couldn't get a table so we pulled out Yelp. From the moment we arrived I liked this place it was a little warm so the hostess brought my wife and daughter some ice water. When we sat down I decided to go with the breakfast burrito. Our waitress Adriana said that was a great choice she couldn't have been more right.The egg and Chorizo was amazing but the chipotle mayo took it to a whole Nother level. My wife had the Hawaiian French toast it was great. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly service and exceptional food. The Smoky Chipotle Panini is amazing. Highly recommend. Everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed their plates. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed breakfast at the Park Cafe multiple times. I have alternated between the Chicken & Steak Southwest Omlette. The potatoes are great that go with it. I love the soup bowl size of their delicious coffee. When the weather is nice out eating outside is very pleasant. The staff is always very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Staff isn't very friendly and the food is going downhill. Every time we decide to give the place another chance they disappoint. The first time the potatoes weren't their signature rainbow potatoes and were mushy. The next time they rainbow potatoes were mushy and my burrito barely had any egg in it. Plus they took forever to bring our food. The drinks are disgusting they all taste watered down so I only ever order water. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food,nice atmospheric and great service. We stopped by for breakfast on a hot Sunday in June & ended up sitting outside in the shade since it was so busy. Definitely worth it. The Southwestern omelette was amazing with carne asada and two kinds of sauce. The chilaquiles are fantastic and could be the best in town. Recommend getting them with eggs & chorizo. We'd definitely come back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up.   Convenient breakfast spot in Litchfield Park, a quick drive away for those living on Luke AFB and surrounding areas. Was visiting my brother for the weekend and we ended up at Park Cafe twice. Service was great the first time, and extremely average the second.   I was able to try... 1. South of the Border Omelettte 2. Traditional Breakfast #2 [two eggs, choice of sausage or bacon, and pancakes] 3. Chorizo Benedict + Hollandaise [my brother ordered this and i got a few big bites]  The South of the Border Omelette was very tasty but a little too wet. It was topped with various salsas which weighed down on the omelette. My omelette was filled with steak and topped with pico de gallo and sour cream, as well. The presentation of my dish was also way less attractive than my brother's omelette presentation. All omelettes come with your choice of toast [or bagel]  + your choice of potatoes or fruit. I got the fruit - a few pieces of cantaloupe and honeydew melon. The potatoes, which my brother ordered with his omelette, were very yummy but were soggy.   The Traditional Breakfast was very basic. It's as simple as it gets! The sausage was OK, had a great bite to it, but I only ate a piece of it before passing it over to my friend. The eggs were plain scrambled, needed some seasoning but I took care of that with the table salt and pepper. The pancakes were fluffy and soft and came with typical pancake syrup.   The Chorizo Benedict was REALLY REALLY good. I actually wanted to order it during our first visit, but our waitress told us that it's only available during the weekends. This is probably something that should be written clearly on the menu so that customers don't get let down from their excitement. However, since we made a second visit on Sunday morning, we were able to give it a try. The chorizo was cooked perfectly and had a great crunch to it. The muffin beneath it wasn't too thick and was easy to slice through and eat. Egg was poached OK but wasn't as runny as I like it. The hollandaise was spot on. Interesting flavor, something different than the normal hollandaise sauce. To be quite honest, I really don't see the reason why it's only available on the weekends, though...  Wait time for food was longer on a slow Friday morning than on a busy Sunday morning. Not exactly sure why.  Oh, one more thing, the mimosas are great! Give 'em a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this little cafe! The food is delicious and healthy. The service is warm and friendly and nothing is forgotten.  Waters always filled,  coffee warmed everything you need is on table. The owner cooks with all fresh ingredients.  I can't say enough about how charming this little family business is. Make sure you show up you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Of the few places we dined at in the Litchfield Park, Park Cafe was the only excellent restaurant. The huevos rancheros was perfectly balanced, as was the tortilla soup. We wished only that we had discovered this gem sooner!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The menu is full of delicious sounding choices. I got the caprese panini with grilled chicken and it was DELICIOUS. The food is so fresh! The balsamic vinaigrette dressing tasted homemade and the signature chips were on POINT. It is only open for breakfast and lunch so make sure you visit soon!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located right outside of the Wigwam resort which it is walking distance. Hubby had egg white omelette with ham and spinach which he enjoyed. My son had Hawaiian French toast with fresh fruit which he loved. I had the the oatmeal wheat pancakes and they were amazing. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem after many restaurants off of the 10 were packed full due to the Cardinals game and it was worth the few extra minute drive.   Kids menu included Mickey Mouse Pancakes which were delicious. It is served caked in powdered sugar so parents beware!   I ordered the breakfast burrito that was on special that day which consists of eggs, cheese, meat of your choice (I tried the maple chicken sausage which I would recommend)  and the house potatoes. It is served with Pico and a Chipotle salsa, which I was warned to be very spicy. Compared to Sriracha, this salsa is closer to a very well flavored mild. The serving was ideal for breakfast, you'll be snacking if you want to make it to dinner before having another meal.   Our server was courteous. One thing our server missed was a set of silverware for myself. They also stopped by as we were the end of our meal to see how it was, which thankfully was going well. There were only 4 tables going with 2 servers present. All parties were 4 or less.   With the flavorful foods, I'd still come back and recommend to anyone looking for a delicious, reasonably priced meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food...went here everyday when I was staying at the wigwam resort. Everyday they blew it out of the park. Sad that I live all the way across the country and can't eat this food all the time. When I'm back in the area I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me say this... The food was AMAZING!! The staff is extremely friendly! 3 of us went to eat breakfast and we all ordered something different. Every meal was so delicious! I went to culinary school (Le cordon Bleu, Scottsdale) and I know good food when I eat it. They make authentic Mexican food with a classic twist! They also make other cuisines BUT! The point is everything is amazing! We'll definitely be back for another meal! See the waitress Adriana! She's so amazing!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My favorite breakfast place on this side of town. Pancakes are so amazing. Great Bloody Mary's. Good coffee. The word is out so expect it to be busy from time to time. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. The pictures of the food describe everything, it's very Cali-mexican food, and it was as good as it looks. I had the chilaquiles plate, I didn't know exactly what it was but it looked really good. It was almost a brunch-nacho. Kind of breakfast-y, especially with an egg on top, but it was GOOD! Park Cafe is different from almost anything else in the area, and that's what we were looking for. The atmosphere was also different... I haven't decided if I like it or not. It was a great change of pace for food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! The food is unique, fresh and yum. The staff was prompt and welcoming. If you like high quality sandwiches, soups, etc with a modern flair, you will love this spot."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place after I found it rummaging through various breakfast spots. It was everything we had hoped and more! The decor and atmosphere were instantly inviting and the service was impeccable from start to finish. They were very attentive and made our large party of 8 feel cared.   The food was great, we ordered the southwest omelette, steak panini, breakfast panini and burritos with chorizo and one with bacon, plus the huevos rancheros and a kids plate. All of our coffee drinks were amazing!   They even let us see what brand of coffee they use and the fresh fruit on the side of our dishes was fabulous as well. Overall a great stop with a wonderful staff and the food was leaving us looking forward to next spring break season!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, fresh and healthy.  The vibe is fun!  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  A fabulous establishment in the West Valley with a SoCal atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you like small, overpriced, and bland menu this is for you.   The building is nice, but small and had only 1 bathroom for all guests.   The food choice is very limited unless you LOVE omelets. Otherwise you're out of luck. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"From greeting to food, this place is a must try. Located in the heart of Litchfield Park adjacent to the Wigwam Resort this cafe offers good food and a warm view. I enjoy the Huevos Rancheros and the pancakes are yum! Coffee was good and they serve alcohol so you can have a mimosa or Bloody Mary as well. Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Great cafe in old Litchfield Park but just make sure you leave plenty of time, as service can be on the slower side.  It's worth it for a great meal though!"}
{"text":"Nice place but way overpriced.  I don't expect it for free, but come on $9 for a breakfast burrito that's the size of a burrito at Taco Bell and and a few slivers of fruit.  Customer service is ok.  Had to ask for silverware.  Mimosa was great!"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp. Thought we'd check it out before the race today.  We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess.  Short wait she said.  It's a beautiful Saturday morning so it was to be expected.  The place is rustic, not fancy.  Cute patio. We sat inside to shorten the wait.  We should have held out for a spot on the patio.  Our waitress was prompt in getting us water and coffee. The menu has great variety. Lots of wholesome choices. I finally ended up with the Oatmeal Whole Wheat Pancakes.   Delicious.  The kitchen was busy so it took awhile to get food. That is where this review would  have ended but a very nice manager offered up some delicious over easy eggs that were perfectly cooked.  Nice guesture. Thank you Park Cafe for the lovely breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been here a handful of times for breakfast/lunch. We have always had great service & the food has always been delicious! Love that their patio is dog friendly. :)"}
{"text":"The best breakfast joint in the Goodyear area. Delicious food and lattes. The servers are all very sweet!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with my family for breakfast and it's ok. Not good enough to make me want to return or my family. Cute little place but the chairs are awful and very uncomfortable. Tables are small too. The service is so slow. We waited 43 minutes for our food. I know this because I checked in on Facebook after we placed our order and after it had been awhile I checked at how long it had been since I posted and it was 37 minutes at that time. Then when our food arrived I checked again. 43 minutes! We were about to leave. Food was good but not worth the uncomfortableness of the chairs and slow service."}
{"text":"Oh my stars!! Super delish food here. This morning, the hubby and I decided we would go out for breakfast, and since we both have restarted the Paleo diet, we had to make a quick getaway from our first choice: a bakery with some sinful looking pastries and no protein-only dishes. We thought we would have a sad 2nd choice for breakfast with some boring eggs and bacon. So not true! We had been to Park Cafe for lunch once and had some amazing burgers and that was where we hosted our gender reveal party last September, so we thought we'd give them a try for breakfast. Oh boy are we glad we did! We both ordered the South of the Border omelet, omitting the sour cream and cheese topper. It was an explosion of flavor! The seasoned steak and grilled veggies were complimented by both the red and tomatillo sauces. It was amazeballs!! Seriously, my new fave omelet. (A side note: we can't be 100% sure we had no gluten or dairy, since we did not ask what was in the sauces nor how they prepared their omelet batter, but we don't have allergies - we are merely trying to shed some post baby weight.) Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. She even accommodated my request for honey to sweeten my coffee. The manager, Gilbert, really makes his guests feel welcome and he was amazing to work with for our private party. We highly recommend Park Cafe for lunch or breakfast and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Adorable place to hang out , my friend and I went and had hazelnut lattes they were perfect ! The weather in Az around this time ( January ) was great !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best omelet I've ever had. Great price great service, great place! I'll be back every day of our trip."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. Breakfast is awesome!  Potatoes were seasoned perfectly.  Southwest burrito is very tasty! Great Bloody Mary's too! Haven't had a bad meal here yet! You should try this place! Lunch dishes are also great tasting!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Park Café for Sunday Brunch, and was charmed by this little spot located near the Wigwam resort. Parking is available for free along the street.The wait time was long, but I was very excited to try this place out.   I had the Sonoran Omelet with steak and I was not impressed. I really wanted to fall in love with the dish. Our server mentioned it was the most popular entrée ordered. What I did love, was the breakfast potatoes that came with the dish. They were so scrumptious and colorful to look at. I ordered a margarita to accompany my dish, which was perfect blend of lime, tequila, and sweetness. My friend got the breakfast burrito and could not stop raving on how delicious and filling it was. Maybe I simply ordered the wrong entrée.  Overall, I might come back and try something else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite resturant for breakfast in the Phoenix area. My wife and I love the Greek Omelette and the Southwest Omelette. Today I enjoyed the oatmeal and fruit which was served in a generous portion. The ambiance of the place is outstanding, and they have wifi in case you need to get work done while dining. The manager Gilbert is always running around meeting and greeting his patrons. You can tell he and his staff take pride in the food they serve! Support local business while enjoying a non-chain experience!"}
{"text":"JANE K.  Small restaurant. It's outside patio is nice to have breakfast or lunch.  Breakfasts are good.  Omelets are large enough that two people could easily share them."}
{"text":"I am familiar with the Park Cafe, but not for the usual reasons. This past Friday, I ate here for the first time, which was in fact, the second time I had done that. I met up with a friend and they suggested we grab some breakfast. Interestingly, we were patrons of the Mediterranean restaurant which previously occupied this corner of Old Litchfield Road and Wigwam Boulevard.  My dining companion lives in the area and had recently visited Park Cafe. And as I suspected, it was a great recommendation. Immediately, several items jumped off the menu, including the daily special which was an Italian Sausage Frittata. For breakfast, I chose the Goat Cheese and Chorizo Omelette.  My omelette was really good! The cheese was creamy and complemented the spicy chorizo. And the fried potatoes included a unique variety (sweet, regular & purple) that were attractive and tasty. And my companion's breakfast was equally delicious. She ordered the Chilaquiles. This dish had a sauce that reminded me of enchilada sauce, but with way more flavor. I shared her dish and wanted to lick the plate clean.  While we were sad to see the previous establishment close, Park Cafe is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. It's a beautiful area which makes dining on the patio very inviting. And after witnessing the line of folks waiting for a table on a Friday morning, I would wager that Park Cafe will be around for a while."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. However the reason for 2 stars is the service or lack there of. I went there today right when they opened at 8 am. We were the first to order and the first party to arrive, after about 5-10 minutes 4 other tables sat next to us. After about 30 minutes the other tables started getting served their food and than after 45 minutes we received ours. This was the second time I have been here and will not be back, we decided to give them another chance since the food is good, but it's not worth the wait, Black Bear puts out just as good of food for cheaper and faster"}
{"text":"Arrived just to be told to wait while host kept wrapping forks In napkins didn't even get asked if I wanted a table or anything but surely enough someone walks in right after and is seated immediately. Worst customer service don't waist your money"}
{"text":"Sometimes the long wait on the food can be pretty annoying (waited about 50 mins today) but it's always Delish! We typically sit in the patio because it such a beautiful area but as it gets hotter I imagine we'll probably sit inside more often. This place is great for breakfast or brunch if your considering it!"}
{"text":"We have been back three times since this and have had great service each time! We love to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful neighborhood. The food is always amazing and fresh and I love how they serve their coffee in huge mugs. Loveeee this place!   Update: came here after a dodgers practice in February. We ordered our food and about 50 min later, we still didn't have our food. We asked our waitress about how much longer it might be (very kindly and casually) and she brought out the manager. He said we had only ordered our food 15 minutes ago (which was not true) and brought out the ticket to show us the time on it. I'm guessing the waitress forgot to put it in? Then he said \"listen, I'm not going to argue with you (who said we were arguing???), but the ticket doesn't lie. I don't know if you've ever been to a place that has fresh food, but it takes a little longer because we have fresh food.\" Then walked away. He didn't apologize or offer to fix anything. We were not being rude or pushy in any way to elicit that kind of response. Our food came out about five minutes after that, but sadly we won't return. I am sad to have a business treat me like my business does not matter, and like I was lying, so I won't be back. It is a shame because I really did like the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm staying down the street at the Wigwam.  I was looking for a decent place for breakfast and thanks to Yelp I found one.  The food was excellent.  But what was better was the service.  The waitress was sweet and attentive.  The place was warm, friendly and inviting.  I'm going vacation tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time for breakfast today. At first it was a slow start to get our orders in, but after that everything went very smoothly. The food was excellent as was the environment. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A different twist on Breakfast.  Park Cafe is a, niche type restaurant, and at least for us, offers the additional benefit of being locally owned. So if  you're looking for a different twist on breakfast, from a locally owned business, Park Cafe is a great place to go.  I visited  Park Cafe today to have brunch with my nephew.  I have been to Park Cafe several times and have never been disappointed.  At times, there can be a small wait for a table when the restaurant is busy, but that's not uncommon for any busy restaurant.   Park Cafe offers unique entrée's, like the Steak Chilaquiles, which are delicious, and a must try.   At times, there is a wait for your entree to arrive after ordering, however,  that's because the food at Park Cafe is cooked to order and not kept sitting on plates under warming lights, and for that reason alone it's worth the wait. However, you have the added bonus that the food at Park Cafe is really good, and we'll worth the wait.  The wait staff at Park Cafe are , accomdating, friendly, without being intrusive, and will offere helpful suggestions from the menu choices based on your preferences.  If your ever in the area, you should give Park Cafe a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very, very good food but the slow service unfortunately stands out. Took over 30 minutes to get food on a Sunday morning. I understand busy times but a better plan to handle a crowd would be helpful."}
{"text":"The Service is outstanding and their Paninis and fries are delicious! The cost is good for the portions you receive. You will not regret eating there."}
{"text":"Just tried to have breakfast there, had to wait a few to be seated, that was no problem. After being seated, it took 7 minutes to get our water after the hostess noticed we had not been waited on. After someone bringing our water to us, we waited 10 more minutes without service or acknowledgement we were there, we left. Other parties were seated after us we're being waited on and orders taken."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast  with my grandparents who aren't too fond of 'new things' and it went pretty well. A little twist on the basics, colored potatoes alongside the messy omelet, fresh fruit and good coffee. Not busy at all on a Saturday morning but still a bit slow on the service side. Would definitely go again; Interested in the panini selection!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome! despite being listed as \"american\" they actually have really amazing chilaquiles and huevos rancheros. and im from san diego, so i have really high standards of mexican food. also tried a bit of the french toast and it was awesome as well. great place all around!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service is slow but still good. We went on a Sunday mid morning so they were packed. Best breakfast I've had since moving to Phoenix 5 years ago."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was alright nothing amazing but the giant cockroach on the floor by the table made it kinda creepy. The little boy behind us wouldn't even sit in his chair he sat at the next table. Poor little guy. The chairs are not comfortable at all. All in all I will have to say that I don't ever have to worry about eating at this place again. Tried it and now I know."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the oatmeal whole wheat pancakes. Bacon was nothing exceptional. Hubby had the h.rancheros. The sauce was unusual but good. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. The seating is uncomfortable. All in all a good place for Saturday breakfast. Next time I will bring a chair cushion - lol!"}
{"text":"Spinach mushroom omelette not giid - super thin, rubbery, Brown. Other meals were good and great presentation"}
{"text":"I recently went to Park Cafe for lunch and it was delicious! I got the chili hot dog and every part of the meal was fantastic. The atmosphere was very nice and the servers were very attentive. The coffee drinks are so good! I've stopped in a couple more times to grab some coffee. Overall awesome experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab breakfast or brunch! The employees are friendly, the coffee is great, and their pancakes are the best. This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Yummy for the tummy breakfast burger and chicken flat bread. Indoor & Outdoor seating is available. They are a dog friendly patio. We will come back.  In another note - I wish Yelp wasn't pushy on the length of a review. Sometimes less is more."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place across the street from the Wigwam for those out of town guests. Southwest cuisine and a nice selection of omelette. Not a ton of variety but that isn't necessary when you do your smaller selection so good.   Comes with an open espresso bar and alcoholic options (Bloody Mary's/Mimosas). Coffee bar is great but their house coffees come in HUGE mugs great to nurse on instead of rushing through breakfast.   Good portion sizes and all fresh and seemingly organic ingredients. I like hash browns but their rainbow potatoes were tasty as well.   Service is cooperative among the staff which ensures full cups, fast food delivery, and clean tables. Porch seating available with space heaters and cool ambiance. Place is a bit small but that makes it quaint too. Great breakfast option for locals or hotel guests wanting to experience the small town charm of Litchfield Park!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't like  Park Cafe when I went there with my wife in early March.  The service was slow and dysfunctional, the food  was mediocre and the place was not particularly clean.  My wife wrote an honest, but unfavorable review and I was content to leave it at that.  Then \"Peter M.\" who is evidently connected with the Park Cafe, claims the review was \"phoney\" (nice spelling) and says he has some kind of text messages to prove it.  BULL!  That review was genuine.  And instead of apologizing for a negative experience and trying to use the review  to improve, he comes up with that.  What isn't genuine is Peter.  If you go there, go at your own risk.   We would have been FAR BETTER OFF getting a 'grand slam' or 'moons over my-hammy' at the local chain restaurant.  Good luck Peter."}
{"text":"Food was bland, service was slow but ambience is casual.  We stopped in for breakfast, order a few daily specials, and a pancakes and egg plate.  First off I ordered a cappuccino and what came out was coffee and foam.  Breakfast plate came out but food was not to good.  It was just okay, but for the price I'd suggest venturing somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great, prices fair. The service left a little to be desired, waited a long time for coffee refills and hot chocolate to be made. The place has potential, just not sure if we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We've been to the Park Cafe several times as we live right here in Old Litchfield.  We've done dinner a couple of times and breakfast a few times.  Recently we even brought our son's soccer team in for milkshakes after our last game.    The service is always really good!  The staff is friendly and very helpful.  It can take a bit to get your food if they are really busy but it's not that big a deal to us!  The breakfast is super yummy!  I love the omelets!!  My son loves the pancakes and the french toast and he has a really hard time choosing between the two!    We love that there is a nice casual restaurant within walking distance to our house!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  The chilaquiles are amazing...best I've ever had, including better than home made!  I add chorizo to mine and I'm obsessed!  Only complaint after going her 3 times is slow service sometimes.  It seems like all the waiters just wait on all the tables, like they don't have tables assigned to them or something.  Whenever I go there we always have like 3-4 different people come help us at our table.  Also there isn't too much inside seating.  But they have misters outside!  Great prices also and good portions.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try The Park Cafe after reading the previous reviews.  We are always looking for something ne to try.   We were immediately greeted by the hostess and seated immediately.   Our hostess came immediately to take our drink orders and answer any questions we had on the menu .  I ordered the Chorizo and Goat Cheese Omelette  which came with roasted potatoes.   These were a mixture of sweet potatoes,  red potatoes,  and white potatoes.   All were seasoned perfectly. My husband had the Traditional Breakfast with the blueberry and pecans added. Everything was delicious.   The service was great.  Several people stopped by our table to see if everything was okay, which we really appreciated.  The owner stopped by our table and chatted for a few minutes.  Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I wanted to go out West for breakfast with a friend. I punched in Litchfield Park and breakfast. This place looked like the best option. Being an early person I got there well before they opened. We chose to sit on the patio and found a table where neither one of us had the sun in our eyes. We got our coffee right away and ordered breakfast which took about 20 minutes or so. Service was spot on the whole time. We both ordered the spinach omelet. The food was really good with exception of some of the bacon pieces had the consistency of cartilage which made it hard to chew. I liked the mixture of flavors which were not run of the mill. By the time we left there was a line for patio seating which is dog friendly. I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place I don't know how many times going to the Red Door spa.  Finally one day after working out, I decided to stop by for breakfast.  It is a good size locally owned place.  They were quite packed inside and outside.  They just happened to have a table for 3 of us.  NICE!  The service was great and food was YUMMNESS...  I ordered the traditional breakfast #1 (eggs, chicken sausage, hawaiian toast, and potatoes).  Everything was good."}
{"text":"A great quiet place to grab breakfast with a friend. Get there early as they can be a little busy and in the summer, you won't want to sit outside as it's too warm and that is where the majority of the seating is located. I would recommend the chiliquiles with an egg. Pancakes are good too!"}
{"text":"Wow, I sometimes wish I could pick something negative to talk about, so here goes for the Park Cafe: the fork was a little small for my hand.  Seriously, this place was off-the-wall excellent. I have never had better Chorizo or Enchilada sauce, both made in-house. I had the Chorizo and goat cheese omelette....out of this world!  My mother has the traditional breakfast with fruit and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My wife had the chilaquiles and after the first bite she sounded like Meg Ryan in \"When Harry met Sally\".  Bring a good appetite because you'll want to gobble this food up in one sitting. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"awesome and delicious, fruits were scrumpcious, i had breakfast burrito and it was amazing. this is in a country club with golf courses so its in a really nice area. not bad for brunch"}
{"text":"Lemme tell you something. The food  here has been amazing every time we have gone. I have had the chorizo chilaquillas and whoa. I'm of the Latin persuasion and have had them many times. However be aware these are a little spicy. Just enough to clear those sinuses. This dish is amazeballs. My kids usually get the pancake breakfast. My daughter apparently thought I was one of her baby dolls and force fed me a piece of pancake. At first I was mad because while she's only 3 and she's very bossy and and I didn't want to get punked like a toddler. Then I was okay with it because  they are actually really good . Don't get excited though because the Mickey Mouse pancakes are only on the kids menu . I have also tried their ceviche. Which was also like another party in my mouth. I basically always stick to the same things if I like them. I'm sure there are other amazing items on their menu. Overall the experience has always been pretty good. It's a small place though so expect a wait if you go during  traditional busy times."}
{"text":"Friendly server, great breakfast burrito, hot coffee. Should have ordered the huevos ranchero instead of chiliquillas,  sauce was over kill & too many tortilla chips."}
{"text":"This little cafe turned into quite the surprise for my husband and I. The food is fresh and delicious. And offers alternatives for dietary restrictions. They also serve lattes and other teas. A refreshing start to ones day."}
{"text":"If you want to be seated plan on waiting a long time.   There were empty tables but the hostess was lousy and didn't know how to keep the tables full (unless you were a friend of the owner).  Food was good but not good enough to come back for long wait.   20 min turned into 35 min wait.  We have tried to eat here 2 other times and left after waiting so long.  It's a shame that they can seat people at their other location ( Pueblo cafe)!!  Maybe he needs to train the manager and service team here"}
{"text":"Went here today, close to home, good yelp reviews and locally owned, was hoping for a decent experience. Oh boy was i so wrong. Sat up at the bar, because as a server, id rather not take up a table for the two of us. Our server summer, was so inattentive and i realize its sunday brunch and they were quite busy but wow, so short and absolutely no manners. Coffee is okay, came in a big cup so that made me happy, but thats where it ended. Food takes about 20-25 minutes to come out and lo and behold its cold. I take about 3 bites and im done, hoping our server would come a check but you know her being cut meant she was going to ignore us completely so i never even got the chance to let her know. Anyway, wont ever be back here, so severely disappointed but what can you expect in litchfield i guess?"}
{"text":"OMG. I'm full or I'd order it again. Chilaquiles (add steak, wish they had Soy Chorizo), eggs over medium. Accompanied by an equally amazing cappuccino, mimosa or bloody mary (I've tried them all before). Everything tastes perfect. Fresh ingredients and made in-house. This does not taste like a casual restaurant. If there is a wait, you wait. Also there's an awesome ice cream shop around the corner!"}
{"text":"Went to Park Cafe on our last day in Arizona came in around 12 ish on a Saturday . Not being from the area we pulled out our handy dandy Yelp app and liked the four star rating and menu options so we decided to give it a shot. We called before to assure there was not a wait and the host was incredibly friendly and told us they didn't do call ahead but couldn't accommodate a party of two if we came in the next 15 minutes. The restaurant is on the corner of a cute little down town area next to a few other small little restaurants and bars.. Super cute ambiance considering we sat on the patio. Well where do I begin.. Upon sitting down a guy awkwardly asked us \"how everything was going  over here \"   And confused we awkwardly told him our drink order. ( okay in his defense he probably assumed we had been sitting there and was attempting at checking  up on us) a few minutes later our sever comes out with our drinks and introduces herself super friendly and bubbly good sign right ? We ask for suggestions and she tells us her favorites so we order. As we are siting down we realize the patio is slowly being sat with about 4 new tables around us. After about 20 minutes the waitress comes up to our table to ask how we wanted our eggs prepared on one of the dishes. My friend and I were a bit dumbfounded trying to figure out if she was just getting around to putting our order in. Mind you it was about 30 minutes after we had sat down. Concerned and hungry we assure our food is on its way. She assures  us it is.. We watch as the newly sat tables around us get their food ... And every single one sat after us yet ate before us. One table of three was almost done eating by the time we got our food. This concerned  us & the host could see we had been seated for far longer then those around us. She asked us how we were doing since she noticed we had been there for an almost an hour and still hadn't received our food yet noticed the tables around us almost done eating. . At this time our food comes up and so does the check since we were In a rush by this time. . . Oddly though no manager no concern just here's your food and bill. Other servers had taken notice of our table and we're incredibly  attentive and apologetic about our experience. Two stars for that and one for the food which was pretty good had we not rushed to eat it. I understand mistakes Happen but you must let your manager know not try to just brush it under the rug. Thank you to the manager who was apologetic. We are never ones to complain but too much kept happening. Maybe we'll give them another shot next year big I just don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!! They're thoughtful and truly strive to give the best food and service.  Just one warning. The food is on the \"healthier\" side. Example: their Traditional American breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and bacon or sausage is misleading. The pancakes are made with whole-wheat which is far from traditional and the sausage is Apple chicken. I repeat Apple chicken. Go with the  bacon."}
{"text":"I went in this afternoon for brunch. I had their chilaquiles with chorizo. They were really good. I also had an iced latte that was very strong but good. My son had the breakfast burrito with a side of potatoes. He said it was really good."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check it out after great reviews. Yelp says they open at 7:00 AM; we sat there until 7:10 and they still weren't open. Bummed..."}
{"text":"This is now my favoritist place to come and eat! The flavors in the food are different and great. The atmosphere and setting is small yet roomy. The staff is great and attentive. Marisol was our server and there wasn't a dish she didn't recommend along with the drinks and she did not fail us. Gilbert is also quite the manager very attentive and involved with everything going on. We are always curious to know the ingredients in our eats and as simple as they are they make the dishes very flavorful we will definitely come back and try out more of what the menu has to offer. If your trying to stay away from ur typical Mexican/American dishes this is the place to come! The picture is chilaquiles with chorizo"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Busy on the weekends, but fast service. Good variety to choose from, always come out hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Fresh, local ingredients make delicious food! Attentive, accommodating service. We love it here!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, menu, service, and food! So happy to have such an eclectic and SoCal type place here."}
{"text":"Park Cafe is a great place to grab a burger and beer while watching the game. It's a nice local place in downtown Litchfield Park."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast or brunch complete with mimosas or belinnis! Hawaiian French toast is good, pretty much everything here we've tried so far has been great, can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Great food and really great service (shout out Alissa) make sure you get the potatoes on the side if they don't come with your meal. Clean restroom, great parking rustic look a must try when in the area. Found this place through yelp and was well worth it."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go. They have Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner that are all unique and great tasting. Keep a look out behind counter for the chalkboard full of great drink options and additional treats. (Coffee, Milkshakes, Smoothies and much more.) Park Cafe's service is great starting with Gilbert and other workers. We enjoy our time there and think everyone should try it."}
{"text":"First time eating here with me & the family.  I was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised.  All the appetizers were super fancy and totally worth the money. The food was great and fresh! I only had a few things that kept me from giving a 5 star review. So upon arriving to the Café it took rather long to be greeted, acknowledged or seated. They were a lot of flies too, inside and outside. Many server's looked at us but simply walked by without assisting. When we were finally seated they forgot about us and we had to literally request service but a polite employee apologized and got us a server. Afterwards our food took a rather long time to be made and served.  If it wasn't that the food look and tasted even better I may have been upset.  Over all, I chalked it up to it being slightly busy.  I'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"We liked the brunch here so much that we went back the next day for brunch again.  They have several Latin American themed dishes that were a little spicy and a lot delicious.  The chorizo omelette and juevos rancheros were our favorites.  There is seating outside or in and they can be busy with a short wait for seats."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot to meet with \"the girls\" for brunch!  The mimosas are delicious and the breakfast is yummy!  I have tried the breakfast omelets, scrambles, pancakes, French toast, traditional, and burritos.  They all have been excellent!  I also have tried from their lunch sandwiches, fries, Mac and cheese and more and never have had anything bad!  Everything has been delicious!  The vibe here is relaxed and it is a fun place to gather with friends and family.   The service staff has always been friendly and fun!  Pretty attentive and they keep the mimosas coming!"}
{"text":"Great cute cafe style restaurant. The food is fresh and made on site. Excellent food and prices. We especially enjoy the Mexican style egg dishes, pancakes, and Hawaiian French toast. This cafe is family owned and operated. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Great spot However, took over 30 minutes to have my eggs come out cold. Chorizo eggs Benedict taste good but cold it ruined the flavor."}
{"text":"GREAT little breakfast spot by the Wigwam resort. Modern decor with a little trendy feel to it, not to mention an awesome menu full of great choices. Good amount of outdoor seating make this the perfect place to enjoy a beautiful Arizona winter morning. Also plenty of bike rack space for those of you cruising around Wigwam on your bikes.   We had a breakfast burrito with locally sourced sausage and breakfast sweet potatoes, Southwest omelette with plenty of fresh avocado and a possibly trademark infringed Mickey Mouse pancake. I say possibly trademark infringed because I have no way of validating whether or not they paid Disney for the rights to use the great Mouse's likeness. :-)  Everything we had was very, very good and we can't wait to get back out here again. Will definitely be stopping on our next road trip out to California, if we don't get a craving any sooner!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten there and I never will.  I was sitting outside at the restaurant next door enjoying  the good weather and their kitchen help was listening to their \"boom box\" cranking out loud music at full blast.  It was just plane rude.  They don't need my business and I don't need to have their intrusive music screw up a nice afternoon.   Next time hire vets."}
{"text":"So this place is kinda neighborhood grunge vibe and I like it. It is an old brick building that lends itself to charm. Also a couple of cool stained glass windows   The servers all seem pretty cool and they have beer, wine, and liquor. They can also do full coffee espeesso, cappuccino etc.   The menu is small but has enough variety. Omelets, paninis, burritos, and traditional breakfast. They also gave sandwhiches, and burgers for lunch.   I got a south of the border omelet with potatoes and rye toast. My favorite thing they have is the options for toast 5 options or English muffin.   If I lived here this is the kind of spot I would frequent. It reminds me of Jonathans in Dallas which is one of my fav in my home area.   The only negative is the odd hostess station/waiting upon arrival.  They have a station outside with a sign that says wait to be seeted. No one was there so I went inside and no one appeared to be the hostess so I waved down the bartender and he grabbed her. It was just kind of akward. The whole time I was there the hostess did not stay outside at the stand. I understand it is hot but maybe stand inside next to the door to watch.   I gave them 5 stars based on service alone. I sat at the bar and was asked about 3 times if I needed anything and was continually given refills etc. All servers seem to be working together well and the food is spot on."}
{"text":"Definately my current favorite spot to go eat! I fell in love with their chilaquiles, the sauce is just amazing not spicy at all.  We have been here a few times and every time the service has been great.  Everyone is so attentive and the manager walks around to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves.  It is a small establishment with outdoor seating and trendy decor. My spouse has had their ceviche, pancakes and french toast and enjoyed every dish.  Location is great, food is amazing and staff is friendly.  I am glad we stopped to try this hidden gem. Cant wait to try their tacos al pastor, heard they are great."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it two separate stars one for service, wait time and the other for food. I've been here two times once when it was pretty busy and another when there were only 3 tables full and on both occasions I was very satisfied with the taste,quality,price of the food! They know what they are doing when it comes to cooking so in my book the food is 5 stars, the reason why they are only getting 2 stars is because the dam wait time to get your food is insane!! The first time I went here there were only 4 tables in the cafe including us we waited 43 mins (yes I timed it) to get our food!! The second time it was about the same wait time! That's ridiculous, I get the whole we make from scratch,it's fresh all that stuff but 43mins when there are only 4 tables in the joint isn't understandable."}
{"text":"1st time we've been here & wasn't disappointed.  I had the chiliquiles (waitress recommendation) & my wife had the Breakfast burrito.  Chiliquiles had just the right amount of \"bite\" & I'd definitely order it again."}
{"text":"We visited during the art fest so the place was super busy but the waitress kept checking on us and giving us potatoe chips and keeping our beverages full which was great. The food was awesome, I need to go back when it doesn't take as long to get our food though. Nice patio to chill on!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I walked with my mother-in-law and kids over to the restaurant, since we live near by, while the kids rode their bikes. There is a bike rack right outside the patio where the kids were able to park their bikes, which was very convenient. We decided to sit on the patio which was very clean and well kept. Each table was topped with a container to keep the flies away. An older Hispanic man that sat us was very polite when explaining to my boys what the container was for. The service is slow but I expected that from the reviews. I ordered the pear and chicken salad, the pear was ripe, juicy and fresh! The vinaigrette dressing that came on the salad was perfect! The chicken was season well but a little on the tough side. Both boys order the chicken tenders from kids menu with a side of fresh fruit. The fruit was actually fresh cut fruit, not pre-cut and packaged, which was awesome since my boys love fruit! They received honey dew, watermelon and pineapple. My mother in law ordered the chicken special panini and it looked delicious! I will definitely be back to try more and their mixed drinks! The service is slow but is understandable for the good quality food that the restaurant produces! It was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Good: fresh & tasty salad, properly cooked salmon, tasty garlic bread; Bad: salmon flavor: crust was so salty I felt like I was licking a block of salt w every bite; Ugly: a rather measly portion of salad and veggies for $12, and took over 30\" to order and receive two lunch salads!  Advice: visit when you have lots of time to spare, extra money to spare, and you're not terribly hungry. Hopefully the salt-lick salmon was a fluke b/c I like the healthy meal options."}
{"text":"They truly have the best chilaquiles with chorizo! I can not have enough of them! However, the business can get kind of busy after 0900. Each time we came the service is been friendly. We are so glad to find a local place with great food!"}
{"text":"We love park cafe! Delicious and healthy! Vanilla latte is Great! Haven't had a plate from there I haven't loved."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place-great location, quaint ambience with seating inside and out, good reviews, but this was the slowest service I have ever received.  We got there at 11:30 and was told there would be a 15 minute wait for the four of us....a half hour later we were seated.  We got our drinks in the first 10 minutes, but finished them and were still awaiting our food over an hour later.    We were there from 11:30 am-1:30 pm; a 2 hour dining experience where only about 20 minutes of that was actually dining.    I had an omelette, another in our group of four ordered the vegetarian burger-which is vegan, another ordered the Challah French toast, and the other ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.  All of the food was all good, not exceptional-just good.  There were some inconsistencies with our orders though.  The challah French toast was not made with challah bread; it was just normal bread.  The vegan/vegetarian burger \"The Pretender\" was on an egg bun so that couldn't be eaten.  The omelette was the thinnest omelette, like crepe consistency, similar to a wonton wrapper, but filled with veggies.  The lemonade was very good, but the Bellini was not mixed nor was the glass full.    The place isn't that big nor was it full, so the wait was incredibly ridiculous and upsetting. We wanted to get out and enjoy a meal to celebrate our last day of Spring Break before heading back to school tomorrow, but this was a frustrating experience.  Fortunately the company I was with was good since it was a 2-hour experience.  We were there long enough to see several friends come and go as well so it was nice to see them and we had time to catch up with them as well since our food was still being prepared what felt like 72 hours later.  I would love to go back and try some other menu items, but I'll have to wait until I get a 4 hour lunch break."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Cool part of Old Litchfield.  Whether you come for breakfast or lunch the menu offers you flavors of the SW.  Used to be good food with bad service but they've fixed that and the service was great.  Great spot to meet a friend for lunch."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC HAMBURGERS! recommend you 'build your own' - those are handmade patties!  buttered and toasted buns - why doesn't everyone do them that way? the fries are the best, just don't ask for seasoning - do it yourself!  excellent service - waaaaaay better than clubhouse or tailgaters!"}
{"text":"I googled breakfast after being tired of everything around me and this place came up. It's a cute small quaint place. The menu is small but offers a variety of choices. Today I ordered the special of the day raspberry mango pancakes with bacon and chilaquiles plate it was awesome!  After seeing the plates with breakfast potatoes on then I decided to order those too it's an assortment of different colored potatoes.   Pricing is pretty good and service was good as well :) I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Giant white Chocolate Mochas with cinnamon, huge yummy omelettes, and a local place for brunch with Mimosas. Yes I said local brunch cafe without having to drive all the way downtown . I came with a friend around opening time and it was already al it's full and others waiting to be seated. Great options for outside seating as well as inside. We decided to sit inside and I'm glad we did. Awesome exposed brick and nice big tables. Our server was great and very patient when we couldn't decide what we wanted. She asked if we had questions and made sure we didn't feel rushed, but still made sure to stay close and check on us when we were ready to order. She brought us our coffee and water in the mean time. I settled on a chorizo omelette , fresh fruit and toast. My friend ordered a spinach omelette with potatoes. Both of our items came out so quickly and looked amazing! The portions were huge and so flavorful. The fruit was very fresh, and even the toast was toasted perfectly. We had multiple refills of coffee while we sat and talked. Loved the vibe, loved the food, loved the service, and again it's great to find a great place for brunch in the west valley. Enjoy my photos and I hope they have your mouth watering and wanting to jump in the car and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"Looking for a new breakfast place we decided to try Park Cafe. Sunday at 11 is a hard time to find a place to eat without a wait. We had no problem walking right in to the Cafe. We were one of only 3 occupied tables. The breakfast menu was really small but the offerings were tasty. He had the sloppy southwest omelet and I had the Hawaiian bread French toast and side of bacon. The only real reason I gave this place 3 stars and not 4 is simple. The chairs. If you have any girth to you at all these chairs are simply uncomfortable. Maybe when it's a bit warmer out the patio would offer better seating."}
{"text":"Great stop for a coffee and breakfast after a long bike ride! Got there before 8am. No wait, quick service. Shared a delicious artisan breakfast panni with a side of fruit."}
{"text":"When this place is having a good day, it is excellent. The turkey club calls to me. However, when they are having a not so good day, it can be very meh. What's unfortunate is that you can never tell what kind of day it will be. It can also be a bit pricey, which is off putting when they are having one of those not so great days. I'd still say to give it a try! Seriously, get the turkey club.  *Update-the quality and friendliness of this place is failing. After the last time I was there, I'm in no hurry to return. And I so desperately wanted it to be awesome."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after visiting where we lived as kids in Litchfield Park many years ago. It was 9:30AM and the only place open in the old part of town so we gave it a try.  They were serving breakfast or lunch and the full menu was available along with a champagne breakfast special. Our friends split the chicken special panini and we shared a chicken burger called the Cluckin. We also each shared side salads. They were huge, very fresh and easily shared. Our friends loved their sandwich as did we with our chicken burger. They came with \"special chips\" that were very tasty. The service couldn't have been better either. They were prompt, attentive, and willing to please.   Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"The only thing I enjoyed was the atmosphere. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was okay. I've had better in a whole in the wall bar. Tasted a bit water downed. For brunch I ordered the Hawaiian French toast and was able to chose bananas or strawberry for an extra 1.99. I was told that they didn't have bananas so forced to go with what they had. When I received my plate there was literally 8 chopped up pieces of strawberry for 1.99 the price doesn't seem reasonable. I also ordered the spinach omelet and there was nothing spectacular about it. I won't be coming back it want worth the money..."}
{"text":"Here we go again...another episode of \"Mediocrity in the West Valley. A pretentious, faux urban chic restaurant pandering to the elite Litchfield Park residences by marking up everything on thier menu because they feel that the people will pay for it since they're not the kind that will truck on down to the local Waffle House or another mediocre suburban chain restaurant that litters the West Valley(Seriously...what is with this part of town regarding chain restaurants and big box stores?). Anyway, you can't charge ridiculous prices for breakfast just because you think you're hip and trendy with a brick wall and exposed ceiling; you need to justify charging $9.00 for breakfast that consists of mouse dropping portions of eggs, one piece of dried out toast and in my own words....ghetto fruit; you know the kind, the typical cantaloupe and melon found at your local Dennys. If you want to charge these prices, provide a sense of value to your clients. How about fresh berries? I'm sorry, I usually will give 2nd chances to restaurants to fix their mistakes, but when their biggest mistake is pandering to locals with price gouging; no 2nd chances for me."}
{"text":"Great Sunday breakfast. We enjoyed a rainy morning on the patio and left very happy. I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict with the spicy sauce, very good. Husband enjoyed the pancakes a lot as well and so did my son. My mom ordered the southwest omelet that have me a bit of breakfast envy. It was so yummy.   The service could use a bit more attention but it's not terrible."}
{"text":"Sat for over 10 mins before the server came. We brought our two pups with us so we sat on the patio. I used the restroom and asked for some water for us and the dogs. There weren't very many people inside so I couldn't understand why it took 10 or so mins longer to get the water. The server to ally came and brought our waters as well as our mimosas and bloody Mary. The server makes the beef jerky himself. The drinks were amazing. We ordered the chorizo Benedict and the traditional breakfast. The food came at a reasonable time. And was AMAZING! We will defiantly be back. May be without the dogs and try the inside part of the restaurant. Great place for Sunday breakfast and bloody Mary's on the west side! The -2 stars are for the wait. Food and drinks is a 5."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My family has been staying at the wigwam over the weekend and have had breakfast here 3 days in a row. I have tried something different all 3 days and every dish I've had has been great (chilaquiles, breakfast panini, and chorizo omelette). The food is fresh and they have awesome lattes! Today I got the pumpkin spice latte!!"}
{"text":"Very nice cafe. It's not a large restaurant but there is also outdoor seating which I believe is dog friendly.  We waited only a few minutes for seating; it was busy but not crazy packed. I love supporting smaller businesses especially when they deliver! They have a variety of alcholic breakfast drinks but I ordered a delicious cappuccino and no regrets. My husband had the traditoinal breakfast and I  ordered the chilaquiles and both tasted wonderful. I'd like to come back again!"}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place when we visit!  There isn't a bad item on the menu but the South of the Border omelette is amazing!  And the peach bellini, oh heavens!  Also, the staff is all about teamwork and top notch."}
{"text":"Park Cafe hosted 40 of us tonight .  The price was right, the food wonderful and the staff fab!!  Thank you for making our evening perfect.   The steak, and more were great! Thank you Gilbert and staff!"}
{"text":"I had the chilacuiles with eggs and chorizo and it was delicious.  My bf had mediocre plain pancakes.  The coffee and espresso both tasted like plain hot water!  You would think a cafe breakfast joint with a espresso bar would have decent coffee and espresso beans.  Good Coffee and espresso do help complete the experience at a breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Great, healthy options, nice atmosphere and delicious food! Finding good places in the West Valley is tough, but Park Cafe has unique meals that will satisfy any Foodie."}
{"text":"Their breakfast hamburger is the best so delicious. I strongly recommend it! The bloody marries are not the best, but will do if your really craving it. Food did take a very long time to be served despite the fact it was not very busy. Maybe that was it was being made to perfection. Had a strawberry lemonade as well that was amazing."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Really awesome little spot in old Litchfield! I really enjoyed their rainbow potatoes with the breakfast panini as well as their chilaquiles.  Coffee is pretty average."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, but was completely let down and will never return. We waited for over an hour and still didn't get our food. I asked for the manager twice and the second time it still took 10 minutes for him to come talk to me. The tables around us came and went. Horrific service is an understatement. The manager blamed the server. We had an infant with us who after an hour was frustrated too. Overall it was horrible."}
{"text":"The experience here for Sunday brunch was fine, but the breakfast options are lacking and the food tasted quite boring. I had the spinach omelet, which was not very flavorful. The diced potatoes were okay, but I prefer hash browns personally. The toast didn't come with any jam and there was none on the table. The only thing that saved this brunch was that they have mimosas, and the service was good. They also had many choices for coffee drinks, which is great. For a place that is open for only breakfast and lunch, they really need a more diverse and lengthy breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"Place was ok. Great location. Food was good, but not great. Staff was meh. We went on a Saturday at 11:15 ish and waited a good 30-40 min for our food for a party of 3 which was breakfast items. Don't understand why this has 4 stars. 3 is being generous- trust me."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is not our favorite spot anymore. The food isn't as good as it once was. Most of the time the eggs taste greasy. You'll even get burnt toast sometimes. It's just not a consistent place."}
{"text":"So my family and I were starting to like this little spot. We'd come on Sat mornings looking to eat outside. Not sure if it's because we're Black Americans but each experience here has gotten worse. I was hoping it was a fluke but we won't be back. Slower service, cold food and little attention to details. Busy little spot but I'm guessing they don't want our money."}
{"text":"Hungry for something different and for Breakfast so I opened up Yelp to see whats up.  Located in old Litchfield, Park cafe sits on the corner location in a small strip neighbored by a bar and Blu sushi.  With large patio dining outside and red brick interior; its got a feel for local litchfield park and avondale residents.  Busy and packed to the gills.....I knew this coming in at 930am on a Sunday morning with the family.  The service was exceptional, however, be prepared to wait. Because you will.  They cook to every seperate order and their breakfast selections are small and limited; but this aint no Dennys.  My wife and I both had the santa fe omelet and both my girls had their own mickey mouse pancakes topped with powdered sugar.  im pretty sure they place cinnamon sugar in the pancakes. The omelet was good and the side of variety potatoes was a good touch.  Good, but nothing too crazy that a breakfast afficiando hasnt tasted or tried already.   The 45 minute wait would cause the most patient children to become the most seizure induced melted puddles left on the restaurant floor.  I offered to mop them up, but the friendly staff kindley declined.  A 6 month pregnant wife became a hungry lionness.....of course...whatever they placed in front of us to eat; was scarfed and assumed delicious.  I had to remove the empty jelly packages and seperate anything edible being nawed on.  To save further embarrasement when the breakfast came; I placed my leather shoes back on my feet after removing some trim.....it was kinda helping the appetite.    seriousness....great service, friendly staff who countinuosly apologized for the wait with our table and all others around, mediocre to good food but not great, nice location and non-chain."}
{"text":"Super cute little restaurant that's within walking distance to the Wigwam Resort. They serve breakfast all day and offer food to-go. I was specifically looking to grab a bite and head back to the resort pool. I don't know if they were short handed in the kitchen today but my food took about 45 minutes to come out. Cute place, great food...don't recommend if you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite and head out."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Arizona and my husband and I wanted to have brunch. This is probably one of the best places I've been to with AMAZING customer service. Staff is very attentive and patient. Food is great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Was so happy to find a breakfast and brunch restaurant close to the base, since we always have to drive for about 30 mins to The watch, anyway today Sunday we came in, there was a wait list and we were told it would take 20 mins which we were ok with, there is chairs and a tent in which you can sit and wait, once they called us, which took about 30 mins, (but I understand it's a Sunday) they sat us outside which I was ok with, our waiter came asked for what drink we wanted blah, then she came back and took our order, after she took our order we never saw her again;, we had servers walk back and forth ask other table how they were doing but never even noticed us even tho we were sitting there for almost 40 mins with no food, and obviously looked upset, oh and there was this manager or kitchen manager not sure who kept talking to other tables about his bloody marry and asking how they were doing which I thought well maybe he will ask everyone, but well I was wrong, anyway after waiting for 40 minutes, on chilaquilles which me and my husband order same plate chilaquilles with eggs over easy, this guy comes up to us and drops the plates down, asks they are the same right? We said yeah. And freaking runs away, without asking if we needed anything else or anything, at this point we still DO NOT SEE OUR WAITER, anyway our food was there and we were starving as soon as I grabbed a bite I noticed that they were freaking COLD.... THERE IS NOTHING IN THIE WORLD THAT CAN MAKE ME MORE MAD I MEAN MY FOOD TOOK FOR EVER AND WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS COLD? Soooo THIS ONLY MEANS TBE FREAKING FOOD WAS SITTING THERE ... I opted to not say anything since well there was no one to talk to since the waiters kept ignoring us and the \"manager\" kept just talking and asking the same tables how they were doing; NO SERVICE AT ALL, chilaquiles were alright since they were cold,...   No coming back. And will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food and very attentive staff. I ordered chicken pannini based on staff recommendation, pretty good and prices are fair"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere in the heart of Old Litchfield Park! The staff is super friendly and quick. Your preference of indoor or outdoor dining. Induldge in a handcrafted coffee beverage or cool off with a Bellini or Mimosa."}
{"text":"Food was great ! Thx to all those who posted reviews we chose this for breakfast bloody Mary's were tasty"}
{"text":"Went with my wife and 1 yr old.  Odd that there was no hostess table.  Perhaps they were under staffed today, but it took a while to be greeted and order taken.  Large coffee cups were very nice.  Enjoyed the fresh coffee.  I also liked the decor.    Took forever for food to arrive.  It was very good, but portions were too small.  I don't plan on going back again."}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Sunday morning. Place was packed. We awaited about 25 minutes for a table for two but we're quoted 15 minutes. We finally got in and placed our orders. I ordered the whole wheat pancakes and wife ordered the chilaquiles. Food took long to come out. I believe they were behind. Food was fresh and very good when it came out. The chilaquiles are authentic. The whole wheat pancakes are filling and delicious. Staff is  friendly but not very attentive, or at least this day. We didn't get refills until we asked.   There's also a bar in house. Building is very old but has awesome vibes. Area is very nice."}
{"text":"Let's start with a disclaimer to set the tone for this review. This is not a negative review.  On the other hand it is not the most glowing review I've written for a restaurant either.  To be fair and consistent then I am forced to give it a middle-of-the-road rating of 3-stars.  To me that's not a bad rating.  I have to start with some assumptions that the owners of this place are either new to the restaurant business or just getting their feet wet at this location and going through growing pains.  It starts from the moment you arrive and see the single tiny paper/cloth sign pasted to the wall over one corner.  It's like they didn't want to spend anything on a real sign in case they went belly up.  That's not a criticism, that's a reality of being in the restaurant business in the Phoenix area in the last half of the twenty-teens.  Inside the place looks awesome. I have to assume (and hope) they took it over like that and didn't blow their entire life savings on decorating the place because it's ... to be blunt ... it reeks of a cookie-cutter chain restaurant like Applebee's or Olive Garden.  Given their location and available space that is quite a shame.  They seriously need professional decorating advice and a TON of personalization to give it a unique one-of-a-kind flair.  The menu is more of the same, and that's not a compliment. Holy cow, there is NOTHING unique on it, nothing that calls me to try it or write an awesome review about it. There is, in fact, nothing that doesn't make me think I'm sitting in any one of dozens and dozens of cookie-cutter chains.  Okay, that's the reality check. How about the reasons we dine out ... food quality, service and value?  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken sandwich on a brioche roll with a side salad.  I found a couple of other Park Café menus online and that sandwich isn't listed on any of them so I can't refer to them to give you a better description.  The side salad (considering this lunch sandwich was $10 including choice of sides) was huge and awesome. Mixed field greens like you get at those fancy places, very fresh, very artfully arranged. Someone at this place understands how to make salads.  The sandwich was also huge and the chicken was quite a bit better than you find in most restaurant chicken sandwiches, lots of gooey cheese and other stuff. I would say I loved the sandwich almost as much as I liked the salad.  Service - everyone was friendly and helpful and there when you needed them with one exception. We ordered Arnold Palmers and never once were asked if we wanted refills. In the Phoenix area with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees it's not if you want a refill, you DO want a refill.  Price - as I mentioned I think they are right on the money for their lunch prices. They've got that down. If they go higher before they settle in and fix some stuff that needs to be fixed they're going to blow it.  I like to note when I see a place being well managed. It was VERY evident the managers were there with their sleeves rolled up and involved in everything (another clue that they're still learning the restaurant business but a GOOD clue ... hopefully they ARE learning from their errors.  If I was going to suggest anything to them that needs immediate fixing is the place absolutely needs identity, personality and character. If they look like just another Applebees there will be a point that people will go there once and have no motivation to ever come back."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre & service was friendly.  - onion rings, excellent.  - pancakes, good.  - panini, ok - eggs came out & whites were beyond running had to be sent back.  - omelette, was so so.  - food presentation was great!  - Tabasco was watered down.  - latte needed more caffeine.  All in all it was ok nothing to rave about, this place would not survive near downtown but trendy places are pretty rare in the west valley. Has comfortable atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Staying at The Wigwam Spa and Resort with the family and slept in late so we needed a place for a late breakfast. They serve breakfast all day so we decided to try them. We were able to walk out the side gate of the resort and just across the street so it was very convenient. Well we were very pleasantly surprised! I had the Chorizo and goat cheese omelette with rainbow potatoes, my husband had the traditional breakfast with apple sausage and the oatmeal/whole wheat pancakes and my son had the oatmeal/whole wheat pancakes. The omelette was delicious, the rainbow potatoes are an organic mix of baby potatoes, sweet potatoes and taro, they were yummy!  The pancakes were SO good. My husband and son are pancake snobs and they raved about them. They liked them so much they ordered them the next morning. It's a clean, pleasant place and we had a very helpful waitress. We don't live here but if we did we'd make a trip here often just for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Next to The Wigwam Resort, is this nice little place.  We were there in a staycation & very much liked it.  Friendly staff, good menu, & delicious coffee.  I had the chilaquiles w/ steak.  It was very good & the chilaquiles sauce was excellent.  My wife had a breakfast burrito, which she loved (it had sweet potatoes in it).  We returned the next day & I had an omelette (not quite a good as the chilaquiles, but still yummy), with a side of breakfast potatoes, yep more sweet potatoes, was good.  My wife had French toast, which she liked.    Reasonably priced & serving sizes are not over the top.  If we lived closer we'd eat here frequently."}
{"text":"We have been longing for a local breakfast place for some time and were really excited when this place opened. It has a great location, and the decor is fun. Unfortunately, that is where the fun stopped. The chairs are hideously uncofomfortable, but they do look good. The tables must have come pre-wobbled since this just opened and the number of sweet and low packets under the table legs easily outnumber the customers. They don't have white bread ( I ordered it, but sourdough showed up), or normal pancakes (only whole wheat..at least that is what my wife got when she ordered the traditional breakfast with pancakes). The beakfast potatoes were tri-colored, Normal (white or russet). Red (Sweet) and Purple (super yuk). Just did not work together. The poached egss showed up in a bowl...with the water. \"That is the way they are cooked\", we were informed. Yes. poached eggs are certainly cooked in water...the water is just usually removed before the eggs are served. All in all, for breakfast, not worth the trip...and that REALLY pains me to say, since the area needs non chain breakfast options.. The lunch reviews seem to be good, so maybe we will give that a shot"}
{"text":"I had the BEST shrimp ceviche here, 2 days in a row!  The chips and salsa are delicious.  My friends had the turkey club to-go and loved it!  Service was great however everyone I have told about this place comments that service is really a hit or miss.  Looking forward to going  back, their menu looks to have a ton of great stuff."}
{"text":"The manager scolded my 70 year old mother!!!!!!! PLEASE BOYCOTT THIS PLACE.  My mom ordered a sandwich and honestly did not understand the salmon was cured, not baked.  The server graciously obliged in providing an alternate dish. THEN THE MANAGER CAME OVER... He started embarrassing her that she did not know the difference.  \"you've never ordered this dish before?\" my mom \"no, I'm sorry I didn't understand\" manager \"you've really never had this sandwich here before?\" my mom: \"no, I thought it was cooked\" manager: \"cured is cooked - you mean to tell me that you don't know the difference?\" I stepped in \"Ok, she's sorry - she's got it\" Manager: \"No, it's my job to tell her what the difference is - so you are meaning to tell me you have never ordered this dish in any other restaurant before?\" my mom \"no - I'm sorry\" he then stares at me and in a very aggressive voice says \"do you have a problem with me!\"  I replied \"yes, she said she was sorry, now stop!\" - manager \"No, it's my job to inform her how we cook food at our restaurant so she will understand next time\"  He then left.  I literally offered to pay for the sandwich since it was such an issue.  I asked to speak to the manager again and he fled to the kitchen never to return.  My mother was embarrassed in front of her family and the others in the restaurant.  FYI - I sent a message to the restaurant to complain and he sent back a scathing reply to me making accusations about my previous interactions at Park Cafe.  I've never been before (and will never return) - so apparently he has issues with other clients also."}
{"text":"Been here a few times have had breakfast and lunch. Food is always good. The burgers are my favorite the burger meat you can taste the freshness haven't had bad food here yet. The wait time can vary. If your in a rush I'd try something else. Only real complaint is the chairs aren't very comfortable."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! The service was outstanding, the atmosphere was relaxing, and the food was very tasty!  I ordered the chorizo eggs benedict with a mocha latte. Perfection."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, but pretty much none of our visit was a good experience. First off we arrived just after 7am but they don't actually open until 7:30. This was not a big deal to me because I understand that times change and may not be updated. We went and did a few things than came back. I liked that we could sit outside especially since it was such a beautiful morning. The server who greeted us was super friendly and told us we could sit anywhere. We took a seat outside and a few minutes later another server came out and have us menus. She told us the specials-eggs Benedict, a shrimp omelette and a breakfast burrito. We decided on the build your own omelette. My hubby got sausage and cheese and I got bacon, jack, tomato and onion.  After we ordered the server who greeted us when we first came in told another customer the specials. A shrimp omelette with a delicious tomatillo sauce, eggs Benedict-normal or Chorizo and a chorizo breakfast burrito. If the specials had been explained to is that way we both probably would have ordered something else. Oh well.  Finally our food comes out. It looked pretty good, but about 1/4 of the way through my omelette I realized that is was almost entirely onion and tomato with a splash of bacon. It was also very bland and the filling tasted like oil. The potatoes were different and actually the best part of the meal.  We never saw our server again until she dropped off our check way after we were finished eating. She did ask us then if we needed anything but at this point I just wanted to go.  The final straw? She comes back and picks up the check then proceeds to go bs with another customer for about 5 minutes before she takes care of our bill.  Maybe if the food had been awesome or if the service had been great up to this point I wouldn't have cared but all of it put together was too much. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I had the Machaca tacos, such great flavor. We were just here on vacation but went 2 mornings in a row. Great chai tea also. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great menu selection clean friendly staff. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted and given a table of our choice.   The waitress explain not only the menu but the special and even the chef came in to describe what today's special contained how it was prepared. The neighborhood offers great scenery to walk off the hardy meal. Enjoy the soft Latin music in the back ground everywhere you look there's interesting art."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch, took a while to get in, but worth it. The food and drinks were fantastic and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my husband and we were both happy with this cafe. I got a veggie omelet and my husband got a breakfast burrito. Both were really good. My husband got the fresh fruit and I got the potatoes. The fruit was the better choice, the potatoes were dry and had no seasonings. I got decaf coffee, I think I was Sanka, my husband said the regular coffee was good but I can't drink it. Overall we really liked this cafe, service was great and it's decor is nice. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is extremely slow. Don't go if you have any plans afterward. We waited with no one checking on us for over 45 minutes, while people all around us were getting food... pretty upsetting."}
{"text":"I never ever ever leave reviews for places that I have been. This place was so awful. We got seated right away. A mother and daughter sat next to us about 10 mins after us sitting down. They got a server right away and order drinks we were still waiting for our server. Server shows up we order drinks got it in a reasonable time. The mother and daughter in the mean time order their food. We are waiting for our server to come back. She shows back up we order food. The mother and daughter get their food, eat, pay and leave all before we get our food. Waited over an hour for our food and finally left money on the table for the drinks and left without getting our food. Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"What a great Lil corner cafe.  We had breakfast and it was awesome! The menu was reasonably priced all around. The servers were very pleasant which is always a nice touch."}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually take photos of my food but this breakfast was a million times more amazing than the photos. I literally live 25 miles from this place and I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to be the man that walked 1000 miles to eat here again. 5"}
{"text":"First time here. Today I came for brunch.  Being seated outside was quick and comfortable. Our server was prompt with our food order but it about 30 minutes before we actually got our food. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the potatoes were great and the apple chicken sausage is delicious.   The two people I am with both had omelettes. The both said they were delicious. One had the veggie omelette and the other had a chorizo, feta, tomato and salsa.  They both looked great.  There was a lot of great looking breakfast and brunch items on the menu so I'll be back to test more out!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here & we love it! Always have had great service & great food. Breakfast is always delicious. My husband had an omelette & I had potatoes & sausage. The potatoes are amazing! Definitely a favorite! Everything is fresh! We will always eat here when we are on the west side of town!"}
{"text":"Neat location. Somewhat hidden. Trendy decor. My breakfast was cold, toast burnt and not sure a tip was in order seeing people around us arriving much later revived their drinks, then food well be us. Waitress checked on us once after a bus boy delivered our cold meal. Had it not been a date I'd have sent BOTH our plates back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Long waits but the food is delicious. Service was friendly. Had a nice breakfast with my daughter. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with giant coffee cups and good meals!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the hype! Our family in town  said this is their favorite spot so we brought the whole family, all 18 of us to see if it lives up to the great places we have in Cali. We Sat out side with refreshing misters and hot wonderful service. Everything 5 stars! The chilaquiles with green and steak was worth the hype. The bloody Mary with the works was perfect and came with delicious Jerkey.   We also ordered the ultimate Mac and cheese because it sounded bomb on the menu. It was ok, we ate it all but did think it deserved the word \"ultimate\". I think it was missing a crusty breadcrumb topping for me."}
{"text":"Park Cafe offers some curious item selections that are actually pretty cool. (Maple Apple Chicken Sausage, Hawiian Bread toast) This place also serves the biggest cups of coffee I have ever seen. The patio sections hosts a beautiful view of the Wigwam and the service is wildly welcoming.  With that said this place is just okay and I will tell you why. The food is actually just okay and the service is slow. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (a personal favorite of mine). The layout of the food was fantastic. The sauce was rather blah. I'm not the type that says the hotter the better. I believe that their is a delicate balance between flavor and spice and in this case it wasnt good. Plus they dont serve them with any tortillas. I found that peculiarly odd. The casual breakfast seemed to be good. However, the service was slow and I mean real slow.  Overall this place is just okay. I would be willing to try something else based on the potential but Im not sure if I would go out of my way to do that."}
{"text":"Very cool little place with great service, nice people and good food. Breakfast burrito with chorizo was tasty"}
{"text":"It is not difficult for breakfast place to make me happy.   The Park didn't fail.   In fact,  they succeeded at making me a fan.   One of the things I like about this location is that it is steps away from the Wigwam resort.  Just exit the Wigwam from the west gates and walk to the corner of Wigwam and Old Litchfield.     The inside of The Park is also very cute with a loft-like feel to it with exposed brick and air ducts.     I've been here a handful of times and I had the same thing, the Veggie Omelet with the cheese and a side of bacon.  Perfectly cooked omelet each time.  Professional service folks who know and understand the meaning of \"service industry\".  Many folks love their French Press coffee.  I thought it was a good cup as well.  If you are at the Wigwam and want to get out but not go far, this is a SOLID option for breakfast or lunch!  YOu will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Service: 100% Food: 100% Ambiance:100% Worth every cent. We had caprese flat bread. Yummy! Chilaquiles and chai tea latte with soy. Amazing.  We met the Chef Gilbert, it was a great person to talk to; you can tell he is in love with his job and enjoys every second of it."}
