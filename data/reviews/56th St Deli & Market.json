{"text":"Great Boars Head deli sandwiches, good beer/wine selection, and all the other necessary convenience items."}
{"text":"Worst bathrooms on earth really dirty gone down hill fast avoid at all cost 1/3 pound burger looked like a happy meal ! My date got food poisoning Pass it by!"}
{"text":"These have been some of my favorite sandwiches since I was a kid. The people are great and still remember me and my family every time I come in the store."}
{"text":"Best. Sandwich. Ever. The sandwiches here are fresh and made right in front of you! The people are very friendly and they will make it a point to remember your name for the next time you come in! I've recommended this place to SOOO many people and every one gives 5 stars! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing boars head meat sandwiches and a great quality beer selection. The family that runs the store are always really kind. I've been coming here since I was a young child and soon my son will be coming here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you want a quick great awesome excellent sub this is the place to go inexpensive packs on a meat. They have a great selection of drinks beers wines come see for yourself I always get the hot turkey pastrami with everything on it he does can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Was working in the area decided to try the deli for lunch. They have a decent selection. I went with the turkey pastrami and was not disappointed. They make a great, homemade style sandwich. And I sat outside for a while and watched this place get slammed right around lunch time so you know they are doing something right. Worth the trip if you are even remotely close and looking for a great deli sandwich."}
{"text":"You would NEVER expect it based on the outside appearance but you guys, they have one of my top 5 favorite sandwiches in the Valley! They use Boar's Head meat and I don't know what it is, but even the most simple turkey sandwich tastes like a DREAM! My husband and I come here at least once a week for sandwiches and to be honest, i've actually been coming since I was a little girl. I used to beg my parents to not make me a lunch at home and swing by 56th Street Deli to snag a sandwich on the way to school instead! They're always consistent, super friendly, and i'm so happy that they're in the neighborhood. When the weather is nice, we love to grab a sandwich and head across the street to Arcadia Park enjoy it at a picnic table with the pup.  ALL of the sandwich combinations are good because lets be honest, you can't go wrong with Boar's Head products! We'll see you soon, 56th Street Deli!"}
{"text":"You would never know it from the sign out front, but this little convenience store on 56th Street and Indian School is quite a gem!  I've been in a few times over the years for a drink or a snack or what have you, but today, I decided to go pick up a sandwich, and I was super impressed!

\"Proudly featuring Boar's Head,\" says the sticker on the saran wrap that sealed my sandwich, and it's featured on the sandwich board as well.  Boar's Head = quality, or so my husband has ingrained in my head.  He grew up on the stuff in Jersey!  

Back to my sandwich... I ordered the turkey with the works on a wheat roll.  ($5.59) It was ready in minutes and totally hit the spot.  My only complaints were that they don't offer avocado and the store has a very limited chip selection.  (note to store - please order some sun chips!)

On a positive note, they have picnic tables outside, although I took my sandwich to go.  I'll be back to this deli / market for sure - I live and work super close by!"}
{"text":"I stopped in quickly for bottled water and walked out with a delicious bacon turkey club piled high with turkey."}
{"text":"This unsuspecting gem offers cheap, delicious sandwiches and boasts Boar's Head quality meats and cheeses.  I was so happy when I stumbled across this place.  It feels like a true \"corner\" deli.  The sandwiches vary between $5-6 a pop with a wide assortment of options.  They certainly don't skimp on the fixings.  My simple turkey and salami on sliced wheat bread was a good 2.5 inches tall.  They also have a great selection of beverages and beers to compliment your sandwich selection.  We sat outside to enjoy our sandwiches and watched a steady stream of happy customers, many of which seemed like regular visitors.  Don't make the mistake of driving by this place again without stopping in for a sandwich."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a bodega on this side of town. The deli keeps it classic with their offerings but their ingredients are top notch. I visit here about once a month to get my sub sandwich fix."}
{"text":"Surprisingly... Amazing!! The fresh bacon makes it mouthwatering. Docked one star because they lacked personality & admittedly don't use Yelp!"}
{"text":"It is a complete mystery to me how this place doesn't have a million amazing reviews.  Don't let the convenience store deter you.  Go inside and order up some of the best tasting and priced sandwiches in the area.  My absolute favorite is the turkey bacon, but you really can't go wrong.  I don't know where they get their bread but it is fresh and delicious.  When we moved this was the last lunch we had, I wish I had a sandwich place like this on the east side!"}
{"text":"OK seriously.  This could be one of Arizona's hidden treasures.  I almost don't want to share this, because it will eventually mean long lines for me.

This is a corner store (appropriately on the corner) of 56th Street and Indian School.  It at some time was probably a 7-11 or Circle K.  But they have THE BEST sandwiches in town.  When you walk in, it's a little sketchy.  So don't say you haven't been warned.  It is a convenience store and in a corner of the store they also happen to make sandwiches.  

If you aren't scared away, then you are in luck, because this corner of the store is where all the magic happens.  You ask the Asian guy at the counter for a slip and you write down your sandwich order.  He then hands it to the Asian guy in the corner who will then make your sandwich.  

They use Boar's Head meats and aren't stingy with it!  I had a roast beef sandwich that had at least 2 inches of meat on it...and with all the toppings, my sandwich was only $6!  

Plus, since it's a grocery store/gas station type place, you can grab some chips, nuts, drinks, beer, wine...whatever you need to go with your sammie.  I passed on the beer/wine since I was headed back to work to eat my sandwich at my desk. I recommend that you too get your sandwich and sides \"to go\"...since it's a corner store, there is no where to \"sit and eat\" unless you like eating in your car...and I have a really weird aversion to people who eat in their cars.  OR...you can dine in the AZ summer heat at a picnic table that is in the parking lot.  But, the table was taken today by a truck full of construction workers who obviously also learned about this wonderful sandwich shop.

Anyway, if you work or live in the area, you need to give this place a try...it is truly one of the best sandwiches I've had in at least a year or two.  I will be going back...REAL SOON."}
{"text":"3 stars for the sandwich, and added star for the beer selection...

AND WHAT A BEER SELECTION! This is not your average liquor store. TONS of great beers in the bottle. Some from far, far away, and some from around the corner. I have not seen this much local beer available at any one liquor store in the valley. Very cool.

The sandwich was good for sure, but I'm not freaking out about it. When I go back here, it will be for the beer, with maybe a sandwich on the side. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with this little big deli! I ordered the turkey and it had so much meat I could only finish half. It was super delicious and it took less than four minutes so that was great too. 
     Huge selection of beer from IPAs to bud light. And large wine selection as well. Good assortment of soft drinks, there's a soda fountain and chips. There's a cute bench or two outside to eat, but I got my sandwich to go. Great little place (its big inside though:) Prices are terrific!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I lived in Arcadia right up the street for a few years and didn't think to try their sandwiches since it was a convenience store. One day a friend that grew up in the area convinced me to try it and I'm glad he did. Possibly the best deli cold cut sandwiches in the valley. They use quality ingredients like boars head and the bread they have is amazing too. They never skimp on the meats, have daily specials and just overall a great local convenience store. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp after driving past it at least 100 times.. Yelp said I had to try the sandwiches and so I did.. I've been back several times since .. 

From the outside it looks like a old school liquor store. .. well it is and they put out some yummy sandwiches .. fresh ingredients, soft rolls, fast service!!

In the corner next to the register is a sandwich & hotdog counter.. fill out the form and pay at the cashier .. if you forget to check the cheese box (they offer five kinds) they yell across the store to make sure you don't want cheese! Love it!

I will definitely be back for a sandwich, poore brothers chips, diet Dr Pepper fountain drink .."}
{"text":"Best deli sandwhiches ! My favorite is the btl,  always go here almost everyday for lunch! Plus you can pick up anything else you need awhile waiting on your food, which doesn't take long at all btw. Nice place just to come in and grab a quick lunch for a good price. Plus the employees are awesome and so polite"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place only has a handful of reviews, but I guess that happens when your regulars are a bunch of Yelp sales people who can't write reviews.

I frequent this establishment bi-weekly and always get a legit sando. Not too many Deli's in Phx that are that classic Deli/Convenient store combo like you find on every few corners in Cali, and this spot nails it. I usually stick with the Ham & Turkey Club because their bacon kills it, nice and crispy, crunch."}
{"text":"Building is sketchy from the outside but sandwhiches are veey good.They use boars head meat and veggies were pretty good. I would come back if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"A great find in the neighborhood. The deluxe(turkey, ham, roast beef) & the turkey-ham on a wheat roll was filling and delicious!  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Cool place, good subs. Staff is always friendly. It's a hidden gem left in Arcadia where everyone isn't a d bag. Plus it has boars head meats so yea those are always good. I've been eating sandwiches from here since middle school and never been let down."}
