{"text":"Nice small restaurant the noodle soup it  is something different from other place !will come back again to try different taste noodle soup !"}
{"text":"The noodle and soup were fine. Price is very fair. Only downside is the atmosphere being really \"cheap\" thus not so welcoming. Staff wasn't friendly looking as well, as there were no smiles on their face. Overall food was satisfying."}
{"text":"Price cheap. HOT soup and noodle. My go to spot when I want something warm and on diet. They have original chicken soup, to tomato soup to pickled cabbage soup. Though I'm sure theres MSG but i don't feel thirsty or having dry mouth every time after eating here. 

When noodle arrive, you need to put the ingredients in the pot of bubbling soup yourself. I suggest:  quail egg, vegetables and meat being last cause the soup is SUPER hot and will make the meat well done if you put that first. 

The bowl itself is hot, I burnt myself once so be careful *

It's surly something to try!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places to get noodles as its really filling and they offer a lot of toppings on the side! The restaurant itself is really small; they have about 10 tables but its never full so you won't have to wait. They have a limited menu and all ranging about $10. The noodle portions are really big and filling."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant, it was recommended by a friend. The tomato broth was sooooo good! I love how the soup is piping hot, great flavors too!"}
{"text":"Another place for \"cross bridge noodle\".
We ordered the original soup base at $8.49 per bowl and the spicy spare rib skewer.
Best bang for your buck. Quality and quantity present. I really recommend the sparerib skewer. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch. As this type of northern chinese noodle joint has been popping out all around uptown toronto. 

The noodle that is served here is in multitple province in china most notably yunan. Its concept simple get a boiling hot soup base and have fresh ingredients in. The most important is the noodle and the soup. 

The soup is good. It is pretty authentic. And the noodles are good texture. The only thing is the portions are very small. And chances are you will need to buy extra portion of noodles to fill your stomach. . 

The cold dish mushroom was a little weird for that region chinese cold dish. As the flavour was not quite right. 

The skewer was not bad. As the flavour and texture of the meat was accurate

The services for this place i would say is one thing that drags it down. As not being very full. The waitress who might be owner. Forget to give my tables utensils. Or water. And gets the bill wrong. Need to constantly call multiple time to get service. 

Overall if your in the area cravimg this type of noodle. Its not a bad placem just make sure your not super hungry. As its portion is small"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite new places to go during a cold winter day! Coming at different times, I think it all depends on chance if A Xiang is busy or not. I've waiting 20 minute for seats before, and there have been times where I didn't have to wait for seats at all.

A Xiang isn't a very expensive ?? location and it seems like a different version of the ???? styled type of noodle. The menu is very easy to comprehend with spicy and non-spicy rice noodles to eat, each bowl costs between $7.98 to $8.89. 

These dishes come in on carts and the soup base comes in a bowl you often see from Korean restaurants. The noodle comes in a separate bowl which you can add in immediately. Other dishes come in through nine small plates that you can also add into the soup base for a delicious meal!

One of my favourites is the tomato soup base! The laksa soup base was a little too spicy for my liking, but for those who enjoy spice, it is a fairly good option to have!"}
{"text":"Like the others have said, the main dish here is noodles. You choose your soup base, and it comes with a bunch of things to put in your noodles (raw quail egg, a few slices of hot pot beef, small dishes of assorted veggies and fungi, etc.). They have a laminated sheet (a tiny one) at the table that explains the sequence in which you put things in (egg, meat, veggies), but it doesn't say when to put in the noodles. LOL. 

Noodles had a good consistency. Side dishes could have been a tad larger, but for that price, this is is a very decent meal. Portion was not bad.

Soups: pickled veggie one is pretty good. really spicy one is good. tomato one is not bad, but more tomato sauce flavored than fresh tomato flavored. Soups were also very hot.

Sides: 

Hot and spicy spare ribs ($2.99) - 2 skewers/order. tasty, but could have been more tender, and definitely not as spicy as I thought it was going to be (in Chinese, they're mala, which usually means super spicy). Warning, there are soft bones in this.

Deep fried stuffed rice ball ($2.99) - 8/order. This is a glutinous rice ball stuffed with sesame paste. Sesame paste is molten lava when eaten hot. Delicious, but strangely not in the right section. I thought these would be savory. I was wrong. Cute though.

Green papaya and kelp salad ($3.99) - That was green papaya? I didn't find any green papaya, but I did find cucumber shreds. This was delicious, and very well worth the price.

Sauteed soybean slice with scallion ($3.99) - beancurd sheet, for those of you who are wondering what soybean slice is. Also a good portion, delicious, and well worth the price.

Nuts and spinach ($4.99) - This one was alright for the price. Tasty, but a tad salty. Nuts were peanuts and surprisingly, cashews. Cashews aren't cheap.

This place is tiny (although we did come with a group of 8 and there were at least 15 other people in the restaurant, so it does fit more than 6 people (See Queenie's review). It isn't fully renovated (Floors don't look finished). The service is predominantly in Mandarin. They don't serve you drinks automatically (none of the tables got drinks unless they had ordered drinks, which I find bizarre), but Chatime is next door! Despite this all, I'm giving them 4 stars because I left with a full stomach and I felt warm and happy, and for those of you who know me, warm is very important to me."}

{"text":"Small restaurant with tight seating but very quick and efficient service.   Good value noodles that come with lots of side dishes and a large bowl of noodles that you cook in your own large bowl of VERY HOT broth.

Be forewarned:  the hot pepper logo is not there for show-it really means it's spicy!   And it comes on you slowly at first and by the time you realize it's spicy....your done!  But it really tastes so good!

I did chicken out the next time I went and chose a non spicy menu item.   

Great choice for something slightly different than your typical noodle place."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????6-8?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Strolling along the strip mall, and found this noodle place.   Had their signature cross bridge noodle and two appetizers; hot & spicy spare ribs and deep fried stuff rice balls.  The noodle came with a hot bowl of chicken soup, a few tiny dishes of veggie, a few slices of meat and sausage, some braised ground pork and a quail egg.  The soup was a bit dull.  The meat and veggie didn't add much flavor to the soup.   The spare ribs were tender and flavorful. The sticky rice balls were chewy and the black sesame filling was nutty.  These bite-size dumplings were yummy.  The appetizers here are good but noodle is mediocre.  Poor service though!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm.The place itself is really small (fits approximately 15-20 people) and they also have another location in Markham, ON. In the Scarborough Midland plaza, it is located across from Sugar Marmalade, beside a ChaTime. The restaurant was busy at this time but we still managed to get a seat.

Their menu was pretty small but cheap in price for the noodles and appetizers. The main thing about this place is their noodles from the Yunnan province in China. Others had mentioned that you can choose your own broth, and add additional meats. Every bowl comes with a variety of veggies(e.g. diced up enoki mushroom, seaweed, green scallions, corn, osmanthus, black fungus), sausage, minced seasoned meat(pork, I think?) and a raw quail egg. The sliced meats come on a bed of raw cabbage. You put all the ingredients in your boiling broth base. I opted for their \"Signature Cross Bridge Rice Noodles\" with additional seafood and beef slices. The broth had very thin (almost like silk!) and scanty pieces of tofu-esque skins boiling from within. The noodles were a nice chewy consistency. The meats and seafood were fairly decent in quality. There were 3 varieties of seafood that were fresh. 

Aside from the food, service was not great at all. Excluding the fact that the servers did not speak or understand a word of English (making ordering additional meats hard because on the menu any and all additional meats was listed in Chinese) and despite the service was very fast, I was very disappointed, and baffled by the demeanor of the servers themselves! 

The servers were very rude and unpleasant. It was everyone at my table's first time here, so when the server placed our plates of assorted ingredients and raw meats (in a stack), we assumed to grab the plates ourselves. We attempted to grab the plates off ourselves when a merely 5 seconds, not only did the server shoot a harsh \"do not touch!\" in Mandarin but also gave a sharp glare at us as she walked away. We were left confused while waiting for our broth. When our soup broth bowls came out, the other server fired an angry \"IT'S HOT, DON'T TOUCH\" in Cantonese this time (LOL!). We were given NO direction of what to put in first making us confused all at the same time. So we wanted to ask the server for their opinion/recommendation as to what to put in first. We tried alerting the servers on several occasions while the broth was boiling hot for their opinion, and they didn't bother to notice us (confused customers...) Some of us put the meat first, others put the veggies in first. All of what it came down to was: Did all those server interactions really just happen?!

Overall, nice/light food + quick eat + bad service"}
{"text":"Mediocre bowl of noodles at a noodle joint means I won't be back here.

The restaurant itself is small with some of these really cheap chairs. I have low expectations for service at quick Chinese restaurants so nothing to note. In terms of the food, I was extremely disappointed. I had the signature noodles and a side of their beef yakitori balls. 

Beef Yakitori 1/5 - I couldn't believe they even served this. It was basically cheap meat balls, fried with ketchup on it. 

Noodles 2.5/5 - comes in a stone pot so it's HOT, a bit too hot for me that I could barely enjoy my noodles until the second half of my bowl. The noodles comes with some beef, veggies sides, sausages, and egg. All basic cheap stuff. I found the soup clear, fresh but basically flavourless. 

Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Cheap, and good 

Came by for lunch today and was highly satisfied with my Tom yum with rice noodle order. the Tom yum soup was made just right. 

only problem is that there was hardly any AC inside the restaurant and there was just by the entrance. was sweating eating this hot bowl of noodles 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"When the food first came, it was presented in a very enticing manner with all toppings served in separate little dishes. Looked cool and I did get a little excited with all the choices but come to think of it, they must really abuse that dishwasher lol. The signature noodle soup was alright. I liked how the soup had a more subtle flavor and isn't overly salty but I find that depends on your preference. 

I must say I really enjoyed the spinach and nut salad!!!  I liked the strong garlic flavour but it's actually bidding on the overly salty side unfortunately. I had to dip it in my signature noodle soup to remove some of the flavor when I was nearing the bottom of the dish because there was a lot of sauce. My boyfriend said he tasted vinegar as part of seasoning but I didn't. I guess it has a kind of unique flavour? Give it a shot! I was skeptical too :)

Would go back for the salad and probably try some of their other soup flavors. Apparently you get the same toppings for all the noodles, it's just the soup base  that is different."}
{"text":"Apparently, this is a newly opened chinese noodle place. The place is pretty small. We were a group of 6. It barely fit all of us. There are only a few items in this restaurant, I was hoping that's their best dishes.


Food comes fairly quick, you are suppose to put in all the side dishes come with the noodle. The side dishes were very small, and the server kept telling us to do this and do that. Such that, she can collect the dishes faster. 

The food was average, noodle not hot enough, portion is small. If you are looking for snacks between meals, or  quick meals. This place is an option."}
{"text":"a! Xiang's menu is really simple, serving a twist of Crossing the Bridge Noodle ???? but with a choice of different soup base. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_bridge_noodles

Soup is served pipping boiling hot and you just put the ingredients which are all cooked or semi cooked in and wait for everything to warm up.

The Famous Hot and Spicy Noodle Soup ($7.98) was quite spicy but delicious. I really enjoyed that but the toppings and noodles portion was pathetically tiny. I opted to order an extra portion of noodle ($1) as not to be hungry.

There are also some cold and hot side dish you can order too.

a! Xiang not a bad option if you have craving for noodle soup especially when the weather is cold. But if you are a big eater like me, then you might have to order extra portion or 2 of noodle."}
{"text":"Still open to last minute customers. Quick service! Yummy noodles. Sides are cheap and not bad. Lots of soup and noodles and the topping are not bad. The meat omg. Actual sliced beef not the hot pot thin kind the nice thicker kind and extra meat was only $1.80 not bad for 6 extra pieces. Noodles were only $8 non refillable but is very filling! Would come a again"}
