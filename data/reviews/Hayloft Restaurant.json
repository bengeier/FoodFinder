{"text":"My husband and I tried it and honestly loved it. Great atmosphere, good music, great staff, topped off with fantastic food. Highly recommended. They use local produce, and local meat. Support local, is always a winner in my book."}
{"text":"We have been many times and each visit brings an amazing experience, delicious meal, attentive service and a warm atmosphere. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 4 for dinner. Service and ambiance was great for a catchup session with friends. The food was delicious. We started with the 2 pounds of mussels. The sauce and bread were delicious. Using the bread to soak up the sauce with mussels and meat was spectacular. Mussels were fresh!  I had the fish and chips and the better was nice and the fish was flakey. The tartar sauce was tasty as well. The coleslaw was so refreshing. Didn't have that heavy mayo taste and was a perfect side to the perfectly fried fish. My hubby ordered the chicken and it was moist and served with saut√©ed farm fresh veggies. Our friends ordered the pasta and the tuna. They both enjoyed their dishes as well. We were more than full but had to try all the desserts. The banana bread was to die for. That was definitely our fave and next would have been the pana cotta. For a restaurant that hasn't been open that long, the service and flow of food went above our expectations. Professional and organized all the way. I'd highly recommend for any occasion!"}
{"text":"We didn't have the best experience food wise here, I had such high hopes for it based on the reviews I had read.  The decor here is so cute and rustic, and the service is awesome.  They rectified our food concerns when we brought them up, which was greatly appreciated.  I think I'll give Hayloft another try, and hopefully I'll get to have the same, positive experience that others have had."}
{"text":"it is very good food but very very expensive. about $275 for a 5 course meal with wine pairings for 2 people."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner one night. He got the brisket and it came out looking like a slab of tenderloin. Definitely not our fav. I got the chicken. It was alright but there wasn't much to the plate... I've heard mix reviews on this place and some have told me that they've switched it up. I'll definitely try once more, just to make sure ;)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favourite restaurant! It's my \"Go To\" special occasion restaurant. The menu changes regularly but it's mostly locally sourced, farm to table fare. The dishes are prepared by people who love the food and want to bring you new and exciting ingredients and flavours. Service has always been very good, without hovering. A relaxed atmosphere encourages you to stay and enjoy your meal, rather than trying to turn over the table."}
{"text":"I just had a great afternoon tea at Hayloft. $40 for two people seemed like an appropriate amount to pay for the food that we got.  To start we tried the Buckingham Palace tea - amazing! We also fell in love with the beautiful teacups and tea pots they use here - definitely adds to the feel of high tea. We also tried a Berry Berry tea that was really nice and light.  For sandwiches we had the cucumber dill (which I can't recommend enough!) and the chicken salad.  When I looked at the menu online I didn't realize that the selection of sweets meant one of each sweet on the menu. The highlight of these was the chocolate scone! I was surprised how full I was after the sandwiches and sweets - this was a great way to spend the afternoon and I'll definitely be back for tea again and to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"It's lovely to have a high end independent restaurant in Airdrie! We had dinner here for our anniversary and loved everything. The food was fantastic, the service excellent."}
{"text":"Nice fine dining at reasonable prices. Had the steak and It was great. Open concept to the kitchen and cooking staff."}
{"text":"It's amazing. The food was phenomenal and the service was great. My wife had the pork belly and I had the fish and chips. So goooood."}
{"text":"Booo...unless you are some sort of food snob that loves odd pairings, limited menu and nothing to get excited about.  I am Italian, and love great food.  Give me New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Montreal, Toronto...those are great food cities!    This is a limited menu...and we tried 6 items...none of it above a \"meh\".  Other than the bread..that was excellent.   We will not go back...and its another one of those Really? moments.  $200 later..and I am home eating peanut butter on home made bread because I am hungry."}
{"text":"Went for the High Tea and I have to say was not overly impressed. For $20 each you get some sweets and one sandwich.  The sandwich you get to choose and because there were 5 of us we each chose one since they had 5 in the selection.  Now while I know this is high tea, those sandwiches much have had some thick crusts because there was no way that was one sandwich each.  The tea selections were good, the scotch egg was good but honestly, we arrived at noon and we left after 2 and the place was pretty empty. Parking also is horrible. Not sure I would bother going again, for any meal if this was an indication."}
{"text":"Brutal! If I spent 50 bucks it wouldn't sting as much but I spent twice that and had water. Had the Rabbit and dry Pasta dish. How do you screw up pasta, it's microwaveable now?! Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in the courtyard of a bunch of condo complexes.  The restaurant had a very nice cozy ambiance.  Everything we tried on the menu was delicious.  The steamed mussels were very fresh.  I had the pasta and it was made from scratch; it was cooked perfectly. My husband really enjoyed his ahi tuna.  Can't wait to go back and try the brunch. It's definitely worth the drive from Calgary and would be on my must eat list for Airdrie!"}
{"text":"We went to Hayloft after reading a very positive review in the Globe and Mail. We had an interesting meal; it definitely had its moments, but it also suffered from some significant flaws that were repeated across multiple dishes.  We ordered the \"Family Style Chef's Surprise Menu\", which was pretty much as described: the chef made whatever struck his fancy and we ate it. :-)  The dishes were:  * Corn chowder topped with bacon * Beet salad with roasted garlic, gravlax, arugula, and sauerkraut * Angel hair pasta with chorizo and squid * Steamed Lingcod in a red wine sauce served on a bed of white beans * Parsnip cake with goat cheese, Asian pear, and meringue    Describing each dish in detail:  The corn chowder wasn't particularly notable other than that it had so many bits in it that it ate more like corn and stuff topped with chowder rather than a corn chowder. It could definitely have used more salt or seasoning. 2.5/5.  The beet salad contained several different kinds of beets, and the chef painstakingly described the origins of each. They were lightly dressed and very tasty. The flavour in combination with the house-made sauerkraut really didn't work for my wife, although I didn't mind it, but we both agreed that the strongly flavoured gravlax didn't pair well with anything else in the salad. Overall the dish was a weird mishmash of discordant flavours, served in very large pieces. If we'd just been served the dressed beets and perhaps the garlic we would have loved the dish, but with the other components it was a mixed bag. Somewhere between 1.5/5 and 4/5 depending on what ingredients you got in that particular bite.  Not too much to say about the angel hair pasta dish other than that it was delicious. 4.5/5.  The cod was also tasty, and both of us were surprised that it had a vaguely Asian flavour profile. 3.5/5.  The cake was overdone and dry. The goat cheese was nice, but totally overpowered the thin slices of Asian pear. The dish was also interspersed with big chunks of meringue, which didn't work at all. Meringue crumbles would have added a hint of crunch to the dish, but since the pieces were so big we ended up eating the other ingredients, then occasionally pausing for an inexplicable mouthful of meringue. The dish would have been better without the meringue, although its real flaw was the overdone cake. 2.5/5.  Overall it was a meal of highs and lows -- the best parts of it were fantastic, but then the next bite often included a jarring flavour that didn't pair well at all with the previous one. Too often there were big chunks of too many ingredients that clashed instead of complimented each other, which made it hard to eat the ingredients together as a unified dish rather than taking alternating bites of each ingredient on the plate.  It was an interesting meal, the wait staff was very friendly, and the chef brought every dish to our table to describe it. We'd go back, but if our experience was typical, the Globe review and the other reviews here were extremely generous."}
{"text":"A unique and pleasant experience in Airdrie. The food is progressive, ever-changing and dynamic. From their Buffalo \"Pemican\" appetizer (a delicious take on a rustic pate) to their surprisingly perfect elevation Fish and Chips. The service matches the food in professionalism, care and attention while still maintaining a home-like feel.  We will definitely be regulars to sample the menu as it changes frequently.  It is nice to stay in Airdrie and still have a truly fabulous experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner last Friday evening.  I had read some great reviews online about this place so wanted to give it a try. I must say when you walk through the door the decor is very welcoming and it's a warm atmosphere. The bar and kitchen border the right hand side of the restaurant with an open concept kitchen.  The tables are all set along the left side of the restaurant with some really long tables for large groups directly across from the kitchen. Our table was tucked in the back just around the corner from the kitchen therefore I did not have the best view, I was looking at two other tables while my husband had a blocked view of the kitchen.  One thing I did notice was the amount of staff they had working for such a small place.  I think I counted 6 on the floor and 4 or 5 in the kitchen!  I later found out one of the gentleman on the floor was indeed the restaurants owner.  It was nice to see him out on the floor and talking to the guests and busing tables.   Our server was ok, she seemed to be a tad bit frazzled though I'm not sure why.  I ordered the white bean dip with flatbread as an appetizer to share.  It was a generous amount which was pleasant with a decent amount of flatbread.  As for flavor, it was lacking a bit of seasoning and maybe some herbs/garlic.  For mains I ordered the Gnocchi as I wanted to try their homemade pasta, as a rule I never order pasta at a restaurant unless I know it's homemade. ( I can cook pasta at home) My husband ordered the Ling Cod and chips.  The Gnocchi was very tasty and they were a nice size and had just the perfect crisp to them.  They came paired with Morel and chanterelle mushrooms, with Kale, pork lardons and a pesto type sauce.  All of the flavors together were fantastic.  I had the full order and I was full.   My husband's Ling Cod was very light and flaky and had a wonderful mouth feel.  It was served with huge homemade taters wedges which where pan fried.  They paired wonderful with the homemade tomato relish (in place of ketchup) and the tartar sauce.  I would most defiantly recommend the Ling Cod and chips if you have a chance to stop in here for dinner.    Unfortunately neither of us had any room left to sample dessert so we may need to go back. Upon our departure we found a magazine article which outlined the owners bio and we learned of the decor features of the restaurant which has a large wooden door from a local home and the bar is made from barn doors.  Very unique."}
{"text":"Six of us ate here tonight we loved the hayloft concept and the tribute to Airdrie's roots and best of all the food was really good!"}
{"text":"We went to Hayloft to celebrate a birthday. I was very impressed with the ambiance and the food was fantastic. The service was really great at accommodating our large group with dietary restrictions. It is worth making the trip from red deer to go and enjoy a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times.  Date night with my husband and for special occasions.  The d√©cor is great, the food is original and tasty.  Best of all, locally sourced.  The owner is friendly.  Its pricey, but worth the money for those special occasions.  I also took my mom for their afternoon tea - that was a great experience.  Airdrie is really lacking in higher end restaurants so I am grateful we now have Hayloft to meet that need."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Service was excellent and food was awesome!  The rhubarb mojito is one of the best cocktails I've had...  Eggs Benny, Fry Up and Bison Pemmican were all very tasty!  I would defiantly recommend :)"}
{"text":"So. Good. Worth every penny. Flavours on point, service was great. Innovative menus. Brunch is good too! Check out this little gem"}
{"text":"My Hubby and I went to check out the Hayloft  for a Valentine's Lunch.  So we tried the  Fish and Chips and it did not disappoint - piping hot and so flavourable !  We got there for a late lunch and therefore had fabulous  service , with a lovely quiet atmosphere ! Perfect for a Valentine's Date  We will definitely be back for a Dinner some evening ."}
