{"text":"Dishonest thugs.  Took over 90 minutes to get a cold pizza.   My first and last time ordering from these amateurs who don't give a rat's about people or just giving a straight story.  I caught them in a total of 5 lies.  Each time I called, they told me outright lies, like \"it's on it's way\", etc; it will be free if it's cold. only to change his mind on the next call and accuse someone next to him of hanging up on me, but it was his voice.   All you get it double talk and no apologies.  Driver shows up.  Pizza is cold, no insulated bag to be seen as I watched him stroll down the street.   I asked him, So, is it cold, said I waited 90 minutes and 30 minutes ago, his boss said it was on it's way.  Driver shrugged and said, \"i just picked it up.\"   I said, \" you telling me they're lying\".   Shrugged.  No apologies.  I called back to tell them what the driver said.  This time the girl said, well we're busy, it's 60 minute delivery time.   I swore like I never swore before.     They are all used to abuse from angry customers.  Why?  THUG-LIFE."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. The service is good too, both delivery and in the restaurant."}
{"text":"They seemed racists. My friends & I came in and We were seated right away. The waiter took our order. 2 other family's come in about 15 mins later. We were still waiting on our food, next thing you know. Both the family's got served first. I believe both families were of Greek race since they were speaking to the employees in another language. We waited an hour for our food.. While the other 2 families were already eating & one of the families was done eating & left already. While we were there first still waiting on the food. I don't understand why we got serverd last when we were first there.. I really do believe it was cause of our nationalities, other than that. The food was delicious. . 1 hour later.."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out of the following appetizers to make a meal for 2 for a total price of $34.50: Dolmadakia (8 pieces and veggies) Keftedes (5 pieces and veggies) Manies Greek Bread (huge order!!!) Food was delish - price was pretty good - and service was great."}
{"text":"The blandest pizza in Calgary, the night I went the pizza sauce seemed like a squirt from a ketchup packet, raw onions the size of dimes gross!  I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use but it should have a flavour? Never would recommend"}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of this family-owned Greek restaurant since they opened. The food is consistently high-quality and tasty. The service is friendly and relaxed. You get excellent value for the price you pay. The restaurant is always clean and welcoming.  This restaurant is exactly what it promises to be -- a wonderful, home-style, family-owned Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times now and every time I'm blown away by how good the pizza is.  Their pizza is more of a deep dish (not quite Chicago deep dish but still) style so it is quite filling.  10 inch met feeds both myself and hubby.    They make it all from scratch so it takes a bit of time to prepare but so worth it.  I usually get pineapple and pepperoni and it never disappoints.  Great tasting cheese, layers of pepperoni and plenty of pineapples.  The place is always very clean.  It has got to be one of the best kept secrets of 17th Ave."}
{"text":"New owners have ruined this place..food is awful...stay away from here...The old owners were true restaraunteurs...these guys are a couple of hacks that used to own a take out pizza joint somewhere out east....."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had.  Especially since it had a black hair baked into the cheese. Pizza was overpriced for what you got. Called to complain about the hair and the girl said she would have someone call me back about it and no one ever did. That's what I call horrible customer service. Best pizza in town is BIG JOHN'S!!!! Yum."}
{"text":"Love the lamb and Nicks drinks are amazing! Stumbled in while walking down Calgary 17th st. Great Greek food overall."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Manie's ever since I moved here about three months ago. I heard the pizza was some of the best in town. Indeed the pizza is very good. We ordered delivery - which was fairly prompt - so I can't speak to the service or the atmosphere inside the restaurant.   We got the veggie pizza, plus feta, and spanakopita for an appetizer. The spanakopita was very good. The dough was flaky, as it should be, and the spinach was fresh and flavorful. The pizza was also very good. The dough's consistency and texture is almost Chicago-like, as is the thickness of the pie. But it's not a sauce-on-top variety like in the Midwest. The crust was chewy in the middle and crunchy on the edges. And the veggies and cheese were piled high. It's a very unique pizza for the area. I loved it, though it was a little on the filling side.  The food was great. I'm definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"I came to Manies for a early dinner this weekend and i don't know if owners changed or what? My friends and I  ordered the following with results: Taramosalata was yummy, Eggplant dip was bland and you can taste the olive oil more then the eggplant, Cretan pizza which was way over cooked the crust was hard and there was not alot of cheese so the top was not gooey but crusty. We had ordered 2 pizzas both were way over cooked. So if u order pizza ask them to take it out of the oven sooner.  The flaming cheese was good but was not formed like other Greek places i have eaten. Overall the service was awesome! The waitress was so tenative and full of smiles and was very pleasant. I just wish the food was more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Mamie's is the only pizza place I order delivery from in Calgary. Found it by fluke using google maps and didn't even know it was a Greek restaurant.   Ordering the \"6 Topping\" pizza lets me get everything I want on it and allows me to double up on things like ham and pepperoni, at quite a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good Greek!  Not expensive, uses top quality ingredients, very good service.  The food is prepared as it should be, and they have some VG Greek wines......I'll be back.........."}
{"text":"Had manies a few times couple years ago and it was really yummy the last time I got the chicken souvlaki pizza and it was pretty bland, not near enough tzatziki which made it really dry but lots of cheese!"}
{"text":"How can this be? There aren't that many Greek restaurants in the city, but this place needs to engage in something else. Not sure why anyone would invest in a restaurant and not make sure to get it right, for even when times are tough faithful customers will return and tell all their friends. It seems another reviewer from back east highly recommends Manie's, but perhaps his visit preceded our visit when it's possible another owner or cook was present... But this place...? I will never go back. Just not flavourful or authentic enough. Bland and boring is not what a good Greek restaurant should be all about.  If you are up for the drive, check out My Greek Plate in Cochrane, as really hard to find an excellent Greek restaurant in the city.  But skip this place!"}
{"text":"UHorrible establishment that is run by a criminal with below average food and am owner who will literally steal from thier best customers.  We had spend over $2,000 with these guys over the past 6 months simply because they delivered late at night but had to gladly stop issue? them after we confronted the owner over him double billing is numerous times.  The food will make you sick once in a while, usually the day after complaining about them once again once again shorting our order, i.e. not receiving stuff we had paid, for or simply pointing out that they have double charged us again.  The owner can't speak for some reason, so he simply yelled at us when we simply asked him when we can get the food or money they has stolen from us multiple times.  Still to to this moment we have still gotten no replace food and only once can of replacement pop a few months ago.    I repeat, do not dare eating at this place."}
{"text":"I had heard there was new owner, but every time I ate here I thought the food and pizza was excellent I just don't live close enough anymore to get any!"}
{"text":"The toppings are cold, while the pizza is hot. Garlic bread is exactly how it sounds a single piece of bread with garlic on it. Would not recommendz"}
{"text":"I had the meatball sandwich with Greek salad. If you like Greek this place is the place to go. Homemade bread tasted like it was just made. And for $10.50 at lunch how can you go wrong? The server was really friendly and quick. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've never been in Manies but I've ordered catering from here and I'm pretty sure that's sufficient to never get me in the door.   I ordered on Just-Eat as they had catering on their menu there.   First of all, I order online because it can take hours on the phone getting catering orders right and I just don't have time for that stuff sometimes.   So imagine my surprise that I ordered online and had 4 phone calls to follow.   Phone call 1 - just -eat to confirm I wanted it at a time in the future.  This call is fine.  Phone call 2 - a belligerent man basically yelling at me from manies.  This man should never talk to customers.  He didn't know what I wanted (I selected options from a preformated menu online...)  what is this 204? he'd ask  I don't know ... I ordered by name sir.   you can't have 3 choices of pasta he tells me and accuses me of assuming everyone got individual portions.  Nope... I selected catering for 20 people as the option and it let me pick 3 pasta dishes and I explain that and also explain that at $240 for that option I'm not assuming individual servings.  He says the trays come in servings for 7.  OK... so 20/7 = 3.  Can I have three trays of different pasta?  Finally yes... he agrees I can have 3 kinds.  Then the salad became an issue.  Then the fact I ordered extra garlic bread when garlic bread was included (I wanted people to have two pieces if they wanted... is that a crime?)... and then there is questions about what I mean by cherry cheese cake.  Um--- I want cherry cheese cake for 20 people like the menu said.  Ahhh ok.   Then a lecture about tipping the driver (just eat has the option of tipping in advance)...  I don't know why I dignified this person (who turned out to be the driver) with a response about why I don't tip in advance (#1 to make sure the driver gets it as I've heard owners will pocket tips and give an average amount and #2 if they are late and rude they won't get nearly as much as if they were helpful, on time and made my life easy.    he demanded I fax a map over there so the driver wouldn't get lost.  The driver didn't come to the place I indicated but atleast he made it.   Phone call 3 - more questions about the order (which was very basic)  Phone call 4 - the morning of the event - what pasta dishes did you want?   1. this was entered online 2. I clarified this to the driver who berated me and 3. you're waiting until under 2 hours until service to ask?  I can't tell you how much time this SIMPLE order took me.  I think I could have cooked the food in that much time.   Food arrived on time.  It was Mr. crabby pants driving.  He said he thew in an extra lasagna for us (maybe for the tip... because they didn't give us more than we ordered...  I guess they were still confused?).  The food was warm which was good.   Over all the food was weak.  The meat sauce was barely identifiable as meat sauce.  The lasagna noodles were so over cook they lost their form and became more of a mush.  The salad was good.  The dips were good.   The pita was soggy (yucky) and the garlic bread was missing a lot of butter so it was more like old french bread.  The baklava was SALTY more than sweet (most of it hit the garbage) and the cheese cake was decent but it could have come from any grocery store freezer.     The overall food experience can be summed up by stingy with a price tag that demands SO much more.  the service was seriously lacking thanks mostly to the driver that made me feel bad for giving them business as a twisted turn of events.   I cater about 30 times a year minimum and I've had some of the most greatful owners you can imagine who hand deliver the food and make sure all the details of it are perfect (I don't always cater with typical catering companies) so being berated is something that sets this place apart but that's about it and I had to look up the name to even review them here as they were that memorable."}
{"text":"I ordered online and it arrived 15 min quicker then the time I was quoted.  The delivery guy was friendly. The pizza was hot fresh and crisp ( not soggy like some take out pizza ) the crust was deep dish ( you have the choice between that and thin crust )   Lots of toppings and the cheese tasted like real cheese - not processed which I cannot stand.   One thing to note - the delivery guy said they were open until 3 am and 5 am on weekends. The hours listed here are incorrect."}
{"text":"Is zero stars possible?  This place is on my personal embargo list for one main reason. Once we were offered a half order of fettucini alfredo for our young son which seemed nice but on a subsequent visit the request was denied. No problemo manie - we went next door to Borne Giorno who was very accomodating to the half order request.  Keep walking and go next door! Later Manie!"}
{"text":"Located in DT, in the trendy good area from what I heard.  Was here for work last year, and can verify they're authentically Greek lol.  Remember their loaded pizza, all meat, was generous portions.  used www.orderit.ca  They even deliver during lunch, a rarity it seems like here, but only in DT.  For evenings, they deliver a lot further, and get this: til 3am on Fri/Sat.  And here's the extra star: they accept AMEX."}
{"text":"This pizza is very good, greek style pizza!! Mmmmmmmm!!! Keep your soggy foldy thin crap the greeks make the best za in my books.  Service was ok. Not bad not good, Saganaki excellent, pizza excellent. I have been before and will be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the appetizer platter and lamb chops at 2am. Both were good. Place isn't one of the cheaper ones around, but it's good food late at night. They deliver till 5am on Friday and Saturday. Till 3am Sunday-Thursday. Only place in town to deliver this late (boosted it from 4 to 5 stars in my book). Justifies paying the higher price, if ordering late at night when other places stop delivering."}
{"text":"I moved here from Toronto, soo you KNOW I know what I'm talking about when it comes to food ;)   I'm also vegetarian and veg options are unfortunately severely limited in Calgary (but understandable, and I'm not complaining).   Soo one hungry night I found myself craving a calzone or, even better, panzerotti like I used to get back home in Toronto. Unfortunately options to satisfy my craving were few and far between. Luckily Manie's was there to save the day.   I ordered a cheese and mushroom calzone and it was absolutely delicious. If they did panzerotti (basically a fried calzone - calzones are merely baked) it would be even better but this more than hits the spot.   Ignore these absolutely idiotic and offensive one star reviews. Unless someone actually got food poisoning from somewhere, there's no need for a one star review, nor any need to call the people that run this place \"hacks.\" I pity the spouses and partners of such close-minded horrible people! I suppose their existence is its own negative karma however"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for too many years - woke up at 4am craving pizza, did the whole hum and haw thing for half an hour, called Manies, and 30 minutes later I'm full and happy. Their pizza is Greek style, which makes sense for a Greek Pizzaria. Still some of the best pizza in the city, for a decent price, and delivery until 5am on weekends. I've only had their pizza, but it's fantastic, today as much as 20 years ago."}
{"text":"Pizza order arrived with two different delivery guys which they were quite sorry about. Hey it happens right ? I found their meat lovers pizza relatively bland while full of hearty ingredients any guy would appreciate. I don't feel the price justified the product but I would try another type of pizza to see if they were better in other areas."}
{"text":"It was lunchtime on a weekday and surprisingly the restaurant was almost empty.  Yet, the food a while to cook, about 15-20 minutes.  My chicken souvlaki in a pita came with tomatoes, onions, and tzakziki and a caesar salad for less than $10 which was a great value.  The dressing on the salad was a little too much but it was good otherwise.  I also liked my pita as it was very filling and Delicious and I wasn't able to finish it.  My colleagues' meals looked good as well, and the portion sizes were decent.  The food gets a 4 star rating but the service and the wait time pulls the rating down.  I would definitely be back though."}
{"text":"We got take out from here for our first night in Calgary since I was under the weather. We ordered a medium pizza, Greek salad & a couple of their sandwiches. The food was so fresh & so delicious! I could tell the pizza was freshly made & it was quite addictive. Great intro to Calgary food so far!"}
{"text":"Maines was a pleasant surprise.  I took my wife here for date night.  She had the lamb and I had the prime rib.  The prime rib was HUGE and her lamb was quite flavourful.  It came with a salad and it was on a huge heaping plate. I'm really glad to be in the neighborhood because we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The calamari was very good but the texture was a bit like it had been pre battered then cooked again but still very good. The Caesar salad was very well done and simple. We didn't eat the croutons though. The Greek salad was very good too. We both had the prime rib. My friend had the rice and potatoes and I had veggies instead. Both were very good. I was so surprised at the low ratings and how empty the pace was. The food was so good and the service was friendly. Clearly authentic. The tzatziki was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Calgary last month staying at the Holiday Inn. My friend and I usually get Trio's Pizza, when we stay here, but I was completely disappointed, when I learned that it had closed down! They had, hands down, the best pizza ever. And I stayed in denial for at least 15 mins, looking in the phone book to see if maybe they had moved or something. I didn't know what to do, because I was starving, so I looked in the Holiday Inn guide, and I saw an ad for Manies Pizzaria.   The ad said that Manies Pizza was voted #1 by readers of the Calgary Sun, so I figured it must be good. I ended up ordering a pepperoni, mushroom, and green pepper pizza. I questioned the guy on the phone, when he told me the total price was $18.50, because in the Holiday Inn guide it said it was only like $15. He said that it was a really old menu. They should seriously get that changed.   The pizza took a while, but the delivery guy was really nice. I was surprised that the pizza box was so heavy, since it was only a 10\" pizza, so I thought it must have really thick crust. I was wrong. The pizza had a fairly thin crust, but it was piled with LOTS of pepperoni. It was thickly cut, deli style pepperoni that tasted quite good, but it was way too much meat for me. If it wasn't for all that meat, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more. The pizza wasn't greasy at all, but the bottom of the crust was soggy; I guess from being inside the box.   Overall, it was okay. It wasn't so good that I am craving to have it again, but next time I stay at the Holiday Inn, I'll probably order it again--I'll just go for a veggie pizza instead."}
