{"text":"I'm very disappointed in our meal as we've been to this restaurant many times since it opened on Monkland. First off, service was very slow, perhaps because there is only 1 waitress for the entire restaurant and 1 cook, albeit a small place.  The only white wine available tastes like dep wine. Fluorescent lights took away from what once was a cozy environment. After waiting 45 mins our Bibimpaps were served and you would think they would be delicious and fresh. Not at all - they were bland yet extremely spicy. Maybe the beeping microwave about 20 times prior wouldve been a sign...1/2 of the bowl was filled with soybeans, scant traces of meat and a couple leaves of lettuce, no egg and lots of rice. After complaining, we were offered a replacement for takeout which we took along with the bland portions. Fried egg this time! (totally cooked, I left it behind) Maybe I can do something with it at home, add some sesame oil and more vegetables? I don't know, I paid 80 worth of rice and soybeans and felt like sh!t.
This place used to be rock solid.
Will not return. What a shame."}
{"text":"Satisfactory but unexceptional.

I had the vegetarian bibimbap. I've had better, but it was okay. I didn't receive the usual arrange of kimche that I've come to expect at Korean restaurants before my meal.

Atmosphere was non-existent. A TV playing Korean musical performers played silently, while nondescript music played over the sound system."}
{"text":"Continued Adventures in Korean Food in Montreal! I ate with a friend who had recently gone to Seoul, Korea. When I arrived, to my amazement, it was across the street from Hwang Kum, I realized why I never noticed it, the writing on the sign was not the most visible to me. 

Overall Opinion (short form for those who don't like to read) GO and Try! They even have Korean BBQ for two on the menu!  I thought the food was delicious, and cooked really well. I personally saw some reviews that made me skeptical of the place but I thought it was wonderful! (And that you don't have to sit on picnic tables, they have regular tables.

Inside: A cute cozy restaurant, with 5 tables (3 of them are for 2), standard jazz playing, a piano, and blue guitar on display. On the other side they incorporated bamboo curtains. It's a two women show, one that cooks, other serves. Decidedly, It is really cute. 

Menu: I got to check this out so thoroughly (my friend was 45 minutes late due to traffic) They had a few entr√©es,  some sides, a decent lunch menu, and stews, rice dishes. Dessert was Green Tea Ice Cream.  Drinks they served the Ginseng Wine, Plum Wine, Sapporo... we found out that the SAQ doesn't carry any Korean beers nor some of their other popular alcohol drinks. 

We ordered: frankly too much, but I get to have leftovers today!

Seafood Pajeon (the only kind of pajeon they have) it came crispy, and served on a hot plaque, and it was not too heavy, not greasy, and delicious!

Bibimbap with Chicken and Egg: I really enjoyed the flavours of this one, it was not made too sweet or spicy, most places I know do it with beef only, chicken in it made it very different, as you typically don't think to get larger pieces of chicken in it, but it was nice, with an array of vegetables and rice. 

Ojingeo Bokkum: Spicy stirfried squid with peppers and rice. Spiced just right, she cooked the squid PERFECTLY!  There is nothing more unappetizing than overcooked squid. Minimal chewing is so key! On the side we had rice, that was mixed with something, but I had forgotten to ask what...

We got all our dishes relatively fast, it came with traditional Korean side dishes (Banchan): 

Kimchi was definitely homemade, my friend prefers it spicier, I was happy with it, the only thing we both agreed was that we wished it was a bit older. 

Oijangajji to me it seemed different from the rest, it had a kick to it, but at the same time I actually noticed something that was similar to western pickles. 

They also had 3 other sides that came with it, but due to overwhelming amount of food, I didn't get to try it. The only disappointment was that there were not the bean sprout side dish! (Personal favourite of mine)."}
{"text":"I haven't really had a chance to try any Korean food yet in Montreal, as the Korean food in southern California is beyond amazing, so the expectations for this place were not super high.  

However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the spicy beef bibimbap and the kimchi chigae.  They came with some of the side Korean dishes, kimchi, crunchy kimchi radish, bean sprouts, maybe a bean curd thing, and zucchini.  Mind you, these are not all the typical Korean side dishes, but then again, I noticed its harder to find ethnic ingredients in Montreal.  Spicy beef bibimbap came with deliciously marinated beef, an egg yolk, carrots, bean sprouts, and some kimchi.  The kimchi chigae broth was also quite good, as the pork was tender, and the tofu was yummy.  Everything tastes homemade Korean, so that was a definite plus.  

The decor is ok, there are rocks arranged on the brick wall as Korean words, and the opposite side has Korean wallpaper which I thought was interesting.  The TV plays Korean music that is reminiscent of Psy's music video.

Also the more current address is actually 3441 Rue St. Denis, which is super close to Sherbrooke metro."}
