{"text":"The food is simply exquisite. The ingredients are properly spiced and very fresh! The presentation of their dishes are also done well (which is an added bonus since one does eat with their eyes first). It strikes me as authentic, yet somehow does not stray away too much from Western cuisine.   My only (negative) point is although the staff is nice, there is a language barrier. The staff does not give the impression that they understand anything you're saying to them (whether that be the case of not). Whatever you say, you'll get a confused look in return."}
{"text":"I love going to Yenta, what can I say. It's located in the east end, and offers a wide variety of food that is always made with the freshest of ingredients. My favorite is the curry dishes, if you tell them you like it hot, they'll really give it a kick and spice it up for you. The dishes always have lots of fresh, never frozen veggies and plenty of protein to satisfy any hunger. The yenta soup is a version of won ton soup made from scratch and is very flavorful, I enjoy the lemongrass soup as it has a little more zing to it. The imperial rolls are probably the best I've ever eaten and served with a little salad topped with a peanut dressing (I think) and it is killer! A friend of mine once tried to order a bottle of their signature vinaigrette but they couldn't sell it. Oh well!  I've been there several times for lunch and love the tonkinese soup with grilled pieces of chicken, it's perfection. My husband has even had their chicken wings which were surprisingly awesome too. I can't speak for their sizzling plates cause it's not my thing but I know that they do serve a variety of them but the curry, the lemongrass,  the general tao chicken, the bird's nests and soup dishes are all incredible! The best part is you can bring your own wine. Love it!"}
{"text":"It's a really nice restaurant! The decoration and atmosphere are so nice. Try their crispy noodles! It's very special. Every dish has lots of variety of vegetables. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All in all a great experience! The restaurant was clean, well decorated, and spacious. Service was prompt and staff was pleasant and always willing to answer questions. The pho was quite good, and the beef and chicken dishes had lovely presentation with fresh ingredients and lots of flavor. I would definitely come again!  Also note - we had a bit of difficulty finding the restaurant as there is an entrance through a mall. However if the mall is closed it is just to the right with another separate entrance. I think the restaurant may have been renamed as I didn't see any clear signs with \"restaurant yenta\" written anywhere."}
{"text":"Yenta is my favorite Asian restaurant to go to when I am in the St-Leonard area.   The staff are friendly and service is prompt. The size of the restaurant is large enough to accommodate big groups and birthday parties. There is plenty of parking due to this restaurant being connected to the mall. The restaurant is also accessible from the Carrefour Langelier mall.  The food is always consistent. My favorite dishes to eat are the chicken or beef curry, their signature pad thai and the pho noodle soup.  Yenta is under a new management but the menu is still the same. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves to eat Asian cuisine."}
