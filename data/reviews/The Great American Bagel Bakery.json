{"text":"I was at the D concourse waiting to board my flight to Turks and caicos, I decided to get some bagels before the 3 hour flight. As I was waiting for my bagels and the staff handed it to me and i Iooked at it and noticed that the bagels were burnt. So I decided to go back and asked to get another bagel and they did. Next time check your bagels before taking them to you flight."}
{"text":"Bad cashier bad bad bad! We all know airport customers are always in a run, sleep deprived, hungry and most likely just want to fill up their belly. So here I was deciding a bagel for lunch to eat on the flight. Bagel sandwich makers were nice and swift but the cashier didn't even look at me in the eye and took my money. Gave me a check, didn't say a word and gave me a bagel. Really? A five year old could do a better job."}
{"text":"By the far the worst service staff I've come across, deli meats tasted like they were old and the bagels are worse than shelf bought. Stay away if possible."}
{"text":"First, to give you an idea of my gastronomic needs or level of culinary sophistication: I am happy with a croissant from Jack in the Box.  Second, my mother and son enjoyed their bagels and cream cheese .. even though the \"bagel\" neither looked, tasted nor felt like an actual bagel. As for my highly resistable breakfast: an asiago omlette. The name of it is purely fiction. An \"egg,\" the size, shape and probably taste of a felt furniture pad, made in a microwave, had none of the advertised items actually cooked in it. Instead, the \"roasted tomatoes\" ... were probably roasted about a year or two ago, put in a jar and labelled \"pimentos\" (is my best guess) were congealed in place above the egg disk with a cheese-like item; the \"turkey\" was none other than some thin slices of cold cuts. All in all, a disgrace. THAT sandwich was $6.99, and a small bottle of soda, about $2.70.  I'm giving it 2 stars because my mom and son liked their food. If you check reviews before eating in an airport restaurant, know that there are better choices  nearby--  great muffins and delicious coffee at either Ciao or Starbucks....or if the smell of toast at GABB pulls you, just don't order anything with the furniture pad in it."}
{"text":"Wow. Two words that should never be associated with this place: \"Great\" and \"American\". Most definitely the worst bagel sandwich I've ever had in my life and absolutely nothing American about it. I was so hungry when my flight landed and a bacon egg & cheese on an asiago bagel sounded like the perfect breakfast snack before my connecting flight. Turns out I payed $9 for a Walmart quality bagel topped with a soggy yellow sponge, a rubber circle that looked like it should have been sausage, and a slice of cheese that I would have had a hard time giving to my dog. It was a struggle to even put half of the thing down my throat. Next time I'll settle for the squished granola bar at the bottom of my carry-on."}
{"text":"I came here on my early morning flight to NY. The line was long and I wanted a good bagel. I waited in the like and ordered bagel and coffee. I had one bite of the bagel and wanted to spit it out. Go somewhere else for a good bagel."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Two counters workers were in conflict with each other instead of help customers."}
{"text":"Coffee is Seattle's Best but it must be old, or perhaps I don't like Seattle's best as much as I remember. The everything Bagel has the softness of a dinner roll. I'm not a bagel snob and maybe it's just me but I expected a bit more. The customer services was good though."}
{"text":"The employees here are all business, no time for pleasantries, and you had better have an answer right away to their questions or they get very annoyed.  I wanted to add something to my bagel but was urgently herded to the cash register before I could talk to the lady making my bagel.  Maybe they just aren't morning people.  The plus side is  that makes the line move quickly. 

I ordered the Carolina Sunrise (egg, cheddar, bacon) on a cheddar herb bagel.  It looked kind of flat when I opened it up and on the first bite I got a mouthful of dough - The bagel was not cooked all the way through!  I wish I had taken a picture. The eggs are standard plasticky bagel eggs.  You are better off going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. At 9:30 in the morning they were out of all breakfast sandwiches. I ordered tea. They handed me hot water and pointed to the \"selection\". No black tea of any kind - only decaf fruit teas. They said \"oh sorry - we are out of that\". I asked for a toasted bagel with butter. Got a barely toasted bagel with margarine. Nasty. And no sincerity or apologies from management. Skip this place and go to the bakery down the other hallway."}
{"text":"This place looked great as did the menu.  On a layover at the airport, my wife and I decided to grab a breakfast bagel here.

It was okay, but did not match our expectations.  We had omlette bagels.  Eh . . ."}
{"text":"I would give a zero star if possible. 

I'm sick and tired of attitude from service personnel. The two women working their tonight (7:15 PM) attitudes sucked. If you are that miserable; get into another line of work. 

The gentleman in front of me asked \"how was your night going ?\"  - Totally ignored, no reply, eye contact or caring. The girl at the register acted as if we were keeping her from a nap. 

My bagel sandwich was horrible: turkey, tomato and lettuce (forgot the mayo). Served with a side a rudeness. 

What happened to customer service and kindness?

To the owner - please fire these miserable heifers. You would be doing everyone a huge favor. Your customers deserve better."}
{"text":"I'd rather go hungry (which I did) than to visit this location again. The line was very long but it was moving pretty quickly. Apparently, that was because their toaster was broken and they were just nuking bagels in the microwave. I didn't find this out until I was next in line and I just happened to overhear a surly employee telling the customer in front of me about the broken toaster. Having already waited in the long line, I decided to just go with it anyway. Bad choice. The bagel tasted way undercooked and doughy from not being toasted. I barely ate half and threw away the rest. I think what really bothers me is the complete lack of caring from the employees. They could have informed the long line of customers that the toaster was broken to give us the opportunity to opt out rather than waiting for nothing. And the cashier was completely slow; didn't even bother to acknowledge I was standing in front of her until I just slid my microwaved bagel at her for payment. She never uttered a word to me. 

Bottom line: avoid this place."}
{"text":"My breakfast bagel tasted okay. Service was okay too. Took them awhile to realize I was there, and then I felt as if my presence was a bit of an inconvenience for them. After that first impression, they were nice enough. It's all around an okay place, and maybe even good if in a rush. Just order something basic and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Good cheap choice for quick breakfast in the run through the airport."}
{"text":"Terrible. Toasted is cold and can they spare the cream cheese? If I searched really hard I could find a microscopic white smear. Do yourself a favor and walk on by."}
{"text":"Closed early per the employees decision. Lots of frustrated customers who were trying to grab a quick bite before boarding late night flights - us included."}
{"text":"Brought a panini here and it was terrible! 

Pass this quick service food service as they are unable to make a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, what to say here. Well the good news is they passed their most recent food sanitation inspection because the certificate is on the wall. The menu looks inviting until you realize everything tastes the same. The staff could care less, appear sloppy, and throws the sandwiches on to a Panini press. Once your sandwich is ready it is wrapped up and handed to you. Be careful when you open it, mine was scalding hot!  So hot that whatever flavor was in the ingredients was lost in translation."}
{"text":"EH not so great! 

$15 for 4 bagels. Not worth it it my opinion. I guess, maybe its an east coast...or everything but the West coast thing? Or just in airport since they know u have a limited amount and time and jack up all the prices on crappy food???  I have no idea. But i love my bagels. I could eat bagels for each meal of the day. Yes, that's how much. So lemme tell u what iiiiiii think.

I ordered 4 asiago bagels toasted with plan cream cheese. Easy order. Nothing fancy. But definitely not worth $15!!!! Wat the heck! If I had more time, and had not waited in a long line, I woulda wanted my money back!  I have paid $2 for a little bit smaller bagel in downtown SJ, by my old college, in a shop that was probably the size of a small studio apartment with 2 tiny lil ovens....and despite all that... it tasted way better and I would totally pick it hands down, anyday!

The \"great\" american bagel bakery...more like great fail."}
{"text":"Tammy, the person taking orders here, is one of the worst human beings to interact with. No need to go into detail, but I am sure if her manager observed her behavior for 5 minutes, he/she would agree with all the customers that she should not have a job in the customer service industry

Great asiago bagel though!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly Chesesteak Panini. Spent the next four hour flight puking and having diarrhea. Two days later, still suffering from diarrhea. $12.95 for that sandwich and a bottle of water. You tell me if it was worth it. If this awful business also made you sick, please report it to the North Carolina Department of Public Health."}
{"text":"$3 for a shitty bagel with hardly any cream cheese on it.  Not surprised, airport food blows 99% of the time."}
{"text":"Got a bagel sandwich and a bagel. They looked and sounded great, but were just lacking flavor or anything to make me happy to eat there. 

The asiago omelet looked like a bagel with a couple sandwich ham slices put inside with some fake egg and cheese. There was some flavor from the meat, but it was bland and the bagel itself was dry and flavorless. I was looking for some Tabasco or something to give it some flavor but couldn't find anything and just trucked through it. For $7 you could probably do better at the  central food court area.

Also got the jalapeño cheese bagel with cream cheese. It was supposed to be toasted, but it was pretty mushy still. The cream cheese was whipped which I liked, and was spread on heavy. It was too much for me so I scrapped some off, but I can appreciate a healthy serving for those who want that much. Also, there were other flavors of cream cheese if you want. There was some flavor, but I'm not sure getting a non plain bagel for more than a 50% increase is worth it. But it's a good option for a cheap breakfast item at the airport.

They don't have cups for water, only selling bottled water, but water fountains are right next to the shop. Coffee is refillable. I wonder if I could get my bagel double toasted next time... I'll have to ask."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a layover for a quick lunch. I tried to get a Cuban panini but was told by the woman behind the counter \"we aren't doing panini's now\".

Settled for a turkey club on an everything bagel. Had to repeat to them 4 times that I didn't want tomato or mustard and my sandwich still came out wrong (they forgot the bacon). Didn't think I needed to specify that in a club sandwich. 

The sandwich was fine for an airport turkey sandwich, except they botched my order despite me telling them what I wanted multiple times."}
{"text":"Food was okay.... I got the chicken Caesar on Asiago...

The sandwich maker seemed to busy doing something to notice me, but there was no one in front of me... Then she said hi, but it was another minute till she took my order... The sandwich came faster then expected but then waited for the male cashier to cash me out... He seemed to be busy but, again, with what is a mystery. I got paid and got out... No one said have a nice day or anything of that sort...

The bagel was okay... But it was cold and reminded me of SubWay... Just on a bagel... It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great. It's good if you have a short lay over, but don't like great customer service and you don't really have taste buds either... 

If your in Terminal E and are looking for a place to eat make a right towards the main terminal, avoid terminal D, it's a food-barren desert.... I just ran into the dead end and had to get something... It's a 2.5 star... Unfortunately I have to round up."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast sandwich here before catching a flight to Puerto Rico. Overall it wasn't too bad, but really lacked flavor. My wife ordered soup and even though it was  pre-made it took about ten minutes to serve. It didn't really look like the people who work there knew what they are supposed to do. Chaos. I'll try something else the next time I fly through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Maybe a little better than their average rating but certainly nothing more than A-OK.  Service kinda sucked and the price was high but my bagel was toasted properly and clearly was very fresh.  I would have preferred an onion bagel but the closest they had to offer was an everything bagel.  Lox was about right also but nothing really outstanding.  The place was something of a shambles too but I'm sure that changes day to day.  

If I had more time I would have found something better,"}
{"text":"Employees are rude, expect you to know their secret bagel language when ordering.  I understand it can get busy at times, but please realize I am giving you money and if I ask a question, it does not deserve a \"foreign language remark to your coworker\", yeah I understand the Pakistani Urdu language insults, you racist dumb wits."}
{"text":"airports love to do one thing, kick your ass.

i bought a mediocre bagel sandwich for $7.50 at the great american bagel bakery while waiting for my flight from charlotte, nc to san francisco, ca.

sad thing is, i would have had to pay $7 for a meal on us airways. but that's another yelp review all together."}
{"text":"Firstly, the employees despite being slammed with a wrap around line were gracious and quick to get customers through the line. But if you just want a bagel and schmear maybe find someplace else. They have every right to charge you $1 to add cream cheese, as it's a slab stuck between two pieces of slightly (and I do mean *slightly*) toasted bread. I understand you have to pay for convenience at the airport, but $6 bucks for warmed bread and a slab of cream cheese... maybe their sandwiches are more worth it. But as for the modest breakfast I was hoping for, not a winner."}
{"text":"Very pleasant people. All very friendly. I had a sunrise with a cinnamon bagel. It was okay. The bagel was much larger than the egg, cheese, and sausage that came with it. Not proportional at all. The bagel itself was okay. It was lightly toasted but the bagel wasn't soft. The ingredients felt like they got it from McDonald's. It's not a bad place to get some breakfast food. Probably cheaper than other alternatives in the airport but still expensive for a bagel. I wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this 3 stars, only because I didn't like the pepperoni pizza bagel I had. I thought it tasted nasty. But that's just one of many available options and if I happen to be in Charlotte airport, I might try something else from here. The staff was pleasant and informative.

Kinda mad expensive for \"bagels\" but then again, it's in an airport, you know?"}
{"text":"There was no one in like when I arrived to purchase just a cup of coffee yet I stood in line for a good couple minutes before the two girls who were behind the counter even acknowledged my presence. They then told me that I had to go to the register to order my coffee and they couldn't help me. I moved down to order my overpriced cup of airport coffee only to watch the women who was \"making\" my latte using an automatic machine to smell the cup several times as I waited an outrageous amount of time listening to the two counter girls talk about how \"dope\" something on Facebook was while I could clearly see a dirty serving line that was in desperate need of cleaning. If you want overpriced coffee go ahead to Starbucks across the way. This place was DISGUSTING and extremely UNPROFESSIONAL. Stay far away."}
{"text":"Needed something portable and filling take on board an 8-hour flight out of Terminal D.  This place is conveniently right at the cul-de-sac.  Line was long (everyone else had the same idea) but moved pretty fast. Decided on roast beef and cheddar sandwich on sourdough \"baguette\" (more like a roll). Ingredients were good quality, roll was soft and chewy, inexplicably well pressed (like mashed with the heel of the hand). Decent sandwich, touch expensive for its size (over $8), but you're trapped at the end of Terminal D, whatdya gonna do? Held up pretty well when I pulled from my carry-on and ate it 6 hours later."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that my review might be a bit harsh since I'm a huge bagel fanatic. I live in New York City, where bagels are made with magic and love. 

So for this place to use the word BAGEL and GREATEST in the the name... was BOLD!!!!
This bagel was mediocre at best. I didn't even finish it. I was so appalled. Who do they think they are??!!?!"}
{"text":"Everything bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese hit the spot!  Bagel had good flavor consistency."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the other reviews before getting food here.  I had the panini and was totally disappointed with it.  Basically its a roll or bagel with a hole cut in it and ham rolled around cheese stuffed into it.

Also the service, when I arrived there was about 4 people talking and just looking at me.  I had to ask them \"are you open\".

Expensive and food is orrible !!  If you are reading this before going don't bother its not great and I wish I had read the reviews first."}
{"text":"On my way to Chicago, my layover lead me to the Charlotte, North Carolina airport. With just a short amount of time and somewhat overwhelmed at the size and bustle of the airport, chose the most reasonably priced and yet optimal opportunity of enjoyment in a hurry. 

I decided to go with the Tomazzo Pizza Bagel, which was not on display but was \"retrieved\" for me. In my haste to return to my appropriate gate, delayed the time in which to eat my meal. 

By the time I did eat it, 32,000 feet in the air, 30 mins later, it was cold and probably not as good as it would have been warm and fresh out of the oven. Nonetheless, served its purpose and was a satisfying choice at the NC airport."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review, because I had one of the best salads ever at this place, but it was also one of the most disgusting places I have ever been into. 

I ventured over to TGABB after walking through the terminal at Charlotte Douglas looking for anything remotely health to eat. After struggling to find something, not thinking a bagel place would do it, I noticed that TGABB also makes fresh salads. I ordered the greek, and they make it right in front of me with all of my requested items on it. It was fresh and tasty!

Now, I go to pay and am afraid to put down my handbag because the counter is dirty, and then I go to the condiment area to get a straw and napkins and my feet are sticking to the floor. YUCK! There were no seats available so myself, and two co-workers sit at the end of someone else's table. I was afraid for my suitcase and bag to be on the floor, but had no where else for them. My suitcase has rolled through LaGuardia and it doesn't get any worse than that, so certainly my case can handle this floor. 

So, I deduct stars for the hot mess of a place it was, and then add a star for the delish and fresh salad."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the greatest disappointment of my life.  After waking up at 2 am and traveling on a hangover with no breakfast, then experiencing a delayed flight, I was very excited when i noticed the jalapeño cheddar flavored bagel when walking by this bagel spot.  Sadly, i would have preferred cat food to this bagel.  No flavor whatsoever, and so flat i think the girl sat on it to heat it up.  It was gross and made get paranoid about why it was gross.  Did two people sit on it?  Did someone squish it under an armpit?  During the onset of this inevitable nausea, I then realized-HEY!  Wheres the jalapeño and cheddar?  Ohhhh, it must be that pink squishy thing protruding from two ends of the bagel that tastes like a gummy bear. 

Maybe the coffee will be good!  NO IT WON'T.  Seattle's Best Coffee tastes like the worst coffee ever made, in any city.  My palm tree's dirt water could produce a tastier cup of java.  Luckily theres a Starbucks across the way."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this bagel option at CLT.  

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book."}
{"text":"While passing through on my way to San Francisco this was a nice choice for a breakfast sandwich. I ordered a turkey club panini which was pretty good-fresh, hot and hit the spot. I also got a green tea. The line moved pretty fast but I was able to walk right up for service. By time I was leaving, the line was pretty long. There is a nice selection of bagels, fresh fruits, yogurt, salads, drinks, etc. Prices:  $8.99 for a panini- kind of the norm for airport over priced food."}
{"text":"Fine stop to grab a bagel to take on your flight. 

Service was fast, although strictly business. 

Why charge an extra $1 for an asiago bagel? 1) Because they can, 2) Because airport restaurants like inflating prices. 

Overall, good bagel to feed my on-the-go tummy."}
{"text":"Steer clear of here -- unless you want your time wasted and if you wanna be annoyed like the workers are. The girl making food around 6:00pm on Dec. 19 didn't even know the menu. I watched as she grumpily served the others before me. My turn. Okay, my voice is soft, but do I need to explain where the item is on your menu? She mumbled she would check the back for ingredients and never came back. Of course since I was the last in a line. So no direct consequences. 

The cashier girl noticed me stranded & checked the kitchen for her coworker a couple times. Too much time wasted, so I ordered the easiest item instead. As she rung it up, another girl comes into the scene saying, \"Geez, everyone is going in break!\" Great. And the bagel & cream cheese was gross.

Isn't it a basic work skill (not even skill) to ask your co-worker to take care of the order when you gotta leave? Steer clear. Bad vibes here."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but nothing special. Service is quick but they are not friendly.  They mumbled their questions and got irritated when you didn't answer right away. I had to keep asking them to repeat what they said. The majority of customers sitting in their dining room were actually customers from the chicken place next door... wished I had gone there; it looked so good."}
{"text":"Slick & quick.

Average bagels at an average price.

Not bad, really, for airport food."}
{"text":"Got a ham, egg and cheese on jalapeños bagel. It was surprisingly good. Bagel was baked fresh and had a nice chewy texture. Ham, egg and cheese were good. At least they looked fresh, non greasy and real not like the fake stuff at some other fast food joints. It's $6 for a breakfast bagel. Maybe it's a bit overpriced but then it's a fair price for an airport."}
{"text":"The only fast food place around huge cul-de-sac in the terminal.  If you only got a few minutes before your flight not other choices are close enough for a hot bagel.  Naturally, they are grossly overpriced.  Due to number of people in line orders get confused, etc.  Bagels themselves are lousy.  Do yourself a favor and eat on the promenade before the terminals."}
{"text":"Eh.  Not the greatest. I got the pesto chicken. Bread is kinda soggy. Chicken is dry. The woman working is pretty unfriendly. It's honestly not that hard to put on a fake smile. I'd probably try this place again but in a different location."}
{"text":"Bagel not even toasted. Therefore, cheese not even melted. Tiny little egg. The whole sandwich is just mush."}
{"text":"This place should fire every employee and start over with ppl that enjoy living. To be located in an airport where ppl are constantly moving about and perhaps looking to buy food, this place is strategically located near the end of Gate B so you have limited options. 

And this is not my first time experiencing this barley alive, no emotion staff. I've stopped here before and thought I could turn them around by killing them with my southern politeness however these ppl are either zombies in a work release program or have just given up on joy (I think it's a combo of both). 

Example: (me) hello, what type of pork comes in the new Cuban sandwich, sliced pork or pulled pork (lifeless sandwich maker) [shrugs shoulders up and down] 
(me) okay, so that means you don't know? Alrighty then, I'll have a turkey sandwich. With Swiss or provolone 
(lifeless sandwich maker) which one? Swiss or Provolone [scowl] 
(me) Swiss and I think you have mayo and mustard but I'll have neither but I will take lettuce and tomato. (lifeless sandwich maker) [walks away never to be seen again until my sandwich is delivered at check out] 
(me) thanks
 (lifeless sandwich maker #2) [crickets] 

Close this down and install a vending machine"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here eating the worst bagel (if you want to call it that) I've ever had. It is supposed to be an egg and cheese bagel on jalepeno cheddar bagel. The bagel is thin with no jalapeños. The piece of egg is half the size of the bagel and the cheese is not melted, just a piece of Kraft slices. Awful."}
{"text":"Bagel was okay. Service was fine. Meh."}
{"text":"It's a bagel place. In an airport. In North Carolina. If you want an authentic bagel, catch a plane to Manhattan.

Generally speaking, these aren't bagels, they're bread-flavored donuts."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Ordered Chx Parm sandwich.  Service was pretty quick, waited only a couple minutes.  But it was so hot I couldn't eat it- and when eating at an airport I didn't have much time before my flight was boarding.  In addition to being scorching hot, it was also just a mess with the sauce and cheese.  And the to go bag did not include utensils so I tried to tear off a few pieces but between the temp and being so messy most went in the trash.  A shame because it could have been a  great sandwich."}
{"text":"after a red-eye from phx to charlotte (connecting to jamaica), we were famished and this was the only thing open in the charlotte airport. 

usual high-priced items and not quite enough, but it was tasty enough to satisfy until we arrived at the all-inclusive glutton fest."}
{"text":"Very poor service at the sandwich counter. Four girls working at a snails pace. I call this LAZY. One complained that all she wanted to do was be home and this wasn't her schedule in the first place (I guess she was nice enough to pick up a shift)
The other three ladies are just walking around without a care in the world. I asked for turkey instead of ham on my Italian sandwich, she gave me the nastiest look like I was crazy but said Okay. I get on the plane.. and surprise. She didn't put the turkey and instead ham. Guess she really didnt care to listen.
What should take under 10minutes to order a Togo bagel took almost 20. I should have known to eat here when I saw the line around the corner and no one moving. But it was my only chance to eat an actual meal before boarding my flight.

As for actual taste, the Italian bagel was good."}
{"text":"By far the worst \"panini\" I have ever had in my life.

My boyfriend and I barely made it through customs in enough time to catch our connecting flight, so we had to grab a quick bite to eat before boarding. Our order of 2 turkey & \"crispy\" bacon paninis along with a bottled water totaled $23. 

The bacon was extremely pale, finger length and flavorless. Aside from very faint grilled marks on the hero, I'm not sure where the \"panini\" comes into play. More like a warm turkey sandwich that. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"The bagel I got here was nasty, the service was SO SLOW and rude. My companion got a bagel with butter, and the butter was all gross (like when butter melts and re-solidifies getting that weird grainy texture). While I was in line, multiple people brought their food back up to the counter because there was something wrong with their order. Do yourself a solid and stop somewhere else."}
{"text":"Doesn't hold a bagel to Einstein's."}
{"text":"After a whole week of conch fritters, conch ceviche, numerous room service meals and seemingly bottomless Bahama Mamas, it's time to go back to eating normal, healthful type food. 

Plus, I only have $20 left in my wallet.

This full service bakery is located at the airport's B wing. I ordered a grilled Chicken on a multigrain bagel with lettuce, tomato and mustard. With a fruit cup and  bottled water, total was $15.     

I split that meal with my hunny. 

Yes, we were still hungry. 

So, there's this fried chicken joint next door..."}
{"text":"Ugh the worst. I honestly didn't even know that bagel shops could be this bad.

I was absolutely starving when I walked into this shop, so you would think that I would appreciate any food that I could get... but even my empty tummy couldn't stomach this horrid bagel. I ordered an egg and cheese on a whole wheat bagel, and honestly, after finishing my bagel, I felt nauseous. Something about the taste just felt wrong and made my stomach feel awful.

First off, food isn't fresh. At all. Cheese slices look totally processed, and the eggs were pre cooked into patty-shape. There wasn't enough egg or cheese to fill up the bagel. 

Servers are like a machine, unfriendly and unhelpful. Rude and wanted to rush everyone out as quickly as possible.

Price is also way too high for what you're getting. Save yourself the trouble and please just get your breakfast sandwich somewhere else. Starbucks is better right next door."}
{"text":"Verdict: The unfortunately sub-par and overpriced bagel co.

My cinnamon crunch bagel was rather sad. A bagel shouldn't make you sad unless it's because you want one and can't get it. Unlike the name, there was no crunch. Zero. It had the inside texture of a cinnamon bread, rather than a bagel. It was dry and felt like a bagel you've frozen and reheated later that week.

All this for the low price of $4.32 after tax. The cinnamon crunch is one of their special bagels so there's an up-charge. I'm hard on my breakfast and this company because I've had better bagels countless times for $3.00 less than what they charge. Airport or not, this was a bad showing and far from \"great.\""}
{"text":"I go here almost every time I depart from CLT and pick up a caesar salad on a \"bagel\". The bagel isn't a bagel, it's a poor excuse for one that's essentially bread. Overall, the sandwich is tasty, although after looking at the nutrition, I will now think twice about getting this. The bagels that you order are decent, especially for an airport. Service is alright, usually above average. Prices are what you would expect an airport--expensive, expensive, expensive.

Note: I go to the GABB in Terminal B."}
{"text":"Bad Bagels (if you can call them that), rude staff and inflated stadium prices because you are trapped with limited options. How is it that I can get a better sandwich in the Philly Airport (a real city) for way less money at Au Bon Pain and the staff is friendly also?  I have tried multiple times thinking my last experience was an exception and I am always left disappointed. Keep your money, stay hungry and wait until you get to your destination."}
{"text":"This bagel store is a lifesaver! They are located in Charlotte, NC airport...which is usually my connect spot on my flights from ATL to NYC...Its not just breakfast...They serve anything on a bagel...They are very quick...assembly style...you place your order...by the time you get to register and pay...youre order is ready...I really enjoy the ham and cheese on sesame bagel....ummm...yummy...place is clean...staff is friendly...and prices still cheaper than NYC!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't catch the Bitter Betty service from the quick-working assembly staff other Yelpers have experienced. That said, the bagel itself left much to be desired.

Parboiled and severely under-toasted, the jalapeño-cheddar finished matte, pale and about as toothsome as squashed Wonder Bread. Where's the cheddar, or the jalapeño for that matter? Where's the beef, Wendy's Lady?

Sausage and egg guts hung limp and cool; the cheese re-solidified to a waxy plank. Sustenance-quality is fine at $3 a pop (haaaay Dunks), but I expect more from a $7 sandwich.

Avoid the breakfast rush, as they seem to be focused on getting the toast done quickly instead of thoroughly. At least they do it smiling!"}
{"text":"Can we say PIZZA BAGEL!!!!!! YUM!!!!

Ok so I have not had a pizza bagel in years and as soon as I walked past here I knew what my dinner was going to be.  I only had about 15 min in between flights so I was not able to sit down and enjoy the entire feel of this restaurant but I got it to go.

So as I was reading the menu and my eyes landed on Chicken Park...I thought \"that is like a Pizza Bagel with chicken....SCORE\" Yes, i actually thought that =)

I went with the Chicken Parm and it was messy as all get out but so worth having sauce drip from the sides of my mouth and killing 5,232 napkins =)  So gooooood!!  

It was piping hot when I opened it so I had to let it sit for a moment and during that moment I swear the kid across from me was starring at me as if I had drool all over my chin.  Ok, Ok maybe there was drool on my chin =)

The bagel was amazingly fresh and chewy on the inside but a lovely golden brown on the outside.  They did not skimp on the cheese either and it was melted to perfection.  I think I finished the huge bagel delight in under 2 min =)  More reason for people to stare haha.

It was a lovely treat in a lovely airport, I was very pleased!!!"}
{"text":"grabbed a jalapeno cheddar breakfast bagel which was okay but not the best...friendly staff, but as always at any airport, ridiculous prices.....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"My stop at The Great American Bagel Company was surrounded by an extremely frustrating day with an airline. I had just learned my return trip would also require me to spend 5 plus hours hanging out in the Charlotte airport. Being faced with what to eat again (that was somewhat healthy and inexpensive) I stopped in at this \"restaurant\". I thought the service and price was fair to good. Once I removed the meat (I'll get to that in a second) my sandwich was pretty good and had a generous portion size. The reason that I cannot rate this place higher is frankly they screwed up my order. I asked for an egg sandwich without meat but a big slab of it was on it anyway. I was just too tired to complain. In a nutshell, if you want something that will fill you up that is not fast food it is worth a stop. Just make sure if you don't eat meat to check your order 1st before diving in."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty decent for airport food. You can grab the premade stuff or get something custom, and on a layover I got one of the Chicken Parmigiano ones on the Tomazzo bread. It was a pretty darn good sandwich and I got a delish cookie to go with it. Lots of staff working hard to get through the line quickly and friendly cashier who reminded me that chocolate melts in the same bag next to a hot sandwich, which was actually a smart thing for her to point out for me since I was throwing things together. It was carby and I felt fat after, but it was tasty and I would have felt worse eating fried chicken and biscuits next door. They do regular bread sandwiches if bagels aren't your thing too or fresh salads where to pick the fixins. Not too shabby, layover dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is made to order for the most part (eggs were precooked).  Hot, fast breakfast that tasted pretty good. Surprisingly fast turnaround as well."}
{"text":"now before anyone jumps to conclusions. I've had many layovers in Charlotte. this place is consistently the worst. horrible food (yes they ruin bagels) and the worst service in Charlotte airport. go anywhere but here. I'd rather starve then eat here again."}
{"text":"I mean why am I even reviewing airport food like I'm not going to overpay to be under-served.

I've been twice in a weekend over connections. Both times they were understaffed. One person making food and one person checking out (there's two registers). The food quality would have been better if she took more than four seconds to make my food but I don't know that I blame her if she's THE ONLY PERSON MAKING FOOD."}
{"text":"I ordered the cinnamon crunch bagel with a cream cheese spread. FYI: A bottle of water is over 3$. 

The cinnamon crunch bagel is a great pick me up. It's warm and toasted. It's so warm that the cream cheese melts just enough that the cream cheese becomes super soft. The cinnamon is strong with every bite. There are big chunks of sugar crystals that are a perfect match with the cinnamon spices. The bagel itself is soft and moist. The bagel is more like a bread than a bagel. The bagel is buttery that it reminds me of soft bread."}
{"text":"Red eye, dazed and confused and what is the first thing I want, some decent breakfast is all I ask for. I walked past most lunch and dinner options to find the Great American Bagel Bakery with a decent line near my gate. This restaurant/fast food offers your standard bagel and panini list, nothing too exciting, but hey it smelled great at 7 AM in the morning, so I gave it a go. Grabbed a standard egg and cheese bagel, which ran me over 6 bucks, gotta love airport to go. 

At this point in time I wish I had just gone with a bagel and some cream cheese..better yet stopped and grabbed some fruit and or nuts to hold me over til lunch. I asked for the bagel to be toasted, which apparently means toss in microwave with all ingredients and nuke it. Then wrap three to four times to hide the fact that you did not perform a simple toast. This could be my fault as I was jet lagged and should've paid closer attention. Anyways, the bagel had an odd chewy sensation with the egg being complete rubbish, and I will not even start to complain about the kraft cheese added to this. I am sure the staff could dish out some decent breakfasts with the equipment they have, but it seems the rush has them resorting to being lazy and getting everything out the door per say."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all. The staff moved extremely slowly even when there are a lot of people waiting for their food, and their attitude is poor. Even though I asked for my bagel to be toasted, it was not and was a doughy mass of bread. In almost all cases I have to scrape off additional cream cheese at other bagel shops, but this place barely gave me any cream cheese. They need to drop great from their name."}
{"text":"If you're in a rush and want a tasty bagel sandwich then I highly recommend this place. I gave it three stars just cuz I've got limited experiences with it. The staff was very quick and friendly with their service and my veggie bagel was great. It was about parr with pricing as far as airport food goes.  So swing on by if you're in concours b and have yourself a merry little bagel meal!!!"}
{"text":"Sloppy, un edible,  tasteless mess. I threw it out and I usually eat anything...this was the absolute worst meal I had. Stay away from the parmesan chicken... total waste of money."}
{"text":"At 6 am there are very few options for breakfast in Terminal D. I was pleasantly surprised at how good my bagel was! I would totally eat here again!"}
{"text":"I had never been to North Carolina before my LONG (4 hr) layover on the way to Cozumel.  After the oh-so-lovely red eye from San Diego (no, i didn't get a wink of sleep), I stumbled out of my gate in the fabulous zombie-state looking for some brains to eat.  

Ehem, an Egg McMuffin, rather. Sorry, Night of the Living Dead just entered my mind :)

Anyway, no McDonalds to be found.  Shucks!  And everything I passed was fried and/or in gravy.  Yeah, call me a fruit basket, I'm a long way from home.  But there was Great American Bagel.  No, it's still not the healthiest thing in the world (come on Heather, you wanted McDonalds!) but out of the choices, it seemed safe enough to possible have a satisfying meal.

They have a bunch of breakfast sandwiches they they prepare on spot (not sitting out under a hot lamp), and make bagel deli sandwiches as well.  If you are late connecting a flight, they also have prepared sandwiches before the check out.

Maybe it was the sleep deprivation...maybe it was the insane hunger...but I thought it was pretty good for airport food.  I got a standard egg, cheese, ham sandwich on an everything bagel for $4.86 after tax.  That aint bad!  Personally they could have charged more and gotten away with it.

It filled my hunger, was under $5 and I didn't die afterwards.  That is all I ask of airport food."}
{"text":"It was 6am and we had been in and out of airports. All we wanted was some breakfast while we sat around for 3 hours waiting for our connecting flight. Bagels sounded great, so we thought. 

The staff worked fast but at the cost of good customer service. The female that took my bf's order barely even looked up at him and then totally ignored me. I was inquiring about that jalapeño pizza looking bagel and asked if I could have it toasted. She said, \"no\".  After that I didn't exist. I wanted a sandwich instead but she had already moved on. The cashier started to ring us up but I never placed my order!  I ended up having to get that jalapeño bagel because she handed it to me and walked away.  Our bagels both ended up being giant bricks in our stomach. It was greasy and just poorly made. 

Save yourself a stomach ache and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick breakfast while waiting for my flight.    While i was the only person in line, it took a while for someone to take my order for who knows why.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich on an asiago bagel.  The sandwich was huge and I could only eat half of it.  Price was decent for air airport restaurant and I was able to sit near the window and watch the incoming planes.

Decent place, not like a Panera breakfast sandwich but it was still decent."}
{"text":"The Latte machine is broken. The hot chocolate comes out of a packet. The bagels were not toasted as we asked for...I think the toaster was broken as well. Customer service was horrible and rushed... it's only the morning jeeesh!"}
{"text":"To the employee who ignored me, standing in front of the register while you looked at your phone As another employee flipped off the lights at 2 minutes to 10 PM. Here is the quote after I asked for a panini \" I can give it to you on a bagel, I can't press any sandwiches now, we are closed\". 
  Due to my belief in Karma, (I can not wish you be treated as I was, hopefully not due to the fact that we had different colored skin) I do hope you feel exactly the way I did when you looked me, laughing. You seemed to get a laugh from embarrassing me in front of the other employees.
   I can say I would never disrespect a fellow human, deliberately belittle them and deny them service. Many a day I have stayed behind as a fellow human needed my help.
  You may not know that I work as a psychiatry PA. My job is to help people with their psychiatric difficulties.
  My friend, you are an a$$. Thanks a lot. 
Unfortunately there are no other places to eat, I have to board my flight, not having an evening meal. I will not starve, I have missed meals before. I hope you never have to go without.
Thanks,
Hungry guy in the blue North Face jacket."}
{"text":"Meh.  I had the jalapeno breakfast bagel.  I agree with another poster in that this sandwich had no flavor.  The ham was tasteless.  The sandwich came out flat.  They have some nice looking toppings.  When I asked for jalapeno and tomato on my bagel they said sure, 79 cents for each.  Kidding me?  Nope.  This would have pushed the sandwich over $8, but that isn't the point.  Point is the sandwich was bad and they nickle and dime customers.  So I took coffee business elsewhere and went to starbucks across the way instead of buying it here.  Won't return."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE bagels!!! So whenever I see them available I'm always giving it a try. This place had an awesome selection, but my VERY favorite is the Everything bagel. I was a bit skeptical about the bagel because everything bagels are either hit or miss. I can't understand how a everything bagel is supposed to be everything but is missing salt (I HATE when there is no salt). I thought that they hit me with the okie doke because I couldn't visibly see the salt included, however when I bit into it I tasted it (awesome)!!! The only downfall is that I asked for cream cheese and it wasn't spread evenly. Ok, I admit I'm picky but don't just clump my cream cheese on my bagel. If I'm ever in the airport again I'd definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Dear people flying from Gates D8-13:
As a fellow dissapointed customer, I am sorry you dont have a better option to calm your before your flight. 
My \"grilled cheese sandwich\" was an overpriced and thin disappointment serve by staff that did not wanted to be there anymore and gave you bad service. 
In dissapointment with you."}
{"text":"Most modern airports have a pretty decent selection of restaurants.  Most modern airports look absolutely identical as well, as their selection consists entirely of the exact same chains.  At least here you can get a halfway decent bagel (either with cream cheese or as a breakfast sandwich), along with a drink, and it's not too bad, as this chain isn't found everywhere you look."}
{"text":"My wife and I flew in VERY early in the morning on our way to sail out of New Orleans. We passed up the standard breakfast options that (outside of an airport) serve food through a drive-thru window. The great American bagel bakery was packed, so we figured it must be good - and got in line. Hungry as I was, I didn't blink when handing over $15 for two bagel sandwiches and a coke, but hey. . . we're in an airport. The breakfast bagels were O.K. and they sure cranked them out quick! Overall, I would have to fall in line with my fellow yelpers here and recommend this as a good place to grab a quick bite while passing through."}
{"text":"Horrid, trying place where the employees are slow and unfamiliar with the very basics of their jobs.

Asked for a beef panini. The worker asked what type of bagel we wanted it on.

This place is called the Great American Bagel Company, and it offers only two things besides beverages. 1 Bagels . 2 panini.

To make it worse, one female employee had some long braids which are not permissible at a sanitary eatery.

And worser,  they are so slow. You would think they were crafting lovingly inspired creations back behind the counter. No way. They are flat, thin and lacking the robust quality of the pictures. 

And worstest , this place is part of the North Carolina Beer place, as the employees are going back behind each other's counters. 

We also were completed unaware that the Beer Company serves sandwiches too. Who knew? Not us, because THERE WERE NO MENUS ANTWHERE IN THE RESTAURANT!

We discovered this only after seeing the bartender deliver some. He told us the menus were 'at the bar'. Oh, how useful.

Seriously??

Guess they don't care here because you will not find a more uninspired,  lacklustre group of employees anywhere. 

Ever seen a prison road crew at work, cleaning the highways? They have more on the ball.

The Copper beer was good. We had to go to the bar to order it, while others received table service, plus no one came to check on us ever.

Note to Management if there is one:  Fire all these clowns and hire people who speak and understand English AND KNOW HOW TO SMILE rather than this gloomy, sullen lot who appear to be in a labor camp,  suffering at the hands of their captors ( we assume that's us)."}
{"text":"We were looking around for a breakfast place,near our gate at the Terminal B. I was tired of Starbucks, wanted something savory and I love bagels, so this seemed like a decent place. We got 2 \"everything\" bagels (sesame seeds, poppy seeds, etc), eggs and cheese (Provolone for me and Cheddar for my husband). We also got some OJ. 

The bagels were great, tasty, exactly what I needed. The service was just OK, kinda slow, not very attentive.  They have a small toaster oven so it takes them long to heat the bagels.

It's nice that they have a seating area, so you don't have to eat at the gate, you can enjoy your meal better having a table to eat at. Something we take for granted, but I was thankful food. They have another location at terminal D.
Decent breakfast place."}
{"text":"Worst bagel shop that I've ever been to. I never even thought that this type of service could exist. The employees that work there are the worst, rude and don't acknowledge you or tell you what they have. Never will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the jalapeño cheese bagel toasted with cream cheese.  The bagel didn't taste toasted, it was very soft and not crispy like I prefer.  The cream cheese was good, but because the bagel was so soft it tasted kinda soggy and mushy.  Not my favorite, flavor was lacking."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible grilled cheese panini. Horrible cheese. Barely grilled. Microwaved. $7. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The Great American Bagels are not very great considering they specialize in bagels. And $7 for a basic not so fresh turkey bagel sandwich seems kind of steep.

Next time, I'm going to Concourse C to try the bagel place across from Sbarros."}
{"text":"I don't normally post rants.... but this place is f***ing filthy.  FILTH.  EVERYWHERE.  It seriously looks like someone had a food fight in here, and I'm not sure they should even be serving food legally.  Every piece of upholstery is torn, every table is dirty, and there's trash everywhere.  Hey owner... how about you take at least 2% responsibility for your establishment?  Maybe it's Popeye's fault, but you should probably hold yourself to a higher standard than Popeye's."}
{"text":"I fly in and out of Charlotte a lot and always grab breakfast here, even if it's not at my gate. I love the jalapeño breakfast sandwich-egg, sausage, cheese, on a jalapeño bagel-a delicious and a spicy way to start your day! Service here is usually good and there is always a line wrapped around the corner-so plan accordingly if you don't have a lot of time to catch your flight. I've also had just bagel and cream cheese here and it's also good. I think as grab and go airport good goes-it's pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"I should have read the yelp reviews before eating here.

First, the line was moving extra slow, which gave us enough time to figure out what we wanted. Unfortunately, that didnt hold true because they were out of everything that we wanted (no signs either).  We basically  settled for whatever they had left and the 2 ladies working there seemed completely done with the job. The one making our sandwiches was ignoring other customers, exhaling out rudely, and forgot our sandwiches in the microwave (we later found out that they were also out of ceasar for the chicken ceasar we order but didnt say anything). When we got to the register, the cashier was making comments on how she wished she had a \"leave me alone sign\". Right after that, the sandwich maker came over to the cashier to complain about the customer she was helping (he was calling the american cheese \"yellow cheese\" and this seemed to be the straw that broke the camels back).  We havent been back in the US for an hour yet from out of country and it was sad to see the differences on how WE treat people...

I rate this place 2 stars for the food and 1 star for the horrible customet service.. This was out first and last time at The \"Not SoGreat\" American Bagel & Bakery."}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to my gate. Flying 5 hours direct meant no food while up in the air. Decision to grab a breakfast sandwich here right before my flight was a smart move. 

Jalapeño Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95) - Reasonably priced and decently made. To be honest, I was expecting the sandwich to taste like cardboard but it was nowhere near that. Breakfast sandwich included ham and cheese in a toasted jalapeño cheese bagel. Cheese is standard American cheese, the mass-produced kind. Definitely did more than tide me over during my cross-continental flight."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily rude employees that treat you like you've done something wrong. \"Bagels\" only to those who don't know what bagels are."}
{"text":"I will give it to you that their bagels are pretty delicious by themselves. But I tried to order an egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel, it came out and was extremely greasy. So greasy in fact that I couldn't even finish it. I ate about half of it and then had to push it away. We also ordered a grilled cheese and it came out extremely flat and lacking a good gooey Center. Overall, not that great. It was definitely a shot in the dark given that we didn't have a whole lot of food choices, but we will choose something else next time and pass on the bagels."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about here. I needed something quick before my flight and this was right by my gate so I stopped in.
It looked promising, but the bagel just lacked flavor and proper texture. It was very soft and chewy, and although it was an everything bagel, it barely had any flavor...all I tasted was poppy seed. I had veggie cream cheese and lettuce tomato onion on there. Mediocre bagel from a mediocre place. It is the airport so I wasn't expecting much, but the name isn't fitting of the product. Can't speak for anything else there, but bagels are their main deal."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and I wouldn't call the asiago bagel a bagel as much as I call it some bread shaped like and named a bagel.

The omelet wasn't so much an omelet so much as it was an egg patty with some greasy veggies thrown on/in. It was not fluffy but was heavy and had no real taste. Not sure they even used real eggs.

I give it a solid \"meh!\" and the only real plus was the coffee which is Seattle's Best. Next time, I'll hop over to the Starbuck's just across the way. I suggest you do the same, even if you're not a big Starbuck's fan. They do have sufficient seating - which Starbuck's doesn't - so I guess that's another plus.

1.5 stars is as high as I would go here even with the pluses."}
{"text":"Bagels are a little pricey but taste makes up for it. Fast service"}
{"text":"Bleh. Overpriced ham and cheese panini. Not much ham. Cheese had melted off the bread and was stuck to the wrap. Wheat bread was soggy in the middle and hard on the ends. Sandwich was quite small and waaayyy overpriced. Keep walking."}
{"text":"Got off a red eye flight after a good nights sleep. it was about 7am. I was hungry, but that's nothing new if you know me.  Had a 2 hour layover (ugh!), but even if you're in a rush the service was pretty quick. Grabbed an egg, cheese and ham bagel sandwich. It was early and it hit the spot. The bagel kind of surprised me. Not too thick and tough. It was light, crisp, and easy to bite into. It was soft. 

Oh how the coffee blows. Go to Starbucks down the way.

Impressive view of the sunset coming up over the airfield on this rainy morning. Sit by the floor to ceiling window. Life could be worse."}
{"text":"Really crappy sandwiches. I had the turkey club panini. It was awful. The bread was terrible and soggy. The bacon was a stringy processed piece of garbage. Seriously? There was a line to the place because there is really nothing around that can be quickly fixed. I spent $10.50 on a truly terrible sandwich. I added Jalapeño peppers and they charged me extra?
Crappy food, bad quality ingredients and bad service. You do the math. 
I will never attempt to return to this place."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you want a good breakfast sandwich with egg whites, turkey sausage, hot temperature and something that tastes like food...Do not go here.  Worse food I've had since castor oil..."}
{"text":"I tried their jalapeño cheese bagel n blueberry bagel on my way to Vegas. Both the bagels were soft, bursting with flavors n extremely yum!"}
{"text":"\"excuse me, miss, half of that bagel you just scarfed down over the line (first ew) and then didn't wash your hands after eating (second ew) is still on your face\"

well, that's what I would have said, if she had given me the opportunity to answer more than \"what do you want\" and \"what do you want on it\" before moving on to the next customer. 

luckily, the in the heat of a morning rush dishwasher-turned-prep cook had already thrown my bagel on (to a toaster cranked to such a high speed to \"accommodate\" the line it barely warmed by carbness) and I picked up my jelly from the cashier so the mess of an employee didn't need to touch it.

a couple of breakfast bagel concoction options (if you want it on asiago instead of a plain bagel, $1 more) and strawberry or regular (both full-fat) cream cheese. (really? you're a bagel place and only have two cream cheese options?)

not the greatest way to start your morning - and after you wait forever to place your order, you then have to stand in a long line at the self service coffee station. a lot of places to sit in the morning, though, since the brewery is fairly slow then."}
{"text":"It was nothing special. Airport good odds usually the worst if the worst. It's always over priced because you can't just leave and go   somewhere else. At least, not once you pass security. 

EXPERIENCE:
I check in here for breakfast on my way to Puerto Rico and the line is long which indicated good food. I order a panini with turkey and some sort of cheese I don't remember. The workers seemed extremely tired because there was no energy behind that counter whatsoever. Conversation was to a minimum and I don't even remember being greeted. I was just asked what'll I have.

PRICE:
It must have cost about $7 or $8 for my sandwich. That's not the meal. Just the sandwich. Like I said before, airport for is highly overpriced which would've been give if the food was good.

FOOD:
The sandwich was dryer than 6 day old pack of opened saltine crackers. I nearly choked to death on it. It was so plain. Just meat, cheese and bread that was missing flavor. Worst panini I've had. 

This'd have resembled everything I hate abort airport dining. Long lines, high prices and terrible food. Next time I'll get a bag of skittles. Not the ideal breakfast, but at least I know what to expect."}
{"text":"Super rude employee. Why work there if you're going to be dismissive and making comments to your coworker... i can hear you"}
{"text":"There may be more than one GAB in the CLT airport (I think there's another in the D concourse) but my review is for the one in the B concourse. It is located between the B7 and B9 gates.

At 6:00 AM, they had a great selection of bagels and because this terminal doesn't start rocking for another 45 minutes or so, there was no wait for my order or at the cashier.

I ordered a cheddar herb bagel, toasted, with egg and cheddar cheese. Nice and warm, but maybe it could have gone through the toaster a second time?

Coffee choices seemed limited. I popped across the way and got a Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"The staff was completely rude and yelling at customers. They got my sandwich wrong after specifically telling them exactly what I wanted on it. Will never eat from this place or any great bagel spot again."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Ordered a bagel with cream cheese, the cream cheese was caked on but only on 1/2 my bagel. Also, it was barely toasted. Staff weren't very friendly."}
{"text":"Airport food.  Overpriced, soggy, not very good ham and cheese bagel.  Blech...waste of my money."}
{"text":"Worst bagel in whole America are sold here. DO NOT go EVER. Better eat moist cardboard. That's exactly what they taste like. We orders 2 bagels with egg cheese n bacon. Top of the bagels were literally wet. I don't know why don't people make good food when they charge you they the Fing roof for it. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I didn't have any service problems. I asked a question and it was answered with no issue. I had the Asiago bagel with cream cheese. I get my bagels toasted which always run the risk of being burnt. Here the bagel tasted great, wasn't burnt yet still very soft. If there was a storefront elsewhere in Charlotte I would go back."}
