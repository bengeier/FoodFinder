{"text":"Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the \"unspoken house rules\": 

1. Order first (do not try and sit down).
2. Wait for your food while standing.
3. Find a seat (if one is available).

Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.

My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.

Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: \"you can either sit there or there\", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the \"unwritten rules\" to us.  An \"excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down\" would have sufficed.

So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money."}
{"text":"Even with the strange hours this place deserves 5 stars. Only cash is accepted so be prepared but there is a atm right next door. Offerings range from sweet crepes, savory crepes, paninis and pastries. I've only had the black forest sweet crepe but I can't wait to try out everything else on the menu.It was the perfect size for one person and comes with whip cream and walnuts. I did expect the whip cream to be sweeter but it could of been the sweetness of the chocolate overshadowing that of the whip cream. 
The most outstanding part of the experience was the customer service. I came in 15 minutes before closing and the employees were just as accommodating and welcoming. I even overheard a customer come in asking for coffee and because they didn't have any left since they were about to close, they offered a free cup of tea. That's what I call impeccable service!"}
{"text":"I love this place... I've only had the coffee and pastries but it is SO SO SO much better than Starbucks coffee and I'd much rather support a local business anyway :-) The Chocolate Croissant's are the BEST."}
{"text":"These are the best crepes I've had in Pittsburgh and several other big cities (D.C., Phila., Chicago).  The guy who makes the crepes is a true expert and watching him whip up dozens of crepes is so much fun! I get the egg and cheese crepe with added mushrooms and order with the garlic oil base.  They serve all of the savory crepes with a tiny side salad with mandarin orange slices.  Although it's small, its really a nice addition and the dressing is so good I dip my crepe in it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and the food is always excellent.  However, the rudeness of the staff has finally gotten to me and enough is enough; there are so many other wonderful restaurants in the area that I will have no problem finding somewhere else to spend my money in order to get good food with good service.

My boyfriend and I arrived a little before 2:30pm on Sunday for a late brunch.  The restaurant is open until 4pm and at the time we arrived, there were several tables that were filled with happy patrons eating their sweet and savory crepes.  There was no line and we walked up to the counter and stood off to the side while we discussed what we'd like to order.  My boyfriend had just suggested the smoked salmon crepe when the girl at the counter informed us that they weren't serving any of the savory crepes today.  However, the cook was preparing two ham/cheese crepes less than three feet from her as she said this.  We weren't happy; I have blood sugar issues and cannot eat a sweet crepe on its own without becoming ill.  However, we figured that we'd just get something there and grab something else soon afterward to keep my blood sugar levels steady.  We placed our order for two sweet crepes.

As we were paying, my boyfriend asked the counter girl why they weren't serving any savory crepes (mind you, she's saying this AT THE SAME TIME that the cook is folding the two savory crepes he was preparing and placing them on plates to be served to other patrons).  The girl responded that they stopped serving savory crepes at an hour before closing.  I looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while I checked my iPhone.  He told her that it was just 2:30pm.  He then asked if they should be serving the savory crepes until 3pm.

The counter girl changed her tune and said that the reason why they stopped serving them at that time was that they were running out of ingredients for the side dishes for the savory crepes; specifically, she told us that they had run out of the vegetables for the side salads.  Right behind her was a large Tupperware container filled with the salad greens and several prepared single-serving containers of the dressing, but I let it go.  I assumed that other patrons must've already ordered the savory crepes and therefore, the salad in the container was already spoken for.

We were wrapping up our meal at about 3pm when the counter girl sat down at the empty table next to us for her lunch.  She had a plate piled high with salad and mandarin oranges and despite the amount on her plate, there was still not enough there to account for all of the salad that had been in the Tupperware container.  The other patrons that I imagined had ordered the savory crepes before us did not exist either.  We were left to assume that they simply were not interested in serving us savory crepes.  

I would not have had a problem had the counter girl not lied to us.  Adhering to restaurant policy is one thing but outright lying to us is quite another.  I am a reasonable person and my boyfriend is one of the most easy-going and accepting folks I know; we're fine if you have to limit the menu due to lack of ingredients or time.  But to blatantly lie to us?  Guess what, Crepes Parisiennes...I don't find that to be acceptable.  You can say 'au revoir' to my patronage as I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"I was going to eat there. While I was choosing what to order, and after my wife had sat at the table, we were asked to leave the table for someone else.
Meanwhile there were plenty of people sitting at their tables talking over empty plates. They have double standards. 
We left the place and are not thinking of going there anytime soon."}
{"text":"A very unique breakfast place with great crepes (and tons of different kinds), at really decent prices.  It vaguely reminds me of Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, in that it's just crepes and a drink...there's nothing else on the menu (at the Cafe Du Monde, it's beignets and a drink).  

Here are some other things I like about this place:

- No disgraceful uniforms for employees, or anything resembling a uniform
- No over-the-top \"Frenchness\" (it's Pittsburgh for Christsake)...with the obvious exception of a 3-4 foot Eiffel Tower
- you can watch them cook the crepes while you wait, which is both entertaining and you can see how fresh everything is
- the crepes are delicious, and cooked quickly and perfectly, with different oil/sauce choices 

What I didn't like was:
- the regular coffee isn't brewed fresh (less than 30 minutes), I think because the staff was too busy.  Any serious coffee drinkers will know the results.
- Its small, and can only hold 30 people according to the government.  You order first, then take your seat, which means you wait at the counter until someone gets up and leaves.  As a result, the staff does this thing where they pretend not to see you until a table opens up.  I understand, I do, but some courtesy, even phony courtesy, would be nice.
- Its not unlike eating breakfast in someones basement.

Still, those crepes are really damn good.  I'll go back soon."}
{"text":"There are two locations, one just off Walnut Street in Shadyside and one on Craig Street in north Oakland.  The hours are quite limited, but I like the French neighborhood cafe vibe. 
The crepes and coffee are really good, and they have a great selection of French tea.  The place is quite hectic, however.  As everyone said, wait in line to order, then get a table.  I have been in both locations many times, and it has never been a problem, though it does seem a bit weird at first. 
 As for the service, it seems that their attitude is to give any rudeness you give them right back.  Be polite, and they will treat you accordingly."}
{"text":"This is a good French style breakfast and lunch joint. The line is long on weekends but it's worth it. They have sweet and savory crepes, waffles, pastries, tea, coffee, espresso, and beer and cider. Kronenbourg 1664 is the Budweiser of France and La Fin Du Monde is French Canadian. I had the \"breakfast crepe\" with sausage, cheese and egg, with bechamel sauce and it was excellent.  I like the Paris feel of this place, the food is expertly prepared, the espresso is excellent and the service is great. Beware hordes of ignorant college drones on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"The crepes are almost pretty good, the coffee is pretty bad, and the people who work here actually go out of their way to be nasty. It has all the bad qualities of Paris with none of the good ones!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Food is so very delicious, staff is welcoming and the downstairs setting reminds me of an intimate ski lodge (if that's possible). I love this place. Wish I could make it here more often. Wish they had maybe a few more drink offerings, but water would be sufficient for how good their crepes taste.

My only real complaint - reason for only 4 stars - is that they advertise one time for closing, but you find out once inside that they actually stop cooking 20-30 minutes beforehand. I've gotten there near their posted closing time before - so they were still physically open - but they wouldn't cook me any food because they had already begun cleaning the equipment. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. If you're going to post a closing time, you need to stay open and serving until that time. If you're going to stop serving earlier, just post an earlier time. Problem averted."}
{"text":"Neat little place. I was surprised that the crepes were grilled like a panini, but everything was tasty.  We started out with savory crepes, then went back for sweet ones.   You can't go wrong with crepes and Nutella!"}
{"text":"Crepes Parisiennes gives off a charming tiny European cafe feel, complete with winding railings and outside seating (one table - but still) and its interior decor. My favorite of their dishes is the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. All their savory crepes come with a salad, which has clementines and is topped with the most refreshing dressing I've ever had. It's a great place to have lunch or a coffee, but I wouldn't come here if you were in a rush. The service, in my experience, is nice but pretty slow. This, that they're cash only, and the fact that they close very early and stop serving savory crepes an hour before closing are the reasons that I don't come here as often as I might and why it loses a star for me."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot over the years but just finally got around to reviewing the place. In fact, I've been a customer long before they opened this brick and mortar store, I used to get crepes from the cart they used to operate on CMU's campus on the corner of Margaret Morrison and Tech streets. 

I don't eat a lot of sweets so I unfortunately can't comment on their sweet offerings, but the savory crepes are awesome. I've had about every possible combination of savory ingredients and sauces by this point and I've never had a bad crepe. My absolute favorite is the ham and cheese with mushrooms and bechamel sauce. Perfect.

I've also had a panini once, wasn't at all impressed with it. Never tried another because, well, the crepes are too good to risk a visit on another panini. :)

Despite being surrounded by dedicated coffee houses, this is the best place to get a cup of coffee for at least a 4 block radius of Craig St between 5th and Forbes. I've never gotten a coffee drink, just plain old house coffee, and it's always been good. They also have a great selection of specialty teas and strangely enough hard ciders.

Some of their pricing is a little on the high side but food quality and good service will help lessen that sting. 

You could experience a lengthy wait if you go during peak lunch/dinner times. They only have so many cooking surfaces and each crepe is cooked with love and care so be patient or plan your visit accordingly. 

All in all, if you are in the area, this a place well worth visiting.

Also worth mentioning, they DO accept cards now. They are no longer a cash only establishment so don't let the older reviews sway your choice."}
{"text":"HOURS: 
   T-F: 9-5
   S-Su: 10-4

Thought it'd be smartest to first post the hours because they are a bit unconventional. They've eluded me a few times when I first heard about the place, somehow always at the times when I was most craving their crepes!!"}
{"text":"For every crepe place I've been to, I've always ordered the same thing: Nutella with strawberries. The problem was, the only solid strawberries they had were mixed with other berries, which upset me. Because I'm a fairly picky eater, i got a simple Nutella crepe. It was perfectly fine, and i borrowed a few strawberries from my friend, although the stipulations on the menu, once again, were a nuisance. Oh, and what is this... \"Cash only\" thing? I'm sure this loses them half of their potential Pitt student customers Otherwise, it was a delicious dessert that you can't go wrong with at all."}
{"text":"Had brunch last Saturday there. The crepes are delicious. While there seemed some issue arranging the seats. We were asked to change seat twice."}
{"text":"French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said, I found the crepes to be overly thick and the filling, while tasty, too skimpy and thus overpowered by the crepes wrap. But it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment. I was in Pittsburgh visiting a relative with terminal cancer at the nearby hospital ; she had requested a breakfast crepes so I found Cafe Parisiennes through Yelp. We were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours. The sign said the Cafe opened at 10:00AM, which was when we arrived. We could see staff inside and asked if we could come in. The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready \"in ten minutes\" or so. After another ten minutes, we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order, I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange. This is not the kind of attitude for anyone in a service business and I would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!"}
{"text":"I have tried various crepes on the menu and have never come across anything that I don't like! The breakfast crepe and smoked salmon crepe are my two favorite savory crepes and my boyfriend and I always split a banana and nutella for dessert! It is a little pricey, but worth it. And luckily if you forgot to bring cash there are 3 or 4 major banks close by! I just wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"The best crepes I've ever had. I have tried to find something that compares, but I can't and I don't know if I will. It can get pretty busy in here and often there can be a line, but it is worth the wait.

Just as a note: When you go in, you should order first and then find a table. It often can be busy enough that all the tables are full at the moment you walk in. You should wait your turn and order at the counter. Once you have placed your order, take a seat. They will probably not let you order until an open table has popped up. Thus, if it is busy, don't be a jerk (whether you meant it or not) by grabbing a table as soon as you see it open up if you are waiting in line.

Also, if I remember correctly, it is cash only."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. But the fact that they don't take credit cards and that coffee refills are not free will keep me from going to this place very often."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the most legit crepes and hot chocolate I've ever had. I normally get the salmon crepe or the breakfast crepe if I'm feeling extra hungry. The hot chocolate is amazing in the winter. The only thing I don't like is that you can only take a seat after ordering, so it's easy for the inside to become crowded very often. The food itself and the service is superb though."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad a few weeks ago. The interior is decorated with a Parisian theme; very cute and cozy. There is very little seating, but we were able to grab a table. You can also see into the kitchen.

I ordered a hot chocolate which was the best part of my breakfast. It was thick and creamy and not sweet at all--pure chocolatey goodness. I also got a Black Forest Crêpe, which was filled with dark chocolate and topped with raspberry preserves. All their sweet crêpes are topped with fresh whipped cream and walnuts as well. The cream really does taste much better. The crêpe was good as well, though very rich.

My dad ordered a spinach and cheese crêpe, which was also good. All savory crêpes come with a salad.

This place was delicious, but a bit on the pricey side. I'll probably only return on special occasions."}
{"text":"Cash only. It's a bit pricey for crepes, but it's great to have the restaurant to fulfill crepe cravings :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It will not be our last! The ham and cheese crepe and dark chocolate crepe were authentically made and delicious!!  The iced mocha Parisiennes was amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really delicious crepes! I come here all the time and I love it.  The woman behind the counter always remembers my usual order.

Things to know before going: Cash only, order before sitting, and come during odd hours if you can.  It's a very busy establishment in a small location, but I normally go for late lunch on weekdays and have no problem at all getting a table right away or my food coming out quickly. I avoid Saturday mornings here."}
{"text":"We went for brunch at around 11:30 on a Saturday morning. There's a large menu up on the wall. You order at a counter, they bring the food out to your table. We ordered a turkey-avocado-tomato-cheese panini to share, then a nutella banana crepe for me, and a nutella crepe with berries for my husband. We also ordered a french hot chocolate each. The girl at the counter offered to bring out the panini first and the crepes later if we wanted, and so that's what we did. We got our hot chocolate first. It was rich and thick, but a little too bitter for my taste. My husband really enjoyed it, though. We were then brought the panini, which came with a side salad and some sort of vinaigrette dressing. The bread was thick and crusty, cheese perfectly melted, good portions of meat, and perfectly grilled. Around 10 mins after we finished our panini, the waitress brought us our crepes . Each one was filled with so much warm and melty nutella! Yummmm! They also came topped with walnuts and whipped cream. The crepes were thinner than those I had eaten at chain breakfast places. They were so good, we both wiped our plates clean. There's so many varieties to still try!
The waitstaff was attentive and friendly, even though it was so crowded,  and there was a perpetual line at the counter from the time we came in to the time we left. We never felt rushed the entire time. As others have said, cash only, but there's an atm right next door."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty awesome - simple, elegant (yep I think so) and with great flavor. The sweet crepes are really good, but I usually go there for brunch and although I can have a dessert for a meal, I know I shouldn't and I try to stop myself from doing so. Here at crepes, the savory crepes are so good that, the resistance isn't too difficult. 
If you are in a protein mood, the breakfast crepe (with sausage, egg and cheese) or the icelandic salmon crepe is a good idea. They are stuffed with the filling, so if you are a petite woman like me, the size is good enough for brunch or lunch. 
The chocolate-rasperry-whipped cream sweet crepes are out of this world, both white and dark chocolate. Oh, if you like coffee, their cafe au lait is AWESOME! The chocolat chaud (I learned to pronounce chaud today... I took Spanish in school, hello!) is great too. I am not huge on just chocolate, I need something else going on with it, but I like this chaud concoction. 
The service is pretty solid. I know it can get annoying waiting for a table, but I don't think the servers or management can do much about it. 
If the weather is bad, usually a good day to visit the Shadyside Crepes. Chances are you won't have a wait."}
{"text":"This place has delicious, delicious food.  I love eating it so much.  

On the down side, it's really kind of a pain to get in there.  The lines are long, and the seating is not plentiful.  That's after you fight for parking.  

As tasty as the crepes are, I usually decide it isn't worth the bother and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy stopping by the walnut location every week or so.  The French Breakfast tea with a savory crepe and salad is a great way to start a weekend.  While there's a huge list of crepes made-to-order, they're also willing to make you anything you can think of, as long as they have the ingredients.  Plus, it's underground, which just completes the aesthetic of a french crepe shop, where you sit amongst the sacks of flour to eat your crepe."}
{"text":"I've started a sort of tradition where every time I want something sweet i go to Crepes Parisiennes, however I've always gone to the one off Walnut street, which I've rated four stars for it's great crepes, awesome ambiance, and great teas.  However, this location has excellent crepes, standard ambiance, and great teas.  The chef here makes a better crepe. Whether the air is drier or her grill is hotter, I'm not sure, but her crepes are crisp on the outside and not overcooked on the inside.  Not that the over location doesn't have the same qualities, but these were better. I get a butter and sugar crepe almost every time I go and when done right, which it almost always is, I go sleep dreaming about it.

I'd also like to take a moment and say for the sake of both locations that I appreciate their commitment to rules and standards. There's a sign on the door that says \"place your order before taking a seat.\"  I go quite frequently and it is still quite rare that I do not see someone attempt to break this rule and take a seat from someone in line. I appreciate the chefs, who I presume are the owners, diligence when it comes to removing these people from the seats they would have taken from people who follow the rules of a fairly standard polite society. Yes, sometimes those people get angry and leave in disgust that anyone would touch their things or ask them to be civil; but, I am here to confirm the suspicion that the people who frequent your restaurant appreciate your actions and return because of it. So thanks.

Oh, and CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Absolute best crepes in the burgh! New liege waffles are excellent also. Service is top notch and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch every so often.  Its never packed to the max.  Just enough seats for everyone. It seems to have this weird balance of people coming in and out.  The first time I came here, I got a spinach, ham, and cheese crepe for my lunch and a nutella crepe for dessert.  It was good, but just a crepe.  My friend got the smoked salmon crepe with creme fraiche.  She said she doesn't usually like fish, but this was the only place she made an exception.  So with that compliment, I had to try the salmon on my next visit.  She was right.  It was wonderful.  I also found my sweet spot (pun intended) with the dessert crepe I like best.  White chocolate and banana!  Yum!  I'm not usually a person that orders the same thing every time I go somewhere.  But here.....I have my set list.  Play on."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for a light lunch/brunch. We usually order one savory crepe each (salmon, mushroom, cheese) and share a sweet one for dessert. And they have French cider! Perfect to accompany the crepes! I just wish the prices were a bit cheaper so we could visit more often."}
{"text":"My favourite place to relax and read a book, enjoy delicious waffle and crepe! Very friendly service and amaizing atmosphere!! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here for breakfast and the place was empty (probably since it was a weekday). Ordered the banana French toast crepe and the mushroom and cheese crepe. Servings were just nice. We didn't leave the place feeling too stuffed. 

My sweet crepe came with walnuts and fresh whipped cream which complimented my crepe perfectly and the entire combination wasn't too sweet. The savory crepe wasn't too cheesy and it came with a side of salad with a house dressing (red wine vinaggeraite). My friend opted out of the house dressing so they gave a side of olive oil instead. 

Remember, cash only."}
{"text":"These crepes are not crap.

I tried the banana chocolate crepe and it was perfectly warm and delicious. I don't usually like fruit in my crepes (I like them strictly filled with sugars devoid of any redeeming qualities), but the combination they served up was just right!

There's a lot of space, so you can chill with your homies for a while, which is nice.

Also tried the croissants: not bad, but I would more likely go back from crepes as the name suggests."}
{"text":"This place is great! The savory and sweet crepes are so good, it's worth the wait.  The side salad is also amazing. Service is okay but I'm not expecting a restaurant experience, just a place that serves excellent crepes and a seat to eat them at, which is exactly what I get.

I recommend any of the crepes."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite crepe place. They are in Oakland now and used to be by walnut street in Shadyside. The owner is so nice and he is usually behind the counter making the crepes. I usually get the savory crepes because I'm they're so tasty- I have tried them all and they all are amazing. This is really one of my favorite places- the coffee is delicious, the atmosphere is calm and relaxing. You must have cash and pay at the counter before seating. Love love love it here :-)"}
{"text":"I probably go here once a week. It's such a calm place  to sit down at and munch on a crepe, sweet or savory. They play french coffeehouse music and their espresso hits the spot. Highly recommend you check it out. Lots of little two person tables so not a good place to bring larger groups of more than four people."}
{"text":"First, they now take credit cards! Hurray! 

Second, crepes are solid. Pretty authentic and very yummy. I've had the salmon and the ham--both delicious. 

Third, TRY THE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. You wouldn't think that would be the highlight of a crepe place but holy crap. They are amazing. Do yourself a favor and try one."}
{"text":"The unassuming store front opens to a pleasant space making good use of unfinished brick opposed to simple white with a few French touches.   The menu stays very close to its core but with good variety on both the sweet and savory sides.   We enjoyed the salmon and mushroom versions and then shared a black forest for dessert. All were very pleasing. 

The staff was very attentive and when I got in line for our dessert intervened and told me to come to the counter.   A good policy as especially on a Saturday morning the crowd was substantial. 

So we recommend early arrival on the weekend and that you make the time for a visit."}
{"text":"We tried the sandwiches and crepes they been good but didn't exited us like the tiny shop we found on a road trip to Annapolis ...  also the opening times are not as great."}
{"text":"Servers were jerks and made me stand up from the table I grabbed because I didn't order immediately. Never will return again."}
{"text":"Went here this morning with my wife and 'kids' for Father's Day. It was reasonably busy but we got a table for four easily. 
Cash only is a negative, that should be changed. That however is the only negative. 
The service was excellent. The prices were reasonable for a mildly upper scale eatery. The food was very nicely presented and delicious.
Did the tourist thing and asked the server to take our picture since we are from out of town and nobody here will ever see is again - she nicely complied.
Excellent atmosphere, jazz playing at a perfect level to not interfere with conversation but loud enough to enjoy. 
Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My favorite crepe place! Another location on Craig Street. Yay!

They only take cash though and usually have strange hours. Plus it's packed at peak hours on weekends. 

Salmon dishes or anything with nutella is amazing. They also have Orangina!"}
{"text":"Boom! I love this place and I'm a 6'3\" man with an appetite! Every time people want to go I think great crepes and Ill be hungry right after I eat but damn I am wrong with this place.   Breakfast crepe is my choice but they all look amazing. This place fills up fast so get in line order and grab a table. EAT!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Not much else really to say. It wasn't bad, wasn't great. My experience was just EH."}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious. The place is rather small so getting a seat when it's busy is a little annoying. Not to take away from the food but it needs to be a bit bigger to accommodate slightly larger crowds."}
{"text":"Crepes Parisiennes does what it does very well.
The crepes are tender and buttery and the savory ones come with a side salad with mandarin oranges and a house vinaigrette. My favorites are the salmon or banana crepes. 

I can never tell when it's open though. Often I go, and they are closed for some inexplicable reason. Or they're super crowded..."}
{"text":"Eh, not as great as I expected. The latte was amazing! But the orange juice tasted like pulp free minute maid, not fresh squeezed. I'm not sure if they claim it to be fresh squeezed or not, but I expected it to be. I got the veggie crepe with bashamel sauce, which was really bland, I was hoping for more flavor. The sweet crepe with nutella and bananas was really good, but how can u go wrong with nutella! ;)"}
{"text":"Calm place, with good quality. However, it is a little pricey for the portions you receive. Not as filling as other crepe places in pgh"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy coming here between my afternoon and evening classes for a sandwich and coffee. Workers are friendly, music is easy, and food is good. Leave charmed."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise, negative stars would  be in effect. WHO on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to? What a completely miserable experience. The bitchy emo service obviously leaves something to be desired, then again so does the ENTIRE restaurant! Sure, melted cheese in a crepe is good. Know what else is good? ANY melted cheese from any breakfast place and Not having to endure this hell hole. I am just upset that I went there in the early part of my day and am now in a foul mood as a result. I have been in Pittsburgh a few weeks and this place is without rival the worst brunch I've ever had (PA or CA) So, the one positive thing about it IS.... it has made me appreciate every other sub par brunch I've had up until this point.  Absolutely will never return. EVEN THE Orange juice was bad. Are you kidding?"}
{"text":"Really delicious crepes! Both savory and sweet crepes are nice. My friends and I all enjoyed them a lot! They also have a great selection of tea! Yum!"}
{"text":"Not much space in here but really good crepes and the hot chocolate tastes like molten chocolate-- very rich and melts in your mouth. They also serve sandwiches."}
{"text":"The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. 

However, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink.

Finally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times. The space is small, and we passed up a visit one weekend day when the line was out the door thinking that there would be nowhere to sit when we got our order. Parking is street only, so you may have to cruise around a little. This establishment seems to attract lots of students from the area colleges. As you walk to the counter, the menu is on the wall to the left. You make your selections, place the order, and then grab a seat. The service has been quick on each visit, and the staff was always pleasant. The choices are for either savory or sweet crepes. We usually each order a savory, and then we share the sweet. That works out and leaves us satisfied. I ordered the Smoked Icelandic Salmon with creme fraiche, and tasted the Breakfast Crepe with the bechamel sauce that my daughter ordered. I would recommend either one. There are other sauce choices that we have never tried. The savory crepes come with a side of greens which I could easily pass up. We finished on our most recent visit with a simple apricot crepe, but we have tried some of the other combinations...all good. We usually just get the savory and sweet at the same time. They offer you the opportunity for delay on the sweet, and we should probably do that because the whipped cream is melting into the crepe by the time we get to it. This is a good place to visit anytime you are in the mood for a quick crepe."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Love the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe and the Nutella crepe. However, they are almost never open and the older gentleman (who I assume to be upper management) can be quite rude!

I have been there a few times and have no problem with the younger servers at all, who have actually been extremely pleasant and friendly. My biggest complaint is the manager/owner who literally hung up on me not but five minutes ago!! Had it not been for him, I would have given it 4 stars.

If you don't mind potentially rude service, I would recommend giving it a try. On the other hand, sometimes it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Crepes Parisiennes is nothing short of charming. The brick walls, French music, and sweet smell wafting through the small foyer is enough to make me want to buy a bus pass because the 2 hour parking on Craig Street simply isn't cutting it. 

I think my favorite thing on the menu has got to be their breakfast crepe with béchamel sauce. The crepes are light and delicious, and the béchamel sauce is rich and creamy. I'm pretty sure that if utopia had a national food, it would be this breakfast crepe. 

All of the savory crepes come with perfect little side salads, complete with house vinaigrette and little mandarin orange wedges. Couple that with a cafe au lait and I'm basically in heaven. Oh, and you ought to probably have a sweet crepe while you're there, as well. Why? Because Nutella, that's why.

If you're planning on going, be sure to bring cash and check their hours!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I miss this place so much!  I never knew what a treat a crepe restaurant was until I didn't have it anymore.  It's on a side street off of Walnut, in a small basement place with old stone walls. DON'T SIT DOWN BEFORE ORDERING! The owner will get mad.

I love the atmosphere, the mean owner, the cute waitresses, the big coffee mugs, and my favorites crepes are the 'savory', not 'sweet' ones.  I think my Perfect Day would begin here with an egg and sausage crepe with olive oil sauce.

It does get crowded. Go before 10 am or after 2 pm. Not open for dinner.  The newer crepe place on Craig street is nice too, more collegey. 

Man I miss this place."}
{"text":"The breakfast crepes with the soytang sauce are enough to drag me out of bed on the weekend that's how good they are.   And let's not even talk about all the sweet crepes full of chocolately goodness that you can order."}
{"text":"We've been here many times now, and the food is always good. Savory crepes, sweet crepes, waffles, danishes, etc - all are a treat. The tea here is also quite lovely.

Decent service, pleasant way to settle morning breakfast or afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Sold place to get crepes, I've only had one and it was pretty good. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I saw this place and went in on a whim for breakfast. The place looks a lot different on the inside than it does based on the outside. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the regular breakfast crepe plus an iced coffee and the total was about $11. The staff was pleasant, the service quick, and the food was delicious. I'm looking forward to stopping by again soon."}
{"text":"This place cemented my love for crepes. It tops of the list of crepe places across the states and even Paris for me. 
The perfect meal at this place is shared by 2. One savory and one sweet split by 2 people over a cup of coffee or orange juice. 
Savory crepes come with a fresh side of salad and mandarin orange. 
Sweet crepes come with fresh whipped cream and real fresh fruits, if you choose to get them. 
Crepes are light and delicious and will leave you feeling very satisfied.
The staff is courteous and the ambience of this place is great. Great chill trip hop music. People enjoying a good meal. It's perfect! 
I love everything about this place. My fondest memories of this place are with my best friend. We came here almost once a week by which point they knew how we liked to split our meal. 
They finally accept cards! For $10, this is a wonderful meal experience in Oakland!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out while in town for a weekend. Cute atmosphere while still casual but not the friendliest feel. Perhaps they feel that most of their customers are locals and generally know the protocol. I enjoyed the crepe which was berries and nutella and came fairly quickly. I got a good amount of Nutella but for that amount I feel that you need more berries to balance it out. Good overall and I would go back. I went shortly after it opened and there place started to really fill up as I was finishing up."}
{"text":"well worth the wait in line for tables to open up on a saturday morning.

not your standard fare, not greasy, not too much food, not expensive, french inspired yummmay-ness.

note: CASH ONLY my friends, unless something has changed in the last year."}
{"text":"Our second time eating there during our CMU visit. The place was packed, so we had to wait in line 20 or so minutes before we could order. We are sweet crepes lovers, and their variety keeps everyone satisfied. Most customers were eating savory crepes. Staff is super friendly, and I was able to order one to go for later for our family member we were missing at the time!"}
{"text":"Now I have lived a life with allergies for a long time. I'm extremely careful and ask if there are issues with tree nuts when ordering. I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and have made it clear that I have a tree nut allergy when ordering and no problem. Yesterday I did the same thing and, sadly, they almost killed me. i made it clear to the young man at the counter. I asked twice and we even laughed about it but I made it clear that I had allergy concerns. To no avail. I spent four hours in a hosptal ER. Never again folks. Never again."}
{"text":"hardly authentic, the food is decent, the staff are rude and completely lacking knowledge of what exactly a real crepe is.  Actually the chef as well."}
{"text":"Crepes are my new favorite breakfast/brunch item and Crepes Parisiennes did not disappoint. A lot of options to choose from and the service was quick and friendly. 

This is one of those places where you order, they give you a number, and they bring it out to you based on your order number so don't waste time; go straight to the counter and put in your order. My husband and I were both feeling a savory crepe so we each got the ham and cheese, but with different sauces. What I like about Crepes Parisiennes is that they give you your choice of sauce, which I haven't seen at too many other locations. They had four choices so I got the bechamel (traditional creamy sauce) and he got the creme fraiche (like a sour cream). The bechamel was rich and very comforting, yet not too incredibly rich. It was nice that a salad came with the savory crepes to add some fresh flavor. 

Crepes aren't the only thing on the menu. There was a variety of paninis, pastries, and other breakfast/brunch/lunch items. Their liege waffle looked absolutely amazing from what I could see on the plates of other diners there. 

Overall, there was nothing to complain about during my visit as the food was tasty and the service was great. I plan on revisiting to try a sweet crepe or waffle for sure!"}
{"text":"I'll give it one star because I have too. My daughter is a student at Pitt and works for an engineering firm near by. I happened to be close , as I was taking my husband to the cancer center so we decided to have brunch. I also took my daughters friend from NY along and both of them had eaten here before. Even though my daughter had vowed never return because apparently you can't sit down until you've received your food and they made her get up and wait. We went there because nobody else was serving breakfast. 

 I have never been verbally attacked by any food industry worker until today. I found out it was actually one of the owners.  I placed my order for 4 meals one to go 3 for restaurant. I asked for an extra outside chair which I did receive from a kind fellow and he carried it outside for me. After paying and receiving our beverages we headed out. My daughters coffee spilled out onto the table because the table was terribly wobbly. I ran into the restaurant and grabbed napkins from a container next to a serve yourself open container of water. Two employees literally chased me down ! One snatched the napkins and said \"those are ours , the sign says right there, don't take.\" I calmly explained I simply wanted to clean up my daughters coffee and there it started... The owner went on a rant about foodborne illnesses and how she wasn't making accusations that I had some disease ,but I shouldn't have touched the napkins and the sign is right there ..in other words I can't read and i'm an idiot. 

  My daughters friend that was our guest and in the food industry said,\"wow !\" All I can say to her is to maybe see someone for that anger problem or possibly live with cancer for a day . Hopefully she'll see that some things are better off left alone. 

Oh and the food was ok . The salad with a few canned mandarin oranges was blah and the crepe was a crepe . Not worth getting torn a new butthole and $40 for sure."}
{"text":"This is where we get his , hers  and our crepes along with chocolate croissants.A great place for a quick and elegant breakfast or brunch"}
{"text":"Came with a friend, waited for 20 min for a strawberry crepes, friend almost done eating, saw chef started cleaning up, I was afraid they forgot my order, so I went to the front and mentioned that I never got the crepes, and the chef replied \"Oh my god, and you survived!\", 3 min later the Chef brought the crepes and said \"I was just waiting for you guys to finish up\". My friend and I paid separately for our food, I don't know why it would seem like we were sharing, my food got delayed (or maybe even forgotten) and I got an attitude for pointing it out. That was rude and was bad business."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it. From sweet to savory, Crepes Parisiennes has what you want. I've hit them up for both breakfast and lunch and have left feeling like I've eaten an appropriate food for the time of day.

I love their breakfast crepe. They lightly fry the exterior giving it a nice, crispy outside and stuff it full of sausage, sharp cheese and egg. I've heard people complain about the authenticity of the side salad but, come on, who cares? The crepes are authentic enough, the salad is an afterthought and is still delicious, authentic or not.

Their sweet crepes are all balanced nicely. I've had their Gnutella crepe and their \"french toast style\" berry crepe. Both were delicious and came with a generous dollop of their homemade whipped cream.

As if their crepes weren't enough, they also do a killer cafe au lait. It's served in an authentic French fashion, in a handleless bowl and comes with a generous circle of white, velvety foam. The beverage is a little on the hot side, which is usually a no-no when it comes to good coffee, but I let it slide because they still pack it full of flavor.

This place gets packed on the weekends yet the service has always been impeccable. They even bring my dessert crepe out after my meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is absolutely delicious. The service is great too. Only downside is that it is cash only.-- this place takes credit cards now!"}
{"text":"The food is really really good.. they have a great selection of sweet and savory crepes
The place is cute.. really small.. and most tables are full whenever I get here.. 
But its really irritating that they don't accept credit cards.. I need to visit an ATM anytime I'm planning to dine at this place."}
{"text":"For the price, the crepes were ok! Not too salty and not too sweet, the crepes had a good balance of flavor. The sweet crepes seemed a bit basic, though, and some needed more textural contrasts. I would recommend the savory crepes, simply because they come with a side salad and also have some more flavor variety. You have to get your own water from the pay area, and the staff seem nice enough. You pick where you want to sit, and if you go when it's not too busy, it's a good, reasonably priced place to get a good crepe in a nice setting."}
{"text":"This place is my default for a casual weekend brunch because it's so conveniently placed on Craig St. It's a small, homey crepe place with a good selection of both sweet and savory, as well as espresso drinks and teas. My go-to is the breakfast crepe with bechamel sauce, an iced latte, and a nutella and berries crepe to share. My one caveat is that seating is always dicey - you order first and then wait for a table to open up; however, it can't be helped since this place is small and pretty popular."}
{"text":"I've been to Crepes Parisiennes twice now (Filbert St location). I had a fantastic meal there this morning.

The biggest problems about the place are that it's cash only and it's quite small inside. I agree with others -- the seating system is pretty odd.  We had no wait getting a table for two this morning though. It's probably best to go in smaller groups. A larger group was ahead of us, and I think they were still waiting for a table even after we got our food (btw, we got our food VERY quickly).

I HIGHLY recommend the savory crepes. They're simply fantastic -- very flavorful and just the right consistency. The salad and dressing that accompany the crepe are very tasty as well. I've also tried the sweet crepes -- they're also good, but for me, they don't compare to the savory ones.

Bottom line for me: I prefer to go here with only one other person, and I plan to order a savory crepe every time I go back (with cash in-hand)!"}
{"text":"Abandon all credit cards, ye who enter here - this is a cash-only establishment. 

Savory: The savory crepes are good, but not great. For starters, they are not nearly as filling as similarly priced crepes I have had in the past. If you go on an empty stomach, I highly suggest ordering a panini instead. The most impressive savory crepe on the menu is the smoked salmon. I was hoping for a more inspired menu, but the options are pretty run-of-the-mill. 

Sweet: I suggest veering away from the savory and opting for a sweet crepe instead. They're ideal for a light dessert. If you're like me and have a constant hankering for Nutella, this is a quick, easy way to satiate your sweet tooth. Pair it with some chocolat chaud and you've struck the formula for sugar-induced bliss. 

The ambience is...unexpected. The decor suggests intimate french cafe, but this is undermined by a soundtrack of top 40's hits. Pro tip: bring along a friend, drown out the music in conversation, and you can pretend for a few minutes that you're sipping lattes in France."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often, and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we're there.

The crepes are excellent, the prices are more than reasonable, and as long as you don't go there during a peak period, it's never too crowded."}
{"text":"First I need to start off by saying that I have been wanting to go here for months and I was worried that I anticipated it too much and I wouldn't be as happy. No, I was completely satisfied! I loved everything from the coffee and crepes down to the music they were playing. 

The only thing that was slightly annoying was the fact that they don't accept cards, just cash. That was easily resolved since there is an atm right next door. It very easy to order, everything is right there in front of you on a big menu board. The waitress was very helpful as well. We ordered our food and sat down. They bring you everything when it's done.

The room itself is very relaxing and is a place I could just sit and read all day (while eating crepes of course). I had gotten nutella and banana crepes. Can I just say that nutella is just amazing and I'm pretty sure it's just melted gold! So obviously it was delicious. I was pretty happy with the crepe size as well. I was expecting just two small crepes that had been rolled up. No, they give you this big crepe that's been folded over a couple times. My boyfriend's savory crepe came with a salad. His was also delicious, but of course mine was better.. nutella, duh. Oh and the coffee was great as well, I got the espresso and hot chocolate drink. Why is this the first time I've seen this? Though I think the espresso is still in my system after three days.

Also the kitchen is an open kitchen and it was amazingly clean! I mean you would hope all restaurants you go to have clean kitchens, but that's not how it always is. I mean I felt like that was just a show kitchen and all the cooking was actually done in the back! 

We are actually going back again this week! I mean we have to try everything on the menu, that's the only fair way to judge a place! Maybe I should find a gym near by..."}
{"text":"Very nice place for lunch.  Crepes are good, although not outstanding.  The side salads are marvelous.  I liked the vibe - definitely places an emphasis on quality.  It's a small place so you might not get seating if you are a large group."}
{"text":"I've walked past here many times & finally decided to try it. My Nutella banana crepe was delicious! I'll have to come here again!"}
{"text":"CP is a pretty chill spot in Shadyside.  It's located on a side street off Walnut.  The main business is in a basement which is sorta dark, kinda  cool.  You can see the chefs making the food in front of you.  Pretty neat overall.  

Crepes galore.  We had the nutella with chocolate and the veggie crepe with eggs.  Both items were fantastic.  Since we weren't quite feeling the darky basementy vibe on an otherwise gorgeous spring day, we sat outside the restaurant on one of their tables, which was definitely a nice touch to the restaurant.  The service for the most part was good: I was kind of annoyed by how slow it takes to order and cook these dishes.  I noticed that there are only 2 stations to make the crepes.  They'd certainly benefit from an expansion.  Lines get long, wait time can be significant (prob had a 30-40 min lag from when we stepped into the building to when we finally got served), but it's worth it if you have the time.

Cash only.  I'll probably be back.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast/lunch. The crepes are great and the coffee is just what you expect in an independent coffee house (excellent)! 

Each time I visit Pittsburgh I have to eat there at least once, I try to hit it twice.  Not only is the food great (not fried and fresh fruit is used when available) the atmosphere is very fun for all ages.

Be sure to take a pocket full of quarters though, Pittsburgh has cash only parking meters. The meters on Craig St. are 1 hour max but, a quarter does buy you half an hour."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/lunch. The crepes are great and the coffee is what you expect at an independent coffee house (excellent)!

When in town I eat there at least once but, try to hit it twice. The atmosphere is great (good for all ages-- small children- business lunch- or to catch up with friends). 

Don't forget to take quarters for street parking. Pittsburgh has cash only parking meters. The meters on Craig St. have 1 hour max but, $0.25 does buy you half an hour."}
{"text":"The crepes are worth the visit! Especially the salmon and black forest crepes. Lunch is quite crowded so I would suggest visiting in the early afternoon after the lunch rush. I have mixed feelings about the service. Typically the person behind the register is friendly and helpful. But the food prep workers and servers seem to always be agitated. The restaurant is quite small and I think it is slightly over-priced."}
{"text":"The savory crepes are five stars but the wait impacts the experience. If you go during lunch time be prepared to wait a good twenty minutes for your crepe, but you can also be prepared for it to be totally worth it! I will definitely be returning to try sweet, I saw a couple people double down right away but it seemed out of my price range for that. I got the standard meat egg and cheese crepe and the crepe was so perfectly crispy it was almost like a breakfast quesadilla. I'm not particularly a fan of crepes in general but this place sold me, so if that's you give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Had the breakfast crepe and house coffee, no complaints...only regret is I wish I had enough room to eat a sweet crepe also...."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch and desert crepes in a fun atmosphere. Super tasty, but a bit pricey, and the place is usually quite crowded. As long as you're not in a hurry, this place is great! Try a cappuccino with your lunch!"}
{"text":"The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, \"might be\" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.

Please let me explain.

The restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  

First, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.

It's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.

The dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!

What's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  

After waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, \"enough of this nonsense\".

My party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm no crepe connoisseur, but I did try quite a few places. I waited Yelping this place until I got a chance to try San Francisco's well-known crepe place. Whereas the SF place wins on their ambiance category, this Pittsburgh gem has a way better quality crepe. The taste here is by far more superior than any other places.  Be prepared to wait in line for half an hour+ on a weekend, but I can assure you that your patience will be well rewarded with a great plate of crepe - regardless of what kind you order!

P.S. - BRING CASH. They do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"After walking by this place what felt like a million times, I was so excited to get to try this place.  I knew the weird quirks (long lines, no sitting until you have ordered, cash only, etc.) and yet was so excited to get in and try the food.  Unfortunately, however, despite the hype, the crepes just weren't great.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but just good.  The plates and silverware were plastic, the servers were rude, and there was no such thing as atmosphere.  I could be convinced to go back and give it another try if a friend wanted to check it out, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.... it wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I love this little crepe shop. Friendly service and absolutely delicious food. I've had their crepes a few times and am always pleased with them, but decided to try their pesto, mozzarella and tomato panini during my most recent trip. I was blown away by the generous portion and the delicious flavors and freshness that was bursting out of this sandwich. Just perfect. Their side salads with the vinaigrette are always delicious and the perfect accompaniment to a tasty crepe or panini. Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???"}
{"text":"Solid crepes for the morning! This was the first place I ate in Pittsburgh, and I was pleasantly surprised at how authentic it tasted. I came here with a friend upon opening, and there was already a line forming within 5 minutes. 

I ordered the Breakfast Crepe, which came with sausage, egg, and cheese. I didn't care too much for the side salad, but the crepe itself was so fresh and delicious. The Soytang sauce was an awesome complement to the crepe itself! 

I only wish that the crepes could be more customizable - like a DIY crepe where you can add a certain number of ingredients. I would've loved to add mushrooms or spinach to the breakfast crepe! Otherwise, solid breakfast place :)"}
{"text":"The salad with the champagne dressing was very good and light.  I ordered the salmon crepes with spinach and was very nice with the creme fraiche.  Other items ordered was the spinach and cheese (tasted more like quiche), ham and cheese (what could go wrong?), and the dark chocolate crepe (62% cocoa).  They didn't give enough whip cream and walnuts on the sweet crepe but did satisfy the sweet tooth in the end.  Good enough!"}
{"text":"These are the best and most authentic crepes in Pittsburgh!!! If I could go here every week I would. Their breakfast crepe with bechamel sauce is my favorite paired with a cider or a mocha parisienne (depending on the time of day). Their crepes are served with a small spring leaf salad, which is quite common in France. 

This location is owned by a husband and wife who spent a large amount of time in France. Their hours are slightly disappointing, but I can't blame them considering it's just the two of them running the place. The one tip I have is that the seating here is limited. They cannot easily accommodate large groups, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and had their breakfast crepe with egg cheese and sausage. It was great!!!. Good sized portion and tasted really fresh. Also the price is good for what you get. I can't wait to go back and get a sweet crepe!"}
{"text":"Highlights: great food, quick service, and plenty of authentic French food choices (esp the hot chocolate!).

There was no wait for a party of three at 2pm on a Sunday, but I would imagine it can get pretty crowded as the restaurant is pretty small -- seats around 20-30 people. FYI this place takes credit card now (apparently it wasn't a couple years before).

I was pretty hungry and the crepes seemed on the smaller size for the price, so my brother and I got the ham and cheese panini and turkey tomato and avocado panini. Portions were very filling--sandwiches come with a basic salad with a housemade champagne vinaigrette that was simple but refreshing. The ham and cheese panini was really good but the turkey was just mediocre. What stood out were the drinks! If you have never had European/South American hot chocolate, I would definitely recommend trying it out as you will never want to drink powdered Nesquik again (my childhood favorite rip). French style hot chocolate typically uses whole milk and bittersweet chocolate so definitely be prepared to expect it to be very rich. Coffee was also pretty good. Overall, I would definitely come back here again to try the crepes."}
{"text":"In love with the ambiance of this place! Such a cute little cafe. Good crepes and DELICIOUS hot chocolate! I come here all the time in the winter."}
{"text":"My 5 stars are only for the SAVORY CREPES. I've never had savory crepes before this. Ever since trying Crepes Parisiennes, I've tried savory crepes at various places because I'm always hoping I can find a crepe place just as good as this place wherever I'm at, but they never live up to my expectations. Why? Because the savory crepes at Crepes Parisiennes are the best, hands down. 

My favorite is the ham and spinach with bechamel sauce. The bechamel sauce is freaking bomb. It's not only the ingredients they use, but the way they fry their crepes that make it oh-so-tasty. The crepe itself is very thin and fried to a light golden brown color with a hint of sweetness. I'm a damn slow eater, but i can devour this thing in 5 minutes. I've also tried their ham and cheese as well as salmon, both are pretty good. All the savory crepes come with a small portion of green salad with a lightly flavored vinaigrette sauce - tastes good. I'm not a fan of sweet crepes so I've never had any of them, but they are cheaper than the savory ones. 

I've also had their house coffee, french latte, and hot chocolate with steamed milk. They were all whatever. House coffee is probably the best bang for your bucks but can sometimes be sour. French latte was too dark and bitter for my liking, and the hot chocolate left a nasty after taste. I had to gargle my mouth with water a few times afterwards. 

When i think of savory crepes, i think of this place and this place only. 

Warning: Place is cash only which is a downside, but I'd make a trip to the ATM any day for this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  Whether you are visiting or live in Pittsburgh, you MUST check this place out.  Like others said, CASH ONLY, so be sure to bring some.  Their crepes are out of this world.  Their sweet crepes are very rich, so my best advice is to get both a sweet and a savory crepe and split with a friend.  My fave sweet crepe is the Black Forest and my fave savory crepe is the egg and sausage...SO good!  I can't speak to the coffee...but if you really need to get your coffee fix, go to Starbucks a block down!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, either sweet or savory. I have had both and both were excellent! The ham and cheese came with slim sliced delicate ham with bechamel sauce, accompanied by mixed green salad with vinaigrette. A lovely light meal. French tea is very tasty.  French breakfast tea has a floral quality. Lovely."}
{"text":"Crepes Parisiennes in Shadyside is absolutely scrumptious and many people agree because this place and the Craig Street (Oakland) location are always busy.  It's the perfect place for a light brunch or lunch with a couple people (whoever since it's casual... friends, family, potential significant other, etc.), but not so much for large groups since seating is extremely limited and you have to place your order first (and wait for an available table if there aren't any).  If you do have to wait, you can spend some of that time looking right into the small kitchen area and watch as your crepe is made.  My favorite is their [savory] salmon crepe.  Mmm mmm mmm!!  The sweet crepes are too big for me to eat alone so if there's a group consensus, we'll order one and split it.  (Oh, Nutella!)  Random, but I'll also add that I like how I can pour my ice water from their pitcher rather than get it from a little tab under the lemonade spout thing on a fountain drink machine."}
{"text":"Went toCraig St. location, had Veggie-Salmon my wife had Mushroom-Spinach Crepe... 

For those who relate to food as savory and gourmand experience, DON'T GO THERE. The crepes were just bland and uninteresting compilation of ok-fine ingredients, you can mix those at home yourself  at a quarter of the price, without need to knowing much about French cuisine. 
For college kids it could be a step up from fast and rush pizza and fast-food places, but that's about it.

Teas were good - at least something French and tasty!"}
{"text":"Food - mediocre.

If you still get enticed by sort of cute look of the cafe and decide to enjoy seating outside (on their one and only table)  -  getting anything beyond and above a simple cup of coffee or a tea is just not worthy money and time spent

Even in Pittsburgh (which can't really boast to have more than singular option for pretty much any type of fine food) you can do better than this..."}
{"text":"There is not much to say about this place.  The crepes are wonderful.  The savory crepes are generally accompanied by a salad of sorts.  The quality is great, certainly comparable to anything else I have had in the United States, and pretty close to what I have had in Paris.  One limitation, I did go to a place in Key West of all places that used some sort of Buckwheat or whole wheat batter for their savory crepes that was really really great.  It would be great if Crepes Parisiennes could adapt that.  My only other issue is that the place is a tad pricey."}
{"text":"The crepes here are really lovely - well-portioned - and come with a classic side salad. The ambience here is unique - it feels like a well-furnished, cozy cave, rather than sitting in a Starbucks (which unfortunately is what the Craig Street location feels like!) It's very popular, but classy enough to bring a Sunday brunch date to. 

I used to come here EVERY single weekend my freshman year of college. I'm several years out of college but come back here fondly whenever I visit Pittsburgh. It's been almost ten years since I started going to this restaurant, and amazingly, the prices have only risen by a quarter (as in, 25 cents, not 25 percent) or so since I was a wee college freshman. Inexpensive with wonderful service - I only wish they had a place like this in Philadelphia!"}
{"text":"Crepes are good nothing really special. The place is cozy and the people are nice. Their service is not fast though!"}
{"text":"I finally tested out Crepes Parisiennes on Wednesday around 4:00, and it was quite an enjoyable mid-afternoon dessert.

So unfortunately, I was hoping to do a savory crepe for an early dinner, but they stop serving savory crepes after lunchtime, which is a total bummer.  I decided to go with a dessert one and got the banana and chocolate crepe ($6.84), and it came with homemade whipped cream!  They also offered to put walnuts on the crepe, but I don't care for walnuts.  That homemade whipped cream was delicious and light and perfect.  The actual crepe was fairly standard and expected.  The price point felt high, but I have paid double this for a crepe in other cities so I probably shouldn't complain.

The staff was nice but already mostly cleaned up to close. Don't push it too much and try walking in her close to closing because I doubt they would serve you.  They brought a water and my crepe to the table, which was really nice.

The atmosphere is cute and peaceful, and they do not have wifi, which is the best.  I am so sick of wifi hogs taking over anywhere they can because they \"can't work/study at home.\"  It's called self-discipline, people.  Get some.  I loved just sitting here peacefully.

Overall, this is a nice plate to sit and treat yourself.  Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Decent food, though I was not blown away. I had the mushroom and cheese crepe, it was good, but a bit oily, and the feta, walnut and orange salad, with a garlic olive oil dressing, and it was bit bland. Overall OK for the price. The outdoor table was really nice. Annoying that they only take cash."}
{"text":"Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \"help wanted\" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe."}
{"text":"Love this place! Use the salad dressing- it's light and perfect. I usually do the mushroom savory crepe and the banana and Nutella or chocolate sweet crepe. It's small, so hard to visit with a large group, but quick and delicious if you're by yourself or in a small (4 or less) group. It's slightly pricey for a lunch, especially if you do one sweet and one savory like I do, but for the occasional lunch it's worth it for me. Love it!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town to the science museum,  loved finding this small family feel restaurant. Great tasting food, for \"really thin pancakes.\""}
{"text":"Customer Service Only: As a disclaimer, I did not stay to eat, so I cannot comment on the quality of the food. Anyone who knows what it is like to have a handicap parent, knows that for new places, we call ahead. Coming from the Shadyside community a few minutes away, we called in advance to ask about ingredients, time wait, and handicap accessibility. We were told there was no wait, room, and reviewed allergies.  They said they cannot save seats. I said that's okay. Be three in less than 5! Needless to say, when I arrived, there was very limited room. However, we found some tables for my handicap mother and 2 year old. I was approached by the waitress who said those seats were saved and we couldn't sit there. There were groups waiting for 20+ minutes.  I was shocked about the \"seat yourself\" \"no saving seats\" and the call ahead to find out. She said, \"well you didn't talk to me\".  Got baby bundles back up, & Packed up mom and left. Will never return to a place with such lack of communication and rude employees. Such a waste of time and effort. Well below standards. I will go continue to go to cafe moulin whose servers are knowledgeable and respectful. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The setting is nice and staff is pleasant, but the crepes and coffee are average at best. Ingredients were too simple and not very flavorful. It had the feel of a fast food crepe restaurant with a lack of attention to food quality.

The restaurant is also cash only which is inconvenient and likely deters business. You will get far better crepes at restaurants such as Cafe Moulin or Square Cafe."}
{"text":"Very good place for brunch :-) ordered a mushroom & cheese crepes. The house coffee is average. Well, I guess it's only for a light brunch, do not expect too much haha. Would recommend this!"}
{"text":"Yum! I always go to the one on Craig and it never disappoints! If im looking for something savory, the smoked salmon is the way to go. For dessert I get the white chocolate with banana- SO delicious.

The tart salad that comes with the savory crepes are light and fresh while the decadent sweet crepes are never a disappointment!

Make sure to bring cash as it's cash only!"}
{"text":"had a savory and a sweet crepes, a long with an awesome cider (Christian Drouin)
Great taste of crepes , just like back home in France :)"}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorite breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  The crepes are always cooked to perfection and the coffee is absolutely amazing.  Inconveniences include being cash only and being very, very tiny so getting a table might require some patience on a busy weekend morning...

...but it is totally worth the wait.  The sweet crepes are my favorite, but I'm just a sucker for anything that involves fruit and nutella."}
{"text":"Crepes are overpriced and disgusting.  It was like $9 for a crepe that was filled with nothing.  Service was non-existant."}
{"text":"I've been here once before, a while ago.  It's a cute place to have breakfast, lunch, or brunch during the weekend, specializing in crepes, as the name suggests.  I came for lunch on a Sat., and had a savory crepe with salmon, creme fraiche, and capers.  I recall it tasting fresh and delicious, though the specifics escape me since it's been awhile.  As a first-timer, I didn't have any problems with the service.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, which is bright, clean, and cozy.  I'd definitely like to come back to try a sweet crepe--if they were open during the evenings, I'd surely already have done this.  Their hours are 9am-5pm, which are a bit inconvenient during the week for those of us who work, esp. if we don't work nearby.  Cash only, but there's an ATM half a block away, on the corner of Craig and Fifth.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Wait, how have I not reviewed Crepes Parisiennes?

I first fell in love with crepes in my early teenage years, when a crepe shop opened up in my hometown of State College. Yes, the town that is best known for its love of football and binge drinking once had a restaurant that sold crepes that were practically transcendent, stuffed with anything you could imagine. Not surprisingly, it didn't last long, and my heart broke when it closed and I could only get my crepe fix on my yearly family vacations to Disney World.

In my sophomore year of college, I studied abroad in Italy, and rediscovered my crepe obsession when I found them in a British-style pub. A trip to Paris for four days had me eating the simple street version each day for breakfast. And then I returned to State College, crepeless and sad. How excited was I when I moved to Pittsburgh and found Crepes Parisiennes? I don't even think I need to answer that question.

These are GOOD crepes. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The topping list is unfortunately very limited. They don't have many veggies, they only have one type of cheese, and they don't have bacon for your breakfast crepe or strawberries for your dessert crepe. Still, you can't really go wrong with any of the combinations.

I came back to State College and tried the new crepe shop in town, and it sucked. It made me realize that I totally take Crepes Parisiennes for granted. The food might be simple, but trust me when I say Pittsburgh is lucky to have it!"}
{"text":"All the crepes are a little too simple for my tastes.  I ordered a savory and sweet crepe.  For savory, I ordered the salmon crepe which was supposed to be smoked salmon but did not appear to be so.  Many salmon omelettes I've had before included capers, tomatoes, onions, and cream cheese for a similar price.  The crepe itself was also crispy.  When I order a crepe I expect something a little lighter and softer, so sadly it did not meet my expectation.

Then I ordered the dark chocolate- raspberry crepe.  It has some funky name like Chocolate Forest Crepe, or something.  The dark chocolate filling was too bitter to be served.  It tasted like melted 80% dark chocolate which shouldn't be served without being something be added to it.  It was also topped with frozen strawberries that were still cold.  Not a pretty picture.

I would be surprised to learn that these were authentic french crepes.  It seemed more like the McDonalds of crepes.

They were also cash only which is ridiculously inconvenient."}
{"text":"If you want to start your day with good decisions go to this place. Had the Belgian Nutella waffle w/bananas and it was amazing! I've had waffles in Belgium and these tasted better. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"I am writing the same review for Cafe Moulin and Crepes Parisiennes.  To me, they both have excellent crepes and coffee. And I have happy to go into either of them any day. The only difference is where I am at the time, and how big a party I have. 

Crepes Parisiennes is on S Craig St. Street parking if you are driving and good luck finding a space on Craig. The shops have ~10 tables, and its customer base is Pitt + CMU + UPMC.  Small shop means it is likely packed.  Go in, line-up, order, find a table, and they bring the food to you when ready.  Definitely should try this out if you are a student nearby.

Cafe Moulin is in Shadyside, Walnut Street area, next to a parking lot. About ~25 tables I guess.  At least I never have to wait in the line.  Go in, they will find you a table, and the waiter will take your order and bring the food over.  If you are driving, or with a big party (6+), I would prefer Cafe Moulin.

Foodwise, cappuccino, Latte, chocolate strawberry crepe, smoked salmon crepe... I am going to say Cafe Moulin's smoked salmon crepe (Alaskan) has more salmon than Crepes Parisiennes... but it is also more expensive ($11 vs $10)... and it might be just that day.  So don't take my words for it."}
{"text":"The crepes here are AWESOME.  The place is pretty small so keep that in mind when going.  Also, you have to put in your order prior to sitting- some people try to do otherwise and save tables beforehand, which isn't allowed.

Both the savory and sweet crepes here are good.  I usually go with someone and we both get savory crepes and share a sweet one as 'dessert'.  The mushroom, spinach, and cheese crepe with the house sauce my go-to choice.  For sweet, nutella and banana is always a safe default.  Hard to go wrong with nutella and anything!

Oh, also note that they only take cash!"}
{"text":"Good walking distance from both CMU and UPitt.

Lots of choices for sweet crepes. They have varieties of chocolates like white, dark, Belgian, hazelnut nutella, etc. as well as your standard fruits like strawberries, bananas, etc.

I prefer their savory crepes over their sweet ones. You can choose from three different sauces: Bechamel, Creme Fraiche, and Garlic Olive Oil. They put the sauce on the side so the crepes don't get soggy. The savory crepes also come with a fresh salad with vinaigrette on the side.

Crepes themselves are soft and more pancake-like than crisp, but the fillings are delicious.

You would normally come here for crepes, but they have amazing paninis as well. Their turkey and avocado one is light but filling. Perfect for lunch. 

Only complaint is that they have the oddest hours. Stopped by many times to find that they are closed. Fortunately, Craig Street has many other lunch options. You can usually tell they're open when they put their sign out."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I've passed by so often but never tried -- until last week. My boyfriend and I decided to try it for an after-church brunch and were delighted with the result. Although this space is small and somewhat tight (perhaps a more charming term would be \"intimate\"), space is at a premium in Oakland and a full house usually means good food. This turned out to be the case. The menu is large enough to please everyone but not overwhelming, and we loved the balance of sweet and savory options. 

         We both opted for a savory crepe, and were rewarded with filling, comforting dishes, each of which included a side salads complete with a lovely house vinaigrette. But what stood out to me was the croissant and the espresso. I can never eat a regular croissant again without comparing it to the light, buttery goodness experienced here. The thick, rich but not-too-sweet mocha espresso was something to sit and enjoy slowly. 

         All in all, this is a lovely little place and the fact that it does not have internet is plus in my opinion, since the ambiance is great for conversation as long as it is not too crowded. Will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Kind of underwhelmed. Crepes are such a versatile food, and I've had some absolutely delicious crepe combinations before. The ones here were neither filling, nor unique, nor cheap to me. I felt like almost all of the savory crepes were ___ + cheese, with the exception of the salmon crepe. I ended up splitting that and a Belgian white chocolate crepe with bananas with a friend. They were just OK, and the sweet crepe was a bit more special in terms of flavor. Overall, I think there are better options for lunch or dessert around."}
{"text":"Crepes Parisiennes is a small creperie in Oakland with a wide selection of sweet crepes and a smaller selection of savory crepes made fresh in front of yo face. The lines get long and seating is limited. It is best to eat your crepes immediately so you'll want to try to dine in if you can. Unfortunately it's a small place. I stopped by for lunch here after checking out Carnegie Museum of Art and was only able to snag a table because I ate lunch at 3pm. It's a great place for lunch and/or dessert seeing as crepes aren't particularly \"heavy\" and the food comes out quickly. My smoked Icelandic salmon crepe was decent - while the salmon did not seem seasoned in the slightest, salmon has its own natural flavor that prevents it from being bland. The crepe itself was just ok and came with creme fraiche and a lemon wedge for much needed flavor. The side salad was basic and refreshing with the light, tarty dressing that was provided. I also got the cafe au lait and was rather disappointed in the presentation. Nowadays it is all about the latte art and to be honest, part of the reason why I ordered the cafe au lait was because I saw a photo of it on Yelp with a gorgeous leaf design. Mine came out looking like a deformed heart at best but at least the taste was average."}
{"text":"The Savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment. The service was suprisingly snooty considering this is low key place."}
{"text":"I must admit the crepes here are quite tasty, very reminiscent of ones I have had in France and I especially appreciate the fresh green salad that accompanies some.

That said, their seating system is quite confusing upon the first visit.  They won't take your order unless there is an open table.  Makes sense, unless there are clueless people in front of you who had half their party sit at the last open table... gridlock.

Anyhow, quite a lovely experience but I'm not sure it was enough to lure me back to the dark side, also known as Walnut st (or Shadyside in general), all too often."}
{"text":"Automatic five stars for serving Marriage Frères tea.  When I turned twenty one, I was living in Paris where the drinking age is much younger.  Being that the particular birthday wasn't as special there, I decided to make it special by having a tea party at Marriage Frères. Best tea I've ever had.  And here it is, in Pittsburgh though I haven't been able to find it outside of Paris since.  The crèpes are authentic and lovely and they definitely serve it up with some authentic French manners.  When you go, make sure to have tea with your meal."}
{"text":"You order at the counter, take a seat, and wait for your food to be served. Simple enough, but on the Sunday afternoon that I found myself here, I found it took far longer than I expected to just order.  All the tables were filled and there were a fair number coming in for takeout as well. I ordered the smoked salmon crepe, which came with a salad and it was just okay. Pretty expensive for a not-so-generous portion of salmon that wasn't very flavorful even with the creme fraiche. Service was really friendly and the atmosphere was calm as the place began to clear out a bit. My friend had a sweet crepe, which he enjoyed quite a bit so maybe I need to come back and give this place another try. 

They take credit cards now!"}
{"text":"Made an impromptu brunch here when a Sunday appointment had a longer wait than expected. Really yummy crepes! And at least for me, I can always tell that the ingredients are high quality when I have lots of creamy/cheese food and my stomach doesn't get angry with me! I got a tomato and cheese savory crepe with the bechamel sauce and added pineapple. (If you've read some other reviews of mine, you know that I think pineapple can go with anything...)

The coffee was average, but I really enjoyed the housemade champagne dressing that came with the salad. Would definitely stop in again next time I'm in that part of town.

Oh! and they do accept credit cards now!"}
{"text":"I love their waffles and red tea!! The atmosphere is so relaxing :-)gret place to go :-)"}
{"text":"I really like having a cappuccino here once in a while and I pair it with a nutella crepe. For lunch I've had their panini and the savory crepes and I personally prefer the former. Both come accompanied with a tangy salad. 
The service is fast but getting a table is difficult around noon on most weekdays so go a little bit later in the afternoon. During lunch hours this is not the best place for meetings either because it tends to get pretty loud."}
{"text":"Changed my perception of what crepes could be. I've had crepes before, at a lot of places, but never anywhere as good as here. The crepe itself was so delicate and the toppings, cheese and blueberry, were so fresh and delicious. I am used to them having chocolate, or Nutella, with whipped cream, which always felt like those flavors carried the crepe. But in this case, all the components worked together to make a delicious, delicate treat that I will be going back for.  
To top it off, I tried one of their chocolate croissant and that was so flaky, with great chocolate, and warm!"}
{"text":"A really popular place in the neighborhood. I had breakfast crepe. It was good enough for me to finish all of it in pleasure. But it was also too normal for me to remember anything about the food after the brunch."}
{"text":"Frequented this place back in college when I wanted a lighter lunch and needed to get a little further away from Pitt's campus food offerings. The French \"panini\" and savory crepes are just as I remembered. The vegetables are always fresh and the mixed greens salad served on the side with vinaigrette is the perfect accompaniment. They also now accept cards (!) and have a liquor license. If you have time to catch up with a friend and take a leisurely lunch, nothing would be better than coming into Crepes Parisiennes on a cold day and splitting a crepe and one of the French ciders that they now carry. Their beer selection is also charmingly French (and French Canadian), and they offer Fin du Monde, one of my favorites. I also love trying new things from their unique tea list. 

Recently enjoyed the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe with a crisp cider. A little pricey for portion, but there aren't many similar options in the Oakland area. You can find Liege waffles here as well as in Schenley Plaza, but I like having something more savory in the afternoon. I love the lighting from the big window in front, but overall the decor is pretty minimal."}
{"text":"This place is located in my favorite Walnut St.I just love walking in this place and enjoying the good vibes.And we came to this place for brunch and ordered veggie crepes.

  The place was small and completely packed. And their service was slow,i blame it on the crowd. The crepe was like paper,but it totally dissolved in your mouth. The lightest brunch ever!

  If you hate eating heavy meals,then this is the place for you.The place somehow reminded me of old European movies,with the old round tables and wooden chairs arranged very close to each other and to add a cherry to the cake, this was a house converted into a restaurant.

 I would love to go back here to try the Desert crepes :) 

-Smriti"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness-- best crepes ever! they have a chocalate banana crepe that is one of the best deserts out there!! or maybe you want to eat a little healthier-- the egg and cheese and the ham and egg crepe are both GREAT choices for a protein breakfast!! So So Good! The have a nice little shop and everyone is friendly-- also of great importance--very fast, speedy service but fresh food !!
A + check it out next time you are in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"The food here is really quite good, but your experience will depend a lot on when you come. If you come during peak hours on the weekend, expect a long wait for a table, hurried service, and feeling like you're being rushed to get out of there. However, come during off hours on a weekday and you'll get a relaxing meal in a great atmosphere

I've had both the savory and sweet crepes here, and particularly love the Black Forest one. This is a great place to come with a friend and split two crepes to get a taste for both the savory and sweet ones. The portions are fine for someone my size, but can see them being a little underwhelming for someone with a big appetite.

All in all, a good choice on Craig Street. Just try to avoid it on the weekends"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and in my opinion the best place for french crepes.  I've tried many crepes places in Manhattan and no one comes close.  David and his wife are very friendly and always want there customers to be happy! Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"What a charming little gem in North Oakland! Every once in a while, I'll venture out from Forbes Ave to the different and slightly more expensive options on Craig. The french toast crepe is delicious (served with real maple syrup) and my cafe au lait was up-to-par as well. My friends that came with me ordered the white forest (white chocolate, whipped cream, and rasperries) and the Nutella (simple, but great nonetheless!). If you want to put an intimate spin on your normal bagel-and-coffee date, give Crepes Parisiennes a try!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighborhood place that serves pretty tasty (albeit somewhat limited) options.  The crepes are good, though they best function as a light meal (if you come in really hungry, one crepe probably won't do the trick).  The sweet and savory crepes alike are well done and extremely consistent.  And the prices are reasonable.  It'd be nice if the hours were extended a bit (I'm not sure about the logic involved in closing at 5PM...it's hard to imagine the 4 to 5 hour being more profitable than 5 to 6 would be), so you pretty much have to come for brunch or lunch.

There's only partial table service, and at peak hours it can get pretty crowded.

If you're looking for a recommendation, my favorite crepe is the ham and cheese with bechamel sauce."}
{"text":"Not as in love with this place as I used to be. It is still convenient and a cool experience if you've never had crepes before, but it's alright.

(review from 12/24/15)"}
{"text":"dear god, this place is heavenly. i usually like the dessert stuff, but that soytang with tomato and cheese could make a convert out of me. the side salad is NOT a throwaway. and my boyfriend HATES french stuff usually, but even he likes this place. alot. we live right around the corner from this place; can't believe our luck! and tea drinkers--this is your spot! lots of fun mags, too."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I love the crepes, especially the Chocolate Banana.  I always take guests here when they come to visit, because they're always impressed.  Their hot chocolate is amazing!  I like the French theme, but it does need a little updating.  Chairs are uncomfortable.  Service isn't that great.  But, the crepes are so good that it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch since it is near where I work in Oakland and I was pleasantly surprised.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and it's hard to see in from the small window and being raised up from the street so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It just seemed dark and small.  But when I went in it looked like a little French cafe with a decent amount of seating.  They have a really nice range of crepes, from savory to sweet, including some breakfast crepes with egg.  They also have some salads and paninis.  I had the ham, egg and cheese breakfast crepe with a bechamel sauce that came with a small side salad of spring greens and vinaigrette.  The coffee made from the espresso bar is also excellent.  It looked like they had free wifi and some people were there working on their laptops.  Seemed like a good place to either eat there or get a quick crepe to go.  Service (that you order at the counter) was quick and friendly.  Prices were very affordable. I'll definitely. go back.  Only drawback is hours are somewhat limited with them closing mid-afternoon."}
{"text":"Food was good! Lovely crepe and a decent cup of coffee. It IS cash only but wasn't too bad.

At least when I was here, the ambience felt a little weird: a little French, but also part of the decor felt bland. They were playing some calming French music though, so no Top 40 while I was here. I'd come again."}
{"text":"SETTING:
Easy to miss along the street (keep an eye out for their blue sign). Hardwood floors, clean, small and cozy, seats parties of 2-4 people, open kitchen if you want to sneak a peak. Casual. Top 40s music playing in the background.

FOOD:
Looking for some light brunch? Need to take a break from the craziness that is your world? Get yourself a \"Crepe Escape\".

Savory or sweet, choose your own adventure. I usually like savory breakfast/brunch foods, but I had to switch it up this once. There are just so many sweet options that all look delicious! If you like Nutella, berries, chocolate, they got you covered.   

I went with the banana waffle crepe. It's what you would imagine how it would taste. Drizzled in syrup. Slices of banana hiding inside. Walnuts sprinkled on the plate with whipped cream on the side. I tried to go slow, but probably still wolfed it down relatively quickly. Not too sweet and definitely not heavy.     

SERVICE:
Cash monies only. Order up front and they give you a number before you seat yourself. Self-serve for water. They will bring out your order to your seat once it's out (less than 10 minutes).  

IMPRESSIONS:
Portion size was okay. I definitely wouldn't mind a larger quantity since I was quite hungry (what else is new). Perfect for a light meal when you catch up with a friend. If you're looking for something light and tasty, this fits the bill perfectly. I kind of wish they had a better selection of music (jazz, french, etc) to round out the cafe atmosphere. Top 40s seemed a bit out of place. The place gets busy though, so come early!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Had to wait in line but table freed up in time.  Well worth the wait.  I had a savory crepe and the wife and son had chocolate!  They have panini stop if that's your thing.  I really liked the French hard cider - it went really well with my ham and cheese crepe.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche, ham and cheese with their soytang sauce and plain butter with sugar.  

The place gets a bit crowded around noon and they have a pretty strict policy about ordering before you choose a seat.  Also, they only take cash (crepes run $7-9 plus $2 drinks).

They may have some mildly unpleasant/unpopular 'rules' but I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Crepes Parisiennes is simply perfect.

I have been going here for years, the experience is the same and it never gets old.  Even better now that they take credit cards!

There is almost always a line on the weekends.  You must wait in line prior to getting a table. This is how they manage the seating.  At first it can seem annoying, but they know what they are doing and it works out perfectly everyone that you have a table ready for you once you have ordered.

I order the same thing everytime.  Ham, cheese, add spinach and bechemel crepe.  Simple and delicious.  The side salad with the beautiful vinaigrette pairs perfectly.  It looks small, but the portion is hearty and filling. 

If I am feeling hungry and have a dining partner, I'll also get a classic Nutella and banana crepe with the whipped crepe and walnuts. It's so decadent and just the right vessel for warm Nutella.

And now I'm craving crepes!!"}
{"text":"I would give them four stars for their savory crepes (which are amazing - so if you're reading yelp to get lunch instead of sweets, do go!), but they only get a meh three because of their sweet crepes. I also might have given them more stars if their name didn't involve Paris, but since they're trying to say they are Parisian Crepes, they just don't get that fourth star. 

The crepes in Paris were light and fine and warm and just sweet enough and simply perfect. The butter and sugar crepe here lacked in the following ways: 1) granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar, 2) folded into an untransportable square, 3) dripping in butter, 4) practically fried in butter so the sugar caramelized. Again, it was tasty indeed. But if you are expecting to get Parisian style and quality crepes, this is not the place :("}
{"text":"To die for! I wish it were bigger so we could always get in to eat!! Super cute and delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes!  Had the salmon crepe Sandra the mushroom & cheese.  Black Forest crepe for dessert (dark chocolate, raspberries, whipped cream)   Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice over the last few months, and both times it's been a nice change from the usual Craig St. fare.  The smoked salmon crepe is good but on the light side.  The turkey avocado panino is really tasty.  This is one of the few places you can get vegetables that aren't fried (they come with a nicely dressed side salad) within walking distance of CMU, and prices are very reasonable.  Downsides: it's hard to get a table at lunch and they only take cash."}
{"text":"I love it here. It's so cute inside and so French. I honestly don't know how \"French\" it actually is because I've never been to France, but from what I imagine France to be like, it's French. 

The crepes, sweet or savory are delicious!! I think I prefer the sweet ones. Anything with nutella is so good. It's a good place to go for brunch with a friend. I can't wait to go when I get home again.

The wait staff is really friendly and you can watch them make crepes too! It's cool how they do it. I give props because I tried making crepes before.. and it's really hard to get it nice and thin.

I like how the seating works too because you order and then sit down.. but sometimes there's not enough seats so that's an issue, but the staff knows that and won't make your food until you have somewhere to sit so it's not like you're standing around with food and nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance."}
{"text":"I like the extensive option of crepes fillings ranging from more hearty items such as eggs and sausage to different fruits and chocolates. I opted for the crepes filled with white chocolate and raspberries and really enjoyed the pairing. Next time, I'll probably choose to have the whipped cream and walnuts to add a bit more textural contrast.

To summarize a few reoccurring comments from other reviews and from my personal experience: 1) Crepes Parisiennes has short hours, so you should check the hours before you go; 2) they accept cash only; 3) follow the simple rules."}
{"text":"I usually like this place for their yummy crepes & delicious coffee but the staff there is just RUDE! One time a server moved my personal belongings from one of the chairs where I was about to sit, my coffee in hand, only to give it to someone else when I was rightfully next in Line for the table. As unfair as that was, I would have been fine if the server had been polite but instead he chose to be terribly insulting & ignored his co-server's reasoning for letting me be seated! Disrespectful!"}
{"text":"The menu is very exciting (where else are you going to find these things in Pittsburgh?), the staff is incredibly attentive and gracious, and the drinks and plates are prepared with care. I got a London Fog, tea with steamed milk, but asked to have it on ice with no problems. I didn't exactly prefer the tea I picked, but I'm definitely coming back to try other options!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the area and were looking for something to eat, and this sounded most appealing of the restaurants around. I wasn't too hungry, but my wife wanted something substantial, and we were able to find both there.

My wife ordered a ham and cheese panini, which comes with a side salad with a really nice vinaigrette. I tried some of the sandwich, and it was very tasty - bread was nice and crusty, cheese was melted nicely, and the ham was just right.

I ordered a nutella and berries crepe, with whipped cream on top. This was quite tasty, and both of us really appreciated the volume of nutella in there!"}
{"text":"Crepes here are delicious, but it can be difficult to find a seat on a busy Sunday morning/afternoon.

While I can't speak to the sweet crepes (I prefer savory), my ham and cheese crepe was delicious and the coffee was excellent, as well. I think that a frenchman would be pleased with what he found were he to visit."}
{"text":"This is a welcome change from the average quality of food on Craig St.  The crepes are pretty delicious and consistent, with fresh ingredients and reasonable prices.

It's also not usually very crowded here, which makes it the more appealing sibling to its Shadyside location.  Don't forget that it's cash only!  Although sometimes the service can be curt, I have generally found it to be pleasant as long as you follow the protocol (order at the counter, have cash readily on hand, etc).  Also, there is a giant tank of self-serve water and cups at the right side of the counter, which is always a nice touch.

The interior is modern and clean cut, with exposed brick and small wooden tables.

Although their coffee is not the best, I personally think it beats out Starbucks' coffee by a wide margin.  And their espresso-based drinks are very decent.  Definitely the best you will find anywhere on Craig St, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"You guys...oh no, but I think this place was bought out! I walked by and saw a sign about ANOTHER waffle place coming soon. Ugh.

That being said, yeah, I love this place. I am such a fan of the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. God, so good. I can now say that having been to France, this place is pretty legit!

My only complaint is that I don't really get very full eating here. And it's kind of pricey for not getting you full. But whatever! Delicious. I really hope it's not closed."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes!

My wife and I love this place.  We often stop by and try different crepes, my favorite has to be the Russian blintz and her's is the Nutella and banana.  I highly recommend getting a Cafe Au-Lait with your crepe.  

No complaints about this cozy little creperie."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday morning.  To explain our devotion to this place, I should say that we drove down from Butler in order to get our crepes fix before our friend's early afternoon wedding.  You see, we used to go here every Friday after our first (and last) class of the day in college.  It was/is a mild obsession- a love affair of sorts.

When we got here just before 10:00, we saw that it wasn't open yet.  It was slightly odd that we stood outside until 10:15 before they opened the door.  I think that instead of making customers wait, they should just open the restaurant later, but whatever.

We walked downstairs and got in line at the register.  I was so happy to see that nothing had changed- I ordered the mixed veggie crepe with soytang sauce, and a nonfat cafe au lait.  They only accept cash, so come prepared.  I paid, took our number, and sat down.  The space is really small, so it does fill up, but it's perfectly cozy.  Our crepes were as good as ever, and including my coffee drink, my bill came in at just over $10.00.

The owner is very friendly, and normally behind the crepe maker.  This is a great place to have brunch or dessert- they also have sweet crepes (Nutella and banana is my favorite)- so be sure to check it out. It's right off of Walnut Street, so you can easily stop in before or after an afternoon of shopping."}
{"text":"This place only takes cash.  Thank goodness there's only a ton of ATMs on the Carnegie Mellon and U. Pitt campus.

Cost:   ~ 7 dollars a crepe depending on what you get

The ordering process is similar to Panera, and La Madeline, where you order, grab a number, and sit down.  Someone will bring the food over and that will probably be the last time you see him/her.  From ordering to receiving food took about 5 minutes or so.

Food Experience from beginning to end:
I really loooove crepes, especially sweet crepes.  It's a bit past lunch time and I'm starving.  My sister and I walk in and there's a bunch of folks in there, talking and having a good time.  This place was happening!  This place isn't exactly big.  The seating area is pretty small but it was pretty cozy.  The atmosphere is pretty good as well.  When we walked in, we grabbed the last open table and it wasn't even peak dining time!  I can easily see this place get crowded during lunchtime.

The menu has savory crepes and sweet crepes - savory being the an actual meal, and of course sweet is for dessert.  My sister and I wanted both for lunch so we ordered one of each and decided to split.  

For the savory crepe, we tried out the breakfast crepe which contains sausage, egg and cheese.  It comes with a small spinach and mandarin orange salad on the side with a small container of oil and vinagrette dressing.  The salad is very good but also very small.  It's not really there as a side dish but as something there to complement the crepe.  The size of the crepe is not that big as well.  it measured probably 3in by 4 in.  The crepe itself was nothing to write home about.   It contained little salt which is great for me, but for salt lovers out there, this is not the crepe for you.

As for the dessert crepe, I really wanted nutella with fresh strawberries and bananas.  Unfortunately, they don't serve that since they don't have fresh strawberries, just fresh bananas.  The only kind of berries they have is this compote that is super sugary.  Between the rich nutella spread and the berry compote, it was pretty sweet.  The crepe is topped with a generous portion of whipped cream.  The whip cream is actually not sweet at all.  I ate my crepe with the cream to balance out the sugar a bit.   

In summary, I think this place is really cute for atmosphere and nice to have when you need a crepe fix.  It's really a nice place to hang out with friends and crepes are easily sharable.  I enjoyed my experience here but it doesn't make it on my \"omg i must return to eat here\" list for the next time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Note #1: CASH ONLY!

Note #2: Place your order BEFORE taking a seat (y'know, like the sign says), be well-mannered, follow the rules, and you'll most likely have a pleasant time at this pleasant creperie. 

Note #3: CP has a fairly broad menu that not only includes savory and dessert crepes, but also sandwiches, salads and other such brunchtime fare. 

Indulging in reverse due to The O's lack of desserts, I came to Crepes Parisiennes prior to haunting Phantom of the Attic on a recent, frosty Saturday afternoon and encountered a most extraordinary treat while witnessing no foul tempers. 

A coy yet seductive creature of the woods, The Black Forest Crepe has a hide that is thin, wheat-imbibed, and as light and fleeting as a fallen snowflake. Inside, however, is a chocolate pool that is relentlessly dark, immorally, immortally rich, and fit for the damned alone, a group which I myself may be included in. It not only oozed, it glissaded across my plate, advancing, threatening to bring about delectable doom.

A tuft of fresh (!) whipped cream acted as the holy artifact, repelling not only the wickedness of the chocolate but the crimson raspberries and their unstoppable, shockingly brazen tartness. Resembling a dozen demoniac brains, they were gorily spilled onto a point of the accursed, occult, inverted delta itself, adding a fevered fervor to an already malevolent masterpiece. 

Quite real, Crepes Parisiennes harbors true evil within shrouds of pan-fried batter. Dismiss the innocuous decor and lovely females (sirens?) and partake only with the utmost courage, purest of spirits...or a death wish..."}
{"text":"Just had a savory crepe! I walked in a little late but the service accommodated me by taking my last order for their savory crepes which I greatly appreciated. I had a spinach egg and cheese with a creamy garlic sauce. It was just fabulous because the crepe was light, and the sauce was not too salty. Everything went so well and they served the spinach egg and cheese enclosed in the crepe in a folded thin square form. On the side was mixed greens with a side of dressing and oranges. I was very impressed with my experience. As I'm writing this review a jazzy French music is playing over my head as I watch a couple drink a delicately presented cappuccino. I highly recommend it. And the prices aren't even that bad!"}
{"text":"Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The quality and consistency is excellent. The owner is the head chef, And will come to recognize you if you are a repeat customer. The ordering and seating routine is a little unusual. You stand in line and place an order and then get a number. Only then are you supposed to sit at a table. This does make sense since people cannot just sit at a table when there's a long line of people waiting to order. Just an FYI. The crapes are simple, but always good. I usually get the tomato and cheese and add an egg. The coffee is okay. I only wish they opened a little bit earlier."}
{"text":"I love their crepes here. Especially the smoked salmon one. Mmmm. Nutella is good too.

Yes the wait can be disparaging sometimes, but the trick is to go during off hours. I don't really eat lunch at \"normal\" times anyway so I always get a seat. My mom loves their salmon crepe too, and I must say, the quality of food is worth a trip, if you are in the neighborhood. I used to come here all the time after school (I went to Winchester) as it was a quick walk after class or during finals week break."}
{"text":"The best crepes in Pittsburgh, period. I've eaten here probably 30+ times over the years, and every single time the crepes have been great. Highly recommend the Macaroon and the Russian Blintz."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes. Really. The savory ones (like the smoked salmon), the sweet ones, all of them are just plain great. The restaurant is actually a tiny basement of a Shadyside-style home. They try hard to make it feel like France by making it narrow, crowded, lacking air conditioning, and cash-only. Those are the drawbacks, but it adds to the authenticity I suppose. Also, they have Evian and Orangina, which is always nice. If you need breakfast - can't beat the crepes here. Go, eat, have fun, forget where you are for a while."}
{"text":"Ham and cheese crepe with bechamel sauce, side salad with a tangy champagne vinaigrette and mandarins on top. Add to a perfect cup of hot chocolate or orangina, and it's the most delicious breakfast/brunch meal you could imagine. As a Pittsburgher for 5 years, I spent much of my 2 years in Shadyside as a regular here - often taking new people and having large brunches with friends and students. 

When going, keep in mind you'll be waiting in a line to order- the line does pause until more tables open up, so be patient. It is quick though and WELL worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely fresh and simple. I had a breakfast crepe with sausage, egg and cheese, with creme fraiche, which was delicious and incredibly filling. The side salad was a simply handful of mixed greens with a homemade and quite tasty champagne vinaigrette, and a few slices of tangerines (which should have been fresh but were canned). My mom had the same crepe, we split a soda and had a chocolate pastry, which was also wonderful. Our lunch came in just under $20. I would absolutely go again for another savory crepe, and to try anything with Nutella!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, which is what causes the common wait however its definately worth the wait. The vegetarian crepe is one of the most amazing meals you could ask for the tomatoes are slightly spicy and the soytang dressing compliments the crepe well. This is one restaurant I doubt I would ever tire of. I would often go with friends order a savory crepe and split a sweet one with a friend!

My mouth is watering just thinking of the yummy food!"}
{"text":"Such delicious food!  Perfect portions!  The dessert AND savory crepes are all so wonderful!  Love it here!!!!"}
{"text":"Ooh I really like this place! I wouldn't come here for a full meal, but the crepes here are really tasty. I had a Berry French Toast crepe that I really liked. It was just the right amount of sweetness. The maple syrup it comes with is wonderfully light. Seating is limited though, so the line may get long."}
{"text":"The breakfast crepe with béchamel sauce is the best crepe on the planet! I have made many a trip to Pittsburgh under the guise of visiting my boyfriend.  Little did he know that I was really taking the 4.5 hour flight from San Francisco to have three or four of the best crepes ever created. 

As I said before, the Breakfast Crepe is the best. It has egg, cheese, breakfast sausage and your choice of one of a few different sauces (the béchamel is the best). The BF likes his crepes on the sweeter side, so he enjoys the nutella and banana. The savor crepes are served with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet crepes have whipped cream.  

Seriously, this place is amazing. If you live in the Pittsburgh, or are visiting you are doing yourself a disservice by not treating yourself to this absolutely fabulous, terrific, superb, and wonderful restaurant. No joke...now that the BF has graduated and no longer lives in Pittsburgh, I have thought about flying over just to eat at Crepes Parisiennes."}

{"text":"It's been 2 years since I was in Pittsburgh and I still talk about this place!! Never eaten a crepe that can match this place (and the hot chocolate and the chocolate croissant). The owners are great people. They don't like to waste food and will usually throw in a free pastry if its end of day (hint hint ;) )"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Paris and so was glad to see that there was a crepe place near me. I've been to both locations of Crepes Parisiennes though the other on Craig Street feels less comfortable and homey than Filbert Street. There are more props up in the Filbert Street and I'm not talking about the stacks of nutella that they have. I've had both their savory (comes with side salad) and sweet crepes - which are all delicious. Not exactly like what you would get in Paris at a food stand (sugar crepe wrapped in paper) but is enough to bring back nostalgia of my visit so I am a fan. The wait has never been terrible and the staff has been friendly. I believe they are cash only which is a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Decent little crepe place in a cozy part of oakland.  I had one crepe with maple syrup and fund it not filling enough.  The coffee was a little weird"}
{"text":"Pretty good Crepes.
I had Black Forest Crepes, which is Chocolate crepe topped with raspberries.
They now have Liege waffle. Not bad but can't beat Waffalonia's."}
{"text":"I wish this place was open for longer hours! For the past couple of months, I've had a tricky time trying to make it here, so I'm happy that I finally managed to get here for lunch.  I visited on a Tuesday around 12:30. It was tiny inside, and it was packed, but the food was totally worth the wait! Actually, I was slightly relieved that there was a line, so that I could have time to decide on my order because the menu was pretty extensive in terms of crepes and waffles.  

I finally (after serious contemplation) decided on the smoked salmon crepe with creme fraiche sauce.  All savory crepes included a side salad, so I had a salad with mandarin oranges and champagne vinaigrette.  My salad was really good, but my crepe was even better....I never wanted it to end! The smokey flavor and saltiness was exactly what I was expecting (and hoping for) when I ordered it! 

When I was leaving, I noticed that some people were stopping in and taking crepes to go, I will have to remember to treat myself to one of their dessert crepes soon! I would strongly recommend it to those looking for a change in their regular lunch break routine!"}
{"text":"I made my second trip here with my family of 6. Everyone loved it and we went back for another round 3 days later. I was here 2 years previously and it was just as amazing. I had a breakfast and a desert crepe and was very satisfied with them. Place is very small but comfortable and pleasant, with an amazing staff.

I will be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"This is the best crepes place I've ever been to! They have about 15 savory and 15 sweet options...all of which are really good. Also, be sure to get a hot chocolate! The only downside is that they can be slow and you can't sit down at a table until you order, so sometimes you're standing around for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Is there a way to give this dump a 0?  We just left because we stood in line to place an order like everyone else and were told we couldn't place an order.  I asked why and he said because we had more than 2 people..:we had 3.  We were a bit confused and left because we had waited In line and told we couldn't order.  Way to suck major D."}
{"text":"These guys are not trying to reinvent the proverbial wheel- they serve up solid crepes and a darn good latte. They serve it quickly, at a moderate price, and the staff are friendly and will remember you the next time you come. The last time I was there was with a friend with a baby- without asking, a staff person came over and brought a high seat when she saw my friend struggling. that's kind service."}
{"text":"Get there early. This is a busy popular place especially on a Saturday morning. We ordered chocolate waffle with berries and a chocolate croissant. They were both excellent. In fact the chocolate croissant was probably the best croissant of any type that we have had. It was so good I would've been very happy with just a plain croissant. The coffee was a little strong for me but exactly as you would expect and excellent. 
The chef is extremely serious about excellence and is there working very hard entire time. Not handicapped accessible. Can be crowned it be prepared to wait for table or if it's a nice day there is a couple of outdoor tables to sit at"}
{"text":"This place is great! I came here around lunch time on a Saturday with two of my girl friends. It was crowded, apparently we can't take a table unless we already ordered. We were thinking we definitely cannot get a table but as soon as we finished ordering a table is available and ready for us. I am a fatty so I ordered two items, I got their dark chocolate waffle and the salmon crepes. At first I looked on yelp and looked around me, no one seems to order waffles so I was a bit hesitate but....Wow the dark chocolate waffle is phenomenal. I'm so happy I ordered it, it has to be one of my favorite waffles id ever had. The salmon crepes was good but not as good as the one I had in cafe moulin. My friend got the hams and cheese one, that one was probably my favorite out of all we ordered. Yuuum, I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"So delicious and a great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I live a block away and just went to this place for the first time today. I will be back for some more savory crepes that's for sure

I have a theory that I have never had a bad experience when I had to walk down stairs to get into a restaurant, bar, bookshop or breakfast joint. The charming feel of crepes  parisiennes tucked away from the rest of Shadyside proves my theory right once again."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in several years. And I mean several. I have to say the crepes were good but not like I remembered them. Perhaps an off day? I will say I did still enjoy what I ate but just didn't get that wow factor as in past visits. I walk past the restaurant several times a week so I'll definitely give them another try. Though with so many great places in the city for food it's tough to go back to mediocre."}
{"text":"This place was pretty authentic! I loved the menu choices and the crepes were delicious! 

My brother and I had the \"Paris Fog\" drink. It was tea with steamed milk. We both chose the Emperor something tea? It tasted like a campfire. No lie. It was a little odd but with some sugar, it was tasty! 

I had the Russian Blintz crepe with sweet cheese and blueberry preserves and walnuts on top. It was really yummy! Tasted like cheese blintzes. My brother had the maple syrup crepe and his boyfriend had the orange and chocolate one. We all loved them and agreed that they all tasted very authentic. 

Parking was easy to find (Friday at 1:30pm, Veteran's Day: it was free because of the holiday)

I would definitely come back here and try a savory crepe next time!"}
{"text":"The crepes are an easy choice to love - dessert and savory are both great, but I LOVE the paninis here. The tomato basil and mozzarella is my favorite and sometimes I got multiple times in the same week! It does get very crowded and you can't order if there's no seating so I like to call ahead and take it to go."}
{"text":"You come here for the first time, you may think you're walking into some mystery basement.  You come here with a friend who's also never been here, they may think you're taking them somewhere scary.  Thankfully, neither of those are true!  

As soon you walk in the door, you're comforted by the fact that it's just a cozy little basement restaurant!  Coming here at 2pm on a weekday, you'll also be joining the ladies who lunch, just fyi, this is Shadyside after all!  I actually got the idea to come later (after the lunch rush) because of the Yelp reviews.  Good thing I did because the ladies who lunch had taken every table except for one!

Looking at the menu, the first thing that struck me was that this wasn't a lunch place!  Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  

Now I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  

Hot Tip:  Cash only!  Come on off peak times because it's tiny and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat during lunch hours or Saturday/Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"The cafe is relatively small, but was empty when I went on an early Saturday afternoon. The ambience is very laid back and relaxing by. I was recommended the smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and crème fraîche by the cashier. The crepe had a beautiful thin slice of smoked salmon. The crème fraîche really enhances the dish and gives it a nice kick of salty and sour. The mixed green salad came with a vinaigrette and was topped with mandarin oranges. Nothing special per se, but the oranges really do a disservice to the entire salad. It tasted as if they were bathing in a syrup. Other than that, this establishment was wonderful.

I am looking forward to trying their sweet crepes in the future."}
{"text":"There are only 2 downsides to this place: limited seating and limited hours. Many times I have wanted to come here in the evening, but they are always closed by 5pm! You order first, before claiming seats, and if you get to the front of the line and there are no seats available for your group, they will not allow you to order (you can order to go)

The last time I came here was with a group of 6 people. Despite a substantial line, we miraculously managed to get a table.  With such a large group, we got to try a lot of the menu, and we loved everything! Some highlights:

On the banana Nutella crepe: \"some places skimp on the Nutella, but this place really adds a lot!\"

On the breakfast crepe: \"there's so much cheese!\"

On the mozzarella/pesto panini: \"this is amazing!\"

I personally went with the mixed vegetable crepe (with tomato, mushroom, and cheese), and I really liked the flavor and texture of the crepe itself. The French toast crepe is also definitely worth trying

Also their drip coffee is pretty good, and they have a wonderful tea selection (mariage freres)!

I would highly recommend, just be warned that you might not be able to sit here"}
{"text":"They are unique to Pittsburgh and the crepes are outstanding.  The owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who I was with this morning who frequent much more than I do.  The place was packed at 2 PM on a saturday I can't imagine it being comfortable on a Sunday or Saturday AM.  The wait staff in general is off and I'm really not sure why.  I mean sure they are busy, but in these types of non-franchise \"bohemian\" joints usually the 20 somethings are exceptionally nice.  Oh, well maybe this is part of the authentic Frecnch experience.  You do feel the need to eat quickly because of  the other customers eyeing you up for the precious few seats available.  Outside of the venue and service the crepes are the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh and if the service and venue was better this  could easily be four or maybe even five stars.  I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche' and it was perfect.  It had great quality ingredients and was truly delicious.  A friend had the ham and cheese which was also excellent and another had  just a  traditional crepe with maple syrup.  This was also a smashing success.  I think the owner needs to share with his young staff some of the hospitality he showed my friends, but I'm guessing they don't feel this is necessary since they seem to be at capacity already."}
{"text":"They now take cards. No wifi so don't come to work just eat. Bring your appetite and don't be shy, you'll want to try everything! And I mean EVERYTHING. This is by far the ultimate crepe and waffle cafe in the city. Please your tastebuds and your tummy!!! hope your visit is as swell as ours was."}
{"text":"when I was a young man in my college days at cmu, I graduated back in 2014. I made it a point to become very well aquainted with this place. as you would imagine I had many a hungover brunch on sunday and given the choice between pamela's and here, over the hundreds of times it came up, I chose this place every time. I wouldn't change a thing about it. It takes a certain place to be a semi sitdown fast little shop and make it feel as classy as it was. If you have never had or heard of a savory crepe stop what you are doing right now. park your car in the street if you have to and just sprint here for one right now. my personal favorite, the tomato and cheese, with béchamel was the perfet combination of savory and sweet in a healthy (enough) package. with a cup of coffee in a real ceramic cup, it makes for the best brunch or lunch in the city. every savory crepe is served with a fresh salad with mandarin oranges, overall impressive presentation and absolutely fantastic flavor. There is no excuse for not eating here, even if you have no cahs (it's cash only) there is a pnc atm at the corner of craig and 5th. get moeny and treat yourself to the best crepe you will ever have."}
{"text":"Cash only, but a really nice relaxing place to have some tea of coffee...and of course a crepe. While I opted for a sweet treat my other half has the spinach. I almost with I had ordered what he had. There was nothing wrong with mine at all, just a little too sweet for the early hour. The spinach crepe was really light, and quite tasty. I think it was one of the best things I had tried on my trip. I would for sure come back here again, no complaints."}
{"text":"A small place on Craig that always seems to be full of people - you have to walk in single file, between two lines of tables to get to the cash register. 

When my bf takes me here (almost once every visit - I love crepes), we usually end up having to make sure one of us grabs a table while the other orders. Upon placing the order, they give you a number, and the server will try to locate you when the food is ready. Kudos to their manuevering abilities.

I've never had much occasion to interact with the servers, so I can't speak much to the service...

...but the crepes are pretty good. The savory as well as the sweet. I wish I'd get more of the sweet, but I somehow can't bring myself to have crepes for both my meal and my dessert - it adds up, and, no, they're not really inexpensive. To lessen the guilt, I'd have to make sure I get one of the sandwiches for the meal instead - which are also quite good, but, oh, it's so hard to choose when all you're craving is that crepe!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast/lunch places that I had been to. The person who prepares the crepes always invites the guests with a bright smile even though he is busy preparing the food. Best part is sitting at the window beside the kitchen and watch him make crepes while waiting for your food. 

I usually get the sweet crepes and they are very tasty. I specially like the French toast crepe with walnuts and whip cream. I can probably eat that everyday. 

If you are going to this place on weekends, expect a wait time of atleast 10 minutes."}
