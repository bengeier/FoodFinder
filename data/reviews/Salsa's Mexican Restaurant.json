{"text":"We have been going here for years.  Prior to them acquiring the neighboring business space, adding the Dancefloor, Sunday brunch buffet, and tortilla maker, and renaming themselves to Cabo's.  Think I preferred the \"small\" before a little better, but the food is still terrific. (Used to see the same waiters and waitresses and they were very customer oriented.)

Salsa and chips are delicious as well as the Sangria. One of my favorites is the Burrito California and my kids love the fajitas.  Big disappointment the last time I went was the $1 charge for extra tortillas. They used to be free (you only get 3 tortillas for double fajitas, not enough!)

Will keep going there for the consistently delicious food."}
{"text":"The Food was good.. However, they were very shady at the end. The check came, I looked at it and it was right. I gave them my card and the manager (not the waiter) brought me back the check having been authorized for a different amount (about $10 more). He claimed \"things were missing\" from the original check. I asked for the detail and he left.. the Waiter came back in 10 minutes looking for the signed check. I told him the manager was bringing me the details, he left... 10 minutes later after asking 2 more times I decided $10 wasn't worth it and I signed it and left."}
{"text":"We only go for chips/dip and margaritas bc food dishes are blah!!!! Even then we have to tell them how to make it. Wish the would play music but apparently when asked they said many elderly patrons don't want it. I say play me some Mexican music. If noone likes it tell them to stay home. You can be at a restaurant/ bar and no music."}
{"text":"Been here many times for lunch.  Good portion size and drink is included.  They have expanded which makes it much more comfortable on those busy lunch days.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Was in town for a 2 day visit and stopped by this place for lunch with 2 guests.  We were in a bit of a hurry as we had a meeting scheduled in about an hour.  Food was quite good and fresh.  Service was excellent and speedy.  We had some of the lunch specials and they were very reasonable.  Would definitely stop by next  time in town."}
{"text":"Closed as of 21 AUG 13.  Outdoor tables and umbrellas gone, sign gone, closed sign on both doors and newspaper covering both doors.  Shame, it was a decent place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The other day my wife and I finally decided to try Salsas for the first time. Noticing huge dinner crowds and lines, we expected the experience to be great. Unfortunately we were unable to experience anything.  After we were seated, we waited for 10 minutes for someone get our drink order or even acknowledge we were at the restaurant.  After noticing many employees just pass us by we decided just to get up and leave. Wish I had a chance to try the food or something but this is a place that I will never go to or recommend because of the poor service."}
{"text":"This place is good for a cheap dinner. Just know you are getting what you pay for. Don't expect excellent Mexican food, but when 2 ppl can eat for $30 at a Sit down restaurant and they food is good and the sangria is excellent, who can complain. The staff is always super friendly and you can usually find a coupon in valpak or something like that."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive.  The service is above average.  The lunch specials are quite appealing, and the food itself is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. A big \"A-OK\". Nothing special, but it did the trick. Order the chimichanga lunch special w/shredded chicken and the typical rice and beans on the side. For 6.99, no complaints other than the chimichanga was not fried. Came out as a burrito...hmmm? Probably for the best anyway. Service was a little slow, as we sat outside on the patio and were forgotten about once. 

Will I return...sure; if someone says \"hey, I'm at Salsas come meet me\" Will I seek this place out for a meal other than that...no. However; it's a decent place for a Mexican lunch."}
{"text":"Try the Burrito California....excellent.  Chips and salsa are also good.  

With that being said, the last time the wife and I ate here the service was terrible.  I actually wrote the waitress's name down to add to my review but now I can't find it.  I never got a drink refill.  She took forever to get the check.  She was too busy socializing with her coworkers.  I just can't understand where people find wait staff like this.  If they don't take action they will lose business.

Update on 3-23-2013:  The waitress name on the reciept was Dulce M."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing chips and salsa. Can get pretty crowded around lunch but well worth it."}
{"text":"Salsa's has been at this location for a long time.  I believe they just changed the name to Cabo's.  The remodeled and added a stage for live entertainment.  I have been there several times.  I have discovered that branching out from the standard taco/enchilada/burrito is the way to go here.  I really like the Chile a la Mexicana, and the Tacos al Carbon.  Their chips and salsa is ok I like a spicier salsa.  
Their service is good. They have a brunch on Sunday, I was not impressed with that. They have decent margaritas and cold beers.  I will go back, and do recommend it."}
{"text":"I think they must have changed owners. The place looked completely different. The service was slow. I ordered a lunch plate of taco, enchilada, rice and beans. For the Mexican restaurant expert, the \"Speedy Gonzelas\" 

I think it was the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. Even Taco Bell's tacos were better tasting than this one. I took a few bites and asked for my check. The beans seemed to contain more lard than beans. The rice was dry and the salsa seemed to come right of the can.

If you looking for decent Mexican in the neighborhood, head to Cantina in Stonecrest or Senor Tequila on Rea Rd. Worth driving a few extra miles."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE AND THE FOOD WAS EVEN WORSE!!  The \"refried beans\" were a totally unrecognizable bluish-grey slop that did not even contain a bean and the food that could be visually affirmed as edible was very much under par and our order was wrong to boot.  When we brought up out concerns to our waitress she was totally unconcerned, did not bother getting a manager and took forever to take care of the problems. We are very easy to please and not demanding at all bug when both our food AND drink orders are wrong and the food is bad when we bring it to our waitresses attention, we have certain expectations.  I WOULC HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT."}
{"text":"This is now called Cabo's Mexican Grill. 

This is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed. The first time I went with a group of 3 other friends. The service was less than okay and food was mediocre, nothing really memorable.

The 2nd time was a couple of weeks ago, name change but the bad service stayed.

Went with a group of about 8 - 10 people on a Thursday night. Right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us. We ordered drinks and our food, food took longer than what we expected even with a big group. The server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for. To make matters worse, the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed, we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked. Worst part, we were so ready to leave and couldn't, our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up. 

I am rating it 3 stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didn't let us enjoy it."}
{"text":"Food was yummy! I had the combo platter with tacos and Mexican rice."}
{"text":"Salsa's gets a solid three stars from me. This location is small, but it's conveniently located if you live in the area. It's definitely the closest place to get a Mexican-ish fix for us.

I cannot tell a lie: The food at atmosphere are not particularly authentic. The salsa is too sweet and unspicy. The food, however, is passable, and the lunch specials are super duper cheap. In fact, they're so cheap, it makes the food taste better. You know what I'm talking about.

Salsa's doesn't quite deserve a \"Yay!\" Nor does it deserve a \"Meh!\" I'll let you know when I come up with an exclamation that fits between the two."}
{"text":"Eh. The only reason I would come back here is for the convience. The service was mediocre at best and the food was average. 

My mom ordered a Marg on the rocks and was given a 32 oz frozen margarita. No fresh options for margaritas although they do have Dos Equis in the bottle. 

If you are craving good Mexican food in a fun environment, look somewhere else. I will probably not return to Salsas, even if I have to drive 15 minutes out of the way."}
{"text":"This is a good Mexican restaurant but here are the noteworthy things:

#1: As Todd mentioned, this is very Americanized Mexican I think because lots of things on the menu come out as a burrito. I'm not an expert BUT I think I know the difference between a chimi, burrito, and enchilada. I am not sure Salsa's does.

#2: Very cool - THEY MAKE THEIR OWN TORTILLAS! There's a small woman in the front during dinner hours that shapes the dough, flattens them and bakes them while you're watching her. Really impressive.

#3: The service is always great. Never a long wait, the servers are quick to take your order, deliver drinks and check up on you.

#4: Salsa's Salsa is great. Muy bueno. Fantastico! Etc, etc.... just spicy enough for me, while still being ok for those of you who like Mild :)

Salsa's is always good in my book - I'll never complain when someone suggests going there!"}
{"text":"The best Tex-Mex in town, and I've had them all.  Local recipes, not a chain.  Great salsa/chips!   Steak anything is great, especially the Burrito Tequilla.  Spicy, but wonderful!"}
{"text":"We've always loved Salsa's, but always had two reservations about going there: 1. the bar area (where smoking was legal) was too close to a lot of seats, therefore you'd inhale smoke all night and 2. it got crowded fast on \"family\" nights.  We would usually just go for lunch to avoid the crowd.

Well, two thing happened: 1. North Carolina outlawed smoking in all restaurants and 2. Salsa's expanded!  They've added a fresh tortilla maker and a place for a live band.  We went last Friday night to see our friend's band play and it was the same great Salsa's food in a wonderful atmosphere.  There was still a wait for a table, showing that the place is even more popular now!

Menu recommendations:

Pork Carnitas - I challenge any one person to finish this.  My wife usually has 2-3 meals from it.

Any other fajita - all of them are great, but now add in the fresh tortilla experience and they are no longer \"just a fajita\".

Tacos al Carbon - a great hot sauce and the onion/cilantro combination make these tacos jump

Enchilada Suizas - when you're in the mood for enchiladas done differently with a tomatillo sauce and queso!

And, getting back to the live band, they had the volume of the band set perfectly.  You could clearly hear them, but you didn't have to shout to have a conversation at your table."}
{"text":"I eat at Salsa's pretty often for lunch.  They usually have great lunch specials and the staff is always friendly.  I usually get the lunch steak fajitas and I just added a picture of them.  They also come with rice, refried beans, sour cream, guac, and a little lettuce.  The reason that I always get the fajitas for lunch is because their so good!

If you go on a day that the lunch fajitas are on special they will run you $6.99 which includes your drink.  What a great deal for some awesome Mexican food!

They have also just started a brunch buffet on Sunday's!  I think it lasts from 11-3 or so.  It's great, but come hungry!  The buffet has chicken chimichangas, chicken and beef fajitas, rice, salad, cheese quesadillas, pork, fresh strawberries, melon, muffins, cereal, whip, shrimp, chicken tenders, fries, mashed potatoes, and the list goes on and on.  All of the food is really good!  They also will make you a made to order omelette with chorizo, cheese, or whatever you want all for the low price of $11.99 which includes your beverage.  Again, great food and for a great price and this is why they get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I went to Salsa's/Cabo's for the Sunday Brunch Buffet.  The fresh-made tortillas were wonderful and the service was excellent, but the food was just ok for me.   There was a good selection of items and everything was tasty, but some items were a bit too salty for my taste.   I may give it another try."}
{"text":"I do not quite get Salsa's.  They are a chain (albeit a regional chain), but the different locations I have been to are almost completely different.  Go figure.  To be fair to them, I suppose that is the same with just about any chain, regional or not.  Even individual restaurants have that problem from night to night.

Even the decor and environment at Salsa's is different, however - in Stallings it is almost sanitized American Mexican, while if you go to the location off 51, we have found a much more enjoyable experience.  I wish I knew the difference.  Maybe you just have a different clientele and they alter the experience accordingly.

The staff is friendly at both (though a bit slower at this location).  Neither is particularly authentic, compared to say, Unica.  And the food is reasonable, not inedible, but again not something authentic.  While not a bad experience, it is just difficult to find reason to go again when there are so many other (better) destinations - even within the same chain - that I enjoy more."}
{"text":"To take a step away from the more authentic Mexican places we've been eating lately, we decided to try out Salsa's, which is more towards the Americanized style of Mexican food.  That doesn't make it bad - just different, so if you're wanting authentic, you may want to go elsewhere.

Inside of this Salsa's, the decor is very nice.  The only complaint is the lighting.  Along the right side of the restaurant, the ceiling fans and the low lights combine to create a very annoying strobe affect.  It was so bad we had to move.  Once we did, it wasn't a problem at all.

Service was excellent, speedy and efficient all around.  Glasses were kept filled, and food came out quickly.  One thing I'll typically do at a new restaurant (new for me, not necessarily brand new) is ask for advice, and the waiter offered it.  A nice touch.  I hate it when they can't do so.

The food was tasty - ingredients were fresh, sauces were not overwhelming.  I had a (steak) chimichanga, and it was one of the better ones that I can recall tasting.  For this sort of Mexican, I'd highly suggest you try them out."}
{"text":"i love this place. went here for my first time and got a little tipsy off their house margaritas, i had some tacos and an enchilada and ended up taking most of it home because i stuffed my face with chips and salsa. lol. But it was good and their customer service was good. My waiter was really nice:)"}
{"text":"First off, a heads up. Though the business is listed here as Salsa's, it's now actually Cabo's. 

I stopped here spur of the moment for takeout lunch and ended up ordering the Chicken Taco Salad. It wasn't exactly what I was used to--the black beans and chicken were both hot. I prefer my taco salad cold because lettuce with really warm food is a little gross, so I ended up sticking it in the fridge to cool down before eating more. 

I'll give them credit for the serving size (and the chips made for a nice snack later on). However, I wasn't overly impressed with the service. I was charged for the dinnertime salad rather than the lunch one (keep in mind I came in at 1PM), but the guy at the counter wouldn't admit to it. What happened to the mantra, \"The customer is always right?\" I'm no Albert Einstein, but just eyeballing the receipt (and with the help of my handy calculator), it wasn't hard to figure out that I was.

Ok, ok...time to cool off! All in all, I was only charged $1.00 extra, but it was a complete turnoff that the Cabo employee wasn't being honest and tried to make up a mysterious extra charge."}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot in the Stevens Mill shopping center!

We went around lunch time and were one of the only customers in the restaurant. It's a small space with a lot of bright, colorful decorations. The staff was very pleasant and service was fast, but I can't really comment on conditions when others in the restaurant.

The lunch menu is one of the best I've seen - a $5 menu that leaves you sufficiently satisfied. I had the burrito and was surprised by the size of it. I wouldn't say, taste wise, it's the pinnacle of Mexican food in Charlotte, but it certainly hits the spot.

A great go-to for a south-of-the-border lunch."}
{"text":"This is a small place located at Stevens Mill Crossing. They've done a nice with the new bar area and during the summer they have outdoor seating on the large sidewalk. I've been here a couple of times and it's usually pretty busy. Last night's experience just wasn't much to write home about. The Pork Carnitas had good flavor but was way over cooked and dry. The chips seemed a little stale too. My wife had the Pollo Tropical, which consisted of 2 of the thinnest chicken breasts I've ever seen. The flavor, however, was very good. She also ordered the Tres Leches Cake to go. She started to eat it once we got home but had to throw it out. It tasted like it was freezer burnt. Not good. There are definitely better Mexican restaurants in the area. That's too bad, this one was so convenient."}
