{"text":"I've had plenty of corn dogs in plenty of different places.  But this is definitely the best.  Absolutely perfect!  Really huge with a really great all beef wiener.  The wiener is high quality with the perfect mix of spices and garlic. It is juicy as well.  The crust is perfectly crunchy, flavorful, and not greasy.  Considering the size, taste, and quality, this is a really good value.  This is a corn dog that you will remember for years!"}
{"text":"The Corn Dog Truck is just ok. It's a giant dog which is nice but it lacked flavor. Don't know how much it was because work provided it. Thanks guys.  Needless to say I probably won't visit it ever again. Now a bagel dog truck I could get behind!"}
{"text":"First time trying them today.  Just had to take a quick run down to the court house and they were outside.  I really enjoyed the corn dog and cheese bomb with honey.  They are light, fluffy and fresh.  They didn't make my stomach hurt from grease.  I would recommend the corn dog company over worlds best corn dog any day!  Prices are great hope to see them around town more."}
{"text":"My family had the privilege to enjoy the honey dogs.
Only problem can not ever find them to give repeat business.  We found them at RC Wiley in Henderson.
It's to bad because they are really good. They do have competition in Vegas with another corn dig truck.  That has were they are every day on there website, Facebook, yelp so hopefully they will also so we can find them.  Corndog if you can find them over 5 stars. Finding them 1 star so I guess 4 stars."}
{"text":"This was definitely by far one of the best corn dogs I've had, and I've been to a lot of food trucks and restaurant and fast food places. THIS DOESNT COMPARE! Soooo yummy and who would've thought honey on the corn dog! In love! Highly recommend!! And Fizz drinks which this truck was outside of, was super good as well! We Will see this guy and his truck again!"}
{"text":"The Corndog Company LV food truck is a welcome addition to the valley. I have been a long time customer of their St George truck and now I can get my corndog fix right here in town. They have been posting up all over but recently I found them at the Food Truck Party near Total Wine in Centennial. The corndogs are huge and fried to perfection and don't forget to tell them to add honey. Ketchup and mustard are usually near the sodas in a cooler by the ordering window. People working the truck are friendly. If you are able to track down this truck then I suggest you give it a try it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"When a business specializes in one single item, they better be damn good at it.  Luckily, the Corndog Company actually makes really good corndogs, available in half and quarter pound sizes. They recommend getting this with a honey drizzle, which I've never heard of but actually offsets the saltiness of the dog nicely without adding to the heaviness of the fried outer shell. Add mustard for some extra contrast. I haven't had a corn dog in ages but the one I had here was not only tasty but surprisingly  light on the oil. Looking forward to seeing them at another community event soon!"}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly the best corn dog. Crispy and unburned, these corn dogs are a perfect snack or meal."}
{"text":"YeeeeS they came to my job ready and on time!!! These are the best corn dogs I've ever had. The breading was lite and crispy. The dog itself is juicy and flavorful. What I also like it that the corn dog batter does not over power the taste of the dog itself. It all goes together so well.

I would have never thought to put honey on a corn dog; What Have I Been Missing!?

The menu is simple so, there's not much to think about besides the size of your dog and how good it's going to taste. 

Next I'll be trying the cheese dog because my co workers are raving about it saying the cheese is delicious.

Thanks for stopping by!

1. Will recommend
2. Will order again"}
{"text":"Alright this place......DEFINITELY has the best corn dogs ever!! The honey drizzle on top pairs so well with the smoky dog in the center! I could eat about 10 of those things! They've been sitting on the corner of Tenaya and Cheyenne for awhile now and I've been telling myself I need to stop and check it out and I'm so happy I finally did!! Yyyuuummm"}
{"text":"Having just come from the Minnesota State Fair, I thought it would be nice to host a party of fellow Minnesotans.  I hired The Corndog Company food truck to provide corndogs and cheese sticks.  I thought that there would be no way these could compare to the State Fair's corndogs.  Was I WRONG!!  These were so much BETTER!!!!  Our 30+ guests agreed that the Corndog Company's corndogs were crisp and tasty.  Even the neighbors came by and later thanked us. The service was beyond terrific and the prices were (don't tell them) way to low.  5 stars plus several more.  My only regret is that they can't come back next week so I can have more.
Hire this food truck!!"}
{"text":"Honey Dog was amazing! Looking forward to coming back! Great service! Come to summerlin!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy The Corndog Company is here in Vegas now! Hubby and I have been fans of this truck for several years. When we are in St George, UT we always look to see where the truck will be. Now we can check their schedule to see where it will be here in Vegas! The Corndog Company LV makes its way all around town. I have been going to the Food Truck Party near Total Wine on Centennial Center and when I noticed on social media that this truck would be there I had to stop by. They had a long line and you need to be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes after ordering because each corndog is hand-dipped to order and fried to perfection. The corndogs come in a couple sizes and range in price from $4-$6. Not every time, but sometimes the truck does have fried cheese sticks and you'll want to try these if they have them when you visit. The fried cheese sticks have the same delicious crispy batter as the regular corndogs, but are filled with either pepper jack or american cheeses. The corndogs themselves are really tasty. I always order mine with honey and suggest you do also. The honey is drizzled on after the corndog comes out of the fryer. I also add ketchup and mustard that's usually in coolers right outside the truck and you can add as much as you want. The people working the truck are very friendly. This truck is worth checking out and you can see their schedule on social media and sometimes they have daily specials posted there also."}
{"text":"Simple menu...best to be kept like that. Dog is perfect, not getting a ton of batter with a small dog. And never tried it before, but you are a fool to not try it with the honey drizzle."}
{"text":"Absolutely great! Light and crispy batter, that doesn't feel heavy. The batter doesn't take away the flavor from the dog. The cheese bombs are so delicious, I definitely recommend them! Definitely get the corn dog and the cheese bombs with the honey!"}
{"text":"Finally tried them. Not bad.

The Corndog Company is a food truck originally from Utah. They appear to have migrated to / launched in the Las Vegas area two separate trucks, judging by overlapping schedules which I've seen on social media. I tried to visit them unsuccessfully a few months back when they posted up at a master plan community in Henderson but reported an imprecise location and then proceeded to close up shop early by at least an hour. This put me off so much that I waited until they were so close to my place of work that I couldn't ignore them.

That opportunity was at the grand opening of Fiiz Drinks in Henderson. They reportedly parked their truck right outside there from noon-8pm, and I caught them in the second half of that shift.

The menu was very simple: classic size corn dogs for $4, and a larger variety which I think they called \"epic\" for $6. I went for the waist-friendly option and agreed to the honey drizzle, which Christie L had mentioned as a must. The honey is a surprisingly novel concept that adds a touch of sweetness without going overboard. The sausage is probably premade, but they fried the freshly dipped batter to crispy, golden-brown perfection. Ketchup and mustard are on hand too in typical squeeze bottles, and the mustard will help more.

I liked the gimmick and the execution a lot, but couldn't find myself enchanted enough to get anywhere near the 5th star. There needs to be a little more pizzazz or variation than just adding one more ingredient to something that's inherently such a simple concept.

That said, I'll likely grab more corn dogs - pardon me, honey dogs - from The Corndog Company if they keep setting up shop at ultra-convenient spots. They're worth a try if you like corn dogs or if you're still into the food truck hunt thing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best  corndog Ever! The honey just intensifies the batter and with the cheese bombs....epic."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome drove all the way from LA just to try it , and they didn't disappoint,I don't know which one is better the food or the service. They even made my wife a birthday treat.  Thx guys"}
{"text":"I am addicted! I luckily stumbled onto this yummy food truck and now am checking their calendar regularly to see where they are in town. Seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing corndog, loved the honey drizzle. I stopped on a whim and brought 2 home. Hubby wanted me to go get more haha. Next time love."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I randomly found them one day and have been searching for them ever since. Can't wait to randomly find them again some day!"}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time during First Friday and I loved them! It seems that they are a regular at this event because every time I go, they are there. It is worth noting that one corndog feeds one person or more....they are big! I really liked it with the honey drizzle...it pairs very well with the saltines. I even put some ketchup and mustard on mine...yum. 

I also appreciated that even though there was a long line, the wait was very short. They are very good at preparing and handling the food quickly. 

This is a place that if I see again at a food truck event I would stop by and get some. I prefer to have someone else to share the goodness with because of the size, but I don't mind eating it alone."}
{"text":"The best corn dogs ever. I all so love how community friendly they are.  If you see their truck park on the side of the road make a uturn or at your local school's event  get in the long line cause it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"These are so darn tasty and the corndog fella was so nice!! Recommend getting the honey drizzle!!"}
{"text":"I just hit this truck up by Home Depot because my kids have seen it around in our area. The guys working the window were really cool and friendly. I got a couple of corndogs and 2 cheese bombs, one cheddar and one pepper jack. Everything was done in a few minutes and we took it home to eat. The corndogs were drizzled with honey which was fantastic. They were hot and crispy on the outside and the dog itself was delicious, not your cheap hotdogs. The cheese bombs were also amazing. Same with the outside, hot and crispy, drizzled with honey. The pepper jack was our favorite. Cool concept and friendly crew. We would totally hit them up again if we see them around. Good job Corndog Co."}
{"text":"These are some yummy Corndogs!! If you have a chance stop by and try one. I promise you won't be disappointed.  
The young lady working was so awesome; she explained everything and was super friendly.   
Everything looks really clean"}
{"text":"Truly the best corndog ever. Even better than the ones at disneyland. I ate it so fast that i forgot to take a picture. Haha"}
