{"text":"They've got some good menu items to choose from, and the service is generally very friendly.   I typically get their General Chicken, which comes with two sides. I believe that with a beverage this comes out to $8 and some change, which is on par with other food court offerings at Beachwood Place.   One thing that I would like to see, though, is for them to list all of their items on a menu board, instead of having to look down the counter to see what they have."}
{"text":"Beware the bait and switch pricing tactics.  Located on the low rent side of the Beachwood Mall food court, Asian Chao offers a subpar take on the Food Court Chinese genre.   Portions are small and the Orange Chicken was dry from having sat in the warming tray too long.  As for the bait and switch, I ordered the daily special, which was \"2 items for 5.99\". When I got to the register, they charged me 6.99 and said I had received a \"full order\" of chicken and didn't qualify for the special. I argued, but they wouldn't relent.  Now, they can enjoy a \"full order\" of the loss of my patronage. A more apt title would have been Asian Ciao.  (And lest anyone think I'm just unlucky, i heard a family seated next to me complaining of an identical price switch on their order.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the three entree combo with fried rice and a fountain drink. It was all delicious. I tried the orange chicken, crab rangoon, and Kung pao chicken as my entrees. The crab Rangoon and orange chicken particularly stood out. I'm really glad I ate here."}
{"text":"It's an Asian Chao.  If you're expecting a lot then you're at the wrong place.  Overall, it was clean, the staff are friendly and the food was hot and yummy.  Definitely did it's job in my fight against hunger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last Friday and I was surprised there weren't more restaurants in the mall food court.  I went ahead and tried the Orange Chicken with noodles and vegetables.  It was a pretty decent portion, enough to fill me up, but it wasn't like other food court Chinese dives I've been to in terms of quantity.  At other places, I have received two pounds of food that I couldn't finish.  I appreciate the thoughtfulness, however.  I don't need to gorge myself by allowing my eyes to be bigger than my stomach and eating everything in sight.  Most Americans eat whatever is in front of them and that's a huge problem!  Anyway, I doubt that I'll make the trip back tot his food court due to the lack of selection and this Chinese food being just average.  It cost $8.00 for the meal, whereas I can get the same for $5.00 at other malls, plus more food."}
{"text":"Bourbon chicken from Asian Chao is the dish by which all other culinary items are compared. Food of the gods for $6."}
