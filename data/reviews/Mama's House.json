{"text":"This place is legit. 

Since I'm a big fan of drinking way too much on the weekends, I'm a big fan of Mama's. Not only is it a Raiders bar, but its also a babe layer.

All the waitress' are super cool and always help.

The food is bomb too. The chicken fingers don't taste like someone stomped them out with muddy work boots out in the parking lot before they were served. 

Get your drink on and your grub on at this place. If you are expecting it to be a 5 star restaurant like Red Lobster, don't even bother driving your mini van with a huge dent in the side of it to Mama's. Go to taco bell."}
{"text":"Can only be described as a run-down Italian sport bar. 
Food is bad (pasta evidently cooked and rewarmed, but only after some drying - think of old pasta you might have forgotten in your refrigerator). 
Service unimpressive: No utensils nor napkins when the food arrived; Order tea and she brings you raspberry tea without warning -- All that by a \"mature\" woman dressed in a black version of a Hooter's girl uniform: Grandma in hot pants - no, thank you!  
Then double-check your bill: My Alfredo Chicken Pasta were billed $10 (+$2 for the chicken) while the menu showed $8+$2. After a couple of arguing back and forth I got the price adjusted with the explanation that there was a printing error on the menu - no apologies of course. 
I won't be back.
UPDATE: Watch you credit card statement. If you tip too low because you're not satisfied, they will adjust the credit card charge upward for you!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online thru Living Social. For a free $10 credit, why the heck not!
Tried the BBQ burger with a side salad and fish/chips. I sampled both--not too shabby,
They forgot half the order and the place was empty upon food pickup. Not even an offer of a free drink to go for forgetting the other half of the food.
Overall, not overly impressed, but not a bad alternative.
This location has been about four other things in the past five years. Looks like they have a bunch of random happenings during the week--poker, pool tournaments, and trivia. Lots of tv's--all tuned to football. Also included are some pretty good drink specials."}
{"text":"Three strikes -you're out! Went for lunch and had to go into the kitchen and find someone to wait on us. We asked them to hurry even though we were the only table there. 90 minutes for lunch.

Went to UFC fight a few weeks ago. Other than Sean the bartender the rest of the staff thinks they are celibrities and only talk to customers who compliment them and think they are going home with them

Strike three was Staurday when we went in for Anderson Silva UFC fight. Plenty of tables open but had reserved signs on them. Hostess said she reserves them for her guest who aren't there yet? We stand around and wait and a couple leave and we take there table. It is so hot its stiffling. Were sitting next to a group who tells us it is 87 degrees and climbing as the crowds start coming in.  We should have left.  

Our server wearing a silver headband came without menus and asked for drink order. She had no knowledge of what was on tap and never found out for us. We ordered two 25oz beers and they arrived in just under 20 minutes. Without menus she insisted we get our food order in???  She brought us menus and 30 seconds later wanted a food order. We told her we were going to be there for four hours and would order when we had time to discuss it. Yep 30 seconds later she was back. Those saying the pizza here is great have got to be family of the owner, I am not sure the cheese was real cheese.  It might have been 60 minutes before we saw our server again. She was a mess and running around like she forgot where she was at. We knew it would get crazy at the end of the fights so we ask for our check. Over an hour to get the check. We watched people come in and order food and then just get it to go as they were too busy wiping the sweat off of themselves. 

What a whacked out place and I am not sure they will make it. If they want to try they need to have a quick staff training class and let them know they are not the show!"}
{"text":"***** Drove by on 1/4/2013 and now the place is called \"Spur Saloon\" - Looks like the same -owners. It's been 3 different bars in about 3 years now."}
{"text":"This place sucked and I'm not surprised it has been shut down. I had only been there one time but it was such a horrible experience. I ordered a margarita. When I received my drink there was a bug in it! I told the server and she took the drink. I was given a new drink and the server says, 'hopefully there's no bugs in this one'. She didn't say sorry or comp the drink or anything. She was so rude and unprofessional that I never went back. I'm not trying to drink a buggy margarita!"}
