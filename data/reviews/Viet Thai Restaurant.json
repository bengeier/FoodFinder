{"text":"This place used to be a very nice HK style chain restaurant and coffee shop years ago called Dickens. Viet Thai kept the decor and furniture and used it as theirs. The restaurant is never packed and you can always find a table.  Their Thai style hot pho is very yummy.  Overall I wouldn't say they are 100% authentic Vietnamese but most food were made to my satisfaction.  They have take out service but I tried it couple times and it's just not the same compared to having it at the restaurant.  The place could have been cleaner though and they close fairly early probably due to the lack of traffic."}
{"text":"good pho noodles and decently priced"}
{"text":"I had lunch here a few years ago and I remember the food being excellent. I recently came here again for their fruit shake and bubble tea and it was great. The staff were friendly and the dining area was well kept. I will come back again next time I crave Viet food.  

They close at 9:30pm."}
{"text":"Pho is very good. Many other good dishes 
As well but portions could be more generous. Wide variety of teas and smoothies available. Staff is friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"This place opens at 11:00am I got there at 11:15 and the doors where still locked.
So I went for a short walk and came back. As soon as I entered a Lady yelled and said how can I help you !!  I said are you open for lunch they said yes . and showed me to a table. The waitress said you are early ?? Not sure what she means by that if they open at 11am LOL
I odered Laksa after reading some the the reviews.
The bean sprouts were old grey looking the Laksa was not that great very pain tasting
Not sure what others see in this place. I will not return.
I hope the owners go on Yelp and read some of the reviews"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, I realized that the English name and menu has changed to 'Ben Thanh', which is a franchise name, though I think it's still run by the same people. 

Anyhow it was a relatively quiet day even for a weekend. I didn't get a chance to try their pho as it was a pretty hot day, so I ordered the grilled pork chop/lemongrass chicken rice and also the vermicelli. The pork chop was quite good, the lemongrass chicken appeared a little bit on the small side. For some reason, I needed quite a bit of sauce, perhaps the food could be a bit more flavorful?

Prices were average but nothing about the food nor price really stood out for me. I think I'll stick to places like Pho Dau Bo near Creditview or the one on Dundas if I'm in Mississauga. That being said, this isn't a bad option if you're in the area and really craving some Viet food."}
{"text":"Good Pad Thai, horrible Pho. Pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants within Mississauga. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend really like eating out Asian cuisine. This place by far is the best in the city. 

The service is really good. The people that work there are super friendly and tentative to your needs and requests. They are always smiling and look happy which is comforting because alot of restaurants that are \"self serve\" the staff is usually unhappy looking. 

the atmosphere is awesome because the Restaurant is so large and there are many tables and you can sit where ever you want. 

Food: When you order and appetizer you get it before your main meal. Many Asian places scatter the dishes out. We always get our main plates at the same time which is awesome. I would suggest, 100%, RED THIA CURRY!!! I was never a curry person unless it was Caribbean, but this place change my mind. Its absolutely to die for, even if you dont like curry. The pad Thia is amazing also. I had pad Thia previous to eating here and hated it. I tried it here and never looked back, now i love it and eat it all the time. Our goal is to try as many dishes from this place as possible but im sure they will never fail is offering superb taste!! 

Grade A++"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 4 years now , 
It's definitely one of my fave viet pho places in the city .
I'll admit the last few times I was a bit disappointed 
Maybe the have a be new chef or they were just tired.
But I still love the place . They have amazing curry soup and many great pho choices ..Also there cyclone rolls are the bomb !"}
{"text":"Food is good. Ordered a small serving soup, the portion is really good and the soup is tasty. Alot of mea in both dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"To me, this place is close to 4 **** but it lacks the consistency that makes this place my 'go to' Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga.  

Compared to most Vietnamese places in GTA West, this is definitely one of the better restaurants but in the grander scheme of things, meat quality and the service is up and down.  On a good day, I'll sit down and the service is lightning fast with great juicy braised stewed meat in their hot chilli Malay/satay soup.  A juicy freshly pureed mango smoothie comes literally a minute later.  The soup would be bubbling hot and the spices are balanced and the chilli heat is just enough to provide a bold hit.  The beef would be meltingly soft and you can use a spoon to cut the large chunks in half.  I also love the sweet large chunks of carrots and potato you get in the soup too.  For pho, the ridiculously large serving of soup and noodles is really overwhelming and great for those who just crave the carby soupy goodness.

On a bad day, you wait and wait for the cheque to come.  Or the pho beef is more stringy with tendons or the braised beef is more fat than meat.  The flavour of the soups are always great though!! They're not watery and they do not have a huge MSG hit either.

The prices here are very reasonable.  It's easy to get a smoothie and meal for under $10.  It's too bad the quality is up and down or I'd say this is a great place for Vietnamese in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for almost 12 years now!
It helps that I live just around the corner....

It serves one of the best pho in the city.
My current favorite is #109 large.
If the staff read this review they might know who I am ! LOL!

For pho, it's all about the soup stock, as all the other ingredients are similar. The VT stock is so tasty that I rarely leave a drop behind at the end of my meal. The serving size is generous as well.

My wife's favorite is the curry laksa. Whilst it's not like the laksa that we get in Singapore, she loves it as a reasonable substitute.

My kids love the crispy fried chicken wings which are large!
We also like the 'yao tiew' or fried dough sticks which are freshly made or should I saw freshly fried...

BTW, it's closed on Tuesdays....like I found out once too many times when I drove out for a quick bite to be disappointed that it was a Tuesday again..."}
