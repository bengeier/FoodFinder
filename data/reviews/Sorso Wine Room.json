{"text":"Great wine selection! 32 different wine to choose from with a sip, taste or a pour. You choose!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Fun! Fabulous service! Food was delicious and the wine wall was delightful. Will definitely recommend to my Concierge Team to promote!"}
{"text":"So many wine bar \"bistros\" blast their music like a hipster club, not so at Sorso Wine Room. The decor/seating is minimalistic and contemporary, but not the least bit cheap or stuffy. Service here is excellent, and the waitress I had was courteous to all questions presented by my girlfriend and myself. We ordered several varieties of bruschetta, and mostly all of them far exceeded our expectations in quality; however, the ham one is reprehensibly salty, which was a bit of a let down. 

Overall, the price-per-quality ratio is amazing here, and you can be sure to enjoy your dining experience and come back for more."}
{"text":"Tried out Sorso on my lunch break... ordered 2 pieces of bruschetta - Gorgonzola with seasonal fruit - (thinly sliced fresh nectarines) and the Roasted tomato and Avocado.  Both were delicious.  Also ordered the Hummus platter - came with a beautiful assortment of fresh veggies, including watermelon radish, which I don't see everyday.... that was good too.  My only complaint on that though would be the hummus was VERY heavy on garlic in my opinion.  Some people like that I realize, but for myself personally it was overpowering for my taste.

Service was excellent, being that it was my first time, the server explained the menu to me and made recommendations.  I LOVE the concept of the wine towers - you can serve yourself with a prepaid card - over 130 wines available to taste and try.  I will definitely be back for a happy hour soon!"}
{"text":"We went Friday night at Sorso for some wine  and appetizers. It was crowded  (as it should be a Friday at 6.30pm) so we had a little bit of wait. But i can tell you that worth it. The charcuterie (and cheese) platter was yummy. Where do they find this charcuterie ? I want to be able to buy some !!! The brushettas oh la la ! And thanks to my dear husband he choose the perfect wine .
Oh I almost forgot ! The service was nice..."}
{"text":"I love this place. The concept is awesome and really a lot of fun. It's a great way to try a bunch of different wines."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and each time it gets better and better! The staff is super friendly and knowledgable about their wines. They have such a great selection of wines and craft beers on tap! It has an awesome atmosphere and good food. I will keep going back and recommend it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The decor had a cool, industrial feel to it. We were seated quickly and the host was helpful and informative. The food was good, but perhaps a little on the salty side. My problem was with our server, who goofed up my order, at two separate points, with an insincere sounding \"sorry\". The service was also extremely slow. I wouldn't have so much minded a slightly longer wait for the meal while I enjoyed my wine, but having my wine order ignored, at a wine bar, was unforgivable."}
{"text":"Sorso is the best wine bar around and Josh is one of the best servers I know! I highly recommend this stop at the Scottsdale Quarter!"}
{"text":"Let me just say, this place has the best staff, amazing wine selection, and the atmosphere can't be beat! We were lucky enough to have josh as our sever. He was incredibly friendly, professional, and attentive to our needs. I don't know much about wine, but we told him what we like, asked his opinion, and his suggestion was perfect! He made sure to check on us frequently, but didn't interrupt us every 10 seconds. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice relaxing atmosphere, great wine, yummy treats, and friendly staff! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sorso five times in the short time it has been open for both lunch and dinner. What keeps me coming back? Food, atmosphere, wine selection, service and location. The food is unique, of the highest quality and priced really well. Fine, imported Italian meats, artisan cheeses, seasonal salads, hummus, and bruschetta that is nothing like I've seen before. Atmosphere is urban, casual with a open floor plan and ample outdoor seating. The wine selection is outstanding. My favorite by the glass is Manifesto a medium bodied Cabernet. They offer 32 bottles in their wine dispensing machines. My favorite from the dispenser is Broquel, a very well priced and smooth Malbec. The service is attentive and friendly. Location is in the heart of Scottsdale Quarter. Can't wait to come back again and again! This place is a 10!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem in the Scottsdale Quarter. The service was excellent, the prices were very reasonable, and the atmosphere was inviting. This is my wife and I's new favorite place to go in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went to Sorso last night for happy hour with 5 other gals from the office and everybody had a great time. The service was slow but the waitress was friendly, remembered our orders perfectly, and otherwise did a great job. The varieties of bruschetta we tried were delicious! I'd only suggest less honey on the gorgonzola, honey and fruit type--or a less-sweet fruit than grapes--because it was just too sweet. Good time and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Whether you are looking for a girls night out or a place to have a business lunch meeting at Sorso has it covered. Great staff, wonderful atmosphere and many tasty menu items to choose from. Also loved their market area where I could pick up some wines and gifts to go. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, energy and service. 
Oh and the wine?  Spectacular.   Haven't had food but will be back!!"}
{"text":"Fun!  Nice wine selections, great atmosphere, repurposed decor has a cool vibe, very comfortable and awesome bruschetta. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. We had a great time and will definitely go back.  Thanks, Sorso!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection, best bruschetta in the valley and awesome staff!  Great happy hour. Best of all Joey and the crew make you feel welcome and special. Definitely our favorite regular gathering place for girls night out."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and amazing food menu. Friendly staff and cool vibe with the decor. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We just stopped in for an evening glass of wine and the selection was brilliant. The waitress was so helpful in picking our wines and totally on point. Loved the vibe. They also sell wine to go - bonus!"}
{"text":"New to the Scottsdale Quarter this wine bar does not disappoint. Don't come here expecting to have an extensive menu unless that menu is for wine. Although the bruschetta has something for everyone and is pure deliciousness, you come here for the wine, the energy and great people who work here. From the time we walked in great experience. Don't be afraid of pricing there is something for everyone. Even the high end pours are priced right. Get here and experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"Love Sorso Wine Room.  The perfect place to relax and enjoy a nibble.  Beautiful decor.  Friendly service.  Good prices.  Just a lovely place to be.  I'm so happy I found this little treasure."}
{"text":"Love this place and I go every time that I am in town.. I would be cautious of Ansley W's review since it's an exaggeration. I was in Sorso during this \"event\" and it didn't happen like she is recalling.. but there is no need to get into a she said he said, I just don't think someone should slam a great small business because they caused a scene and didn't get away with it. 
I have met the owners multiple times and they have been amazing, honestly sometimes I go back just to chat with them.
If you're in the area love wine and some light bites I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"There are not enough nice things to say about this wine room, the atmosphere, the staff, the food, and of course the amazing wine selection. I have never had something there I do not like. The flavors & presentation of the food are perfect. The wine list is one of the best I've ever seen. Anytime I get the chance to go I consider myself lucky to have such an amazing experience. Such an amazing & unique place that the Scottsdale Quarter is lucky to have!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and there are few patrons...and I'm wondering why; lucky for me!
This place is fabulous from the urban decor to the open-air views to the groovy music (perhaps a Sunday vibe).
The wine selection is ample with tastes for every pallet (every appreciative pallet that is), and the info provided by the \"non\" sommelier was thankfully void of that pretentious \"essence of roster with a hint of blackberry-charcoal\".
And the food...!!! Are you kidding me? If the bruschetta is any indication of the depth of flavors in the rest of the menu, by all means...don't miss out! Roasted tomato, well balanced balsamic, and fresh basil was just one of the slices of heaven enjoyed.
Ok...I'm rambling...
Try Sorso. You deserve it!"}
{"text":"Well its hard to comment on the food or drinks when left 30 seconds into it. The hostess seated us and then told us that we would have to move in an hour because there was a reservation for the table that she just seated us at. Then she turned and waked away. We were taken back by her rudeness. So we walked out. The hostess followed me out and asked why were not staying,  so I told her that she was rude. She said sorry and waked away. Terrible and arrogant!

There are so many other options in the area, so we will never go back."}
{"text":"Every experience I have had a Sorso Room has surpassed my expectations! The bruschetta is phenomenal, extremely fresh, and the portions are huge! The first time I was there, we ordered a bottle of wine and not only did the waiter recommend another wine he thought we would like better, which we ended up loving and order everytime we go now, but it was also cheaper! The service is outstanding and they allowed us to purchase the centerpiece at the table! Very excited to now be apart of the wine club - which is a great concept, where you are able to try an assortment of wines at different serving sizes!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Selection is very good, but some of the wines have too much of a markup for selfserve. Silver Oak (Alexander valley) goes for over $100 bottle at the selfserve machine.  Its available at Costco for less than $60.

Other than pricing, decor is nice and staff are friendly/knowledgeable.  Place Has a nice vibe. We will come back again."}
{"text":"We came on Saturday night around 8 PM. The place was fairly crowded. We had a few beers and sandwiches. The service was horrible. No one came to check on us during our meal. We must have waited 5 minutes to get a second beer. Then waited and waited to get our bill. The food was alright. The beer was good. The service was not good. The couple seated in the table next to ours finally handed the waitress their credit card without getting their bill just so they could leave! They must have felt the service was lacking too!"}
{"text":"Crazy busy place - always. But the selection is good and the staff is nice. They do a good job explaining how the machines work and how you are charged. Appetizers are good but over priced. Seating is verrrrrrryyyyy UNcomfortable. Most especially the bar stools. That place is NOT made for you to hang out long. They want you in and out for the turn around in crowds waiting. Thats a shame because I think I would hang out there a lot more often and stay longer to spend more on wine & food with my friends if all that were changed. But for now, we just use that place to meet up and then move on to another restaurant or hit a movie."}
{"text":"This restaurant comes off as a spitting image of Postinos across the street. I enjoyed the wine and food I had here, but it was nothing special. It defiantly doesn't measure up to Postinos so close by!"}
{"text":"Wonderful venue, excellent wine selections, great food!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to Sorso Wine Room for my birthday (a Friday), planning on getting a couple bruschettas and some wine during happy hour before heading to iPic to catch a movie, where we planned on ordering dinner. Upon arriving, we were the only people in line and it took about 5 minutes for us to be sat. We weren't sure what to think at that point, since that wasn't a great first impression, but it would wind up getting better from there. After seating, we ordered a glass of wine each, and perused the menu. A few minutes later, the waiter came over to us with a board full of bruschetta and asked if we were interested in them. We were a little confused, wondering if he was offering a taste or something else. Then he told us he had it made for another table, but that table needed it made with gluten-free bread and this set hadn't been. At that point, we accepted as one of the two flavors was one we were going to order anyways, and we were hungry. We didn't want to take advantage, so we also ordered two more bruschettas. The bruschetta was bigger than we were expecting, as a similar restaurant we previously visited had smaller portion sizes. While I didn't find the bread to be anything special, the toppings were very tasty and fresh, and the flavor combinations went together well. After our meal, we were satisfied and wound up not ordering dinner at the movie theater. It wound up being a very pleasant meal and I received a great 29th birthday gift in the form of free bruschetta. :)

The free bruschettas:
Gorgonzola, Honey, Seasonal Fruit: This was not one we would have ordered on our own, but it was better than anticipated. Our seasonal fruit was green apples, and they lent a nice crispness and acidity to the sweetness of the honey
Goat Cheese, Olive Tapenade: My hubby doesn't typically like goat cheese, but this one was less pungent than others he's had, and the olive tapenade provided subtle saltiness to balance with the goat cheese. 

What we ordered:
Sun Dried Tomato Pesto, Arugula: This one is piled high with arugula, maybe a little too much, as the tomato pesto got kind of lost in the leaves. When you could taste the pesto though, it was very good with a hint of sweetness.
Serrano Ham, Avocado, Tomato, Manchego: This was both of our favorites. All the flavors went together really well, with everything balanced and nothing too overpowering."}
{"text":"Had the best time!! Our server Gareth was great! Appreciated how he explained the menu, wines & his favorites. Love the idea of taste, sip or pour, to try wines i haven't had before. Came here for a girls night out. UH.MAY.ZING bruschetta & we all had the champagne flights. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Relocated to Scottsdale and walked in on a Tuesday.  Tara who's service and recommendations were just outstanding.  She focus on the customer and was more than happy to share all the great options Sorso had to offer.  Food and wine options were awesome.  Slight complaint is that the bottle of wine could have been a bit cooler.  Not enough to take away a star.  I'm coming back for the great service, tasty food and fantastic specials.  Love the music!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great concept if you like to taste many good to great wines to find new ones you might like. You get an ipad with a list of the wines they have that day and you can drill down to a great description of each wine.  Some of the wines may be served at your table and some are in a wine rack that you can self serve.  All can be served in quarter, half or full portions at quarter, half or full price so you can go quarter to quarter to quarter through say 8 wines and only have two full glasses.  The cost for 4 quarters is no more than the full glass so it's a deal.  And the variety of wines is really great, including wines from the north eastern Italian grape Garganega that makes a terrific white that you don't find often. They had a nice Malbec and others along with some high end Cab's to taste. You can save the ones you like and email the list to yourself for later.  Along with the wines there is a list of food.  I was so busy with the wine's I didn't pay much attention to the food other than the meat, cheese, bread and olive board which was delicious.  The menu is all very light but a board and a salad would certainly make a lunch or light dinner.  I'll be back here many times."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great wine selection, and cool atmosphere! The staff was friendly and we received the best service! We'll definitely be back for round 2! Thumbs up for Sorso!"}
{"text":"This place has a very good wine list and we love the atmosphere! The service is always stellar and of course the area is great for shopping so this makes a perfect choice for a good meal after bumming around all day.

The menu is fun and there is a lot of great sounding stuff to pick from. Unfortunately, the food is only good and not great. They have some great ideas but the execution falls short of the 5 star mark, though still very enjoyable. Some are a touch bland or missing components that could tie the entire dish together. Again, still good but not quite to the 5 star level. As compared to Postino's, Postino's dishes are better in my opinion.

We will still be back though for sure and hope to see how the new menu items come out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing service and super friendly!  I forget my servers name he was young and cute though and patient considering I moved from bar to table and back to bar because I hate the chairs that are outside.  I sat at the bar with my husband and we got the bread bowl, amazing super gooey flavorful cheese. 
   The wine selection is great there is something for everyone and it is self serve.  I love the option of getting to pick if I want a big or little taste or a full glass.  My favorite was a gruner super tasty and bright."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with my girlfriend. Had the Brussels board and The Dip. Yummy! The wine was two for one per person. We didn't think we could drink two but then, magically we did! Great service and nice location. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun little spot! Popped in recently while waiting for our table at True Food. We ordered a nice bottle of pinot and the shishito pepper appetizer. Service was prompt, wine was enjoyable, and the peppers were tasty. A little overpriced, but we've found that's how things go at the Q; high rent = high prices. Either way, we will return to try out more wines and maybe some charcuterie (it looked delicious!)."}
{"text":"I loved Sorso!!!!  Delicious bruschetta, great wine selection, super cool decor/atmosphere!  What a great addition to the Quarter!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love Sorso!!  Yummy bruschetta :D  Our server is usually Scotty who is great and always takes good care of us!"}
{"text":"SOLID 5 stars. From the minute we walked in, the staff made us feel welcome. Happy hour is a great deal on wine, with great choices. The dispensary for wine is fun and has some really good wines. The bruschetta which was also on happy hour was very good. Troy the manager was so friendly and helpful, and our bartender was the best!!  Best food, best wine, and best people!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Doh! I forgot to get pictures! That's because I was enjoying myself so much that I got distracted!! The idea of being able to try different wines from the wine wall was pretty cool and I tried a lot of really good wines. I also like that they serve their red wine at the correct temperature (room temperature does not mean 80 degrees, in the old days wine cellars were kept underground at \"room temperature\" which is closer to 60 degrees). 

Anyways, the food was tasty, had a number of different bruschettas, the nut sack, Charcuterie board and the Brussel board. We devoured it all!

Our server was Tara and she was great! Very attentive, made sure everyone had what they needed and took the time to explain the wine wall and provided a fabulous experience. 

The last star would have been given if it hadn't taken almost an hour for the bruschetta to come out, good thing we were distracted with wine"}
{"text":"From LA and when I went to Scottsdale recently, we went to Sorso. Was with my wife and another couple. Couldn't have had a better night! The staff was extremely helpful and enjoyable. The food is really good and reasonably priced. The wine selection is awesome and what a unique and fun experience. LA needs a Sorso, we love it there and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Super cool wine bar!  32 wines on tap!  You get a card that you insert into the wine dispenser that tracks what you get and adds it to your bill. You can choose a taste, half glass, or full glass. We created our own charcuterie board and it was delicious. Cool atmosphere and pleasant staff. The parking garage is next door. We will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than this! What a Fantastic Concept!! 

Wanna go to Napa, CA for a wine tasting tour for just the day!?!?!! Screw the plane fare and just head on over to this lil' gem!!

From the moment we walked in KATIE, the hostess, gave us her time, to talk to us about how the wine tasting works! She was the sweetest person to talk to and honestly, one of the reasons why we came back, after some great shopping! She was incredibly accommodating for a group of four!.... 

As I walked in, I noticed that there was such a \"cool and excited vibe\" in the air! Lot's of people with wine glasses in their hands, standing around....smiling and chattering!

JASON, our, I don't want to say \"server\" because he was SO MUCH MORE than that, made our first time experience there, one of the BEST we've had! We appreciate the art of food and wine and have enjoyed many \"5 star, Michelin, blah, blah...\" places... yes, we like to go out and enjoy!

Knowledge along with fantastic recommendations from, JASON was spot on! We had a blast and left knowing that we had AWESOME sips of different wines, fresh, off the WALL food and were DEFINITELY coming back! 
DO I RECOMMEND THIS sweet place to enjoy a bunch of different wines and delicious, fresh, Bruschetta, the picolo and the caprese salad!??!!?? YES! YES! YES! and what a great place to get to meet tons of people, all enjoying \"those awesome wine machine-thingggggyyysss\" (quoted from a group that was just as excited as we were)

 I'm telling ya, it's like going to Napa, CA and being able to enjoy a wine tasting, in one place!!

Kudos to the management for creating such an awesome team!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to enjoy a glass of wine.  Bruschettas are amazing. Great neighborhood wine bar"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food, wine and atmosphere are great and reasonably priced. You can choose from so many different wines! Oh Ya, the desserts are amazing!! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to figure out why the service was so bad on a slow Wednesday night and who thought it was a good idea to serve pimento loaf on a charcuterie board. 

The \"pour your own wine\" concept was a little odd. This atmosphere was anything but fun. Next time I'm wanting wine we will go to the Whining Pig or somewhere less pretentious with better service and no pimento loaf."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to have a glass of wine along with something to eat but all of the other venues were packed since it was Christmas Eve.  

We noticed hardly anyone in the Sorso Wine Room, and that should have been our first clue that this place has extremely poor customer service.

We sat ourselves, the server gave us a couple of waters, and then she never came back.  I had to find someone to take our order.  Never came out to check on us - just laid the bill down.  When I was ready to pay no one took it - I had to find someone to give it to.  

This place is awful and so my suggestion is just stay away."}
{"text":"Great specials on Monday night for viewings of The Batchelor. Wonderful labeled wine and amazing bruschetta. My personal favorite was the gorgonzola and the mozzarella. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"What a neat place.  My wife and I popped in here for some after-dinner drinks and were very impressed.  Great wine selection, extensive craft beer selection.  We didn't try the food so I can't speak to that, but we probably will come back to soon.  Nice ambiance and decor, personable and helpful bartender as well.  We were impressed!"}
{"text":"We did the wine & food pairing tonight. Great company, had so much fun & Tara kicked ass."}
{"text":"Great place for any occasion from a date night, quick drink or just a girls night out. This place is so cute and has a great location not to mention the yummy food! If you have not checked Sorso out you need to!"}
{"text":"I love their wine wall. So much fun to use the ipad to read about the wines an then get to try them out. The food was amazing. I highly suggest making your own flatbread and getting the sundried tomato pesto as your sauce. So so good. Matthew was attentive and helpful. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great new Wine Room!  Great selection of everyday wines and those for that special occasion. Tara was very attentive making sure I knew how to use the dispensers and checked in periodically. The Piccolo was perfect snack size and tasty. Definitely check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I personally love this place. Cute/small atmosphere! Their artichoke dip and bruschetta board is delicious. The service is friendly and very knowledgeable about their food/wine. It does get extremely packed in the restaurant. 

The only downfall to this place is that it is a small restaurant and you want to come before 5:30 since it gets packed fast."}
{"text":"Sorso Is amazing. They have a great wine selection and the staff is really knowledgable. The bartender David was awesome and the manager Shannon was super helpful when it came to wine selection. I went with my co worker after work and it was a great place to unwind."}
{"text":"Still loving SORSO!  Sunday and half price wine bottles... AMAZING!   Only thing was... Sunday felt like the B-Team.  Just a little disorganized and slow.  Still a really fun place.  Oh and the live music was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great bruschetta, awesome wine selection and prices, and even good espresso for a late night kick. The server Steve is a bit unorthodox. Gave him a second chance to redeem himself and just felt brushed off. Love sitting in Matt's section when he's there. Spunky younger guy with a great attitude and really makes sure everything is great. Would give five stars except the bruschetta of the moment was the same for over three weeks (and the flavor was awful) and their happy hour specials are pathetic."}
{"text":"Ryan makes the Sorso wine experience exceptional! His wine knowledge is exceptional and I will continue to visit Sorso because of the excellent wine and customer service! Thanks Ryan!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and catching up with friends! I've enjoyed many of the food items and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ya so first off the staff and owners are not only stuck up but they know nothing about wine.thats not the worst. ..i got so sick after eating there and so did my boyfriend. I give this place 2 years tops!!"}
{"text":"I know its a wine bar, but the cider was delicious....as was the gluten free bread and the olive tapenade.  I LOVE this place!  The patio dining was so relaxing, and I really needed that.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were impressed by the wine selection and the menu.  We enjoy trying new spots (at least to us) and we came away impressed with Sorso's commitment to Small plates and Charcuterie. Cool wine list as well.  You can tell they put a lot of thought into their wine selections.

We sat at the bar as is usual and enjoyed speaking with and learning from a very capable Bartender/Waiter names Jay.  He represented both Sorso and himself well.  The \"Grande\" Charcuterie plate was more than enough for my wife and me.  Some people may find it a little \"pricy\" but by Scottsdale standards we found it reasonable.

My only concern was that on a Thursday night after Christmas and a very busy Scottsdale Quarter that Sorso wasn't busier!

Give it a try.  Nice people, a beautifully designed space and really good food......."}
{"text":"Very cool environment, I love the building design itself, and it's open air even when you sit inside. The wines on tap are neat, I had not seen them before this trip.  The wait staff is friendly and willing to make good recommendations.  The wine is good and not overpriced."}
{"text":"Excellent wine and food!  The salmon bruschetta was incredible!  The Tap sandwich was terrific as well.  Our server was Nolan and was very knowledgeable and delightful!  We highly recommend this place!

Sorry, I meant to give 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I did like this place.  Attentive service. I ordered two glasses.  However, I thought I saw something moving and it was two COCKROACHES walking across the bar. Managed to kill just one with one of their flyers.  Asked for the manager to let them know but didn't come (I wasn't looking for a free glass).  I paid,  left a full glass  of wine and left after washing my hands.  GROSS!"}
{"text":"We had a hard time trying to figure out where to grab a bite and bev prior to a movie when this place popped into our mind. Buona fortuna for us! This place was packed and had a trendy, upbeat, fun-loving vibe. There were two seats left at the bar, which would have been fine, but the hostess was resourceful and found a nice two-top tucked in a corner that worked perfectly for us.

I ordered the \"Bubbly flight\" - $15 for four generous sparkling pours which included a Prosecco, Blanc de noir, Lambrusco, and rose. I've never done a 'champagne' flight, and it was a pleasure to sip and sample a variety of bubbles.

My husband opted for the very popular, serve-your-self, wine dispensers. It sounds a little 'less-than-romantic' for a wine bar, but this 'machine' is stocked with 32 bottles of various wines from around the world. You can opt for half or full pours, which allows customers to sample wines without investing in a full pour if they don't want to. My husband tried the Malbec recommended by our waiter and a zin. He preferred the Malbec - and we appreciated the waiter's knowledgeable guidance.

The unsung hero of the evening went to the food. For $15 we had one of the best cheese/charcuterie plates we've ever ordered. Three cheeses, three salamis, olives, fig spread, mustard spread, fresh baked bread, and marconi almonds. It was sizable, beautifully presented, and we were both stuffed (we had planned to order entrees as well - sandwiches or salads is what they offer but there was no need).

This place is clearly great for date nights or group outings. Plenty of intimate tables along with several community tables, as well as a side area for more private group functions. My only regret is discovering this wine room after the holidays - my visiting family members would have loved this place. I'm looking forward to taking them next winter...and sampling their other great wine and food offerings with my local family and friends until then."}
{"text":"This is a really great concept and in nice location. When we first got there it took a while for the hostess to even get us to a table..yet there was quite a few empty ones.. The wines were mediocre and the server didn't have much knowledge of the wines. They have a self serve wine station, yet she couldn't tell me how the bottle are arranged... She said it's just white to red... And then they just switch them around when empty... All of the wines we tried were super bitter and not good. It took the server 10 mins just to get this \"wine card\" to use in the machine, which is linked to a credit card... Then you have to give the \"wine card\" back at the end of the night... What a hassle...just use a credit card to begin with...We tried the wine flight which is only with sparkling wines. It was awful. They don't really let you pick the wines you want to try with the \"wine flight.\" However they will plop a iPad on the table to try more wines they know nothing about... The guys said their beer was just okay. The server couldn't even mention the name of the beer just the type such as IPA... It seems like they have too much going on at this place but not enough knowledge to make it truly a nice experience. I wouldn't say this is a true wine bar.... It was half empty on a Saturday night..."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one simple. Super friendly and welcoming staff and service. Was here from out of town and I would love if MI had a chill spot like this.  It was their 3 year anniversary so we got an awesome deal...buy 2 bruschettas ($10) get 2 free! So perfect and paired well with the wine. Wine on tap (pictured) plus a very wide menu with variety. Salads, apps, build your own grilled cheese, charcuterie boards, sandwiches, bruschetta (was on POINT), entrees. Items we tried and loved (pictured):
Tomato soup: perfectly seasoned and tad bit spicy.
Salami bruschetta 
Serrano ham bruschetta 
Pesto bruschetta 
Roasted Brussels bruschetta 

Can't wait to be back when in AZ!"}
{"text":"So much fun! We reserved the back room for a large party and had a great time! The atmosphere was great and our waiter was very accommodating! Check out the wine dispenser wall, very cool!"}
{"text":"This place is like a constant wine tasting - it's effectively serve-yourself wine with you in the driver's seat in terms of samples, half pours or full pours.  This is an excellent way to try a lot of wine without the commitment of a full glass.  It's super cute inside and would be a fun spot to spend an afternoon snacking and wine sampling.    

My only complaint was that our server disappeared and we were in a small panic to get our checks in order to retrieve our cars from valet before they closed.  Once we tracked her down, it seemed to take a very long time time to run our cards.  Service could use some tweaking."}
{"text":"Great location for date night. This place was packed but luckily two seats at the bar opened up. The manager was gracious enough to explain how the concept worked. 

We were able to try all kinds of wine and ordered a large charcuterie plate (well worth the price) and had enough left over for multiple people. 

Perfect date night, pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Sorso!  I had my most recent Birthday Party there, and I could not have been happier!  I reserved the small area at the back for me and my 16 guests, and it was just perfect, not separated from the rest of the restaurant, yet private enough so that we would not disturb others.  The area was prepared in advance, the food was brought promptly, and glass...after glass...after glass...was delivered with a big smile. (I now have a secret crush on David.) So much deliciousness.  I know, Winos don't use the word, \"Deliciousness,\" but who cares?  Totally dug the contemporary swank design.  And the best part?  I was given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco for celebrating my birthday at Sorso.  I will be back!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner and wine pairing was a blast! As usual the group that attended was awesome and the food and wine was yummy. Thanks to Tara for all of your hard work."}
{"text":"We had beer and bruschetta while sitting at the bar. Ryan, the bartender, was fabulous and made the night fun with Haiku-Tuesday.  He was friendly, attentive, and entertaining. We will be back. 

The backup bar help was friendly and fun to chat with during our visit. The beer was great - Pie-hole porter and a light floral beer that was one of the better ones I've tried. Bruschetta - incredible. The size was generous and we both had enough to bring home for lunch the next day. 

I'm looking forward to our next visit - especially since I will be saving room next time for one of their cupcakes. Scottsdale Quarter location - cozy, great vibe, great view of plaza area."}
{"text":"Great selection of wines and cocktails.
Red velvet ice cream...amazing.
Staff: awesome
GM: more awesome!
Will be back"}
{"text":"Sort of a good concept but horrible service.  The place was 2/3s empty and we were still ignored"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing wine, delicious bruschetta and friendly staff! The tasting options are great for exploring new wines! My new spot!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Sorso wine room. The restaurant is upscale and the outdoor seating is perfect. Located at the Scottsdale Quarter the outdoor patio seating is great for people watching. The wine menu is extensive. Each wine is listed on an iPad that each table is given. We are able to research the wine before ordering it. A great spot for a date"}
{"text":"The food was great and the drinks were great. The overall theme and decor make this a great place. The downside, though, is that whoever owns this place must not be aware that one of their servers, Whitney, made the whole experience very awkward. She was very irritated when we arrived for some reason and made that known when we asked for water. When we asked if there was a drink menu, she said, \"ya I'd get it for you but you so urgently needed water\". Uhh ok? Asking for water seems like a simple request. I won't belabor the rest of the details but, needless to say, we felt more like a burden than a valued patron. If I were the owner, that would be the last impression I wanted my restaurant to make."}
{"text":"Great music, great bruschetta, good happy hour. Only disappointment is the happy hour wines are bar pours and not available at the wine tap dispenser, which we were all anxious to try.  We left not experiencing the signature feature of Sorso. Happy hour model needs a bit of streamlining to be less complex and a more open experience."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. My husband and I split 3 bruschetta and a sandwich. The Americano sandwich was so flavorful...Filling but not too heavy. The food was so fresh and delicious. You can tell they use the best ingredients. We enjoyed the ambiance and feel of Sorso and the wine dispenser system is such a great idea. Such a fun place and fun experience. My husband loved that he could try as many wines as he wanted before having to fully commit to one. Definitely one of our new favorite date night places. The friendly service made our experience such a fun night. We will be coming here to enjoy wine, beer, and food in the near future."}
{"text":"Sorso is an amazing spot for a girl's night out or a date night! The amazing decor and atmosphere, endless amounts of wine tasting with their sip, pour, glass system! Definitely my new fave wine spot!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn about writing this review.  I went with some girlfriends for Happy Hour,  I got there just at the tail end of the HH, so I ordered some of the HH food while I waiting for my friends to arrive.  I ordered the bruschetta, only the last 4 on the list are part of the deal, so I ordered one of each.  Also the Ortagio plate is 1/2 off during HH, so we had that too.  It is a lot a vegetable for the amount of hummus you get.  For the price is not bad.  The bruschetta were good but nothing special.  My favorite were the first two, the one with gorgonzola and sweet fruit and the one with the olive tapenade.  Now the wine list by the glass is really short.  My friends and I decided to try the tasting card.  This is where we had some hiccups.  I thought the idea was fabulous.  I started with my first pour, we opted to get the minimum pour, so we could taste more.  First one was without any issues.  The second one, the server suggested I hit the half pour and that I will be charged only the amount it pours, because it had enough for the 1 1/2 oz pour, but not for the 1/2 glass.  When I hit the button, I got less than the 1 1/2 oz pour.  I called the server immediately, and had him compared the amount to the one my girlfriend had gotten (she got the 1 1/2 pour of another wine), mine was 2/3 of hers and I was being charged a lot more.  I told him I wouldn't mind paying almost $8 had I gotten the amount they claimed I was served.  The manager came over and she offered a $5 credit.  My third taste the same thing happened and I was done with the tasting choice.  I ordered a glass of wine from the wine list.  Then one of my girlfriends tried to get another tasting and the same thing happened to her.  She did get a credit also, but it is a little annoying to have to call the manager and start comparing pours.  The place is nice the food seems ok, but I am not sure I will do the card next time I come."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, awesome service, and amazing food! I went with my friend and our server Caitlin was amazing with informing us with all the specials, their wine tasting, and her service was on point. I should know because I worked in the restaurant industry for many years as a server, bartender and manager and I know great service when I go out to eat. 

I LOVE the fact that there's an iPad on your table to browse through all the food pictures and information of their wines. They have a large wine selection too!

I love the fact that when you walk in, there's such a warm presence and every staff member is so attentive! 

I WILL be back for more and bring more people! A must try and highly recommended. Try their bruschetta's! We have the berry and Brie (yummy), strawberry and Brie ( good but I think feta cheese would have complimented the flavors better but still tasty), ham and pepper (awesome), tomato mozzarella basil (omg so good), apple Brie with honey (always a tasty fav), and their arugula one was good just hard to eat as you can see the leaves fell everywhere lol. Maybe if the leaves we put on under the cheese it would be easier to eat.... there are. Few suggestions but nothing serious that changes my view of this wonderful place!

I highly recommend for all to try! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their wines and sparkling wines are awesome. The ambience is fun and relaxed. Also their different array of plates are delicious, goes grate with the wine. They also have some good beers on tap if you prefer that. I come here regularly and is one of my favorite places. If you have a sweet tooth you definitely have to try one of their cupcakes that come in different flavors. Super chill and relaxed place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend comes here all the time with his friends and raves about it. I came in for the first time tonight with him and absolutely loved it. I have a small knowledge of wine, but I told SCOTTIE exactly what I wanted. He said, \"Yes, I know exactly what you'd want.\" Brought it out and what do you know? Exactly what I wanted. He's a gem and knows great guest service! Plus, the place in general was awesome! 1/2 off bottles of wine on Tuesday's and live music! Great place, loved it!"}
{"text":"I had my first Sorso experience on a Monday evening and the place was packed at 9 p.m. The manager was very friendly and had us sample various wines before choosing which one we wanted to order. The service was impeccable. The wine selection was immaculate. Most importantly, the ambiance was perfect. My company and I didn't eat but we are coming back for their weekend brunch soon to test it out. Five stars."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night after a great tour at Taliesin West.  The atmosphere is laid back and really comfortable, the service was fantastic, the wine selection was vast and reasonably priced and the cupcakes were huge and so amazing - moist and downright delicious!  I only wish Sorso was closer to our place in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambience and friendly attentive staff. I think there are only 3 or 4 of them but they work with such high efficiency. Nolan is so friendly and helpful. Must try their bruschetta. I normally don't like goat cheese but the one I had was damn good! 

Wine dispensary looks pretty neat but didn't get a chance to try it. 

Tip: It gets busy and may takes longer time to get your order after 7pm"}
{"text":"Methinks no is right. Holy shit, it was so bad our huge party of 8 left! If you get seated with Whitney, leave. I repeat, if you get seated with Whitney, leave. She turned our, what was supposed to be an amazing night of celebration. Into a night that left everyone with a sour taste in our mouths and we didn't even eat or drink it was so bad right away! Sad to see a place let 8 girls leave and go spend money else where."}
{"text":"This was such a nice place to have happy hour, typical bottle and board but great people watching at the quarter. The bread was delicious and the bruschetta so good.
We enjoyed it very much and it was a great mix of people and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I really love this spot. Not only is it cozy and slightly off the beaten path in Scottsdale Quarter, but it's chock full of amazing wine options. 

Take a seat and the server will hand you an iPad with a bunch of information about the wine. They will hand you a card linked to your credit or debt card and you help yourself to the wine. You can choose between a taste, half or full pour. It's a great and fun way to taste a variety of wine.

You can always order additional drinks from the full bar or place a speciality wine order - the bubbly from your server. They also serve snacks and cheese plates. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very cool environment ! Great wine selections and amazzzzzing bruschetta! Friendly bartenders! I will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came in a little after 10, waitress is nice and quickly drops off menu but then turns around after leaving and asks if I'm eating. I say yes and she informs me that the kitchen just closed. Don't want to hassle and inform her I'll just be drinking then. Comes back a little while to get drink order and then says I can order meat or cheese options. All of it comes out and the Noir and charcuterie are wonderful. Really appreciate that I could have a late night meal even after the kitchen has closed!!
This place has a great atmosphere and ambiance. Staff never seemed put out even though I was there around 10-11pm and was working on my phone.  Tatiana? (sorry, I'm terrible with names) the staff member was very helpful."}
{"text":"'Sorso'... To Sip. 
This may be the first wine bar that I have ever been to like this where you can do what it's name says...'sorso' or sip first before you buy your glass or your bottle. Ex professional baseball player, Mark Teahen and his wife Lauren took the concept of the 'enomatic' wine dispensing system that they found while visiting Chianti, Italy and brought it to their wine bar here in Scottsdale. A bottle of wine is attached to a tap dispensing system and delivers the same quality as a newly opened bottle for up to four weeks. The beauty of that is that you can try an otherwise pretty pricy sip or taste of wine that would normally be ONLY found in most places by the bottle. Here you can sample it and then decide to splurge on that $200 bottle or not. Maybe it wasn't as good as you thought it would be! There are 32 wines on the interactive dispensing system from all over the world here at Sorso. Upon being seated,  you are 'assigned' a card for your dispensing needs and wishes at the taps with your credit card. Our waitress was Whitney and she was very good at explaining the card, the dispensing system and the iPad that is left at the table. She was a great server overall, considering she had her hands full that night! The iPad is cool too, as it allows you to go through the wines to see if you would rather just have a glass or bottle. Like an iPad wine list at the tip of your fingers! The concept of Sorso is ALL Italy, of course. The menu for food is Italian in nature. Prosciutto; Cappicolla; Salami; Gelato.. you get my point.  We ordered a bruschetta board of four. My friends were comparing the bruschetta to Postino and didn't like it. I loved the bread but could have done with out the salami and prosciutto on the bruschetta being cooked. I ordered a TAPP salad and craved it the next day; IT was that good! The portion size was huge! The TAPP is a combination of fresh shaved turkey breast, avocado and pesto; the dressing is a light olive oil citrusy mix. I always get my dressings on the side so it doesn't overwhelm the taste of the fresh salad. LOVED it. Our beginning wines were amazing. The card concept is perfect and a way to keep track of who is getting/dispensing what for the final bill, so as long as you don't mix up your card with your friends! My friend got a Bubble Flight; I haven't seen a sampling of bubbly anywhere else and what a neat way to sample four VERY generous, different pours of bubbly! Speaking of bubbly, there is even a neat Bubble Float: Prosecco served over Gelato!! It makes me all bubbly inside just thinking of when I can go back to Sorso and taste this delight! 
Sorso is a great place for a date night. There are several beers either by the bottle or on tap, if your not into wines. There are also dessert wines to go with what else?! Italian style desserts. Charcuterie boards;  Cheese boards; Salads; Bruschettas with amazing bread. The patio is a good people watching spot with intimate tables and there are longer community tables too if you are out with a group of people and not on a date night. Sorso also has a yummy looking brunch menu with Italian coffees on the menu. I'm a yes to the returnabilty factor!
On our way out we grabbed a good Italian wine to take home from the market that has take home wines and beer and other various cute Italian things. I can't wait to go back to sip..taste.. pour and savor! I love Italy so I am glad to see a true real Italian wine bar here in the area!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Whenever I go there i always enjoy my food and drinks. Stuff are very friendly and well trained. They always smile and look like they are happy to work there :-))"}
{"text":"Sorso is awesome! Fantastic way to taste a lot of different wines at different price points.  All the appetizers are very tasty.  Cool atmosphere..... Like all Scottsdale Quarter restaurants, this is a place where you should show up properly dressed -no shorts, no flip-flops, no T-shirts.   Great place to have a wonderful glass of wine and people watch!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new wine spot.  Staff are very attentive and knowledgeable!  Happy hour is amazing, with all their house wines, beers and some brushetta's 50% off. They have another 32 wines that are in a wine dispensary system, very cool concept.  Love the vibe!  We will be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a lively place to drink wine and have appetizers and came across this little surprise. Love the wine dispenser concept where you can buy a sip, taste or full glass.  Appetizers were delicious and well portioned.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this concept. When I am out I typically default to my favorite wines- this gives me the opportunity to try wines I might not typically get to enjoy. The room and patio are decorated well- you feel like you can settle in with a group of friends in a welcoming atmosphere. 

I also appreciate what they are doing with their beer selection. They have good options and appreciate the nods to AZ beers. This is a nice option for those in your group who might not be a wine drinker."}
{"text":"Great service and super wine reccomendation.  The staff was excellent and had good attention to detail. The cheese plate was a nice snack."}
{"text":"Very cool concept! Went with a large group for a late-happy hour before a movie at the neighboring iPic. The wine selection was fantastic and it was really fun to taste such a wide variety. The decor was very nice and ambiance was warm and welcoming. Great place for groups or date night."}
{"text":"First time here on a casual date. It was slow for a Sunday evening and we could seat ourselves anywhere we liked.  Tried a couple tables and booths but the air was blowing so cold everywhere we sat... Kind of a pain. Has a lovely Pino nior, humus and the burrata plate. Both ever very well prepared but took a little while to arrive"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out finally and so glad we did!  Called at 4:30 to see if we could get a reservation at 5:00 for 6 people. I didn't think we had a shot on a Friday during happy hour but decided to try. \"No problem, see you soon\". I like it. 

There's a retail \"store\" area when you walk in with super cute items like burlap pillows with fun sayings like \"Wine Not\" and cute food items like a bag of mixed nuts titled \"Nut Sack\" hehe and various wine flavored cotton candy store. 

They took us to a table in a private room because there was no other tables available. Nice touch. 1/2 bottles of wine during happy hour!  Another nice touch. 

They have a choice of 4 food items in the happy hour selection so we ordered them all and were glad we did. The bruschetta had 3 choices cut into 4 pieces. We had the Gorgonzola with honey and fresh seasonal fruit (it was peaches), the sun dried tomato pesto with arugula and the goat cheese with olive tapenade. All were amazing. The roasted brussell sprout with pancetta also incredible. I don't think we left a crumb. The hummus and veggies also beautifully presented and was nicely appointed with fresh veggies. And The Dip - OMG. Served in a crusty bread bowl. Cheesey with both basil and sun dried tomato pesto and extra crusty bread. Also very good with the veggies. 

We left full of good food and nice wine at a really reasonable price. We will definitely go back and soon!"}
{"text":"Found this fantastic wine room while doing a search online and in Yelp.  Great ambiance, great wine selection and love the decor.  Just had a glass of the menu Cab but it was delicious.  Looking forward to being back and using the self-serve wine selection."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try out a new wine bar and the place did not disappoint. I met up with 5 others to check out this place located in the Scottsdale Quarter. It has plenty of seating for couples or groups including some very plush couch seating. It also includes a nice sized patio with misters to help fight the heat (109 was still too hot for our group but in a couple of months it'll be perfect patio weather).
After being seated we were handed their wine list on an iPad (very high tech - bonus points for being cool and organized) that listed a great selection of wines by the glass or bottle. The wines can then be sorted to show the Happy Hour selections available too. You can quickly browse by type of wine (white, red, bubbles etc.). On this menu they also show you their selection of craft beers. If you'd like to know more about any of the wines or beers you can click on the listed item and it takes you to a screen with a description. PLUS if you would like to send yourself an email about the wine/beer you enjoyed you can also do that from the iPad. Nice feature I'd say. They also have a cool tasting option where 32 bottles are in a sort of vending setup. You put some money on a tasting card, insert your card into the machine and pick your pour size. Prices ranged all over the board but still a great way to do your own little tasting.
Prices aren't the most affordable for drinks, however, this is Scottsdale so you pay for location. I was pleased with the Happy Hour options and the prices; a glass will run you $5-7 and I think that's fair. They have a few items available for food on Happy Hour too; 4 types of bruschetta and a hummus board. Both options were more than we expected and are great for sharing. We had 4 bruschetta ($8) plus 3 glasses of wine and 1 beer and with tax and tip it was $32 on Happy Hour. We all left satisfied with the meal, drinks and tab. Our server was great too; friendly and knowledgeable. 
Bathrooms are clean and stocked and the decor was nice with several wine type decorations. Overall it was a great experience and I'd definitely go back again. Good job Sorso!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date night or a girl's night out! They have one of those machines where you can try a bunch of different types of wines for a smaller taste, a mid pour or a full glass. It's pay as you go, which is nice (most I've been to, you have to prepay a certain amount). The food was incredible. We had the prosciutto melon dish with burrata then ordered four bruschetta: pancetta with dates, Brussels sprouts with goat cheese, salami pesto and the fruit mascarpone with honey. All were SO GOOD! Such great combinations and flavorful. I even liked it better than Postino's bruschetta options which is a BIG statement, I'm aware. Great ambiance, cute patio. A must try!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem of a place in Scottsdale Quarter. I remember when my guy (#mrbermuda) was here back in March, it was not quite open yet but we made note to check it out whenever he came back into time. Fast forward to yesterday we were walking around and noticed that they were not only open for business, but had a great happy hour to boot! Score. First off, it is nice quaint little place. There is a bigger room in the back to host a small sized private party, which I may do for my birthday next year.. ok ok let me focus :) The gentleman that greeted us was a really nice guy who let us know that the happy hour was from 3-6 and all the glasses of wine were half off or you could get a bottle of wine for half off. Hmm score!! Also there were four of their bruschetta's that were on happy hour as well so you could get all four of them for $8 or double up on them or just four of the same. Whatever worked for you. Double score! So we ordered Gorgonzola, Honey, Seasonal Fruit, Goat Cheese, Olive Tapenade, Roasted Red Tomatoes, Avocado and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto, Arugula. One thing I really liked is the fact that their bread was warm. It may sound weird but it made the bruschetta taste even better not all places do that (or if they do, but the time I get it, it is cold). I am not a huge olive fan but my favorite one was the goat cheese and olive tapenade. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it was really, really good. They were not stingy with their toppings either (as some places can be from time to time) Each bite was an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. (Party in my mouth woot woot) I hate to say it but cannot remember which wines we had last night. I know, I know fail on my part, but that just means I will have to go back. Oh another thing, they have wine dispensers in the back in which they do on the honor system. So they give you a card and you go and pick which wine you would like and it automatically dispenses it for you in the size you want 4oz, 6oz, or 8oz I believe and you pay for the wine and the size you pick. Pretty cool if I do say so myself. 

So if you are wondering if I will be back? Well duh? I mean it is wine? How could I not go back? Plus it is near work so happy hour time and the service was fabulous and for only $25 three glasses of wine and a bruschetta board, you can't go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"I'm really not a wine snob. And I really don't like too many bubbles, but I had a bubbles flight here on a girls night out and loved it! I actually think they only offer this one flight. For everything else, you're on your own. Well - they'll help you. Everyone seemed knowledgable and attentive the night I was there - in spite of the weekend madness that had ensued upon the quarter. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here. The patio is small, but perfect for people watching!"}
{"text":"Went for New Year's Eve.  Had a prix fixe menu (which I am not a fan of), but the food was delicious.  The wait staff was that perfect combination of attentive, without being intrusive.  Now, I'm a beer drinker and I wasn't impressed with the selection which was included in our dinner price, so I switched to red wine, and the suggestion by our waiter was delicious. The DJ was phenomenal. The ambience was okay to good. So why 4 and not 5?  Where the heck's the dance floor?  If you're going to play such great music, you need a place for folks to dance. Will definitely go back to try their unique feature regarding trying different wines."}
{"text":"First time there. Totally enjoyed the wine machine. Cheese plate and unbelievably yummy bruschetta. Will definitely go back. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Love all the wine options here and how you can make your own flights! Such a great spot will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and wine so good for a date night. Also the bruschetta was bomb and the prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience here. The night got cut short because the Scottsdale Quarter was having issues with the fire alarm, but that isn't any thing they can control. 

I hated red wine, but this place gave me the chance to try a few and I really recommend to anyone who needs a great tasting wine experience to go here. It's really cool. 

Try the wine called: If You See Kay"}
{"text":"Sorso
A Sip, A Taste, A Pour - I'll have them all!!

Excellent service, genuinely enjoyable atmosphere, unique way to enjoy wine & big flavor bruschetta! 

Service - I have been a few times now and have had consistently great service!  The bartenders and waitresses have all been very welcoming and helpful in educating me on the \"wine on tap\" system that Sorso offers.

Atmosphere - Sorso has an incredibly fun and interactive atmosphere!  They have wine bottles \"on tap\" so you can try vintages & varietals without feeling completely overwhelmed!  Since you can try the wine by the ounce - 1oz (A Sip), 3oz (A Taste) or 6oz (A Pour) - you can venture out of your vino comfort zone without breaking the bank!!!!!  It's brilliant.

THEIR BRUSCHETTA - is a constant craving now.  Sorso's bruschetta delivers a flavor profile that will not disappoint.  As if their happy hour treats weren't enough, they offer breakfast bruschetta that will change your life!"}
{"text":"This wine dinner was a complete let down. I am so disappointed that I'm considering leaving early. 

First, the menu is basically vegetarian. It was not posted ahead of time and had I know it would be this way I would have NEVER considered paying $40. Salad was small, soup was cold, lasagna was the most awkward combination of ingredients.

Second, the wine pairing was less than mediocre. All plates should have been paired with white wine as everything was cream based. The kale and potato soup was cold, filled with pepper, and paired with a heavy red wine. If there is anything I've learned in my 10 years of drinking wine is that red wine increases the spicy flavor in food and is not a popular pairing choice. Also, the entree (Holiday lasagna including spinach, mushrooms, ricotta, and nutmeg) was paired on the menu with a Sangiovese yet they poured a Chianti. 

Third, the service and timing of the dinner was HORRIBLE. The first course, a tiny spinach and goat cheese salad, was served almost 30mins after the posted start time. There was at least 15-20mins in between courses where we just sat there waiting. Everything seem extremely disorganized and poorly planned. 

I will NEVER go to a wine dinner event at Sorso again. I am so disappointed because I have never had such a negative experience here. LESSON LEARNED - just because a restaurant is known for great tapas and wine doesn't mean they will excel at a wine paired dinner."}
{"text":"Met a few friends for a quick happy hour.  I love the ambiance at Sorso.  I'm not a wine person, so I ordered a beer on tap.  I asked the server to bring me whichever wheat they had.  I don't recall the name, but I was very happy.  It was only $3 at happy hour.  Can't really complain."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. What's up with only having Mexican coke light? And if you are dropping off a beverage and see my water glass is only 1/2 full, perhaps bring more water.  Waitress was MIA thru most of the meal. Never got a check back on whether or not food was good or we needed anything. Had to ask the hostess to fin our waitress to get our bill. 
Food was \"meh\". I ordered bruschetta, but it was absolutely not what was described in the menu.  If I order mascarpone nuts and berries I expect those ingredient. Seriously there was 1 nut on the entire slice. My bresaola was supposed to be with goat cheese, but I got butter."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've never had food here so this review only covers wine, service, and ambience. The first time I ever came here was for happy hour, and I had a really awesome experience. I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The ambience has a modern, upscale vibe. The second time I came here, the place was practically empty. I was hovering at the bar for a few minutes, trying to get the attention of a server, and nobody noticed. I got tired of waiting so I yelled out to a woman in the back and she got somebody to seat me. I asked to taste a shiraz (it was a $20 or so glass of wine and wanted to taste it before committing to a full glass). My server proceeded to tell me that they don't offer tasters of non happy hour wines because they come from tap. Like what? I have never been to a restaurant, wine bar, or any bar that doesn't allow for tasters of wine. And wouldn't the wine on tap make it easier to give me a taste because you wouldn't have to open a new bottle (still confused about this)? Most places that are serious about wine acknowledge that everybody has a different palette and might not like the same wines. I ended up not liking the wine he brought, and luckily the server changed it out for me. The server was nice enough but I also felt like he was talking down to me (maybe because I'm young?). Overall, I just can't take a place that doesn't allow tasters on full priced glasses seriously. I just felt really obnoxious asking for a replacement glass and don't think that customers should ever have to feel that way at a place that serves wine."}
{"text":"My Sorso experience was so-so. Maybe it's because I wasn't quite sure how to \"sorso\" exactly. I mean, I read as many of the raving, yelping reviews to get ready for the experience.  And somehow when I got there, I missed it.  I didn't catch the buzz....literally.  It was more like a fuzz. Don't get me wrong, it was good times with friends and people watching. Service was first-class all the way but that alone won't have me planning on going back."}
{"text":"Nice selection of wine with cool eats. Great date spot. Grilled cheese flight...just sayin'."}
{"text":"Great place to people watch and a nice selection of wines. Bruschetta was good, not remarkable. Service was slow but it was a very crowded Saturday night."}
{"text":"We had a really great time here tonight.  We came at 5:30 PM towards the end of happy hour on a Friday evening.  The energy/vibe was very fun and energetic.

Happy Hour 2 for 1 on select wines. Their wine selection is good and you get a touchpad to pick what you want, which is nice.  I love using touchpads.

We ordered the Caprese Sando with prosciutto.  Very good.  I give it 4-stars.  She gives it 5-stars.

The bruschetta was decent.  Rating is 2, 3, and 4 stars depending on which bruscetta you get.

We sat in the high pub tables in the open seating area.  Bartender was very fun, friendly and attentive.  Very good service and sociable/funny.  We really had an awesome time tonight."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. When I go to a wine bar- it's for a good time without being crazy.
Let's separate this place out. The bar= a good time. They have some great bartenders (what do you call ones who serve only wine???)... They're friendly, hospitable, and ready to go.

The actual seating- and the server I've had twice in the past... not so fun. It felt like a burden taking our order. Don't people know what makes a good tip??? Get us jolly on some wine and most people become very giving. Don't kill that vibe!

Let's chat about the self serve wine... not a fan. I don't like standing awkwardly at spigots of wine as if it's a soda fountain. Unique idea but it's not winning me over. I'm happy that it's an option. 

So here you have it- I will sit nicely at the bar, with the ever so friendly bartenders serving my wine for me. Have I mentioned they have a good happy hour special? Chea!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of getting to pick and pour your own wine! This place is upscale yet, affordable. The servers are knowledgeable and nice Their Bruschetta is fantastic too. I cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I held a happy hour here for 30 people and it could not have been better.  The staff was accommodating even when we branched out of the private area (Cellar 24) and really on it for customer service.  The food was outstanding (definitely order the Tutto! platter and any of the Bruschetta) and the drinks were perfect.

And Lauren really helped with figuring out how much food to order initially.  It really couldn't have gone any better.  :)"}
{"text":"Great Place. Amazing Wine. If you like white  - get Pinot Grigio Esperto, if you like red - get Cab Conn Creek ( the best cab I've tried so far). Charcuterie Piccolo - loved it- best selection of meats, cheeses and olives- good portion for 2!!! Nice music, fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"awesome selection of wine, very hip vibe and the live music wasnt over powering at all. i cant wait to go again and bring some friends"}
{"text":"I go back and forth on this place... But I think I've made up my mind. Cool concept, but not really worth it. Ive been twice and both times I felt like we just wasted a lot of money for what we got. Fun place to show people that are in town (I guess) it's pretty to walk around there, but isn't somewhere I would just \"go\". There's tons of other places to eat and drink in that area that I would easily choose over here. 
I'll start off with saying, no matter where I am service is everything to me. With that being said the service here.. mediocre, at best. You can tell they pick and choose who they'll give better service to - which I really don't like... 
To start, I had asked the hostess for a booth, if we could (we were a party of three). It wasn't busy and there was one available. She told me she couldn't, they are meant for parties of 5, which seemed reasonable so I said it was okay no worries. She sat a party of three almost directly after us, when there were tables next to us.. They pick and choose who to give better service to..
As far as the wines with the cards, it is fun and it's a cool concept like I said, but with zero description as you stand there.. You kinda just have to choose one. Some are pricey and if you're going to spend money on a nicer wine.. You'd at least like to know a little about it.. Or I know we did. Luckily, we did like the wine and the bruschetta was nice.. (..but so? For what you pay, it should be)
Our server gave us some whatever explanation of everything with zero enthusiasm or personality.. I felt more of an inconvenience to her..
Bottom line, we've come twice. Same experience. I really wanted to like this place, but there are better wine bars in the valley with much better service and overall experience. 
I'm the wine drinker of us two, so I know my boyfriend isn't dying to go back, but if I wanted to go I know he would take me. Unfortunately I really don't see myself suggesting we go again.. Nor would I recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the variety of wine. It was a little pricier than expected but a good range of wine prices. The food was decent, nothing spectacular. I went with a friend who ended up getting food poisoning after we went here and was puking for two days straight. I would go again for the drinks."}
{"text":"Have never been to a place like Sorso before and I have to say, I thought it was really cool! The atmosphere was really nice. I went for happy hour on a Friday and was glad that it wasn't overly busy. 
One thing that I thought was interesting and unique was that they had iPads as the menus! I had not seen something like that before and I thought it was neat. They had a good wine selection too, and a bunch of them were on the happy hour deal, two glasses for the price of one. Thought that was a great HH deal! The server was super nice too, helped us figure out how everything worked and such. Overall cool experience here, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Self serve wine selection is pretty pricey. Same as if you were being served. Bruschetta pretty good."}
{"text":"So happy this wine bar opened in North Scottsdale.  I was at Sorso Friday night for Happy Hour
and it was great! We had the Bruschetta and veggies with hummus. Great selection of wine. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable place!! Great atmosphere, on point service, and the food is solid!! I'm glade I broke my iPhone otherwise I would've never found this place. Hidden spot great joint!!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd like this place, but was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered three different bruschetta' sand the muffuletta sandwich and LOVED it!  We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - UB40 - Red Red Wine)

Red, red wine room
Goes to Sorso...
Makes me forget that I
Still need to write

Red, red wine room
It's up to you
All I have to do is
Swipe my wine card.....
Swipe my wine card....


I'm going to give this place my love simply because it was a new experience for me.  A wine buffet....okay well keep me away for awhile!  

The concept is definitely cool and new to me and the atmosphere at this place was really chill.  Sorso has a modern East coast open city ambiance perfect for the Quarters area.  I was supposed to come with a friend, but ended hanging by myself!  No worries, got my wine card and went for it.  There is a wine vending machine with multiple wines in stock and you insert your card for the amount of pour you want; 1.5oz, half, or full; and you're charged accordingly.  

As for the food I ordered their TAPP sandwich.  I wanted to try their bruschetta, but I'll save that for next time.  The sandwich came with turkey breast shavings, avocado, pancetta, and pesto.  The combo was fine, but I didn't really care for the bread since I found it dry and had to take a sip of water after every bite.  Guess that's where the wine buffet comes handy haha!   My meal also came with a bag of kettle chips which was cool.  

In the end, Sorso was fun and definitely a spot for some wine sipping.  Service was stellar and on point.  Ambiance is chill and very urban. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Happy hour all day Sunday!

I came here a couple of weeks ago on Sunday and really enjoyed wine and food. 

Happy hour wine is buy one get one free for selected wine.  Since I wasn't driving, oh, I went ahead and had four glasses of wine. They do have a very nice selection of wine, it's all on their iPad. I went through the entire menu to see what they have.  Some really good ones here, great place for those who enjoy wine. Be sure to come with alternative transportation. It's so easy to have too few many drinks here.

Food was fantastic. I ordered two different kinds of bruschetta and enjoyed both equally. They use good ingredients, good flavor, my kind of food. All the food goes very well with wine.

Would love to come back again"}
{"text":"I'm a new fan !!! I'm a very frequent postinos goer but I was not trying to wait on a Monday night so I came to Sorso . The Bruschetta is amazing and so is there wine . The bread pieces are bigger than average and a lot of ingredients on top. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Sorso is a fun new wine bar concept.  While you can sit at the bar and chose from a limited wine by the glass list you can also get a tasting card and try the wines on the tasting wall.  As others have mentioned, you use a card and select wines by the taste, half glass or full glass.

The upside is it's fun to try new wines on the wall in smaller quantities than a full glass.  The downside is you have to get up every time to get a new selection and the descriptions of the wine on the wall are limited.

I did also try the bruschetta when I was at Sorso and the pancetta one was excellent."}
{"text":"Fine wine bar.  Nice place in the scottsdale quarter.  I met some friends up after work for a low key hangout.  Enjoyed trying many different wines."}
{"text":"Very cute and convenient wine bar. They serve wine, beer, small bites and \"sandos\" (sandwiches). It was a little on the pricier side, but what was nice is that they have 32 rotating wines that you can dispense yourself as a 1.5oz, 3oz, or 6oz pour by simply swiping a card they give you and selecting your choice of white or red wine. The wines they have by the glass range anywhere from a silver oaks cab which runs $39 for a 6oz pour to a $2 1.5oz pour for another pretty good, not as well known wine. The small bites are pretty yums. We ordered the bruscetta and the cheese plate, which were both served as a pretty decent portion. 
The service was a little slow, but everyone was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely be back, maybe not as often as id like, due to the price, but this place is perfect for a nice date night."}
{"text":"Sat outside yet could hear the musician performing. It was HH so we ordered 1 wine, 2 nut brown ales (ok). I ate the Brussels board and the Gorgonzola was so rich & creamy. Tried the bread bowl with dip which was tasty but I won't repeat again due to too much carbs. The salmon & olive tapenade bruschetta we're both very good ( the bread delish, soft and thinner than most, yay) and the price just $6 for both. 

The waitress Tara tried hard and Matt the GM is a nice guy. Cya again."}
{"text":"Great wine bar for girls night out! Super cute rustic, modern bar with a nice outdoor patio and Great music. The menu is on a tablet filled with pictures of food and descriptions of their wine selection. I think I saw this on another review but so true, the chairs were way too small at the bar tops! My butt isn't that big and it still was hanging over all sides. Haha. Parking garage is located right behind the restaurant so plenty of close parking. Service was great and he helped explain how everything worked and recommended some wines.

They have a ton of self serve wines on tap. You can ask your server for a card that is hooked to your debit/credit card to go fill your wine glass with a ton of different options at any ounce you choose. You can do anywhere from a taste of wine or a full glass depending on your preference. Be great for a simple wine tasting. You can also order a glass of wine or beer through your server if you choose. I ordered Lambrusco through our server and it was so delicious and chilled perfectly.

They have a ton of great menu options of lite bites, entrees, and shareable boards. We all split some bruschetta and the grilled shishito peppers. The peppers were fun to pass around like Russian roulette to see who got the spicy one but honestly they were boring. They need a good sauce to pair them with especially for $10. The bruschetta was amazing though and huge!! Perfect for sharing and paired so well with the wine. 

Bruschetta I ordered was 4 for $16. Easily feed 2 people very happily:
- green apple w/Brie and Carmel (AMAZING)
- caprese (classic yet so good)
- Brussel sprouts,goat cheese,prosciutto(YUM!)
- roasted tomato & avocado (boring...)

Overall this was a great place and I would highly recommend. Looking forward to bringing more friends and family here to kick back and enjoy some wine and snacks. Thank you (:"}
{"text":"If you want wine, wine and more wine , this place is it. An array of an amazing selection of wines from across the world. This is such a cute place tucked away in the Scottsdale Quarter.  

Ordering was easy.  You get an iPad to make a wine selection, super cool.  The finger food was good, nothing spectacular but good."}
{"text":"Great little place to sit outside and have a glass of wine.  Great service, good munchies to have with wine."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place. We love the idea of wine tasting with the wine dispensers. This did not disappoint - great way to taste different wines before deciding on the perfect glass (albeit a bit expensive as a taste ranges from $4 to $12).  We also wanted an appetizer and settled on the grilled cheese flight. Yes!  I said grilled cheese flight. I was very excited to try 4 little grilled cheese sandwiches with exotic toppings. But, sadly we were quite disappointed. There was way too much bread and so very little cheese . So, we decided to try the bruschetta and this did NOT disappoint. Very yummy and lots of options for the toppings. My recommendation would be yes for the wine and yes for the bruschetta but a big NO for the grilled cheese flight. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town but stay occasionally at the Westin Kierland resort. Wanted to leave the resort to meet friends who are locals, so went to Sorsa yesterday (Friday) at 4 pm to meet friends. 

I have had to come back to edit my original review. At first I said, \"Wine selection was mediocre, bartender was great, waitress was terribly rude and oddly controlling.\"  

However, after reading other reviews today, I realize that I don't even know what the restaurant concept was. I sat down at the bar, was given a paper menu with only a few different wines to select from, and that was it. No idea about the iPad menu, other wine options, or self pour. 

So, maybe bartender wasn't so great either. The waitress was intolerably rude. After a brief interaction with her, I had no desire to stay there. Didn't finish my wine, paid my bill abruptly, (no one asked me why I was leaving) and texted my friends to meet me down the road.  Ended up that we had a great time and very nice wine last night, but not at this place."}
{"text":"The customer service there is amazing! The atmosphere is very chill and laid back, and the wine was great! We loved the iPad menu, very cool! Well done, sorso! Will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"What a cool concept. Love this idea. Apps were amazing. I would like a wine filler in my kitchen! How cool is that. Located in scottsdale quarter where everything is happening. Met a date here and had a great time. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Such a great selection of wine and you can purchase a small taste of several varieties before you make your choice for the evening. Really great appetizers
Try the burrata with Spanish chorizo ... so good
Service was excellent and nice ambience too AND they stay open until midnight!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! I loved the design and decor. But otherwise, I wasn't particularly enchanted with Sorso. The wine list is displayed on a bulky tablet. Even though you still order through the server, it felt impersonal. Instead of asking about the flavor of a wine, I felt like I was suppose to read about it on the tablet. Also for a large wine bar, I thought they would have more wine options by the glass. For example, they only had one Sauvignon Blanc served by the glass. The charcuterie board was good, but not as impressive as some others I have ordered elsewhere. Overall, I enjoyed my evening the Sorso, but it there are so many similar concepts in Scottsdale that I enjoy more."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with half price bottles of wine and great apps. I had the gluten free bruschetta which was awesome...best gluten free whole grain bread I've ever had...made from local gluten free baker. My new fave happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food - Great (just had different bruschetta but soooo good) 
Wine - Great
Ambiance and service - Super!!!"}
{"text":"The tasting card. A most revolutionary take on wine tasting. A self serve wine station, the likes of which you have never seen. Tickle your taste buds with small 2 ounce pours, or a full glass of Dionysian nectar. Enter your card into the machine, select your wine and pour, return to your table and delight your senses. As you sip, peruse the wines on offer and and on tap on your tablet (see prices per glass and per bottle)- which tells you about the wine's flavor profiles and also allows you to save your \"considerations \" for later.

Tastes start at $2, glasses at $7. 

To pair your wines with noshes, bruschetta plates  are in abundance here; as well as charcuterie, salads, and sandwhiches. 

Lunch specials are 11a-2p M-F and for $15 you can enjoy a sandwhich, salad, and a glass of wine or beer. 

Happy hour is 3-6p M-F, glasses of wine $5."}
{"text":"Here on vacation to see some Spring Training games. We came in for lunch. Everything we had was simply amazing. May have to come back one more time before we leave. Our waiter Matthew was great. Helped with some selections & he was spot on."}
{"text":"Come here all the time for happy hour. Eric at the bar is a delight, but everyone else is always amazing too."}
{"text":"What a fantastic concept.  A self-service wine bar offering 32 different quality wines by the glass including Barolo, Bordeaux, Amarone and more from notable wineries across the globe.

How it works:  after you get seated, just give your server a credit card and they will return with some high-end wine glasses and a card-like what you'd use getting into your hotel room.  Insert you card in the wines by the glass machine and choose full, half or quarter glass. Drink and repeat.

Food options: they also offer a bunch of small plates including charcuterie, soups, salads and sandwiches to go with the wine.

My wife and I were there around an hour and a half and ably served by Brendan who gave us the tutorial and helped us with the food options.  We opted for 1/4 glasses so ended up trying 6 different wines each during our visit (all reds).  While we had our favorites (Barolo, Valpolicello) there wasn't anything that wasn't interesting.

A perfect way to spend a Sunday evening.  

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone who likes wine.

We also enjoyed a rich chocolate cupcake with our last sips of hearty red and the charcuterie plate we had was a great compliment to the wine."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening around 5PM. There were only three or four other small parties there at the time. 

We were seated at a table near the back windows. Our server greeted us and asked us if we had been to Sorso before. We told her we had never been there but heard great things and were excited to try it! She explained to us how the card system works then she showed me how to used the wine dispensing machines. I started with a glass of the Silver Oak Cabernet. It was superb! 

For food, we started with the Piccolo, which is an assortment of meats, cheeses and olives served with French bread. We also ordered 4 bruschetta: strawberry and Brie, salami, smoked salmon, and roast beef. All were delicious. Be warned the bruschetta are pretty good sized! We definitely over ordered and ended up taking about half of it to go. 

We sampled a few of the other wines as well. A bonus is that you can do a 2oz pour to see if you like the wine before you pull the trigger on the full glass. 

The service here was great! I wish I could remember the name of our server because she was fabulous! Definitely would come here again. Great food, great atmosphere, great wine!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch in a Friday afternoon. There were only 2 other tables occupied in the entire place. It took 35 min for salad to arrive. Too long in my opinion. Food is good but not great."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!  We love Sorso!!!  From the unique wine list that offers so many varietals, to the fabulous salads and charcuterie it is a perfect spot for lunch!!  We have been to Sorso many times and will continue to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Classy and sassy! Came with a friend late on a weeknight. Bruschetta and chef's board were amazing! The wine dispensary card is worth it, although the selection for those who enjoy light, fruity whites is limited. The apple dessert wine was a really good close to the evening. Such a great atmosphere. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!!! After looking for weeks for the perfect place to host my boyfriends surprise fortieth birthday I was lucky enough to get in touch with Lauren, she made everything so easy and accommodated our large group in the private room here. Everything went so smoothly and all the guests raved about the food and service! Tara our server rocked it! And the manager was a huge help too!! Thanks so much for making this night so fun!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Carter recommended a great bottle of wine. His wine expertise is very good. Awesome wine!!! Austin Hope 2015. Sorso Wine Room is a great place to enjoy a nice bottle of wine, watch the D-Back game, or listen to great music."}
{"text":"Great location, decent wine selection and overall pleasant place to relax and catch up with friends. Has great happy hour also and entertainment a few night a week. I have only had wine here so can's comment on the food. What I've seen looks good. Love sitting on the cozy patio seeing the people walk by in the neighborhood, also easier to hear on the patio. Can be a little loud inside. Service has been decent also. Nothing too friendly, but the job gets done."}
{"text":"Our server Josh was the best! Very attentive, professional and nice!
The various bruschetta is very good and they have a great wine selection
The decor is hip, and chic.
Had a very good time, will be back"}
{"text":"Nice wine bar in an outdoor upscale shopping center. Good happy hour, known for many interesting varieties of Bruschetta, and antipasto platters. Still a bit pricey for Happy Hour. But hey, it's Scottsdale! Will return!"}
{"text":"Amaze-balls!!!! service.. wine selections.. cheese plates.. (tasted some food but I was with friends who ordered gluten free. It was good) ambience.. love ALL of it!! Its a great place to meet with your friends or even have a date night. It's not too quiet and not too loud. And the music is modern! Not your usual movie soundtrack station.. I've been here before and will come back. Just wish there was easier parking but it's worth it."}
{"text":"What a way to bring in the new year!!! 

Last night I went to Sorso with a friend because 1) they have $20 bottle of wine and 2 bruschetta AND 2) the bachelor! First of all, those two things go together like white on rice so when I saw this event on Facebook I knew it was meant to be! 

We started off with a bottle of their Riesling called \"Shine\", and for bruschetta we got tomato and salami ! The Riesling definitely shined on my tastebuds, loved it. It's a really sweet wine, so it would be an excellent desert wine. The second bottle that we had (now don't go judging we were here for almost 3 hours, so we had lots of water too. Lol) it was a Sparkling Rosé! LOVED IT! Definitely my new go to wine for desert or maybe just because. Our second round of bruschetta was Brie with apples and Carmel, and another meat that was really good. To be honest, the bachelor was on so I am guilty of not remembering what I ordered the second time around. Hehehe.

ONLY reason I gave this review 4 stars is because they didn't have very many tv's, so it was really hard to find a table to watch the Bachelor from. Also, I wasn't a fan of the tabletop chairs. They were really small! 

Overall, it was a great girls night out! Definitely be back next Monday!"}
{"text":"Sorso is my go to spot for all my girls nights out... They have an extensive selection of wines, high and low there is something for everyone. I love that you can try a little of everything, or get a bottle of something you love ( I have commitment issues so I always try a few different ones!). Their service is always friendly and I find that their staff is typically pretty wine knowledgeable and can steer you in a pretty good direction based on what your likes and dislikes are. 

If your a wine lover like me than Sorso is your spot!"}
{"text":"You don't know me, Yelp! reviewer, but Sorso Wine Room does.
You don't know me, so you might think $50 is a preposterous amount for a glass of wine.  If you do, then you've probably never had a truly divine Russian River pinot noir.  For a mere twelve bucks and change you can sample one from Martinelli Vineyards, here at Sorso Wine Room.
You don't know me, Yelp! reader, but the chance to taste a near $200 bottle without rounding up six of your friends is just one of the many thrills you can only enjoy at Sorso.
You don't know me Yelp!er, but my friend Jeff at the bar does.  He prefers a corner stool, if one's available, but he'll sit at any open spot & stand if any lady is.  He'll drink an Orange Wit if it's on draft(the un-official suds of nearby Liv residents) or a Mother Road from the bottle if it's not.  If you had a bad day at work he'll probably buy you a drink, and if you had a bad week with your sports wagers, he may even pick up your whole tab.  If you're fortunate enough to buy him one(and I hope you are & you do), you'll probably have a friend for life, if you're worth half a lick.
You don't know me, future Sorso employee , but you'll have the pleasure of knowing these gents right quick, so you might as well learn what's in their glass(or flute): Anthony's having the Borgo(the manliest Prosecco this side of Rome), Travis cracks the Whip(white blend, by Murrietta) and you should probably get 2 bordeaux glasses and a wine card ready if you see Jered or Chris V. coming.

You can keep that playing if you like, or you can come to Sorso & tip a smooth cab(like Vineyard 29's 'Cru') to a big ol' Pandora slab of Bob Marley, The Black Keys or some awesome 90's hip-hop(see the Boys, Beastie; Bastard, Ol' Dirty; or Smalls, Biggie), depending on the time of night, and where else can you do that?

{"text":"Wine: 4/5
NomNomz: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: Trendy, casual, laid-back

Sorso, ohhhh Sorso! Why don't they have you everywhere?!!

This is another one of my favorite places in Scottsdale, hands down. My only complaint is the wine price, it's not the place you go to get a cheap glass.... So be careful when swiping your card and testing all the yummy wines, because they'll definitely start adding up. If you are tasting a sip, make sure it's worth the $7+ a taste. I will say, they do have excellent choices, but a few sips of great wine for over $7 is a bit pricey. There are cheaper options available, just make sure to look at the prices before you make your selection (like the $30 glass of Silver Oak). I loooove me some Silver Oak, it's one of my favorite Cabs, but $30/glass adds up quickly.

Wine: The wine wall always has a chilled white wine section, typically some sort of rose, a bunch of old world red wines and some Cali options as well. They swap them out every so often, so it's fun to go again when they've swapped out the options.

Service: The wait staff is really great. I've never had a complaint. They're super nice and very attentive. You can either swipe your card at the wine wall, or you can also sit down with an iPad and pick from 100's of mouth watering selections. Either way, there is always someone checking on you to see if you need anything. 

Nomz: Yummy snacks are also on point in case you want to cleanse your palettes. They've got excellent salads and bruschetta boards to select from, and smaller dishes as well. You can't go wrong with the charcuterie tray, and they have super yummy spreads that come with it.

Great for a day spot for lunch and a glass of vino (or beer!) and also super cute for happy hour or dinner as the sun goes down. Pick a spot on the patio before it gets too hot in the summer time.

Sun, Monday: 11am-10pm 
Happy Hour: Mon-Fri: 3pm-6pm"}
{"text":"Awesome place whether you're a wine lover, craft beer aficionado or just looking for some tasty food. Went with a group of 4 and we sampled a little of everything.  We had 4 Bruschetta's, the Prosciutto de Parma, Pancetta, Smoked Salmon and Goat Cheese.  All were delicious and left me wanting more. We also had a few sandwiches, one of them was the The Mualetta, yummy!!! Good selection of wine for everyone, same with the craft beer. The ambiance was also good. The tv's are a great addition as well, especially since I was able to watch my college basketball team that evening. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend Sorso and I plan on going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great new edition to Scottsdale Quarter.  Went with co-workers for lunch.  Hip, comfortable, modern design.  Food was spot on.  Unique options compared to other wine bars I have been to.  Will for sure be back soon."}
{"text":"my wife and I are in Scottsdale for her birthday from Vegas. After reading the reviews for Sorso we decided to go. Absolutely the right decision. From the service to the wine and food, Sorso is incredible. Do not miss going here."}
{"text":"Fabulous staff, great food, especially the dips and sandwiches. And great vibe.

Scottie is a great bartender. Lots of fun. 

Don't expect cocktails, though. It's strictly wine and beer."}
{"text":"The best bruschetta ever...SERIOUS! Great servers with great personalities.  I love to sit with friends, a bottle of wine, and their amazing bruschetta... great place! Tip: ask to sit in Joey's section."}
{"text":"Great addition to Scottsdale quarter - awesome happy hour, nice servers and a lot of yummy food to chose from! Love the bruschetta boards and cheese plates! This place is a must for a girls night or if your looking for a cool new happy hour spot."}
{"text":"We love Sorso and it's unique ambiance. The wine selection is amazing and the environment is fun and inviting. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I wanted to come here after reading the great reviews on their bruschetta. Not being a big wine person, I mostly came for the food. To be honest, I prefer Postino's bruschetta the most. However, if you love wine, you will love this place. They give you an iPad which has information on all of their wines that you can read about. They also have a self-serve wine machine where you can serve yourself different portions."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite place for a girl's night out, ever. I yelped \"girls night out\", and this is what was suggested. I am so glad my girlfriend and I came here. We had the best time. We got the tasting card, and ended up having about 6 samples each. We got the bruschetta (all of which was phenomenal - the best bruschetta I've ever had!!! Even better than Postino's, and that used to be my high water mark). The Italian sandwich was amazing, our server was so much fun, and it was an overall great night. We ended up spending about 3 hours here!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, it can be a little difficult to find. 

Their claim to fame is that they have 150 wines by the bottle. 

Upon being seated, they will give you an ipad so you can save your orders or potential orders in a \"shopping cart\". You cannot order through the iPad, only through the server so do not overexert your tired brain trying to figure this out. 

As a creature of habit, I went with the Napa Valley Cab. No complaints. It was however the last pour of the bottle. Because I did not get the full 6 ounces, my glass of wine was prorated! That was a first! So if you think you're going to charm your server or bartender for a heavy pour, forget about it! 

For food we ordered  a salad and a few of the BRUSCHETTAS. They were all DELICIOUS and a phenomenal DEAL. There are multiple options, but my favorites were the MOZZERELLA, PROSCUITTO DE PARM and the HUMMUS. They come
2 for $10, 
4 for $16 
8 for $30 

I was starving when I walked in and I wasn't able to finish 2 myself. This is a great place to enjoy some good wine, tasty food and great company in a trendy ambiance."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sorso Wine Room and quickly became my favorite wine bar! Our server, Joey, was absolutely wonderful. He was not only knowledgeable about the restaurant, wines, and industry; but also the perfect balance of being accommodating and friendly! Would definitely recommend coming here and be sure to ask for Joey as your server!"}
{"text":"We arrived here during peak dinner hours.  Since it was late October the weather is so nice you can't avoid to sit outside in their patio.  Lucky for us there was one table available.  They do have an extensive wine list so be ready to spend some time looking through the wine list if you're a wine-o.  Anything from the bruschetta list will tickle your belly.  Each cut into 4 pieces it's enough to sample many of them if you're on a date.  Service was great and the wine was delicious.  I'll be back for more On a casual evening."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The waitress had a lot of knowledge about the wines and the concept of having the card with wines \"on tap\" is really cool.  We sampled several different wines that normally you would have to shell out a lot of money for the bottle.  

The food was delicious.  We got a cheese board and it was really well made.  The sandwich was really gourmet and the salad was delicious as well.  I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour!! $4 glass of wine? YES PLEASE! The staff is also very friendly and accommodating and the ambiance is great.

Indoor and outdoor seating, and they're open super late--always a plus! I didn't have a chance to try the food, but I'll be back to do so.

The dessert selection is limited, but the gelato was pretty good. Don't expect it to be creamy though, it's more of a sorbet."}
{"text":"My first visit to Sorso had some big positives and big negatives that combined into an overall pleasant experience.

Big positives - Really friendly staff; something not always present at Scottsdale Qtr.  My favorite thing, though, was the wine dispenser that allowed us to try many different wines without having to commit to a whole glass.  For a few dollars I finally got to try the Far Niente chardonnay I've always wanted to try, but at roughly $40 a bottle at the wine store, was afraid I wouldn't like it...and I didn't. So that worked out well.  Also was able to have some amazing reds that would typically be way above my budget.

Big negatives - The space is too small.  You have to squeeze through tight spaces between tables and bump into people to get to and from the wine dispenser. Tables are too small for wine, food and one's few belongings like a purse or cell phone.  The iPad menu also seems an overengineered, unnecessarily expensive idea, and we found it useless.  

I enjoyed myself at Sorso.  Would definitely return at non-peak times."}
{"text":"What a great find ... amazing little wine bar .. perfect after a day of walking, talking and shopping near by.

I wanted something sweet and our server brought me a sample of their Reisen (yes please!!) not syrupy sweet .. very good!!

We also ordered the 2 for $10 bruschetta.. gargonzola, grapes & honey (sweet & savory in one bite).. I highly recommend this one.. we also had the smoked salmon with mascarpone & arugula..

And the Boss flatbread with pesto, turkey & prosciutto.. delicious crunchy crust.. perfect flavor pairing .. 

Inviting dining room with inside & outside patio seating .. server was super friendly .. would definitely recommend and hope to get back to soon!! Thanks for the perfect night cap!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a pleasant lunch here today. He had the bruschetta and I had the muffuletta sandwich. They were both excellent. As it was lunch, we weren't able to sample the wine, but we will be back for what looks like a very nice happy hour and an excellent variety of wine. The ambience and service were also excellent. The only downside was the background music, which had too much Michael Jackson. Maybe some jazz..."}
{"text":"What an awewome idea! You get to sample a wide range of good wine from 2006 Silver Oak Cab (selling on line at 125 a bottle) to  more affordable wines like 2013 If You See Kay (20 a bottle). Definitely coming back for more sampling!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and LOVED it.  Really fun atmosphere, very cool set up the way you can try out different wines.  FABULOUS FOOD AND SERVICE.  Our waitress Tracy was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Will go back FOR SURE!!!"}
{"text":"Came in today for happy hour (3-6) 
I ordered the Ortaggio and two single bruschettas.  
Everything came out in a timely manner and tasted amazing.  Scottie (the bartender) was very attentive, not only to me but to guests walking in AND guests already seated.   
I'm a huge fan of Postino so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  
I'll definitely be back in, thanks again Scottie!"}
{"text":"I hosted a private party at Sorso and they went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. Paige, Lauren, and the entire staff were amazing to work with...whatever the occasion you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Walked in, waited 15 min, never acknowledged by anyone. Walked out, went across the street to kona grill."}
{"text":"Had so much fun at Sorso last night! Matthew is an awesome bartender. The Motto is my new favorite Zin. And they have gluten free bruschetta. Great, little intimate spot at the Quarter. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in a couple of weeks ago for Happy Hour in my search for the best Happy Hour in Phoenix. We were in love with the atmosphere. Done incredibly well. Had a little back room that appeared to have a private event going on. I wanted to join them! lol   We ordered the charcuterie board and it was by far the best I have ever had!! Highly recommend it. Very generous. Its why I am giving them 5 stars! Our waiter was really sweet and helpful. It was our first visit and she was very patient with us. Its a little complicated at first to understand how the Ipad menu works and how to order the wine in the dispensers. Really great selection of wines. Wish they had more local AZ wines though. But some really great choices so I can't complain. The wines in the dispensers were on the expensive side. I wish HH applied to them. Even if it was $2 off a glass. This would of put them over the top for me!!  My husband got the Burrata salad and it was very good. Overall I recommend trying Sorso!!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the wine pouring concept they have is interesting.  I tried the caprese sandwich add prosciutto - the sandwich was good, but a tad pricey at 14 bucks.  Also, would have preferred the prosciutto was uncooked as the texture was off when cooked.  I would probably come back in the future with a group of friends, but there are other places I enjoy more at this time for less money."}
{"text":"I love this place, I visited the week of Christmas with six other friends and we all had a great time. Food menu choices were amazing  and the wines excellent, I opted for trying the wines and it turned out to b e a great idea, because I got to taste several wibes.  The service was spot on and the ambiance was up beat. I certainly will go back soon."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic evening here enjoying my Birthday!    The atmosphere was very nice and their \"wine pour\" system was very cool and convenient.   Definitely worth a night out to check out."}
{"text":"I love the place, nice wine bar concept, amazing service, fancy wine glasses BUT I expected more from the food. I ordered bruschetta and it was all bread, with sprinkles of veggies. Pastinos bruschettas are better. Other than that it was good:)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and I'm so glad I did. Great lunch deals, amazing service! I love the options and the decor, very trendy. Great variety in wine. I can't wait to come back and check out their night scene."}
{"text":"I loooove visiting Sorso - do so with groups and even alone. Simply put, it's fun. The single serving wine wall contains a pretty large variety of bottles. They're grouped, so you may find yourself pulling from only one section if you're, say, just a fan of crisp whites. When you are seated, Sorso gives you a card that is linked to your credit card. You insert that card into the grouping that houses the wine you want to try, then you place your glass under that bottle's spout, and select what portion you want. What's so wonderful is that one of the three portion sizes is tiny - it offers just a taste. This enables you to try wines you've been curious about without committing to an entire bottle. The other sizes are (1) full glass and (2) 1/2-glass. (I think the 3rd quantity is 1/4th-glass?)
I've been quite happy with their food, too. Bruschetta, meat and cheese plates...you name it. I've found them all to be very savory and flavorful. 
The service, too, has been truly that- serving. They're kind and attentive. 
Sometimes when I'm at the Quarter during the day, I'll stop in at the macaron shop next to Sorso, pick up a couple macarons, and then sit at Sorso with a glass of wine & savor my sweets. ...and the staff doesn't bark at me for bringing in my little treats. :)
The ambiance is lovely as well. It's rustic and warm, yet airy and light because of all the windows.
Note that this is not a huge place - it wouldn't be able to accommodate a group of 15+ without the group having to wait a while. But it's perfect for parties of 6ish or less.
My sole complaint, which really isn't a complaint, is that they're not open later. Truly this is not a complaint, it's a compliment because I just wanna stay longer! :-)"}
{"text":"Service is exceptional! Bar stools entirely too small. LOL.

I came here on a date and we had a great time. They obviously have tons of wines to choose from and you can do so on a fancy little tablet they give you. I like sweet/buttery white wines so my date was helping me choose one, we settled on one for me based on its description alone because the thing was hilarious. Our bartender came to take our order, based on what I chose he asked me if I like my wines more sweet and I said why, yes, I do! So instead he recommended a different wine, which was perfect. The fact that he knew to ask me that question was awesome. They clearly know their stuff! 

Aside from being knowledgeable they were all so friendly and cool! Even the general manager came over and checked on us at one point. Great personalities and an overall great vibe in the place. Also, on a side note my date broke a wine glass and nicked his finger a tad and they rushed to get him some first aid items (unasked for kind you), even though it was just a pin prick, it was very nice of them. 

I didn't try the food so I can't speak on that and it was the day before Thanksgiving so I'm not sure what the normal crowd is like, but if you're in the area I'd definitely say give them a go!"}
{"text":"Sorso is hands down my favorite hidden treasure I've found since moving to Scottsdale. The service is always outstanding and the amazing vibe and fantastic live music is impossible to beat. I found this wine room on Yelp and now I'm addicted to the bruschetta and all of the wine (especially the blue wine).  I'm so lucky to live right around the corner, so I get to come enjoy this hidden gem anytime that I want. I highly recommend Sorso to anyone that loves good wine and awesome food!!"}
{"text":"4 instead of 5 because I love the idea of wine tastings on a prepaid card however the food took quite a while to come out (but was delicious) and our server seemed to have been confused with how to split a check. Granted we had a few different splits but we also offered to pay all together, if we had known it was going to take approximately 35 minutes to split our checks we likely would have just paid all together. I believe our Sorso may have been a little understaffed as our server rarely came back to check in on us. 

I specifically got up to check out the dessert case to check out the options and was waiting for when our server came back to ask what the flavors were since they weren't labeled.  He never came back to check on us... so I never got to ask about the cupcakes... bummer. 

The next time we saw him was when we had to waive him down to grab our checks. Could have just been too much for him to handle. I'll be back but hopefully will see some better service!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great for friends or date night. Wonderful concept of a self serve wine bar where you place a Sorso debit card in the machine and pour yourself a drink. Small 1/4 glasses to a full glass to try it all. Tasty meat and cheese platters as well. Definately come back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday celebration and had a great time. 
The food- AMAZING!!!  Bruschetta was the best I have ever had by far. Yummy!!!
Great selection of wine but a bit pricey - that is the only reason I rated this restaurant with 4 stars."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was welcomed by staff. The staff is so friendly and helpful. 
Sorso's food options are delicious! I love the Brussel Sprouts! My food came out quick and I devoured it! 
I love Sorso they have a great vibe. I could hang out all day. Go check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came into sorso for the first time and had Gareth as my server. He recommended the best bruschetta and took time out of his busy night to grab me a few samples of wine. His taste was excellent and my meal was fantastic. He took care of my table the entire 2 hours we were there and made sure we were always taken care of! I will be back and asking for him again!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times fair price great food excellent Decor.. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great space, pleasant knowledgeable servers and good food.  Like the concept of serving yourself and picking the size you want.  Bruschetta was delicious.  We ordered the Gusto Tutto! (all of it) platter since there were 5 of us.  Very creative but skimpy on the cheese, olives and nuts.  Could delete the additional hummus/veggie platter since the same thing was also on the meat platter.  Otherwise a great first try.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  I especially like their happy hour!  Very relaxed place and always good service!"}
{"text":"We visited Sorso twice last week during our 10 day visit to Scottsdale.  First visit was my wife and I and we had a lovely experience.  We tried the self service option with about 2 and a half dozen wines.  For us this was cool because we were able to try several wines that we ordinarily might not want to splurge for.  You can try a 1.5 oz, 3 oz of 6 oz pour and of course pay according to the size of the pour.  The food is trendy cool brochettes and boards of different types.  Right up our alley.  We visited a few nights later with our son and we sat at the bar and just had wine.  We enjoyed it just as much.  I can see where this might not be for everyone, but we really liked the variety of wines to choose from."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We heard about Sorso from our Sales Associate recommending it while we shopped at Pottery Barn in The Scottsdale Quarter. We are so happy she did.  We happened to go while it was Happy Hour. We were there July 23rd. Our server, Cameron, was upbeat from the moment we arrived. He explained about the \"serve yourself wine card\" in which you swipe and pour your own wine... selecting from  a variety of amazing wines. For this visit, we went with The Happy Hour deal that is \"buy a glass of house wine, get your second glass on the house\".  That works! I enjoy a crisp glass of Sauvignon Blanc and went with Hay Maker, per Cameron's suggestion. It was a light but vibrant blend, chilled to the perfection! 
We perused the wide selection of tempting choices on the menu and it enhanced the entire Sorso experience with Cameron's enthusiasm guiding us, as we asked about several appetizers. We would normally order a Charcuterie board with wine (they have 4 variations) but we went with The Dip\" in a bread bowl on the Happy Hour. It has a blend of cheeses, tomato, basil pesto, and shishoto peppers to have on delicious toasted bread slices!  I'd order this again, but there are many things I want to try there.  I'm recommending Sorso, as we went there on recommendation. When you go, I hope Cameron is your server!"}
{"text":"Do you like wine? Do you like buffets? Put them together and that's what Sorso is all about...a buffet of WINES! They have a self-service wine area where you can get ¼ glass to a full glass of over 30 wines they have on their automatic dispenser system! Great concept!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I've been a couple of times with friends and would definitely go back. I've had the dip bowl and the  Americano sandwich,  both good and filling. One of my friends got a cupcakes which looked delicious and she said it was as well. I would suggest getting bruschetta and dessert. My friends also love their wine selection and blue champagne."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I really like it. Very friendly staff,  and they have a nice variety of wine. For the non-wine drinkers, they have a good variety of bottle or draft beers. If your in Scottdale, come check them out....you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had such high hopes having come here for the first time ...

We arrived at 9:32pm.  Our hostess/server told us the kitchen just closed (early) because the cook wanted to leave early.  We politely laughed it off having intended to come here for the first time for actual food other than a cheese board.  So we ordered a cheese board (one of the only options) and a round of drinks.  We then felt super obligated to leave at about 11p (they close at 12a) after our new waiter told a new couple who arrived at 11:05p that they were closed (they weren't closed and hadn't even called last call).  He couldn't get to the door fast enough to lock it behind us.  Avoid this place.  It has so much potential and character, but lacks due to an extremely under experienced and rude staff.  Our hostess/server was great but the waiter we were stuck with after she left was rude and extremely arrogant.

I've grown up in Scottsdale and have traveled extensively as well .. I understand how hospitality works at a classy establishment, but wow .. What an awful experience for a relaxed birthday celebration (or so we thought).

I would consider coming back for a second chance only if the owner invited us back followed by a sincere apology.

Wow, my girlfriend couldn't be more unhappy."}
{"text":"Great place to try different and new wine.  Fun atmosphere and low key, which is my style.  Super friendly bar tender who obviously knew what he was talking about as he was able to give us great recommendations and could pinpoint what we liked and wanted.  Fun happy hour menu and a number of bruschetta options we had were delicious. 

I haven't tried the wine sample card yet, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I tried the Brussels sprouts board and a few bruschetta. The Brussels sprouts were fairly oily and the bruschetta was just okay. The bread was kind of dry - so it wasn't as good as Postino. Sorso Wine Room is an okay option for drinks, but if you're looking for food in a similar wine room I would go to nearby Postino instead."}
{"text":"Whatever you order make sure you get some of the delicious bread. I will go back just for that. I like the concept of the self serve wine I'm a guy and I like gadgets. Getting to use a  cool machine while drinking wine is the best of both worlds. The costs of the sips add up very quickly and its a little pricey but hey its Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. We had bruschetta and charcuterie. LOVED the wine on tap!! So much fun."}
{"text":"Back again...THRILLED to see the place is slammed and should be!  Stillllll waiting for that second location \"down south!\"  Thanks for a lovely glass of wine and great vibe after long day of shopping....keep growing and thank you!"}
{"text":"Great little joint for wine. Totally affordable, friendly staff and wide selection of wine. My husband and I frequently visit here. The international sandwich is yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure it's the happy hour menu that made me instantly love this place. I stopped by with three friends for an early bite before an event. We shared a bottle of their house pinot noir, two orders of bruscetta, and the hummus place. There was something about the food, the wine, and the beautiful patio that made me not want to leave. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. I love the way they present the drink menu via iPad with descriptions of each wine and details on pricing. Definitely a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I was concerned that the staff here would be snobby since it is in the Scottsdale Quarter, but I was pleasantly surprised at how friendly the staff is.  The great happy hour deals and delicious wine and food were just the icing on the cake.  We got the bruschetta for happy hour and the build your own grilled cheese and it was all amazing. I would recommend this place (especially for happy hour when you're on a budget)."}
{"text":"Not just your typical dinner out! Love the pour-your-own wine machines that allow you to get a taste, half a glass or a full glass. Super fun & delicious menu of bruschettas - with gluten-free bread option at a minor extra charge. Limited menu with bruschettas, charcuterie plates, salads, sandwiches & gelatos. Very friendly service. Hip, swanky atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would deem Sorso Wine Room average and not particularly memorable. 

The Riesling I ordered was mediocre and the waitress wasn't very helpful in suggesting comparable sweet wines. The happy hour menu was also very limited.

When I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich and chips, I was expecting house made, actual potato chips. Not kettle brand chips still in the bag. Struck me as tacky for a place trying to bill itself as \"upscale\". I definitely should have clarified before ordering! The sandwich itself wasn't very appetizing or flavorful either. Honestly it's not any better than something you could get at Subway for half the price. Between this and the horrendous parking situation at Scottsdale Quarter, I can't say I'd be gung ho about the possibility of returning to Sorso."}
{"text":"This place was great! Perfect chill atmosphere, amazing wine menu and delicious bruschetta. Our waitress was a sweet heart, very friendly and they had a good happy hour. Would highly suggest stopping in for lunch!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the patio for a relaxing glass of very tasty house wine during Happy Hour! ( 2 for 1). Great wine for a terrific price. We decided to have an early dinner after watching scrumptious plates served around us and we were very pleased! Recommend any salad - fresh and tasty. Great service too."}
{"text":"I keep trying and trying....save your money and go across the street to Postino. I am so sorry, I just cannot try anymore. ok...it's been a while and I was pleasantly surprised; better chairs at the bar!!! The Mediterranean Salad was wonderful! I am so happy with the improvements! Their HH Chardonnay was always great!"}
{"text":"Happy hour- great selection of wines.  Laid back vibe.  Good Service at the bar. Had the MYO grilled cheese.  Was just \"okay\". Too much average bread- would have been better on the panini bread.  The bruschetta looked like. Winner.  Wished I'd chosen that.  Would return."}
{"text":"This may of been the first time I have been charged for a sample of wine. If I am going to be charged it would of been nice to have be notified prior to the server offering me a few samples. I just found this to be incredibly tacky way to raise the bill.

In regards to my meal's food the quality it was good once it came out right. Both myself and my friend had to return our meals due simple errors. Mine meal was corrected after the first attempt. Hers took two attempts and was still wrong, she finally gave up and her dish was comped. 

I have worked in the service industry for years and the main issue I had was the service. Between being charged for the samples without notification, the server notifying me the kitchen can't get it right due to a \"language barrier\", and the server pointing out my food is wrong and still serving it... I will not be returning."}
