{"text":"Convenient - tons of options - healthy - staff is always kind!!! Lots of seating area. In house soups made daily!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have something onsite. The staff is very nice. The food is good, but the prices are high. I've only eaten here a handful of times, because I don't have the average $10-15 a day to spend."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the menu is limited and does not change.   The pricing is really high so it's best to go offsite."}
{"text":"This place dummy lit. Walk into the lobby, was greeted by a balding middle aged man with the warming words of \"howdy\". He eyeballed me the entire time as I slid past the Starbucks. I knew this place was gonna be good when I glanced over a booth and saw a man the size of an elder orangutan casually chowing down on his entree with a pair of Beats headphones on like it was an everyday occurrence.  As I made my way past the rabbit food, I was judged by a wannabe Italian chef because I didn't show interest in what he had to offer. Even the don, Papa John, wouldn't call that crap he was serving \"pizza\".  I settled for the soup of the day, which consisted of leftover bacon from breakfast which was not eaten and various scraps from throughout the week. Another mans trash is another mans lunch. Seating was comfy on the 2nd floor where I sat.  I originally came for just lunch, but the show came free. Minding my own business eating lunch then BAM, QT3.14 hottie comes walking by to take a seat in the booth next to me, solid 20/10. Would settle down for life.  5/5, would eat leftovers and quest for future ex-wife again."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I am a UPX employee, and you have to be one or know one (hint hint) to have access....but man, you want access haha. They offer so many food stations, from healthy eats (yes please) to a make-your-own-pizza area. My favorite combo is when I hit up the Salad bar and fill up on salmon and greens combos, along with a nice warm fresh soup. They make four soups EACH day!  Another good option is either a healthy bean burger or their fresh fish of the day...yes they have a number of fish options!  They have to feed a lot of people, so its a lot of options to go around. Its amazing that they have such a healthy push at the cafe. I work across the street where they have a horrific greasy  fast food joint. Sadly most people on this side prefer the burgers they push out...ick. But at this Rev Cafe they push a lot of healthier options on everyone, especially as you walk in. As a health-nut, this is fantastic in my eyes, I wish you saw it more in general. It might give people the chance to see the \"lighter side\" of life and cooking. If you have a friend who works at UPX, and you happen to want to meet up for lunch, you will find something to eat, for a relatively low price made with high quality ingredients right here!"}
{"text":"Normally basic food at a normal price. Today I got a pre-made breakfast sandwich only to find a hair in my food. I just can't see me going back until I speak with management. #gross"}
{"text":"I love the Rev. It's quick, close, and full of healthy options. They are open for a good portion of the day and there are always affordable options"}
{"text":"There are so many options to choose from! You can get fish and veggies to fresh sandwiches . The salad bar is always there with fresh veggies. They always have a different soup of the day love when they have pozole on Wednesday or when they have Indian cuisine which is on rare occasions. I could eat here everyday they will always have something you like!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently terrible. When I get a salad I often find pieces of lettuce that are so wilted they a slimy mush. The chicken that I pay extra to be added to the salad is burnt and stale. The prepackaged foods are often expired. The wraps I have purchased also contained slimy wilted lettuce. The chefs table is occasionally good but usually misses the mark with weird food combinations, tough or burnt meat, or other food that leaves me questioning the health rating. The potato wedges are soggy and I discovered that it is because they are precooked and set aside until ordered. I recommend Lucy's fountainhead cafe instead. Time for a new vendor Apollo."}
{"text":"This cafe is at my job and I visit here frequently. For the most part the food is good but the prices are a little steep. If you are in the area and looking for a quick bite to eat ... this is nice place to grab it."}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe for quick hot and cold snacks or full on meals.  There are tons of choices for eating healthy and the staff is always nice and friendly.  The menus of daily specials and soups are provided daily to UOPX employees."}
