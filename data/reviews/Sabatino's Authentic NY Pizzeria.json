{"text":"This is my go to place for my cheat days of being lazy and ordering in. Delivery is always consistent, takes about an hour. They haven't forgotten any of my requests so far. For the pizza, I'm Italian so getting good pizza is a must! They hit it on the mark for Italian pizza in Vegas. Their wings are decent as well. I highly recommend this place. (:"}
{"text":"Ordered Alfredo with broc, it was tastless. they forgot my salad in the delivery, when I called for it, the girl was incredibly rude and kept going on and on about how she had to give me ranch and they normally charge for it. don't think I will be ordering again soon.

Update, just got a call from the owner. Incredibly surprised, definitely will give them another try. WOW factor on customer service! all issues were resolved."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the shrimp scampi with fettuccine and garlic bread. The pasta was cooked right - al Dente. I would order from there again."}
{"text":"Those wings!!!
I haven't had good buffalo wings in a while, sabatinos made it happen! wings made to perfection. 
I order the two slice and drink combo... who huge slices that I shared with hubby. 

The restaurant was very clean and the waitress was very nice!

I will be back!!!
 
PS: I gave them five stars for the delicious buffalo wings!"}
{"text":"Alas Sabatino's, you will be missed. But your pizza crust has been pretty darn tough the last few times. And it used to be so good! Someone must be over kneading in the kitchen. :-(."}
{"text":"I've dined there several times and I enjoyed it. I've picked up food and enjoyed it. You are correct... I should of called. I will adjust my rating accordingly."}
{"text":"Walked in and staff either didn t notice us or didn't care. Finally went to sit and they told us to wait while they cleaned the table. We stood there with no communication with staff. Finally asked them if them it was ready. They responded it has been ready. In all fairness they had a table of ten so that seemed overwhelmingly to the two servers. We left and won't return, to many other pizza places to try in Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Called and ordered pizza fries n wings specifically asked for extra ranch even paid for the extra ranch food got delivered we asked if there's ranch and they said yes we opened no ranch no sauce whatsoever not even napkins or plates called and all they could say is oh well wer closed if u ever stop by see the manager"}
{"text":"We love this place! We go a few times a month! The lunch specials are great! Garlic knots are to die for.... The eggplant parmigiana is the bomb! Sandwich under $8 and is huge... Their pizza is huge too.... The staff is always friendly and service is great! I have had the cannoli at the famous cake boss place in the palazzo... But sabatinos cannoli is incomparable!!!! They have mini ones so just need to save a little room!!!!"}
{"text":"My 1st time ordering from this place today and it was AMAZING! I'm originally from Queens NY and this by far is the closest match to NY pizza. My order arrived in the specified time and was hot and fresh. I got a large pepperoni pizza and medium wings all for $19.99 and it was so worth it. The wings were fully cooked and had just the right amount of wing sauce. I would absolutely order from them again. They also have great customer service and will deliver out of their service area for a reasonable fee. I'm located in 89166 and my fee was $5. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"My craving for a slice of east coast pie lead me to Sabatinos.  Like true NY pizza the slices I got were thin, chewy, crispy and huge.  Unlike true NY pizza, the sauce was flavorless and barely there.  Also missing was the greasiness and the convenient packaging consisting of a flimsy paper plate and a brown paper bag.  Aww the memories....anyway, despite the slice being a bit too dry for my taste, I give it 3 stars because of the joint's convenient location, the price (7 bucks and some change for 2 gigantic slices and a 20 oz fountain drink) and because in my opinion, it is the closest thing to NY pizza I have found in this town (or west of the Mississippi for that matter.)."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker who has lived in Vegas for 8 years. This is the first \"New York\" pizza that has lived up to the name. Great crust, sauce and cheese. With a little more oregano it would be 5 star. Service and staff were also very good. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and love the food.  Unfortunately last time I went to sit down and eat they totally ignored my daughter and I.  They looked at me several times and my daughter several times but nobody ever came to help us.  They helped other tables and even went to folding pizza boxes.  I'm amazed that that even happened.  Since that incident I have not gone back.  Maybe I will eventually."}
{"text":"AWESOME.  I'm from NYC and a huge pizza critic.  The pizza in Vegas is horrible until today.  Order the large 6 cheese pizza.  You will thank me.  NY in Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!  Best pizza in town, PERIOD!"}
{"text":"I just ate a plain cheese slice and a pepperoni slice from Sabatino's and I must say that I'm very impressed. Being a native New Yorker (Brooklyn STAND UP!) that has recently relocated to Las Vegas, I was very skeptical when they advertised \"Authentic NY Pizza\". 
Even in NY there are so many Italian owned pizzerias that don't offer the quality they once did in the past. They use canned, unflavored sauce and offer extremely thin slices. 
Sabatino's brought me back to NY PIZZA in the 90s. The pizza was oily, but that's exactly how I like it! The slices were VERY LARGE (again, how I like it) and the two slice special was priced well. I would definitely patronize this business for that reason alone."}
{"text":"OK Yelpers. This place offers PIZZA by the Slice. This is a BIG plus for me. Especially since I'm so busy at work. The Pizza has good flavor. If that's not what you're in the mood for, check out the other items on the Menu. I'm sure you'll find something you like. Enjoy. Oh but wait there's more. They have an ALL YOU CAN EAT menu (Anytime) & a Lunch Special, 2 Slices for 5.99 comes with a drink. They have my VOTE!"}
{"text":"I think we found our pizza go to place!! The pizza and 12 wings deal was prefect for my family, both the wings and pizza were delicious. We will most definitely be ordering pizza and wings again!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times now and each time the waitress gets my order wrong she has been rude when I informed her this is not what I ordered last time I ordered 2 slices of pizza and yes she got it wrong as well I asked to speak to a manager or owner she stated he's not available I would not recommend this place to anyone sure the pizzas are large and tasty but the service sucks really bad"}
{"text":"Ryan was a great server! We're never disappointed when we come in! The Wild White pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"love ordering from here! love the quick service, yummy food & the consistency of the taste. I always order the simple spaghetti and my husband orders the calzones. Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. The food is amazing, has a slice of pizza and a garlic slider was great."}
{"text":"I love the garlic knots here and the pizza is pretty good.  But most of the other food seems to be something that you would get frozen at Smart and Final.  I don't know if the food is all prepared on site but it tastes like frozen food."}
{"text":"This is the partner of Rocco's Pizza- which we have always enjoyed in Summerlin. Aurelio's used to be here and I am GLAD it is gone! The whole inside has been re-done and it is lighter, brighter and above all- CLEAN (something sorely lacking at Aurelios)!

We were greeted promptly, and our server with the golden voice (literally he has a radio voice!) apologized that he wasn't able to serve alcohol yet, but there was soda (even though some of the machine wasn't working) and the alcohol license was in the process of being approved.

We ate in and ordered the Monday night special- a 16\" cheese pizza for $8.99 and added some toppings on one half, and a house salad with their home made Italian dressing.

Our salad came first- typical house salad with iceberg, carrots, a few cucumbers tomatoes and some rather thick cut red onion (thinner might have been better-it was a strong onion!). Their house dressing was good, but not amazing (at least it was home made!)

Pizza was great! Loved the thin crust and the toppings were quality. Not too much cheese, great sauce and plenty to take home! It tasted very much like what we had at Rocco's.

Service was attentive and we were informed of some other interesting menu items we might like to try on our next visit. Water (or other beverages) were kept filled, but no one hovered.

Half way through our waiter informed us that he was also out of the home made canollis....but he also hoped to get those in this location soon. I asked him if he had the zeppolis like Rocco's and he did produce some! They were not fresh...when they are - they are divine, but points for trying and not charging.

Whilst eating, another table sat next to us- an older lady and son/caretaker. She asked for coffee (they don't have that yet), then tried ordering no less than 5 items that they didn't have (yet)! She was very frustrated....and I have to agree! It was explained to her that they use the same menu as their other store- so there are many items they don't have yet at this location. I think I would have preferred a paper menu that was accurate to what WAS available....not promises as to what was to come. At some point bring the full menu of the other location in- but it really is frustrating to order (or want to order) things they do not have. Even at 8 days young (which we all were reminded of several times) the menu can be set. Everyone understands kinks at a new place.....but that many missing items a week in will ensure people will not return or the place opened too early. This being a multiple location establishment, it isn't THAT hard to open it with a mostly full menu available- at least food wise.

Other than that minor irritation, we will definitely return! To have a full meal, with leftovers for $20 (with a good tip) was amazing! I welcome them to our neighborhood and hope they get the alcohol and dessert soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food, great service. I highly recommend the Stromboli. The portions at this restaurant are huge. So much food at a great price. Will definitely come back whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for a while and have slowly watched the quality go downhill. Not to mention the last 2 deliveries they forgot things or gave me incorrect items.   It's not about getting CREDIT, its about getting it right! I had nothing to drink and paid the high price of $3 for a 2 liter and they forgot it.   Tap water and food is disgusting by the way....  The food has been sloppily put together as well. The cannoli slider had liquid mush in it, not cannoli cream because they put it right into a pipping hot dough.  It WAS gross.  Seriously about to cut my losses"}
{"text":"when we moved to North West Vegas we wanted to get a quick lunch that would not break the bank. Subway is our usual go-to for this task but when we saw Sabatinos Pizza has a 7.50 Lunch special we decided to get them a try. We were not disappointed. Food was Hot,tastey, and filling. Salad, Pasta, NY pizza, and a Drink for 7 bucks You cant beat that. 

Alfredo Sauce is to die for it made from scratch i guess.  we like it some much that we make sure to order a lil no matter what were eating great on everything lol!"}
{"text":"I did have the manager of Sabatino's message me on Yelp and offered me a free pizza for my bad previous experience. We appreciated the thought and enjoyed the pizza. Though, I haven't been back since this incident. I don't think we will go again, but I will say they did try to do the right thing in the end."}
{"text":"It's a shame we're so boring in what we eat.  Every time we go to Sabatino's, we eat the same spaghetti with marinara sauce, garlic bread, and a soda (dirt cheap).  We always look at all the other good things on the menu, but always end up with our old standby.  In general, it's very good.  On this last trip, though, the noodles were a bit over-cooked and the sauce a bit shy.  Usually, though, the food is very good, so I still rate it very highly and recommend it."}
{"text":"best pizza EVER..this is our go to pizza place when we are craving pizza. We love the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Thank you Anthony for the great customer service!!! First time here with friends and brother and we loved it! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"How about zero stars?  Went there last night for the first time and got totally ignored by the wait staff.  Ended up walking out.  Very disappointed!  Maybe you should consider your customer service or at the very least just an acknowledgement would be nice just to say \"be with you in a few minutes.\""}
{"text":"Great pizza. I think the process are very reasonable especially when you catch a special. The dine in staff is excellent. The service here is second to none. If you're like me, and you want more taste than the chains can offer, Sabatino's should be on your plate."}
{"text":"1st time trying Sabatino's.  We were a family of 5 including 1 child. We ordered pizza, calzone, garlic knot and baked ziti.  Everything prepared exceeded our expectations and the quality of the ingredients used were fantastic.  Spending vacation here from Out of town we would go out of our way to come back to Sabatino's if in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This is an excellent neighborhood pizza place.  I have ordered delivery and carryout from here before, but never formally dined in the restaurant.  That being said, the times I have been inside, the restaurant looked clean and well maintained.  The space inside the restaurant appeared appropriate for the average number of customers.  The staff has always been friendly over the telephone and in person.

I have tried a number of the menu listed pizzas and the custom/orderer designed pizzas.  All the pizzas have been good.  The chicken alfredo pizza is excellent.  The ingredients like sausage and pepperoni are very good.  Some pizza places are hit or miss as far as sausage and this place hits.  The wings are very traditional american and well made.  While I have seen a trend for fusion style wings or exotic flavors, this place does traditional american style wings and does them well.  This is very refreshing since a lot has been called or is asked to pass for wings at certain places.

I have consistently had a good experience here and look forward to trying some of the other menu items such as the sandwiches and the other appetizers."}
{"text":"I only had the pizza delivery, so I have no idea what the place looks like, but that pizza sure hit the spot.
I had a difficult time finding any sort of menu to order from.  After an internet search that didn't yield a website (who doesn't have a website for their restaurant?), I finally called.  Not much luck there, as the best she could offer was to go to Rocco's Facebook page, but even after I wasted time there I couldn't find it.  I gave up and just ordered a basic pepperoni pizza.
Delivery was on time and friendly and the pizza was exactly the kind of New York-style that gave me flashbacks to my starving-NY-college-student days.  It wasn't anything gourmet, but I will definitely order again when that particular craving comes my way."}
{"text":"No issues with the food, but the takeout counter is completely BAD. I arrived to see two other people waiting angrily for their food-- they had been waiting for a long time and one of them had received the incorrect pizza, which was being addressed while her pile of other pizzas sat getting cold. I had to wait too, which wasn't a big deal. But given what I saw and heard inside, I had a bad feeling when I got to my car so I checked my order and lo and behold, TWO of the three entrees were missing. I had one entrée, one salad and garlic knots and two missing entrees. Good thing I checked. Staff wasn't surprised or apologetic when I came back in. I think there's a disconnect in the kitchen, coupled with some poor communication and a lack of customer service. I like the food, but it's not worth the risk of being inconvenienced or not getting what you've ordered and paid for. Sorry, but just being honest."}
{"text":"This place is lit!! The garlic knots are legit. Great place to take the family. Friendly staff. They always greet me when I come in. They always make the pizza, wings, and chicken tenders very amazing! They have great beers on tap. And perfect drinks for the kids."}
{"text":"Once again, this place cannot get their stuff together. I purposely call them directly so there is no disconnect with my order. If I order a steak and cheese with just (and I use that word purposely) onions and it is quite noted in my order history that I hate green peppers. Why do I get everything? Listen to the people on the phone!"}
{"text":"I have to brag about this pizzeria!! I had a party of 15 there yesterday, and they were more than accommodating! It was my son's 5th birthday, and they were kind enough to decorate the kids' table with the decorations I brought them earlier. It was all set up when we arrived after our activity. The food was sooo good! Everyone enjoyed everything! Thank you for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back to this place. 

Pros:
-close to my work
-prices aren't outrageous
- ^ those are the only pros

Cons:
-the tomato sauce clearly comes from a can and is SO bland
-pizza dough is flimsy and tasteless
-cheese pizza was dripping with grease
-house salad was bland iceberg, tomatoes, onions, and a few stray cucumbers
-salad dressings were clearly from a bottle and then put into plastic containers
-service was not good. we were not greeted at all when we walked in. instead, we waited, then walked to a booth on our own and a server finally came over. when she did, she was reeeally awkward. she forgot our drink orders. she left halfway through her shift and didn't tell us we would be getting a new server. (the new server was MUCH better.)

Again, wouldn't come back here. I wish them the best of luck -- there are things they could easily fix and be SO much better!

*UPDATE*
The owner of Sabatino's sent me a message apologizing for my experience. He stated that their sauce is made in-house, which I appreciate. However, that doesn't change the fact that it's extremely bland. He assured me that he'd speak with the servers that were on staff during my visit. I appreciate when an owner is involved and caring. I still wouldn't return to Sabatino's, however."}
{"text":"Excellent NYC pizza.  I'm Italian and lived in the city (not Buffalo or Syracuse or something) up until a year ago and this pizza would honestly fit right in there.  Extremely thin crust and unbelievable dough, mozzarella, and sauce.  Everyone pretends that they are from NY and the pizza places that they recommend are terrible.  If you know what good pizza is, do yourself a favor and try a slice from here."}
{"text":"Always happy great service. Eat here weekly if not more. Good specials. Pizza is delicious (I often ask for well baked though). When order for delivery absolutely always ask for well baked otherwise it's soggy. The prices compared to most are also pretty good the 2 slice special comes with. 2 HUGE slices! The salads are always fresh. 

Highly recommend to anyone in the area. Also the chicken wings are pretty good and there ranch is the best house ranch have had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"This place is very surprising. It's a bit hidden within a parking lot next to Tropical Smoothie Café, and the Cracked Egg. If you're extremely hungry and need food ASAP, come here. You can pay one price and receive an appetizer, salad, pasta and unlimited pizza with cold drinks. But, if you're looking for standard slices of pizza or a whole pizza, they have it, New York thin crust style. As far as service goes, A+. I was served by the woman twice and each time she was extremely nice and generous, and kept your drinks filled. Definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"We have become regulars here can't help but love the food and the people will always come back"}
{"text":"Have ordered here a bunch of times especially their marinara sauce, definitely amazing. Delivery is also great, fresh ingredients, fresh pasta."}
{"text":"I love Sabatinos. I'm usually always happy with whatever I get there. Their pizza is done well and their food is fresh. The only thing I'd recommend is to not expect consistency. The pizza you get one week might be a little different than the next week. I chalk this up to homemade, fresh ingredients, and the cooks having creative license. I don't mind it, though, because it's always a quality product."}
{"text":"What a great experience my first service was with Sabatino's. They were highly recommended by a great family, our neighbor and friends, the Roberto's. Bryan went through the complete menu with me and based on our family size and tastes, he made solid recommendations to us. Everything was very satisfactory."}
{"text":"This review is a few days late but I wanted to give this restaurant kudos for a wonderful job on an order I called in for delivery last Sunday 12/22. At the last minute I decided to order Italian food for delivery. Every selection I chose was amazingly delicious ! We had garlic knots and cheesy garlic bread and a seafood salad and another seafood dish (I think called Seafood Heaven?). Meatballs (soft and yummy) a pasta dish with chicken and sausage (nice and spicy ~yum !). Trying to recall what else but it was so easy to place my order online and choose a delivery time. The time I chose was 6 pm and the food was delivered HOT and ready to eat at exactly 5:55 pm. Very very satisfied !! Adding a tip to my bill was very convenient as well !!! I'll definitely be back !!! Highly recommend this restaurant !!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 drinks, fries, wings, etc. and one of the pizzas were not the pizza we ordered and we were missing a drink...

I know it sounds bad but it gets better. 

We alerted the man who delivered our food and he told us to keep the incorrect pizza. On top of this Sabatino's will be bringing the correct pizza, our missing drink, a dessert of theirs for free - and did I mention we got a free pizza out of it ;-)

Place is dope. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Walked in greeted right away felt very welcomed. My waitress Jessie was extremely polite & helpful. I enjoyed my visit and of course the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I have tried several \"NY\" pizza places here in Vegas and this place is the most authentic compared to pizza you get in NYC.  The pizza slices are fresh, saucy, and so huge you have to fold it to eat it...just like I like. I'm not sure if they deliver to my home but the service alone makes it a pleasant experience to dine in.  The staff goes out of their way and always reminds you of their specials.  The place is big and very clean and I can always catch a game while I'm here. Other menu options such as the wings and garlic knots are great too.  Id like to try more but the cheese pizza is my fav.  My son and I have been here 3 times and have no complaints.  This is our new spot."}
{"text":"i thought i was imagining that the pizza didn't taste the same until I read the other recent reviews. we always order the veggie pizza. yesterday i noticed right away that they skimped on the veggies & the pizza tasted flat. i also had issues on what was said over the phone as to the price & my pick-up time. The guy in the counter kept arguing with me & made me look like I was making up stories. He did apologize when he came out later with an excuse which contradicted what he said at first.  I wish I had read the latest reviews first."}
{"text":"Actually was on the way to have a gyro at a nearby establishment which happened to be closed upon arrival.

My son and I opted for a slice of pizza instead.  I thought it was strange that we were the only 2 people in the restaurant on a Sunday around noon.  There were 3 people who came in to pick up carry out, but nobody else coming or going during our lunch.

I asked if their gyro listed on the menu was available in only a sandwich or as a platter entree.  I was informed that they can't serve gyros because of the lease agreements the competitor has, but it's on the menu because of their other location.  First disappointment.

Upon selection of a couple slices of pizza and a pastrami & corned beef sandwich on marbled rye, I struggled with the way the waiter, who was obviously fighting a cough, continued over to cut the 2 slices from the pie in the counter, while coughing over his arm several times.  Although diverted from our food, I still cringed watching this.  I think asking his colleague to take care of this would have been a much better option.  She, instead ate a slice of the remaining pie off to the side of the restaurant while we waited on our food.

I was looking forward to a good NY pastrami & corned beef sandwich, typically served piled high on warm marbled rye.  What I received instead was a thin corned beef only sandwich on toasted plain rye bread. Pickles on the side, and the \"NY style mustard\" was curiously similar to plain yellow mustard.  Not quite what I was hoping for at the price.

Anyway....this was just a little disappointing in both service and food.  There are far too many options out there to even bother revisiting.  I'm sure their carryout pies are fine for the local community."}
{"text":"Sabatino's used to be my family's favorite pizza restaurant and we always recommended it to friends. Unfortunately, that has changed. Starting with a few weeks ago, my family ordered the #3 family special which was 2 medium two topping pizzas, 18 wings, 2 small salads and garlic knots. After we picked up our food and arrived home we discovered our pizza toppings were incorrect on both pizzas, we were given chicken tenders instead of wings, and the garlic knots were burned. After calling, the employee hesitantly and irritably offered two free toppings on our next visit and 12 free wings, even though the deal was suppose to include 18. The next week we called to place our order and instead of the free toppings the kind employee comped one of our pizzas. We opted for delivery this time and after waiting longer than the time quoted the delivery guy called and said he was at the wrong address and needed the correct one. Our food arrived and was cold. My family was hungry so we ate it anyways. 
Today was my last and final attempt with Sabatino's. I planned with my grandmother, daughter and mother during my mother's lunch break for work to meet here. We sat at a booth and waited to be greeted. The server passed by our table 4 times, no eye contact, no verbal communication. After 15 minutes of waiting, we got up and left. We took our business to Gyro Time next door and had great food along with great service. It's sad to see a great place come to this and I hope they can become the great family restaurant they once were. I gave 2 stars because the food is good when it is correct, not burned and served warm."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this place me and my son and 3 of my friends ate dinner here one night, to begin with, the staff was unpleasant, unfriendly and all 5 of us got extreme food poisoning !  I called the next day to let them know and they were very cold , uncaring and unapologetic. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, we will never return to this place. It's scary to think of what made us so sick."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so inconsistent. Wings were supposed to be well done and they were actually soggy and undercooked.  In the trash. Thanks.  Pizza was mediocre they use cheap cheese. Won't be going back again until they get some consistency"}
{"text":"Tonight I would be lazy, so I ordered some pizza.  I had never tried Sabatino's before and decided to give them a shot.  

I ordered my pizza in excitement over what will soon arrive at my door.  Salivating on my couch dreaming of that sweet, sweet pie.  

After some time of watching TV. My dreams of Pie started to fade.  I looked at my watch and an hour had passed.  I asked my roommate if he thinks they got lost.  He made a joke about my mom.  We both laughed, it was good times.

 I called in to check on my order.  The nice person on the line said it will arrive in a few min.  I informed them that if the food does not arrive soon I might end up eating my dog.  I love her dearly but a man needs to eat.  

30min later the doorbell rings.  FOOD AT LAST! I screamed.  I walk outside to collect the goods.  I ask what took so long? the driver didn't seem happy and he just said \"Here\" and sauntered back to his car.  No apology was needed.  I just wanted to know what happened.  He might have had to slay a dragon on the way over.  I'm cool with that.  Dragons are dangerous. 

As I walk into the house my roommate put my dog down and turned off the oven. We open the box in amazement.  PPIIIZZAAAAA!  It looked pretty good.  We both took a slice and cheered to our meal.

We took our first bite, looked at each other and frowned.  The pizza was not that good.  The crust was hard like wood and the toppings were greasy.  We thought that maybe we didn't believe enough.  It worked for Peter Pan, why not us?  Alas, we were wrong.  Happy thoughts and all could not help us.

It's been about an hour since I have eaten and my stomach is growling like mad.  It sounds like 2 Honey Badgers are trying to escape.  My roommate is breathing super heavy.  It might be the food. or that he is out of shape.  Time will tell.  If he is dead by the morning I will have to edit my review.  

I do not recommend Sabatino's as the pizza wasn't that good and the wait almost got my dog eaten by a crazy Mexican man."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout and delivery from here a number of times. The food was consistently delicious. Staff in the restaurant and delivery drivers were always friendly. The food was always delivered on time."}
{"text":"Ex-NYer here. Pizza was fantastic! I ordered 2 pies and one that came was not what I ordered. Called back and spoke to Chris, who took care of it, no problem. Had new pie pretty quick. Great customer service and pizza."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!! DON'T Use their Online Order Service otherwise you won't receive your pizza. First experience and last one for sure. Called after 30 min of not receiving my order and received the news that no one imputed my order in when receiving the online notification. They offer me 10% off, yup...a $1 and some change in another words. Are you serious? I get my pizza an hour and a half later, my order was $35 and you're only going to offer me a $1 off for your stupid mistake? They're lucky I even payed for it, only reason I did was because I had promised my son pizza. They're never sincerely apologetic, they're rude and don't believe in professional customer service. You're better off giving your money to someone else who delivers a full great experience and for better pizza for sure."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I used them for one of my kids birthday parties. Both times I have had issues, this time I asked for them to deliver the Pizzas to Gravady @ 7:15pm as the kids will eat at 7:30p. The pizzas arrived around 6:50pm (5 pies and a bucket of wings delivery guy didnt even say sorry when he could tell I was upset and I still gave a 10% tip and now receipt by the way) so needless to say we all got to enjoy cold pizza & wings. I guess shame on me for giving them a second chance. Food is good , but after this I couldn't recommend them =("}
{"text":"I've had the pizza one time before and really liked it so I thought I'd try carry out for the family. I downloaded a 50% off coupon that says \"buy a large or extra large and get 50% off the second one of lesser value\".   However when I handed it to the cashier she said the pizza had to be the same size. (I ordered a XL and Med). When I pointed out that nowhere on the coupon was that restriction she just looked at me. She was extremely rude to this first time customer. 
So while the pizza is about a 4 the service was a 1. I'm giving the benefit of doubt with a 3.
I'm amending this. The Fresca pizza is horrible!  I don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"The pizza is great and the staff is incredibly friendly!! I would recommend Sabatino's to anyone!"}
{"text":"Listen, the pizza is good. But they lost a customer tonight. We ordered the family special #3...great value for the money.  They changed it up a bit and probably for the better. Wings, pizza, salads and soda...

This time they remembered the salad (keep in mind the last two times the forgot it), but unfortunately our two topping Pizza  (bacon and pepperoni) only had one...no bacon. I don't understand how difficult it is to get am order correct. It doesn't seem to be that difficult,  the girl even repeated the order. Oh well...

At least the driver was cool."}
{"text":"got the Brooklyn and it was great. I used my coupon so I got it for a good price. It was a bit soggy so i popped in the toaster and it was good to go. i'm sure the soggy crust was because of the  amount of cheese and meat toppings that was loaded on. I can't speak to the service as I had chose for delivery. according to some of the posts  folks need to read the fine print, yes there is always a minimum deliver charge for delivery, someone has to pay the driver."}
{"text":"I have to say, the food here makes me feel like I am back home! Plus we gather for the NY Giants games, where there are specials and raffles every week. Stop by and meet with people from back home.  NY NJ in the desert is always here during the games!"}
{"text":"three words to describe sabatino's   pretty damned good !!!  Not to mention the service was outstanding and just totally happy employees, and customers....."}
{"text":"Went in today to order Philly cheese steak sandwich, order taken at 17:20, order cecived at 18:01. Sandwich was warmish and flat like someone sit down on it. I have been working as a professional Chef in (fine/michelin stared kitchens) all over the world for the past 14 years and to produce something like that in 40 minutes, something which should take no more than 10 minutes it's a crime in culinary world. Will never be back and will definitely pass on the message to all friends to avoid this place."}
{"text":"My last order sucked bad!! My chicken parmesan looked like steak and was the roughest chicken I ever saw. I couldn't even eat it and I wanted to call back, but I'm always scared to complain about food cause I don't want any pubic hairs placed in my food."}
{"text":"Wow...I tried to order a pizza thru grub hub, it was confirmed twice, came to pick up my order and it was nowhere to be found...walked out disappointed with no pizza. Second time I've had an issue with this place..and I really do love their food when they don't fuck it up which seems to be the usual whenever I come here I guess....just seems odd that I got 3 different notifications about it and it mysteriously wasn't there..."}
{"text":"The food & service was very good the pizza was just a little thicker then NY pizza. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The BEST Philly Cheesesteak & Cannoli I've ever had in Vegas! I ordered delivery from grubhub.com & the only complaint I have is NO napkins...grrr. I love Philly's & this has been the very best! The Cannoli reminded me of the ones we served at an Italian restaurant I used to work for. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I will not go there again it says all you can eat pizza pasta salad and the truth is it is very limited on the amount you can have, we had to wait a very long time to get service and the pasta was hard and under cooked and they  upcharge on the all you can eat pizza  cheese is the only pizza you can get with the all you can eat  I ordered pemme and she brought me spaghetti when I told her she argued with me about it"}
{"text":"Bad customer service.   We waited as they served people that came in after us.   Only half full restaurant. After a half hour we told the manager.  No effort to make it right.   Too many good places in town.  Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Very friendly and very reasonable prices for huge slices of pizza. Their ranch is also really good. Plus, the garlic knot sliders are good !"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. The girls during the week, in the morning are super nice! Which is why I come back but I decided to come late at night one time and it was the worst experience I've had there. I ate in and the girl literally left the pizza and walked away. No silverware, no napkin and never came back to check on us. We didn't even get a refill. I left so upset and somehow everyone around us had way better service. I called about two hours later so speak to the manager and honestly I don't think it was the manager she just said sorry and hung up. I just dropped it. 
After that I went again for lunch and the girl was super helpful! And attentive. It was great. She was so talkative and nice. 
My last visit here was OK. Except it was quite rude how I arrived and started to order and the cashier interrupted me and said \"dine in or take out?\" I said dine and she said \"have a seat she will take your order.\"
Umm ok I sit and have my order taken and everything was good. can't complain. But what really bothered me was how rude the same cashier was being to other customers. She was talking to another coworker about a customer on a phone order. And I could hear everything. She trash talked a couple customers. I found it disrespectful. And uneducated. But all in all. Personally I would only come to this place during the week, during lunch. 
This place needs to do something about the employees and their big mouths. 
Only reason why I leave 3 stars is because I enjoy the food. But customer service really needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"So....something's changed. We have been huge fans of this place for quite sometime.  The last two times it taste different.  The cheese, the crust, maybe both.  Just not the same great flavor as before.  We picked up the pie tonight and the inside is different too.  Menus have changed, employees have changed. Guess we will have to try something else for a bit."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are delicious!  The delivery guy Was very quick, friendly and professional. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch yesterday. We had both never been here. She is a former New Yorker and heard thru the grapevine about Sabatino's. Our waiter was Ryan. He was so friendly. My friend boasted \"I'm having the veal parm sandwich...let's see if this place is authentic!\"  I had the Caprese Salad and garlic bread. My friend was so happy! Sure enough...this is authentic New York."}
{"text":"We love this place the server Jeff has always been really nice and we come here frequently during our lunch break . They're really quick which is convenient for an hour lunch and the pizza is awesome a long with some killer deals for lunch . I love this pizza place def recommend ."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I think the employees need a lesson in customer service and they need to pay attention to their customers instead of texting."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza and service in North Vegas! Everything is good. For Pizza we get the Brooklyn! Calzones are phenomenal, crispy outside and fresh cheese every time. 

Try to come here once a month"}
{"text":"We were looking for something Good to eat for dinner on our way home from Christmas shopping and spotted a pizza place decided to give it a try...We are pizza junkies . Their menu had tons of options.. By far The best pizza in Las Vegas I can't wait to go back they even have cannoli puts Soho to a complete and total shame YumYumYummy..."}
{"text":"This place is okay. My group of friends and I tried a Large Everything Pizza. It was okay a bit greasy. Not to be picky but the cups looked a little dirty as well. However, it was a decent meal for the price we paid."}
{"text":"ok I'm a long term customer  its a saturday tradition for my son and I,   we got hooked at a time when I didn't have alot of money  and we ate like kings for very little,  and still had something left over to have and adventure after the meal.   the food is great, always well made  but the wait staff and owners are really what make the place  special.   friendly proffessional and always interested in the dinner having a good experiance....   I'm doing much better now and my son is now in his teens  but sabatino's is still an absolute requirement of saturdays,  

and definately get the garlic cheesy bread......"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to check this place out with my group the Las Vegas Pizza Posse, and I have to say I was really impressed. The pizza, the service....   FANTASTIC!!!! The pizza was that perfect mix of the right crust, tasty sauce, plentiful toppings and cooked up just right. A lot of pizza I don't eat the outer crust as it's usually too thick or too crunchy, but I couldn't wait to get to the outer crust, the outside was golden brown, while the inside was warm and soft, kind of reminded me of the fresh baked Italian bread my Grandpa used to get at the Napolitano bakery right out of the oven. The service tonight was first rate to be sure. From the moment we sat down, they took our drink orders, and served us up some of their delicious garlic knots. They started serving the pizza shortly after, and it was hot and the cheese was gooey, just the way I like it. The group favorite tonight was the double bacon, and there was a lot of bacon!!!! If your looking for some really good \"New York\" style pizza I don't think you'll be disappointed here."}
{"text":"had the best pizza last night. I got two of the biggest slices of cheese pizza. Bigger than my face! Thin crust good sauce and great gooey cheese.  Seriously, the size of the slice freaked me out. One was more than enough. Service was quick and everything tasted fresh. I will definitely hit this place up more often."}
{"text":"NY pizza without the NY attitude! 

I stopped in for their all you can eat deal. Pizza, pasta, knots, and salad. Their server Gene was very friendly and had a great attitude. Service was great. Now the food..... best NY pizza I have had in town. Better than Roccos and you won't get that NY attitude here like you will at Roccos. The pizza was perfect and the knots were nice and doughy. I've been back a few times since I drafted this review, and I'm still getting great food and great service from the whole staff there!"}
{"text":"Very rude customer service. Whoever is the manager is tell your cashier boy to not get into peoples business. even-though i was sitting and waiting for my food, this moron started sweeping next to me and he hit my leg. After a stupid look he walked away. What a crappy place."}
{"text":"We love this place!! We have been looking to find \"our pizza place\" for a year and I wish we hadn't waited so long to try here. We order for delivery and they are shears early, food is always hot and best of all consistent. We love the cheese pizza and the salads. So fresh and so good! This is our go to place for sure!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! A decent and reasonably priced pizza place close to home!  I had high hopes for Sabatino's once I heard that is was associated with Rocco's NY pizza - who my friends loved.  

Staff was excellent! Super friendly and even offered us free oven-fresh zeppolis the minute we sat down. Fried dough covered in confectioners sugar this early in the day?  Why not?  Warm and fresh!

Sabatino's has a ton of great lunch specials - including build-your-own stromboli and calzones - but we were here for the pizza. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza with a side salad which ran about 5.00 I think.  The slices are huge - with a crust perfect for bending in half and imagining you're eating at the counter of a shot-gun pizzeria in the Bowery. I liked the crust here more then Dom DeMarco's - thin, but with the perfect amount of toothiness.  No cracker-like crust here!

The salad was pretty much what I expected, the standard American iceberg salad fare with chopped carrots, red onion and a basic Italian dressing. Not fancy or elevated, but I wasn't particularly expecting that.  

I can't say enough about the staff, really. The gentleman, whom I assume was a manager or owner, was super attentive and immediately made us feel at home. This is the kind of neighborhood place that could easily become a regular stop."}
{"text":"I never noticed this place existed because everytime I've come to this shopping center I've been going to Tropical Smoothie or Cracked Egg. This place serves up hot and delicious huge slices of pizza at rock bottom lunch special prices. 2 big slices of cheese pizza and a soda was 6 bucks and some change! The pizza itself was great in my opinion, being crispy and cheesy. But if you ask the co-workers I was with, who are from Jersey, they would tell you this place was not authentic even though their name claims to be...something with the sauce to cheese ratio...I have no idea! I like it and I love their pricing even more. I will definitely be back for some more pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and staff. First time here took Jacqueline's advice great recommendations very good service and food"}
{"text":"Sabatino's is the most friendly neighborhood pizzeria.  I enjoy the atmosphere.  It is my go to spot for Friday night mommy/daughter meals.  It is also a great lunchtime break."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery today. We got 18 wings, a 1/2 pep 1/2 double mushroom pizza, and a small house salad. They said 45 min for delivery, took about an hour and 10 min.
Service- the person I talked to was alright. He was monotone and you could tell he was tired or just didn't really care. The delivery guy was awesome though. Made me laugh and was very kind. 
Food- the salad was just torn iceberg with an abundance of shredded carrots and sliced onions, 2 cucumber slices and 3 tomato pieces. The vinaigrette was pretty good actually. I mean it did the job but nothing to crazy. 
High-5 to the pizza maker. I asked for double mushrooms and definitely got them. The sauce was kinda gross though. Really acidic and way to much oregano. Maybe from a can? Not my favorite. But the crust was good and the toppings were on point.
The wings were the best part. Nicely coated and still a bit crispy. Even after an hour. The ranch dressing on top made it all come together.
For the price I will order again."}
{"text":"I've only ordered one pizza from Sabatinos and found it to be tasty.
Although I live ten minutes away by car, I used delivery. As everyone finds out, the contracted delivery services really don't work well, but that's all there is for most places and they're no match for the giant pizza factories (Pizza Hut etc.) or bicycles in NYC. So, delivery took an hour and the pizza arrived luke warm. I was so hungry, I tried it that way, but heated up the rest which made it 100 %  better."}
{"text":"5 stars across the board! 

This place is AMAZING! The staff is very friendly, the decor is very sporty NY sports. The menu was full and had SO many choices. The staff was beyond great, worked well as a team and made sure everyone's cups where filled, food was great.

We got garlic knots on the house, so good! The cheese pizza was great, crispy and a nice crunchy crust. The meat lovers and hawaiian wasn't as crispy but it was weighed down from toppings. They only used the best toppings, you can taste the quality.  The desserts looked fantastic, I wish I had more room to try them! 

The kids meal was awesome, my son was beyond excited for a pizza slice bigger than his head! 

So we got 2 slices of pizza, a drink, a kids meal, a hot pastrami and a slice of pizza for less than 25$ 

We'll never go back to eating papa johns, dominos or pizza hut again! 

** I wouldn't come here in a LARGE group, it's a small dining area.
Return factor? YOU BET!"}
{"text":"So I've been here three times because it's literally right next to my work.  OMG...I am a native New Yorker and this is REAL NY PIZZA.  Served by the slice, nice and crusty, slices literally the size of your head, and inexpensive.  I seriously wish they would open one in Henderson!  I am obsessed with it!.  If you are on this side of town, check them out!  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"What a shit show. Hire more staff. Where are the owners ??? The service  slow , food came out in spurts and not hot at all. We left starving and not paying for anything. Sad. My family's been coming here for years."}
{"text":"I was shocked at the food. I have had a lot better pizza. It was very plain tasting! Also I got a Pastrami sandwich that had next to no meat on it and it was on white bread that wasn't even toasted. The French fries were the worst I had ever had, they were so dry and hard."}
{"text":"the worst pizza I tried in my life, salty with no taste at all and had everything, pizzas of $ 5 dolare are better than this, I never go back to this place, horrible"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmyyy!!! So happy we found this place! Not too greasy and not too rich - just the right amount of ingredients. About to order again right now actually!"}
{"text":"I ordered online delivery, fail. Spent $40.00 including tip because I had no cash to tip at the door I prepaid. Cream cheese poppers and two liter Mtn Dew were the stars of my order, the soup was so so, the rest was a let down. Last time I ordered a month+ ago they let me down, second chance was worse. Ordered easy items so I could maybe get it in a timely fashion. Polish dog w/cheese and side of FF, hotdog, soup, poppers, cheesecake, Mtn Dew. Added $7+ tip thinking it would encourage proper service, NOPE! No hotdog, no cheese on the polish dog, none of the requested condiments, cold fries and luke warm dog, cheesecake tastes like it's been sitting in the walkin too long and it took an hour to get this disappointment. The poppers were warm enough to eat which is okay cause most of the time the scolding hot cheese squirts out and burns you, and the Mtn Dew was cold for two stars."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch-one slice of cheese pizza, salad and driink for $6.  The salad was just a standard iceberg salad used to convince ourselves that we ate something healthy before the calorie bomb.  The pizza slice was the size of my head.  They threw it in the oven for a few minutes, so the edges had crunchy, toasted cheese while the middle was ooey gooey cheese.  Quite tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have had Sabatino's on three different occasions, once dine in, and two carry out experiences. I have been pleased with each experience. I have seen quite a few reviews of those who have had bad experiences with delivery. I say to you, give them another chance by dining in. It doesn't sound like delivery is their strong suit.

The staff has always been extremely friendly to us. The dine in was my favorite experience because they gave us an order of their delicious garlic knots while we were deciding what to order (That's at least a $5 value right there). Their food can be a bit pricey depending on what you decide to order, but they have specials basically every night of the week that give you bang for your buck. We went on a Wednesday night and it was a large one topping pizza and  6 chicken fingers for $20 (you could also get this deal with wings if you wanted, but we like fingers better). Easy choice. Our pizza and chicken fingers came out in a very timely manner and was pretty delicious. I'm not saying best pizza and chicken EVER. But this definitely a staple in our date night choices because the food, service, and atmosphere make it worth going back."}
{"text":"Brian gave great customer service great prices and deals and awesome food"}
{"text":"Food was over cooked edges were hard as a rock... Usually we come here and it's fine but today Feb 20,2018 it was bad and the Owner gave attitude when we brought it to her attention.

Very u satisfied. If not fixed in future we will find a different place for this type of food."}
{"text":"First time here and we got the calzones. They were very good only complaint I have is that the bottom of calzones the dough was very soggy by time we got home"}
{"text":"I didnt really like them before. I found the pizza to be too cheesy with blandness of sauce. I think over the years they improved on flavor and I just learned to order my pizza well done so its not so cheesy. Huge slices and great authentic feel...they have finally won me over :)"}
{"text":"***update***
Owner called and apologized for my experience... gave me credit to try again. Listened to my concerns. 


Gave them another try....
I got the wrong drink, could the food be made with any less love or care.... slapped together sandwich, soggy onion rings... good thing I ordered a slice of pizza .... nope. That was cold and I am thinking day old. Plus I was charged a $3 delivery fee and I tipped my driver. 
$20 in the trash."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clean environment. The food came out in average time and the pizza and calzone was great"}
{"text":"I can only give this business two stars.  I ordered a simple veggie pizza for takeout and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes, a reasonable amount of time for a Friday evening.  I arrived 25 minutes after the order was placed, payed, and was then told that the pizza was not ready, but that it was \"the next one\".  I then watched at least three other takeout orders come out of the kitchen before my simple pizza arrived, some 20 minutes after the stated ready time.  No apology for the delay, no offer of  a free cannoli or something for my time, just a timid \"thanks\". 

The pizza itself was just okay, certainly not worth the wait time.  The crust was thin and chewy, not crisp, but a good texture.  However, it seemed to have been made with almost no salt so it was exceptionally bland.  The sauce was barely detectable except for an occasional burst of dried oregano; definitely a supporting player and not a star of the show.  The cheese was good, not great, but good.  The overall balance of toppings to cheese and crust was very good - the only very good thing about the experience.  The toppings were mushrooms, onions, green pepper and tomatoes.  The pizza suffered from the flaw of most veggie pizzas in that the onions and peppers were undercooked.  The mushrooms were sliced very thin and, like the sauce, often undetectable.  The tomatoes were good.

Had the service been better I could have given Sabatino's a three star rating.  I might go back in a year or so to see if they have worked out the kinks, but I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Could I get a slice of cheese pizza that hasn't been  under a lamp for 4 hours. Apparently  not here. Staff seems like they have no idea what they are doing. And they play rap music in a family eatery. Not recommended  unless you like rap and old pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the other night, they deliver straight to your door! The driver was so kind and happy, he had everything wrapped individually to keep the hot stuff hot & cold stuff cold. The food was presented better than any delivery I've seen in Vegas
We've never ate here before but will definitely be back! Thanks to Sabatino's for making our not so great Sunday great!"}
{"text":"They always pass out their flyers at the house so if I'm lucky I get them before blowing all over the lawn kicker is they don't ever offer delivery in our area."}
{"text":"My family of 3 has such different tastes it's hard to find a place to deliver something for everyone.  However sabatinos is as close to perfect as we will get. Husband and son love the 'za and I can get a salad. I can only give it a 4 because personally not a huge fan of the sauce...but if everyone else is happy so am I. Easy ordering on grub hub and delivery guy friendly and came in under estimated time!"}
{"text":"Delicious and hot! We ordered 2 pizzas, wings, fingers and the shrimp basket. Everything was perfect. Huge shrimp evenly battered. Pizzas were NY style and came fresh and hot. Wings and fingers were also a hit! No issues with extra sauces or special orders!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out a few times before-about a year ago was the last time and it was ok- this time had pizza and fingers delivered. Sort of like I remembered - not much flavor to the pizza- kind of bland. The fingers were good and were hot. But it just won't make me a regular. I was hoping for a little better quality. Oh well- it's still better than dominos or Pizza Hut - not sure if that is saying much though. Very doubtful I'll return."}
{"text":"Very close to NYC pizza, very close but not quite.  My boyfriend went to pick up my order and he was just annoyed with the staff.  He said that they were just down right rude.  I told him, that's Jersey for ya' ;)
He's gone twice for me to get pizza and I think next time I need to call for delivery so he doesn't have to deal with them or I'll just go myself once I'm out of the hospital."}
{"text":"Great food and the delivery guy came to my house even though we are a little further than their usual delivery area! Yeah Bryan! You made a bad day for me better, thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Well, when we started ordering it was great! We order at least 2-3 times a month. Then someone new started taking orders (Kendall) and things went down hill. The first time she took my order she couldn't stop laughing with an apparent co-worker. When we received our order it was not correct. The second time again, the same disregard for the customer. And again the order was incorrect. We let it go as we loved the food and thought well, new young people (as we have been there) tend to be into their friends and not into the customer service. However, the third time now, I'm upset! I order regularly and to get bad service makes me mad. I work hard for my money and when I have to order food instead of having the time to cook I would like what I asked for. I mean money doesn't grow on trees, right? 
I ordered again tonight as i worked late and wanted something I usually love and yet again, I get Kendal taking my order with the attitude that it was a bother to even take my call. I ordered a plain cheese pizza and 2 house salads. How can you get that wrong? Because I have an allergy to carrots (they create hives) I specifically stated NO CARROTS but, extra onions that I did not get that at all. When the order finally arrived I was displeased to see that my salad have extra carrots and no onions even, when she knew specifically (as she repeated it) that was what I wanted. 
I received my order incorrect, yet again (for the third and last time). I called and asked to speak to the manager who was Sarah ( who let me say,
 had the attitude as this was no big deal) so I could explain my disappointment. She as well, acted as it was no big deal. If anything, she was worse than Kendall. I let her know my concern and how upset I was and she had not one worry in her tone. I mean she said they would refund our money but, no feel of any loyalty to regular customers in any manner what so ever.  I admit I was extremely upset as when you love a place to order from and to be treated so poorly its disconcerting. Now, we have lost a place that we loved to order food from and find a new one (which is exactly what we will do now). 
I recommend you find a new place for food as the customer service (especially from a manager Sarah) to act and make you feel crappy as she did. I have no problem giving my money to someone that actually appreciates the loyalty and patronage. I'm saddened that I may not ever be able to order from them again as I work hard for my money and though I don't expect perfection I would like to be respected and get what i pay for!!!!"}
{"text":"This store occupies the location where Aurelio's pizza used to be. The difference is night and day.
Where as, Aurelio's had good pizza, but rude, incompetent people working there, Sabatino's has good people, but the food is somewhere between mediocre and awful.
We went for the lunch special, all you can eat pizza, pasta, salad and garlic knots, $7.99.

Pizza
Where most all you can eat pizza buffets have a variety of pizzas, here it's cheese pizza, served by the slice. If you want pepperoni on it, it's a dollar more. The slices are large, you can fold it over to eat, if you dare. Be careful this pizza is so oily there's oil dripping everywhere. It's lite on sauce, which I like, but there is no flavor might be just tomato sauce and oil. The cheese is normal. The crust has a chemical taste, can't describe it. I tasted it while eating the pizza and narrowed it down to the crust by tasting the crust by itself.

Pasta
You get to choose the pasta type and they put marinara sauce on it. Again the sauce is so oily, it's disgusting.

Garlic Knots
They were pathetic, the garlic knots at CiCi's are considerably better. They were missing something, oh yeah, Garlic. These were like bread knots basted with butter or oil, some kind of lubricant.

Salad
It looks like bagged salad, you pick the dressing.

This is suppose to be NY pizza. I've never been to NY, but I doubt this is what their  pizza is like, since I've heard so many good things about NY pizza. I had pizza from Manhattan pizza, I don't know if it's just a name or called Manhattan because it's NY pizza, it was good.
Save yourself a trip and try somewhere else. For the price, Graziano's is a much better choice, Round Table would have been a much better choice. CiCi's is a better choice than this place.

Update:
I received this from the owner. 
Comment from Robert H. of Sabatino's Authentic NY Pizzeria 5/1/2013  
'Once again...... I have many former New Yorkers who just love our pizza. Perhaps you do need to take a trip to New York before judging us so harshly :-)\"

Am I to understand, by your comment, that if I went to New York and had a pizza and pasta and it was the same, oily and tasteless, it would somehow improve my rating of your restaurant?  Let me clarify something, my co-worker and co-eater (who's Italian). the day I commented on, is born and bred in New Jersey, has eaten plenty of \"New York Pizza\" in NY, he also felt the food was too oily and the knots lacking garlic.  8 )"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from NY about 2 years ago and thank god I found Sabatinos! I love my NY pizza and Sabatinos provides it here in Vegas. Not only is their NY pizza great, their ranch is delicious and so aren't their wings... The only complaint I would have is that the wings are never crispy enough when I request extra crispy."}
{"text":"The Food was great!  The customer service was ok.  Our first waitress was great, but she was leaving so someone else took over.  I KNEW our service was going to suffer.  The only people there were teens that did not want to work.  One girl had a towel hanging out of the back of her pants!  I thought great it is touching her butt!  There was a kid that every time he answered the phone rolled his eyes like he was being bothered.  My husband loves the place, but after all this...he can go on his own.  I was so grossed out by the girl with the towel hanging out of her pants, it made me wonder what else is going on."}
{"text":"I love having their thin crust pizza with Italian Sausage and Fresh Mozzarella.  Overall we've had a pleasant experience with their delivery service with the exception of the last time we ordered there.  The delivery took over 2 hours and then when the food showed up, the driver was stating we had to pay when we'd already paid via credit card.  Good thing I was able to prove it with my online receipt, but the experience really made us stop using them."}
{"text":"After Thanksgiving, my husband and I went there for dinner on a Sunday, I ordered eggplant Parmesan sandwich, he ordered calzone with sausage and something else, well they forgot the sausage and the Calzone was loaded with cheese, ricotta, mozerella, no tomato or pasta sauce, I remembered Calzones from other places always add pasta sauce, but not here, also, They forgot the sausage. 

Thank goodness my eggplant sandwich did not make me sick.

Long story short, my husband ended up in E.R. with severe food poisoning. 

I would be very careful with the calzones here."}
{"text":"While visiting relatives in North Las Vegas, we Yelped \"pizza\" and Sabatino's was a mile away from our hotel. The server, Greg, greeted my family and I and immediately seated us (4 adults, an 8 yr old, 2 yr old and 2 11 month-old twins). While sitting down, the gentleman near us told our server that his pizza was one of the. Eat he's ever had! 
Our order: 1 Family Special that included 2 salads, dozen garlic knots, dozen wings, and large 2-topping pizza; daughter ordered Kids pasta with meatballs. I also ordered a bottle of Rootbeer, I believe it was from NY, and it was awesome. Everything we ordered was delicious! My 8 yr old and 2 yr old loved the garlic knots and marinara sauce. My wife and mom said their salads with Italian dressing were good. And everyone loved the pizza; thin crust, cut large enough to fold and eat. 
But our service was awesome too! Greg was great with our toddlers throwing things on the ground and getting whatever we needed to make the meal great. We will definitely go back when we visit our family again"}
{"text":"I thought I was going to enjoy it because of the yelp reviews, but I'd rather eat dominos than this place. The crust is just bad period. Cardboard sauce cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"I thought the cheese pizza was pretty good.

The waitress was pleasant and attentive.

Her dark haired male supervisor was totally rude and could be heard complaining about the customers.  He is not doing this business any favors."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 20 minutes for delivery, and received a cold, soggy, undercooked MESS of a pizza. I called the store, and was told no, I couldn't have a refund, and no, they would NOT be replacing my pizza. The guy on the phone was extremely rude, even yelling at me when I asked for a refund. 

He said, well, we're certainly not coming out again tonight, and you have your food, so what do you want? Um... A pizza that's not half raw, cold and soggy? 

Luckily, I had ordered from eat24, and was able to obtain a refund from them directly.

Nasty pizza, and even nastier people. At least own up to and FIX your mistakes."}
{"text":"1st and last time here, walked in grabbed a seat and waited. Server finally strolled over forgot menus. Ordered pizza and wings. Pizza was undercooked and barley hot. Was super slimy, cheese slide off the crust on every piece. Wasn't cooked long enough. Wings weren't much better, half were covered with the sauce and the other half were not. Will not be back! Go somewhere else, save your money."}
{"text":"We ordered the Staten island, a pizza and the chicken broccoli fettuccini. Delivery was 10 minutes early. The pizza was money, my wife loved the Alfredo but my sandwich was missing. I called and the lady I spoke to was very respectful and got the manager who was also very respectful. He verified I had the rest of my order and said he would have another sent over quickly. 10 minutes later it is delivered and even the delivery guy was respectful and apologized for the mix up. Will DEFINITELY order from in the future!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall my pizza was good, 3 stars because I was not offer any deals or specials for being the first time customer and being a carry out order. I also ordered plain wings which were very dry and crisp."}
{"text":"As much as I love writing scathing reviews it's tough sometimes to put into words how much I hate Sabatino's \"Authentic\" NY Pizza. I say \"authentic\" because I've been to NY plenty of times and have eaten at a variety of hole in the wall pizza joints and not even on my worst day have I eaten anything as tasteless and lifeless as Sabatino's. The pizza was flavorless, the crusty was chewy, and there was so much grease that I could've drowned in the deluge that came with tipping the pizza towards my face.

If you want to experience real authentic NY pizza go to Manhattan, but if you want a great Vegas interpretation of NY pizza go to Secret Pizza inside the Cosmopolitan. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"So glad they have new owners and employees! Great upgrade! Super nice & welcoming! Good cheesy pizza!"}
{"text":"Why on earth is a place this close to so many business and offices empty at noon on a weekday...ohhh thats why.

There were 3 people.  One couple and 2 guys each eating by themselves.  I walked in, someone looked right at me and kept looking at the tv?  Wow I know I looked rough on weekdays but geez.  Ok whatevs...don't make a show of it girl, they're going in the back to cook something you might want to eat.

SO-I orignally was thinking I'd just get a slice of pizza....ohhh I wish i had taken a pic of it...if this pizza was less than a day old...all the moisture was vaccuum sucked out of the area it had been sitting.  Have you ever puchased a pizza and left the uneaten portion out all night.  Yah, me neither #whitelie.  But it looked like that.

I ordered a calzone, which by far was the worst calzone I had ever tried in my life.  How, how do you screw up bread and cheese?  Have you ever had a bad grilled cheese sandwhich?  Even when burnt they're delicious!  Somehow they managed to have the dough overdone and the cheese was a runny ricotta and mozarella mess.  Marinara, tasteless and super greasy(?).

To give you an idea, I immediately ate a pepto tablet when I was done.

I don't think I willl try this place again.  I'm usually for giving people second chances, but this was so terrible, I'd just really like to walk away from the entire experience. 

For any of you that were wondering...I did keep it down. So there's that."}
{"text":"I picked a good night to try Sabatino's. I called in to see if they had any specials going on and since it was Monday, The girl on the phone suggested the \"Monday Special\" to me. Mondays you can get a large cheese pizza (dine-in or carryout only) for $8.99 (regularly $12.99) plus tax and $1.50 for each additional topping. I thought that was a great price to see if I would even like it or not so I ordered a \"Pepperoni Pizza\" for pick up. The ordering process was easy and I appreciated the great customer service the girl taking the order gave and going over the specials with me.

When I arrived the place was full of people so I took this as a good sign. The inside isn't very big, but clean and cozy. I walked over to the cash register and was greeted by a nice young girl who rang me up and went over the weekly specials with me while my pizza was being boxed up. She also gave me a menu to take home and look over. It wasn't too cold of a night so I asked for some paper plates so hubby and I could eat our pizza at one of the many tables I noticed outside on the way in. Plates, pizza and now drinks in hand we headed outside.

When I first opened the pizza box it didn't look that appetizing, but we all know looks can be deceiving and that was the case this time. The sauce on the pizza is really what stood out to me. The sauce was just tasty! The cheese, crust and pepperoni were good. I had some that was left over for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good, even cold! I will be back to try other menu items!

Pizza sizes are medium (14\"), large (16\"), extra large (21\") and Sicilian. 

They have over a dozen lunch specials, but here are a few:
-slice of cheese pizza and a side salad for $4.99
-slice of cheese pizza and 1 garlic knot slider for $5.99
-2 slices of cheese pizza for $5.99
-any regular sized hot or cold sandwich and fries for $8.99
-spaghetti with marinara and garlic bread for $4.99

All lunch specials include a drink! Lunch specials are currently from 11 am - 3 pm.

They offer delivery with a minimum $12 purchase and deliver pretty far out so call and check to see if they deliver to you.

If you are looking for an affordable family meal you might want to check out their \"all you can eat anytime\" deal. It costs $7.99 and includes cheese pizza, any pasta with marinara, and a side salad. I am assuming when I walked in and saw so many people, that they were taking advantage of this deal, but who knows. 

Tuesday and Wednesday if you buy any entree, large or extra large pizza at regular price, you get a 2nd of equal or lesser value for half off. Dine-in or carryout only."}
{"text":"Awesome service. I ordered a pizza to be delivered tonight for the second time in the last three months. Sabatino's is awesome they said they would deliver within an hour and in 35 minutes I had my pizza!   awesome pizza. I highly recommend this place if you're in the Northwest are in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Did you not read the sign on my door that said no soliciting??"}
{"text":"I have to give a huge shout out to Sabatino's!
Last night we ordered delivery for our family. Fresca pizza. Spaghetti Bolgnese and Canoli sliders. 
Firstly the delivery was 20 mins earlier than estimated but then came the customer service! Our delivery driver had been told that he had the wrong pasta order! Not only did the super friendly driver deliver our food to avoid it going cold but he told us to keep the wrong pasta and he would return with the spaghetti shortly!  We were honestly shocked at the honesty and willingness to correct the mistake. In a short time the driver returned with the correct pasta. Most importantly everything we ordered was delicious! Not a complaint in the house! 
We are now loyal fans of the great food, but their level of customer service went above and beyond! A lot of businesses could learn from these guys!
Thanks Sabatino's"}
{"text":"Stopped at gyro time this Sunday, it was closed. We decided to try Sabatinos instead. We ordered the Hawaiian Sicilian pizza, we r from upstate N.Y. And this is the closest we have had to pizza from back home. The service was great and the menu is huge with many regional favorites. We will definitely be back( did I mention they have veal ). Yum"}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker for 33 years  for the last twenty living in FL I've been craving a true NY SLICE  last night I hand the pleasure of going to Sabatino's. The pizza was great the server Bryan had personality and did a great job . My wife and I shared a white pie I'd say the best white pie I've had in 20 years. Next time I visit I'll be back  more than once . Thanks guys at Sabatino's ."}
{"text":"The pizza was a little (extra) greasy but other than that it was a good NY style pizza, will prob go back if wanting thin pizza"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place.  Drive by here almost everyday, get coupons placed on my door often, so we decided to give it a try.

After looking at the menu on Yelp, I have the restaurant a call.  Young female answered the phone to take our order.  I believe she said her name was Brielle.  The entire time she was polite, patient, and answered all of our questions.  We decided to order the Shrimp over Pasta dish, which was for me, and I decided to do the fettuccine pasta with Alfredo sauce.  For a buck more you can add garlic knots or garlic bread; I chose the knots.  My daughter and her friend ordered the build your own calzone with extra mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and sausage.  This thing was huge and perfect for sharing.  No one person can eat this by themselves in one sitting.  Also ordered some zeppoles, which are little bite size donuts which we went half cinnamon sugar and half powdered sugar.   

All food items were delicious, filling, and a great value for your money.  I will try this place again in the near future and get some pizza next time.  This place comes highly recommended by me."}
{"text":"Called in an order after visiting my mom at the hospital nearby, I've never been here before but was in need of some comfort food. The staff was friendly, kind and got my order done very quickly. While I was waiting I was offered something to drink. The kind gentleman walked my order to me and even gave me free Zeppoli's knowing that I had an eaten all day. Great place, I will come back again!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was very polite. Got the #4 Stromboli add peppers and onions. It was awesome probably the best I have ever eaten. The garlic nots were the best bread appetizer ever and I don't know where they get their raspberry tea but it was the best as well. This is my first visit and I will most certainly be going back. The 4 star rating was because of the ticket time. It was a bit longer than I feel it should have been for how busy it was. All in all I recommend this place. Yum..."}
{"text":"Huge sandwich was tasty too! Had the Italian, and couldn't finish it! The meats were real fresh, they tasted freshly sliced."}
{"text":"I love this place. I order delivery online which is easy and convenient. I love the pizza (all I have tried are great). I also love their pastas. It is right on par with any Italian restaurant. I LOVE the chicken piccata and have enjoyed others as well. The garlic knots are perfect and the salads are fresh. I love the dressings, my guess is that they are homemade. I recommend the Greek salad. I order from here any time I don't feel like cooking and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is our regular pizza spot. It's New York style pizza at its best!!! The pizza is always fresh and hot even when we have it delivered.  I have two kids that are very picky- yes even with pizza. They LOVE  Sabatino's.  When we eat in everyone is friendly and helpful.  The garlic knots are what happen probably tastes like.  This is a must go for pizza. They also have great black and white cookies!"}
{"text":"Food quality is amazing. 5 stars!
Customer service for the most part is fantastic. 4 stars! Why the 1 star rating you might ask...

They charge $2 per topping ($2.50 for premium toppings). That makes sense, you are the store, you make the prices. 

They charge $2 per topping for any size pizza. I order an extra large or a personal pizza, either way, I pay $2 per topping.

When I asked how that made sense (after already paying for my $20 personal pizza with out thinking about it), the cashier said that no matter what size pizza it is, they always put 8 oz of each topping. You get the same amount so you pay the same price. Alright, seems fair. Next time I will just buy an extra large and end up with more pizza out of it.

I got my magical billion dollar pizza to find that my $2 worth of olives was actually about 5 olives total. There is pretty much no way on God's green earth that 5 olives is 8oz. And if there was a way... It would not be the puny amount on my pizza. I am going to go weigh my pizza. With 5 toppings at 8oz a piece it should be a minimum of 2.5 pounds (not including dough, sauce, and cheese)...."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sabatino's for several years now and the food is always terrific and so is the service.  Last night I had dinner there with my fiancé and his mom and as usual the food was delicious and our server Jessie very helpful and attentive.  They have a great special with salad, pasta and pizza, an amazing Baked Ziti and a great Veal Cutlet Parm Hero among our favorites.  For dessert I would recommend the cannoli sliders if you're looking for something sweet.  We also do a lot of take out from there and they are always on time and courteous and the food is always hot!"}
{"text":"Who knew that this tiny place would serve up some yummy pizzas?  So happy we found this neighborhood pizzeria.  

Thanks to the yelper pics I ordered the Fresca pizza. I loved the fresh basil and giant mozzarella moons and tomatoes which laid perfectly on top of a light thin tasty crust. I would however request easy-sauce next time.

Spaghetti was tasty-ask for some Parm cheese if you get it To-Go otherwise they may forget to include it-like they did mine. Calamari fell short of flavor and I wouldn't order it again-presentation was lacking-no golden color looked like it wasn't cooked enough maybe? Caesar salad was okay.  Overall, not bad for a quick family meal if you don't have time to cook."}
{"text":"Another New York style pizza shop in Las Vegas.  This one is located northwest of Cheyenne and Bufallo next to the Tropical Smoothie.  I come in here frequently for quick bites, but do I come for the pizza?  No.  

I usually come for the garlic knot sliders.  

The pizza is the right size, medium to large.  When you walk in you'll be able to see some of the pies to your left and if it's not there then you can just ask for it and they'll make it in the back for you.  This is still worth a trip to come and try, especially if you're a New York sports fan (ahem player jerseys on the wall).

Since they opened the quality I feel as gone down, especially for my favorite garlic knot sliders.  The garlic and salt taste is no longer as strong as they once were on the knots.  They also have lunch specials that end at 3pm(?) but they're flexible and will still give you the deal."}
{"text":"I am a fan of NYC thin-crust pizza.  And yes, I've actually had it in NYC.  Sabatino's tries but their pizza just comes out OK.  No real complaints, but it just doesn't come up as something I'd go out of my way for.  

This is kind of sad, because I literally live 5 minutes away from the place.  When I have the craving for NY style pizza?  My thoughts automatically wander to someplace across town like Broadway Pizza (sorry guys).  That place makes an excellent pie.

Pizza at Sabatino's looks pretty good and for the most part comes out fresh.  But the crust for me just isn't as tasty as I'd want it to be.  I dunno, maybe it's just me and maybe my taste buds are just out of whack.  Either way, I just don't see myself coming here that often for a slice of the pie.

Sabatino's does have some decent specials, $5.99 for two slices of cheese pizza and a drink.  They also have a pizza buffet going on for $7.99 I believe that comes with:

-Cheese pizza
-Salad
-Pasta with marinara
-Garlic knots
-Drink

We had this buffet to give the place a go but was a bit underimpressed.  I mean, if you're going to offer a buffet, why only cheese pizza?  My guess is to keep the costs down.  I don't mind cheese pizza (when it's good and cheesy), but Sabatino's was light on the cheese.  The salad was basic bag salad with some tomatoes and red onion added.  The pasta was just penne with marinara sauce.  Their sauce wasn't anything special, I hate saying it but it's possible it wasn't made in-house.  The garlic knots?  I've had better.  Wasn't worth the money per person for their buffet.  I rather have stuck with $5 per person at the local Cici's pizza.  There you know you're not getting 'authentic' NY style pizza, but you get more choices.  

Service was ok, a bit slow but very friendly.  It's possible we had a newer server helping us out.  Restaurant just wasn't that busy on a weekend, it's kind of a sign that folks might think Sabatino's is run-of-the-mill.  

Like the look of the place with all the NY memorabilia plastered on their walls.  Just need some improvement on the NY eats."}
{"text":"When I came here I didn't know what to expect. But I heard that New York style pizza is really good and made for on-the-go.  

Nevertheless, once I tried Sabatino's, I was more than satisfied. The pizza is here is good and they give you really big slices."}
{"text":"My family and I have been ordering from this restaurant for a few years. Most of the time it's good but lately food and service has been deteriorating. We ordered a pizza and a sandwich. The food was delivered. When we opened the pizza it was cold.  We called to complain about the cold pizza. We were told that it couldn't possibly be cold and basically we were lying. The person who answered the phone would not give his name and was extremely rude. I will no longer order from there. Rosati's will now get all my business."}
{"text":"Old style Italian food.....fresh salad ....pizza habit forming. Mon. Nite pizza special ...can't be beat....everyone I brought to s a b a t I n o s..comes back for more.  My entire family..my friends love this place...just came back  from dinner..Sat outside with family and 2 young children..service was excellent..Kids had fun and we all enjoyed the dinner.  W o o h o o !"}
{"text":"Once we got the right pizza it was wonderful.  The driver delivered us the wrong pizza we ordered a Brooklyn and got a pepperoni.  Called the the store and they rectified it immediately.  YUMMY YUMMY.  We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"My family comes here at least every couple of weeks.  We feel they have pretty good food for pretty good prices. 

They offer 2 slice specials for lunch and honor them in the evening as well. 

The staff is pleasant every time and the only knock I have is the radio, although playing good music is always cranked up too loud - like uncomfortably loud.  Once we asked them to turn it down so we could carry on in conversation and they quickly obliged.  However, we are kinda embarrassed to ask so hope they get the hint.

Overall, we like this place and its in the family rotation"}
{"text":"Go here a lot good service and value for the money. Food is consistent. Will continue to to come back."}
{"text":"Once again looking at places near our Vegas home we came across Sabatino's, we really had no idea what to expect.  The place was packed and many take out orders were going and yet we were greeted warmly and quickly and were told to sit wherever we liked.  Our server brought us menus and took our drink order.  Fast and with a smile.  

We made our choices and as usual, with my family, substitutions and additions were asked for (thats what you get when cooks go out).  All our requests were honored.  

All of our food was wonderful and the service was even better.  So happy to know that this place is in the neighborhood and BONUS they deliver!!!  OH YES."}
{"text":"We just tried Sabatino's and were okay with everything.  

First off, the food arrived super fast!  We got it almost 15 minutes earlier than the quoted time. We tried pizza, chicken, and pasta and everything was hot.  This is always good with us because we are always down to eat!

The food itself was ok.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  The pizza was a thin crust style and a little on the greasy side.  The baked ziti was ok, but again nothing special.  The chicken fingers were pretty good, but tasted like most bar chicken fingers.  Again nothing special.  Everything tasted ok and will do if you are in a pinch, but there are plenty of other places in town with great food that I would rather visit first.

I also think the prices at Sabatino's are high for what you actually get.  Our meal was $45 and I think it should have been about $27-35 max.  I have no problem paying to great food, but this place is too high, in my opinion.

Yeah, so everything is ok, but not special."}
{"text":"So Sabatino's has redeemd themselves in my eyes.  In stark contrast to the sandwich I had on my first visit to this establishment, the stromboli I had on the second was a winner.  I was about to order a build-your-own three topping 'boli when I saw the menu ready eggplant, roasted red pepper and smoked mozzarella calzone/stromboli.  That sounded great so that is what I went with.  I also ordered Abita Amber beer on draught.  As I sipped my beer and watched whatever sports news show was on TV while waiting eagerly for my 'boli I was brought a bascket of garlic knotts.  These twisty little nubbins of dough were hot and fresh.  Not to mention delicious with their garlic topping and fresh marinara asuce for dipping.  These knotts alone were worth the second visit to a place I originally did not put much stock in.  And then came the stromboli looking all wicked good.  It was stuffed with cheese, pieces of red pepper and some strange looking but awesome tasting eggplant.  The eggplant looked batter fried rather than breaded.  Regardless,  it was good eats.  I ate two of the three large pieces of the stromboli and took the other home.  Can you say breakfast?  I'm a fan now as even as leftovers this stromboli was fantastic.  Plus the staff was great last night. The man serving the dining room has made a good impression."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Been our go to for authentic NY pizza and meatball sandwich for a long time (fiancé is from NY so is a must that we order the best) but since we just learned about new owners when we called in our order we questioned the guy on the phone about changes to the food. He assured us it's the same.  
No. No it's not. They get 2 stars because the positive is that I didn't have to cook and they delivered. 
Meatball parm was not toasted and pretty dry (no sauce). Meatballs were different and delivered in styrofoam. Prior to ownership change the sandwich had good amt of sauce, toasted and wrapped in the paper lined foil. 
I always have a small pie with olive oil instead of red sauce, pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese. The crust is normally thin, as authentic NY should be. 
Not anymore. It was thick, like frozen crust, can't be sure there was olive oil, cheese is not the same quality as before and let's not forget that it was cold. 
They used to be so much better than Rocco's but now they both are terrible and there is no good place to get authentic NY pizza that we're aware of. Apparently it was one of the cooks that bought the place. He's clearly gone cheap.  Sorry Sabatino's....we were regulars. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything is always fantastic and delicious.   They go above and beyond with special requests even if it means chopping up tomatoes!  Love this place"}
{"text":"This place has changed.  I used to love their food, but for the last couple of months the service is terrible, and they have got all of our orders wrong.  They always blame the customer for the their mistakes.  The manager is low IQ, clueless, and unwilling to resolve any issues."}
{"text":"Such good pizza and service! Ryan might be the greatest server ever. The sauce is the best and the wings are amazing"}
{"text":"As the previous reviews have noted, customer service is hit or miss and the location needs logistical kinks to work out. 

The order process: by phone it is easy as pie, in person it's the same. By Yelp's eat24 feature,... Not so great. This place is popular and typically the eat24 orders go last in line. 

The ambience: I've only gone on weekends and can say most employees are trying to deal with the rush as best they can but it can seem a bit chaotic. Pizza boxes stacked high, a thing NYC joints do to prepare for rushes; here it looks like decor (I hope I'm wrong). Also lots of photos of snowstorms back in NYC... Why be nostalgic about that I'm not sure of.

The wait: back in NYC waiting 30 min is ideal, but 50-60 minutes is the norm. In the suburbs of a suburban city, 60 minutes is outrageous, however it seems to be the norm here. Even when I ordered by phone and stopped by after the prescribed 15 minutes I still waited about 10 more. When ordering online it took literally an hour... Oy vey..

And now, the pizza: 
Cheese, excellent. Sauce, herb-y perfection. Crust: thicker than old-school city slices but crispy. All together it reminds me of today's slices back in NY. 

Overall I'll order again but on slow days and early!"}
{"text":"I tend to get pizza from here pretty regularly but the last few times it wasn't that good. The pizza has been getting smaller with each order. We usually get a large for pick up and the last few times the large has been looking more like a medium. It's a shame because the pizza is pretty good. If it wasn't for the inconsistency, this place defiantly deserves more starts. 
Oh, their garlic knots and provolone pepperoni Stromboli are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great place. Pizza is really good and so are the canolis. The delivery driver, Bryan, went out of his way to deliver to my house which is out of their delivery radius.  Even with the extra distance he made it here in a timely fashion and was extremely pleasant.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am from New York and if anyone from New York can tell me this is NY pizza, you're NOT from New York.. I'm so sorry to say this place is awful, the people are wonderful but I wasn't going here for a social party, I was going to dinner. OMG AWFUL, is all I could think of. Don't take my word for it, just go and you'll see just what I mean. People were ordering ate one thing and asked for a box, maybe they didn't want to hurt the girls feelings.
I was so excited to have a place so close to me, but I guess I am still going to have to travel to Metro for a decent piece of pizza.
Sorry Sabatino, your place is nothing like anyplace in NEW YORK!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"...since they didn't have their beer license yet, I decided on a take-out order of spaghetti with meatballs. I wasn't disappointed with either quality or quantity. and neither was my wife. The sauce was second to none and the staff was attentive. I'll try their pizza the next time."}
{"text":"Very diverse menu! The service is dependent on how many customers and servers there are, but overall the staff are very good. The portions are very large, 1 slice of cheese pizza is HUGE! It is NY style so it is very thin and even an expert pizza handler may need to fold it. The quality is decent for the low costs of their various food options. This location has removed some items from their menu due to conflicts with other restaurants in the strip mall area. But, they have enough alternative items to satisfy your stomach. Probably will eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"The food was great! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they forgot our salads. I love their ranch, pizza and wings were awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the \"all you can eat pizza is good\" however, if you order you own large/medium pizza I believe you wont be disappointing. I would definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Great New York Style Pizza with lots of flavor. Huge pizza slices but they were about to cut slices in halves. Also great friendly staff, felt welcomed and comfortable. Great family environment."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Super big slices. Cheese melts in your mouth  I have came to this place many times. It's awesome"}
{"text":"pizza, wings, antipasta salad, garlic knots.............absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!  ty so very much! my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see this place open after Aurelio's closed! The staff was warm and welcoming and treated us like family. They brought out garlic knots for us to try and they were amazing! Pizza is very good. Also had it delivered the second time and wait time was 45 minutes (normal for pizza on a Friday night) and arrived hot and fresh. We've brought 6 other people here and will continue to recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza for a delivery at 4:15 thru GrubHub. According to the confirmation, the pizza would arrive an hour to hour fifteen minutes later. After waiting that hour and 15 minutes, we called to see where the pizza was. They said that they did not receive the order from GrubHub until 20 minutes prior. When we offer to send them the confirmation that GrubHub said they received our order an hour and 15 minutes prior,  they declined. Instead of trying to fix the problem by rushing our order to the top, they told us it would be another hour and 15 minutes.  Then upon asking for a refund, we were put on hold for another 10 minutes and then told that they couldn't process the refund right away. Not very good customer service at all!"}
{"text":"Pizza is New York delicious as well as great priced. Took my family there and large cheese pizza is $13.99! Can't leave out the wonderful array of desserts that they have. Gotta try the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza(personal) 6 wings, basket of fries.  We were in a rush to pick it up, paid $45.00.   All of us got sick!!Then when we went a few days Later to complain about price and quality, we were told a manager would call.  Weeks later and NO call.  Not great customer service!. They just lost a good regular customer!  Now congrats to Rosati's we are regular weekly customers!"}
{"text":"Have only had the pizza which is very good for west coast. (Outside of NY) 
Sabatinos and Villa pizza are my 2 favs
In LV.  Not always consistent though. I guess it depends on who made it on any particular day. But it is always good and sometimes exceptional. Prices are about average. If you want cheap pizza go to little Caesars. But you get what you pay for. 



They're slipping. I can no longer give a solid recommendation for this restaurant. 
The quality comes and goes. There are good nights and bad nights. Hopefully you will catch them on one of their good nights."}
{"text":"Delivery took all of 45 mins. Not bad, not great. The Hawaiian Pizza has bacon on it...very yummy. But no olives available for my pepperoni?"}
{"text":"The cheese pizza with fried eggplant and onion was good but nothing special. Other reviews raved about to die for sauce but I was not impressed with the sauce or crust. There is much better pizza in Vegas. I would not go out of my way for this pizza. The reviews are overrated."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We got the Stromboli, wings and pizza. Our son loved everything too. Very clean and updated look. New York themed everything."}
{"text":"This place is killer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Got cheese pizza......amazing. Sicilian meat lovers......amazing. Alex was so friendly and welcomed us to the area. I'm hoping the pizzas are always this good cause I'll be ordering from here like crazy!!!! Must try!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and garlic knots. The \"all you can eat\" option is awesome too. You'll be stuffed with just one round of the salad, pasta and pizza slice."}
{"text":"It took 1 1/2 hours to get an online order delivered. It was New Years Eve, granted, but ordered very early in the evening. The food was cold and had to be reheated. We normally pick up and have had no issues, but tonight we tried delivery and won't do that again. Pick up has always been fine."}
{"text":"Tough night in the kitchen at Sabatino's tonight.
We order a 2 slice special, cant go wrong, always delicious.  But we also tried an Entree. Yikes?
The slices came out in 10 minutes,  a long time as we were the only 2  in the dining room. 10 minutes later the entree came out and it was cold. Not just not hot, but refrigerated cold. Back it went. Out it came. This time the bread was chilled. The very nice server offer to replace with garlic knots. You guessed it, not hot. The poor server was cringing.

We also order some to go food. The order was incorrect and took 30 minutes. Chicken Parm, wings, and a med pizza.

And the check was wrong. Tough night. My suggestion is go for the pizza. If you own the place, hire better kitchen people. They are hurting your brand. Good service in the front of the house."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from them usually once a week or at least once every other week! They have the best white pizza in the city! This is definitely our favorite pizza place! They have great garlic knots as well. I recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! The girls here are so awesome and super friendly! It's a hometown feel with amazing food! White pizza add garlic is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Wednesday later, we were given an estimate of 60 minutes. 60 minutes being the maximum, surely it shouldn't take that long. An hour later, by 8:50, still nothing. Called the restaurant, they said they didn't see the order w the name so it is on the way... Even though it really should be here already. Food finally got here another 25 minutes later, at 9:15pm. The delivery guy didn't even apologize, just said today of all days was very busy. Should not have taken 1 hrs and 25 minutes to cook and deliver one pizza, one cannoli, and one bottle of soda. 

The pizza itself was not bad at all; it was actually very delicious. But we will not be ordering from them again, unless we are not hungry at all and we have a lot of time to kill."}
{"text":"As my sister nephew and I walk in we sit ourselves as the sign says to do so. There are 6 other tables being served. We waited a good 10 minutes before even being acknowledged. Finally an older gentleman came to us and asked if we've been helped. We ordered our drinks first and waited another 10 minutes to order our meal. We simply asked for garlic knots and a small house salad to start off with followed by a large half cheese half pepperoni and sausage pizza. A lady brought my sister her salad with a small to-go size cup of ranch with no utensils. We waited another 6. Finally after getting someone's attention we asked for utensils and napkins. She brings us 2 forks and 2 napkins, remind you there are 3 of us. My sister begins to eat...the ranch only covered a little of the top part. We're trying to get 1 of 8 people we saw working there, (one guy in a green hat was behind the counter on his phone,) to let them know we needed more ranch and an extra plate because the lady only brought 2. Irritated and fed up I tell the her our pizza is to go and we got up to leave. I checked the pizza and of course it was only cheese and pepperoni. No sausage. I made sure they didn't charge us for it. Worst customer service I've ever had and I've had lunch here many times and have never been treated like this. I'll take my service somewhere else."}
{"text":"My rating is relative to all the other pizza places that have delivered to me, since I've lived in Vegas. New Yorkers would probably rate it 3 or 4 stars. 
Far and away the best delivery pizza (in my neighborhood). The best thing to get is the 22\" pizza, because the crust turns out to be the thinnest with that one. 
The wings are pretty good as well, and reasonably priced relative to other places that deliver wings.
Sometimes they forget my blue cheese dressing for my wings, but other than that, I really have no complaints with this place.
Oh, and I tried the calzone once, and it was also above average."}
{"text":"Had the food delivered, 2 stars for promptness, but yuck on the food!"}
{"text":"Aaahhhh quick recap - 

Pizza - not as good as I remember. Maybe it was too much sauce? Maybe it was the taste of the sauce? Maybe it wasn't hot enough? Maybe it was me? 
It just didn't cut it for me. I've been too spoiled by another great place down the street from me. No one can touch it yet in town. 

BUT...dem garlic knots. Simply delightful. Those knots are best bestest knots I've had in a long time. They're so soft, fluffy, thick, buttery, full of garlic and herbs...it's better than ice cold water on a hot summer day. I'm tellin' ya. They are devine."}
{"text":"I am a connoisseur of pizza both New York style and Chicago style. Sabatino's sent a cold, flavorless sauce and an overly chewy crust to us. I was not impressed. Their Greek salad on the other hand had fresh lettuce, tomatoes, plenty of kalamata olives and red onions and feta. Balsamic was flavorful but nothing spectacular. 

The fiancé had the turkey club sandwich with wilted lettuce and old gritty darkened tomato and cheese that was dried out on the edges and stale bread. It was a terrible debacle of bad ingredients and poor design. Sandwiches aren't that hard. Start with fresh ingredients and the rest follows along. 

Sabatino's will not be going into my speed dial for delivery. I'd give the salad a 4, pizza a 2 1/2 and the sandwich a 1."}
{"text":"Called in a delivery order. Lady was super friendly. Got pizza, garlic knots and Italian salad with house dressing. Everything was delicious. Would order from them again for sure."}
{"text":"Easy 5 star...here's why :

The pizza is awesome.  These are huge NY style slices...definitely need to be folded.  Crust is thin and yummy...toppings and sauce are good.

I am a HUGE pizza fan, of all shapes and sizes, and my entire life I've been a pepperoni lover...fan...connoisseur.  But after a visit from Sabatino's, my life has changed LOL.

You gotta do their sausage topping.  It is amazing!  It is slightly sweet, full of spices and flavor.  This blew away their pep topping, and made the slices.  OMG great!  See if you agree!

The other reason why this place is an easy 5 star spot....the prices are stupid cheap.

I felt like I was robbing this place.  $7.99 for an AYCE cheese pizza, garlic knots, pasta, and salad?  And no, this isn't some ghetto or nasty buffet style food spot (don't let the \"food showcase\" scare you away...they don't serve that food to us!).  It is an extra $1 to get toppings, and an extra $2 for any way you want em.  So for $9 we got all this food!  And yes, the AYCE is all day.

Since you already know how good the pizza is, I will fill in the rest.  The knots are pretty good, not mind blowing, but good.  The pasta is ok...but I won't bother with them again.....I have become jaded with excellent pasta from Italian spots in town.  The salads I didn't touch..but the company said they were ok.

They also have 2 slices + drink for $5.99 or something like that.  These slices are like 4 regular pizza place slices.  

Service is also pretty good.  The server was friendly and refilled and requested often enough.

Yes, it is worth the drive.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We had pizza, penne al a vodka and cannolis. Everything was delicious!! We can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"We just ordered chicken parmigiana sandwich, veggie pizza and the cannoli sliders. The food was pretty good, the sandwich was awesome. I don't know what they did to it but it was seasoned perfect! The marinara sauce is really good too, especially if you like garlic. The cannoli sliders are huge! Honestly, 4 people could share one. The order came on time but that suggestion someone said to call or just do pick up instead of the app was solid advice. I only knocked off a star because they don't use diced tomatoes, just whole slices and I think it made the pizza a little soggy.  Otherwise, great, I'd totally order from them again"}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from here. The food was okay,  not great,  but not bad. The delivery person was competent. No problems,  but nothing that stood out."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza twice. First time for an early start to new years eve. So bad we could not eat it. Crust was worse than one of those grocery store pre-mades. Crunchy without even being browned. Sauce was burned and over garlicy. Got our money back. Six months later we built up the nerve to try it again. Not so bad that I would feel justified demanding my money back but it was nowhere near up to the challenge of other neighborhood pies. Stick to the pastas that are not bad and AVOID the pizza. AVOID THE PIZZA!!!!!"}
{"text":"The aroma of Sabatino's cheese, dough, and oil is very comforting. My endorphins begin to rush while I await that first bite. The substantial portions are enough to feed one whole family for a few days, which the price remains adequate enough to keep me coming back. Their delicious NY Style Pizza is authentic and fabulous."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Took 18 minutes for 2 slices of pizza, and not one person came to tell me it's going to be a while. I had an appointment and took it to go. Then, both slices fell apart as soon as I put it in the box. There's more grease in my box then in my coconut oil jar at home. On top of that, the pizza was mediocre, at best. Thought I would come in and get a quick bite and... NOPE! Time guzzler here. Don't waste your money, especially time here!"}
{"text":"I love thin-crust NY-style pizza. Sabatino's is close to work so I get to go here/ have food delivered whenever I have a craving for a pie. I like their Fresca pizza (fresh basil, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese) and Everything pizza (sausage, pepperoni, ham, meatball, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and green bell peppers).  The sausage is terrific and the crust is crisp and not bland. They have huge pizzas: 14\", 16\", 21\" and bigger than that is a Sicilian. They have good eggplant parm and garlic knots. 

My favorites are their ham, salami, pepperoni and provolone Stromboli and the powdered sugar zeppoles...sooooo gooood!!! I can't stop eating them."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now so I figured I now enough about the place to review it.

Very clean and spacious. The atmosphere is bright and happy and has plenty of reminders of some of what NYC is about. I particularly love the black and white pictures of the city, old and new. One of the things I love about them the most is that they have pictures of other NYC boroughs other than Manhattan. Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and they may even have Staten Island. It's a very comfortable and colorful restaurant that invites you in and invites you to stay a while. The restrooms are kept very clean and stocked.

The service is adequate. Friendly, efficient, nothing to rave about but it works. Its what is should be and nothing more. 

The food is what gives this place 4 stars instead of 5. It's just OK, but for the price, it's good. You can get your usual two-slice deal here for about $6 which isn't bad if you're looking for a quick substantial meal for a good price. They tend to get a bit inconsistent with their pizza slices. Sometimes it's E 116th Street perfect, and sometimes not so much. The last time I eat there I couldn't fold my slice in half without it falling apart with is not a good thing. Other times the crust is perfectly thin and sturdy. The sauce to cheese ratio is excellent. It may be because they have different chefs but for the most part it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Only gave 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. I Ordered 50 bucks worth of pizza, wings (the smallest I have ever seen), and garlic knots. Waited almost an hour for them to deliver it.  Paid the $3 delivery charge and tipped the driver, just for me to not get the pizza. I called and had to wait an additional 45 min for a pizza they said they remade. It was cold in the center, and the crust was cold too, and the meatballs were nothing more than crumbled ground beef. Remade my ass. So the moral of the story is if you feel like eating cold food and wasting 50 bucks you should totally order from Sabatino's."}
{"text":"Back in October 2013, my Dad was in & out of the hospital nearby a couple of times. When he got checked in there late, he was really hungry and I suggested a pizza. Sabatino's was just about to close but took our order and delivered it fast too. I can't remember what we ordered now, but he hadn't been able to have pizza in a while, but said it was the best tasting one he's had in a very long time. He was a pilot and had flown around the world many times, so that's some high praise. I've been a pizzeria manager too. Their quality is second to none, and their service is excellent. My pops lived around the corner from them and we'd been in a few times before as well. Don't think about it, just call in your order or head in for a nice clean table, smiling employees, and awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Meh...I pass this place at least once a week and have been curious. I called in my order for pick up, they were nice. My order was ready when promised. Staff inside were pleasant. The pizza price was comparable. $17.29 for a large with extra cheese and half sausage. The pizza looked okay but it wasn't any thing special. I've had better in Vegas. The sausage was good but the plain cheese was kind of bland. The crust doesn't have that crunch with the chewy, airy bite that you're looking for in good crust. It was more a crackery crisp.
I doubt I'll ever go back, it isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Just got a pizza delivered from here and we were all extremely happy. They said 45 minutes...arrived in 30. Nice speedy delivery. the delivery guy was super nice. Brought it in the house for us. The pizza is out of this world delicious. We ordered the \"brooklyn\".....double sausage..double cheese and double pepperoni! NY style...8 LARGE slices. Fresh ingredients and really good. The three of us had trouble finishing. a home run!"}
{"text":"I'm quite torn on dishing out stars for this place.  Soooo, if you dine in they have a fantastic special  - for $7.99 you get ayce salad, garlic knots, pasta, & pizza.  They have 2 different guys that work here that are awesome servers, otherwise the rest of the staff is confused and annoying.  There is a female server who is 100% confused and down right annoying because she consistently got every order wrong that we tried to give her, forgot to put the order in, and frequently  interrupted our conversation to clarify her misunderstandings.  On top of that she talked really loud, almost as if she was yelling at us.

I tried to order delivery pizza and the guy on the phone couldn't figure out how to a) give me a the proper link to the menu or b) email a copy of the menu to me.  He then decided the best route was to have the delivery guy bring a copy to me, which ultimately took forever as he recorded the address wrong.  I was informed that the person I spoke with on the phone was the manager.  When I finally got to place a pizza order an hour later, I requested and paid extra for prosciutto.  When the pizza arrived it was adorned with common ham.

I wanna give this place more love, but if I can't dine in and sit in one of the 2 good servers' sections, then I would rather eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well... First let me start by saying NOT impressed. I was quoted 45-60 min, 90 min later I get my food. By that point the pizza was freezing cold. I'll eat it cause I'm starving but won't be back. 

Also I read all the reviews on the garlic knots and I am rather shocked. These knots were so hard, there goes 5 bucks down the drain, that I couldn't even chew them. 

I forgot to mention, I got a medium pepperoni and 6 garlic knots. With tax,tip and delivery charge.... 27.38. Bit much for hard dough, cold medium pizza that was late.


*******I have since updated my rating... The owner has contacted me to make this right. We haven't come to a resolution yet but the fact that he had gone out of his way to talk to me and try to make this right, SPEAKS VOLUMES. I haven't done many reviews since I opened this new account but have actually been a member(on another account) since 2011 and he was the FIRST to contact me and make this right. Kudos on customer service!"}
{"text":"had to return for more garlic knots. Bryan my server talked me into them with subtle suggestions. I don't usually go for that but stopped randomly a few nights ago starving.

I had to return for the garlic knots after having tried them for the first time earlier this week.  Would definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We ordered the Fresca pizza and the Brooklyn pizza with garlic knots and cinnamon sugar Zeppoles. The best pizza we've had! Prompt delivery service and very tasty! Definitely coming back and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Trying this out for the first time. Just ordered the Fresca and the Hawaiian. Love the ambiance here!"}
{"text":"Hands down the closest thing to pizza from NYC. I lived there for 5 years and the pizza is just as big, crust is similar and so is the cheesecake.  The staff is very friendly, the decor is all NY sports (and Giants are my fav). Good prices, pretty cheap, and their garlic knots that are filled are pretty awesome as well as their marinara sauce. Will def go back."}
{"text":"Very hard to get info over the phone had to call 2 times just to see if it was by the slice. Took 25 min to get a slice and a garlic roll. On a Saturday afternoon was a bit busy but everyone has already ordered. Decent environment good price, so the pizza wasn't cooked completely the crust was doughy under the sauce. Real greasy to be expected though. Had the garlic slider couldn't finish it took it to go. Ended up pretty good. Red head behind the counter is gorgeous haha but doesn't ever smile. Service was decent food decent clean store. Never go on lunch break. Will I be back ehhh maybe."}
{"text":"We ordered a hot pastrami sandwich and a cold Italian and we waited inside for 40 minutes. The hot pastrami was cold and the  bread was burnt!

Should have been a red flag when the guy at the cash register couldn't even tell me what came on either sandwich. 

Note to self, just go to subway next door for sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to for pizza. My #1! I always come here with my boyfriend and we love it. Pepperoni pizza & barbecue chicken pizza are our go-to's. 
Jeff is always there when we go, and he's the nicest server there is!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and got a confirmation that the order was received. The text stated they needed more time they were busy food would be ready @ 7:42. I get there and they did not prepare the order. Do not use EAT24 and avoid this place. Poor service and this seems to be a reoccurring complaint. 

Not a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"This place is a classic example of identity crisis. They would do fine just sticking to pizza but a while back they had veal parmigian on the menu and It was recommended to me by the waitress, she said all the pastas were amazing. It was terrible to say the least, an obvious microwave meal. It was floating in some watered down sauce I told my waitress immediately and they did nothing about it. I still had to pay for it too, no one gets a pass with these guys. There's to many places to choose from to waste your time here."}
{"text":"These people are ridiculous... 

I called in and some female answers the phone and says \"can I put your on a BRIEF hold?\" sure.. no problem, maybe they are busy, I've never called before, and never been there before, first time POSSIBLE customer... 

so this girl didn't even put me on hold, she just sat the phone on the counter and continued her 5-7 minute conversation with another female employee... then  some other customers came and walked in, I heard them get greeted, and then I heard someone pick up the phone (that I am waiting on to speak with someone to put in an order) and the phone gets hung up on... I literally waited for 5-7 minutes... then some guests walked in, and this girl didn't even check to see if someone was on the phone... she just hangs it up... like really??? did you not hear me yelling HELLO???? do you just normally pick up a phone, and hang it up? did you forget that 5-7 minutes ago you answered a phone call and \"placed me on hold\" so you could finish your STUPID CONVO with your coworker about NOTHING... welp... sorry, but I just wanted to tell your manager how sad the employees are ruining this business... and let it known that unfortunately their food probably tastes amazing, but I'm not going to be ordering it to find out.  HOW CAN YOU NOT PICK UP THE PHONE THAT YOU PLACED ON HOLD?! what makes someone think their co worker's conversation is more important than taking an order over the phone... like really? you should be fired. if you're that incompetent, you should just go work at walmart, they are equal opportunity employers."}
{"text":"I must admit that I was a little skeptical when reading some of the reviews. I have to say the food was awesome. My friend wanted pizza and I didn't feel like going out. I ordered the Brooklyn. Great choice!! I also got some wings and the zeppoles. Thats  like powdered sugared doughnuts. The wings were good. Let me tell you, I'm not easily impressed but this food was good. The pizza was great. The wings were good. And the zeppoles were awesome. I literally ate them until I couldn't eat anymore. I will be ordering from this place again!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Sabatino's multiple times, and I've never been disappointed.  Lots of choices, decent portions and you have GOT to try the Cannoli Sliders!  So wrong, but so right!"}
{"text":"I have never gone to social media to complain, however this is the first time I've had to resort to this. Hopefully the OWNER of this business sees this... This is not a friendly place I would ever eat nor give business to.  After my aunt ordered over $50 of food and getting home to realize they forgot one of her orders, she called the cashier who advised she didn't pay for it when we had the receipt in hand. She advised of this at which time she was notified she would receive a call back. After 10 min of waiting we called back and the rude gentleman said he was waiting for her to call back.... Why would she call back when she's the one waiting for you to resolve the issue??!! Anyhow, we finally determine that they would deliver the missing order which is less than a mile away. The food was then delivered in a bag with \"HJH\" on it.  My aunt brought me the bag and asked what it was.... well with one click of the internet, HJH apparently stands for \"Hand Job Honey\".  Needless to say I was furious!!! I called back and asked to speak to the \"manager\". Let me tell you, I have never dealt with a more unprofessional person. I asked him what it meant and he advised it was just letters they put for her order. I again asked him what it meant and he said it was just random letters.... SERIOUSLY???!!! What a \"random\" coincidence right? I then asked to speak to the person he reports to which is the owner, however the owner won't be visiting his store for at least two weeks.... WOW! I wonder if he is aware of how his business is being run. At this point, I can only imagine what they did to my aunts food. I'm almost tempted to take it to have it tested for any bodily fluids since I didn't let her eat it.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had issues with the employees of this place? Specifically Jeff or Greg. Don't be surprised if this hits the news!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! I will never go back here again! I have ordered from my home and business to ensure this place was successful. Now I save up the 10 coupons for the free pizza and then, and only then do they inform me that there's a $12 minimum delivery charge?! Never again will you scam me. Trust me, I deal with people all day long. Your business will suffer for this garbage. Guarantee that! Why is the staff not being told of these procedures, my guess is the owners logic is that it's easier to give the staff minimal training. What he fails to see is all these bad reviews because of poor management of his business. Not sorry to see your demise."}
{"text":"Im not sure how Im going to rate this place yet. The pizza is a thin crust NY style pizza sauce was kind of weak, no unique or outstanding flavor (good or bad) price wasnt bad but for the price you do get a whole lot of food.

We ordered the monster and at other restaurants they normally fill the pie up so you much you cant see nothing else. Here the toppings barely filled up the 2nd largest pie they make.

The grease on the pizza wasnt overly excessive but I did have to ask for extra napkins to soak it up on the two slices I consumed. This was telling me they were using low quality toppings.

The garlic knots were very tasty and the tomato sauce they served with them was bland as well but you could taste the tomato so congratulations I guess?

The wait staff was very patient with this being our first time and their menu being a cluttered mess of Italian food Im sure they are used to a million questions before a party is ready to order. I spent a few minutes trying to determine if this was a pizzeria or an Italian pasta restaurant? 

The wait staff kept or drinks full and checked on us throughout our meal without being obnoxious about it. (I did have to explain what Canadian Bacon was though and that just seemed like something they should automatically know)

The Angel Hair Pasta wasn't real Angel Hair(full size pasta isn't Angel hair) and the sauce was similar to the pizza and was so weak my GF asked for Tabasco to add flavor to it.

The decor is cool sports memorabilia and I was able to glance at a football game from my seat so it seemed like a cool place to grab a slice (they sell it by the slice) and watch a few mins of a game. The TVs arent at the best angles for all the seats so make sure you get their early to ensure you are able to get a good view of the game.

Its not a bad place to eat but I cant give it top marks and three stars is slightly too many."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . Pizza, chicken wings and fries . So delicious . I will definitely be back.  Normal wait time. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ and quite a pizza snob and since moving to Vegas we have tried MANY places claiming to be \"NYC pizza\"... AT LAST we have found a winner!!"}
{"text":"First meal in vegas and glad i did its ten times better then any az pizzeria that we have wild white pizza and teriyaki wings.. First the pizza sooo good white sauce almost tasted like a claim sauce but not but amazing !!!! Normally in az we get half azz attempt on making a pizza over cooked under cooked raw etc everything was done to perfection !! I must say that if im getting blown away from pizza i should also try 800?"}
{"text":"First experience trying this place was not so good the pizza was very doughy and I also asked for well done and got regular. No flavor whatsoever."}

Always able to order ahead and get fresh food at lunch time, working in the call center behind the building."}
