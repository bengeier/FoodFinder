{"text":"First off, this was the second time my party has been here because they have a large variety of foods. The place was not that great,surroundings wise. When we first came in we were surprised by the limited amount of food we were supposed to order. Before, we thought it was all you could eat but ow its three rounds and you get charged for a surplus. The red-haired assistant manager treated my party like dogs even though we had given an additional 15% tip. We come from the United States and we were charged for the surplus of vegetables! Vegetables?! I would understand if it were for meat but vegetables? Be weary of the red-haired assistant manager,he was very rude to my group and he was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Clean, all you can eat hot pot. 
Pretty consistent with the little sheep hot pots compared to the SF area"}
{"text":"Food was good but service ruined it. On the door it states it closes at 10:30pm,  got there at 9:00pm and were super rushed! We were made the pay at our table before we were even finished. One of the servers started mopping, placed smelled like bleach-put me off my food. The turned away a group at 9:30- why state that you're open until 10:30 when you're not. I told the host our feedback - she didn't seem to care, smiled and nodded.  Better hotpot down the street - kagayaki, with more respectful staff."}
{"text":"After a Hot Pot Christmas with my friends, we were craving for another session - minus the hassle of doing it at home. 

We chose this restaurant. I was hesitant at first, but it topped the Best Hot Pot Restaurants in Toronto on BlogTO, and I'm open to trying new places. 

First impression: great. Walked in and it looked somewhat modern and clean. Sat down and not only are the large booths inconvenient for a buffet-style restaurant, but they were dirty. The cups on the table were disgusting. Like they dunked the used cups in hot pot water and deemed it clean enough for another round of use. 

When we flagged down a waiter to take our order, he just looked at us blankly. My husband asked \"so, how do we do this?\". There was a menu (which was confusing. And sticky), but we needed some sort of open communication. We've been to hot pot restaurants before (numerous times), but we typically get an explanation at each place at the time we are seated. I mean, do we just get our own broth? Does the broth magically come to us? Have you read my mind and therefore not speaking? After his silent treatment, he told us that we either order \"spicy or mild\" or \"half spicy, half mild\". 3 of us opted for the half and half. It was only later (when we got the bill) that we discover that spicy is an extra charge. 

The food was okay and fresh enough. Though some of the veggies were slightly dirty. We got a second round of beef, which took long so we had to ask for them again. The second round of beef was severely freezer-burned and not edible enough after cooking because it turned dark brown and hard from only a few seconds in the broth. 

There were little-to-no desserts left (maybe four strawberry cake squares left). When we asked a waiter if there were more. He simply said \"no\".  It was only 9:00PM. So, I'm not sure if I can attribute that to laziness or under-stocked food, but either way they need to fix that."}
{"text":"Went at 5 pm Thursday night - it was hot out,  so not many customers, they brought the food quickly, the place was clean and had a nice atmosphere - 1 order of beef and it was huge!  They don't put sizing guides on the menus, so be careful not to order too much - I had the all you can eat meal - note that the broth is 10$ on top of the all you can eat, 2 meals with water came to over 60$.  It's a bit pricy , but it was good food, and a nice atmosphere , so was acceptable - I'd go back , but for a special night out"}
{"text":"Coming to this little sheep location for the pass 7 years. Decent food quality and price. Love the self-served food counter. Service sometimes not great, takes a long time to bring more lamb or beef. But over all is ok. We will come back."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 4 on a Saturday night around 7pm. The waitress told us it'll be a half an hour wait, we didn't get seated till much later (an hour later) and we had to share our tables too. The waiting area was FILLED with people and had very little room to move around. We saw people come in after us but got seated first. Oh ya, they also don't take reservations for parties under 6 people. I personally don't understand their waiting system. 

In the actual dining area the seats were really crammed and there was barely enough space getting through without bumping into other tables or chairs. It was hard to sit 4 people comfortably as the hot pot takes up majority of the table, leaving little room for drinks, raw food, bowls, and plates. 

Except for beef and lamb which are ordered and brought to the table, everything else is self serve. They had a fair variety of veggies, fish balls, noodles, and seafood but very little meat selections.   The sauce bar was good with a selection of various sauces: soy sauce, peanut, crushed garlic, etc. 

The atmosphere was welcoming and good. However the place was very slippery and the bathrooms were a joke. The floors were flooded and my friend actually slipped thus hurting himself. 

Pros: A decent place with a fair selection of food and broths are good. Servers are quick, only you need to get the attention of one whenever you need something. 
Cons: Wait times are beyond ridiculous, crammed seatings, nasty washrooms and slippery floors. 

Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Terrible! It was the nastiest meal I've ever eaten! All the food there was frozen.  The broth smelled off. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"There's not that big of a selection of food. The quality wasn't that great. Some of the food that was ordered didn't come but the waiter did apologize and bring it so it wasn't too bad. A friend came as his first hotpot experience so it was pretty disappointing since I've had much better but it's alright if you're craving hot pot."}
{"text":"The Brossard location has better (re: friendlier & professional) service for the same food at the same price.  Plus parking is a no brainer in the south shore. Wait staff here don't speak French, passable English, fluent Mandarin, no Cantonese or other Asian dialect.  

All you can eat seafood hotpot special for $20.99 on Friday ....choose from spicy or not spicy broth to share or have your own individual pot. Good decor & clean for a Chinatown establishment.  It's self serve, except for the stuff you pick from their ordering menu. Really. You need to fill your own water glass & get your little bowl of soy sauce. No soy sauce bottles at each table :("}
{"text":"Good quality fresh veggies.  Friendly service.  The place is clean.  We had the half spicy and half regular soup base for $5, and both bases were delicious and flavourful.  

The plum juice was definitely watered down. Free but kinda gross.  

The bill comes to about $60 for two people at dinner with the half/half soup base."}
{"text":"Very traditional Chinese hot pot, raw materials are fresh, and many options for all you can eat, reasonable price, good place! It is a little bit far, anyway, I would want to visit there again."}
{"text":"the seasoning sauce really sucks, tastes like water. food choices is ok. wont come back again."}
{"text":"My favourite hot pot place to go in Mississauga. 
They only have 2 types of soup, wished they had more varieties. Other than that it's all you can eat, the service is good they seem to bring everything you need and never miss any item."}
{"text":"Very dirty place, if you pay just a little bit attention, you will want to stop eating immediately. Serving utensils fell on the ground and was picked up and put back...  sauce area is not sneeze protected and each sauce was cross contaminated... servers put back food, using bare hands, after it fell out of the plate - each and every time. Staff sneezed into hands and continue to serve raw food. The staff does not care about food hygiene at all. Seriously the worst practices I have witnessed."}
{"text":"Nice experience. The food was fresh. We took the spicy hot pot. We really enjoyed the lamb meat and the shrimp balls. They also have braised beef chops which are delicious. Overall great food, great service and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to many hot pots and this was a very different one than I am used to going to. Located in Montreal's China Town, we were taken for a little tour in the dirtiest part of the city (and this city is probably the cleanest city Ive been to). You could instantly recognize that this was a hot spot by the many people flocking in and out of the establishment. 

The first thing I liked about this style of hot pot is that its buffet. Unlike most hot pots where they serve you a certain selection of veggies that they hand picked for you, you get to choose exactly what vegetables and how much you want to put in your pot. That being said, I am not really sure how fresh the veggies are being displayed open deli style right near their front entrance. Hordes of children and families were running around using their hands when utensils were not readily available and I did not see one staff member come out to replace stale food. 
We were told that we HAD to order the beef/lamb combo (I don't eat lamb) which left my boyfriend having to eat the whole dish. This wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't see the sign on the table that said if we wasted 200 grams of food, we would be charged another 15,99$ So basically, he filled up on food he didn't want just so I could eat the food I did want. I was not very happy about that but he seemed to be okay with it. 

Overall, I would have given this 2 stars because it wasn't that fantastic. I gave it a 3 because if you enjoy hot pots like I do, this is something you will want to experience regardless."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first hot pot style meal ever here.  It was fresh, very tasty and authentic.  We felt like we were dining in Asia as everything seemed so different and authentic from Chinese meals we have had back home."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 16 friends to celebrate a birthday. They had 2 large tables reserved for us. I was surprisingly surprised of the quality of the food and the waiters' customer service. 

Majority of the food are self serve where you grab everything off trays of food onto your plate to cook. There is also unlimited pop drinks and soy milk included in the meal.  The self serve food includes your typical veges, squid, assortment of balls (only the lamb balls looked home made), pork slices, wonton, tripe, pork stomach, fish cakes.  The sauces are also self serve which includes: bbq, satay, sesame, seafood, and freshly cut green onions and cilantro. 

The beef and lamb slices are ordered from the waiters and were given to us promptly. 

I had the spicy broth that I really enjoyed. It had a very strong flavour that burst into my mouth with every bite I took. The flavour was strong enough that I would have been able to survive without any sauces. I have been to many hotpot places and have found that their soup base had a strong aroma but ended up with a weird aftertaste.  Little sheep soup base did not give me this problem.

The waiters were also good with us keeping a birthday cake in their fridge. 

Overall, it was a great night with great friends and great food."}
{"text":"Their lamb smells gamey.. But I can't complain about the rest. Squid is tricky to cook. Can get tough easily. I took the least spicy broth and the hubby took the spicy. They serve you unlimited food at the table but you have to get up for water.. Or maybe the waiter wasn't serving us. Can't remember too much about the rest, it was a while ago but I remember it being a bit pricey... Around 50$-60$ for 2 people. Was fun but I could have went for pho for 9$ and had a full meal. The experience is fun tho so try it once in your life."}
{"text":"Food: Beware, this is an AYCE, therefore, expect an AYCE quality. The lamb meat are usually good but the quality of the other items vary greatly although they have a lot of choice on the menu. It happens you will find your vegetables unwashed or not even cut... My advice, stick to safe pre-made/packed items like tofu. At the self serve sauce bar, you can find and mix your condiments for the dipping but I must say I've never seen sesame paste diluted to water-like texture and yes I've been to other restaurants of the same chain in other cities in NA and they are NOT like this...

Service: Service is usually fast except when it gets busy, then forget about round 2-3, will unlikely get to you~ Side note, often wrong items are brought to you even during quite hours... - -\"

Price: Expensive for the quality of the food

Ambiance: Good lighting and space between tables, can become quite crowded at night. Poor ventilation system, especially when it's full, feels like we are eating in a mist hihi~"}
{"text":"Delicious hot pot. It's buffet style and you can get your own food. I prefer this over menu just because you can check the actual food instead. 

We sometimes make hot pot at home and buy both the meat and the sauce from here too."}
{"text":"I found insects in my soup after putting the veggies to cook. The server offered me a new pot of soup but never replaced those dirty veggies on the counter. Clearly, they didn't rinse the veggies properly before putting out there. I regret that I didn't get a chance to take photos. 

One of the staffs was very unfriendly. I mean what's with the grumpy face and throwing plates on the table? It's like he didn't want to serve any of the customer. The service was a disgrace. Will never come back here again. I'd rather go all the way to downtown location. 

For those who go here, please be careful with their veggies."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible.
Got seated and then waited an hour for cutlery, food, hot pot 

Food ordered never showed up 

Staff seemed to be intentionally ignoring our group - a nice couple at the table next to us flagged down staff for us"}
{"text":"Food is good but it is too overpriced. Prices are not upfront. Too many hidden costs. You have to pay for tea, drink, soup etc. Even the 20%  tips were  added into the bill regardless their level of service.  Final bill is at least $35 to $40 or more per person. With this price, you can get much better food and variety in Mississauga or Toronto. Will not recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I'm craving hot pot!! Their service is super nice and the meat is really good quality! I recommend eating the dinner menu as there are lots of stuff to choose from and the difference is only 4 dollars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gives you a choice of broths (we chose spicy) along with very thinly sliced beef and lamb to cook at the table.  You are also able to go to a large buffet area and select other items to cook in the broth.  The range is pretty broad - broccoli, pumpkin, taro, potato, cabbage, \"luncheon meat\", noodles, rice cakes, shrimp, crab, mushrooms, etc.  We would have liked to try chicken, but they were only offering chicken hearts and gizzards and we weren't feeling that adventurous.

The service was friendly and prompt.  We'd read that the waits can be long but we showed up at 9:15 on a Saturday and only had to wait 15 minutes.  Although the website lists closing time as 11:30, they made a last call for the buffet around 10:15."}
{"text":"I would give it three and a half stars. My first hot pot. It was interesting and different but I can't see myself doing this very often. The servers were very helpful because I felt completely lost with what to do or how to order. Anyway, we got beef and lamb and a bunch of veggies, then one server encouraged me to take some fish. The broths are non-spicy and a spicy (with lots of chilies and sichuan peppercorns - would be fun to do with a group. Just beware - it cost me a lot more than I expected by the time you added in the soup base, the tax, and the gratuity. Bring an appetite so you make it worth it."}
{"text":"Where to start?! Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is an amazing restaurant for any occasion, the choices in the buffet are broad, waiters are nice and will not take time to bring you what you ask, it's a very interesting style of buffet (won't spoil the surprise for you!) and it's a very nice atmosphere for all occasions. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I came to this restaurant. It is a hot pot buffet restaurant, so you can eat as much as you can. We did not eat that much though. The lamb and beef were good. The downside of eating here was the clothes were full of hot pot smell. It would be better if they could supply cloth covers like commonly seen in hot pot restaurants."}
{"text":"We found the concept really original and we recommand it for an unusual dining experience. The food is fresh and the place is clean. Our only deception: they were out of sweet buns and didn't seem so willing to refill since it was 1h before closing."}
{"text":"My BF and I went on a Sunday evening and it was very busy and hard to find a server to get extra plates or to help with the heating element (we found it difficult to control the level of heat). We got the spicy broth, which I liked but my BF found too spicy. They have a good selection of vegetables, etc. from the buffet wall and they refill regularly. Drinks from the fountains are also included. 

We didn't find the experience all that enjoyable. Having a boiling pot blowing steam in your face all night is not so much fun, and everything tastes the same after awhile. Plus, it was pretty expensive at $50 for two people -- especially since you have to do all the cooking yourself! We came to the conclusion that if you like the idea of hotpot, it is worth checking out once, but personally, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I wasn't really interested in trying this restaurant at first because the price is a little high, $23.99 for an adult and you have to pay $10.99 for the soup base. Additionally, it's not technically all you can eat because you can only order 2 rounds of food. That being said my foodie friend recommended this place to me so I had to try it. 

They don't offer as much variety as 1 pot and all the ready to eat food is an additional cost. Even though there wasn't as much variety the quality of the food was really good. The fish balls and meat balls etc are all freshly made in house.  I like the Szechuan style kimchi it's quite tasty and refreshing. The soup bases were good and it was similar to some of the soup bases I've had in Taiwan but the spicy soup base wasn't spicy.

The kitchen staff didn't seem to care about portion sizes. Many items on the menu specify how many pieces are included per order but when our food arrived the portions were all random. That being said I did enjoy the food and i'm already craving it."}
{"text":"First of all I don't like the whole individual pot thing. It takes away the fun of going for hotpot.

The way to judge hotpot is the soup base. I order the spicy and was very disappointed by it. Not only was it not spicy it was way too salty. The friends I went with complained of the same problem even those with non-spicy.

The cuts of meat provided were fine, but some of the vegetables, such as the carrots, were cut in odd shapes not very suitable to hotpot. Also no tofu skin left me very sad.

Little Sheep was never my first choice for hotpot when in China, but this place was not a good experience. No problems with the staff however who were fast and helpful."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Sunday night without a reservation. I only went with a friend so I thought nothing of it. We had to wait in line for 20 minutes to get a seat and the table was right outside the bathroom door! They charged extra for weekend and soup base.

I really dislike the fact that their restaurant tables are designed poorly. A table that could fit four could only seat 2 and they had large tables that could fit 8+ that were not able to be pulled apart for smaller groups of customers. There were a lot of people coming in as groups of 2-4 and they would have to wait because all their had were large tables. I also find that their 8+ tables really dysfunctional. Why would you make it a booth and you require the customers to grab their own plate of ingredients and drinks? The person(s) sitting further inside would inconvenience everyone around them if they needed to get something.

Most of the ingredients are at a self serve fridge located at the back corner of the restaurant along with drinks and some cooked foods. Beef and Lamb is to be given by the server upon request. (The first serving comes without saying) Most of the ingredients were good but I really disliked their pork balls. They were freezer burned and tasted awful after cooking it. The self serve fridge was also an inconvenience due to the fact that it was busy and everyone wanted to get ingredients at the same time. There was always a huge crowd and perhaps even lines of people trying to get stuff from the fridges. There was not enough space there to accommodate large crowds of people.

Service wasn't too bad, it was really busy so the servers were running around. Shirley was a great waitress there, very sincere and gave us quick service. She was probably the only one that I thought spoke fluent English.

I was really annoyed by their bathroom door (not just the fact that I had to sit outside of it) the door slams shut every single time someone goes in or out. They need to fix that door because it is atrocious. It's extremely loud and it has often startled me during my meal. 

The noise level was ridiculous considering how many people were there at the time (and those standing at the front waiting for a seat) There were parties of 12 who were really loud.

Overall experience, I would not return unless it's a weekday and it is not as busy. Winter is the perfect hotpot season so I understand that their business is picking up in general. The food was really mediocre and almost everything was self serve. You even had to go to the cashier yourself to pay your bill. No thanks."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time now.  As others have said, the place isn't the cleanest by any means.  I found the beef and lamb had fantastic flavour, and that spicy broth is killer.  I do have a few complaints, first of all, there was no tongs to put your RAW MEAT into the broth, this has to be accomplished by using the chopsticks or the spoon.  Now, obviously you can sanitize the sticks in the broth itself as it's hot as hell.  This should not be the way it is, and I found that to be somewhat of a turnoff.  The food stations need a bit of an overhaul, I was watching people walking by and sneezing on things, which I sought to avoid at ANY COST.  A little pricey as well, I'll give it a shot again because I thought the meat was delicious."}
{"text":"The stuff at cashier must be a joke, I accidentally skipped the tip. And the guy at cashier seems really angry with me. And asked me to pay 10-15% tip.  The food is mediocre, not worth my time. I had light diarrhea after a few hours. I can never forget that man's face. What a hater."}
{"text":"The sliced lamb is much better than other hotpot places -- much thinner and more fresh, a real northern china hot pot style.

The service is good. I got my items within 5 mins after I placed my orders.

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location over their downtown one. We went on a Sunday night and it was packed. Waited about 5 minutes for a table. They were pretty fast to set up our pot and bring us our first plates of meat.

They have a great selection of meat, seafood, veggies, dumplings, noodles. The broth can be a bit salty, but you can ask them to add more water if it's too much for you. I like the serve-yourself set-up they have for the ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with about 5 other people. I was the sole vegetarian in the bunch, so I was a little worried about how my experience would go. Veggies have no need to worry here, staff and menu is very accommodating.

They do not have non-animal meat broth. What they do for you is have a plain water base, but include a lot of spices to flavor the broth. That mixed with all the stuff you add makes a really tasty meal. Here they have the half pot option where you can share with someone even if they eat meat! I have never been to a hot pot dinning experience because, well, really hard to share stuff with the people I go out to eat with. Had a great time here.

For the veg options, there is tons of stuff to have. There is a little sauce bar where you can go up to it and choose your own condiments to add to your meal like fresh garlic - cilantro - green onions - sugar - soy sauce - chili oil -  ect.

Prices are reasonable, and the servers are very nice and always come by at a good time to get empty dishes and give water refills."}
{"text":"Well, let's just put it this way: all-you-can-eat restaurants are great when you actually enjoy the food.

I now know that I'm not a fan of Mongolian Hot Pot. Or, at least, not at this place. I was skeptical of the freshness of important food items such as shrimp and fish (not to mention the chicken livers), although I assume the florescent pink beef and lamb slices had so many preservatives in them that nothing could possibly spoil. Of course, I couldn't bring myself to eat the stuff.

In short, being adventurous with food can sometimes be a bad thing, and in this case it was a waste of money for two hungry people, who left the restaurant unfulfilled and slightly nauseated.

If you're up for the challenge, I recommend going with someone who knows what they're doing as a guide....perhaps there's a better approach to dining in this particular realm. I also recommend that you make sure that you can first handle the smell of the various seasonings in the broth before you commit to an all-you-can-eat experience.

Best of luck to you!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed, not as good as the one in LA. But overall cost performance was excellent for all you can eat @ about 15$CND. The soymilk tasted funny, though."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food experience I have had in Montreal. If you want high quality, delicious, and healthy ingredients, this is the place to go. The service was attentive, super fast, and kind. At one point, my jacket slid off the chair without me noticing, and our server picked it up for us. He was also really attentive with adding broth to our pot when it was running low. He did not rush us at all. 

I ate here for a good 3 hours, and by the time I finished, both my friend and I could only sit in stunned silence (from contentedness and fullness). We ate: platefuls of lamb, beef, wood ear, marinated beef, marinated pork, kelp, taro, watercress, A-vegetable, potato, hand pulled noodles, clear noodles, shiitake, enoki, and white mushrooms, pork blood jelly, chicken, pork skin, rice cakes, cold dishes, and tonnes of other things. The desserts were also heavenly - oh-so-light cream puffs stuffed with mango custard and cream, spring rolls, super light palmiers, plus perfectly balanced and still warm Chinese rice balls with sesame and red bean. All this was for the lunch all-you-can-eat of $14.99/person. 

The soup that all this was cooked in was also excellent: legit, no MSG, balanced broth with a whole bunch of real traditional Chinese ingredients that aid with health and digestion benefits. 

My only wish was that I had a bigger stomach. By the time I rolled out of the door, I honestly felt so satisfied on all fronts (taste, quality, health of ingredients, service, and FULLNESS) that I literally felt like I was floating on a cloud. 

By the way, the decor is excellent: super modern and clean, with modern traditional Chinese accents. Washrooms are also very clean. 

All in all, a perfect place for people who love food, and healthy food at that. Great for pairs or groups of people, especially voracious eaters. Only thing is, wear something not too nice because it will smell like wonderful hot pot after."}
{"text":"Mongolian hot pot was not as expected. Various hot pot items on the menu was not clearly intrepreted. The hot pot items, when cooked, did not taste as good as the times I have visited this location in the past. Many of the dessert items are not served anymore either. The waiters do not come often to add soup base, resulting in a burning hot pot. Overall, it was an okay experience, not the best."}
{"text":"I've been to a few hot pot spots and I have to say this one is pretty damn good. However, the spicy broth is a little excessive with the chilli's in the broth. I was literally scooping out heaps of chili's to get too the broth... I had to ask the servers to change my broth to the non-spicy one. Which they did free of charge. I was very happy that they accommodated this for me. I am a spice lover, but I could not handle it. 

So, the regular broth was really good and you could add what sauces and seasonings you wanted to give it your distinct flavor. The side dishes that came with the meal were great: especially the pork bone...yummy yummy yummy. I don't think I've ever has better tasting pork bone before. 

The meat was very fresh and so were the veggies. The servers for the most part didn't really speak English, except for one in particular that pretty much made up for the rest. They were always clearing the tables and refilling our water. 

I will definitely be returning to this hot pot spot in the future"}
{"text":"Food was great. 

We called a day in advance and told them that it was going to be 6 people. For some reason their staff remembered us calling but didn't write down our reservation so we had to wait for almost an hour. I went with vegetarian friends, and they asked for a \"clear\" pot with no flavours but the server gave us a pot with spices filled. That was kind of a disappointment. The best thing about this place, in my opinion, is its dessert buns with sweetened condensed milk. That was really good. The lamb and everything was fresh, and everything is worth 5 stars. 

1 star is taken away because of the inconvenience of waiting for a table even with a reservation."}
{"text":"Super! Une tonne de choix d'accompagnements et les bouillons sont vraiment délicieux. Service plutôt rapide."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch buffet on a Sunday (12:30pm).

There wasn't a line up which is nice for a Sunday, I expected it to be a bit busier, but no complaints.  For those who don't know, hot pot is where you get a pot over a burner and you cook your food yourself.

Atmosphere/decor, the restaurant is nicely decorated.  Note that because it is hot pot, it will be a bit noisy and depending on where you sit, you may have steam in your face.  Depending on the table you get, you either share a pot or you get individual pots for yourself (which is nice).

Service, typical Chinese service.  You will need to flag down a server if you need anything, don't expect them to be attentive, but since I know what to expect, it is normal.  You do need to get your own food other than the lamb/beef (you need to ask the server for more), so they aren't really required (aside from the initial order and to fill your pot with more soup base).

Food, typical hot pot food and selection.  You go up with a plate and fill it with what you like to cook and repeat until you are full.  There are a lot of choices although I feel their desserts are lacking for lunch (only two).  You do get unlimited drinks (fill yourself).

Cost, it is a bit more expensive on the weekends, but seems inline with other hot pot places.  I believe it was around $23 after tax/tip for unlimited beef/lamb (there is an option where you only get one plate of each, I believe for $4 less), but the rest is all you can eat (there are lots of veggies, fish/beef/shrimp/lamb balls, dumplings, noodles, chicken/pork, among other things).

I have no issues with the restaurant.  Do note that the servers are all Chinese, so English may be minimal but we had no issues in general."}
{"text":"Been to many hot pot and this is the worst.  First they charge you for your base soup to which other hot pot restaurant offer for free.  Second, there is a charge of a dollar extra for weekend and holidays for each item you order which is a little weird. Third,  there is also not much variety of food.  Celebrity hotpot across the street is better."}
{"text":"First time trying hot pot and the experience was overall good. I had fun picking out what I wanted to add. Next time I will have more of a plan as to what I add, as I went a little crazy and put some of everything in at once; which ruined some of the flavours. But I left feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night so it wasn't very busy so maybe my take on the service might be generous.
Unlike a lot of the reviews here I had almost zero issues with the service, in fact they were very very prompt on removing empty dishes after the contents were added to the soup pot.
Couple of times I even wanted to ditch a few garbage items (mussel shells /  corn cobs) on one of the plates but it was whisked away super quick.
They seemed to be super quick asking my friend if he wanted another beer that's a plus, but I was saddened by the fact asking for a side of \"Clam\" for mine got me a ......I have no clue what you're talking about look(come on this is Calgary the home of the Caesar ).
On the downside, they missed a couple of things that were ordered for our second round.
The meats and veg seemed fresh enough, but the menu was much smaller than what was listed on the web site.
Was a lot of fun , and I will do it again but the price tag for a meal for 2  was a little excessive, mainly the $12 pot of broth and the lack of expensive ingredients(very little seafood).

Went again for a lunch special and was pleasantly impressed seemed to be just enough food."}
{"text":"Mongolian hot pot is generally pretty fun for groups, and this place definitely does it right.  They've got perfect  looking super fresh beef and lamb, and their buffet of vegetables, noodles, and seafood to throw in the broth are terrific.  You can be as tame or as adventurous as you want when you come here b/c of the variety of buffet selections.

Service was good, and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Although this place was on the list for Montreal's 10 worst health code violators... there is just something about the soup that keeps me coming back. I know the restaurant is probably filthy, but I just can't stay away. My hope is that the hot soup kills all the bacteria and we will leave satisfied and full with no problems except the nasty smell it leaves behind in your clothes, skin and hair."}
{"text":"Horrible service,very slow and not fresh food,go to Brossard one,way much better! We went there for the lunch,the wait stuff constantly miss our orders and impolite, never return"}
{"text":"It is an interesting experience for someone that is not used to this kind of food. I liked the choice of broth (spicy or mild), the taste of the broth, the \"all you can eat\" seafood and fresh veggies. They have a great selection of fresh veggies and seafood you can put in the broth. It is really healthy and tasty. I like the fact that putting food in the broth slow down the \"eating pace\" of everyone around the table, so that the meal last longer, giving us more time to talk and enjoy each other company. I am planning on going back when i'm in Montreal! The place is huge, so it is good for groups, family, etc..."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Reasonably large restaurant with seating from 2 on up.  Lots of booth seats and what looks like room for large parties in the back.  Bright fluorescent lighting permeates throughout.  Due to the size of this place, it's not too noisy when its crowded.

Food:  Respectable hot-pot fare.  Decent choice of broths and a wide selection of ingredients allow for numerous cooking combinations.  They even have a nice selection of sauces and desserts.  It's not anything fancy, and in fact reminds me something of a potluck, but it's a nice touch.

Service:  Prompt and friendly.  The staff even keeps on eye out for low broth levels in individual pots and will re-fill without needing to be asked.  The ingredients seem to be well stocked and checked often.  English speakers should not have a problem here as the staff seemed to speak it pretty well and even offered tips on hot-pot cooking should someone be new to the experience.

Price:  For the buffet style food selection and sheer quantity of food, this is a pretty good deal.  $17-22 per person.

Hassle factor:  Due to ample seating, I can't imagine there ever being a wait to get a table unless you had a very large party.  This establishment is also in the heart of chinatown so parking might be an issue at some times of the day if you are driving.  A set of rather steep stairs lead into the restaurant which may be a problem for anyone who can not navigate steps.

Overall:  3.5 stars.  Good for just about any casual diners.  Groups ok.  Kids ok."}
{"text":"Bad customer service and also food wasnt fresh.
 Also try tonorder some stuff in the menu but they didnt have...."}
{"text":"I like the self serve idea. There are some other hot pot places where you have to order everytime you want something. They have a good variety of vegetables, sauces, and deserts. The only downside is that it's always packed and you may have to wait a long time for a table."}
{"text":"Like to eat here. Spicy and delicious. Will recommend to my friend
Comme à manger ici. Épicée et délicieuse. Je le recommanderai à mon ami"}
{"text":"It's a great place and very customer-friendly. I loved the broth separation in the same pot (caters to different tastes: check). You are immersed in vapors and you come out feeling very full. 

I enjoyed almost everything I put on my plate, but when the place is crowded the food can get mixed up on the shelves. 

I really like it."}
{"text":"So good.. I always get the mixed half and half broth. Of course I ha e to take some if the spices out and add them once they've refilled it"}
{"text":"It's really far away from downtown,  but the food is ok."}
{"text":"Great \"potato\" noodles!  They're unique to this hot pot chain.

This is certainly not Mongolian though.  It's Chinese."}
{"text":"I thought it was alright. The staff were quick to serve you, although the place tend to get crowded really fast. Food was okay. I'd go back again when i get a chance."}
{"text":"Excellent,  J'y vais souvent et je recommande!  Beaucoup de choix!  L'endroit et très occupé et je conseille d'arrivé tôt pour le souper!  Le prix est de 22$ par personne je crois, mais ça vaut la peine.. On en ressort bien rempli!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite destination for AYCE hot pot and I use it as a measure against other hot pot places I visit. 

The Hot Pot: 5/5 - The place is large and you have the choice between a personal pot or a shared pot, between mild or spicy broth or a split pot of both. Their spicy broth is too spicy for my taste so I always get the mild broth which is so delicious. The one thing I like about this hot pot place is that it is buffet style. You order the meats from the server (pork, beef, lamb), but for all the other small dishes like beef balls, vegetables etc, you go pick out your portions are the food bar. I'd say it's a decent selection of side dishes but could offer more. I like the idea of choosing my own portions instead of ordering \"1 serving\" and low and behold they give me an entire basket of napa cabbage when I only wanted a handful... They have a great assortment of sauces to conjure up your own sauce to dip your hot pot ingredients in and they have a variety of pop as well as chrysanthemum tea, soy milk, and plum juice if you fancy them alongside your meal. There are raw eggs for those who like putting them in their sauce or hot pot and they even have some nice desserts to end off your meal (though not the best tasting desserts.. it's not exactly what you come for). Why I like this place so much is that it is one of the few places where I don't have to order off a piece of paper (except for the meats) but I am given the freedom to choose what I want to eat, and when I want to it eat it. 

Cost: 4/5 - Running close to ~$20+tip for dinner, I'd say it's fair price to pay for the greater freedom of choice and decent assortment of dish dishes and drinks.

Service: 4/5 - they are attentive and come promptly with your first serving of meat. They will fill your pot often enough (sometimes you may have to ask), but I've never once complained about their service and have had plenty of good hot pot meals here to date. 

Ambience: 4/5 - SMELLY. If you can, leave your nice jackets in the car and try to wear old clothes or come here close to laundry day. You get used to smell very fast but coming out from a full meal here... and everyone will know you've had hot pot. It's not noisy, average and it's clean."}
{"text":"Went with my family and we shared a large pot. They started us off with 4 plates of meat as everything is self serve and the meat gets grabbed very quickly if it's busy. They have a sauce station for mixing your own. We found some mouldy broccoli though which was worrying...service was a little slow so you gotta wait a bit."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm over-hyping it with 5 stars since this was my first ever hot pot experience, but I really enjoyed it. We told the waitress that we hadn't been there before, and she brought us a picture menu on top of the fill-in menu. The pictures really helped in determining what we wanted to try out. We weren't shy; we ordered veggies, all the meats, dumplings, seafood, noodles, mushrooms, etc. Our favourites were fresh shrimp and spinach noodles. There were 3 of us and we ordered the ying-yang hot pot.. now, I normally love spicy, but in this case, I preferred the white broth. The spicy broth was essentially white broth, but with a lot of chopped hot peppers inside (including the tongue-numbing seeds). 
I found the service to be friendly and quick. One lady came by often to offer the tables fast-service lamb and beef. Everything else has to be ordered from the menu. We ended up just making one very large order at the beginning, and we were satisfied with it. We visited on a Friday night, and I'm glad we made a reservation as there was a line-up when we arrived. I should also mention that we really took our time dining, and we never felt that they were rushing us out. I'm definitely coming back here :)"}
{"text":"Favourite hot pot restaurant in Montreal! Compared to Chinatown one, it's super easy to find a parking spot here! As soon as we sat down, three plates of lamb were brought to our table. And it's not as busy as the Chinatown one. So it's a good idea if you have a dinner with your family. And take your time to enjoy"}
{"text":"Eh. That's all I can say for the experience I had.

I went there for my dad's birthday and the waiter guided us to a table in the other room of the restaurant that had this kind of cold atmosphere (whereas the other part of the restaurant was lively and well lit). 

The waiters were quick and efficient, didn't make much conversation, like at other restaurants in Chinatown. 

The food was good, nothing special. (Maybe it's because I don't really like hot pot, I like to eat my food immediately)

Eh again."}
{"text":"The good thing is the waitress are very efficient. Don't expect so much from the \"service\" field. I'm so glad some waitress from earlier does not work their anymore. Some were really really rude and gives customers attitude but I went there recently, it was a bit better because the rude ones were not there. 

The soup based I ordered was chicken/ or the clear soup. It was really salty! There's nothing special about it or something not special about it. You need to get up and get some of the food like veggies/tofu. There are other better ones in town!"}
{"text":"Food - overall food is fresh. Points taken away from the sauce section. Sauces are in containers put in a trolley cart, doesn't seem too appealing. Customers have to match the sauces in the container to a grid taped to the wall, in order to find out what the sauces were.

Environment - Spacious and clean. Points taken away because waiters/waitresses don't take away the dishes. So, as we ordered more food, we need to stack up the empty plates ourselves.

Service - Bad. The waiter we had was a tall and slim built gentleman, named Chris. He spoke rudely and had a bad attitude overall - he was not willing to add soup to our pot and demanded us to lower the heat of the pot when it was not even boiling. He kept coming to lower the heat without our consent, again, when the water was barely boiling. There was once he even came to turn off the pot. Hello? This is hot pot, the food need to be boiled in a HOT pot to cook. Secondly, some food we order did not come. Chris made the whole dinner experience become stress and pressure. On a side note, a lady (oddly she had no name tag) who served us dessert was nicer, friendly and more patience.


Overall - The same Mongolian Hot Pot was better at other locations in terms of service and food. The other locations in ON and BC was way better in service and overall."}
{"text":"great food and price,customer service  isnt bad as in other review:we went there on a busy sunday lunch time and the waitress was nice with us . tip for chinese buffet beginners?if you cant see the food you ordered for 30min+ just reorder it, there is only 5% chance that they didnt forgot your order"}
{"text":"For what you get,  the price is outrageous.  Soup is one of the cheapest meals to put together.  Even with their ayce option it is far too expensive.  One meal for 2 people with 1 beer was $65!! Compare that to Korean BBQ which you get lots of quality meats at $40 and you can see why I won't be back k here.  The broths weren't that great either.  Stick to pho if you want soup!"}
{"text":"My bill came down to $32 after tips and tax. They charged additional money for the soup base ($2.99). Food was not impressive at all, common frozen food sections only. Will not go again."}
{"text":"really good food, service isn't amazing, but the food is flavourful and it's a fun experience. there's a decent amount of food to choose from, kabobs are extra. but you have unlimited of everything else. a bit pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Firstly, little sheep is my favourite hot pot brand.  The restaurant is clean and has nice atmosphere. Yada Yada.

The price at this location is embarrassing however. For 2 people, and 15% gratuity, the bill will be over $67 with no drinks etc.. (charge $10.99 for your broth over and above the $23.99 ea)

If you have a family,  or bring friends,  your bill will be well over $100. Probably closer to $200 if they want a drink. 

Sure the food is good,  but not that good.

Just buy an electric hotpot and little lamb broth (sold at T&T in the mall next door),  and you'll save yourself the massive dent in the pocketbook.

Goodbye little sheep.  I look forward to buying your supplies from the liquidation auction after your bankruptcy."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite part about our trip to Montreal was the food! After touring the Basilique Notre-Dame, my boyfriend and I wandered through China Town and stumbled upon a bright neon sign with a cute little lamb. We weren't quite sure what we were getting into but decided this would be the place to eat. 

Neither one of us had heard of hot pot and we were quite intrigued by the convection stove tops at each table. (This was before we discovered Korean bbq) The waiter brought out a menu with pictures...first you choose your broth- regular or spicy. I like trying anything new so we got both. Then you have your choice of different raw meats to put in your pot. They bring out this huge pot with a divider so it contains both types of broth and let the broth simmer while you stock up at the buffet. They have every kind of vegetable, noodle and seafood you can think of; local as well as unidentifiable. As overzealous newbies, we each filled our plates with just about everything and piled it into the soup. The meat is brought out raw and cooks in the broth, much like Pho'.  The regular broth is not regular at all, it was very well seasoned with whole spices right in the pot. The spicy was screaming hot, but that is how to should be. It was all amazing and very, very filling.

The quality of the food was great, the dining experience was really fun and I would recommend this place to anyone going to Montreal.  I heard there is a Little Sheep here in San Diego, so soon I will stop by there as well :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, reasonable pricing.  Came here on a weekday and it was $24, plus another additional $1 for basic soup base or $2 for the spicy option.  

The food choice selection had lots of options with waiters refilling the food and drinks throughout the evening.  I saw other patrons accidentally dropping the raw food at the buffet on the floor, and the waiters would pick it up and throw it out.  They could use more tongs at the buffet since many of the same tongs were being used for handling both the raw meats and veggies.  

Service was top notch, with our server coming by to refill our soup constantly and also providing plates of beef when they saw we were running low.  

Overall, pleasant experience.  This experience was shared by my party of which some had never had hotpot before."}

When it's cold and raining outside, what do you crave? I often think of good bowl of pho or hot pot. Last time I had hotpot was back in Vancouver before I moved to Toronto and that is already 4 months ago! This is just unacceptable.

Thank goodness for my friend who drives and is kind enough to bring me to a AYCE hotpot place for lunch on a cold, freezing day. Most Hot Pot places don't open for lunch and it was difficult finding one that was open for business, but we did it! Mongolian Hot Pot (also known as Little Cattle) is one of few open for business at lunch time.

Inside of the restaurant is bright, spacious with lots of seating area.
It wasn't too busy when we dropped by since it was on a weekday and just around 12o'clock.

For lunch, you can get $10.99 for a individual pot where they give you one plate of lamb and beef as well as some vegetables on the side. Since my friend and I was starving, we decided to go for AYCE which was $13.99 (only $3 difference too, might as well go for AYCE!) You can pick the soup base depending on what you like. I wanted the regular soup and spicy so I went with the 'Little Sheep soup base for affectionate couples' which was $2.50 (LOL at asian menus)

Unlike some places, you get your own individual pot which was convenient.
The spicy soup looks really scary but trust me, it's not that spicy. Once the soup comes, you can order plates of beef or lamb and the pick up the rest of vegetables, noodles, sauces and drinks at the buffet station in the corner. There is pepsi, diet pepsi, 7up, Mountain Dew, Plum tea and more- so take your pick. You take the large plate that is provided for you on the table and walk over to the station to grab whatever you wish.

I added Sesame Oil, Chili paste, Raw egg and LOTS of cilantro to my sauce. You can mix and match whatever you like to suit your taste. I liked how you can pick how much of each item you want to try on the individual plate. Because when you order from menu (even if it's AYCE), sometimes you just want few pieces of vegetables instead of a whole plate.

I really enjoyed both of the soup base (regular and spicy) and appreciated how I could control the heat from my side. The servers constantly walk around refilling the soup base for you if you run out.

Keep in mind that your clothes will smell SO MUCH after this though, I would stay away from anything fancy (why would you when you go for hot pot anyways?) or dry clean.

Summary: It's hard to find a Hot Pot place that's open for lunch- for $13.99 per person, it's worth every penny and the quality of food is above average for a AYCE place. I've been back 3 more times since my first visit and it's become my go-to place for a Hot Pot!!

{"text":"Boiled meat
It all starts  good but after a while all your have is a big pot of boiling fat . It even looks a bit nasty  .
If you order the hot you get so many chilli skins that you have to pick the hard shells out of you soup. 
They charge you for drink not like  other hot pot places  that don't. 
For about  $22.00 a person for boiled meat  no thanks very over priced.
If you a big Eater good luck  to you they will avoid you table after a while.
They do have great decor I gave them one star for that."}
{"text":"As far as hotpot goes, I think that this is the only decent one in Montreal so far.  Located up on the second floor with ample views of the mean streets of Chinatown, a window seat is almost mandatory for the full experience. 

The three most important things for a delicious hotpot are:
-robust broth (so I recommend only ordering their spicy herbal broth)
-fresh vegetables and thin sliced meats
-a well-made dipping sauce

The well-made sauce portion of a good hotpot meal relies solely on you, the patron, to make at the sauce bar.  No one is going to hold your hand through this process, but I can attempt to give you a quick recipe for a good one;  2:12 hot chili oil with bits, 2:12 soy sauce, 1:12 sesame oil, 2:12 scallion/chives, 2:12 cilantro (a must have), 1:12 vinegar, 1:12 paste/minced garlic, 1:12 ginger paste.  There is also a sesame paste sauce that can be made using diluted sesame paste, but I like spicy.

Don't be afraid of the watercress, and try making a hard boiled egg.  The cooked egg is delicious peeled and then dipped into your dipping sauce.

There is also a small buffet portion set up that has things like spring rolls and sesame balls.  But, I found these items not to be very fresh.  There is also an all-you-can-drink soda and juice fountain that actually has some delicious sweetened soy milk on tap and orange juice."}
{"text":"Things always goes well when a place is not busy. I understand, they are busy right now and things definitely goes way below my expectations this Saturday, September 26. I am right now seating in the restaurant have already wait for my order for 30 minutes. No one brought us anything so far. Don't waste your money and switch to another place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice: once for dinner and once for lunch, and both times were pretty good! The lunch is $15.99 and dinner $21.99, but on weekends and holidays, it's an additional $1. You get three rounds to order from the order sheet, but they had us order the beef and lamb slices verbally, so I guess it doesn't count towards the three rounds? There are two types of tables: one is just a large shared pot, and the other you get your personal pot. 

I'd say the lunch is a much better deal if you're here to eat mostly meat. The beef and lamb are excellent!! I'd also really recommend the thick rice noodles and taro, they are so good!
They have a few side dishes but they aren't great. Both times they have been spring rolls (a lot of the crusty outside but not much filling), some seaweed salad, and some noodles. Water, plum juice, and soy milk are self-serve. 
The service was okay but they were really busy and there weren't many servers, so it always took some time to flag someone down."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat ever! Whenever I am in Calgary,I want to eat here. 
Everything about this place I love! They always have a wonderful smell of fresh food and spice when you walk in. The restaurant is a nice clean place.
I had discovered this place last summer when I was in Calgary. I have been here to eat maybe about 11 or 12 times now.
The staff is amazing and will explain all the foods ingredients to you if you like. 
You cook the food yourself at the table in a hot pot. 
The soup broth quickly comes to a boil,then you add the ingredients. 
Starting with the ones that take the longest to cook. 
I always get my favorite, the Seafood Hot Pot.Although I have tried the Lamb as well. It is all good,very good!
 Seafood has Fish, Shrimp, Shrimp Balls, Tofu, Bok Choy, Yams, and Green vegetables. As well as wonderful rice noodles. 
It is Magnificent !  Also the Hot Pot comes with Plum Juice and a Pot of Hot Tea.
The place is totally clean and welcoming.
Ladies Room is very nice and clean as well."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is great and the food is even better. You can chose between regular or spicy broth or get both as a ying yang pot. This restaurant is where we had our first hot pot and have since had other places but this will always be our favorite. It's all about the broth and this place has only the best. Veggies are always fresh and so is everything else. Prices arent bad either for what you can get, I mean it's all you can eat. We always leave here full, satisfied and very happy."}
{"text":"You never go wrong with the Original Mongolian hot pot when you go to Little Sheep. The funniest thing is that I actually discovered the Mongolian hot pot in Mongolia back in 2010 and it was a Little Sheep restaurant! 

I was so happy to find out we had them here too!  I can say that the food is pretty much the same as in Mongolia which renders the place very authentic.

Take the half and half broth (original and spicy) so you can alternate or separate the items you're cooking.

The service is very prompt when you ask for more, since it's an all you can eat. Some staff speak a decent English; otherwise they will rapidly send an English speaking colleague to your table.

Only warning I would give is that boiling spicy broth is smelly, so expect to have to wash your hair and clothes after visiting :) 
But it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I love Little Sheep.

This establishment is a world wide and definitely put a name for themselves. 

They run their hot pot as a self server style environment. Each person gets a pot and a choice of soup. You have to go over to the common area and make your own dipping sauce and also go to the wall of food where you can pick as much raw food as you like at your own discretion. No need to order from a piece of paper and wait for it to come. You can control your own portions and keep eating at your own pace. 

The best part of this is it is also all you can drink. They have a fountain machine for a wide selection of pops. As well they have fountains for soy milk, plum juice, chrysanthemum tea or ice tea.

The only con is their choices of dessert. They only have 3 small choices and they are just bite size pastries. Nothing special. Most hot pot locations have ice cream, mango pudding etc.

They are so famous that they have their own soup base prepackaged and sold in chinese supermarkets. They definitely have a way to market themselves.

Expect a long line up on weekends. It is advised to come in groups of 2 or consider sharing tables.

Must go and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Filthy, to start. The floor was beyond disgusting. Broth was like recycled dishwater, and the fish was not fresh. The rest was tasteless. Sauces were bad...I can't believe that even the hoisin was gross...I did not know that was possible. Dessert was canned fruit which was the highlight. Second worse meal of my life, worst in Montreal. My boyfriend and I left nauseous and it cost $45 for the two of us. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"The last time I step in a little sheep franchise was like 5 years ago, not a hot pot fan. Tried the downtown location, think I will be going back soon lol

Pro:
-great homemade meatballs, fish, beef, lamb, shrimps 
-marble beef
-good variety of food for vegetarians as well
-spacious 
-amazing garlic oil

Con:
-2 soup bases only, spicy and non spicy chicken broth with spices (vegetarians can ask to remove the chicken broth)

This location is spacious! Got a 6 people table and mini pots for everyone in my group. Love the individual pots, the stove control is easy to use. Plum soups and soy milk all you can drink, the sauce bar is at the front of the store.  Servers are friendly and attentive. Would be a good idea to call a head of time to book a big table for big groups."}
{"text":"Little Sheep is probably my favourite hotpot in YYC. I most often go for all you can eat so I'll base my review on that. It's somewhere in the $22 range, but I always add the bottomless iced tea because it is the perfect match for all the sodium! I'm not a fan of packaged iced tea but theirs is so delicious - think vita lemon tea.

If you go on a weekday, you usually get the soup included so you don't have to pay extra for that, if not you have to pay extra for soup, so -1/2star for that. That being said the soups are so flavourful, not bland in the least!

AYCE menu is pretty well stocked, my must haves are quail egg, all of the meat balls, fatty beef, kelp knot, yam noodles or udon, enoki mushrooms, house made kimchi and the dumplings. A little advice, if you don't already know and love the notorious bung and are looking to be adventurous, don't. 

One of my favourite parts of hotpot here is the condiment station where you can make a concoction of your favourite sauces and garnishes for dipping.

Service is pretty terrible unless it's super slow. They're perpetually understaffed, -1 star for this. Once I got so fed up with waiting for an iced tea refill that I went to fill myself up at the drink station and ended up getting the identical looking pitcher of salty plum drink instead. You can go ahead and add that to the bung blacklist."}
{"text":"If there is negative rating, I will choose for this place. We came to this place with group of 5. After we finished disappointed dinner, we asked the waiter for the bill, they add 15% tips on top of it WITHOUT notify us, then we tiped them again, before we left the restaurant, one of our friend figured out the number was not right, so we asked the waiter for the receipt, he told us \"Sorry, we don't have your receipt anymore after you guys paid\", then we asked if the bill add tips already? The waiter did not willing to response and just told us\" I don't know\" then walked away. What a shame.

All in all, very bad experience, their cheap price come with the consequences. Cheap quality of the broth and food, especially their \"famous\" lamb slices, bad services, unethical business conduct.

Will NOT come back agian."}
{"text":"YES!!!!! FINALLY H O T - P O T in Mississauga. 

I don't have to drive all the way east to get some good hot pot.
Best of all, its the Mongolian little sheep franchise. 

So I've been to the Mongolian in San Fran, and this was easily comparable. The only difference is that this Mississauga location offers AYCE. That's right! The quality and selection of items were great. They were not shy about giving us endless amounts of beef, and HAND MADE noodles (a must try) along with many other options. 

The only complaints I have, which are standard for hot pot places (even at home):
-Not enough table space for big groups, big orders
-Only ONE round of ice cream (order them up!) 
-If you order separate pots, they charge you an additional unavoidable, $2.50 per bowl. So if you're with a family, share a bowl! It will save you about $10.00.

The location is great, it is situated in the \"Chinese\" area/mall of Mississauga and is replacing the old Congee Dynasty. 
Seating and ambience are great, there is a whole bunch of space in there. But make sure you go early! It fills up FAST on the weekend. 
Service is A-OK, can't expect too much at a Chinese restaurant. But overall they got what we needed when we wanted. 

I was only there a couple of days ago, and my mouth is watering to go back! 
Thoroughly impressed! :)"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this hot pot experience. Customer service was excellent. We got the spicy broth and it was extremely overwhelming. Every time I tried to scoop beef or any food item I would end up with a hand full of chillies. It was annoying as I had to pick the chilli out and put it aside. The beef tasted stale. I really enjoyed corn. That's really it. Oh and the red bean Icecream. Overall, I think the broth ruined everything. I would not go here again. I still love celebrity hot pot!!!!! ALSO YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR DRINKS!!!! Many Hot pot places those drinks are included!"}

  Je vous explique le concept : Les tables sont toutes munies d'une plaque de cuisiniere avec une temperature ajustable ( touch screen please, voir photo ) et vous choisissez un bouillon dans lequel vous pourrez tremper differents aliments a deguster. Le choix est vaste et delicieux : des lanieres de viandes de boeuf et d'agneau + du poisson, des calamars + un assortiment de legumes et bien d'autres accompagnements comme du tofu ( Prenez en sans hesitation) ou encore des nouilles par exemples ! Tout y est bon sans exception.

Quant au lieu, le resto se trouve en plein coeur du quartier chinois. En y entrant, on y decouvre une grande salle lumineuse en haut d'un escalier - un espace ideal pour aller manger en groupe d'amis ou en tete a tete!  Le prix est a considerer - peut atteindre presque 30$ ( tips inclus) par personne dependant des journees je crois bien mais pour l'experience, je crois que cela en vaut la peine! Le service est rapide et efficace mais sans plus. 

Pour le reste, je vous laisse decouvrir - ce n'est pas un coup de coeur mais c'est different - et cela peut toujours ameliorer notre routine quotidienne :). Je le recommande! 

Perso, j'y ferais certainement un tour une autre fois avant la fin de l'hiver!"}
{"text":"Comparing to the one located at Brossard, this one has fall slightly short. The service is inefficient even with multiple waiters, and they always forgot my orders when I asked for more lamb slices.

The condiments in the sauce section constantly lack ingredients, and the place seems to be messy and dirty almost all the time. In addition, the fried appetizers are always cold and soggy, and they rarely bother to renew it.

The waiting time in a Friday or Saturday evening is utterly ridiculous. They do not accept reservations from 4-9pm (last time I checked). In addition, the lamb meat they serve sometimes are stale, and you can tell from the colour that it was not very fresh.

At any rate, this place still remains one of my favourite restaurants in downtown, however I'd like to see some improvements being made."}
{"text":"Much better than the one in Chinatown. They have the fermented chives in the sauce section which adds an amazing flavour to your dipping sauce. The interior decor is pretty good and the spacing is great.

The service, however, is not very efficient given they only have 2-3 waiters, even during dinner time."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday for dinner.
Soup base is very nice and you can also get a spicy soup base.
Plenty of meat variety(beef slices, garlic beef, garlic chicken,lamb slices,seafood and many more)
So the food was very tasty and you can make your own side sauce. Server was very nice but the only thing I don't like is the servers can't speak English we were communicating with pictures which we showed them on our phones.... that was the only thing we don't like everything else was very nice.
I would recommend this place for lunch and dinner get together with family and friends."}
{"text":"Their beverage is absolutely disgusting!! The waiter came out with a greasy home depot construction bucket to refill the drinks. Yuk! Also having a bad stomach ache from the food! For 30+ dollars i suggest you go somewhere else. Unless dirty food isn't a concern for you."}
{"text":"It's a cute hot pot place I will say, and it's nice that they let you choose between having one big pot to share and an individual pot. Compared to other hot pot places, the side options are slightly lacking. Service is pretty decent. I never once had to ask for my broth to be refilled throughout the whole night, which was definitely a plus."}
{"text":"Our family driver decided to take us here for some hot pot - my boyfriend went too and it was because of him that we went here. He is a big lamb eater and they serve AYCE lamb here (and you can also order plates of beef slices). Lamb and Beef are AYCE - I think we went through 10 plates.

The interior is modern and what I like is that each person gets their own stove and hotpot. Our table got some herbal soup base, and I just flavoured it with beef slices, seafood, and vegetables. You get to pick out your ingredients from a wall in the corner: variety of noodles, shrimp and mussels to beef balls. I have to say I found the set up kind of dirty. Tongs to pick up the ingredients were sometimes on the food itself (after being touched by many, hopefully, washed hands). Also, tongs that picked up raw seafood would find itself to the vegetable plate (I saw one customer do this...I wouldn't be surprised if other customers did this as well). Also, people speak and cough right near these open ingredients so...(Some buffets now have a slanted glass cover at face-level to prevent these kinds of things from happening). 

There is a table full of different sauces, a pop station, and some random bowls of fried bread.

When it gets busy, this ingredient station is hard to manoeuvre because it's so small.

Hot Pot is definitely a winter-month experience. All the steam from the boiling hot pots adds an extra layer of heat. Great experience for customers who don't know what hot pot is. Other than that, not really my kind of thing."}
{"text":"It's my second time here and still quite impressed! 

This time around I came for lunch and paid for the lunch menu. They give a choice of whether you want to pay for the lunch or dinner menu.   

Lunch menu includes: all veggies and meat (lamb, beef, garlic beef & chicken).

Dinner menu includes: all veggies, all meat options above and all seafood. Your options double when choosing the dinner menu. 

The soft broth has quite a kick to it but very delicious! And FYI it's got TONS of chilies! 

They give you 3 rounds of ordering...it may not sound a lot but it is! Once you get the feel of how much food you get during the first round you'll know what to order for the next! 

Ummmm white rice on the side is FREE! But it was cold and kinda overcooked but whatevssss! 

And they have a \"sauce station\" where you can make combinations or grab just one to add more flavour to your food! 

DELISH! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places because there is unlimited meat and I like spicy food. I'm not too keen on the service because I didn't really feel the staff cared that's why I didn't give this place 5 stars. However the food is good and I like the home made noodles. The home made noodles are chewy and I can taste the difference between the store brought noodles and the home made noodles. I like their all you can eat goat meat, that's tasty and I like the spicy sauces."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here, but the experience completely disappointed me. 

Although the selection was good I found the food quality and taste poor, service was questionable and the \"ambiance\" was cafeteria-esque.

{"text":"Good value for hot pot, recent hot pot venues are way over price. Enjoy the self serve so you never left wondering if what you ordered is coming. Free drinking which is a plus."}
{"text":"I took my family our for our first Mongolian Hot Pot experience last night. I purchased the Groupon that was $19 for $40 for 4 people (basically one person free). Two of us got the split pots with both regular and spicy broth and the other two just got the regular broth. I really liked that they had the split pot option so you get the best of both worlds. Our server brought our pots and turned on our burners and we were good to go. 

First we brought our cups up to the self serve beverage machine to fill our cups. Then we brought our plates up to the raw food buffet to fill up and bring back to the table to begin hot potting. After that we went back up to fill our bowls with the sauces of our choosing.

I was not too adventurous, but my Mom and sister were and tried a lot of the more interesting options such as the fungus and both really enjoyed it. I liked the wontons and dumplings and vegetables. The noodles were great as they really soak up the broth and it's flavour, but proved to be difficult to get out of the pot once cooked. Don't bother saving room for dessert because it's nothing special.

Service was great, they were always coming around to fill our pots whenever they got low and always asked if we wanted more beef or lamb when our plates were empty. It was quite busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table around 6:30. However, there were people waiting when we were leaving. 

We all decided it was good, but we were not overly impressed or have any plans to go back any time soon. It was a lot of work, but a great experience none the less that I think everyone should try especially with a Groupon so you don't pay full price."}
{"text":"This is our first experience for Hot Pot.  Along with the fact this is 1 of the few Hot Pot resto listed under Yelp for the Scarborough area.

Service : servers could do better with their English comprehension.  There isn't much to say on service due to this is a primarily a self-serve Hot Pot AYCE.  The servers don't hover, but do check on your broth level if you need more.

There are only 2 broths available, regular and spicy.  We opted to get the 1/2 regular 1/2 spicy.  We preferred the regular broth over the spicy.  The broth was just ok, since they have a large sauce bar to choose from.  Tho I'm not an expert at combining for a good sauce for dipping..what I did combine I didn't like so much (fermented bean paste + garlic + chive sauce + sesame paste (w/ground peanuts) + sesame oil + coriander).  Something in that mixture made the end result salty.  My wife's mixture was more palatable at least when I dipped into it (garlic + sesame paste (w/ground peanuts) + sesame oil).

We got interested in Hot Pot due to Mikey Chen of Strictly Dumpling on Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOKEdfOFxsHO_-Su3K8SHg

Price per Adult on a Saturday is $22.00 CAD + HST.  Seemed kinda expensive, but as compared to the US Hot Pot places that Mikey Chen had reviewed, $22.00 is a good price (not factoring in CAD - USD exchange)

There is a large selection of items to choose from to cook in your broth.  When you sit down you receive (2 plates of thinly sliced beef and 1 plate of thinly sliced lamb), we didn't opt for the beef or the lamb, since we're not big on red meat.  There is also chicken & pork in the self-serve area.  There is a good selection of \"balls\" (lobster/fish/cuttlefish/shrimp/etc).  Decent variety of tofu along with various green veggie options & mushrooms/fungus, variety of different noodles.  All in all we made a total of 6 trips for food to dump into our hot pot.

There was also some cooked items available : spring rolls, a noodle dish, seaweed, steamed plain buns.

Beverages : they have soft drinks on fountain along with in separate fountain dispensers (sweetened soy milk, lemon water, plum juice).

The dessert options are fairly limited.  Canned peaches, there was another dessert dish that I didn't recognize and it wasn't labelled either which was beside the sliced canned peaches.  2 pastry options and fried shrimp crackers.  There was fresh quartered orange slices as well.

It would have been nice to know the prices ahead of time.  There was no posting near the entrance about prices along with no signs of means of what forms of payment they accept.  I had to ask one of the staff what forms of payment they take and her English wasn't good..since it appeared that she was struggling with what I had asked.

We'll likely make a repeat visit when we happen to be craving Hot Pot."}
{"text":"$22 all you can eat hot pot with amazing broth and amazing lamb? Hell yes!

Their clear broth is among the best I've had in US and Canada. It's so good that one can enjoy it without any dipping sauce. And the lamb - sliced super thin and ultra tender. It takes less than 10 seconds to cook and just melts in your mouth. 

For $22, I would say they have a pretty nice variety of selections - anywhere from tofu, veggies, to mushroom, beef, fish balls, shrimp, rice cake, and noodles. But my two favorite items other than the lamb were the handmade noodles (remember, get that instead of the udon! Way better), and the quail eggs. I would be living in paradise if I could only having the lamb, the noodles, the quail eggs, and some veggies cooked in the rich broth everyday! 

A lot of people on Yelp complained about the service. However, I didn't have any issue with service (maybe they have now improved?). The two male waiters who helped us were both friendly and attentive and our orders always came within a couple minutes. Now I just wish I lived it Montréal so that I can come back more!!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 (60% of final grade)
Evidently, the beef and pork were never frozen before-- very succulent and tender meat. The offerings in general were, however, the norm. WATERCRESS out in the open IN FULL SUPPLY OH YES.

Ambiance 3/5 (10% of final grade)
I liked the little individual hotpots-- it's so cute! The atmosphere in general is loud and perfect for friends to gather and chat over yummy food!

Service 3/5 (10% of final grade)
I would have said nothing notable of the service, but then I remembered that one of the servers was very dedicated and fast with bringing more meat this time around. The last last time I went they were stingy with the meat, but this time the meat came VERY quickly. The server was also more than happy to get more for us, not \"omg my beef\" on us. In general, for a Chinese establishment, the service was A-OK!

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
The norm for AYCE hotpot.

Brownie Points 3.5/5 (10% of final grade)
They has my favourite hotpot dish in plain display to grab as much as I want -- WATERCRESS. This won my heart over quickly, because I ate lots of this and they replenished the supply quite quickly as well. The deep fried buns with the condensed milk on the side was also SO GOOD. 

Final Grade = 72/100 = 4  Stars

TLDR:  If you love watercress and fresh meat with your hotpot, then swing by. Call before though, because the last last time I came they didn't have it. I was tetter-tottering between 3 and 4 stars, but decided that the watercress, fresh meat, and deep fried buns dipped in condensed milk were enough to push me from a 3 star to a 4 star."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the reviews here with the fact that their service is bad. It must have taken 20-30 minutes for us to get our broth. Extra napkins were requested and not given until I had to follow up. I asked to get a pitcher of water so I didn't have to constantly ask for refills and was told by (I think it was a manager) that she would bring it to my table and she never did. Like Kimberley N's review, I came on a weekend during lunch and was told I had to pay the dinner price which did not make sense so I pointed out to the waitress that their menu has a lunch price and a dinner price and if it's a weekend/holiday, it's a dollar more. Only then the waitress agreed mentioning as long as we don't order a dinner menu item, which of course is a given. I do not recommend this place but as it's the only hot pot restaurant in Mississauga, I guess Mississauga residents have no choice unless they want to drive to the east end."}
{"text":"I have been to this chain in many different cities, provinces, states and countries and must say that the consistency is amazing!

The broth's and meat quality seems to transcend borders and wherever you go, the food always hots the spot!

As usual, you can always mix two broths in one bowl with a divider in the middle.  This is great for those that like spicy but prefer it as an occasional bite I moderation rather than your entire meal.

If you head over for an all you can eat style meal I suggest you fast for a day before lol

The food is amazing and the only reason I ever stop eating is because my feeble human body keeps limiting my input! 

All in all, this review is coming from a guy that generally hates soup and I am still giving it a 5/5 and recommending anyone that wants to try hot pot to five it a shot here. Your tummy will thank you!"}
{"text":"I finally tried out Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot after a decade of living very very close to this location. I used one of the groupon deals that gave my table some credit towards the bill, which was good. The selection of toppings and food here is pretty good. I think the concept of getting up to get your own food is kinda cool. My favourite items were the spam, sausages and fish balls, all of which tasted great. The drink items could have been better; the restaurant should add better beverage options for customers. Overall, a solid hotpot restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service. They have lunch discounts and Groupons for dinner AYCE. Besides the hotpot menu, they also have a snack bar (with zha mantou + condensed milk, spring rolls,etc), a juice fountain (with soy milk and plum juice), and a self-serve sauce bar where you can mix your own.

The spinach noodles were great. If you order meat, get the regular beef and/or lamb. However, DO NOT get the \"garlic beef/pork;\" it was a mashed ball of formless texture-less meat mash. Be warned.

They charge extra for all the broths (even the basic one!), but the lunch discount or Groupon help! It's actually less pricey than Chine or Celebrity."}
{"text":"Found this place via an insauga article that appeared on my Facebook feed. I had heard about Mongolian hot pot, and always wanted to try same, but never found a place that did same. The insauga review was favourable, and so I decided to go try it. This place can be accurately described as a Korean bbq type idea, but you boil everything in a pot instead of cooking it on a grill. It is a lot of fun, and works well for get together,  dates, etc. They have two types of bases to cook in, one sweet and the other spicey. They gave a large pot with both using a separating wall in the middle  called Ying Yang. However, I reccomend the spicey base as it is not excessively hot and makes the rest taste better. They have a small table with additional sauces, etc: you can add more hot sauce, chilli oil, etc. I would suggest going for the dinner menu as the various meatballs, etc are worth the extra bit. The dumplings are excellent. They have more noodles types than I can remember. They also have several types of mushrooms, etc. The sweet corn comes out well when put in the spicey base. There are so odd things on the menu such as cow stomach and pigs blood, but if your boat, enjoy! I had no idea what I was doing,  so I threw everything into the pot, and it came out well. Overall,  this place is a fun place to go, and the food quality is excellent. I was surprised to find out it is a franchise from the US,  and not a one off. They are doing an excellent job."}
{"text":"Although this is the restaurant I go to most often, I wouldn't say it's the best one around. The floor is often slippery and the windows are often steamed (you don't really feel the lack of ventilation, but you can see it and smell it from your clothes).

I still rate this as 3 stars because their lamb is delicious. I always order at least 3 plates of lamb (best lamb ever). Personally I don't think their other meats are worth eating, but that's just me.

They have an average selection of food that is served buffet-style. In my experience, most of the food (aside from the veggies) are not exactly -delicious-, but bearable. They have a table of sauces where you can customize your own, and you obtain your own drinks through the machines. Note that the drinks are disgusting... the soymilk and plum juice are often too sweet, and the iced tea is just gross.

You have a choice of a big pot to share with your friends, or small individual pots (which I love). They have a few soup bases you can choose from, but I always go with the free one -- and it's actually pretty good considering they put in quite a few Chinese herbs.

In summary, eat here only if you are in love with their lamb. Everything else is shitty (mind you, the branch in Mississauga is great). Otherwise, there are a lot of better choices out there."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration. Reservations had been made and we were seated as soon as we arrived even though we were a bit late. 

The food- the food was fantastic! We all had individual hot pots to cook our items. My boyfriend and I shared so the table wouldn't be so crowded. We had both the regular and spicy broth although we both preferred the spicy broth. We had ordered lamb and beef, the lamb was amazing! We had visited Mongolian hot pot before but were total noobs when it came to hot pot, we had over cooked everything and didn't really enjoy it. This second time around we knew better and loved it! We cooked most of the items bit by bit like the lamb, which you only need to stick them in for about a few seconds, and other items like the radish I stuck them in for a while once I pulled them out they were soft, but not falling apart, and had soaked up all that spicy broth goodness. All the ingredients provided were clean and fresh, couldn't have asked for anything better! 

The service- okay I go to Chinese restaurants on the regular but never have I ever had such friendly service. We were all so shocked and couldn't stop talking about it and thanking our waiters for being so nice and attentive. The only time we needed to call our waiters attention was when we needed an extra bowl for a sauce or another glass. Our broths were constantly kept topped up and they provided us with 2 sets of chopsticks and plenty of napkins. As you all know you don't typically go to a Chinese spot for service but for the food. 

Overall- food wad delicious and service was fantastic! Most definitely worth coming to this place!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying hot pot. Spicy hot pot is too hot to drink as a soup - way to many red chillies in there. The beef strips, lamb balls and the fresh veggies were the best. Shrimps were good quality too. Chicken was just OK. Didn't like the texture. Good selection of condiments although we really just stuck to sesame paste. Almost $60 after tax and tip for two people. Interesting experience but seemed like too much work to cook for yourself in a restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown Toronto one and recently visited this uptown Scarborough location. Both have its good points and downside, depends on which you prefer.

This Little Sheep location is more or less a fully self-served restaurant. Right off the bat the moment I sat down, two plates of raw lamb and one plate of raw beef was set on the table - super efficient!

Besides from the meat, customers like myself, will need to pick your own food using the plate on the table. The food varies from different types of meatballs or seafood balls to squid and spam, veggies and noodles. Variety was decent but I think downtown had a bit more. I was sad they didn't have my favourite quail eggs (which the downtown spot does).

Service was good. When we waited for a table, the waiters were pleasant and came by every so often to ensure our table is ready soon. Keep in mind, they serve two styles: one big pot split or our own personal small hot pot.

Experience was nice, nothing major and out of the world. Generally a good place to relax and have some shabu shabu time while chatting with others!"}
{"text":"I got the opportunity to return again to give this page a chance. The manager said the employees have been retrained.

The service has indeed improved A LOT! There's more staff in the floor, and they actually check up on you. They take initiative to ask if you want to order your next round or just drop by to refill the soupbase. It's also easy to call for service now as well. Food came out really fast too.

One thing that irked me a little: I love mantou (deep fried bun), and these are only good when it's fresh. Since we arrived all the way til we're ready for dessert (a good 2 hrs), the batch of mantou was just sitting there and never changed. So when we tried one, it was cold and pretty hard already. I told the server about it, and if they can make a fresh batch since it's been sitting there. The server told me that since there's still mantous left in the existing batch then we'll have to wait til it finishes. I was like: are you serious? That batch is not good anymore and
 you want people to eat that? The server said she'll check with the manager, and they did change it.

I think those food in the buffet items need to be reconsidered. Maybe make it order by request so it's guaranteed fresh or they need to have a freshness timer where they need to replace any existing batch after 1 hour. Otherwise, nobody's going to eat that.

Aside from the hiccup with the mantou, I really enjoyed my experience here now. The food itself was never really an issue for me here. So if they can make that level of service consistent, it would be a great hotpot place to keep visiting."}
{"text":"This was my first time at hot pot and honestly I really loved it. I think I enjoyed it more than Korean BBQ, which I also really love. The meats were all flavourful, thinly shaved, and tender, the extras provided lots of options, eggs, tofu, veggies, etc, and the noodles, which came in many varieties, were all soft and very fresh. My 3 stars is coming from the service, it was terribly, terribly slow. We ended being here for 3 hours for dinner. They mixed up our orders a couple times. We had to place orders second times on more than one occasion. And we even had to wait quite a while in a line to pay."}
{"text":"I was always hesitant to try until now because I heard from someone who went the second day this location opened that the service wasn't very good. 

When you arrive, they ask you if you want single pots or a large pot. The pot we chose was the large yin yang pot (half and half) for $5. The spicier side of the soup was slightly too salty. You have to pay extra for the soy milk and sour plum tea. I didn't enjoy this since having unlimited drinks is part of the hot pot experience. They do provide you with lemon water which is good, but the water tasted soapy. 

The server that seated us seemed quite confused when we ordered the soup and water. It took quite a while for servers to come by and take our food orders. However when we asked for refills on the side dishes, they were quick to get back to us. I do have to say that the side dishes were a plus, and were very delicious. It included pork bone in a sweet sauce, seaweed with garlic, and potato sticks with chili sauce. They were all very flavourful. 

I did notice at a table next to us, that they had a laminated menu with pictures of all the AYCE food items. However, the server didn't give that to us. We only received the paper food ordering sheet. 

The sauce station is clean and organized, where you can mix your own sauces. The seating was comfortable and table space was perfect for two people sitting in a four seater with a large pot. However, if four people were to sit, it would get squishy with the food and everyone's plates and bowls.

The food was plated nicely and was fresh. The handmade noodles were surprisingly good. They were nice and chewy, unlike other restaurants that state handmade noodles on the menu and they give you something totally different. The downside to this location is that you have to order the food, drinks aren't included, and you can only order dessert once (stated on the food ordering sheet). However, for the Scarborough location, the food, soy milk and sour plum tea, as well as desserts are all self serve and unlimited. One thing I found interesting was having steamed white rice in the dessert section. 

The food is decent, but the pricing on drinks and split of lunch and dinner items are a bit much. Given that Mississauga doesn't have many hot pot places, this is a decent location to satisfy your hot pot craving."}
{"text":"Hot pot is my Favorite, and it is a buffet! All you can eat! 5 ppl eat $140. Beef lamb chicken breast, tofu, tofu puffs, mushroom, vegetables are all the best.  We ordered the two in one hotpot with hot on the side and mild on the other."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. And every time I'm here most of the plates are not clean. I went today and all the plates on the table had some residue on it. I love the broth here but it's really not sanitary here."}
{"text":"After going to so many other hot pot places I realized little sheep still has a special place in my heart. But now I know to not go there when it's super busy and understaffed- Saturday and Sunday lunch times. Otherwise all is good."}
{"text":"The waitresses here are so stingy with giving out meats like lamb and beef. We had to ask 3 different waitresses in order to get some lamb. They only give you one plate at once even though we had a group of 6. And when we asked again for the lamb, she goes \"didn't we just give you lamb?\" Like they expect a group of 6 to just have one little plate of lamb? This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Mongolian Hot Pot is an average hot pot restaurant. All food is ordered AYCE style off of a menu. The quality of meat is low in general (however ordering the garlic beef will get you a higher quality piece). It is an interesting concept but hot pot at home is way better. The advantage here is the variety. Beef, lamb, porkchops, tripe, you name it. They have it. 

There is a help yourself sauce cart which has many different ingredients you can add to create your own sauce concoction. I added sesame paste, cilantro, chili oil and sesame oil to create mine but the combinations are endless. Overall, the price of this restaurant is much better than other hotpot restaurants at about 22 dollars per person (I've paid over $30 at some places). I also ordered the spicy soup base which was a few dollars more but is worth it if you enjoy that numb feeling and chili taste (this base is definitely not something you'd easily do at home thus is worth it). Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here given that I can make much tastier and satisfying hotpot at home but it may be worth it to check out at least once."}
{"text":"Not bad. I really enjoyed the sauce variety! Dessert choices need major improvement. I would visit again. Service was decent!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Little Sheep in Montreal all the time, and I decided to give this one a try.  To my surprise it was a lot better and there seemed to be far more selection than the one in Montreal.  The servers are about the same and only come by your table when you wave them down.  That's to be expected though as this place gets super busy.  Don't even bother coming with a group without making a reservation, as the wait times are very long.  Even with a reservation our group still had to wait in excess of 20-30 minutes on a weekend.

The food here is typical with your meats, veggies and select sea food.  The lamb and beef which is not self serve are usually fresh and taste great.  The meat on the shelves though, are usually a bit more rough looking, and sometimes the trays need to be cleaned a bit more as I've seen some funky cross contamination happening in many of the food trays.

Overall for the price and value you can't really compare with anything else in the GTA.  This place is busy for a reason, it offers great value with nice food and the call you can drink area is a nice touch.  Try mixing the orange pop with coke, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"There used to be 2 hot pot restaurants in Montreal, and this one definitely caused the other one to close down.  Little Sheep is a franchise that has restaurants across the world and they never disappoint with their buffet style dinners.  The soup here is great if you order the spicy or regular.  There are tons of options in terms of meat, sea food, veggies and animal innards as well if you're looking to be adventurous.  The food is of course raw you cook it yourself, so you can't really comment on the quality that much.  Most of the food is fresh, and there has been a few rough looking shrimps and veggies I've seen from time to time.

Service is pretty good here as well, the servers get your beef and lamb out pretty fast as long as you ask for it in advance.  They also have a self serve drink area where you can fill up with various pops, soy bean milk and plum juice.  The desserts are basically a couple of cakes and fried dough, but that's not the reason you come to hot pot.

My only real issue with the place is that they sometimes clean the floors as people are eating.  The smell of that mop water is seriously harsh and a turn off to people eating.  I would give it another half star if I didn't have to smell that at least a few times since I've been going here."}
{"text":"The advertised  prices (eg lunch buffet of $15) does NOT include the price of the broth. So expect to pay an extra $2-3pp for the broth. 

Pros:
-Service is friendly. Our waiter could speak English
-Meat quality is better than some of the other ayce hot pot places
-Ice cream is good
-Fairly large range of food
-Food comes out very quickly

Cons: 
-As mentioned, false advertising with the prices
-I personally find this a con, but you need to order the food from the menu and they bring it to you. You can order up to 3 rounds of food. I prefer to just grab the food myself, so I have a better idea of what's available"}
{"text":"The service was awful. The cashier was rude and wouldn't explain the bill while I had questions. And they forced to add tips to the bill even thought I was planning to tip more than they added. They should really train their employees better and tell them to respect the customers. Awful place and I'll never go back again. I'll definitely suggest all my friends not to go to such a terrible place."}
{"text":"Little Sheep is a safe choice for hot pots, if you are a fan. The variety of food is great and they are somewhat well stocked. The place should be a lot cleaner though, so both ventilation and floor cleaning should be stepped up, it does feel like being in a sauna."}
{"text":"Nice service and meat. Affordable although the option for the base and food is not as much As other all you can eat buffet. Free snack and drinks. I love the soy milk and fried bun very much."}
{"text":"Came here for my mom's bday last night as it was my first time here. All you can eat hot pot with 21.99 a person and the selection of broth is extra. We decided to do have original and half spicy broth. I found that the spicy broth had way too much cut up chili peppers in it.. way over done. When you are scooping your food out of the broth all you get are pepper, i found it quite annoying. I would recommend just sticking with original broth. Each table has only 1 cooking stovetop and for a large pot it has a divider that splits into 2 for the different broths. We have 4 ppl dining so I think the size was perfect. They have a diy sauce station in the middle of the restaurant for dipping your meats and veggies. You mark down your selection from the menu list and they bring it to your table. The good thing was that they have a Groupon offer on right now for $40 off"}
{"text":"This place is a great value for what you get or a \"good bang for your buck\". They're very decent about if you want to change your broth from spicy to mild. Only 2.50 charge which is a great deal. You have all you can eat meat and items for your pot which gets extra points in my book!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pretty genuine, tastes right! Price is reasonable, I love you can have ice cream at the end of dinner.

???????????"}
{"text":"I really like this hot pot place. Buffet style raw bar, and they have even added some desserts, spring rolls and various other deep fried items. I too think the spicy broth is way too spicy but man it clears your sinuses out better than a neti pot!!!!!

I enquired to see if they would be opening up downtown (so I can avoid a 1.5 hr each way ttc ride to get any sort of hot pot). They are looking in to opening a smaller location in Chinatown. I clicked my heels and rejoyced, I've been waiting 5 years for a hot pot place downtown!! Little sheep is one of the best."}
{"text":"Okay heads up, whenever i eat hot pot, i HAVE to have beer with it and this place will not give you your beer unless you ask the same server and like multiple servers 50 times, for a single bottle of beer. Not cool. 

The soup broth was nice but I've had better. I really like the original non spicy one more than the spicy one, I would recommend it if you'd like to give this place a try.

There are a lot of options for food like pigs blood and tripe and lamb dumplings which I thought were really great. You have to order the meat by word from servers instead of on the paper lol? Also they serve wierd snacks like canned tangerines, wonton spring rolls, and custard rolls. Self serve soy milk and water.

But overall since the service lacked alot of english and I had to ask for my beers too many goddamn times, I will not be returning. Celebrity hotpot is alot better if you want an actual enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"After having a not so great experience at their downtown location, one of the managers of Little Sheep reached out to me to apologize for my experience and suggest that I try out their Scarborough location which is presented in a different way. A way I was hoping for from their downtown location.

All of my former criticisms were washed away after visiting Little Sheep's Scarborough location. The soup brother was more flavourful and they have a refrigerated wall of raw ingredients that you can self-serve from that they don't have downtown. Meat is still brought out to you as requested which was just fine by my standards.

Also important was that the service uptown was WAY faster, courteous, and everyone here had a big smile. It looked like the staff uptown were all having fun with their jobs rather than simply grinding out customers. :)

I can confidently say that Little Sheep up in Scarborough is now one of my top choices for AYCE hot pot! One word of warning, their spicy soup is SUPER SUPER spicy so you should only get it if you can handle the heat. ;)"}
{"text":"So I came here on a Saturday with my boyfriend 
They gave us option if we wanted to share a pot or have separate ones. There was also an option to have regular or spicy or both
The selections of meats, veggies and seafood was of wide range which was awesome. 
The broth itself was just right. 
When I got the bill, they charged me $6 extra for having separate pots which i didn't know about
My bill came down to $60~ which I felt was really expensive for hotpot 
That night, i woke up twice really dehydrated. I think they added a lot of MSG and salt in their broth
Overall 3 stars because it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"Scarborough location is waaaay better. Here in sauga location they'll give you paper to check which one you are ordering. Scarborough location though has more freedom when it comes to choosing the food and no rush, no need to call the server multiple times"}
{"text":"Oh Little Sheep, I really wish you were better than you are. 

I've been trying to find a good all you can eat hot pot place in Toronto ever since ICook Buffet closed a while ago. 

I love soup, I love all you can eat and the two combined have the potential for a heavenly dining experience.

Little Sheep was not the answer to my prayers. While it is all you can eat and the ingredients were ok, I really wasn't happy with my experience. The broth was bland and there were very few spice/sauce/flavoring options to change the situation. While ICook had a refrigerated wall of ingredients that you could go and pick from yourself, Little Sheep has a menu that you must order from and you'll never quite know the exact quantity and quality of ingredients that you'll get.

We ended up way over ordering and had to suffer down all that we got so as not to piss off the establishment with wasted food. We will never come back here and unless you have low standards for this kind of food, you probably shouldn't bother coming here yourself."}
{"text":"6/10 stars for the food, 9/10 for the services. 8/10 overall (not an average).

Just came back from there. There was a good variety of food, but the quality was only so so. Most of the balls (beef tendon balls, fish balls, lamb balls, etc) were not that great (whereas I couldn't get enough of the beef tendon balls at Hipot!). The beef and lamb were good. We went at 9:30pm when their closing time was 11pm, and I think they didn't bother refilling some of the \"self-serve\" items, like the beef tripe.

Though the food was only so so, I was impressed with their services. Compared to the garbage services we received at Kim Tao (you can read my review of them), the servers at this place was great, and this one gentleman named Wen Zal (I think, his name tag was slightly obscured) deserves high praises. We asked him if they were going to refill the beef tripe at the self-serve area, he said that they would. Later, he came back to ask if we were able to get any beef tripe, we told him we didn't, and he personally got us a plate of them. To me, that was some impressive service. This man deserves an award.

One downside is that when they were clearing the plates, there was a lot of loud clanking. Not that big a deal tho. One other downside is they don't open late. I want to come here for cheaper late night meals."}
{"text":"So so good. I have hot pot around the world this is the best I have had, and it's all you can eat! The house made tofu is so delicate and silky smooth, this restaurant is in my top three favorite restaurants I have ever had"}
{"text":"Hot pot in sauga, finally. Woo woo!

They recently opened but it was already pretty full around 1:30pm on Saturday. The owners were still doing some small adjustments to the sign, so we heard some drilling but its OK. We paid most attention to the food, music and each other.

Weekend price is approximately $22 per person which is technically the same price as weekday dinner. We also ordered a round of soy milk, which was $1.50, and we even had to pay extra for the soup which I thought usually is included. The prices were strange but not a huge deal.

The atmosphere was casual and open. I liked the music because they played top 40. The stove tops came in two styles, 1) stove per person, or 2) shared. We were seated at the single stoves but I'm sure you could share if you want, just got to ask.

I ordered the spicy broth...and wow was I surprised at how spicy it was. Before you say \"well it does say spicy\", from my experience, normal spicy isn't spicy for me. The spicy broth had soooo many many red peppers, my nose kept running haha. It still tasted delicious. They offer the usuals that other hot pot places do. 

The food, service and atmosphere was great. 

So glad this place opened up! I don't have to go far for some delicious hot pot. :) I'll definitely go here again, but probably will try the \"clear\" broth next time."}
{"text":"My experience was interesting,

Service was 10/10 very friendly and amazing I have zero complaints on that 

I generally just didn't like the food. It wasn't for me. 

This place is worth trying but is NOT cheap. 

you're literally ordering different foods to boil in a boiling pot of spicy of neural soup broth.. 

the tastes were very unique and I had never heard of a lot of things that were in the broth. 

glad I Tried it but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Was really excited about eating here for my birthday party. The food was good and the place gets pretty busy. The experience was nice and it's fun to learn a new variation of Asian food. The cleanliness is a little off, but it's typical for Chinatown.

Having 3 teenagers with us, they barely ate because they read the sign about wasted food and became extremely cautious to the point where they pretty much skipped the food to eat ice cream and cake.

While I understand the concept of not wasting food, sushi buffets will charge you $1 per piece not eaten. This place will charge you a full $19 for 200 grams of wasted food. 

The whole concept of a buffet is that it's a way to try foods you would not normally eat, there is unfortunately going to be some waste, but I can say I have eaten at so many buffets now, that I can now know exactly when to stop and eat everything on my plate.

But a 15 year old or somebody who ogles the buffet and might be full earlier than expected should not be punished for that. Or somebody might pick an item and not like it.

I only made one trip to the raw food buffet and there are a lot of items i skipped because I had to eat more than my share of food since others could not finish.

My suggestion is to go with people who will eat a lot, and go for the lunch buffet, it's $12 instead of $19, my 2 star review is the Overall impression and as good as the food was, the lasting taste in my mouth is the poor wasted food policy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and beautiful. Only had the lunch menu but it was satisfying enough. Remember to purchase cold drinks and the non- hot pot items as a way to refresh your self from the hotpot. Waitresses r the best, they guided us through on our first time being there"}
{"text":"Great food but chaos in the kitchen!!!  Servers are trying hard to do their job.  Since it is all you can eat, they brought the same food for each table until we complaint.   Make sure you mark your order and follow through otherwise you will not get what you want but what they want to give you."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there to casually celebrate her birthday. It was my first time having Mongolian hot pot so I was really excited to see if it would taste as good as the other hot pots I've had. The place was super busy (we went on a Saturday), but we were seated right away because we didn't mind having our own individual hot pots instead of waiting for a table that had a massive one for both of us to share. I got the half regular/half spicy broth and OMG it was so delicious! My friend and I preferred the beef over the lamb and I was impressed with all the variety of foods in the buffet area. The only negative was that they lacked in dessert options but honestly, the meal was so delicious, I was beyond full anyways. I loved everything about the experience. The servers were all friendly and they were readily available to top up our broth or bring us more meat. I was really impressed with the service. Even though the place is far from where I live, I will for sure go back :)"}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant looks very clean, with nice black tiles, white walls, and white tables spread out throughout the space. The washrooms were also on par with the rest of the restaurant.

Tables are available for various party sizes. You have the option of choosing to share a large pot, getting your own individual pot, or a mix of both. Their large pots are quite large, which would be more cost-effective if you're used to cooperative hotpotting or survival of the fittest.

Up front they have the sauce station with 8 or so different sauces for you to mix and match. They also have a basket of eggs that you can use. There are also some sidedishes like potato strips, spicy cold noodles, spring rolls, or bread that you can take. You can also get some unlimited soy milk and plum juice.

When ordering slices of beef/lamb, you don't get to put your order down on the sheet; instead, you have to ask them for it. Fortunately, they give you quite a lot of it compared to some other hot pot places that skimp on the meats.

Also, you only get to order one round of ice cream (red bean or green tea, or both). Can't really say it's AYCE when you only get to have two bowls of ice cream, but I guess you can get unlimited soy milk and everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Had my all you can eat dinner here with my family to celebrate my sisters birthday- they never miss to keep our belly full, the taste, quality, quantity and service is always consistent. Down side I wish we don't have to line up to pay for the table, other than that me and my family will keep coming back. Best Mongolian hot pot so far I've been to in the city. Worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here many times at lunch with colleagues from a client site, and it was initially pretty solid. Lately, we've found that the selection is increasingly looking very spartan -- there are fewer choices and they get replaced less frequently, so sometimes it feels like you're picking through the leftovers of the people who came before you.

I would have recommended it before, now I'm hoping to find a better alternative."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with hot pot on a cold, windy day.
The four of us took advantage of their 8.99 lunch special which came with 2 plates of meat and 8 plates of additional dishes per person which were more than enough food for us to share.  Additionally, soft drinks are provided free of charge as a self service.
I was genuinely surprised by the good quality meat which was much better than expected considering the price and quantity of the food.

The service was very lousy though.  3 of our orders (beer, noodle, tofu) were forgotten until they were pointed out to the server.  I'd be understanding had the restaurant been packed and busy, but the place wasn't even half way filled, and at 3 servers were busy chatting in the corner rather than server the customers.  I would highly recommend taking a photo of your order menu so you can cross check against what they brought out to ensure you don't get screwed."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. 

First of all, the waiter spoke only Chinese to me even when we clearly do not. The waiter did not seem to care if we understand or not. As a result, we had to seat at a table of one stove so we were forced to share one pot. (I realized this later)

Second, my girl friend and myself had no experience in hot pot so we had no idea how to order or eat. The waiter paid very little attention to it and was very not helpful. He gave us very short instruction and showed minimal patience. He walked away without taking any questions. I had to call the waiter for questions multiple times when the restaurant was not busy at all. He was waiting only two tables including ours. 

Third, more importantly, even I clearly mentioned I have a Groupon to use, the waiter still let us order lunch menu which I cannot use the Groupon for. No explanations were there and he kept saying he said it when I was trying to use it. When I asked to talk to the owner, the manger kept saying the same thing. \"I'm the manager\". They neither took the Groupon nor gave me a single apology. This was the worst thing overall. 

The only reason why I did not give one star is that the food was okay. Meats, vegetables and noodles were fresh and broths were okay.  It was just the attitude of people there makes me never want to go back there again. Be warned before you visit. It is worse than you've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Le personnel est très accueillant et offre régulièrement d'ajouter du bouillon. L'endroit est calme, la déco sympa et c'est bien aéré. 
J'ai bien aimé mon repas. 
Il n'y a que deux choix de bouillon mais ils sont savoureux et parfumés. Le bouillon épicé n'est pas trop piquant. Les ingrédients sont frais et il y a beaucoup de choix. L'agneau est tendre et doux en bouche. 
Je n'ai pas trop aimé les boulettes d'agneau qui ont une texture granuleuse et un goût plutôt fade et industriel. 
Le choix d'ingrédients pour les sauces est basique mais correct. Les boissons incluses sont un plus. Comme je n'aime pas les boissons gazeuses, j'ai apprécié l'eau citronnée. 
Je pense que je retournerais mais le midi en semaine parce que le peu de choix de fruits de mer ne vaut pas la hausse de prix et c'est très achalandé le week-end donc c'est un peu difficile pour le stationnement."}
{"text":"We ordered buffet with separate hot pots. The base lamb soup was great. Many choices of fresh selections and sauces as well as few dimsum and drinks were included as part of the buffet. They brought the selections to the table on order. The place looked clean. Service was great."}
{"text":"Very spacious restaurant with tons of group seating. I prefer using the individual pots over a large shared one. Lots of fresh vegetables that you can pick yourself, along with a variety of noodles, different kinds of tofu, dumplings, fish cakes and fish balls and seafood. You have to get your beef and lamb through the waiter though. The broth is very tasty!

The place gets busy so I recommend coming early, and reservations for groups over 6. They also have a good lunch deal."}
{"text":"I spent time in China eating the real deal hot pot almost every week. When I came back, I sadly did not have a hot pot restaurant near my city. When I visited Toronto, I knew I had to try to find one!

I was not disappointed in Little Sheep Hot Pot! The flavors were exactly as I expected. I remember being a little timid on spiciness but if I went back I would have gotten it hotter. If you are use to Chinese hot pot, go for the spiciest! 

I went for lunch & it was not crowded or dirty. The service was good. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because there were a few ingredients I missed. I would have loved for there to be lotus root, Chinese leeks, & you tiao. Maybe they were just out when I went.

TL;DR- I love hot pot in China. This was pretty dang close & delicious."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a few weeks back with my friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. 
The restaurant was quite full, typical of what one will see for a Saturday evening in a Scarborough Chinese -run restaurant. They offer 2 choices of broth: Mild and Spicy; got the Mild one. I was thankful cause I found out from my friends who cause the spicy ones that it was very spicy. The selection of hot pot ingredients were plentiful, a good selection of vegetables, seafood and hot pot products, like Fishballs, bean curd. However, the food did not taste fresh although the restaurant said the food was freshly restocked the afternoon of.
Service was standard, nothing special or lacking. A little slow on clearing cutlery but otherwise typical of service in an AYCE.

Quite disappointing when we heard we (12 of us) were unable to split the bill. Each of us carried a variety of payment met such as cash, debit and credit. We were not informed by the staff nor on the menu of this policy. The best the restaurant did was that 6 of us share a bill. 

Overall, a mediocre dining experience. Not fresh food unclear policy, slightly below par service. Silver lining is a reasonable selection of hot pot ingredients for an ok price of 24.99++/person"}
{"text":"First off this is not your typical hot pot place. You sit at a table and get your own little pot rather than 1 large communal pot.  Although you can request for individual or communal pots.  Most people I saw had individual pots.  The self serve food stations are unique where you can simply go and take as much ingredients for your hot pot as you like.  You can order unlimited beef and lamb from the servers and they have a variety of foods.

The quality of the food was okay, but you can tell that they need to make some improvements. They had Onion Rings, Spring Rolls, and some baked goods but they were all cold from sitting there in the open. There were even fruit flies sitting on the spring rolls.  They need to invest in a heat station or something that keeps the food hot.

The entire place is one big slip and slide.  It is super slippery and you need to be extra careful when walking around to get your food and drinks. There were 2 people that slipped in the exact same spot and the staff mopped it and put up a sign...really did not help.  However it was funny to watch people falling because you were just glad it was not you.  Nevertheless one day I am pretty sure the owner will smarten up and purchase some rubber mats for the floor or get everyone to wear some crocs. Haha!

Back to the food...it was decent but there are better places close to the area. The service was good and prices were right in line with AYCE hot pot."}
{"text":"I have been to Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot two times now and both experiences were decent.  

My favourite item on their menu is the shrimp as it was very fresh.  The homemade fish balls and shrimp balls were not very good however.  They fell apart easily and were mushy in texture.  Everything else such as the beef, lamb, pork and veggies were good, but typical.  

The service in my opinion was exceptional for a Chinese place, as the servers were very polite and helpful.  Food came out quickly and our drinks were always refilled without having to ask.  However, the place was very empty during my last visit, so that may explain why I had such attentive service.  

They were also doing a promotion where you get bottomless soy milk and plum juice for free if you pay in cash.  I thought that was a pretty sweet deal!"}
{"text":"-Greeted at the door, and introduced to the menu and how it works
-There's an option of a single pot, a big sharing pot, or a big sharing pot with 1/2 n 1/2 flavors, each priced accordingly 
-Both the clear and spicy soup base were very flavorful, and in my opinion better than most hot pot places
-A plate of lamb is brought out per person at the table, and more can be requested upon finishing. There is also beef upon request as well
-Self-service kind of dining, gather the raw ingredients and cook it at your table
-There's also a sauce station with a good variety of sauces
-Bottomless Pop, Soy-Milk, and Plum Juice is included in the price 
-Ingredients were to standard, and it'll be good for anyone looking just to have basic hot pot without the fancy stuff
-Service is above standard espcially in this kind of establishment, be polite to the staff and they'll be surprisingly twice as polite back to you
-Empty plates were periodically cleared off, soup base was topped of with broth and not water, and stations were constantly being restocked and cleaned. Again very friendly and efficient service
-I would skip the desserts as they aren't the greatest
-Bathroom was clean and stocked
-When we were leaving, the staff politely gave us a farewell and wished us a good evening
-Overall decent food, excellent service and decently clean

Damage=$60 for 2 people with a big pot with split flavors, tax and a generous tip that their team deserves

***THERE WAS NO GRATUITY ADDED TO THE BILL

REPEAT:YES over a lot of the Hot Pot places on Hwy7

Good Job Guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy busy the night we went.  Luckily I had a reservation, but it still took a little while to get our seats.

I like the downtown location of Little Sheep a little more than this one, but it's fairly standard hot pot.  It's mostly self serve, but you do have to order the beef and lamb so you can get rationed.

Love the individual pots, so you can dump in whatever you want and don't have to worry about your friend \"stealing\" your food, or if anyone has any kind of food allergies.

Anyways, solid hotpot experience."}
{"text":"Dreadful snow storm here in Canada calls for a warm bowl of soup and that's when hot pot comes into action. We order the yin and yang broth- one large pot , half spicy and half regular broth. There was a huge selection of sliced meats like beef, lamb, pork , chicken . The broth itself was very flavourful and would very much warm you up. There was a variety of vegetables and noodles as well. There we even a dipping sauce station where you can help yourself and mix your own chilli sauce with peppers and green onions to your liking. 

Dinner price was $21.00 and was very worth it. 

Here's how it works:
1) order the broth - spicy or regular or a large pot of half spicy , half regular .
2)pick your sliced meats - beef, lamb, chicken, pork.
3)you have three rounds to pick any assortment of vegetables , noodles , wonton, meat balls , tripe, and more to go in your broth. It's all up to you. 

Overall it was a great experience. 
The place is huge and can seat up to 210 customers."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the line was long to get seated, even at 8:30PM on a Saturday.

The ordering system was a bit weird. When we gave our second order, they brought us the wrong order, and then ignored us when we told them so. 

It appeared as if around 10PM, the servers stopped working. They deliberately ignored us (perhaps to make people finish faster). At this point, we were trying to check out, but the line to check out (no, they don't bring you the bill) was about 6 families long. Each paid with credit card, but it seemed like we waited for 30 minutes before we got to pay. The line was reminiscent of what we went through at customs!"}
{"text":"Come early unless you want to wait...and I mean like 5:00 PM early.
Luckily, my group arrived just before 5:30 PM and there were plenty of spots. We were quite a big group - 9 people. The servers were really kind and provided us with options as we couldn't squeeze into one table. As a result, we took up a table with 6 stove tops plus another table with 4. There was a bit of confusion at the beginning and being an inexperienced hot potter myself, I wasn't much help.
They were discussing whether the stoves were made for a mini, solo pot or a larger dual-soup base pot. The server clarified that it's really up to us and they can make either or work. We ended up doing one mini pot per person. 
This place has quite a huge selection including homemade dumplings, homemade fish balls, mountains of beef and lamb slices, as well as a buffet-style island by the entrance. This area was where you could create your sauce, pick up some deep fried buns, cold dishes, and spring rolls. You can also refill your soy milk, water, or plum juice. These were frequently replenished and the space remained fairly clean. 
To my surprise, the service was much better than what I expected. The servers worked very quick, jumping from table to table, refilling low soup bases, picking up plates, dropping off requested dishes, etc. 
Be aware that like any other restaurant, there is a gratuity for large parties. Although the regular price for weekday dinner was $21.99, not including the soup base ($2.50), my total was about $33. In general, I'm not a big fan of hot pot as it's really something you can do at home (with the right ingredients). 

Tips
-Don't fill yourself with the buns and spring rolls...remember you paid for AYCE 
-Be conscious of what you're ordering! Don't waste food! 
-Beef and lamb slices can be ordered through your server directly instead of the sheet (subject to changes)"}
{"text":"When I reviewed this place online and from other reviews, I thought this was a typical Mongolian restaurant.  You know, raw meat, veggies, and noodles that you choose to your liking and a sauce to compliment for a taste truly your own, bring to a giant wok and have someone braving 7 foot flames to stir fry it all for you.

It was....kinda/sorta.

You DO pick out your raw faves, but the selection was so much more vast.  Veggies included Taro, Kale, Pumpkin, Bok Chou and meats included lamb, beef, chicken, the hugest prawn I've ever seen. For a walk on the wild side, meats included chicken hearts and liver even tripe.  And for the starch-loving gal like me, why , 7 different types of noodles was akin to a choir of angles singing.

Instead of bringing it to the firefighting wok master, you instead bring all of the rarities to your table where a \"hot pot\" of broth is boiling happily on your own personal burner.  You can choose from regular, hot, or super spicy broth.  I'm a chicken, so it was an order of regular for me and my brave husband chose hot.  They bring the order \"yin/yang\" where you have a pot divided in two with your respective broth choices.  

Then, you drop in your fixings and wait for the bubbling action to cook your dinner, strain it, and garnish it with whichever dipping sauce you deem fit.

Essentially, it's fondue with an Asian twist.  And I'd never want Mongolian any other way.

If you're in Old Towne Montreal, this is a MUST.  It's close to the Metro and easy to recognize with the fuzzy sheep sign logo in green. (Most signs were red or yellow, so it stood out)

The restaurant was very clean, staff extremely polite and helpful, and the food was perfect.  I'm sending a snow of emails to get this chain (voted to 100 chains in China as well as one of the top 500 restaurants in a country that surely must have over a billion chains) in my neck of the woods.

Best. Experience. Ever."}
{"text":"Sssoooo ffuuuuulllll sssoooo mmuuccchhh Ffffooooddddd!!!  When the sign says \"all you can eat\" it means \"all you can eat\" ...however be aware that you are only allowed to order 3 rounds in your all you can eat adventure so make sure you order EVERYTHING in Round 1 and then order the stuff you want more of in round 2 and then in round 3 ---- if you make it that far you can order the remaining dishes on the menu or just repeat your orders.  

I highly suggest you come here wearing your sweatpants and baggy shirt that you can wash the smell of delicious hotpot and sauce off after you have indulged in Unlimited Beef, Lamb, Pork, Chicken, Squid, Tofu, Watercress, Dumplings, Quail eggs, and a ton of other veggies and meat dishes that go along with hot pot!

The price is decent for dinner $22.95 a person plus $2.50 for the pot... you can share a pot or get your own pot if you are greedy and prefer to committ gluttony on your own.  The service is quick, friendly, and better than you expect.

This place is MASSIVE and has seating for up to 210 people. It gets busy during dinner but I can tell you that it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Most hot pot places are about the same because you cook the food yourself. You make your own dipping sauce. Since you cook things yourself, you can't complain about their chef's skills. So it boils down to their selection and quality of selection. 

That said, I enjoyed Little Sheep a lot. Their selection is pretty standard. You can find all the usual meat/fish balls, veggies, beef/lamb slices. They also have unlimited soft drinks, soy milk, and plum juice which is a nice plus since not every store offers these for free.

The decor is nice and they use what I think is called a convection heater. Service is above average for an Asian place.

Price wise it's fair for an all you can eat place. $20 base, plus extra charge for soup base. 

I would come again."}

The food was great, freshly sliced meat unlike most places that use frozen and the broth they use is delicious. My favourite thing was probably the Lamb.

I would've gave more stars if the service was better, they forgot to bring out some items EVERYTIME I ordered, They also have a appetizer table with a bunch of cold and disgusting looking appetizers buffet style."}
{"text":"Was craving hotpot, came here, wasn't impressed after the meal, came here again 2 days later, still wasn't impress.

What can I say, it's one of those basic chinese hotpot (and yes I said chinese despite the name of this place). You got the basic meat options: beef, chicken, lamb (the marinated ones weren't so good and takes forever to cook in comparison). You got the veggies: green stuff, etc. Nothing screams \"oh I gotta try that!\" There wasn't much seafood options, since I guess seafood is expensive in Toronto. 

If you want to try actual Mongolian dishes, that's an extra few bucks per dishes.
Oh, and they have a sauce station where you can make your own sauce which is nice."}
{"text":"This has been my tried and true hot pot location. They are very busy during dinner hours, whether it be weekdays or weekends, so unless you've called in for reservations, don't expect to get a seat right away.

This place serves only two broth options: spicy or regular. They do also give you the option of having the split pot as well. Flavour of the broth is aromatic and packed full of flavour. The spicy broth is not too spicy, but it does give a kick. As you boil down the pot overtime, the flavours do become more dense, but rest assured, the staff will help top your pot off with water/broth to so that you can continue eating.

For the beef and lamb slices, you will have to order by the plate. However, there's an area in the restaurant where you can get veggies, meats, assorted meat/fish balls, seafood, miscellaneous foods, condiments, desserts and non-alcohol beverages. The area is a bit small, but there's definitely lot of foods to choose from. 

Service wise, they are relatively quick with your meat orders, given how busy they are with other customers. One improvement could be seating number and arrangements - they often underestimate the amount of time it takes for a table to leave and for the staff to clean up, giving the next customers a specific wait time that is often not met. 

This place is perfect for the fall and winter weathers - it's definitely a hearty meal and warms the body. Looking forward to going there again!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Had the ying  yang hotpot. The hot soup was pretty spicy but filled with flavour. Same with the clear broth. 

Lots of meat, veggies and various types of noodles. I'm really impressed with this place!"}
{"text":"Super bon, à volonté, que demander de mieux!
Il y a du boeuf, de l'agneau, la viande est très bonne. Les légumes aussi, j'ai adoré les champignons! Il y a aussi des nems à volonté comme entrée, des sauces pour accompagner et quelques petits desserts...
Service ok, pas fou ms ça passe
Ils rajoutent régulièrement de l'eau et du bouillon dans les pots, c'est appréciable..
Avec l'alcool, ça revient quand même assez cher en bout de ligne
Il y a des groupons disponibles, n'hésitez pas à checker!"}
{"text":"Good service, buffet always stocked with food and their sauce station is awesome. The broths are very flavourful and food quality is pretty good. The only downside: food selection isn't as big as other hot pot places I've been too."}
{"text":"Ok hotpot, somewhat close to the real thing. Not very clean. The only reason I go there is because of the lack of alternatives in Montreal. The one in Brossard is somewhat better."}
{"text":"I haven't found a good hot pot joint until now!
Everything was super flavourful and the staff was very attentive! 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update: 
I've come here twice after posting my initial review. They have gotten so much better! Perfect 5 stars! The only disappointing thing was I wish the sauce station was abit more extensive and drinks like soy milk and plum juice was included. 

Overall excellent food, delicious broth and great environment!


Original review:
This place is interesting to say the least. 

First off let me start by saying they are clean and the food is delicious. However - for the price I did expect much more - similar to other hot pot places I've been. 

Food:
The food selection was ok - it wasn't very well organized but still quite sizable.
The quality was good for the most part, some vegetables you could see we're not fresh and had wilted abit. 
The two broths were very nice however I would not recommend drinking them as a soup with your noodles as the salt content is  insanely high. 
The menu claims three rounds tops but I was specifically told it was unlimited so not to worry. 
I must say - their dessert- deep fried bun with condensed milk is omg amazing. I actually ate bites of green tea ice cream with it and it was one of the most delicious morsels. 
Lastly - their sauce station is a joke. The sauces aren't properly labeled, the selection is poor and it's very poorly put on a moving table cart. 

Service:
This is why I've docked 2 stars. I was disappointed. 
First - when you have a table - one that requires food brought to them often - you need to keep an eye on them. It was quite tiresome to see waiters constantly walk by me and meanwhile our water was empty, our food for that round was over and we had a stack of dishes piled high with no one to clear it till I flagged someone down. 
Two - please - I don't consider it allot to go around every 20 minutes or so to refill your table's soup pot since they do tend to reduce when boiling rapidly. In addition - I don't consider it asking two much for someone to go around refilling water or just popping by to ask us if we need anything let alone keep an eye on us. 

Restaurant:
It baffles my mind when as a restaurant you are not able to properly provide forks, ladles to serve the broth into the bowls you provided let along tongs to place the food into the pot. I was told they could get me a pair of chopsticks if I wasn't comfortable touching raw meat/seafood with my chopsticks and then eating with it. TONGS! This restaurant needs to invest in tongs. 
One thing I did notice is this restaurant does not steam up the windows and smell as strongly as re other hot pot places I've been to. 

Pricing:
This is where this restaurant gets you. Weekend dinner is $23.99 however you are charged per pot that you use. In addition - drinks are not included which is odd because at other places for the same price drinks are all you can drink. In addition, they offer \"sides\" that are not actually part of the menu and are priced separately. I thought this a little ridiculous in my opinion.

Overall - though the service wasn't the best - the food met most of my expectations.
I can't say I'll be back any time soon but if I do get another hot pot craving and for some reason I really cannot drive to Toronto to get delicious, organized hot pot with great service, best variety of meats, vegetables etc. then I would certainly come to this location. 

I was really excited for this restaurant - it was worth going but I feel like I was let down over things that the location can very easily fix if they wanted to."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's so monoglian about it, except that they have some different \"herbal soups\" including one for \"affectionate couples\". (I'm not sure what the chinese read, but I'm sure it means something!)

However, it was pretty good. AYCE style, where they bring you beef and/or lamb as requested to the table. 
There is a an supermarket area at the back (a bit small and crowded) where you can get [insert meat here] balls, seafood, veggies, mushrooms and make your sauce. 

Be sure to try the chive sauce, mixed in some soy sauce. The Soy sauce was really salty. I added a lot of sugar. The chive sauce dampened it a little. 

You cook your foods in the individual pots they give you with soup. And then you continue to eat to your heart's content!

The service is quick and friendly. They all speak mandarin, and surprisingly most had a fairly good understanding of English, so don't get intimidated. 

There were huge line ups at the door, but they take reservations. Highly recommended. 

$16.99 + $1 (weekends) + optional soup size/flavour charge
$12.99 for lunch

It's so interesting that this place is offering 30% off to all bills until Oct 31st, which is the same date my Groupon expires! Hmmm coincidence, I think not. With the $20 for $40 I paid, it all evens out. 

It's okay, but I need more evidence of Mongolian, otherwise I can go to any hotpot place for more selection and potentially fresher food."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying hot pot at a restaurant- and it did not disappoint.

I like how they have a separate area for you to mix your own sauces, they have all the perfect sauces to mix 

There are many varieties of food to choose from (especially dinner), service is quite fast and efficient. The restaurant is spacious and clean.

The only thing is the price is kind of high after you choose your soup & add - ons.

Overall I would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big fan of hot pot at home, Little Sheep is well known for their soup as I only use their soup base for my hot pots. When I heard there was Little Sheep in Toronto I had to try it. 

PROS:
Soup is great, very authentic and delicious as expected

CONS:
Food; with the exception of beef and Lamb everything was self served. The buffet style stations were not the cleanest and could be much better, everything was layout in open refrigeration for easy access. Now everything look and tasted like a  Freezer Burn experience or rather Refrigeration Burn all to say the food was not freshly prepared. 
Over Sanitation from dining to restroom needs to be improved
Prices didn't not justify the overall dining experience

Little Sheep is Big in China but if they ever want to establish their reputation in Canada they need to step up their game. It is a great place for those who crave the tastes from back home. Personally I expected more from Little Sheep."}
{"text":"Came with a friend (Daniel T, see below) after trying to figure out what to eat.  Stepped outside into the cold and instantly though Hot Pot, can't go wrong.

The place is clean and surprisingly empty when we arrived.  

Like all AYCE hot pot places there's a station to make your delicious sauce concoction. Daniel T decided to mix it up with two different sauces.  

Service was good and quick.  The food that came was fresh and delicious, 2 rounds of everything.  Daniel T KO'd after the 2nd round and I was a bit disappointed we didn't go for a third round of food.  

When it's cold outside, it's time for hot pot and what better place to go than LIttle Sheep Mongolian.  Multiple return trips this winter is needed."}
{"text":"I love how their service is quick and there's a self serve station. Their beef, lamb and pork do not come frozen thank god.

One thing I hate is that the smell of hot pot lingers on your clothing and your hair. Make sure to wash your clothes once you go home!"}
{"text":"You won't be able to fully enjoy Little Sheep if you are not accompanied with hot pot experts. There are so many ways to appreciate the food and so many combinations are possible. You indeed have a wide choice of vegetable, noodles, fish or meat balls available but the fountain drinks are way too sweet tho. You should ask for both a spicy and a regular broth but make sure you get lamb - yeah that's you are here for.

Some pieces of meat might be frozen but nothing made me question the hygiene of this place. It was clean but I agree that we may doubt of some the places in this area in general. Friendly service on top of it who might even extend its hours just for a party of two.

However, main con: the AC was UNBEARABLE."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of hot pot. There is nothing more satisfying than throwing ingredients into a flavourful boiling hot broth and watch it cook as you anticipate what it will taste like in your mouth. The concept of AYCE makes it even more exciting for me. However, Montreal's Little Sheep is a let down for this promising idea. 
I am not a very picky eater but I do expect food to be fresh and make me feel safe about eating it. The meats were fresh enough, but on the other hand, the veggies weren't all washed. I suspected dirt on them. Make sure to have the pot boiling before putting anything in, do not eat raw food. 
The seasoning bar was ridiculous... Sesame sauce was diluted with lots of water, I had to add 2 teaspoon of salt and soya sauce to make it taste something. No ingredient was labelled, it was such a struggle to mix the dipping sauce. Someone give me advice on how to differentiate salt/sugar, vinegar/soya sauce without looking weird and tasting them :(. 
Anyways, the make-your-own-food experience is something to try out, and if you're YOLO enough, do give it a try. Taste wise it's not that bad because the broth is still good and tasty. 
Price is high for what you get as of quality of food. 
I'd say service is better than average Chinatown restaurants, orders came quickly at our tables.  
I will not be back before a long time, I would rather try other hotpot locations in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love this place and always go with my stomach empty because I can eat and eat. Great for a cold day. I've never been to another hot pot place so no real comparison but I've been to this specific location about 5 times and have never been disappointed. Great selection of meat and veggies. Make your own sauce for dipping. Not sure what it is with Asians and drinking either prune juice or soy milk but I guess it's to clean your palate while you eat? Good food! 

If you don't like sharing with others then this place probably isn't for you! The pots where your food is boiled/cooked it shared so if you use your chopsticks it's like double dipping. 

Over priced for dinner! Don't drink anything and fill yourself up with liquid."}
{"text":"I have been to over five different locations of the Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, including the headquarter restaurant in Inner Mongolia (China). In Montreal, service is probably the restaurant's biggest weakness. Waiters/waitresses are overworked and don't seem to care much about customer service. The first order typically comes the fastest, so order ALL of what you want from the very beginning. There's no guarantee for the following orders - it might take 15 mins... or 40. If the food hasn't arrived after a while, enquire about it. Last time we went, our second order was simply forgotten, and the waitress shrugged when asked about it. Given the number of times that it happened, I began to suspect that delaying/losing orders is a sneaky way to decrease overall food consumption.

The food itself is consistent, as Little Sheep is a chain store that uses pre-prepared packages for the broth. You can even buy it in Chinese groceries and make hot pot at home! Because all-you-can-eat lamb is so awesome, the non-existent customer service is usually tolerated.

Prices are not cheap, but its definitively filling. I wouldn't recommended this place if there was anything better nearby, but I guess it's ok for sudden hot pot cravings."}
{"text":"There are tons of hotpot places booming across the GTA but most of them are in Scarborough/Markham area but it's nice to have a hotpot resto in the west end. My last mongolian experience was at Little Sheep in the Scarb area for my sister's birthday. It wasn't the greatest so I didn't think I would try it again. But what I really likes about Mongolian Hotpot is that it's a sit down kinda AYCE menu so you get to order from the table. Let's break down the good:

AMBIENCE: this used to be a congee restaurant that I used to go to  but has been completely renovated into a nice spacious restaurant. The restaurant is well ventilated and lit and can accommodate up to 250 patrons. There is lotsa room between the tables. The only thing is that the table space is a little tight if you have a large group they can only accomodate 6 guests and if you each are getting your pot then you may not have room on the table to eat when the food comes.

FOOD: I really like the selection of items that you can choose from such as beef, lamb, pork, chicken, sweet potato, dumplings, noodles, etc. The list goes on and on but my favourite in particular were the handmade noodles they were so fresh and had a nice smooth texture. All the ingredients were made fresh. They also have a sauce station which was poor labeled so you have to figure what sauce is what.

SERVICE: Can't complain for an asian restaurant, it was quick and efficient and even though some of the food items we ordered didn't come, our server still managed to check up on us to make sure that we had everything.

Overall, great experience and I definitely will come back for the next hotpot craving."}
{"text":"I only go here because my mom likes this restaurant, but honestly I think it lacks in quality. I went with my mom and boyfriend 2 weeks ago and the mushrooms had dirt on it. It looked like those mushrooms have never been washed...at all.  Also the cauliflower had black mold on it. It's pretty disgusting. I don't understand why they even decided to put those out there on the rack of \"fresh\" food to put in your hot pot. Did they even bother checking?

I have nothing else to say except to add that the waiters look like they are very unhappy to work there.  I really highly recommend those who want to try (if you really have to)  the hot pot to eat with caution. And for the rest of you who want to just eat hot pot, avoid this restaurant at all costs. They do not take hygiene or safety measures in mind."}
{"text":"Eating here is soo fun & delicious!!! This is a great place to come to with your family & friends. The soup base is yummy & I really enjoyed the selection. Don't judge me but I love getting the fried buns with the condensed milk. I get so much of that every time & my friends judge me for getting the most worthless thing there but it's SO GOOD, best dessert.

The restaurant was nicely renovated & had a great ambiance. It's kind of loud because the restaurant is filled with Chinese people  but that adds to the live vibe. The waiters are helpful & it's just a great time every time I come."}
{"text":"Not the best location for this chain of restaurants. The atmosphere is nice but the food selection wasn't the greatest. There are definitely better hot pot places in the chinatown area toronto"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I really enjoyed it. The restaurant was modern and clean - the nicest hot pot buffet I've been to for sure. I liked that the tabletop burners were built into the tables to be one flat surface. 

The service was great. Food orders came out quick and our drinks were often refilled. A server also comes around with pitchers of soup in case your pot needs a refill.

The soup seasoning is different than I'm used to but still delicious. They offered a wide variety of meat and veggies. You may order as much as you want but you're limited to three rounds so make your orders worthwhile! I personally order a lot at once so we were filled up from two orders. An awesome aspect of this restaurant is that they bring you a folding table when you order too much food to fit on the table (which I'm always guilty of). 

My favourite part of the restaurant was the sauce station where you can create your own dipping sauces. I liked trying out different combinations. By the end of the meal, I was enjoying perfected my sauce. 

All in all, great atmosphere, food, and service. They have some cute servers too which is always a plus :)"}
{"text":"Most food was fresh not frozen which was nice. Like the lamb and the fresh made meat balls. But, reviews were right service sucked. Had to keep asking for dishes that were missing in our order. Ice cream is not ayce, two scoops per person max. Otherwise, you get a lecture about how they aren't suppose to give you more than one order (if you ask for seconds). We had a table of six, so getting in and out wasn't easy to grab sauces and drinks all the time. Cups were too small so my brother kept getting refills for the table cause he sat at the end. Boyfriend asked for a pitcher of water to make it easier, but they refused to give it to us because it was reserved for people who order beer. We all did get our own pot which is nice. I have a food allergy, so it's nice that I didn't have to share the soup with someone else. It does get really hot in the restaurant, as there is no ventilation above the table. There was only two soups available, clear or spicy and we didn't have to pay extra for the fancier soups since it wasn't offered. Also, price on site said it as $19.99 but when we got there the menu said $20.99. Not a big deal, but it was kind of a shady move. Try it for yourself at least once if you're interested. I may go back since I live downtown and there isn't a huge selection of hot pot places around here."}
{"text":"My first time trying hot pot and I loved it!! There was a large group of us on a Friday and we waited about an hour for seats. 
We were a little squished in but it was fairly comfortable. Lots of cool options to create your dip... egg yolk, garlic, oil, soya, etc. 
We ordered many delicious things to cook, I liked the veggies, dumplings, lamb, beef and seafood. 
I would come back here at a less busy time."}
{"text":"They were super busy on a snowy spring day so considering they probably weren't properly staffed on an unexpected busy weeknight our server handled our service very well and the food was pretty good for the quality. 
We try to go on Monday - Thursday for the cheaper price of $19.9o/person with a current promo of free basic soup base which works for me consisting I can't eat spicy."}
{"text":"A pot of broth ranges from $2 for a small clear broth to $5 for the Yin Yang Pot (1/2 clear, 1/2 hot) then $15.99 for AYCE lunch or $21.99 for dinner. Dinner which is available all day offers a wider selection of seafood including squid, shrimp, cuttlefish, mussels and fish fillets as well as other items. Decor is clean and modern, ingredients are fresh and abundant. Dip sauces are on a rolling cart in the middle of the restaurant. Service is spotty and less than intuitive. Depending on which server you draw, your experience will vary from long waits before seeing your server and getting incorrect items or none at all to friendly and passably attentive. Worthwhile if you enjoy a tasty and satisfying DIY meal. Note: they only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"Hotpot? Check! All-you-can-eat? Check! 

I discovered this place several years ago and have been visiting ever since. Gone is the buffet-style, you'll now find the whole restaurant has been renovated and re-designed. You now order each item from a menu that you fill out, and the overall quality of the items has gone up from what I remember. Everything tasted fresh (beef, lamb, shrimp, squid, mussels, vegetables, tofu, fish, sausage, noodles) and was presented quite nicely. What you lose by not being able to pick 1 piece of an item, you gained in quality. You can still self-serve soft drinks and mix up your own dipping sauce. 
There are also desserts available with no charge (ice cream, sesame balls, canned fruit) and some items to buy for an additional charge.
Overall I think this system is an improvement and am already thinking about going back in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good I didn't like how they didn't take credit card."}
{"text":"Always such a good experience eating here. The staff is super attentive and nice. Love the serve yourself wall of fresh foods so you can control your own portions."}
{"text":"Came here a few times, with my boyfriend. I like the idea of getting your own, instead of having them bringing it to you. It's an All You Can Eat hot pot place. The only food that they bring to you is your pot with soup and your main meat (ex; Lamb, beef, pork). You can also get your own sauce, dessert, and drink. I love the lamb! Sometimes, they don't have the same items (food) out. The service is nice, clean and friendly. During peak hours, the place gets really packed, busy, and waiting takes a while. So, going early is a better idea. Yes, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've had hot pot before, thinking there's a Mongolian twist. It's just the soup base and a couple different dishes, but it's extra.

To start, there's the All-You-Can-Eat price ($21.99), but then you have to add more for the soup base ($4). There's boiling water too, but this isn't suggested.

Anyway, there's a choice of your standard meats (regular/garlic chicken, beef and lamb), vegetables (lettuce, mushrooms, tofu, seaweed), noodles and wontons. For the dinner menu, there's a larger variety of seafood items (fish, squid, mussels, shrimp, meatballs).

The homemade pork/beef/fish/shrimp/lamb meatballs are a must try!

There's also a buffet table with drinks (soy milk and prune juice [eww]), as well as make your sauce ... and random food (spring rolls, canned clementines).

Overall, it's a great experience. Servers were attentive and friendly, but their English wasn't the best."}
{"text":"It's great to find a hot pot place in Toronto that's reasonably priced and still top tier quality. Came here for dinner with my boyfriend for the second time and he loved it for his first hot pot experience. Really spacious and clean. All you can drink plum juice, soy milk and water! The make your own sauce station is also a definite plus in my books."}
{"text":"Great place! My favorite hotpot place in toronto! The lamb is a killer here, must try. Serive is great , it can be slow sometimes but youll get what you looking for. I hilghly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great experience: super clean, great selection, fresh food, tasty broth (we had both spicy and regular) and friendly service. My goodness, you can eat as much as you want, going to the buffet to select the foods to boil in your pot. They brought very fresh, thinly sliced meat right away, and I am glad that this is NOT something served buffet style, as I trust sliced meat more when it is fresh from the kitchen.
That said, everything at the buffet was very fresh, and the selections were replaced frequently and promptly. The choices of ingredients included such items as watercress, various greens and broccoli, sausage, pork skin, dumplings, shrimp (those were excellent), fish and meat balls, as well as plenty of tofu, noodles, mushrooms, lily buds (so good in hot pot!) and fungus. It's possible to put yourself into a seriously satisfying food coma.
We went early in the evening (5:30) which I would recommend as it is not too busy or hectic. We had a groupon for 2 worth 20, so our food fest cost a combined total of $35. Excellent value, in my opinion.
The desert selection was not great, but for me, this isn't part of the hotpot experience. The great, refreshing plum drink balanced the savoury hot pot very nicely.
I look forward to returning in the winter, as hot pot can be a bit overwhelming in the summer."}
{"text":"The new format renders averse the proper condition of self serving bliss. The establishment now uses the same instance of most AYCE sushi. The waiters attend the tables as sheet orders are filled. The menu list is abbreviated to vegetables, noodles, and two kind of meats(beef and lamb). Disappointed."}
{"text":"The Restaurant is very well designed And bright inside. It's a great first impression. 

Service was lacking at this place. We went on a Sunday night for dinner for 3 adults. It says 23.99 per person for dinner and you Also have to pay extra $5 for choosing the big shareable pot, circled in my attached photo. 

You get 3 rounds per order cycle. Service was so slow that they didn't even take our sheet for the first round at all, my cousin had to drop it off to the front after waiting 30 minutes.

They gave us the appetizers right away and Water with Lemon( this is used to suppress appetites haha).

Waited another 30 minutes for the first round to be brought to our table. 
After waiting for so long, they didn't even bring us everything. They only brought the beef when we ordered 4 items on the first part. We had ordered lamb, beef, garlic chicken and garlic beef. They never came until after an hour later and re ordering on the second round. 

Nobody checked on us when we needed broth refill, my husband went to the front to ask for broth refill and he was ignored, my cousin went 10 mins later and they finally went and filled the broth 25 mins later.

Service is really slow, might I mention again. 

You have to be really patient if you want to eat here, or speak Chinese. 
I saw the table next to us served with all their meats before we got ours an hour later.

Don't come hungry or you will become \"hangry\" lol

Dip station is my only favourite part for they have a lot of selection. 


Food was okay. 
Service was bad.
Price was okay.

Will I be coming back again? Probably not."}
{"text":"This is a popular franchise restaurant from China ...good price and good food,all you can eat,and the soft drink too....compare with the one in China town..I like hotpot this one in Brossard...the service is good and cheaper than Chinatown ...I like here!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place for our first time! 

There were enough simple options for the hot pot ingredients (we got chicken, spinach, broccoli, potato, beef, daikon, dumplings).

We ordered garlic chicken and garlic beef but the soup was garlicky enough on its own. We should've ordered the regular chicken and beef. 

The chicken broth was very salty but delicious and savoury.

The spicy chicken broth had a very deep spice to it that just hits the back of your throat. It's not a burning spicy, more of a flavourful spicy. Loved it when I mixed in a little more regular chicken broth. Lots of chilli pieces in the broth that kind of got in the way when I was drinking the broth. 

Service was slow. The waiter rarely came to check on us and we had to ask for tea and more buns a couple times in a row. 

I LOVED the sweet buns and seaweed appetizers. Delicious. The pork was so tender and flavourful. 

I would come here again! The price was reasonable at lunch time but I would make sure I come with 5+ people or people who have a big appetite!"}
{"text":"There's an abundance of hot pot restaurants in Chinatown Toronto but I'm a big fan of the Little Sheep chain. This location is basically AYCE because you can go through 3 rounds of food selections and there are other premium selections that are available at an additional cost.

Their broth choices are milky (bone marrow broth) and spicy but you can also do half and half, AKA yin yang style. Beware of the peppercorns in the spicy broth because it's more of the numbing spice feeling! The meat is good quality and the portions are generous. They also have appetizers (ranging from cold noodles, seasoned veggies, etc.) that you can pile up on while you wait for your food to cook. They also have a self-serve create your own sauce bar and offer dessert! Service was also friendly and we were checked up on frequently."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a hot pot place in sauga. Surprised how big this restaurant is.

Service is good, they have a lot of young staff working so they were attentive. 

Quality is good and fresh! Just wished that they would've mentioned that some items were unavailable since we were waiting for it before we reordered. 

They have a sauce station but it wasn't well managed. It looked pretty skimpy and easily contaminated with other sauces. Have to ask the server for eggs if you want it in your sauce."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night and surprisingly I was seated right away even though it was a extremely busy, maybe it had to do with the fact I had 6 people with me. 

I've been here many many times before this and I feel like each time is the same. It's not that great just a place I can go to get a hot pot fix. 

You only have three choices of soup spicy broth, non spicy broth, and ying and yang (half spicy/half non spicy). I usually get the ying and yang because the spicy broth is super spicy I swear they put whole pepper plant in there or something because you're going to be scooping out a lot of peppers at the bottom of the pot.

Meat selection is average, typical hot pot choices. I like the fact that you're able to get up and create your own dipping sauce though! 

Not my go to hot pot place but if I was really craving it and didn't want to head to Richmond Hill/Markham, I'd settle for here."}
{"text":"Okay really? The place says open until 11. But then the waiter tells us (at 9:38) that the kitchen is closing. The restaurant is packed. Is this a joke? We were pretty polite but ouch. Now we're cold and hungry and have to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend and found it mediocre. The cleanliness was not there, they had a station towards the back where you can self serve for the food. They ran out of watercress and enoki mushroom and never refilled. The selection was not that great. I did however liked where you get your own pot and you can choose from spicy or the original soup base or both. There is a surcharge for the combined soup based. As for the meat they had lamb and beef where you have to order from the waiter. I would probably not come back again as there are better places with more variety and more clean."}
{"text":"4 stars food
0 stars service, it was totally abysmal this time.  what up with that?  the girl at the front was a total you know what.  anyway...its a good thing the whole food experience saved the day."}
{"text":"Good place to go on a cold day. The taro, shrimp and multiple fish balls are consistently good there."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the time we went(around 9pm)...  but service was mediocre at best(everyone looked tired) and we never got all the lamb, beef, and pork meats as requested. WTH!!!We didn't over order as some might suspect.  For an automatic 15% tip it was disappointing, even of its AYCE.  Mind you we did have a table of 10, but service shouldn't have diminished.  The meats and veggies were fresh, but I'll take my $30 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for hotpot with the family decided to try this place out since it just opened. Our waiter was really friendly but they are way under staffed. I had to walk to the bar to refill my drinks myself. It took forever for our food to come out. The beef smelt and tasted weird. Sauce station was so small there was a long line up.....by the time I got to it there was no more soya sauce or anything for that matter. All in all it was okay. There's better places to go for hotpot."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:45pm on a Friday night, was told by staff they were closed. The sign at the door says they're open until 11. Looked like a nice place, but if you want to close by 10, just say so."}
{"text":"This is by far my best dining experience in Montreal!  I went there for the first time this summer and I plan to go back!    I had never done hot-pot before so I didn't know what to expect.  The idea:  You have big pot of broth which cooks at your table (table has a hot plate, so no open flame) and you dip things in there to cook them and then pop into your mouth for instant nirvana!

The details:  $25 per table (add $4 for spicy broth), add table fee, add more money for meat.  Total = $50 for my hubby and I and well worth it.

1) Choose broth:  You can get a clear or spicy broth or both (divider in pot keeps them separate.  We got both and I must say the spicy broth is much better.
2) Choose meats (extra):  We got beef and lamb.  Both were thinly sliced and tasted amazing when cooked in the broth.  
 3) Take plate and walk around buffet adding items to cook in the pot.
4) Dip items in hot liquid, blow to cool them off, pop in mouth. Nom, Nom, Nom!

The place was crowded and noisy but I didn't really mind.  The food was that good!  It was just such a wonderful experience to try all the different items from the buffet (mussels, prawn, chinese brocoli, bok choy, bamboo shoot, baby corn as well as the thinly sliced meats).   It was quite a selection!  There is a photo of me that my husband took which makes me look like quite a bad mother! My daughter is lying next to me in the booth, and I am ignoring her and stuffing my face with food.  

I didn't give this place a five-star because well, it isn't \"fine-dining\" but it's good.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try hotpot at a restaurant and the opportunity came along when a friend of mine invited me to eat with her because before that I have only had home made hot pots, like tons and of all sorts. So I was very disappointed at the broths. She took the spicy and I took the non spicy one and neither one was to my satisfaction. Price was $20 all you could eat but when something isn't to your standards then all you can eat doesn't do much for you. The service was horrible. We waited over a half an hour to get anything. No broth no veggies no meat. Nothing.  There were people there who arrived after who got theirs within 10 mins. I was so upset. I ended up grabbing cups and plates from a different table myself. When I asked our waitress why it was taking so long she just said \"okay\" smiled fakely and walked off. I am a very generous tipper but when service is as horrible as that, I do not tip at all. Some people may be ashamed to do that but I'm not and I would like the workers to know that they do not deserve any more than that one visit I gave them."}
{"text":"I found this place OK. I like their service, I think they're efficient however I really dislike the variety and the execution. They have a corner where they have all of the food options for you to pick and choose (buffet style). It was hectic and crowded and everyone was just jammed into this corner. I did not like the tongs touching meat then someone using it to get veggies (hello? contamination?) It would make sense if they organized the fridge shelves to be meat only or veggies only etc. The island table is smack in the middle so that adds to the crowded problem. Their dessert options are disappointing, only had some fried dough with condensed milk...that you do yourself. The website is very misleading, they say they offer sorbet and red bean mochi.....NOPE. I came back to the table and there were plates of meat on it...that's great except we don't know what meat is what. We ended up playing a game called \"Guess what animal this is?\" Lamb? Beef? More waiters dropped off plates of meat that we did not order without telling us what we were getting. There is no system to this madness! Give us paper to mark down what meats we want! What if someone can't eat a certain kind of meat?! The spring rolls were frozen, and the shrimp chips were stale. You go up and get your drinks, they have pop, soya milk?, and lemon tea? (I never tried but I am only guessing from the looks of it). The iced tea from the pop machine is suuuuuper sweet. The workers came by to refill our soup bases. I like their soup bases they have actual chinese herbs in it. NOTE: If you do get the spicy soup be prepared for it to be very spicy, we fished out around 40+ chili peppers. Overall, I had to do all of the work and I still had to tip them. I would have liked to have chosen the meat myself, and I got confused but I believe you are charged extra $ for what kind of pot you want (half pot/2 single pots etc). Come around 5pm to avoid the dinner rush or you will be waiting and watching others eat."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. First, they only take reservations for 6+ people. Second, we arrive to find that there were empty tables waiting for reservation parties plus many 4 people tables were filled with pairs. Third, they forced my group to sit at a table with a shared pot instead of our desire for individual pots.

The tables could be more organized with tables of 2 to maximize the usage of the tables. However, it may mean less room to put dishes. Unlike other hot pot places, you can pick-up your own food with a good variety except you need to order the beef and lamb due to health issues I guess. Although the meal was slightly cheaper than other hop pot places, the quality of the food was lacking plus it was a zoo trying to navigate through the crowds to get your food. They do however have unlimited water-downed drinks including pop, soy milk and plum juice.

I would likely not return again since the service and quality of food was terrible. The website posted that they had scallops but there was none to be found. I recommend to avoid this place until they fix the problems and enhance the experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hotpot in the Toronto area by far. The menu has a wide variety of things to choose from, and there is no time limit (unlike most hotpot places, which are usually 2 hour max). In theory, you can sit here all day eating and they wouldn't mind. 

Make sure to ask for the soft meat, as a lot they bring out is quite rough. Also, the menu ordering system is confusing, but after you fill up the 3 rounds they will get you a new paper to keep ordering if you ask for it. The desserts are also not only 1 round like the menu states, and the mini fried buns are delicious! 

I won't waste my money or time at any other hotpot."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat shabu. Great concept too - pay to cook your own food, get your own drinks, and make your own sauce. They should let us butcher our own animals, would make it a memorable experience. 

Food was good since I cooked it, so good that they are lucky I don't live nearby or I could singlehandedly run them out of business."}
{"text":"i love hotpot but a bit inconvenient to prepare if only making for two people, so this is where i go when i get the cravings.

pretty authentic sauces. lots of items to choose from. but like all buffets like this, not all that clean.... so you boil everything and make sure everything's cooked thru! i wont eat anything raw here.

once it was dissapointing that the softdrink maker didn't work... the other drinks were kinda odd. i missed my coke"}
{"text":"I always love hot pot. This place sliced lamb fresh as you order it. yum!

Over priced considering you are cooking everything yourself. The quality of food and the selection was decent so it works out. definitely can't do this all the time, encourages over-eating because totally delicious."}
{"text":"Waoh, when a friend invited me here, I was not expecting this amount of food lol. Basically you have a hot pot in front of you with an amazing tasting broth where you can cook all sorts of stuff: beef, chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, wontons, fish balls, shrimp (the shrimp! So fresh it almost looked alive), dumplings, noodles etc etc etc, you name it, I can't even remember what we put, we ordered everything, it's all you can eat (or at least the menu option that we ordered). So if you are hungry and want to have a Mongolian hot pot rich in flavors and ingredients, I really recommend this place. They will have the normal broth and the spicy one. I would recommend to get half and half, and probably ask to go easy on the spicy side if you are not used to hot spicy food."}
{"text":"Before I start the review on the food, I will warn you...  Wear old clothes and make sure your shoes have grip if you plan to come!

This AYCE hot pot concept will certainly satisfy your appetite!  There is enough variety for both meat eaters and vegetarians.

You can choose a spicy or mild broth... or a divided pot with both.

Then, you are given plates of raw meat for you to cook in your own individual pot.  If you want seafood or vegetables, there is a corner where you fill up your plate with whatever variety you want. This is also where you make your own sauce to add flavour to your cooked food and grab other things like dessert and drinks.  The All You Can Drink varieties include Pepsi, Orange Soda, Sprite, Brisk Iced Tea, Soy Milk, Plum Juice and Chrysanthemum Tea.

I don't go to hot pot often but the thing with this place in particular is the pungent smell of cumin in their broths. It's also quite a social meal as you can chat while you wait for your food to cook. Since you're there for at least an hour, you and your clothes end up smelling like cumin. In addition, the floors are constantly slippery because of the steam from the broth so you have to be careful when you walk.

I think because 2 days after my meal (and 5 rounds of Febreze), my jacket still has a faint smell of cumin, I don't have a desire to go back. I'm sure I'll get over this in another week.

Almost forgot to add that a pitcher of beer was $6.99!"}
{"text":"Don't go in their in you are not hungry. It wont be worth it because you can get the broth at a chinese grocery store and they sell the lamb at the brossard location or korean grocery stores. Ask for the super super spicy  broth if you are daring :D and my favorite way to eat hot pot is to star with meat (lamb) .After about 2plates of lamb, I start with veggies and frozen tofu (be warned some of their labels have the weirdest translation). That way the veggies and tofu can really suck up the lamb flavor."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good service. Speedy food delivery. The premise itself was very clean and spacious. This is where the positive side of this review ends.

There were three of us and we ordered a split pot with one side being spicy and the other one not. We ordered a variety of ingredients to cook with: fish, meat, vegetables, etc. 

The results turned out to be horrible. The flavor profile was either bland or too strong of some unknown spice. 

We left the restaurant with a sour taste in our mouths that would not disappear for a good 24 hours and I had stomach problems. Maybe I just don't have the right appreciation for Mongolian food but as far as  first impressions iare concerned, I am extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"LOl first bad review of my life boys and girls lets gooooooo.

so tbh i didn't even actually eat here, when my family and i sat down you could already see that there was like only 2 or 3 other groups of people eating here. i was already skeptical, because people have told us about bad reviews, but we thought we would give this place a chance anyways. also because we had a coupon we found online (groupon gang).

so the waiter was actually pretty nice, but right away when we showed him the coupon to check if it was alright, he did not allow us to use it. this is kind of how to convo went

Us: \"ah ah real quick can we see if this coupon is valid here styll\"

Waiter: *sees coupon* \"yo this coupon is like for 4 people dawg, you guys only have 3 people idk if you can use it fam\". 

Us: \"makes no sense tho, it says $X cash value for 4 adults, just because we got 3 peeps does not limit us to use this coupon, it has a certain cash value. we would just pay the difference\"

Waiter: \"nah you need 4 mans to reach and use it here fam.\"

Us: \"Check with your manager pls. this is actually not the way a coupon works you dingus\"

Waiter: \"okee\"

So he showed the manager, and he still didn't let us use it and so we were kinda mad and left. Like it just makes no sense to me that you HAVE to follow what it says, like that's not more important than customer satisfaction. the reason why people give bad reviews here is not only just bad service and food, it's already expensive enough. if you release this coupon to get more customers, then no matter what, the rules don't matter, it's making sure your customers are happy.

not gonna lie lol i really hope this place dies out so i can see what they make here next. im actually so sad that congee dynasty closed down, that place was lit

moral of story: if you own a restaurant, or a business, coupons attract customers. don't turn them into something that can keep them away."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to visit this hotpot place in Mississauga which is only one of two hotpot places in the area. They usually have Groupon deals if you are coming with a group of people. When we arrived at the hotpot place, it wasn't too busy and were able to get a table right away for 4 people at around 7PM on a Friday evening. How it works at this hotpot place is that they give you an extensive menu of meats, seafood, veggies and other dishes to choose from in 3 different rounds. If you aren't sure about a particular item, they have menus with pictures to help guide you. We came out of the gate running and ordered a bunch of items in the 1st round that are our table filled up and that we had an extra table for our veggies. You have to pay extra to choose your hotpot broth and I chose the spicy one. You can also chose whether you want individual pots or communal pots to share with. There are sauce stations throughout the restaurant where you can customized and make your own sauce. It wasn't too long before they got our food out. They also gave us complimentary appetizers on the house which was a nice way to start our meal. My favorite dishes were definitely the garlic beef and chicken. Simply amazing and quite flavorful that I ordered a few more orders of these and literally kept stuffing my face. We ordered a variety of meats, seafood, veggies and noodle dishes. Their menu is quite extensive and so much to choose from. After 2 rounds, we decided to call it quits and order the dessert. They only have green tea and red bean ice cream for dessert. The staff are overtly friendly here and were always willing to help us and made sure everything was okay with our hotpot experience. It was definitely one of the better hotpot experiences that I've had and a great Groupon deal to use here. I would highly recommend this hotpot restaurant and would return again knowing that I will have a great experience dining here. It's definitely 5 stars for me on this one."}

{"text":"I went there with my parents on a Wednesday evening around 8pm. We used a Groupon deal of $12 for a value of $20. The place was 65-70% full and we still had to wait for 10mins because there was no table for 3 with individual pot. 

Two of us got the mild broth and the other got the half and half. To start, my dad and I didn't like the taste of it. It has a hint of curry and not as flavourful as other places I've tried and there were many chinese herbal ingredients which I'm not a fan of. 

As per other Yelpers' review, the food is indeed not very sanitary as not all their foods come with a selected tong, so people use the same tong for different kinds of veggies or meats. On the other hand, I like the open buffet concept where you can see, choose whatever you want, and take your quantity.

On the downside is the service. They do refill your broth when they see that it's decreasing, but they do not refill/replace empty trays with fresh ones. My dad wanted to get another serve of beef balls, but it was empty. He went again after 20mins and still empty. This is not the only food that we couldn't eat because of this problem. Around 9.30pm, I went to their dessert station to look what desserts they have, and again, it was all empty. I thought maybe they took out the trays to get fresh ones. 

Be careful with the time you go there. Their official closing time is 11pm, but last call is at 9.55pm. I asked for the desserts that I didn't see earlier and was told that sorry, it's too late. As of 10pm they're starting to take back all the foods and started cleaning. They only left the drinks there until 10.30pm. 

Will I ever come back? I don't think so. 

Food: 2.5/5
Service: 2/5
Cleanliness: 2/5"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the hot pot experience when I went to Little Sheep (2 times)

You can get half regular/half spicy broth (+$4 to your bill) - Personally I find that the regular broth is lacking flavor, so I will take just spicy next time!

You pile your plate high with veggies and seafood and tofu at a buffet style counter/wall and the servers bring you slices of beef and lamb. Sometimes, your meat will come in frozen, but that's ok, it's still good.

I only ever eat the veggies, because I am not super adventurous and am worried about the seafood, but I am sure its excellent! I enjoy the little bite sized things they have on the buffet too (spring rolls, asian donut-type bread - DELICIOUS, some kind of samosa looking thing, onion rings, etc.

You serve yourself (servers come to bring more meat, add broth to your hot pot and troubleshoot any induction hot plate issues that may occur) So expect to get up for water and food often.

The price is a little on the expensive side in my opinion, especially for dinner (which has the same choices as the lunch menu) but it is a buffet and quite unique, so once in a while is ok (about $50 for 2 - dinner buffet)

This is a little gem in China Town and I recommend going with anyone from your significant other to an entire group, this type of dining allows for conversation and is interactive, fun."}
{"text":"There was always a gaping hole for hot pot in Mississauga's food scene. Having been to Little Sheep twice now since it opened two months ago, I can confidently say that that hole still exists to some extent. 

My most recent visit to Little Sheep was for my mom's birthday. We had a group of 14 people coming in, most of whom had never tried hot pot before and were looking forward to a new experience. I explained the concept to them and they seemed very excited. 

Our server was very genuine and likable in the way she accommodated our group. We were promptly seated and she explained the process to us. Unfortunately, though her tone was nice, I couldn't help but feel like she was detailing a big cash grab to us. 

So the lunch price is $15.99, but this only includes vegetables + sliced beef/lamb/pork. It's pretty much a no-brainer to upgrade to the dinner price of $22.99 (more types/cuts of meat, seafood), but add an extra $1.00 on weekends. That's the base price. On top of that, you have to pay for each pot of soup you want (with free refills). Some tables have individual boilers ($2-$2.50/pot) and some tables have communal boilers ($4-5/pot). Water is included but tea is an extra $1/pot per table. Drinks are not bottomless, but instead are $1.50/can. Sum it all up, and you're looking at nearly $35/person after tax and auto-grat. Much nicer meals can be had for this price.

But moving on to the actual experience... 

You can create your own bowl of sauce to enjoy your food with. There is a sauce bar conveniently located in every room of the restaurant where you can mix and match different sauces. My personal favourite is the barbecue base with some sesame sauce and a dash of chili oil.

There are two soup bases for you to choose from - mild and spicy. If you want half and half, you need to order the large pot at $5. These soup bases are refillable. I personally find the mild one to be pretty bland and love the spicy one. It's a shame they don't have more soup bases like other places, but I can live with these two offerings.

There is a big laminated menu with pictures detailing each of the AYCE items. You make your actual order, however, on a sheet of paper. It's the same sheet as you'd get at an AYCE sushi joint where you just input the quantity you'd like beside the menu item. I found that the laminated menu doesn't match up with the paper menu, as there are some items that are missing on one menu and vice-versa. We made our first order (heavy on the meat and seafood) and gave it to our waiter for processing.

Our vegetables were pretty quick to arrive, so we started by cooking those. Nothing to complain about on that front. However, our seafood and meat took a long time to come. I've come to expect from AYCE places that the meat/seafood typically comes after a long delay, but we had to ask for our order a couple times before it actually arrived. By the time our meat came, we were already full from eating everything else. I can't help but assume that this is what the restaurant wanted. 

For dessert, they have the usual assortment of ice cream. They also have mini-buns which are baked and served with condensed milk. These were really good.

Overall, the act of cooking your own food was the best part of the meal. I've had far higher quality hot pot experiences in the past - entire orders coming in a decent amount of time, higher quality meats, etc. However, Little Sheep still fills in a hole in Mississauga's food landscape, albeit for the time being. If a higher quality restaurant comes in the near future, I can see it easily taking Little Sheep's customers. 

BTW: This place doesn't have forks! (???) I understand that it's an Asian establishment and chopsticks are the norm, but not everyone is adept at using them and would prefer to use a fork. I actually knew this ahead of time and brought a few forks from home to address this. (When we asked for forks for the table, they said that all of their forks were currently in use, and they don't know when they'll have some available. I was in disbelief just hearing this in a restaurant in Mississauga)."}
{"text":"Usually I go there with my friends. It's in the Chinatown. The place is clean, price isn't expensive comparing to its competitors."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6:30 on a saturday. We got there and there was a huge line up. Considering i made a reservation i was assuming we will be seated on a decent period of time. We waited an hour to be seated! With a toddler hungry and crying. waiter just keep passing our table, not even offering a drink. After another 20 minutes Finally took out order slip. Food took so long to be served. ( it was busy,so i get that) food was great but the hassle its not even worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Morals hotpot right across the street but we've been limiting ourselves to maximum once a month due to the cost of morals ($80 for two on weeknight sand $85 for two on weekends). We were craving hot pot the past weekend and since we've already had our monthly dose of morals, we decided to try little sheep. 

We've had little sheep many times already when back in Montreal but from the reviews on yelp, I saw that the one in Toronto offers more variety and therefore was curious to give it a try. 

Overall, the quality and choices were not bad and the price was also quite decent ($55 for two for dinner). Ingredients quality nor variety was not as good as morals hotpot but justifiable by the cost."}
{"text":"Best Hotpot place in Calgary. Their soup is way better than the other restaurants, like One pot, here lots of ingredients inside, adding rich flavour. The meat is so fresh. The thickness is just so right that it melts in the very hot soup. Of course you can always use the sauce bar to get the most of it.

Service by today is attentive. Server explained the menu to us, and refill our soup and drinks a couple times. 

We were given $5 coupons at the end of the meal. Was an pleasant experience! Will come back again!

Downside: too busy during the weekend, had to wait 20 mins for the table."}
{"text":"Meats are fresh. The self selection is limited, most composed of fish balls and veggies. Meats will have to be asked for from the table only. 

I liked how customers could make their own sauces. 
You can customize how spicy your dipping sauces can be. 

The pop/soda is watered down. 

Place is clean and very tidy. Plenty of staff, service was quick pronto. 

Will return again. Come before 6:30pm this place gets packed real quick."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! There are plenty of options for those who like spicy or not, lots of meat and vegetable options and there is a dessert table too. Only reason I do not give it a 5 star rating is because of the lack of service. It took almost 20 minutes after my party was seated before a server came to us and it took another 40 minutes for our items to come out. It was during the week and there were approximately only 6 other tables in the restaurant that were occupied. If you wish to visit this place, be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"Never had such horrible service.  Complained to the manager and he kept pushing his plum juice for the poor service that we received.  And it was the worst plum juice I've ever had....will not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a weeknight at around 6. We made reservations but it wasn't busy at all when we arrived.

You order on a sheet of paper here and you are limited to ordering 3 times so choose wisely. The ingredients here taste fresh and delicious however the portions for some of their items were tiny (order a lot more of what you think you'd need for beef and fish balls). They also regularly forgot items we ordered. The worst is that they did not give us more beef and lamb even though we tried to order it twice after we finished our initial plate. We thought they only gave one plate which is why we didn't say anything but apparently that's not the case. So if they forget your beef ask for it.

The choices at the sauce station is extensive and they even have a drink fountain with 3 options (gotta love soya milk).

It was disappointing that we didn't get all our orders but nonetheless we had a good time and the food was good. Next time I'll make sure they don't skimp out on the beef and lamb."}
{"text":"We were a party of 9 on a stormy winter night. They were very short on servers. They didn't tend to us at all, and we had to go find them all the time. Fortunately, we had a chinese speaker in the group, which made it slightly better. The food was good, but the service was definitely not good."}
{"text":"Pricey for hot pot but great service for a Chinese restaurant.  It gets very busy on a Friday night so I'd recommend you go early. It can also get quite warm so dress accordingly. Selection of ingredients was great for me; noodles = awesome, dumplings/wontons = meh, greens and veggies = awesome. Would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"All you can eat hot pot for the Canada Goose jacket wearing crowd. Super efficient staff that help you navigate ordering and soup bases. Be careful of the spicy soup, soooooo spicy had to take most of peppers out."}
{"text":"It's SUPER stuffy inside, feels like a tropical rain forest. I don't think they have proper ventilation. The food + quality is below average.. If you're really hungry, love hot pot, and don't mind being a bit unsanitary, I guess it's alright."}
{"text":"My first shot at trying hot pot. Was a bit disappointed. It's a buffet and they have a big selection but found cooking the food in the same broth made everything taste the same.  It was really good at first but after awhile got sick of it.  Was a cool experience but not for me."}
{"text":"Four stars for the good taste. Not that authentic as the one in mainland China, but it is still a good choice for a hot pot in Canada.

One star for the very bad service. What's with the waitress? She talked in a very rude way and even yelled at us!!"}
{"text":"The soup base is this place's specialty. There are many hotpot restaurants in Toronto. This one is known for the soup. In fact, Little Sheep brand is the dominant hotpot mix available from supermarkets as well.

If you're new to hotpot, try getting spicy and non-spicy mix bowl. I like the meats in the spicy section and the veggies in the non-spicy section.

Service is typical. I'm giving 5 stars on food taste alone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one reason why the hot pot restaurants in the Toronto area are so much better than the hot pot restaurants in Boston. This restaurant was suggested to my family by my uncle who lives in Markham, and my cousins like to go here. The last time I went, I left the restaurant extremely happy because I was so full and I found the food to be tasty. What I also really loved about this place was the huge variety they had to offer, giving me a lot of flexibility to create my own tasty hot pot soup compared to some of the other hot pot places I have been to. Ever since I went to this hot pot restaurant, my standards for hot pot have gotten higher, and after going to many hot pot restaurants in Boston, I left usually disappointed.

From what can recall, I went for an all you can eat buffet special that they were offering one night. I had so much beef and lamb, and overall, I found every beef and lamb meat to be deliciously tasty and flavourful. I also had a lot of beef and fish balls, and I also thought they were some of the tastiest I had in Toronto so far. 

I recall that they have a huge variety of noodles, ranging from thin Vermicelli noodles to thick Udon noodles. I liked the Shanghai style noodles the most. I remember having at least three different noodles in my broth, and they were all tasty. The vegetables, such as the tofu and cabbage were fresh, and were also tasty with the nice and hot broth. 

As for the interior, when you sit down, you actually get your own electronic flat top stove that cooks the broth for you, and I liked the fact that it was actually the table surface. I thought the place was spacious and comfortable and the restaurant staff was pretty friendly.

I heard that this place has a few locations in California, so the next time I go to Northern California, I'll keep this place in mind. Overall, I thought I had the best hot pot dinner in the Toronto area so far and ever since I ate dinner at that place, I now have really high expectations for hot pot restaurants. This is not a bad choice if you want something really tasty to eat and to escape from the somewhat terrible Toronto winters at the same time."}
{"text":"Still searching for a stellar hot pot in Toronto and the search continues!

Note: This is my second visit to Little Sheep Hot Pot over the span of two years and my impression has been largely unchanged. 

The good: place is clean and service is prompt/quick/attentive (which could be tricky among other hot pot places I've been in GTA), quality of lamb and beef specifically never disappoint, the broth is also well flavored and tasty, price point is competitive/reasonable

The bad: quality of other ingredients - especially the meat balls and other frozen meals are just OK in terms of quality and selection. Especially the beef ball taste so grainy that even after you cooked it still looks textured, no fish/shrimp ball?. 

Bottom line: Little Sheep pass the taste test and if you simply look at the meat quality and the place cleanliness then you would be more than happy. However if you're looking for a ranged of other dishes (meat ball, dumpling, etc) then you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hot pot... Finally in sauga!! 
I came here on the 3rd day of opening and generally the food and service is decent. You cannot expect 100% when it is new and also so big.  The size is quite nice and the interior is well decorated.  Bright and the light fixtures adds a lot of character.  
At this location,  the only thing you need to stand and get your own is the sauce. The sauce and toppings are on a trolley and imo they need to situate this in a corner and not in the middle of a walkway.  They have everything though except for eggs.. You can't have great hot pot without the egg lol!
The one in Scarborough,  you have to get the food items yourself which I liked a little more,  but getting served at this location is not bad either.  Drinks are extra and you also have to pay for the soup even if you choose the clear soup.  
When we ordered the soup base and the food,  they came pretty quickly.  The soup took a while to boil though and the clear soup base is also quite salty.  The beef and lamb slices is quite good and fresh.  The fish,  beef,  shrimp and lamb balls are freshly made in house which were quite delicious.  Also try their in house made noodles... Sooo good! 
One thing to mention is that we had ordered a second round of beef and lamb but it didn't seem like it would come. Finally the server realized and apologized, which made up for the lack of service. 

They also have a few cooked items on their order sheet.. Northern China items- looks good and will give it a try next time."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone is hating on this place! 

My friend took me here the other day, and I must say I absolutely loved it! 

Service was fast! Almost too fast! Our server was so pleasant and went out of his way to make sure I had a great first experience, even bringing us an assortment of appetizers that we didn't request. The soup was delicious and I left so full and happy. 

Love that they have an assortment of sauces you can add yourself, and the smell of the entire place was divine! I have no complaints here. 

I highly recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Demoting to a two star - service is inattentive and rude. Saw one waiter ask why the man of a couple wasn't paying for this female companion. Had to get up more than ten times to get water, place an order, ask them to refill the broth. Then I leave them a small tip to reflect this and the waiter demanded I leave them more. Smh. If you wanted a higher tip you probably should have been a better waiter. 




Original review: 

Pretty good hot pot. 

Wish they would have better sides though and a better system to get sauces."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 15 at 7pm and lucky we had reservations! There was a line up outside the door. The service wasnt amazing since all the servers were running around and it was difficult to settle down and get my hotpot running and ready to go.

How it works is that you get your hotpot (single broth or double) and you go to the buffet area with a plate and grab any food you want. The selection was pretty good and I loaded up every time I went to get food. The only problem I had was that the food area is small and therefore crowded with people trying to get their food. They also have different sauces and herbs/onions that you can get and mix together in a small bowl. I didn't try any of the desserts since I stuffed myself with beef, but they seemed like the typical pastries you could buy in the supermarket. There's also a pop machine for fountain drinks and also soymilk and a plum drink (an acquired taste). I didn't really like the soy milk as it was grainy and too sweet for my likings. 

Overall, once settled down, I had a great meal and a fun time with my friends. The pricing is average ($28 with tip) but I would like to come again! 

Tl;Dr confusing at first, but you'll get the hang of it. G okay service, good food, average pricing for AYCE"}
{"text":"I walked in and I already knew my clothes were going to smell like boiled beef.

It was my first experience and i asked the waiter to give me the break down and he was like. \"normal, mild or spicy\" and had a really bad up sell with the liquor menu. He said pop was free but I couldn't find ice anywhere.

I went to a fridge where there was all these kind of things I never knew you could throw in a soup.  I\"m used to just chicken noodle but they had every ball you can imagine.  lobster balls, fish balls, lamb balls, beef balls, I decided to make a hot balls soup.

It was fun at first trying to catch all the balls while they were bubbling but then I kept catching the hot peppers that my spicy soup was filled with - It was kinda annoying.

As I walked out, I took a sniff of my clothes and not to my surprise I smelt like sweaty balls."}
{"text":"Given the facts that Montréal's Chinatown eateries are mostly disappointing and that this place was recommended to me by my Chinese friends (like, people who were actually born and raised in China, unlike me), there's not much I can do to complain about this place. Yeah, it's definitely not as good as gourmet hotpot chain restaurants in China like HaiDiLao or those that give you your own personal pots that are super cute, but for an AYCE place, the quality is actually somewhat there. My friends and I come here pretty often when we want to stuff our stomachs until we can't walk, and every time has been pretty consistent.

We always get a half spicy/half non-spicy broth combination. The spicy broth isn't actually spicy at all for my taste, which is slightly disappointing (especially since I grew up with hotpot using only extremely spicy broth), but then again I've found that to be a recurring problem in most Montréal Chinese restaurants anyway (which will be discussed in later reviews). Then, we stock up on a bunch of meat selections - lots of lamb (my favorite!) and beef slices, beef meatballs, fish balls and fish tofu, and garlic beef are only some of them! We also get different varieties of vegetables and soy-based products, such as regular mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, winter melon, leafy greens, and fresh tofu. Of course, rice cakes and fresh handmade noodles are also in order and really soak up all of the broth really nicely. The only other thing foodwise that I have to mention is that the snack bar can be pretty inconsistent regarding freshness - the cream puffs and palmiers can get pretty soggy or stale, but normally the matuan (sesame balls stuffed with lotus paste) and spring rolls are hot and chewy/crispy! In addition, the sauce selection is actually quite good, and you can make your own combinations into which you can dip your cooked food.

Since my friend group and I are basically regulars at Little Sheep, we will be back again. It's definitely one of the better restaurants in a mostly mediocre Chinatown."}
{"text":"For our finale meal in Montreal, we went for an AYCE (All-You-Can-Eat) spot. I've been to the New York location which charges per order, and it's one of the best hot pot places I've been to. Now this place let's you order as much as you want to cook, it was game on. I usually go with the combo soup base (spicy for meats and herbs for veggies). I love going to hot pot for the DIY experience. You get a paper menu and pencil, then write in as many plates of food you can eat. We love the beef, lamb, fishballs, tofu and all the veggies. Leave super content and warm."}
{"text":"Gets pretty busy but its probably the best hotpot place in Toronto within the ~$30 price range. Different people have commented on the quality of the meats and food overall but it's pretty good in my opinion. Wide selection and decently fast service. It does leave a smell on you, so maybe don't wear stuff too fancy or take your first date here :)"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place.  The food (what I was able to get) was fresh and the choice of broths were extensive.  Also really liked the concept of their self serve stations where you could get all the items you want for your hot pot, all the pop/soy milk/plum tea/chrysanthemum tea you want and  the self-serve sauce bar.  

However, that's where the love affair ends.  I deducted stars for this place because they didn't replenish the food in the self-serve stations.  We got seated at 8pm and by then a lot of the items were empty and never got replenished.  They also ran out of soy milk, plum tea and chrysanthemum tea by 8:30 and it never got refilled.  The restaurant doesn't close until 11pm, so having the stations empty at 8:30 that is rather unacceptable!!!

Further star deductions were due to the messy dining space and self-serve stations. Dinners would drop veggies and meat onto the floor and into the other food trays (I can understand that because it's so busy there) but I can't accept that the staff don't clean it up.  The floor was littered with food scraps and dripping wet.  That can't be safe and hygienic. 

I will give this place another shot in hopes that this was a one time misstep."}
{"text":"Business meeting agenda published by my colleagues: 

1. Visit office A 
2. Meet with Retailer B 
3. Hot Pot 
4. Visit Distribution Center 
5. Go to the hotel 

Using my extensive knowledge gained by watching Sesame Street, I figured out what was not like the others on my agenda - Hot Pot! 
I'd never heard of this concept, so many things raced through my mind. 
Maybe drugs? - nope, not with those work people : (

I finally had to ask, and my colleagues replied its a soup place. So, why is this on my agenda? Could it really be that good to plan our meetings around it? I can now say YES! 

The decor of the restaurant is much like many of the Chinese restaurants you find in the States. After taking some time looking at the menu I think I had figured things out. Basically this is Mongolian BBQ, except its soup. Sounds kind of boring, but it wasn't. First off for some ridiculous price of about $8 you get two servings of meat and all the soup and sides (noodles, vegetables, tofu, etc) to put in the soup. The soup and sides are all-u-can-eat. 

The meat and sides were all good, however it is all about the crazy hot soup base, and the concoction of sauces you can make to add to your soup. Since my colleagues were veterans of this process they told me to get the soup bowl that is split in two. One side had the spicy soup the other was a regular broth. They also helped me create a tasty combination of sauces to add to the soup. 

Did I happen to mention that all of this cooking is happening right in front of you at your table? Between all the steam and spice I worked up a nice sweat which helps keep you warm on those cold days in Canada, eh! 

After stuffing myself, like I usually do when someone challenges me to eat all I can, I headed for the bathroom. No, for once its not what you think. I went to to try to get off the multiple oily soup stains off my shirt. Watch out for those rogue noodles!!! Its a b* to get those stains out, but well worth it. 


Next month's agenda: 
1. Blah Blah 
2. Blah 
3. Hot Pot 
4. Blah Blah 
5. Blah 

I now get it!"}
{"text":"What a nice gem in the heart of Scarborough.  This restaurant is HUGE inside!  It doesn't look like it from the outside but wow.

You pick your individual soup base first (regular, spicy, or half and half), order your meats (lambs, beef, pork...) and then take your plate to the back and pick your hot pot options - they have so many things to choose - several types of noodles, fish balls, lobster balls, veggies (bok choy, few different mushroom options, shrimp, tofu, fish, ) and then you can mix up your own sauce combination.   The drinks (fountain drinks) are also located in the back and they have a nice plum drink that hits the spot.

With tax it comes up to about $26 (depending on your soup base).  considering you can just keep re-filling your pot, this is a great deal.

As others have mentioned - it will make your hair/clothes smell so maybe leave your jacket in the car if you can,"}
{"text":"The food was great but service wise this place would've been a 2 star. First off the place wasn't even busy there were so many empty seats yet it took us almost 10 minutes to be seated. The place was clearly understaffed. Also tried to get my water refilled several times but it didn't happen. I told them several times but they seem to forget. And the cup for water seemed to be a mini flower vase. I think there was about 5ml pf water that actually was in there. One sip and it's all gone. 

The hot pot itself was delicious though. We used a Groupon so we got a better deal too. Basically this place is all you can eat hotpot. You can order multiple rounds so don't worry. The meat was very fresh and thinly cut."}
{"text":"The best hot pot place dt.  Awesome broth and hand made beef/shrimp balls.  It's all about the sea food though cuttle fish, fish fillet, shrimp,  tentacles... awesome.  They have complimentary  plum juice , lemon water, and soy milk. The only downside of this place is just you will end up smelling like the place after spending 2 hours inside.  That might turn people off but hey it's your decision  lol.  For me I'd make sure I have no plans and  I'm going straight home after ."}
{"text":"Based on the Morale Village, this place is the other Chinese famous chained hot pot restaurant. 

We came here for lunch. The price here is a lot attractive compared to the other one. The quality of the lamb and the beef meat were very fresh. Even though the lunch menu is a lot limited than the dinner one, the selections are still adequate to meet our demand in terms of the wide variety of vegetables and all kinds of tofu products. 

The price for the soup base is reasonable. We ordered Yin Yang Pot, so I enjoyed the clear pot without the spice and my partner met her needs for the spicy dipping.

I have to highlight the customer service at this place. I was impressed by how often these servers came to take away the empty plates and refilled the empty glass for us. They also came to inquire if we would like to order more food and provided extra napkins for the cleaning needs. 

I had come to this place a few times in the past. The service quality is fairly consistent."}
{"text":"Food is great (so I've heard), if you can get somebody to seat you!  My friend and I went in and waited for somebody (anybody!) to greet us and offer to sit us down.  We waited and waited.  People behind us got fed up and left.  We tried to flag one of the busy servers as they passed by us, but was ignored.  Awful! How does a business expect to stay in business by ignoring its customers? After 10 minutes of being felt like we were invisible, we left as well.  We headed to the Swiss Chalet across the plaza where we were warmly greeted and seated.  The people who were behind us and left were there too!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this restaurant.  Excellent food and service from very friendly waiters and waitresses.  We had a groupon coupon for $40 off, so we were asked to go to the front cashier to pay.  Unfortunately, this is where you need to be careful.  The cashier tried to rip us off by charging us an extra person.  Make sure you double check your bill before paying, if have a large group dining."}
{"text":"Only 2 selection on the stock. The spicy one was very flavourful. The meet selection average. Service was average. But the place was very slippery. I also flipped a few times walking"}
{"text":"Great service; but if you're using the Groupon beware.

Groupon only takes of $40 of the entire meal for 4 people; leaving you to pay +$60 for the meal."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4 on a Sunday and the lunch costs $15.99 (3 round of orders) + $1 for a pot of non-spicy soup. 

It was super busy (waited about 10 mins per order) and the order did not come accordingly. 
Example 1: We ordered beef platter and it did not come after our 3rd round so we had to manually tell the waiter. 
Example 2: Luncheon meat comes in 3 pieces per order. My friend ordered 3 so 9 pieces but only 4 pieces came. 
Example 3: I ordered watercress the first round and it did not come. I ordered again the second round, again didn't come. So I manually told the waiter and some vege came but it's not watercress. 
And there were some minor error here and there but these 3 examples got me pretty annoyed. 

I would personally stick with the lamb or beef, not the garlic chicken and garlic beef because they were so salty! It made soup super salty and I had to add water to it. 

So yeah, overall it was okay - they should prolly hire more waiters because this wasn't my first bad experience with them."}
{"text":"I came here with my family because we had always wanted to try Little Sheep after seeing the chain in New York. I saw it featured on Groupon ($40 for $24) and so on a Friday we had a family date night. 

Food: Great! You have a choice of regular or spicy broth and we all chose regular. The broth has enough flavour without it being overpowering or bland. There's enough choice to satisfy all tastes. My personal fave includes quail eggs and sliced beef and pork. I don't fully remember the differences but for the dinner menu you can get seafood like shrimp or specialties like pork blood. Each order comes with a good amount but of course you can always order more. All the food was pretty good when cooked in the broth. You also have your choice of dipping sauces but we concluded that they weren't really necessary. I also wanted to point out that it comes with basic apps like pickled veggies and that you can also order noodles. 

Service: When we arrived they were attentive and gave us the paper to order and took our drink orders. After that our waiter disappeared however we were able to give our paper to another individual and our food arrived almost immediately. We didn't quite have a waiter so we ended up getting service from various individuals which wasn't a big deal. 

Overall experience: Great! When asked, we went with a table for four where we each had our own pot. This worked out because we each had different tastes. There's also an option where you can share big pots amongst the group. My family will definitely be back to have this again. It's perfect for cold winter nights!

Friday night, adult: $22 (+$2 for soup base) per person"}
{"text":"This is the same Little Sheep Hot Pot that has spread across China becoming the Chinese equivalent to say Olive Garden or maybe comparing it to Sizzler's is more accurate. Even though this is the same restaurant, it's been \"localized\" for better or worse. 

To begin with, it's buffet style. Grab your plate and walk up to the front and pile on the food.  Seafood only makes an appearance for dinner, which is why the evening price is quite a bit more. The front has a section of fountain drinks to choose from and a variety of pre-cooked snacks. The pre-cooked stuff is OK when fresh, but mediocre to bad once the egg rolls, onion rings and other items get cold.

The selection of vegetables is acceptable, but again this is where the \"localization\" impacts things. The veggies and mushrooms are all very safe, nothing is too exotic and this can of course be extended to the meats and seafood which all remain very acceptable to western palettes. 

This is probably the best hot pot restaurant in Montreal but is pretty mediocre as far as \"authentic\" hot pot is concerned. During my last visit some of the seafood was called into question and we were getting a pretty awful stench from an unidentified location. I'll go back for sure and I'll even recommend it to others, but remember you are dealing with raw meat and seafood and vegetables in a buffet environment so be on-guard for any suspect food."}
{"text":"Get your act together! Seriously! You just opened up and already orders are getting messed up or not arriving at all. Even basic things like water had to be requested at least 3 times before it finally arrived. I understand it's busy. Maybe there isn't enough staff (though it certainly didn't look that way), but ordering several items and receiving half of your order (the other half just won't make it, trust me) is just unacceptable.

To add to the service disaster, after paying for the bill, the change from the wrong table came to me. Another 5 mins and my correct change never arrived leaving me to have to get up and argue with one of the staff behind the counter who claimed I only paid x amount, which was incorrect. The matter was eventually resolved but leaves me to ask, if you can't even count up cash properly, don't you think it might be a good idea to accept credit and debit?

The positive is that the food was pretty good as you might expect. Whether it's worth the 45 minute - 1 hour wait if you happen to arrive on the weekend is questionable, but to each their own. Food quality would probably bring this review up to 2.5 star (except that isn't an option). 

Needless to say, I shall not be returning to this location and do not recommend it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend reserved a table for Chinese New Year. When we arrived they didn't have us on their reservation. They did manage to set us up with a table after one hour waiting. Then we had to wait 45 minutes before we got served. After ordering we had to wait one hour before getting our food. Oh they so don't deserve a tip but the waiter had the nerve to tell us we didn't tip!!!! Very bad service, no smiles and if the workers hate their job so much then don't work there. No wonder they advertise in groupon so much."}
{"text":"The most ridiculous place I've seen. So the price for one person is $23.99 for all you can eat. It seems ridiculous because the price doesn't count the broth price. Mm so all you can eat price  is $24 for the raw meat, uncook veggie and pop BUT I have to pay extra $2.5 for the clear broth? How can you eat hot pot with out the broth? Mm misleading price. I can't deal with this. Just a shady business. don't mind about the price, I don't agree how people think this is okay when they are not clarify their products or service with customers."}
{"text":"The soup it's yummy, the spicy soup make a numb feeling to your tongue, the selections is good, but the service it's very slow... It's better to seat in the middle of the restaurant where all the waitress walk around a lot.. Otherwise you have to call them a lot to get their attention. My suggestion you have to be really patient if you want to eat here.."}
{"text":"Great AYCE hotpot in downtown Toronto. Lots of selection and the waiters are nice. From the selection of meats, really only the plain raw meats are good - don't waste your time with the garlic marinaded meats (they're tough). A ton of veggies to choose from (for your daily dose of fibre!), and a bunch of side dishes to choose from (the little mandarins are delicious and so refreshing in light of the 5 pounds of meats you'll consume). Traditional Chinese drinks, like soy milk and plum juice, yum!"}
{"text":"This is my first Hot Pot experience that I have tried in Montreal. 

First rule of Hot Pot:
- Wear clothes that don't matter, or that you can burn after, especially if you \"chill\" at hot pot.
Second Rule of Hot Pot:
- Biting into a whole clove of Anise when you aren't expecting it, is horrifying and leaves your mouth numb, and could potentially cause face wrinkles from the face that you make.
Third Rule of Hot Pot:
- Bring friends, because the more the merrier

So knowing that, basically if you like putting food in hot soup and then eating it, this is both entertaining and fun. Drinks are unlimited in refills, as is food. I don't really get the onion rings in the front, with the triangular samosas... but sometimes when you are in Montreal, you try to look past that, and pretend its not there.

Things to do after hot pot: host a clothing burning bonfire."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, they only had beef or lamb as meat options. In yesterdays visit, there were more options to pick from in the refrigerated section, luncheon meat, sliced pork, sui mai and lobster balls (don't remember seeing those last time). The food selection was good and the soup broth was the same as before (contains msg - makes you thirsty afterwards). 
The servers were very hard to flag down this time. The place was at 85% capacity and the servers were running all over the place. It took awhile to get our soup, we had to order it a second time from a different server who went straight the the kitchen to get it and brought it out. Not sure what happened to the first order. This being the first time I've experienced the mediocre service, I won't go so far as to say it's typical but we'll have to see about that in future visits.

Tip - leave your coat/scarf/mitts in the car - it will absorb the hot pot smell and you won't be able to get it out easily."}
{"text":"much has been said already about this joint.  i just got a few more things to add.

veggies are fresh.  washrooms are clean.  service is not too bad at all.  for an all you can eat type of place there was only one sweet dessert and shrimp crackers!!!  my daughter who came with us ate only a little bit of food and so when we got the check, the waiter asked us if she ate anything, we said no, not that much and so we did not have to pay for her.  this was a nice touch i think.  the soup base was very good, full of herbal ingredients that is good for the heat that you are ingesting because you are eating hot pot type of foods.  

DO  NOT go to this place if you wear nice clothing!  your hair and clothes will be smothered with this spicy smell that is all over this joint."}
{"text":"Unreal. Cheaper than most hot pots and it's so damn tasty. Can't recommend enough. I come here weekly and I'm not ashamed."}
{"text":"Although this was one of the many times I've been to a Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, it was my first time going to a Canadian one! We made a reservation for 6:30pm on a Saturday night, and our group sat at a long table with three half-and-half broth hot pots as well as lamb and beef slices, ready for some AYCE hot pot action. There was a self-serve hot pot ingredients area where you load up your plate with tofu, noodles, baby bok choy (gotta have the baby bok choy), lotus roots (^^), fish balls, and all the other typical hot pot assortments. There was also a sauce bar that consisted of the classic sesame paste, chili sauce, and other tasty/salty/interesting Asian sauces.

We were very tired after a busy day that night, so we feasted until our stomachs were about to burst (but apparently there was room for boba afterwards... because apparently there's always room for boba, even after AYCE hot pot). Overall, the quality and variety of the hot pot ingredients were above average, the meat quality was satisfactory, and the service was polite and attentive with broth refills and bringing more plates of meat.

NOTE: I don't think my clothes have ever smelled this much like hot pot after coming here! Maybe it's a Canadian hot pot thing eh?"}
{"text":"Little Sheep is the perfect place to go for lunch on a cold and chilly winter afternoon. If the soup doesn't warm you up, the spicy broth definitely will. This is my second time eating at a Little Sheep chain and this one was even better than the one in the States. It's buffet style so it would behove you to load up on the meat. The lamb is the best, followed by the beef. I also recommend getting a half and half spicy and normal broth. I only cook the meat in the spicy broth and everything else on the other side. This place also has a wide selection of vegetables, different types of tofu and mushrooms as well as a variety of noodles to select from. You can also help yourself to drinks at the soda fountain and they have an array of delicious desserts. I think I ate five or six freshly made mini sesame balls. I loved everything about this place from the quick service to the clean and modern look of the dining room. And the best part was how cheap it was for a buffet. Lunch came out to $13 + $1 weekend lunch + $2 for the spicy broth = $16. Not too shabby for a filling and satisfying lunch in the middle of Chinatown. This hot pot alone is worth the two hour drive from Vermont."}
{"text":"I lived in HK for 3 years and loved Little Sheep and when I came back for the holidays I was so excited to see that there was one in Montreal. I was a little disappointed, I don't really like the raw meat buffet style and there weren't that many varieties and options. So overall is was so-so."}
{"text":"We went for my first time on a Friday night with a reservation for 6. We were seated quickly but it took around 15 to 20 minutes before we were attended to by a waiter. Hot pot was $20.99 + $1 weekend fee per person, with $1 extra for the soup base. I had the non spicy soup was tasty with lots of ingredients like garlic, ginger, and spices in the pot. My girlfriend had the spicy one and she enjoyed it but it was too spicy after a while. The fresh chillies in her soup stock were a nice touch. 

This was a buffet style AYCE, and all the food was kept in one corner. There were unlimited drinks (non-alcoholic) and a station to mix your own sauces. They had just about everything you'd normally use except for raw eggs but that's fine with me. The vinegar was put right beside the soy sauce with tiny labels, which may have ruined someone's sauce but it didn't affect me. There were also some cooked foods such as spring rolls for those who can't wait for their food to cook before eating.

The raw foods were placed near the sauce station and fountain drinks. This placement was poorly planned, as everyone ended up being super crowded there, whether it was to get food or something else. With a max occupancy of 140, that can cause some trouble in peak hours. The place was nearly filled at the time we went and it was a bit annoying getting food.

However, the raw food selection was great. They had mushrooms (enoki and shiitake), all sorts of vegetables (watercress, coriander, nappa, bok choy), and at least 4 kinds of noodles. The seafood assortment included shrimp with heads on, cuttlefish, squid tentacles, and frozen mussels. Pig intestines and other weird organ stuff were included too, and also cow rumen. All kinds of fish balls, cuttlefish balls, and lobster balls were available too. I tried almost everything, and it tasted like it should, except for the fish/cuttlefish/lobster balls; those were too sweet.

The raw meats were a different story. It was super annoying having to order raw meats from the waiters separately even though it's included in the cost of the meal. Their meat selection that night was only lamb and beef. Maybe they have chicken but they didn't tell us about it when we asked. So when we asked them to bring us meat, they would bring 3 plates of maybe 6 small slices each for 6 people. If you've done hot pot before, you'd know that's nothing. So we ended up having to reorder constantly throughout the night. 

After 2 unrushed hours, we paid for our meal. There were no unexpected charges, and no charges for leftover food, though we didn't leave any food anyways. There was no gratuity added to our bill, which was also nice. They accept credit card, so it's a good change from other Asian restaurants. Overall it was a good experience. I would definitely come back on special occasions for my hot pot craving, but for the price, I might try somewhere a little cheaper or do it at home instead.

TL;DR
Good food, good selection, okay price, okay service, and really annoying flagging down waiters constantly if you want lots of beef or lamb for your hot pot."}

Gluttony is my favourite of the seven deadly sins. And it's probably yours too. That's why you're going to stuff your face with lamb at a restaurant plastered in cute little white sheep. You may want to pre-watch an episode of \"lamb chop's play along\" if you are feeling extra hungry and evil. My personal choice was Silence of the Lambs.

Be forewarned, the sweet smell of hotpot as you enter the restaurant is the same smell you will be leaving with... on your clothing. You may think that you can dodge the smelly steam vapours that emanate from the pot, but it's better to give up NOW and prepare ahead. You will be engulfed in soup clouds, so dress the part. Possibly appropriate attire: basketball jersey, snuggie, hair net, board shorts, adult diaper (for the hardcore overeaters), hazmat suit.

As a general strategy, I recommend that you load up on lamb slices and beef slices. They only take about 30 seconds to cook. Then intermittently try the other options (see above).

You may want to order the \"wheat gluten\" just for the sake of novelty. It arrives as 3 tennis balls. You throw them into the pot and they sit there for hours. You can bounce them up and down in the pot at first and they just float there. Then they gradually soak up grease until they wrinkle up like the fingertips of an old granny emerging from the sauna. At some point they are finished cooking. I'm not sure when. Then bite into it, and rip some off with your teeth. Chew whatever you can. They taste like the fingertips of an old granny emerging from the sauna. Or something like that. I have no idea what this is supposed to be.

Service is surprisingly strong, especially for china town.

Overall, this is a good hot pot considering the competition in the downtown core. In particular, if you like Lamb, this is a joint to check out.


INTRODUCTION FOR NOOBS (see Menu picture if you would like to follow along):

You probably want the \"Yin Yang\" broth. Each side has a different soup base. One is spicy, the other is herbal.

It's All You Can Eat. There is a dinner section of the menu, which you can only order from if you are paying the dinner price.

Lamb and Beef slices are not marked on the order form, you just ask for more from the wait staff. For everything else, use the the order form. 

You get 3 rounds to order, plus dessert.

Water / soy milk / plum juice are all free. I prefer soy milk.

Sauce. You get a small bowl to make your own sauce at the sauce station. You probably want to start with sesame paste or sesame oil. Experiment with the chive paste and fermented tofu. But there is plenty more... cilantro, green onion, vinegar, chili oil, chili sauce, etc. Don't forget to grab a raw quail egg and break it into your sauce bowl (if that sounds appealing).

BONUS TIP: I recommend fasting to some degree before or after hot pot. You will inevitably overeat. Do not schedule any sort of physical or mental activity or drive heavy machinery after hot pot."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving for some hot pot when we visited Toronto.  Little Sheep like their many other locations did it for us.  However, this particular location was so-so.  The customer service was poor.  It is buffet style but they don't give you extra plates asking you to reuse the same plates over and over.  Cheap way to save labor.  The soup was okay.  The meats was okay.  The food selection was also okay.  So overall, an average experience for me."}
{"text":"The restaurant purposely serve the lamb and other meats super slow so the customers can fill themselves up with the carbs first. They missed so many dishes we ordered and my family just lost patience at the end. When the bill came, the amounts didn't add up. For example the waitress told us that we get free drinks when paying cash but the bill was calculated on a lump sum and we had to calculate back to figure out they have in fact added the cost of drinks in the bill. The soup base was also not the greatest as it was too salty. Never visiting his place again! They are too scammy."}
{"text":"Don't let the 2 stars fool you. The food and service are good. Everyone here already mentioned the options you can get. Its the pricing structure that I am complaining about. Its a certain price for lunch vs dinner. And then on top of that you have to pay for the POT! So if you want a double pot to share with your date, its an extra $5 per person. Water is included but anything like tea and you have to pay extra. In the end, it ends up being a price for a really good buffet elsewhere or a nice dinner. I didnt like how all these ad ons are tacked on. I dont mind about the food price, but I want it all upfront so I can make an informed choice before I already have sat down. I would not return for this reason."}
{"text":"I would have to say the service is great (a bit surprised) even though we made reservations but our remain party was late, they didn't force us to order first. Everyone we ask for a refill, they are very friendly with the smile.

Food was not the greatest, there were flies around the sauce around, soya milk was pour from a large bucket to the fountain. You have bring your plate to grab food, but the damn plate is not deep enough to carry your food from falling.  Food was all over the floor.

Soup base made so much msg, salty enough you don't need sauce. 

In addition, the sauce selection was minimal.

Would I recommend this place? Not really.

Note: when you enter, you'll see a note on the door to stating \" please use the other way\"  lol"}
{"text":"Pro:

- Has lamb fondu meat slices as option. Has an good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian hotpot selection.

- Polite, attentive staffs.

- Near the metro, in the center of Chinatown.

Con:

- Their sea-food product, tofu and mushroom selections smells disgusting, and most definitely capable of inducing food poisoning on a given day.

- Their soft drinks tastes weird, in a \"left too long in the sun and diluted\" sorta way.

- Awful desert selection, you only have 2-3 choices and 2 of them taste funky, in a \"left too long on the counter\" sense.

-Disgusting washroom

Summary:
Stick to the meat and veggies, bring your own drink, don't use their washroom. And cook everything throughoutly yourself before putting it in the mouth.  

This place is a germ central"}
{"text":"I've been to a few hot pot places in Scarborough and Markham so I was happy to know there was a place closer to me.

We actually went to the asian store and bought our own hot pot flavouring with a bit more spice to it before we came to the restaurant. I'm glad we did because the hot pot base was a little underwhelming than what we are used to.

They have a good selection of menu items to eat, but since I've had more flavourful hot pots elsewhere, I would only come here if I didn't want to drive too far."}
{"text":"Absolutely a fun time with a group! I've been to the Brossard location and the Chinatown location. They both have different styles. Brossard is modern and casual, and the Montreal location is a little more for a night out with friends, and you can dress up. 

On the second floor of the building, depending on when you go, hard to find parking. You'll need to go up the stairs and I didn't see any handicap access ramp or an elevator.  The place isn't that large but can accommodate a group.

Brossard location, you have to leave your table and choose your own foods to cook, so there's limited staff to help.

Montreal location has a very friendly and helpful staff.  You choose the foods that you want and they bring it to your table. 

They had a few different food choices such as garlic beef, so be sure to ask what they have that Brossard doesn't have. 

All of the food was really fresh and the portions to share were very adequate. There can be a fee if you waste too much but they didn't charge us so it seems quite within reason.

The meat was a lovely quality, they have lamb and chicken as well. There's an extra lamb shank that you can order outside of the all you can eat price. The lamb shank was very good, a little small to share with more than one person. It was well seasoned and we all tried it and enjoyed it. 

The handmade noodles were so yummy, we all enjoyed the ramen noodles and please have the long flat rice noodles, so chewy, just lovely! 

There are plenty of sauces too! 

The Sake came warm and they poured it for us and directed us to keep it on the heating plate, yaaaasss!

The desserts at this location were very dried out, but in their defence, we arrived an hour before closing. But they had Sesame cakes, so delicious, that were perfect and soft, almost gooey. I could have just eaten sesame cakes for dinner!  Brossard location didn't have sesame cakes.

We had a fun evening, and they have some hard liquor, beer and Sake, where Brossard only has beer.

The website says that they have Mochi, but on close examination, I see they don't have it in Canada. I also asked to make sure, and they didn't even seem to know what Mochi was.


At closing they came to us with last call for food and drinks. We left with full tummies. Would definitely go back to this location before tee Brossard location. Mainly because I enjoy getting dressed for dinner and going downtown. If I were going for a lunch with kids, I'd go to the Brossard location instead.

Afterwards we had bubble tea at a little place just outside their door. Try the green tea and peach with lychee jelly! I asked for more green tea and less peach, very sweet if not. 

Great place to bring friends and family for a new experience."}
{"text":"I was happy to be at this restaurant because it gives friends and family, or couples, a chance to eat slowly and catch up. 

Slow eating is better for digestion and your blood sugar too! 

Lots of fresh food choices, vegan, vegetarian and those who want a plant based meal will really appreciate the greens and vegetable selections. 

There are also animal proteins such as pork style wonton dumplings, shrimps, beef and lamb, chicken pieces, different fish options too. If you are vegan/vegetarian you're best to get your own personal broth as others will be cooking meat in the broth. 

A very nice employee came by often to fill our stick pots with fresh broth. This location does not have the best desserts. Just peaches and mandarin orange  slices in simple syrup (possibly canned fruits). Some dry pastry, and a little sweet bun with glaze. 

If you have insulin resistance or diabetes there's no fresh fruit options for dessert. So if you have a desire for something sweet, maybe bring your own fruit. 

The music wasn't too loud and it was clean. I'll be trying the Montreal location soon. I'd recommend this place for casual dinner with friends, or family. All you can eat for under 22$ before taxes. Beer and wine available but no hard liquor. Soda fountain by the buffet.

Would definitely return, felt relaxed afterwards. 
One downfall, staff not very present. I had to stand at the kitchen and ask for plates ( chipped plates), cutlery, drinks, napkins, more than once, so did others from my table. 

Would have given another star for better service and a fresh choice of desserts, an apple at least..."}
{"text":"I came to Little Sheep Hot Pot for a UYE organized by Teresa C in the deep freeze of winter.  This restaurant is spacious.  The decoration is nice and modern.  

Customers are partially self served at Little Sheep.  After placing our orders, the waiter delivered the raw meat plates (lamb and beef), which we could re-order, to our tables.  We had to go to a serving area to obtain ourselves the other raw food, such as vegetable, chicken meat, pork belly slices, fish fillets, dumplings, fish/squid/meat balls, noodles, fungus, etc.  There were also plum juice, lemon iced tea, pop, etc.  I was quite happy with this arrangement, as I could get the food faster this way compared to waiting for servers to deliver them.  There were an okay quantity of selections; not massive, but the most popular ones were all present.  Whatever they had, they were fresh and clean.  There was a dipping sauce table, so you can mix your own sauce.

Note that the serving area had a lot of shelves, but many shelves were mislabeled.  It was not a big issue to our group, cause we just picked accordingly to the look of the food.  If we didn't know what something was, we just ate first asked questions later.

Services were not as prime as the food.  We got seated quickly.  The waiter serving us explained the menu to us in the beginning, but we were still confused.  He just left mid sentence!  Gone just like that, as if his attention was diverted.

Note also the menu says it is $20 AYCE.  This is not the true price because $20 does not include any soup broth; you get a pot of hot water only.  Soup broth costs extra $1.50 to $2.50."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best, from the moment me and my friends came in it wasn't all too great to begin with. 

The sauces were really watered down, and when we asked for more for something such as the beef they gave us a few extra slices on a small plate, when asked for more I seem to have been ignored and to the point I had to get up out of my seat and call a server down. 

It wasn't all too busy but I don't understand why some employees were just standing around and talking with each other. They charge extra for just about everything such as soup size and drinks! 

Skip this place and go to the better hotpots around the area. I recommend Celebrity."}
{"text":"My family of 5 were craving for hotpot so we came to this place from Brampton because it is the closest place.

The parking went well because it was a large parking lot with lots of spots. 

We were able to find a table right away because we arrived right before the traffic but the place ramped up very fast packing up the large facility

We received our broth right away, we chose the spicy and regular. Very good! But a little on the salty side but I enjoy salty. By the time we received our first condiments to throw inside the pot 50 minutes had past. I understand it was busy after we had sat down, but I noticed others were receiving their ingredients. I questioned the staff about our food multiple times until about the 4th time they realized it was getting really long so they brought out some ingredients.

I admit, I've never worked in a place like this but I'm really boggled what takes so long since the food is uncooked and only put on a tray and delivered to the table.

The saving grace for my review was that the food was good and because the wait took so long it gave my family some time to catch up.

The price came to about $150 for the 5 of us plus the unlimited drinks (extra charge). It was odd that they charged for the drinks because I've been to others where they don't charge."}
{"text":"Been here many times, and will be back many more. This is by far my favourite hot pot place. The service might be a bit slow (to be fair, it's always packed with people) but the food and selection is the best. This is one of the truly \"all you can eat\" restaurants of the little sheep franchise. Many others claim to be ayce but end up charging you more for this and that. This location is the best, no strings attached, eat whatever you want hot pot restaurant around.

As for price, it's average for an ayce restaurant."}
{"text":"Greetings all, who, likes good outings. This restaurant has fresh vegetables (oriental or otherwise) and seafood selections (specially, the shrimp is very sweet). The mushroom selection is outstanding whether is oriental or domestic. The fish is nice and come clean and fresh. The pot is not too spicy and tasted good. The ice cream and juice is included if you have palace for them. The surroundings are nice. The parking is difficult though. The waiter, explained what you will be having and the different prices. No, smile though from the cashier which we will let go this time. Check, the china town surroundings very nice specially the meditation.  If you are meat lover, you will like it there also, since there is a wide selections of meat chicken lamp and sausages do not forget the ice cream specially the chocolate (dark and less fat and sugar) . Nice place all around and healthy.  The children should enjoy it specially the fact that you will drink the soup after all gets cooked in it. Very clean and nice that is why I let it go a little on service. Enjoy outing in Montreal downtown ."}
{"text":"Only come here if you don't care about how you smell afterward. 
After you eat here, there is a strong odour that comes with you afterward. 
Their food tasted okay, but I heard people had diarrhea afterward, maybe their food is not that fresh..."}
{"text":"Pretty good hot pot place to try out. It had a lot of different sauces to choose from and a lot of different cuts of meat available. They also have several drink options such as plum juice, soy drink, and fountain drinks. I'm not much of a hot pot fan so I can't really tell the difference between good and bad hot pot. Despite that, i thought the flavours in the food weren't bad at all. Broth was flavourful and sauces were plenty.

It can get very hot in the restaurant and I would recommend leaving your jacket behind since the hot pot smell really sticks to your clothes afterwards."}
{"text":"Great food and variety. Lots of unusual choices you wouldn't find in a regular restaurant, which enhances the experience. The veges are awesome! The spicy broth is too spicy."}
{"text":"I love hot pot!  I think I've been to almost every hot pot place in GTA except for this one.  My first time here was a pretty good experience.

First thing I noticed when I walked in was the male waiter on duty was friendly and asked if I had hot pot before, and whether I would like a small (for 1 person) or larger hot pot (usually for 2 people).  

The standard soup was a chinese herbal soup base, I think even this basic soup was an extra $1 charge.  There were other soup options for a bit extra.  The ingredients you pick yourself at the buffet like area.  There were side dishes (seaweed, spicy bamboo shoots) and dessert in plastic containers and trays (coconut biscuits, prawn crackers, fungus dates cold sweet dessert).

For the drink fountain, they only had pop and plum juice when I went.  No chrysanthemum tea or others.  Not a big deal of course, better to have unlimited plum juice compared to other places where you need to pay extra.

Service was alright.  Would have liked 2 sets of chopsticks though ... one for raw food, one for cooked food.  Also I should have went for a larger pot since the soup got really thick from the ingredients near the end of my meal (they refilled it but I should have asked for them to completely change out the soup).

A wonderful place for hot pot, would recommend!  Looks modern and my clothes did not smell bad or anything afterwards."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to The Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot Restaurant. It was us \"N\" times been to this restaurant, but it was the first time having food at the Calgary location.  Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is a Chinese Hot Pot restaurant. It has so many locations in all over the world. There are lots of locations in Canada. There is only one location in Calgary. The Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot Restaurant in Calgary is located at 999 36 St NE #100a Calgary.

Environment:

The restaurant was opened around 11 am. We arrived Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot Restaurant around 11:30 am. The restaurant was not busy. We could get a table very easy. Inside the restaurant, it was very nice and clean.

Service:

After we sat down, the server brought the menu to the table. There were two different kinds of menus. One is for all you can eat and another one is lunch menu. We had the Lunch Menu to order. We ordered two lunch combos and two lamb strews for lunch. The food came out the kitchen fast.

Food:

The meat was super fresh. The soup base was very tasty. There are lots of dipping sauces, which is great.  Each combo includes noodles, vegetable, and meat. But, it was a super small portion. Also, the lamb strews were small and cold. I'm not very like it. But, my boyfriend loved them.

Price:

The prices of the lunch combos were around $15 include the tax. It was great. The lamb strews were over prices."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been meaning to try this place for a while and last night (Saturday) we finally got our chance.  We`ve never had a Mongolian style hot pot so we did not know how different (if at all) our meal was going to be, compared to what we`re used to (chinese style) and I`m happy to say, we were pleasantly surprised.  

We arrived around 6:30 p.m. and there was a long line up of people so we ended up waiting about 30 min before we were seated at a small table with 2, built-in induction cooktops for our individual broth.  Please note, they do not take reservations here so if you`re going with elderly people, children...etc you may want to get there early.

They`re pretty efficient here and even before we were seated, we were asked what kind of broth we wanted for our meal.  Upon being told that it was our first time, the waiter told us that we could have regular (chicken broth), medium or spicy broth with an option of doing half and half.  We opted for 1 regular and 1 spicy broth.  

Two small individual pots holding our broths laden with various dried fruits, peppercorns, barks and herbs arrived almost immediately, accompanied by 3 plates of thinly sliced beef, lamb and pork.  My spicy broth had a layer of seeped chili oil from what must have been 30+ dried chilies that were swimming around.  What this meant, I found out, as our meal progressed was that the broth became spicier with continued boiling of these chilies, so be warned.  However, waiters do come around to top your pots up with regular chicken broth during your meal so you`ll experience a little relief from heat immediately following these top ups.  At least for a little while.  

There is a refrigerated (I`m not sure how well refrigeration worked) section holding various meats, tofu, seafood, dumplings, rice cakes and veggies that are self-serve as well as a table of (rather messy) sauces you can make dipping sauces for your hot pot.  So if you`re someone who cannot cook (or combine flavors too well), you may be out of luck there.  

There was a standard set up of soft drink dispenser as well as another dispenser filled with sweetened soy milk, cold green tea and some sort of plum beverage (also self-serve and all you can drink), included in the price of your meal of $18.99 pp (weekend rate).  Next to it sat 3-4 buffet style servers (cold) of ho-hum looking dessert items, looking neglected and rather sad.  They also have white fungus and goji berries stewed in syrup which looked most promising at first glance, canned pineapples and canned mandarin oranges for post-meal wind-down.  

The freshness of the self-serve ingredients seemed decent enough but what we disliked the most was the fact that communal tongs were being used to handle all raw ingredients without much regard for cross-contamination.  Many of the tongs were carelessly thrown back in the stainless steel containers after being used (by how many people, I don`t want to know) and often the handles were sitting in a pool of thawing meat juice, awaiting next patron.  

The same hygienic concerns extended to the actual cooking at the table as we were not provided extra sets of chopsticks to handle raw ingredients (meats, especially) to cook them in the broth.  We had to use our hotpot ladles to place the raw ingredients into the broth and let the ladles come to a boil along with the ingredients before using our chopsticks to fish out our meal.  Again, this was a big minus for me.

What we liked the best was their flavourful broths which were clean, complex and rich all at the same time.  The seasoning was good enough that we didn`t really need the dipping sauce to add extra seasoning to the cooked items yet, we were able to takes sips of hot broth as it bubbled away on our table.  

We tried the fungus and goji berries stewed in syrup to finish our meal and this is what down-graded the solid 3.5 stars to a 3 (even a 2.5).  The over-cooked white fungus sat in a thick pool of uninspiring and flavourless syrup.  I could have done without tasting this dessert which strangely made my teeth ache for rest of the evening.  Yuck.

Overall, 3 stars.  If we return for a second visit, it would be solely due to their outstanding broth which may just be good enough."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with their service. It was my first time here and they took the time to explain how the pricing works. We were asked the type of soup base we like and was given a seat within 5 minutes of waiting even when we were told it would take 15 minutes. There's a fair amount of variety for food and to my surprise, they had a lot of vegetables (something absent in most restaurants when eating out)."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a close friend of mine and now it is a place we go to once every 4 months.  The soup is great, I opt for the spicy as the regular just doesn't cut it for me.  There are a lot of items to choose from to add to your hot pot and they are brought out fresh.  I am not a big tofu fan however, it goes so well with hot pot that I order more tofu than anything else!  I prefer the lamb to the beef as I feel the separates quite easily and leaves a residue in your soup.  The service is not the best as you may have to get up and ask for some help but I don't find it too big of a deal.  One thing I must warn you though is that DO NOT WEAR GOOD CLOTHES as you will come out smelling like the soup.  The smell really sticks to your clothes.  It is a fun experience and the quality is good.  I'll be back to get my fix again in a few months."}
{"text":"I have never visited another hot pot restaurant so although I can't compare the quality to other places, I had a really great time here. Came with a few friends and we all opted to have our own hot pot. I chose the spicy broth which was delicious. I am not a red meat fan and basically never eat it but I found myself eating a so much beef and lamb because it is so delicious. We also ordered a variety of dumplings, noodles, vegetables and everything was delicious. Service was a little sparse but it wasn't really an issue. Would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Totally agree with the MSG overload comment.

Our experience started out from 5 star and deteriorated as the evening progressed. We spent about 2 hours in total. Service was quick and efficient. Little concerned about the raw meat being handled though.. Raw cuts of lamb, beef and especially chicken were just served as is and the waiters didn't seem to wash hands after touching the plates they were served in. Offered menus etc casually. 

The flavors... amazing at first.. but after an hour of the broth boiling, the flavors just seemed (as expected) to taste only of MSG :( 

But anyway, the experience was fun and we had a good time! Got so stuffed! My boyfriend even tried the desserts! (I was too full) He liked it very much! Some of the eclair like things barely had any cream fillings but there were some with a decent amount.. So inconsistencies there.. Same with egg rolls.. Too much of wrapper and barely any filling.. 

Note: The broth is charged extra from the AYCE. AYCE during the weekends is $20.99 per person for dinner. So it should be about $50 for 2 people roughly. 
There's fountain soda serving canada dry, sprite, nestea, coke, fanta and diet coke. Included in the AYCE along with the desserts and condiments. 

They do mention charging an extra person's AYCE prices if the leftovers are over 100grams in weight. But during a busy night like Saturday night, they barely check since there's a wait at most times. They don't seem to take reservations either.

So bottom-line: worth a visit for the experience. Enjoy while the flavors last! Recommend garlic beef and chicken :)"}
{"text":"It was my first visit at this restaurant and I was surprised at how spacious, clean and open this place was - not the usual layout for a typical Chinese restaurant.

Despite the lack of variety, the quality of the food was very good. Unlike 1pot, they have enoki mushrooms. The seating was very comfortable as well. AC was blasting to let customers enjoy the heat from the hot pot.

I knew going in that it would be more pricey than other AYCE hot pot. It was $23.99 for adults ayce, $10.99 for the broth (which was very yummy) and additional charges for beverages outside of tea or water. Luckily, I had bought a groupon earlier this summer (Pay $11 for $20 worth of hot pot for 2 people), and when we sat down, one of the workers told us that since we are a party of 2, we can opt for the mini pot priced for $5 instead of $10.99. We went with that option since a small pot would be sufficient for the two of us. We had iced water and tea for our choice of drinks. I ordered an egg to add to my sauce bowl and it was an additional $1 charge. Overall, it came out to $38 for two people (before tips). We were also given a $5 voucher to use for next visit. It was a very good price for what we had. I would return again for sure, but I'm a little unsure if I would return as frequent due to the full price that I would have to pay outside of groupon and mini pot charges. Definitely worth it with a coupon and mini pot - which is recommended for a party of 2."}
{"text":"Little Sheep is your typical, average hot pot spot. And that makes sense, since Little Sheep is just one of many franchises scattered across the world. 

They have a decent selection of ingredients (beef, chicken, squid, shrimp, veggies, etc.). The service is average. 

There's usually a wait at lunchtime or dinnertime."}
{"text":"I have to sign up an account to say something. I'm traveling to Montreal for a few days. I was excited to try out the hot pot over this place. It was on 6/10/17 around 9:40 pm. Me and my friend saw this place on yelp so we walked in. There is a young man by the front desk greeting us. We want a table for 2 people. But he said they are closing. I checked the time they put on yelp is 11:30 pm, he said it should be at 11pm. This is the first mistake that they made, because it could mislead all customers who want to eat hot pot and come here after they close. It is a big disappointing. Second, even they close at 11 pm, there is no way they reject people by 1 hour ahead they close. We just have to walked away. I don't understand why they do that, probably the worker want to get off early so they don't want more customer to come in. So I'm just writing this review to let people know that if you want to come here at night, maybe you should manage your time ahead."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been to a hot pot AYCE so I didn't know how anything worked. I came with a group of 8 on a Sunday night ($20.99+$1 extra charge for weekends+extra for soup broth). After 30 min, a waiter came over with glasses and told us where we can get drinks. I really liked the soya milk, but they ran out half way through our service. The servers are all Chinese and didn't really explain well how things worked. We had to figure everything out ourselves which was fine but it would've been nice.

The menu is really confusing if you're not Chinese, it's missing soup base info and meat options. The spicy soup base is REALLY spicy, luckily I got the half & half so I started mixing both bases, but even then I didn't know I wasn't supposed to drink the soup base like I could with the normal soup.  

The sauces were good though. And the selection of meatballs, seafood, veggies, and noodles was really big which I liked (although there were flies). And the buns (not sure what they're called), get all the buns while you can especially when they're fresh, really good. Also, they refill your broth for free. Although the noodles need to be cut, they are a pain to try to scoop out and put into my bowl. 

Something also to note, the servers will only give you lamb and beef, but their website says they have 12 other meat options (pork, beef, lamb and chicken) but they don't mention that. The meat options aren't in the serve-yourself area, you have to flag (literally raise your hand and wave) down a server and order from them.

I don't know if I'd go back...maybe a different location at a cheaper time, probably with someone who can speak Chinese. $25 per person for the type of food and service you get here isn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Decent place for hot pot, but be prepared to smell a lot after. Do note that this place is usually quite busy. They also only take reservations for 6 or more people.

So most of the food here is self-serve aside from the sliced meat (pork/beef/lamb). They have a good range of sauces (ex. Sesame, BBQ, chives, minced garlic, fermented bean paste...etc). They have two broth options (regular or spicy or split pot). My go-to is the regular. For hotpot, things I personally eat most are lamb, fungus, mushrooms, taro, lotus root, fish, wintermelon, radish and so on. The satay chicken is also pretty good.

When I visited on Saturday, the sesame sauce was watered down. The drinks here are also watered down (soy milk is basically a ton of sugar). They have plum juice, soy milk and a range of carbonated fountain drinks. For dessert they have canned peaches, this sweet fungus dessert, fried buns with condensed milk...etc. Fried buns are alright if they're warm and shrimp chips are good if they're freshly made.

My family comes here to get our lamb fix and veggies. Service here is decent since they refill your broth from time to time. They do sometimes forget to serve the meat that we order though depending on the person. Overall it's alright, you're here for hot pot so as long as there is a good variation of ingredients and it's fresh, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I can't go an entire winter without going to Mongolian hot pot at least a couple of times. It's the perfect remedy for a cold and windy day!

The concept is simple, it's an all-you-can-eat where you cook your food in a broth that's either spicy or mild. Go for spicy if you can handle the heat, it's so much more flavorful. They have a large selections of items (lamb,beef,tofu,seafood,fish, all kinds of veggies,different types of noodles) so bring your appetite with you.
I have a soft spot for the lamb, tofu, bok choy and thick noodles.

They also have a small selection of deserts but you can't go wrong with the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Une fondue chinoise à volonté pour 21$, tout est dit.
Un choix incroyable de mets aussi originaux que classiques, fruits de mer, agneau, boeuf, légumes, kelp, champignons, lotus, ou spécialités asiatiques diverses, dans un bouillon simple, épicé ou mixte, de quoi ravir les fines bouches comme les gros mangeurs!
Pensez à réserver car l'endroit est très prisé et la file d'attente peut vite devenir longue.
Une excellente soirée du nouvel an chinois!"}
{"text":"After having dinner multiple times at Little Sheep in Pasadena and Montreal, I was thrilled to see there was an other one so close to me. 

There are a few differences between the Little Sheep franchises... Per instance, at the Little sheep in Pasadena, you order (for the all you can eat) on a paper (like at the sushi buffet) but in Scarborough, you actually go grab your food from giant fridges yourself, which I like. 

There is a huge selection of sauces, seafood, meats and vegetables. I would recommend the larger noodles since they are freshly made and the crab balls. 

Soda/pop is complimentary (as well as certain juices), but there is no ice for your drinks therefore, you better enjoy room temperature soda. 

I love spicy foods but the spicy soup broth at Little Sheep is quite tangy therefore, if you can't handle spicy (or have any sort of stomach issues) STAY AWAY! (Your mouth and in some cases toilet will be forever greatful!)"}
{"text":"I must say, Little Sheep is an excellent choice for casual hot pot. You can order either 1 large hot pot or a small individual hot pot, and the soup base costs extra. There's a selection of cold spring rolls and manto in the sauce area, and you can drink either soy milk, sour plum juice, and iced lemon water. 

You can order three rounds of dishes to put into your hot pot, and the soup heats up quickly so that you don't have to wait for long. The atmosphere itself is rather quiet during the afternoon, but I can imagine it being a hot spot for dinner. The lunch AYCE costs around $20 per person after you add in the money you spend for the soup!

Favourites: cold spring rolls, sweet soy milk, garlic beef
Dislikes: garlic chicken (ugh)"}
{"text":"I gotta say the thing that was most notable was the fact that the soup base was way too filled with MSG. My tongue was numb by the end of our meal!

Also, they were heavy handed with the salt.

Food freshness was fine but the area in which the AYCE food was placed could be better maintained in terms of tidyness and cleanliness.

Service was on par for what you'd expect at AYCE places."}
{"text":"I tried to go to this place with a friend a few months back. It was closed for \"renovations\". Hmm..should have left it at that.

This time I was invited by a friend from out of town, so I figured what the hell. I'm adventurous.

This place was packed. We waited 25 minutes to get a table. and it was a weeknight. And at $17 for the buffet, it ain't a bargain.

I guess i'm not a big hot pot fan to begin with, so I probably wasn't going to leave being blown away, but this was fairly disappointing. The broth's were pretty flavourless.I shared the large half-spicy-half-herb one. The spicy one is basically boiling water with chilies and Szechwan peppercorns thrown in. WAY too spicy. The herbal one is hot water with cloves and other random spices thrown in. I think the best thing I ate there was a lamb meatball that was a frozen rock before I threw it in. I don't even want to think where the seafood had been festering before it came out. 

Oh yeah, the baby roach that ran across the top wall of our booth at the end was a nice touch. Apparently that \"renovation\" didn't fix the problem. I sense another failed health inspection coming.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food, very clean.  Food comes really quickly and the broth is amazing. Only reason why I rated it a 4 is because the cashier said he \"could not\" split our bill. Um, okay. It's a place oriented towards groups of people. But apparently one person must pick up the tab!"}
{"text":"Decent food, the chilies in the soup burn your mouth, not something I will do again but it's a great experience, and lots to choose from on the menu

Spicy broth is the one you should choose!!!


Tip: careful I burned my tongue all night"}
{"text":"Ate here our first night staying in Montreal, my first time having hot pot. We got the 'mixed' pot, one side spicy, the other not. Plenty of meat kept coming to the table (beef, lamb) for boiling and other options were available via the buffet (vegetables, tofu, fish, chicken livers)"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came here for our gathering, I love their hot pot a lot, and during the time they have all you can eat for one fix price, it was awrsome. We ate lots vegetables, and the lady who works there was very nice to us, she knew we love the spanich, she gave us a big bucket. So we enjoy so much that day, it was super great experience at this shubu"}
{"text":"It was different. You grab your own food and I really enjoyed that. A self serve own single hot pot and cooked food and dessert. The meat came out fresh so that has to be ordered. Overall I mean can't really go wrong with hotpot cause you cook it yourself. Broth was alright usual and I felt the self serve pick up could of been more up to date and not old. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"The place is always packed for dinner on a brutally cold winter day. It's definitely a comfort food spot to warm up our chilled body and belly. 
Although they say this is a Mongolian hot pot joint, I have to clarify that the hot pot style is Northern China - something very different from Southern China (Cantonese) style. The soup base is full of medicinal herbs and exotic spices, whereas Southern style got pot like to use actual soup base. 
That being said, you really don't need much dipping sauce as the food will be strong in flavour after cooked in hot pot. I keep a small bowl of self mixed dipping sauce on the side just for kicks. 
Aside from the soup base, I don't see anything else that would make this place unique. The selection of food is very standard and lack cleanliness. So if you are not used to greasy dirty hot pot joints, you might find it repulsive. And yes, this place stinks (only if you don't like herbal medicinal food). And in that case, you might be better off dining at a Cantonese style hot pot restaurant (which is likely as greasy and dirty).
Although the meal is about $25 after tip and tax, the true cost is likely 40-50 as now you will need to send everything you wore to dry cleaning to get rid of this hot pot smell. Hope you wore something cheap and replaceable in case you need to trash/burn it!"}
{"text":"The service is mediocre and the food is fine. I don't enjoy the atmosphere as I walk in but the decorations look creative but there's just no spark! The broth isn't the greatest but they can definitely make it spicy! Everything you order comes out at a decent pace but the broth need more seasoning, it's a good way to moisten the rice and cook the meat but can't sip it, like soup I won't."}
{"text":"The food quality is great. The broth was full of flavor but was a little bit salty and could easily get reallyyy salty as you keep boiling and eating. The service was fine. The only thing I hate was the garlic chicken. Will come back."}
{"text":"Great explanation of how things work (not the 1st time hot potting), good services, Meat/veggie/Soy milk in general are top notch quality. 

oh and it is CLEAN! you see employees cleaning chairs and tablet when it is not so busy. Washroom is very clean and modern also."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you smell a very distinct smell, which of course makes sense because of the spices in the broth. This place was jam packed the day we came.. but I definitely didnt understand what was so great about the food. Broth was not as good as I thought it would be, the overload of spices in the broth kept numbing my tongue.

I really did give it a chance though. Definitely wont be returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!

Please see my blog for more info. and pictures :)

{"text":"I've been wanting to try Hot Pot for a while and so when I saw a groupon for little sheep I decided it was a great chance to try it out and boy was I wrong. We got the half spicy half regular pot you have to pay extra for the broth so on top of the $22 you pay a person you also have to pay $5 for the pot. This isn't your typical all you can eat as you only get 3 rounds to order so make sure you order enough the first 2 then whatever else the last round.

The broth started out tasty overall I love spicy soup the spicy broth had way too many dried whole chillies in it and although the broth wasn't that spicy the chillies were annoying to have to keep picking out. As you cook the meat the water gets tastier but it also becomes really fatty which is pretty nasty to see. The yellow noodles overall were our favourite as they were super tasty.

The staff didn't pay much attention to what we were ordering so I'm sure we didn't get to try all the meats on the menu the self serve sauce bar is loaded with lots of great sauces for adding into soups or dipping meat into. 

Probably won't return here as for the price I can get an amazing dinner else where."}
{"text":"Good, not great. For $17.99 I think I could have had a better meal elsewhere. Maybe if I ate more food I would have felt like this was better value.

Some complaints: I don't love the idea of using the same tongs for meat and vegetables. There need to be more tongs. Also, the ventilation in the restaurant needs to be improved. Steam from the table next to mine was blowing directly into my face."}
{"text":"Came here with family for christmas eve supper. The restaurant was packed! As a table of six we were sat in one of the booths. The table only had one hot pot, so we found it a bit difficult to cook all the food we wanted. There was a good selection of items on the all you can eat menu. Wish there were some ready to eat items for free as well though. 

We made several orders during our visit, not one of them came out in the correct proportions we had written down on the sheet. Our last order didn't even come out, we had to ask several times for even a few of the items to come out to us. The items that did come out was great quality, and was yummy all around. Their lamb shoulder and mutton dumplings are super yummy! Wish I could have eaten more of it though.    

There was a continuous lineup just to get condiments, but we didn't mind waiting as it was always stocked up. The servers were super attentive at filling our ice teas up, they were never left empty for long. 

Overall, a good experience, will have to ask for a table with another hotpot next time we have a party of more than 4."}
{"text":"I became obsessed with this place in 2008. My sister and I come here so often that our parents have decided not to join us anymore. I love the variety of food offered and I really love the fact that it's all-you-can-eat. I think the lamb meat is the best and is super tasty with their broth. It used to be a buffet-style where you get up and serve your own food but they changed it to ordering it on a slip. It's still all-you-can-eat but the portions they give aren't always accurate so you have to keep asking for more.

I usually get the individual small pots when I come here which is very cute and personalized. It gets a little difficult when the party is too big so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're more than 6 people. The yin yang broth (half spicy half non-spicy) is excellent and you get the best of both worlds. 

It's rare to find all-you-can-eat Xiao Fei Yang restaurants so enjoy it here! I've eaten at this chain in three different countries and Montreal has the only locations that are all-you-can-eat. 

When you go make sure you don't wear a shirt that you plan on using again for the rest of the week!"}
{"text":"The set up was very different compared to the San Gabriel location we went to a week prior. Most of the items were self serve with the exception of sliced lamb and beef which they automatically place on your table as soon as your broth arrives. 

We actually preferred the efficiency of the service. Although there were only two servers - their jobs were really just to keep the meat coming so we never had to wait long between rounds. There were no papers to fill out or to be collected. No veggies or side orders to follow up. You need anything other than sliced lamb or beef? Go get it yourself. 

Although the spread was plentiful, the self serve station can be better maintained. There were so many flies lurking around. And the layers of grease built up found at the soda machine - I will take the water instead please. 

Overall - $23 plus tax and tip per person - not a bad option to battle the Canadian cold."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this place, and hotpot in general, by an old high school friend.  At first, I had zero idea what hotpot really was so she had to explain it before I ended up going.  I don't regret it!

For those that do not know, hotpot consists of you selecting various foods and placing them in a \"hot pot\" of broth / spices, etc for them to cook so you can eat them, on a mini stove top.  This place in particular is all you can eat (AYCE).

The parking lot itself is a pretty good size as long as you aren't looking to park right in front of the place.  There are a lot of businesses in this plaza so you might have to park closer to the bank in order to get a spot.  Since the plaza's pretty small, this shouldn't pose a problem, even at peak hours.  If you're coming from north of the place itself, you'll want to turn left at the traffic light before the plaza itself because turning left from Warden isn't fun.  They actually recently redid their sign outside so it looks a little nicer now.  The inside is clean for the most part but with so many customers through the day (I've gone several times, but only for dinner), that can be hard to keep up all the time.

Little Sheep Hot Pot does not take reservations for any \"small groups\" (whatever that means) so you'll have to walk in.  This place gets super busy at peak hours (which usually is after 6:30pm on weekdays, even earlier on the weekend).  Not only this, but the wait can be really long and they really don't have much space near the door for you to sit / stand.  So go early -  I usually like to go around 5 or 5:30.

The food is pretty tasty.  They have a lot of selection for it too.  They have a ton of veges, meat, seafood, etc.  They seem to slowly change their selection over time and one of my favourites, the cucumbers, aren't there any more.  I like simple foods, what can I say.  Anyways, as a word of warning to the type of people that are really cautious about their food: the tongs for the food aren't clamped down so the ones for raw meat and the ones for the veges can very easily get mixed up.  It doesn't matter too much in the long run because all your food goes in the hot pot anyway, but it's worth mentioning.  As for their soup base, they only have \"original\" and spicy but I like their original so much I really don't care if they have other types.  They have soy milk, several different soft drinks and a few others you get on your own too.

The service, in general, has been really good.  I once came reasonably late and the waitress seeing people at the door wouldn't put away her phone, even when I was talking to her about wait time (she told me 10 minutes and there were still four of five parties ahead of me 20 minutes later).  She was pretty terrible.  Outside of that, the workers there are pretty happy to serve you so if you need to refill your soup or get more meat, do not hesitate to ask them - they won't bite!  They're pretty quick to get you what you want too so no worries there.

All in all, this place has been really a great place to go with a few friends.  If you like hotpot, I could recommend this place for sure.  Does it compare to other hotpot places?  My answer is \"I'm not sure\" because I've only been to one other hotpot place.  So I'm not the greatest person to ask about that."}
{"text":"Make sure you take cash. My family and I wanted to try the Little Sheep here in Mississauga. We have Little Sheep in Houston.

The food is good and the service ok. If you need water make sure you ask them to leave a pitcher for you. Since they are going to get a gratuity for more then 6 they won't be back to check on you for sometime. But what can I expect... It's an Asian restaurant????"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience at the little sheep chain ever! 
1. Soup base is way too salty. You almost have to drink lots of beverage to balance out the taste, which leaves little stomach space for food. 
2. Orders were not getting filled. At one point, the waitress told us to tell her what we want instead and she'll bring them over. What's the point of filling out the order sheet then?
3. Cash only -- we all know what that means.
The fact that I created a Yelp account to rant about it says it all. LOL
I definitely will not return and will not recommend the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was fast compare to what I've read about it here on Yelp.
The food was ok with enough variety that make me and my friend full at round one.
I recommend you call a head to see if it was crowded.
They take cash, credit and debit now and they have an atm at the restaurant with 1.5$ extra fee to take out cash."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday (May 31, 2016). My friend and I went for dinner which costs $21.99. I also used a groupon, haha. I'd probably go here again with the groupon.

Service: 
The restaurant was very clean and modern. Loved the interior design. 

You're given three rounds. I'm reading some reviews that 3 rounds is the maximum but our server actually said we can go more than 3 rounds, they'd just give us another sheet. Also, our server was named Han, and he was super friendly! He'd check up on us every now and then and made us feel very welcomed. Food came quick and they refilled our broth whenever it was needed. 

Food: 
Food was pretty good. The broth was different from what I usually eat. You can split the pot into two for one spicy, and one mild. The spicy broth was WAY too spicy for me! 

The beef, pork and lamb were pretty fresh and so were the vegetables. It was odd that they didn't have tongs for the meat. Instead, they gave us an extra pair of chopsticks, which is no biggie for me.

For dessert, you're given green tea/red bean icecream, or fried bun. All were really good! The green tea and red bean icecream were rich."}
{"text":"Great place! Very spacious, not a feeling of crowdiness even if the place was full by the time we left.

When we arrived, we were greeted and offered either two places with our own heater, or a shared heater with a big pot half normal, half spicy.

The ingredients were very fresh and easy to cook, even for someone who is far from being a \"cordon bleu\".  The meats and dumplings are a must!

There is a self service soft drinks fountain  and water pitchers to take to your table, also some desserts. Traditional jasmin tea could also make part of the menu, so it would make it a bit more \"traditional\" in addition to the very \"western\" option....

There are many options of food, and all of them are delicious and one doesn't feel too bloated after realizing we ate that much!

Decor also is interesting especially, a mural depicting an ancient mongolian scene and a column with inscriptions in mongolian characters."}
{"text":"Went there on a saturday night.  Restaurant was packed but luckily we made a reservation ahead of time.  My family and I booked the little hut that they have in the corner of the restaurant which was really nice.  A heads up if you booked the hut as well, it tends to get really cold as there is a AC/Ventilation system right on top of the hut.

If you are going to this restaurant and have already gone to a little sheep mongolian hot pot either downtown or uptown, do NOT expect some of the same services.  

1. They do not have a self serve appetizer bar with the cold noodles and the potato salads which was a big issue for me. (-1 star)
2. They do not have a self serve drink machine, and you have to pay extra for drinks (-1 star)

The quality of the food itself was good, I was happy with it but they kept messing up our orders.  The first order, we asked for 5 plates of chicken, beef, and lamb, but only 1 plate of lamb came.  The second time we ordered the chicken and beef, it still didnt come... We had to explicitly tell our server that we wanted the chicken and the beef before they brought it to us.  Maybe it was because we went on a weekend and they were really busy. (-1 star)

Other than that the overall experience was ok.  The restaurant is still new and clean so thats a + and we didn't have to wait at all for our table.  Book ahead of time if you are going to try this on a busy day!! (+1 star)"}
{"text":"Hot pot is always good, no matter where you do it since you just grab the food you like and basically let it in the pot until it's ready to eat. The clear broth taste really good there, except there's a lot of MSG. It is so strong that when you leave the restaurant, the smell stays on all of your clothes for days."}
{"text":"Yummy hot pot, good selection of hot pot items. Only downside is the desert selections are very small, only cake and shrimp chips :/"}
{"text":"Went here with my bf and brother for the first time to try hot pot. For first impressions - we were already impressed, the restaurant was clean, lighting was bright and clear and the place was very spacious (very accommodating for large groups). 

We had a choice of sharing a pot or individually. We obviously picked individual. They had two different broths spicy or mild or you can pick half and half. This place was an AYCE but we definitely got our money's worth!

They had a large selection of food, from different fish balls to seafood all the way to different types of noodles! They also had fountain drinks but I found it watered down - also found the dessert selection to be a little disappointing but remember you came here for HOT POT not for a Mandarin dinner buffet

Overall this place was a great place to go with friends, the broth was amazing and a fair amount of food selections. Also, if you're a first timer I recommend on getting the half/half!!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. It's quite spacious and accommodating. The employees are very nice too. 

There's a selection between a small single soup base, a half/half pot, or a big one. 
Spicy is SPICY so be careful. 

A huge selections of meats and seafood with plenty of veggies to go with it. 
The only reason why I gave it a three star was because I found plenty of fruit flies lurking around the food area. It's all you can eat so stuff yourself."}
{"text":"I have been too a little sheep previously at the States but they did not have all you can eat. I went yesterday with a couple of friends and I was glad this location has all you can eat!

This place has an interesting style of serving thing. For non-meat items (fish balls, dumplings etc) they have it all displayed out in an area for you to grab yourself along with all the sauces. Some people may find it a bit dirty, but I like how it allows myself to get exactly what I want and how much I want. Meat wise, it seems they only have beef, lamb and pork. But that is honestly all I need. On top of that, they also have self serve curry fishballs and my personal favourite: 'fried man tou' (fried bread) where they have a bottle of condensed milk for you to add to the bread. Their ayce also includes all you can drink (usually costs extra in other places). They have all the pops as well as soy milk and plum juice.

I want to point out that I was fairly happy with their service. As far as I remember there were only 1 male and 1 female serving the whole restaurant. Both were kind and brings you want you want really fast. I like how they come around and refilling our soup before we even ask.

I enjoyed this place. On week nights it only costed each person ~25 dollars + tips which in my opinion was a lot cheaper than other AYCE places around here. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is my fav place. Their broth is amazing. Very deph in flavor, and a soothing aftertaste, pleasant on it's own, which is very fun to drink at the end of the meal. My sis was starting a cold, but it got zapped away from all those herbs in their broth. Awesome comfort food. Spicy Heaven.

I bought their broth package from a grocery store that had this restaurants logo on it, and it was not the same at all. It was just the basic base :\"oil, salt, fermented soy beans, berries, and chemicals\", the restaurant adds a lot more herbs to their version, and you can clearly see it. I inspected a large seed in the restaurnts broth, even bit into it, and it was a eucalyptus seed, which explains why it zapped my sis's cold. They probably put in a lot of other herbs too, which is why I always feel so good after :3 I love their broth xp

A lot of fun variations in their menu, even when they've ran out of certain items. Their lotus root and cow stomach (lower/softer tripe?) are my fav items, never tried them before experimenting here xp

Their blood pudding was bland, and their baby squid was tough as well as their rice cakes because I don't know how to cook all of these lol So better order what you know about. But after looking on youtube, I'm going to try the rice cakes again, and cook them much longer.

They refill your pot with non-spicy broth (always on time for us). Since we always get the half non spicy and half spicy broth, which is usually very spicy (yet amazing), I think next time I want to try to ask for the same half divided pot, but both sides with their spicy broth so i can separate the seafood from the land meats. Their non spicy broth is good, but I prefer the fire broth cause it has a nice kick to it :) Would be nice if they could place all the large chilli peppers in a tied mesh bag though, as well as their other large seasoning pieces, so it's easier to find our smaller added items. (Fk it, I'm emailing them lol)

Like all AYCE places, they \"forget\" parts of our order, but after awhile, I caught on why. We order too much in one order, so it makes sense that they try to \"help\" out by leaving some out so that we're not stuck with force feeding ourselves so we don't get stuck with paying for left overs that we can't take home. Was annoying at first, until I actually appreciated it by the end when I would get too full to finish. It's just best to go slow and try not to order too much on each round.

They have a \"make your own\" diping sauce area. Not labbeled though, which is bad for me, cause I don't know what I'm doing, and made a disaster. I had to beg the waiter to make me one, and what he brought me was BOOM awesome! I tipped him extra just for that to encourage them for the next time my dumbass comes in lol or at least label it. I guess they never had a problem with labeling because the people who go there already know what everything is, since it's not knew to them.

This may be my fav place, but my family doesn't like coming here as often as I do because they don't like loosing food in the broth and having to find it. It would be nice to have a type of \"net\" to hold small items together so that we can stop them from overcooking easier or at least put them on scewers, I don't know. I wonder if they would let us bring our own...

Seating is comfortable, service is fast as long as the place is not full. Careful about ordering a lot, it's hard to fill the small tables, so pace yourself since you don't want to waste anyways. Suggest to save the noodles for last, to get the flavor of all the ingredients you added.

The \"Buffet\" station is where you get your desert, make dipping sauce, and free soft drink refils. Desert are simple crispy pastries, but good with the heated sweetened condensed milk you get to pour yourself, nothing to really brag about, just helps with digestion after. But the best round pastries run out, so I don't suggest you go late if you care for it.

Because I'm tempted to eat so much here, it's better to go early and spend the rest of the day burning off everything eaten. If you're not a big eater, 30$ is a lot of money but worth it if interested in having many diff items that are normally separated because they're expensive. This is a nice place to take your time and eat slow in, really enjoy your conversation with your peers and have fun managing the food in the hotpot.

I wish we could take the remaining broth to go home with, it's that good! But they don't allow it, probably because they rather people pay to eat there. But for someone like me who doesn't eat out often, it would have been nice, instead of them throwing it out.

I would love it if they had the stretchy type of rice cakes here! I think they can be frozen, so I'm sure they could manage it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time, it was tolerable. But second time around, it just went downhill :( Most people I know seems to love this place. But I hope I can shed some light on why this restaurant would deserve a 2-star.

The first time I've ever heard of Little Lamb was in Hong Kong. Not only did they offer all-you-can-eat hot pot, it was also a place for delicious dim sum! So far, so good.

(1st Review - April 2012) About a year ago, my friends started mentioning Little Lamb Hot Pot in Toronto, and I was really intrigued to give it a try. I guess it was during a weekday, there were plenty of tables available, no one was bumping shoulders, and it was a good environment to catch up with friends.

I enjoy that you can go out to the open fridge and buffet table to select what you want - from appetizers and entree items to drinks and desserts. As for the meat, you can order through the waiter as many plates as you want. They actually give you a decent portion. You order a plate of lamb, you get a plate of lamb. (Unlike other hot pot places, where you order 10 plates, you only get ONE or none at all!) The meats were thinly sliced, and the lamb meat actually marbles! By far, the best lamb I've ever had in a hot pot setting. At this point, I'd say this restaurant deserves at least a 3-star.

Here comes the not-so-good part (This includes my 2nd review - December 2012).

- The open fridge and buffet bar get quite messy. All I can think in my mind was the cross-contamination. A lot of the items in the open fridge were frozen. Few hours down the road, everything would defrost. And so, items would be soaked in tubs of water, and water would drip into the containers below (**warning sign!**)

- Floors were WET... either they were from spills or because it was during winter time. I actually slipped and fell. I bruised my arm from knocking on the edge of the buffet table. The staff did not give a sh*t. Did not bother mopping the floor because they were too \"busy\". Did not even bother putting out a wet caution sign.

- It was extremely packed during winter time, like sardines packed. The ventilation was REALLY BAD... actually I don't even know if they have ventilation or if they are actually working. All I saw was fogs and smokes everywhere - this is ridiculous! 

So, let me conclude that you should ONLY come here on weeknights + definitely NOT during the winter. After the final review, I don't even think the restaurant deserves a 2-star... but I'll give it for the thinly sliced, marbled lamb."}
{"text":"This place becomes my favourite spot for hotpot AYCE. It has a nice atmosphere, quick service and the staffs are friendly. 

We're always here with group of 6 and we always have our own stove. I love their spicy broth. It's amazing! You can order 3 rounds for the ingredients you want to have with your hotpot (meat, vegetables, noodles,etc...) and they are all fresh. 

Like celebrity hotpot and other hotpot places, you can make your own dipping sauce. I always make mine with sesame sauce paste (look like peanut butter), soy sauce, a bit of garlic, a bit of vinerga, and chili oil. 

Some may not like the prune juice (they also have soy milk and water with lemon), but I think it goes well with the food. It won't make you feel full quick and feel heavy like soy milk. 

They didn't charge us for leftover but friendly remind us to not do it next time, which was very nice of them.

Their ice cream is good!! I love green tea flavour. Unfortunately, you can only order ice cream for one time. So make sure you order more than as many as you want for that one time! (the waitress told me that)

The price is reasonable for the amount of food and service. Hotpot is always my top choice during those cold winter days."}
{"text":"Waiter was super nice, but they need a better system, a lot of stuff was not brought out and they brought out too much of somethings that we only ask for a little of, very disorganized , it was very disappointing. There debit/credit machine was not working so that was a bummer as some of my friends didn't have cash so they were forced to use atm . Overall it was a good experience, but they def need some tweaking to improve"}
{"text":"A great place to have really spicy hotpot on warden close to the highway. If you like variety and lamb, this is a great place to go in the area. They have personal pots or big share pots. You have to pay extra for the level of spicy soup you want so price isnt any different than other hotpot places for ayce. Main thing i like about this place is that they have your vegetables and meats displayed nicely for you to pick yourself because sometimes you dont know what your veges are when you're checking it off the paper"}
{"text":"it was good, a bit pricey for what it was, but thats what you get with evening ayce. Not bad for groups if you're feeling hot pot"}
{"text":"Little Sheep Hot Pot is alright if you have had prior Chinese hot pot experience. I find the pricing not too bad for an AYCE hot pot place.

Stick with sliced lamb and beef for meats and you'll do just fine. The seafood, though obviously not top quality, is good for an AYCE place. There are some decent veggies, and I'll suggest having some near the end of the meal. Forget the fried buns at the top of the sauce station - filling up on carbs at an AYCE place is for amateurs ;)

The place does get busy on weekends / winter-time, and so there might be a wait for the sliced meats to come out. Just enjoy the experience and don't rush it.

Don't wear anything fancy to this place (it can get messy), and don't wear any clothing you can't put into the washer, and don't plan on going out for partying/dates - you'll smell like boiled meat afterwards!"}
{"text":"If you have never been to a hot pot  before you should try this one!
Hotpot is the process of cooking your food in a hot boiling pot infront of you.

21.99 for all you can eat dinner
+ 3 to 5 dollars for broth
3 for small
5 for large
If you share a pot with someone just gwt the regular broth in large ..they will bring it out in 2 halves one half will be spicy.

Food is great!
Fresh! 
Comes out fast!
Servers are patient and explain how the restaurant works in fluent english
Situated in china town montreal
Pot heats up quickly
Cooking time is fast
Free pop/ice tea
Free veggie spring rolls and peaches/pineapple on the side
They stack the dishes beside your table which is nice so you have space at your table if you are sitting at a 2 seater small table.
They have noodles, tripe, veggies, potato, seafood, beef,lamb etc. I dont believe there was chicken which i am thankful for as chicken is risky if you do not cook it long enough.
They fill your pot with hot water if your broth steams itself out too much.
They accept cash debit and credit -pay at the bar when you are done.
I would recommend walking into china town vs driving.
Great experience!"}
{"text":"Love this hot pot spot! Lots of sauce varieties, choices of tables with individual or sharing pots, great selection of dishes to cook, nice quality of beef and lamb slices, strong flavour soup bases. I always left here satisfied and happy. This location is clean and spacious, though there is only one private room with a big round table, the rest of the tables seat only four, not ideal of big groups. Another note, you will leave here smelling like hot pot for days, so don't wear your favourite outfit. (Or do, if you're like me and love to reminisce about the delicious meal the day after. =P)"}
{"text":"Reservations:
- On weekends including Fridays, they don't take reservations
- We got there at 715pm on a chilly Friday night and waited approx. 35 minutes for 2 people - not too bad (since it's indoors, you aren't waiting outside)

Price:
- Cheaper than both Chine and Morals on a Friday
- For 2, it was $66 all in including tax and tip

Soup Bases:
- There is a normal soup base and a spicy soup base
- We opted for the half and half at $5
- Soup bases are an extra $2.50 to $5
- Less variety compared to other places but the simpler soup bases really brought out the flavour of the lamb

Food:
- Unlimited soy milk and plum juice which is nice
- A lot of things come in 3s (fish ball, tofu, mushroom) which means its more convenient with groups of 2 or 3
- Less variety than its competitors but more than enough to get your assortment in
- All the ordering is by paper (3 rounds) with the exception of the lamb and beef slices
- You have to request the meat from waiters directly so it's technically unlimited (during our visit, we found the waiters to be quite responsive to our requests for more meat which was a big plus) but I can imagine this getting annoying when it's extra busy

Seating:
- For groups of 5, the 5th person in the boothstyle seats sits on the end which is a little awkward; better to sit at regular tables if you're a bigger group
- Quite spacious inside and not too crowded

Service: 
- Pretty decent overall, they had enough staff to service the restaurant enough

Overall, if you're not picky on soup base and want a decent hotpot place, this is a good option."}
{"text":"My 1st time here. I have been to the Mississauga location twice in the  last few months.

I am torn as the quality is better in the downtown location. Plus they have some extra apps and drinks included in your AYCE dinner meal that the Mississauga location.

The only thing is the broth has MSG so I am bloated after. I may do this twice a year max."}
{"text":"It's cold outside, and I'm ridiculously starving! Running every AYCE place through my mental directory, I could not come up with a place to satisfy my deep hunger pains.

After minutes of brain power exhausted, it hit me. HOT POT! 

Arriving with a friend, the place was pretty empty. Perfect! More food for us! 

Each table has its own ceramic top, which you can control. Like a lot of AYCE, you basically pick and choose what you want from a piece of paper.

We ended up order 2 rounds of basically everything x3. A bit excessive I know, but that's the best part of coming here!

Good cuts of meat, fresh veggies, and quite a lot of seafood available as well. I do like the fact that they give you a few choices of fountain drinks to pour yourself as well. 

3 hours later and I'm still full! I'll be taking a hiatus from hot pot for a little while, but I'm sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Was pretty much the only non-asian couple there so I think they are catering more towards the asian crowd which is fine. 

Food was ok. You make it yourself in a soup bowl but the selections of what to put in there was not all that interesting. (at least from my perspective from a guy who does not like seafood.)

Staff was very very friendly and helpful regardless of my lacking skills. 

I would say if you like this sort of place and/or seafood and/or soup, you would really like this place."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located at a plaza on Warden Ave. and Finch Ave. E. There were lots of parking spaces out front. 

[SERVICE] - 2/5
Host and the first server who greeted us were good. However, when we ordered additional platters of meat, we asked 2-3 servers until we received them. We also had to remind another server twice for napkins. 

[DÉCOR] - 2/5 
The self-serve concept was kind of cool. There was a wall of veggies, meatballs, other miscellaneous items, and drink dispensers for soft drinks, soy milk, and plum juice. 

[QUALITY] - 2/5
Meats were average, quality of self-serve food was below average and kind of disappointing. Little Sheep Specialty Soup base was good, but I personally do not like how each person got their own small pot of soup. The server did not even ask if we wanted one pot to share, even though that was an option and we would have been okay with waiting for a table. 

[ORDER] - 1/5
- Weekend AYCE Dinner - $23.99 + $1.00 per person for small pot of Little Sheep Specialty Soup Base: Meats were average, self-serve food was not that impressive. The only good items were the beef balls, lamb balls, and veggies. Drinks were also disappointing because the plum juice was warm and soya milk ran out a few times so we had to wait for servers had to replenish the dispenser. 

[OVERALL] - 1/5
Overall, I would not recommend Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot because the quality of food was mostly below average, and there were too many hiccups with the service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night, as our first time at a Mongolian Hot Pot style restaurant. We both love a good soup, so it sounded like a great idea.

The staff were very helpful right from the start, given that we were total newbies when it came to the do's and don'ts. They walked us through the menu, how to order and where to mix our sauces. We only ordered 2 rounds, and that stuffed us right up. But our server did mention we could do as many as we wanted. 

We got the large regular pot and ordered most of the menu in terms of additions. Notable additions were the homemade meat/fish balls, dumplings and noodles. Plus, awesome veggies like taro, wood ear mushrooms and watercress. The only thing we did not like was the Mongolian squid, ordered from the extras menu. It wasn't to our taste, and seemed overpriced for what you got. 

It did seem a bit more expensive than I would usually go for, but I got a Groupon that saved us a little bit. 

Would I go back? Yes...
Just next time, I think we will go with 2 small pots instead."}
{"text":"this is the closest thing i have found to the hot pot i loved so much in Taiwan. and i have searched hi and lo. this place offers a choice of herbal broth, spicy broth, or a combo. husband & i wanted it all, so we got the combo. they set the pot on your table, fire up the electric range underneath, and offer you a plate of beef or lamb slices. herein lies my only real complaint - no vegetarian option available for the soup. we loosen up when we travel, preferring not to miss out on too much of the food culture when visiting a new destination, but it makes me sad that vegetarians are not be able to partake of this fantastic dining experience. if you can get past the both issue, the buffet has piles of fresh greens - spinachES, bok choyS - as well as tofuS, mushroomS, noodles, broccoli, gluten, veggies i could not identify, all wonderful. we spent an hour or so making and eating our lunch (WAY cheaper than dinner). others were eating when we got there and still going strong when we left. loved it & still haven't stopped raving about it."}
{"text":"This place is such a great place to go all out on some great hot pot. It also doesn't cost you over $40 for endless amounts of meat and seafood.

I love the expansive menu and selection and loved the service. For the lamb or beef slices, we simply could tell them the amount of platters to bring out instead of writing the amount of \"slices\" which I think is more efficient. 

The vegetables and various fish/meat balls were very fresh and I absolutely loved their mini buffet bar and bottomless drinks station. This place is fully loaded for the price they charge ($23.99 pp for weekend dinner), which I'll take anyday!"}
{"text":"sent in my order two times before i finally got my food, and when I did get it, it was terrible, everything was frozen (from fishballs to handmade pork balls). Bad ventilation too...clothes still stink lol. And I don't know what I ate but I started feeling like shit the day after... sore throat, headwche, body pains, I'm guessing from the shitty quality of the food they provided, did not seem sanitary at all.

I dont know this place has
such good ratings when celebrity hot pot down the street is so much better, fresher,
and more selection!"}
{"text":"Meeeeeeeeh.

I'll rate category by category:

Waiters:
Decent as their were only 2 of them and the place was half-filled.  But it would've been nice if they came by the table a little bit more often.

Food Bar:
Large selection for lunch - especially some items you wouldn't see at other places.
However, they filled the soy sauce pot with vinegar & definite turn off when you take it back to your table & you're ready to demolish everything in front of you.
& everything there turns luke-warm by the end of lunch.

Table:
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the concept of having your own pot.  Now you can find everything you dropped in there without fearing your family basically ate it all or that it's burning underneath everybody else's ingredients.  
The soup here is 10x better than anywhere else - they use herbs to make it (except their chain restaurant in Queens, NY has the best one - there's is not even slightly watered down).

Will be back 100x."}
{"text":"The good: oh sodium high, this place is where you can indulge in salt and be the meat eater that you are. I purchased a groupon and it was $12 for $20 worth of food for 2 people. 

I love how you can go up and get your own food. They have a buffet section where you can take your plate and choose as you wish, and however much you like at one cost! Includes drinks and desserts. You can also order unlimited lamb and beef dishes. 

The bad: although the buffet is great, it may not always be fresh, and it can be lacking in terms of the availability of food, but they do have the main staples (fish balls, spam, and veggies)"}
{"text":"We were a party of twelve, we came here and couldn't wait to eat because it smelled so delicious in this restaurant.  Unfortunately, the \"employees must wash hands\" rule is not taken seriously at the restaurant.  My nephew came out of the men's bathroom and said he witnessed our server not washing his hands after using the bathroom and blowing nose and scratching his eyes., so we left immediately. Yeah.... No thanks!"}
{"text":"Was craving hot pot and this was the closest place. We went on a weekend so it was $22.99 per person & additionally you have to pay for the soup base. We got large ying yang pot $5, half clear soup and half spicy soup. We preferred the clear soup, the spicy one was too spicy and we didn't like the flavour either. All the meats and veggies were typical nothing special. Service was okay, they forget some of our items and we have to remind them a few times."}
{"text":"$22.90 per person, weekday price
There are only 2 soup bases here, either regular or spicy. I think you have to add more money if you want mixed soup bases, but I wouldn't know since there's no menu. Weird huh? When we came in they asked what soup base and then says us down and the meal began, there was no menu. I do like the idea how it was self serve - you have a plate and go up to the back to grab all the ingredients you want so there is a portion control. There is a great variety of food, including seafood like shrimp, mussel, fish, and variety of fish balls. One thing I didn't like was when you first sit down they give you 3 plates, a plate of beef, lamb and pork which was good quality, but when you ask for more, the qualkty of the second round of meat isn't as good."}
{"text":"For the one place that doesn't use Pork base soup, it's pretty good. 

I don't eat pork, so looking for a hot pot place isn't easy. This is the one place I know of in Mississauga that uses chicken broth. 

We went last night for dinner and it wasn't 'AMAZING' but it wasn't bad. If you haven't gone for hot pot before it takes some getting used to. 

Learning what a good mix for a dipping sauce and when to put what in the pot can be confusing when you have no experience cooking. Haha but the experience was fun!

I probably wouldn't go back alone, but in a group setting it's a great place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this hot pot. Ate like 6 plates of lamb with the spicy soup and seafood soup. Service was actually excellent! No complaints."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for Mongolian Hot Pot for $20 off for minimum of 2 adults. I came with my kids and didn't see that fine print and was charged one of the kids as an adult price which I didn't find it fair but it was my fault for not reading the fine print. I came on a day when it was -39 degrees Celsius so perfect day for hot pot. little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot was located in a plaza in Mississauga. It's a huge restaurant where maybe only a quarter of the place was filled.  But for some reason there's a huge line up. Not sure if they're doing it on purpose. We got seated and I asked for a clear
Broth since my girls are picky with broth but it came with a creamy chicken broth and had these weird preserved stuff in it. The food didn't look too fresh. I lived Scarborough before and that's where you'll find the best hot pot places. I was not happy with the quality of the food. I would only give this place a 2 star. With $20 off our bill still came over $70 with tax and tip. Very pricy for 1 adult and 2 kids for mediocre hot pot.  Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Best thing ever in a cold city! We pigged out like there was no tomorrow. The service was excellent and the ingredient was as fresh as possible. I am coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"6/25/15: Wow... now here's a hot pot that is sure to separate the hot pot PROS from the WANNABE's!!!  It's AYCE, and who doesn't love AYCE?  They even got that island with the sauces and various side dishes.  ......... and it's HORRIBLE!!!  I mean holy crap it's bad.  Absolutely frightening how bad those side dishes are!  And that is totally a good thing... as the weak will be shed, and some will even run away... and for those that do stay, but not bring a linguistic guardian capable of dealing with the stubborn Chinese tongues, heed thy warning...

...but for those that remain... The careful well-honed sense of true hot pot aficionados, developed over hundreds of meals gathered around boiling pots with family and drunken friends, that sense will guide those so gifted to the ultimate prize:  Their Menu.

And spy thy treasure....... glorious creatures of the sea, authentic Chinese specialties rarely found this side of the world, and in particular one creature so rare, so delectable... giving its precious lives to you.  For that one morsel so cute and so adorable, for it is worth a trip of great distances!  Yes, hot pot lover, pick those crazy rare items and as your table becomes a sauna, rejoice!  Rejoice!

Everything is delicious, but let me entice you with these....

1. Handmade Pork/Beef/Fish/Shrimp/Lamb Ball:  Yes they are indeed hand made, probably by underpaid and sweaty workers hating life in the back, but expertly.  Definitely exceeds any Ranch 99 (or whatever the equivalent is in Canada) purchased factory-made balls you might have had.  Truly special.

2. Thick Rice Noodles:  I have NEVER had this before, ever.  My gf's eyes lit up though when she saw this on the menu.  They're 1\" wide noodles, and pretty thick too.  Transparent when cooked.  The texture is very chewy (for noodles), what Chinese call \"qq.\"  For those that have had the authentic liang pi, it's kinda like that but wider.  Awesome, and must get!

...and the Golden Chalice...

3. Cuttlefish:  Best hot pot seafood item ever.  I have never seen this at any other hot pot in America before, or anywhere else for that matter, China included.  Ain't cheap stuff.  Eat your top-of-food-chain heart out.  So cute, so amazing.

Are you a pro?  Test yourself.

{"text":"This is my 4th time here and I guess it is time that I write a review to this place.  The food is amazing.  If you haven't been to hotpot before I definitely recommend it.  It's basically like korean bbq where you cook your own food but instead of a grill it's a large pot of broth.  Whatever you order, you basically just put everything in the pot of broth and just wait for it to cook.

The only complaint I have here is that some servers who are serving you do not speak any English or very little and can be very troublesome for those who are dining at the restaurant. Also, asked one of the servers for more water and napkins but had to ask them numerous times as it would take too long or they would just simply forget.  The 4 times I've visited here I noticed you have to ask the servers multiple times until you get what you need which can be very annoying.  One of the waiters didn't even understand the word napkin and looked very confused when we were asking him if we could get more.  We ended up having to point to the table next to us what we wanted.

The food is great, restaurant is nice, and the service could use more work."}
{"text":"The little sheep's soup base taste are basically the same compared to those in China. Ordered mix soup base for two people. My boyfriend don't eat spicy food while I love spicy. The spicy soup base is not really spicy for me, but their customized sauce is fabulous! I like the chill oil mixed with sesame oil, garlic sauce, and a little bit vinegar. FYI their ice cream are great, personally I prefer green tea ice cream. Servers are quite busy but they are able to answer our questions on time."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best hot pot places in the downtown Toronto area; it's in fact its best franchise location. The place was spacious with its stove functioning correctly and efficiently, I never had any problem with waiting for the soup to boil (it was that fast!). The selection of toppings for the hot pot was amazing, great variety. And the lamb here is definitely its best. This was ordered in the style of an All you can eat restaurant where you marked what you want on to a piece of paper and it gets send to the kitchen. My orders came fast, though when it is busy (I am a multi-time customer), the staffs are quite aggressive in terms of shoving you the plate of raw food. However, that is easily forgotten with the delicious smelling pot of steaming goodness boiling in front of you. 

In my opinion, it is quite pricey for the service that you are getting; sometime, the staffs would be super nice and friendly, other times they are plain rude. They really need to strict up on their hiring skills. Regardless, I would definitely recommend this place if you are down for a nice clean ravishing hot pot restaurant."}
{"text":"Before anything else, if you decide to come here, either 1) wear clothes you won't miss or 2) Prepare to go nowhere else after, and just go home to do laundry.

Oh, yeah, and leave your jacket in your car. And good luck with that fancy purse, ladies.

Now that I got that off my chest, I can't believe I wasn't here sooner! I came here at 6pm, relatively early in my books, but there's already a line out the door. We sat down not too long later, thanks to reservations, and I proceeded to get educated in this new hotpot environment. First, I chose my soup base a little wrong - I should have said SLIGHTLY spicy. I said \"moderate\" and it came with about 50 of those peppers floating around. I scrambled to pull them out, leaving my soup spicy, but not deathly spicy.

Then the food area. You have to bring your own plate and cup from your table to that area to fill up with food. There are fountains for the drinks, including soft drinks, soy milk and plum juice. The food itself is plentiful, TONS of raw options to choose from. The dessert island was ok, but the best of it were the white \"man tou\"s, or buns, that gets dipped in the condensed milk while it's hot. mmMMM....we had to wait for servers to refill those.

Only one thing to remember, aside from the clothes thing. Walk carefully. Those floors are SLIPPERY in certain areas!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept, you arrive and if it's your first time you have to ask what to do.  Our server assumed we all knew what we were doing.  Since it was our first time we had to pry the information out of him like we were pulling teeth.  Midway through dinner we discovered there was a spice and sauce bar where you help yourself.  Thanks for letting us know!

The food was quite bland.  With just raw meats meats and vegetables at your disposal there isn't really much to the taste.  The experience was interesting though.

The hot broth had these odd peppercorns that tasted terrible (bitter and sour at the same time).  If I were to go again I'd opt for the regular broth and just add my own spices."}
{"text":"Being one of the larger chains of hot pot restaurants. Their trademark spice broth and lamb meat offerings were good, the beef at first serving was great, the second plate was not of the same quality. There are many other offerings from fish balls, noodles and vegi options to cook your own and there is the serve yourself drink bar ( pop and plum tea/ soy drink)"}
{"text":"This Mongolian hot pot place in Chinatown is really not good, the food is not so fresh and the smell of the hot pot will stick on your clothes and never go away. I find the choices of meat and vegetable quite limited compared to the one in south shore, and plus this restaurant is just too small to be set up as a hot pot restaurant, it's simply suffocating, to avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"1. I love ???? 
2. This place is not one of the \"good ones\"
3. However this is as good as it can get in town

For under 20$ you get unlimited veggies, proteins and noodles with snacks, broth... condiments and little desserts! Enjoy some time with friends and at the end of the day, it's all that matters. The atmosphere is warm and a bit family-style but in the meantime you won't feel pushed at all."}
{"text":"Well, the wait is over! Mississauga finally has a hot pot place to call our own. I came here on a weekday, when the price drops by $1/person to $21.99/person. Broth ranges from an additional $1-5 depending on which one you choose. There is a sauce corner in which you can build your own sauce. Although the beef was sliced very thinly and was a little corse, the rest of the meat and vegetables were very fresh. Service was average, it took some time to get top ups of water and broth. All in all, it was a good experience and I'll be back. Now that there is some great hot pot in my back yard!"}
{"text":"It's more affordable compared to other AYCE hotpot. I came on a Friday night, the price was $23.99, and + $1.50 to get a spicy broth (half regular, half spicy). I enjoyed everything from foods to service. I like the broth so much, especially the spicy one. It is actually quite spicy. 
The sauce bar is interesting as they have a variety of options, from bean curd paste to sesame paste. The bean curd paste was really good besides the regular sauce I usually make. 
The meat is quite good, there are lamb and beef slices that I find the lamb slice was a little better than beef slices. 
The topping includes a variety of meatball from beef and seafood. I tried them all and they are actually not that good, to be honest. I rather just order meat. Besides meatball, there are vegetables, and mussel, shrimp, HK-styled sausage, beef tendon, etc... all things that a regular hotpot place should have. 
There is also dessert section placed on the side of the topping bar. Unfortunately there is only two types of cakes served. The coconut one was quite good. 
Beverages are also included, including pops. There was no iced tea at the time I went, however. 

Overal, this is actually my favorite hotpot place for the price and taste. I gave 4 stars for my first-time visit. I would recommend and come back to this place again, and rate 5-star is everything stays consistent with what I received on the first time."}

Un beau samedi frisquet et humide, quel meilleur moment pour se échauffer avec une grande marmitte de fondue mongolienne. Un classique de la cuisine asiatique, avec un choix de légumes, de viandes et d'arômates. L'endroit est très bien éclairé, parfaitement adapté aux groupes comme aux couples discrets. On vous demande tout d'abord quel choix de bouillon vous désirez. Je choisi un bouillon nourrissant aux herbes. Puis, les viandes. Je choisis, porc, boeuf et poulet. On vous apporte la marmitte (en petit format ou en grand format, selon votre apétit) qu'on dépose sur une plaque chauffante centrale, encastrée dans la table. Vous faites vous-même votre propre cuisine en déposant dans le bouillon ce qu'il vous plaît. Laissez dégeler les viandes lentement en laissant l'assiette près de la plaque chauffante, ce sera ainsi plus facile. Vous n'avez que pour seul outil, des baguettes. Si vous manipulez les viandes crues, vous pouvez ensuite stériliser rapidement les baguette dans le bouillon. Vous contrôlez la température de chauffe du bouillon, au goût. Pour finir, vous pouvez demander de filtrer la fondue et terminer le tout dans un grand bol comme une soupe. Vous y ajoutez ensuite ce que vous voulez car vous avez accès à un grand buffet de condiments et divers produits de la mer, crevettes entières, boules de poisson. Afin de bien contrôler la température du bouillon, vous pouvez ajouter des légumes croustillants comme le Bok Choy. Malheureusement, vous n'avez pas de take out pour vos restants. J'aurais aimer rapporter ma soupe avec moi et l'aggrémenter chez moi.

A nice and wet saturday, what better time to get your heater back on with a mongolian hot pot. An asian classic with vegetables, meats and aromatic herbs. The place is well lighted, perfectly adapted to groups or cosy couples. You chose your hot pot stock. I picked a nice nutricious herbs stock. Then the meat cuts, beef, pork, chicken. The hot pot is brought to you and put on a heating plate installed inside the table center. You have two sizes of hot pot. It's better if you leave the frozen meat plate near the hot plate so it can thaw easily. Your only tools are chopsticks. You can sterilise them in the hot stock once you've touched raw meat, if you want. At last, you can ask to filter down the stock and finish it as a soup. If you want to control the temperature of you hot pot, you can use raw Bok Choy. You have access to a variety of condiments, sea food and sauces. Unfortunately, you cannot bring home your leftovers. I would've liked it."}
{"text":"On two different occasions I came to this location for hot pot. The first was years ago and it was bad. I'm talking about warm ingredients, thousands of flies bad. My friend got sick right when we left the place. We swore never to go again. But I did, some 4+ years later.

The second time around, it was nice to see that they upped their game. The ingredients were fresher, probably one fly in the whole place. The drink machine was still disgusting though. It sprayed everywhere because they can't get the pressure right. The food itself wasn't bad but the service was shit. I mean, how do you mess up service for a buffet style dinner? The ladies that go around pouring the broth were nice but some of the staff were real jerks.

We called for the bill to pay and it came. We called for the machine to pay by credit card and one of the servers left. As we were waiting, another server (probably the host) rudely tells us that the time limit was up and we had to go. Did he not see that we all had our bills in our hands? I told him that we're waiting for the machine and already sent someone to get it. He responded by telling us that our time limit was up and to hurry up and get out as there are reservations. I had to tell him again that we're waiting to pay."}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch is around 15 dollars per person.
Lamp slice, beef slice, and al kinds of mushrooms, vegetables, taros, toufu...so fresh and yummy!!!!
I love the MAQIU (Golden fried sweet balls with sesame on top)
Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I don't come here for service, I come here for the food. For hotpot in Calgary, it doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of little sheep in Scarborough . It is fantasy every time is went there. For little sheep downtown, I went there around 1800 and have to wait for 45 mins. The waitress speak Chinese all the time and call out the number in Chinese, which is really annoy coz we can't understand if she call our number. The soup are fantastic same like little sheep in Scarborough. I recommend the free soup , it will taste a little bit spicy and salt. For the spicy soup, too much oil and too spicy for me. There are no buffet line , you have to order in the paper and they will bring it to you. For who doenst eat beef and lamp, there is no pork slice . The beef and lamb is great but chicken is terrible. The texture is soft and no taste. If your order doesn't come, make sure they didn't forget. They always forget 20%of my orders in every round that I ordered. The atmosphere is clumsy . May  be because they are just opened and everything is not fully ready. This place is not fascinated for me. If I will have a little sheep hot pot again. Driving to Scarborough is preferable."}
{"text":"First time visit at the Little Sheep was great.  We first complained about the strong smell that hits you when you come inside the restaurant. At first it smelled like some sort of chemical, but we found out that they were the chilis in the spicy broth.

We were seated right away and since it was our first time out server explained how the ordering is done, which was nice. We ended up order 3 or their lunch set hotpots  which our server recommended plus a few extra kabobs. 

The food came quickly and everything tasted great! We really loved the half non spicy and half spicy broth, it definitely gave the soup a more complex flavour.

Our only complaint was that our server never came back to check on us once after she brought the hotpot. Our tea, juices, and water were not filled until the very end when she we asked for the bill.

So, I definitely recommend Little Sheep for super tasty hotpot!"}
{"text":"free parking. access to public transportation. I didn't notice bike wracks but the restaurant is located in a plaza I'm sure there's bike wracks near the restaurant.
if you're looking for an authentic Mongolian restaurant this is definitely a great place to go. If this is your first time... there's a lot of rules to know. So basically when you first walk in there's no hostest so you can walk up to the counter and ask the staff for a table. Then you pick the raw food from the green columns and red (menu) choose from meat, seafood, noodles, tofu, vegetables.. the broth pot will come in a few minutes after sitting down. you can choose from spicy broth to regular or half and half.
 once the raw food comes out you can cook it while that's cooking in the hot pot there's a table with sauces you can also have on the side and dunk your cooked meat in.
the staff doesn't explain jack to you nor are they fluent in English. I hope this helps first timers!
 This is a buffet style restaurant please don't waste food order what you can eat and they bring it to you. dinner for four was 130.00$ bucks for me. no alcoholic beverages"}
{"text":"Will try to keep things simple. Not trying to be racist. This is my overall experience in here.
- Problem understanding/speak English.
- Not enough tongs so whoever one who is allergic to something can react since people use mostly the same Tongs on different food genre. 
- Raw food is near cooked food. 
- Called waiter for lamb but told me its being cut. Another asian called the waiter and talk in their language, Lamb came out so I tried calling again but ended up ignoring me and went for another same language when I definitely got their nod attention. They kept doing this till I was the last one who needed to order for a lamb.
-Asked for soup broth, they keep pouring till its full when we told them it's enough. 
- Took the plate we use to remove shrimp tails or things we dont want in our food when they see us using it. They should have asked first instead of snatching it away. Would have ask for another plate but its a hassle because of their service.
-Horrible service that I tipped a little(better no tip) instead of the average but the cashier demanded more. Which we are not obligated to tip especially if we have a bad experience. 
- We will never go back and not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Service is good. Meat is great. Soup is A1. Price is average for hot pot. Ive been to the one in Vancouver as well and they're both good. Sometimes there's a Groupon coupon you can look for."}
{"text":"This is one of the few hot pot places in Mississauga. It's alright. They have a good selection of meats and veggies you can put in. I wasn't a fan of the garlic beef, seaweed and meatballs though. Those 3 particularly weren't done very well.  There are two types of broth and as others have mentioned already, the spicy is very spicy. I asked for less chilies but I doubt the waiter did anything. This brings me to my next point. The waiter only brought us garlic beef when we ordered pork belly, beef, garlic beef and lamb during our first round. We attempted to order the missing platters again during the second round and again we only got yet another platter of garlic beef (which I thought wasn't very good). We ended up bugging multiple waiters to get our order right and finally one out of the three waiters finally brought us the right meat dishes. Still not sure why they kept messing up the orders."}
{"text":"Well this was disappointing. My boyfriend and I decided to make the trek from the SE to check out this much raved about hot pot restaurant but waited over 20 minutes to get a server before we left.

The couple beside us was also concerned with waiting on their order unfortunately.

Hopefully they hire more servers down the road."}
{"text":"Little sheep est conçu pour les fanatiques de fondues. Chaque table est muni d'une plaque chauffante sur laquelle vous faites mijoter les aliments de votre choix, dans le bouillon de votre choix. C'est un all you can eat donc, vous pouvez recommander autant de fois que vous le souhaitez. Les boissons gazeuses sont à volonté elle aussi. Ce n'est peut-être pas les aliments des plus frais, mais il faut se souvenir que c'est un buffet à environ 20$ par personne! C'est un bon rapport qualité prix. Le service est convenable. L'endroit est propre, spacieux et le décor est plutôt moderne. Prévoyez sentir après... l'odeur des épices restent imprégnée dans les vêtements! C'est  un restaurant à essayer, du moins pour l'expérience!"}
{"text":"Good selection and the broth is amazinggggg *O*
I personally don't think the dinner price is worth it since it is pricier, but it does include seafood and dessert. If you're more into the meat and noodles like me, go for the lunch menu--your wallets will thank you. Overall I still find the food delicious and would definitely go back here again! (: yumyum"}
{"text":"This is a lil pricey..even with a groupon.
It was a nice outing.. reminded me of bbq in cambodia where u cook the raw foods yourself in this big pot of water.

i'll be back when someone else is paying."}
{"text":"I love this place or maybe I just love hotpot. It's all you can eat and have a wide range of meat and veggies to choose from.

Taste way better during the winter season when u want something hot to eat. Might need reservations.

my favorite is the lamb and seafood meat which is tasty.  you can get other broths for a small charge."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a decently sized restaurant on a corner in Chinatown on the second floor. As soon as you walk in, your nose will be overwhelmed with the amazing smells of their hotpot broth. Be warned though: your clothes WILL smell like hotpot when you leave! 

FOOD: Delicious and fresh. I love their lamb. Also, their menu has a LOT of variety which is really cool. For a buffet style restaurant, I'm really impressed with their portions, quality and variety. I would definitely recommend this spot, especially in the winter time. It warms you up and fills you up!

PRICE: Nice price for the amount of food that you can eat, the variety and the quality. 

SERVICE: Pretty good service. It's a busy restaurant so it's a little bit hard to flag a waiter down."}
{"text":"What to try?

Of course their hot pot!!

It's an all you can hot pot galour! First you choose your soup base and then you pick the food items you want to cook. DIY everyone! 

I thought the soup bases were great and I especially liked it when I get to taste two different broths in one pot. The pot is split in half therefore we get to try two soups. I liked how they served the food items too. They wouldn't give you a whole lot but just enough for a taste. If you liked it, you can order more but it allows you to go crazy and order as many items on the menu but you wouldn't be getting a lot so you're just getting a taste of the items. That way, if you liked it you can order more; it also helps the environment and the restaurant from wasting food. The only limitation for little sheep is its selection. In comparison to its competitor hot pot restaurant, I don't think there's enough variety for the customers to choose from. Maybe that's why it's cheaper in comparison to the other competitor restaurants? 

Last tip?

You can save a bit of money by buying the Groupon and save 40% off of a meal for two or four. Not shabby at all when you can save some money on your meal!!"}
{"text":"While the food was good, as well as the service, I am giving this place a two star review because of the lasting impression we were given by the cashier guy. 
My man left a tip on the table, and when we went up to pay, the cashier blatantly said \"you have to tip minimum 10%\" 
A) go check the table before making wild accusations 
B) we don't HAVE to tip... don't make customers feel like they did something illegal if they choose not to tip."}
{"text":"Food was good. Soup was really spicy, definitely going to try the mild soup next time. The meats and seafood tasted great. Everything was nice and fresh. Only downfall is that the service wasn't the best but understanding it's a new restaurant when you visit will help you enjoy it more. The staff do try to help you as much as possible, I think service will improve over time. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night and was seated within 10 minutes. They have pretty fast service and a good selection of food. I really like their fish balls and meat balls."}
{"text":"I was referred to this Hotpot place.  This chain is also in the US, San Francisco.  

This is your typical AYCE.  There is only two different broths:  spicy and regular or you can get both in a divided individual pot.  The broth was a tad too salty for me.  They only replenished with a plain broth and it didn't help the saltiness.  The spicy was nice, but I like spicy.  The food is unlimited like all AYCE.  The selection is ok, I have been to a few others that had more selection.  The drink bar was nice, I love soy milk and that won me for sure.  It is a decent place.  The beef and lamb was really good."}
{"text":"had some mongolian hot pot on a summer night, not sure if that was smart but we were all craving some. the selection is pretty good, and standard. they put it all in the fridge and you basically go and grab whatever. the quail eggs were tasty, so were the turnips. we were in the separate chamber since we had a large group and i preferred that anyway because its more private and the noise level can be controlled. the meats arrived promptly by the waiters and the service was decent. a good hot pot place to try."}
{"text":"This was the first hot pot place I've been to where you can manage your own pot! I thought that was great. The ordering was simple though they did forget some items we ordered (doesn't bother me enough to take off a star). 

They also had a variety of self-serve dishes. My friends really liked the fried mantou (though she asked what it was and the server said \"bread,\" was quite funny). The other cold dishes are good too though. The soy milk is super sweet--just how I like it, and the plum juice was good too (just not my preferred drink). The water tank, somewhat hilariously, had a whole, uncut lemon floating in it. Couldn't taste the lemon. 

On another note, two of my friends got \"half-spicy\" soup base and when asked to contribute to my review, they said \"half spicy is too spicy, maybe 1/3rd?\" so take that as you will. One of my friends removed the peppers from her half-spicy soup and there were quite a lot (see image attached)."}
{"text":"Craving spicy asian food Yelp recommended this restaurant. It was my first time eating hot pot. 

The server was helpful explaining how it works. There is an electric 
stove top burner built into the table to heat up your broth. You select a single serving or large pot to share with others. In either size you can have one or 
1/2 and 1/2 soup bases of the hot chillies or chicken flavor w/ginger, garlic and lemon grass. I chose 1/2 of each broth which was good but next time will opt for just the spicy. 

After choosing your broth(s) you can then go to the buffet to select your vegetables, pasta, seafood and meats to cook in your hot pot. The server also brings over a plate of raw, thin sliced beef and lamb for you to cook in your pot.There is a separate table of ingreidents for you to concoct different sauces to accompany your food. 

You can eat as much as you like, desserts and drinks are included in the price ($$).  

The concept is similar to mongolian barbeque. It is a great place for a romantic date where you can relax, take your time cooking and sharing a hot pot with someone special  :)"}
{"text":"Nice spot for hot pot!  We had an early dinner and it was open at 4:30 p.m.  Dinner price was $21.95/person AYCE.  The menu was pretty extensive.  We ordered our soup base first which was an added cost of $5.00 - plain broth.  Then, we ticked off items like beef, lamb, pork, meat balls, fish balls, prawn balls, pork liver, loads of prawns, fish, tofu, vege, enoki mushrooms, mushrooms, black fungus, mussels, cuttlefish, tendon and rice.  A huge pot of aromatic Chinese herbal cloudy soup arrived.  Everything was great!  Soup was delicious.  We had to go pick our own sauces.  Nice selection of different types of sauces.  

We'd come back again, for sure."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I've had hot pot at this location and I can't believe how much things have changed... And not for the better.

The number of appetizer dishes have decreased dramatically and the only thing that even slightly interested me were the steamed buns which ended up being dry and hard. For some reason I remember there being jellyfish in the mix previously.

I love having plum juice at hotpot but the juice here is so watered down it tastes like water.

Finally, the dessert options are so limited and pathetic (canned peaches, shrimp crackers, some sad looking pastries) that I didn't even bother getting any. What happened to the icecream options?

The one good thing this place has going for it is that each person gets their own individual pot so you don't need to worry about sharing. There are also a good variety of seafood options in addition to unlimited beef and lamb slices.

Price-wise, it is $22.99 per person for AYCE but given the quality and limited food options... and the fact that your hair and clothes will STINK after eating here, I won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Great food!

Warning: Don't have too much of the spicy hot pot... it's really spicy and addicting and can cause serious ... damage. 

The food is fresh and delicious. I went during Christmas and random carolers came in and sang wonderful carols. Tip to owner: hire kids to sing carols? 

It's a great place for groups. When you go, they will ask: \"small or big pot\". Get them to show you the difference -- but essentially, the small pot gives you your own 2 flavour hot pot, whereas the big gives you a two flavour hot pot to share with the person sitting in front of you. My advice: Take whichever table is free. 

Very similar to iCook, but I would say that this place is smaller and doesn't have as many soups to choose from."}
{"text":"Food was good.  a bit of a small selection of ingredients (ranged from different noodles, vegetables). But not much of a meat selection and the desert was one choice at a time. we saw eclairs. But the reason i gave a 3/5 is the price. The bill came roughly 30 dollars a person. for what was there, this was definitely not worth."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I've been to more Little Sheep locations than most. China (Beijing, Guangzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai), Hong Kong, LA, NJ (Edison), and NYC (Flushing). While this location isn't the best I've ever had, it also isn't the worst. Service is good, but since it's all you can eat, a little self help will go a long way, like grabbing the paper menu by the front desk after you're done with the first round and mark selections for your second round order and give the marked paper menu to a waiter. The beef is not that great, but the lamb was outstanding. I would highly suggest trying the Sichuan kimchi (pickled cabbage): whomever made it knows what it's all about and I had two plates. Bit of advice: steer clear of the soft drinks and desserts until you're full, otherwise it's easy to stuff yourself with sodas and pastries. The fourth star is for the smiling service from the front desk staff and the observant waitstaff."}
{"text":"Christmas Day dinner is reservation only, and I found out only after arriving and speaking with a cold faced woman and looking at a mostly empty restaurant. It was 7:30pm, height of the dinner time, yet they had no more than three tables filled. 

I had called earlier in the day to ensure they're open, the person answering the phone said they were open until 10pm but never said I needed reservation. So, in essence the people answering the phone had zero interest in how the customer might be treated once they arrive. 

It would be funny if none of the people who made reservation showed up, but alas I'm the one having the last laugh as I sat down in the Chinatown Little Sheep 20 minutes later. Try the Chinatown location instead, you'll find all you can eat food and a much better wait staff."}
{"text":"I love hot pot so naturally coming here on a really cold evening was the best idea I've had all week. We came around dinner time and was prepared for the 15 mins wait. Though if you come in pairs the wait is slightly shorter. 

I was impressed by the large selection of food and what's better is that it's all you can eat. Quality wasn't bad, the shrimps were very fresh, plenty of veggies to fulfill my herbivore needs. The lack of dessert was disappointing but by the end of our meal, we were too full to care. 

There's a pop dispenser for all your carbonated drink needs. Plates of beef and lamb are ordered via the call of the waiters and waitresses. Total came to be $27 per person after excluding tips. We came on Sunday. It's a dollar off from Monday to Thursday though and I reckon the wait to be shorter during the earlier weekdays.

Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday around 2pm so it was super empty. My friend ran a little late so I was seated first and right off the bat I was pushed to order. I don't even know if it's because they wanted us out faster than we came in or..

My friend came and we finally ordered the AYCE lunch. Our waiter asked if we'd like to get the dinner instead since it had the seafood option, which neither of us were entirely excited about seeing as we could live without it, so we declined. Turns out the red section on the menu got crossed out, meaning we don't get anything on the red side at all. Which was stupid because I really wanted the enoki mushrooms. Who would pay $5 more just for enoki mushrooms?? 

Anyway, I've been to the same establishment in Scarborough and found the difference extraordinary. They do not have split menus and everything was self-serve, including the enoki mushrooms and shrimp and every other seafood listed on this menu. This location had slightly more selection but you gotta pay extra for them and on top of what you're already paying for oysters, etc. so personally not worth it.

Since the entire floor was empty save for one or two groups, we had super quick service. As soon as we finished our plates of meat, the waiter would bring a fresh batch from the back. It was not difficult at all to catch their attention. Service was friendly overall, no qualms about it. 

I'd suggest coming in on an early weekday to save the hassle of bad service and missed food."}
{"text":"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is a pretty interesting restaurant that offers almost all you can eat.  I said almost  because it allows you to go through 3 rounds of food selections for your hot pot.  And for dessert, it's only 1 round.  Mind you, each plate of meat and vegetables contains a generous portion to be had.  There were lots of food to choose from - seafood, lamb, beef etc, and lots of different veggies.  Also there was a choice of spicy or non spicy soup base.  I had the non spicy soup base, and it was nice. 
The service was good.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  They were pretty good about clearing up the empty plates that piled up.  
Price was pretty high per person at about $30-ish.  Best to get a groupon."}
{"text":"Came here using the latest Groupon deal, in a party of three. My family is from Hong Kong, so hotpot during the winter is comfort food for us. We have it at home (or at friends' homes) often during this season.

We've had various hotpot experiences dining out, including other Little Sheep locations, and lower & higher quality restaurants too. This particular Little Sheep location falls somewhere in middle of the pack.

If it's your FIRST time hotpotting - go with an open mind! It's going to be very different from anything you've had AND everyone does it a little differently. :P  Just make sure you mix a good sauce.  Again, everyone does it a little differently - but I highly recommend using the one labelled \"satay\"... it's a classic!

ATMOSPHERE:  Slick, clean and bright interior. Average noise level. Good spacing between tables.  We were there for an early weeknight dinner buffet.  So the restaurant wasn't busy when we first arrived. And it being a Monday, it didn't get to full capacity at typical dinner time. There were other patrons - but it wasn't packed.  This probably contributed to the better (read: quieter and less rushed vibe) atmosphere than on a Friday or weekend evening.

I like that there is an option to choose a shared large pot, or individual small pots. (Induction stove-top is built into the tables - so they'll seat you in a different section according to your table/pot choice)

SERVICE:  Surprisingly good. I know others have commented on this, but yes, I was still shocking to experience good service. :P All our liquids were topped up regularly (soy milk, plum juice, and soup for the pot). Sauce Station was always stocked in all options as well.  Would be better if there were more sauce stations - I only saw one for the whole restaurant.  On a busy night, it would cause quite a queue...  But otherwise, service was great. Always many servers available to answer your call, and very patient to explain how everything worked for first-time visitors.  Most staff speak Mandarin and English fluently, and a few speak Cantonese as well.

PRICE:  $21.99 per person (extra $1 on weekend & holidays) for our weeknight meal. Drinks are extra.  Free refills on plum juice and soy milk only.  Broth is extra, ranging from $2.50 to 5. Sauces included.

We had a Groupon, which helped. Overall, average cost for such a location, food and service. (Of course comparing to doing it at home - this will seem much more costly! But dining out for hotpot, this is average. And also: NO PREP or CLEAN UP. For those who have hotpot at home - lots of prep & clean up is involved)

FOOD:  In general, we enjoyed everything we ordered.  First came the free side dishes: 2 cold veggie dishes and a plate of hot pork bone (similar to what you find in Korean pork bone soup).  That was unexpected (and filling).

Greens and veggies were good quality. We ordered multiple portions of watercress and various mushrooms. 

For carbs, I recommend the hand-pulled/made noodles (wide and flat; chewier in texture), and the spinach noodles (much thinner; texture is similar to soba).  

The sliced meats were great. We tried the beef, lamb and pork belly.  Liked the quail eggs. Most of the seafood we tried were great! Especially the shrimp and mussels. Squid/calamari was a bit small, but texture and flavour was good. Skip the fish. It was very mushy and kind of fell apart as you pick it up to eat, and not much flavour at all.

I would pass on the meat/fish balls. I prefer denser/chewier variety... there's was very soft and mushy.

Wontons were good - the filling inside was very fresh. My piece had a whole shrimp in it that was pretty good quality. I usually don't eat wonton/dumplings in my hot pot (it's considered a filler in my house) but these were so good we were glad we got them!

***
Generally, I'm a fan of dining at home for hotpot, where you can customize and have exactly what you like.  BUT if I wanted to introduce someone who's new to this cuisine, I would bring them here for their first experience. - it's not too pretentious an atmosphere, and still has good food options."}
{"text":"This was my first hotspot experience and I loved it!   Very spacious and inviting venue, service was great as was the food.  We tried a bit of everything and our favourite meat was the pork.    Veggie wise, sweet potato and broccoli were big hits in our group."}
{"text":"One of the staple hot pot restaurants uptown, and a decent place to enjoy a warm balanced meal or stuff up on lamb (as some people I know like to do). Expect long line ups and slow service in the evenings, especially on cold, frigid weekends. You'll also end up wreaking of hotpot smell, so be sure to dress casually."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was 2 years ago, and I remember it being awesome, but the recent reviews made me nervous. After revisiting it, I'm happy to say that it's just as good as I remember. Plentiful fresh meat and an enormous selection of noodles, veggies, seafood, and more. The hot appetizers were great as well. We all couldn't stop eating the fried dough buns. The staff is efficient and the restaurant as a whole is clean and elegant. The only thing I'd complain about is the price, which is at least $25/person, but you are paying for all-you-can-eat meat and we all ate until it hurt, so I guess that's fair enough. 

I really love this restaurant and am still puzzled by the bad reviews. I don't have any other hot pot restaurants where I'm from so maybe I just don't have anything else to compare it to? Who knows, but my family has had great experiences both times we've been here."}
{"text":"My first time trying Mongolian style hot pot! Similar to Korean bbq, with hot plate in front of you and a menu of ingredients to choose from. You have 3 rounds in each you can order any number of toppings, including meat and vegetables. We lasted two rounds. The soup base is offered in spicy or non-spicy. I wish I had tried non-spicy now that I think back.

The spicy soup contains alot of cloves and red chillies, so not for the faint of heart! Among ingredients, you can add, mushrooms daikon, spinach, sweet potato, Chinese dumplings to name a few! 

Way too much to finish in one sitting. It's kind of all you can eat but they cap the rounds of orders you can make here.

I enjoyed adding mushrooms and lamb slivers to my soup, \"Cooking\" is easy you just add your ingredients into the pot and let it slowly boil on the hot plate.

Not bad but wish I had eaten more! Recommend for those who are into hot pot cooking!"}
{"text":"After seeing Mongolian Hot Pot featured on insauga I chose to go here for Saturday's lunch. We arrived around 1:30 pm and they were quite busy. However, we were seated and helped very quickly. Service is pretty good for a new restaurant. The restaurant is very open and the decor is nice. It looks way nicer than Congee Dynasty.

What I didn't like was that we had to pay for the dinner price even when we were there during lunch time. So regardless of the time if you go on weekends you're paying $22.99/person. Additionally, you are charged anywhere from $1.50-$2.50 for the soup. I thought the soy milk was included in the price but it's an additional $1.50.

By the time we left we were stuffed! The food was good and the broth was tasty. I really enjoyed the seafood options. Other hot pot places give you a limit on how much seafood you could get. However, it looks like you are allowed three rounds of orders based on the order sheet.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place, very authentic and reasonable price. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"It's all you can eat, there is an option for you to get your own individual soup pot or a group pot, there is a buffet of cold side dishes, ice cream and drinks are also included in pricing, food is delicious, service is awesome, wish they have this this my city."}
{"text":"Absolutely my FAVOURITE hotpot place in Toronto by far! The food is fresh, service is fast & great (compared to most hotpot places I've been too), and I love the buffet-style setup which allows customers to just grab what they want and how much they want without having to holler servers and write on those pesky papers."}
