{"text":"Great Mexican food here. 
Definitely not a place to go if you are in a hurry...it doesn't take forever, but this is not express Mex either.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went in with a $20 Groupon for take out. When we told Brenda we had the Groupon she told us it was for dine in only. We explained it was $20 toward take out. She then told us we had to purchase a minimum of $25 to utilize the Groupon. When we told her the Groupon didn't stipulate a minimum purchase she said we had to purchase a minimum of $25 or the register wouldn't take the Groupon. We decided to purchase the minimum, so we could utilize the Groupon. The food was alright, but we were disappointed with the customer service. Several days after our visit I called to ask about the minimum requirement to use the Groupon and was told the same thing. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that he was there, but that he didn't speak English. Then, I was told that if I wanted to stop by with an interpreter the manager would tell me the same thing. At that point the woman hung up the phone."}
{"text":"To begin with the have no torta or no birria 
I ask for burritos Just meat with beans and rice aside. The burrito only had 6 piece of meat and full of beans and I order a meat ball soup smallest bowl for 3.75. Next
Time I will drive 30 min to Avondale"}
{"text":"Being new to Buckeye I wanted to find a local Mexican eatery to call home.  Unfortunately this isn't it.  At 3:30 I placed my order, received it at 4:30.  I've eaten at hundreds of Mexican restaurants and this may be in the bottom 12.  Food was dry, tasteless  and in general terrible.  I generally don't give one star reviews.  This place deserves it."}
{"text":"Me sister and I ate hear Friday night. Was about 6:30 pm and only 3 tables filled and they were all leaving. We sat down, got waited on right away. Ordered food. And then we wait. And we wait. And we wait. 1 and a hours later.......... Food comes, cold, no seasoning............won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Great margaritas!!  Food was as expected, but delish nonetheless for the price point.  My only complaint is that the entire restaurant smelled of manure, most certainly not to the fault of the restaurant.  Must've been a crop field or stable nearby and it just so happened to be downwind.  Pretty rough to sit through for a meal though.  Maybe air fresheners???"}
{"text":"This place is not good. And they are SO slow! It shouldn't take 45 minutes to an hour to get some nachos, tacos and burritos. And I wouldn't consider this authentic Mexican food. Waste of time and money. Won't go back and definitely won't be recommending this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a take out order. The food was great but the wait was a little long seeing I was the only customer in the place."}
{"text":"The food was super authentic Mexican quisine. The salsa was the perfect way to start the meal. The drink menu was appropriate  to compliment the food that was served. 

The food was delicious and served in a very timely fashion.

Lastly, we could take salsa and homemade tortilla chips to go.

Great experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had never been here so we decided to give it a try. We arrived at the restaurant at about 7:45pm and the server warned us they were a little busy and it would be about twenty minutes before we would be served our meals. Fast forward an hour later , we still haven't been served and my boyfriend asks how much longer and the waitress says five more minutes. Fifteen more minutes later around 9:00pm we finally were served our meals. The food was only ok. I was not impressed for have waited over an out to have gotten our food. My boyfriends tortillas were swimming in grease he did not even eat them or even finish the meal he said it was so bad  (he got the enchi-tacos) and I ordered the chicken chimichanga which was plain unseasoned chicken in a fried tortilla with a pinch of shredded lettuce on the side.  There were at least three groups of customers that walked out while waiting. It was just really disappointing and the servers didn't even care. They would just come by the table and drop chips or drinks with no acknowledgement.  I do not recommend this restaurant. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The hard shell tacos are excellent. The chile relleno is awesome, especially the chicken version. But wow, this place is super slow, like literally (we were told) 1 cook in the kitchen slow. The first visit (lunch) took 45 minutes from seat to food. The second visit (dinner) took over an hour. To make this sad situation worse, the overall customer service from the hostess/server was sketchy. Slow, nonchalant service. During the second visit one of the ladies was on the phone yelling at some girl to get home because her boyfriend was looking for her. It was awkward. The place has potential if they staffed it properly and were more professional."}
{"text":"Read all bad reviews and still decided to give them a try, as I am an avid Mexican food lover, and not too many selections in Buckeye. I walked in, and got nothing but a cold look from the hostess. I ended up having to grab my own menu, and assumed I seat myself. As I sat there for 15 minutes looking over the menu, no one ever came to take my order.  While I can't speak to the quality of the food, the customer service is the worst I've seen. Guess they don't like business. What a waste. Only got a 1 star because I can't give none."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food! Our server was so sweet and very friendly. Local girl with a bubbly personality! Ask for Sabrina!"}
{"text":"The margaritas were cold and so were my tacos but when they were sent back they were returned piping hot, fresh out of the microwave! They sure were hot and tuff and chewy and well...ruined. Very bad food and the service was on par with the food. First time there and I will give them one more chance. Everyone gets a second chance, right? 

Bob  P."}
{"text":"Amazing food from start to finish! I wanted some good authentic Mexican food so I drive 45 minutes and it was worth it! The food was fresh to order with amazing salsa and the service was great! We got our food within great timing.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had an egg and cheese burrito and it was excellent. The salsa is the best in town.
They are open for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went to Lalos' last night for dinner but didn't expect to be treated the way we were. The moment I presented the Groupon I PURCHASED, the server stated they would not except it because they were under new management and to try and get a refund from Groupon. Her attitude was as if I wanted something for free. Icing on the cake is these thieves are still on the Groupon selling vouchers they will not honor!!!"}
{"text":"Now called Lalo's. Quick good service. No frills great prices. Have the # 12!!!  The carnitas was awesome. Juicy tender pork, cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Super sad that I have to write such a negative review on a place that I was praying I would love. I have lived in buckeye for 3 years & I tried this restaurant when it was Lalo's. Needless to say we never went back. So my family & I were excited to give it another try since it is under new management. 
Went in around 6 p.m. and they were out of guacamole (come on, that's the best part!!) steak, & their chunky beef. Oh, my kids love horchata & according to their new yelp pictures.. they have it. Well not anymore. 
Still ordering with an open mind.. my husband & I are dying for a good Mexican restaurant around town... we proceed to order. Food finally came out & I dig into my shrimp fajitas... omg!! I have never tasted so much salt in my life. And I put salt on EVERYTHING! I look at my husband and he immediately looked at me and spit out his ground beef burrito. Salty!! I don't know if the cooks got salt happy but everything was salty.. our rice, our beans, our whole meal. 
So disappointed. We really wanted to love this place. 
Maybe we will try again in another 3 years."}
{"text":"Great food,  affordably priced. Fast, friendly service! Authentic! Taco Tuesday's has 99 cent carne asada tacos!! Can't beat that !"}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada street tacos, they were very delicious, meat had great taste and salsa was just perfect amount of spice! My boyfriend ordered one of each taco (chicken, al pastor, asada and carnitas) all of which had really good flavor. Service was great, they came over to ask if we wanted more chips while our food came out and refilled our drinks. We both had agua de horchata (sweet rice water) which went perfect with our tacos. Over all had a great experience at Conde's Mexican food restaurant and recommend it to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Our group had enchiladas, tacos, and a few different soups.  All good!  The lady running the place knows how to hook it up with liquor!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great.


The service is terrible as well as the owner.
I used a Groupon which is valued at $20. They tried to tel me I was required to spend $26 to use my Groupon. It does not say that ANYWHERE on the Groupon. I'm highly disappointed.
I asked to speak to the owner and he refused to come out, saying \"he was too busy\". 

We absolutely won't be back.

It's really unfortunate because they have good food. But their lack of professionalism and knowledge in running a business will get them nowhere. They've lost me as a customer and I will not be recommending them to anyone."}
{"text":"First time here and I gotta say the ceviche was on point ,very good so far! now I won't have to drive far for some good ceviche, definitely coming back for more. Good customer service"}
{"text":"We tried out this little restaurant this evening.  The service was excellent and the food was very good.  It is a small family business with lots of charm.  They even break their own rules to make sure you get it the way you want."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I'm sad it turned out to be disappointing.  Ordered take out, my taco (that was supposed to be chicken) turned out to be ground beef and I wouldn't even call it ground beef, the consistency reminded me of Jack in the box meat in their tacos. The taco was soggy and fell apart before I could even eat it. They forgot my rice and beans, which wasn't all that bad because my sons rice and beans had a long hair in it. The chips are fried tostada shells, that was the best part of the meal. My advice: hair nets and extra staff to ensure the accuracy of orders."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everyone is always so friendly. They have the best salsa and everything I have tried has tasted so good always so fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chile Relleno combo and was extremely disappointed. First off, the \"combo\" consist of 1 chilie relleno and a small portion of beans. Second, I'm pretty sure the pepper wasn't even the correct kind. It was bright green, much smaller than the original pepper and it was a bit hard/crunchy. Lastly, the portion size was a joke!! 

My husband wanted pastor tacos and the waitress came back to the table stating they ran out of the meat (wasn't even close to dinner time yet). We were there for 45 min and not 1 other person walked through that door. If you're going to run a restaurant, you better make sure you have enough food...that's embarrassing to have to come out and say \"Sorry we ran out!\" 

Father in law ordered shrimp fajitas, he said something was off with the taste and texture of the shrimp so he stopped eating it. 

Don't waste your time and money here. I recommend La Fiesta on MC 85. I've gone multiple times and haven't been dissatisfied yet."}
{"text":"We got there about 6. We were seated right away& got our drinks. Waitress was very nice. We ordered our food and then it was down hill from there. We waited...... & waited.... & waited Finally our food arrived at 7!!! One hour later. It was very bland no flavor at all!probably the worse Mexican food I've ever had! We will never go back."}
{"text":"Tacos of Asada are Horrible (Dry Asada) Bits of 
Meat not Chunks . No flavor Not fresh i will not be returing sorry ."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys Lalo's food.  We have tried just about everything on the menu, but my favorite is the spinach enchiladas with green chile sauce.  Their salsa is also very good.  We like to call ahead and then just pick up the food to go.  The staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I have ever seen let alone eaten. It was flavorless and sad to look at. Never again. They should allow negative ratings on Yelp."}
{"text":"Disappointing all the way around... I came in around 6:30pm on a Tuesday night, no other patrons in the restaurant. The hostess was unfriendly and short with me. I ordered the carne asada burrito to go. It took 10 min which is why this post got a one star, but the food was plain, unappetizing, and the hostess didn't even bother putting utensils or napkins in the bag. I asked her for some tortilla chips and she looked irritated, like why the hell am I making her work more. Two thumbs down... Will never eat here again. Now I have a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for the first time last night for dinner I ate shredded beef tacos and he had seafood enchiladas, both were really good. We are from California and have high standards for our Mexican food this place will defiantly be our go to Mexican food place and it's right down the street which makes it even better. Ps the salsa is good to!"}
{"text":"Well I guess we 
have new owners but no worries the food is super good delivered fresh & hot & delicious staff wonderful very enjoyable the beer was ice cold as well"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from a road trip. Enchiladas were very good. Tacos were also excellent. Chips, salsa, rice, and beans were also great. My favorite Mexican dish is a chili reilano. I was anticipating a great one due to the other food. I like them crispy and cheesy and hot. It was soggy and wrapped In a scrambled egg. I wouldn't write the place off because everything else was fantastic. I just wouldn't order that one item. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! I had the spinach con queso enchiladas and my husband had the ground beef enchiladas with green sauce. Our kids had chicken strips and an open face cheese crisp. Happy hour 2-6 with $1 off beer. The service was fast but there was only one other table full at the time we went. We like this place for a change of our normal mexican restaurant. Try it out but get here early."}
{"text":"Since Conde's took over LaLos it's improved 100%. 
Staff is super friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Phoenix to Buckeye to try this place out. It was worth the drive DVD we'll be back.  Good chips and salsa, awesome tacos, best cheese enchilada I've had in a long time, and yummy margarita satisfied my hunger!"}
{"text":"Food was ok not worth the money, very small portions for the price, plus they hardly give you any meat! I would of gave two stars but the fact that they don't use filtered water and give straight tap buckeye water nasty"}
{"text":"My family of 4 went into Lalo's and will NEVER go again! The food was tasteless, the salsa was decent, but I could buy the salsa from any supermarket around, and when I went in, there were 4 other tables there, and from start to finish we spent about 1 hour and 45 minutes there mainly waiting for our food. Keep in mind, my husband and I ordered just about the same thing and my children got one order of chicken fingers and fries. There was one server (who wasn't the friendliest person) and I'm assuming one chef. When we received our food it was supposed to come with guacamole and pico de gallo and came with neither. The only \"pico\" I got was a bed of lettuce with about 10 cubed tomatoes on top. The main dish was carne asada and it had ZERO flavor, Spanish rice was no different, and the refried beans you can taste it came straight from a can. On top of everything it was expensive for the quality. My husband and I frequent quite a bit of Mexican food restaurants and this is not even in the ballpark of being decent. There was a funny part in the menu that did say \"para los gringos\" which means \"for the white people\" with a list of burgers and fries. I found it funny, but I'm sure it's bound to offend someone. Worst restaurant I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"This is a really great Mexican restaurant I always get the shredded beef tacos and the Carne Asada enchlilads and they are to die for! Nice place great people who work there!"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of Lalo's. The food is not great but it's better than some other places. I would give them four stars, but the service does kind of suck most of the time. Seriously understaffed with people who seem like they would rather be elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great takes a while for the food but worth the wait, i love the bartender she is amazing and very nice. I think this is a hidden gem in buckeye so open your eyes and your mouth,because good food is here in our town!i love the fresh chips and salsa and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Great service, great service!  Only thought recommendation...  The carne asada could use more flavor, kind of bland."}
{"text":"The food tasted really fresh and flavorful. I liked the chips and salsa a lot too! The iced tea was really weak/watery, but I admit I'm picky with iced tea. I had the carne asada tacos which came with the carne asada inside one corn torilla. I wish it was the double tortilla style like at other places because they ripped open when picked up. The service was great as well!

Only issue I had was the slightly oddly worded menu section that said, \"Para los Gringos\" which basically means, \"For the White People\" or you could take it as  simply \"For the Americans/Non-Hispanics or Latinos\" and it lists things such as burgers and fries/stereotypical food from the United States, etc. Just a heads up if that bothers you. A decent little sit-down Mexican restaurant overall though."}
{"text":"Family owned and with the best ceviche ever. This place is authentic. Highly recommend taking the time to visit Buckeye,AZ just to eat here. 
Mahalo"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is fantastic, and prices keep me coming back. If you love tacos stop in on Tuesday for taco Tuesday!! What ever you choose you won't be disappointed. The servers and other employees are what truly make this place such a wonderful place to have authentic Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed won't ever eat here again!  First of all no spicy Mexican food!  I asked if they had some jalapeños or Serrano Chili's on side as I like Spice.  They don't?  What Mexican restaurant doesn't have fresh Chili's?  Beans tasted like they were half real and half Rosarita!  The rice cooked in oil to fast never puffed and flowered and was cooked with way to much tomato Sauce and not enough consume!    Their menu says on some pages \"Para Gringos\". Well some gringos that don't know true Mexican food might love it!  This Gringa. Has her own Molcajeta and was very disappointed!  Salsa is made with canned whole tomatoes and was below average!  Won't eat here again!  They did have a help wanted sign on window?  Possibly looking for a cook?"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out Conde's after all the turkey we ate over thanksgiving.  This place has only been open for about 10 days with the new management. This was my second time here, first time dining in. My take out order was a taco and cheese enchilada.  Enchilada was \"good\" but could use some more cheese.  It was lacking the main ingredient for sure.  The taco - GROSS.  Never wrap hot items in aluminum foil - that is just asking for something soggy, which is what I got.  This taco tasted just like a 2am jack in the box taco run after a night out at the bar!   
I was not impressed at all with my second meal.  Disappointed more so.  I ordered the pork green chili burrito.  It came out as just that.  No frills, etc.  Burrito was pretty large in my opinion.  I cut into it and it was full of pork, which was nice.  When it got to my mouth....not so much.  It has a sweet taste to the mix, which I didn't care for.  I was bummed out.  My husband ordered a combination plate with a taco on it.  I didn't realize otherwise I would have suggested something else, but to his dismay as well, the taco sucked.  Ground beef.  Nothing shredded, etc.
The service was awful.  Never once did either of the two people working (possibly owners) came over to ask how our meal was, never came to refill my drink, nothing, as the man sat at the bar making sure he didn't miss the football he was watching.... here's a thought: how about checking on your customers and making sure they are happy?
To say the least, we will not be returning to this establishment.
Others who wrote their reviews for this place I have a hard time thinking they are valid, unless, it was under yet another owner/management."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  My wife and I walked in and there was no one up front.  We sat down and waited 10 minutes and no one ever came out.  Never had this trouble with old ownership. We got up and left."}
{"text":"We tried conde's for the first time tonight. I shared shredded beef enchiladas with my daughter. They were nice and hot, full of flavor and very filling. The rice and beans were delicious too. The staff was kind and accommodating of my 3 year old who thought she owned the place. My husband ended up coming later and he and our other daughter ordered several of their $.99 tacos for taco Tuesday and they both raves about how good and juicy the meat was. Such a breath of fresh air to have a nice locally owned restaurant. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Good chips, good food, enchilada sauce is excellent.  Salsa quite good as well.  We will be back!  Nice to have a decent Mexican place close by."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, we have enchiladas and tacos, even down to the rice and beans everything was excellent. We have been looking for a good Mexican food place without having to drive out of Buckeye, and we have found it.

Space is very small, and we went on a Friday night, and the host, server, and bartender was all the same person and did an amazing job. 

Will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"Disappointed...long wait for food. Restaurant very warm and uncomfortable seating. Food only ok."}
{"text":"We often come here Friday's for dinner. Have a favorite waitress. The chips and salsa are the best. We got a pitcher of Margaritas last time. Awesome. Really like the food, best we've found so far. I like their chili relleno but if you want crispy, this isn't  for you. enchiladas are good, my husband loves the tacos. Service can be slow but everything is homemade. The flan is just like in Mexico, creamy and yummy, but they run out quick. I would recommend. We do like to support local."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner tonight and it was awful. We stood at the front for a good five minutes trying to find out what was going on. Our waitress was in plain clothes and I was so lost. We waited almost an hour and a half for just wings, a cheese crisp, and a mexilada or something close to that name and I waited another twenty minutes to flag some one down for my silverware. When we got our food the nearly 7$ cheese crisp was so hard and greasy the cheese fell right off of it. We didn't get salsa bowls either. It took them a bit to bring us plastic cups. My nephew ordered wings and they were soggy and horrible. My meal I have to say was the absojtle worst. My \"carne asada\" was pretty scary. This is Arizona. We are spoiled with amazing Mexican food. It was by far worse than what I have had in Colorado where Mexican food is non existent. It was rubber. I also didn't even eat my tortillas ghat were supposed to be enchilada style. I didn't get green chillies on it either as advertised. I was pretty darn upset. She told me they don't have them and then tried to tell me my bell peppers were green chillies like I was an idiot. I then hears her on the phone e saying they didn't have any green chilli. Tortillas..... They were so greesy I threw them and the cheese that was hard on top of them to the side. I basically paid 12$ for a scoop of rice and beans and they weren't to bad. That was about as good as it got. The chips were very stale and the salsa was okay. The service was super slow and frustrating. It was hard to call upon anyone. I really hope that management makes right and refunds our money or discounts for how horrible our whole meal was. Filibertos will probably be my next stop and they are pretty \"fast food Mexican.\" I saw reviews were good and was excited to try. I probably won't be coming back. I wasn't even going to wait around to tell someone about the food and service I was already there for nearly two hours."}
{"text":"Came on a friday night, ate here before and can't remember why we haven't come back.  Table was dirty, no green sauce so couldn't have spinach con queso enchiladas I ordered, our total order was 2 shredded beef tacos and a beef tamale.  TACOS WERE DELICIOUS but small."}
{"text":"Drove 20 mins to get there because I got a Groupon for it. And it was CLOSED... under new management.... disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"Good price, friendly service and food was really good! Didn't care for the ice tea and salsa is a bit spicy but really good. Defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"Best shredded beef in town! The shredded beef chimi is to die for and the beans are delicious. Very generous with the cheese here. Sometimes it's a bit of a wait, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Finally good authentic Mexican food!! They create and make the food taste so good and fresh. Great happy hour too !"}
{"text":"Best margaritas in several states! Wish I had asked the waiter's name who made them. Fresh and tasty food as well. Don't let the strip mall frontage turn you away, the offerings are delicious. Good prices and friendly service. Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Had to run up to Buckeye after work and decided to try this place. Food wasn't bad, nothing to write home about, the service was friendly but very slow. Place wasn't crowded but still took about 30 minutes after we ordered to get our food."}
{"text":"Condes Mexican Food opened during the fall of 2017. Don't be confused the older reviews you see here from that time that was left for Lalos. Lalos had a big problem of the food taking way to long to cook. Condes Mexican Food has your food ready in a timely manner. I think the Condes Mexican Food is more authentic than Lalos ever was."}
